The president and House Republicans continued to snipe at each other Wednesday over the impending set of automatic tax hikes and spending cuts known as the fiscal cliff . They traded accusations and blame during another day with plenty of talk , but — until late in the day , at least — no negotiations .
The Associated Press , citing a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner , said President Obama and Boehner spoke briefly Wednesday afternoon by phone . `` The call raises the possibility that negotiations will soon resume between the White House and congressional leaders , '' the AP reported .
Earlier in the day , the two sides were speaking publicly , but not to one another . The Republicans went first :
`` We want to sit down with the president . We want to talk specifics , '' said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia . `` We put an offer on the table now . He 's out of hand rejected that . Where are the specifics ? Where are the discussions ? Nothing is going on . ''
`` If the president does n't agree with our proposal and our outline , I think he 's got an obligation to send one to the Congress — and a plan that can pass both chambers of Congress . If you look at the plans that the White House has talked about thus far , they could n't pass either house of the Congress . ''
Of course , neither could the plan Boehner has tabled , with a promise of $ 800 billion in revenue raised by closing unspecified tax loopholes .
The White House spent a considerable amount of effort in public on Wednesday trying to demolish the mathematical and political premises of that proposal .
White House economic adviser Jason Furman gave reporters a detailed handout explaining why — unless you wanted to eliminate or severely curtail tax deductions for the middle class or for charitable giving — the Republican plan would only produce $ 450 billion in revenue , not $ 800 billion .
President Obama went before the Business Roundtable , a group of corporate CEOs who have not been friendly to him in the past , to suggest that no deal could be done until the Republicans gave in on raising tax rates . Said Obama :
`` Now , we 've seen some movement over the last several days among some Republicans . I think there 's a recognition that maybe they can accept some rate increases as long as it 's combined with serious entitlement reform and additional spending cuts . If we can get the leadership on the Republican side to take that framework , to acknowledge that reality , then the numbers actually are n't that far apart . ''
In which case , the president said , we could get a deal in about a week .
But that makes it sound too easy . Raising tax rates is by far the most difficult issue for Republicans and would probably have to be addressed with a creative plan to help Boehner deal with opposition among his conservative House majority .
But White House officials seemed to be suggesting that Obama might not even sit down with Republicans at the negotiating table until they cried uncle on tax rates .
On Wednesday , Obama also delivered a warning to Republicans not to tie the fiscal cliff debate to the fight over raising the country 's borrowing limit :
`` If Congress in any way suggests that they 're going to tie negotiations to debt ceiling votes and take us to the brink of default once again as part of a budget negotiation — which by the way we have never done in our history until we did it last year — I will not play that game . ''
The president once again sketched out a two-step process : By the end of this year , come up with a down payment on revenues , spending cuts and entitlement reforms . And then : `` We have open running room next year to deal with a whole host of other issues like infrastructure , tax reform and immigration reform that will further make America Inc. competitive ; that 's one option , '' said Obama .","Obama And House GOP Engage In Fiscal Cliff Talks, Only Briefly With Each Other

The income tax increase for these groups would be about $ 26 billion to $ 30 billion per year , depending on the methodology one uses to project federal revenues .
Element 2 : Elongate sequestration , the roughly $ 100 billion in automatic spending cuts - half from the Department of Defense , half from non-defense programs – to three years . Instead , in 2013 , cut $ 20 billion from DOD and $ 20 billion from non-defense programs , and cut the same amount in 2014 and 2015 . Hence , over three years , the total cuts will be even larger - $ 120 billion as opposed to $ 100 billion – good for a $ 40 billion spending reduction each year .
Element 3 : Increase the payroll tax that funds Social Security to its normal rate , 6.2 percent , from 4.2 percent , over two years : to 5.2 percent in 2013 , and to 6.2 percent in 2014 . This would reduce the budget deficit by about $ 48 billion each year .
Element 4 : Let business expense tax write-offs , and other business tax provisions , expire over two years : half in 2013 , and half in 2014 . This would further reduce the deficit by about $ 30 billion per year .
The aforementioned tax and spending changes would cut the budget deficit by an equal amount -- about $ 148 billion -- in both 2013 and 2014 , which would decrease the projected budget deficit to $ 980 billion in 2013 , and $ 832 billion in 2014 .

The LBJ Method

To be sure, a major agreement on the federal budget is preferred. Oh, would that we had President Lyndon B. Johnson – or at least the spirit of LBJ – in the White House today. Johnson would lock both Republicans and Democrats in an upstairs White House meeting room, then announce, with Texas encouragement, “Now don’t knock on the door to be let out of the room, until you’ve got a budget deal.” But the LBJ era, this isn’t, hence turning the fiscal slope into the “bunny slope” is the most viable tack, and it contains four elements:

The script for a fiscal cliff deal was always supposed to be simple: Democrats would win on taxes. Republicans would win on entitlements.

But what kind of victory can Republicans really hope to win? They’re going to have to lower their sights — by a lot — from the big ideas they pushed in the presidential campaign.

Story Continued Below

Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan wanted to turn Medicare into a competition between private plans. They wanted to scale back Medicaid, and turn it into block grants for states.

( PHOTOS: Fiscal cliff's key players)

Nothing like that is remotely likely now. With Obama in the White House for another four years, Republicans are looking for something much smaller, even a down payment on Medicare, that they can still call a victory.

And even that scaled back agenda carries the risk that they’ll become the party that owns Medicare cuts — a policy victory, but a political loss.

For Democrats, it’s easy to see what victory means: getting Republicans to raise taxes on the rich. For Republicans, it’s less dramatic. The outer edge of what they could get from Obama would be an increase in the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67 — maybe with some expanded means-testing of Medicare premiums for the wealthy. (There’s already some of that in Obama’s own health care reform law and in the 2003 law that created the Medicare prescription drug program.)

Would those changes be enough to allow Republicans to claim victory? Sure, Republican operatives and conservative analysts are saying — because they’ll have to be.

“They’re not as significant as I would like them to be, but they’d be a reasonable step along the right path. They might set in motion a dynamic where you could get both parties to do more later on,” said Peter Wehner, a former adviser to President George W. Bush who’s now a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.

Charlie Black, a Republican strategist and former adviser to Sen. John McCain, argued that “what our guys are focused on is making some progress in not continuing to run up the debt by trillions of dollars.”

But are the most realistic Medicare changes in the fiscal cliff scenario what Republicans had in mind? Not even close. And right now, they’re not rushing out to make the case that the GOP is on the verge of a big win.

“These are all good ideas … but they’re not transformational. You just can’t say, ‘Whew, we fixed it for the next generation.’ You just can’t say that,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum and another former McCain adviser.

“You wanted steak, and you ended up with reheated hamburger,” Holtz-Eakin added.

So what’s the best thing to do with reheated hamburger? Prepare your base by lowering the expectations.

Republican leaders are insisting — loudly — that Obama just doesn’t want to do anything on entitlements.

An end-of-the-year deadline fast-approaching , the debt ceiling is emerging as perhaps the biggest sticking point in negotiations .
The speaker , in a possible breakthrough toward a deal , last week offered Obama a compromise by proposing a tax rate hike on those making over $ 1 million .

An end-of-the-year deadline fast-approaching, the debt ceiling is emerging as perhaps the biggest sticking point in negotiations.

The speaker, in a possible breakthrough toward a deal, last week offered Obama a compromise by proposing a tax rate hike on those making over $1 million. However, the speaker's office insists that Boehner will stand by his condition that the debt ceiling be raised only if Washington cuts spending by an amount greater than the increase.

The debt ceiling issue was emerging as a sticking point, not just between Boehner and Obama but between Boehner and his Republican caucus.

Boehner's office tried to assure conservatives on Sunday that he was not backing off his debt-ceiling demands, following a report in The Washington Post that he offered to push off any battle over the debt ceiling for another year.

Boehner's office called the story ""highly misleading.""

""Our position has not changed,"" Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said. ""Any debt limit increase would require cuts and reforms of a greater amount.""

Boehner and other Republicans have so far refused Obama's demand that he be given the authority to raise the debt ceiling whenever he wants. At issue, though, appears to be whether to include a one-time increase in the debt ceiling as part of this deal.

Some Republicans would prefer to mount a separate fight to extract massive spending cuts in exchange for an increase in the debt ceiling early next year.

HATFIELD, Pa. — President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) finished another week without a fiscal cliff deal, not even agreeing on how the negotiations are going.

Obama expressed optimism as he took his case on the road here Friday, saying Democrats and Republicans “can and will work together.”

Boehner, however, countered: “Right now, we’re almost nowhere.”

Obama struck a playful tone throughout his speech at a toy factory to warn Americans that they could be in for a “lump of coal” for Christmas if Congress fails to extend current middle-class tax rates.

“Everybody here, you’ll see your taxes go up on Jan. 1,” Obama said at a Rodon Group plant, where more than 95 percent of the parts for K’NEX construction toys are made. “I’m assuming that doesn’t sound too good to you. That’s sort of like the lump of coal you get for Christmas. That’s a Scrooge Christmas.”

But, the president said, House Republicans can prevent that fate “by doing what we all agree on” and extending current tax cuts on the first $250,000 of income. “Let’s go ahead and take the fear out for the vast majority of American families,” he said.

As he has before, Obama vowed to quickly sign legislation extending the tax cuts. “There are no shortage of pens in the White House, and I carry one around for an emergency, just in case,” he said.

“I’ve been keeping my own naughty and nice list for Washington,” Obama said. “So you should keep your eye on who gets some K’NEX this year. There are going to be some members of Congress who get them and some who don’t.”

Boehner was not in the mood for jokes, though.

Fox News confirms that House Republicans plan to meet with small business owners and governors this coming week. Obama returned to the stump last week to make his case for tax hikes on top earners, and has also turned to his campaign operation to rally the base.

He also plans to field questions on Twitter at 2 p.m. ET on Monday about his plan.

The plan underscored how the post-election period has only pushed Republicans and Democrats further apart.

`` It 's hard to think of anything that could feed the cynicism of the American people more than larding up must-pass emergency legislation with giveaways to special interests and campaign contributors , '' Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz. , said in a statement .
Sen. Bob Corker , R-Tenn. , who like McCain approved the bill , described it as a `` terrible vote to have to take '' -- and said the package is a reminder of `` why we need tax reform to do away with those loopholes . ''
Corker noted that the tax breaks in the package were already in the law , and were merely extended for another year by Tuesday 's vote .
Businesses have grown accustomed to many of the longstanding tax breaks , but they also have had to get used to the uncertainty of whether they will be renewed each year . This time around the tax breaks were allowed to expire at the end of 2011 as lawmakers struggled to reach consensus on a wide range of tax issues . The package passed by Congress this week and signed by President Obama renews the tax breaks retroactively , so taxpayers can claim them on both their 2012 and 2013 tax returns .
-- A rule allowing TV and film producers to write off the first $ 15 million in production costs inside the U.S . The value over 10 years of that provision is pegged at $ 248 million .
-- A provision allowing motorsport race tracks to more quickly write off improvement costs , valued at $ 78 million . McCain described it as `` tax incentives for NASCAR track builders . ''
-- A 50 percent tax credit for expenses related to railroad track maintenance through 2013 -- worth $ 331 million .
-- Increased tax rebates to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands from a tax on rum imported into the United States . The U.S. imposes a $ 13.50 per proof-gallon tax on imported rum , and sends most of the proceeds to the two U.S. territories . The tax break is worth $ 222 million over 10 years .
-- A tax credit of up to $ 2,500 for buying electric-powered vehicles was expanded to include electric-powered motorcycles , at a cost of $ 7 million .
-- A tax credit for the production of wind , solar and other renewable energy , at a cost of $ 12.2 billion .

`` They were just crammed into the bill literally in the middle of the night , '' McCain told Fox News Radio . `` The American people deserve better and we have now earned their well deserved disdain about the way we do business .

The administration brought home the possibility that a painful series of automatic tax increases and spending cuts will go into effect with the new year if no agreement is reached. The White House Office of Management and Budget asked agencies this week for information about how they would institute the deep spending cuts if there were no deal.

Republicans called on Mr. Obama to dispense with the public campaign and begin serious negotiations. Speaker John A. Boehner did not give an inch Wednesday on his opposition to raising tax rates or insistence that any deficit-reduction plan emphasize spending cuts.

But he sounded exasperated as he insisted that he had moved toward the president’s position by agreeing to $800 billion in higher tax revenue over 10 years by curtailing tax breaks. “The revenues we’re putting on the table will come from guess who?

In a meeting with editors and reporters of The ███ , Mr. Norquist , the head of Americans for Tax Reform and father of the group ’ s influential “ no new taxes ” pledges , said Republicans are at a tipping point after 20 years of building their anti-tax brand , and the most disastrous thing lawmakers in the GOP could do is put their “ fingerprints ” on a tax increase . It would be better for the party , he said , to get no deal than to sign on to tax hikes .
The influential conservative said that in order for Republicans to come out on top in their showdown with President Obama , every fiscal cliff meeting from here on out should be public .
That , he said , would stop the White House from “ lying ” to the public about how the president wants to handle the “ cliff ” — the expiration of the George W. Bush-era tax cuts and the $ 110 billion in automatic cuts to domestic and defense spending scheduled to kick in early next year , thanks to the bipartisan deal lawmakers carved out last summer to raise the nation ’ s borrowing limit .
“ Everything has to be in front of cameras , ” Mr. Norquist said , adding that it would be “ much more difficult ” for Republicans to come out on top if they continue to meet behind closed doors , because Democrats are saying one thing privately and another thing publicly . “ They have been lying about their willingness to reform entitlements . ”
He also said Republicans should demand that whatever agreement the two parties reach should be posted online for at least a week before Congress votes on it .
Democrats and Republicans appear to be worlds apart in negotiations over how to avoid the fiscal cliff . Republican leaders are balking at the White House demand that taxes increase on families making at least $ 250,000 a year .
Republicans also slammed the budget framework that the White House floated last week , saying Mr. Obama and congressional Democrats need to “ get serious ” about spending cuts .
Mr. Norquist said the drumbeat for more transparency is building on Capitol Hill . He pointed to the demand last week by Sen. Jeff Sessions , Alabama Republican , that the talks “ be taken out of the shadows . ”
“ With public debate , people would learn facts that are now obscured , ” Mr . Sessions said .
Mr. Norquist has become a central player in the debate on Capitol Hill , thanks in large part to a handful of Republican lawmakers who have signaled a willingness to walk away from the Norquist anti-tax pledge .
That break in party ranks has created an opening for Democratic lawmakers , who have encouraged their Republican colleagues to rethink the Norquist pledge .
Standing on the floor of the Senate last week , Sen. Charles E. Schumer , New York Democrat , said Mr. Norquist is now “ out on an island ” on taxes and that more Republicans are warming to the idea of letting some of the tax cuts expire .
“ Grover Norquist has had a good run . It lasted far longer than 15 minutes . But his stringent views make him an outlier now , ” Mr. Schumer said .
Mr. Norquist , though , brushed aside the notion that Republicans are poised to abandon the pledge and criticized the news media for ignoring the fact that the GOP lawmakers who are flirting with a tax increase also are demanding serious changes to Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid that Democrats have been unwilling to accept .
“ Nobody has actually voted for a tax increase , ” he said . “ Nobody has raised his hand to say , ‘ I want to vote for a tax increase. ’ They ’ ve all said , ‘ I might under certain circumstances , if a pink unicorn was given to me , then I would do that . ’ ”
Mr. Norquist was more critical of Republicans such as Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma , who has suggested backing a stopgap deal that would prevent taxes , at least temporarily , from increasing for families making less than $ 250,000 next year .
That tactic puts “ marbles under Boehner ’ s feet ” in the negotiations , Mr. Norquist said . He said Republicans should fight to extend the Bush-era tax cuts across the board — even if that means going off the fiscal cliff — in order to save the anti-tax brand they have developed over more than two decades .
Lower rates will drive more economic growth , Mr. Norquist said , and generate more federal revenue that could help pay down the soaring national debt .
“ [ Democrats ] , however , aren ’ t interested in more money . They are interested in Republican fingerprints on a tax increase so they can crush the modern Republican Party , ” Mr. Norquist said .
The 56-year-old anti-tax crusader , who founded Americans for Tax Reform in 1985 , has rejected assertions by critics and skeptics who argue that the November election results reflect a repudiation of his group and other fiscal hard-liners .
In recent days , Mr. Norquist has become a fixture on cable news shows , defending the tax pledge , the tea party movement and fiscal conservatism .
In an appearance Sunday on NBC ’ s “ Meet the Press , ” he predicted a huge midterm backlash fueled by the tea party if the solution or the failure to reach a deal on the fiscal cliff results in higher tax bills .

fiscal_cliff,Ann Coulter,2,http://townhall.com/columnists/anncoulter/2012/12/05/america_nears_el_tipping_pointo,America Nears El Tipping Pointo,2012-12-05,"""Cortney OBrien"", Leah Barkoukis, Julio Rosas, Reagan Mccarthy, Matt Vespa","I apologize to America 's young people , whose dashed dreams and dim employment prospects I had laughed at , believing these to be a direct result of their voting for Obama .
On closer examination , it turns out that young voters , aged 18-29 , overwhelmingly supported Romney . But only the white ones .
According to Pew Research , 54 percent of white voters under 30 voted for Romney and only 41 percent for Obama . That 's the same percentage Reagan got from the entire white population in 1980 . Even the Lena Dunham demographic -- white women under 30 -- slightly favored Romney .
Reagan got just 43 percent of young voters in 1980 -- and that was when whites were 88 percent of the electorate . Only 58 percent of today 's under-30 vote is white and it 's shrinking daily .
What the youth vote shows is not that young people are nitwits who deserve lives of misery and joblessness , as I had previously believed , but that America is hitting the tipping point on our immigration policy .
The youth vote is a snapshot of elections to come if nothing is done to reverse the deluge of unskilled immigrants pouring into the country as a result of Ted Kennedy 's 1965 immigration act . Eighty-five percent of legal immigrants since 1968 have come from the Third World . A majority of them are in need of government assistance .
Whites are 76 percent of the electorate over the age of 30 and only 58 percent of the electorate under 30 . Obama won the `` youth vote '' because it is the knife 's edge of a demographic shift , not because he offered the kids free tuition and contraception ( which they do n't need because it 's hard to have sex when you 're living with your parents at 27 ) .
In 1980 , Hispanics were only 2 percent of the population , and they tended to be educated , skilled workers who got married , raised their children in two-parent families and sent their kids to college before they , too , got married and had kids . ( In that order . )
That profile has nothing to do with recent Hispanic immigrants , who -- because of phony `` family reunification '' rules -- are the poorest of the world 's poor .
More than half of all babies born to Hispanic women today are illegitimate . As Heather MacDonald has shown , the birthrate of Hispanic women is twice that of the rest of the population , and their unwed birthrate is one and a half times that of blacks .
That 's a lot of government dependents coming down the pike . No amount of `` reaching out '' to the Hispanic community , effective `` messaging '' or Reagan 's `` optimism '' is going to turn Mexico 's underclass into Republicans .
Any election analysis that does n't deal with the implacable fact of America 's changing demographics is bound to be wrong .
Perhaps the reason elections maven Michael Barone was so shockingly off in his election prediction this year was that , in the biggest mistake of his career , Barone has been assuring us for years that most of these Third World immigrants pouring into the country would go the way of Italian immigrants and become Republicans . They 're hardworking ! They have family values !
Maybe at first , but not after coming here , having illegitimate children and going on welfare .
Charles Murray recently pointed out that -- contrary to stereotype -- Hispanics are less likely to be married , less likely to go to church , more supportive of gay marriage and less likely to call themselves `` conservative '' than other Americans .
Rather than being more hardworking than Americans , Hispanics actually work about the same as others , or , in the case of Hispanic women , less .
It seems otherwise , Murray says , because the only Hispanics we see are the ones who are working -- in our homes , neighborhoods and businesses . `` That 's the way that almost all Anglos in the political chattering class come in contact with Latinos , '' he notes . `` Of course they look like model Americans . ''
( Black males would apparently like to work more . Nearly 20 percent of black males under 30 voted for Romney , more than three times what McCain got . )
An article by Nate Cohn in the current New Republic argues , as the title puts it : `` The GOP Has Problems With White Voters , Too . '' As proof , Cohn cites Jefferson County , Colo. ; Loudoun County , Va. ; Wake County , N.C. ; and Somerset County , N.J. , all of which went Republican in presidential elections from 1968 through 2004 , but which Romney lost in 2012 .
Smelling a rat , I checked the demographic shifts in these counties from the 2000 to the 2010 census . In each one , there has been a noticeable influx of Hispanics ( and Asians , who also vote Democrat ) , diminishing `` the white vote '' that Cohn claims Republicans are losing .
Between the 2000 and 2010 census , for example , the white population of Jefferson County declined from more than 90 percent to less than 80 percent , while the Hispanic population more than doubled , from 6 percent to 14 percent .
In Loudoun County , the Asian population tripled from 5 percent to 15 percent and the Hispanic population doubled from 6 percent to 12 percent . Meanwhile , whites plummeted from 83 percent to 69 percent of the population .
Similarly , Wake County shifted from 74 percent white to 66 percent white in the past decade , while the Hispanic population doubled , from 5 percent to 10 percent , and the black population stayed even at about 20 percent .
In Somerset County , the Hispanic population grew by 63 percent and the Asian population grew by 83 percent since 2000 . The number of whites has remained steady , resulting in a population that is now just 62 percent white .
These were the counties chosen by Cohn , not me , to show that Republicans are losing `` the white vote . '' Except they 're not so white , anymore . With blacks , Asians and Hispanics voting 93 percent , 73 percent and 71 percent for Obama , Republicans have to do more than just win the white vote . They have to run the table .
Romney got a larger percentage of the white vote than Reagan did in 1980 . That 's just not enough anymore .
Ironically , Romney was the first Republican presidential candidate in a long time not conspiring with the elites to make America a dumping ground for the world 's welfare cases . Conservatives who denounced Romney as a `` RINO '' were the ones doing the bidding of the real establishment : business , which wants cheap labor and could n't care less if America ceases to be the land of opportunity that everyone wanted to immigrate to in the first place .","I apologize to America's young people, whose dashed dreams and dim employment prospects I had laughed at, believing these to be a direct result of their voting for Obama.

On closer examination, it turns out that young voters, aged 18-29, overwhelmingly supported Romney. But only the white ones.

According to Pew Research, 54 percent of white voters under 30 voted for Romney and only 41 percent for Obama. That's the same percentage Reagan got from the entire white population in 1980. Even the Lena Dunham demographic -- white women under 30 -- slightly favored Romney.

Reagan got just 43 percent of young voters in 1980 -- and that was when whites were 88 percent of the electorate. Only 58 percent of today's under-30 vote is white and it's shrinking daily.

What the youth vote shows is not that young people are nitwits who deserve lives of misery and joblessness, as I had previously believed, but that America is hitting the tipping point on our immigration policy.

The youth vote is a snapshot of elections to come if nothing is done to reverse the deluge of unskilled immigrants pouring into the country as a result of Ted Kennedy's 1965 immigration act. Eighty-five percent of legal immigrants since 1968 have come from the Third World. A majority of them are in need of government assistance.

Whites are 76 percent of the electorate over the age of 30 and only 58 percent of the electorate under 30. Obama won the ""youth vote"" because it is the knife's edge of a demographic shift, not because he offered the kids free tuition and contraception (which they don't need because it's hard to have sex when you're living with your parents at 27).

In 1980, Hispanics were only 2 percent of the population, and they tended to be educated, skilled workers who got married, raised their children in two-parent families and sent their kids to college before they, too, got married and had kids. (In that order.)

That profile has nothing to do with recent Hispanic immigrants, who -- because of phony ""family reunification"" rules -- are the poorest of the world's poor.

More than half of all babies born to Hispanic women today are illegitimate. As Heather MacDonald has shown, the birthrate of Hispanic women is twice that of the rest of the population, and their unwed birthrate is one and a half times that of blacks.

That's a lot of government dependents coming down the pike. No amount of ""reaching out"" to the Hispanic community, effective ""messaging"" or Reagan's ""optimism"" is going to turn Mexico's underclass into Republicans.

Any election analysis that doesn't deal with the implacable fact of America's changing demographics is bound to be wrong.

Perhaps the reason elections maven Michael Barone was so shockingly off in his election prediction this year was that, in the biggest mistake of his career, Barone has been assuring us for years that most of these Third World immigrants pouring into the country would go the way of Italian immigrants and become Republicans. They're hardworking! They have family values!

Maybe at first, but not after coming here, having illegitimate children and going on welfare.

Charles Murray recently pointed out that -- contrary to stereotype -- Hispanics are less likely to be married, less likely to go to church, more supportive of gay marriage and less likely to call themselves ""conservative"" than other Americans.

Rather than being more hardworking than Americans, Hispanics actually work about the same as others, or, in the case of Hispanic women, less.

It seems otherwise, Murray says, because the only Hispanics we see are the ones who are working -- in our homes, neighborhoods and businesses. ""That's the way that almost all Anglos in the political chattering class come in contact with Latinos,"" he notes. ""Of course they look like model Americans.""

(Black males would apparently like to work more. Nearly 20 percent of black males under 30 voted for Romney, more than three times what McCain got.)

An article by Nate Cohn in the current New Republic argues, as the title puts it: ""The GOP Has Problems With White Voters, Too."" As proof, Cohn cites Jefferson County, Colo.; Loudoun County, Va.; Wake County, N.C.; and Somerset County, N.J., all of which went Republican in presidential elections from 1968 through 2004, but which Romney lost in 2012.

Smelling a rat, I checked the demographic shifts in these counties from the 2000 to the 2010 census. In each one, there has been a noticeable influx of Hispanics (and Asians, who also vote Democrat), diminishing ""the white vote"" that Cohn claims Republicans are losing.

Between the 2000 and 2010 census, for example, the white population of Jefferson County declined from more than 90 percent to less than 80 percent, while the Hispanic population more than doubled, from 6 percent to 14 percent.

In Loudoun County, the Asian population tripled from 5 percent to 15 percent and the Hispanic population doubled from 6 percent to 12 percent. Meanwhile, whites plummeted from 83 percent to 69 percent of the population.

Similarly, Wake County shifted from 74 percent white to 66 percent white in the past decade, while the Hispanic population doubled, from 5 percent to 10 percent, and the black population stayed even at about 20 percent.

In Somerset County, the Hispanic population grew by 63 percent and the Asian population grew by 83 percent since 2000. The number of whites has remained steady, resulting in a population that is now just 62 percent white.

These were the counties chosen by Cohn, not me, to show that Republicans are losing ""the white vote."" Except they're not so white, anymore. With blacks, Asians and Hispanics voting 93 percent, 73 percent and 71 percent for Obama, Republicans have to do more than just win the white vote. They have to run the table.

Romney got a larger percentage of the white vote than Reagan did in 1980. That's just not enough anymore.

Ironically, Romney was the first Republican presidential candidate in a long time not conspiring with the elites to make America a dumping ground for the world's welfare cases. Conservatives who denounced Romney as a ""RINO"" were the ones doing the bidding of the real establishment: business, which wants cheap labor and couldn't care less if America ceases to be the land of opportunity that everyone wanted to immigrate to in the first place.",www.townhall.com,right,Xx9DiwqHHSM1qAIY

With the Bush-era tax cuts expiring , Mr. Obama and Democrats have said they want tax rates to rise on income over $ 250,000 a year , while Republicans want a higher threshold , perhaps at $ 400,000 .
Democrats and Republicans are also divided on the tax on inherited estates , which currently hits inheritances over $ 5 million at 35 percent . On Jan. 1 , it is scheduled to rise to 55 percent beginning with inheritances exceeding $ 1 million .
The political drama in Washington over the weekend was given greater urgency by the fear that the economic gains of the past two years could be lost if no deal is reached .

fiscal_cliff,Fox Online News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/12/04/dems-resist-gop-counter-offer-to-avert-fiscal-crisis/,"Dems resist GOP counter-offer to avert fiscal crisis, as Pelosi tries to force vote on tax bill",2012-12-04,,"Democratic leaders are giving the cold shoulder to Republicans ' counter-offer in fiscal crisis talks -- and perhaps nothing captures the ongoing wheel-spinning more than House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi 's procedural move Tuesday afternoon .
Amid the deepening stalemate on the Hill over how to avert a wave of tax hikes and spending cuts starting next month , Pelosi pushed Tuesday for a vote on the Senate-passed bill that would extend current tax rates for middle-class families while letting rates rise for the top 2 percent . Republicans , who want to preserve the rates for everybody , have opposed this -- and Pelosi 's effort is unlikely to succeed for several reasons .
First , she would need to find 218 votes , including 27 Republican votes . And even if she is somehow able to muster that bipartisan support , congressional rules could delay a vote until next year -- by which point the shelf life on the procedural maneuver Pelosi is trying to employ would have expired .
The activity on the House side Tuesday underscores how little progress is being made toward a deal . Meanwhile , both the Obama administration and House Republicans have put a plan on the table , but each side is rejecting the other 's .
House Republican leaders unveiled a plan Monday that would agree to $ 800 billion in `` revenue through tax reform '' over the next 10 years . It marked a significant step for House Republicans , some of whom opposed such increased revenue before last month 's election .
However , the number is half the $ 1.6 trillion in tax hikes that Obama proposed . And the two sides are likely to continue to butt heads over the issue of an increase in tax rates for the top 2 percent of earners .
The White House has insisted on raising those rates next year , while Republicans favor raising revenue instead by closing deductions for top earners and other measures . They reiterated their opposition to tax-rate hikes in the plan Monday .
`` The ( proposal ) does not meet the test of balance , '' Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer said . `` In fact , it actually promises to lower rates for the wealthy and sticks the middle class with the bill . ... While the president is willing to compromise to get a significant , balanced deal and believes that compromise is readily available to Congress , he is not willing to compromise on the principles of fairness and balance . ''
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid chimed in , saying `` it is time for ( Republicans ) to get serious about forging a balanced approach . ''
In a letter to Obama on Monday , Republicans said they `` can not in good conscience agree '' to the president 's proposal , which was unveiled last week by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , calling it `` neither balanced nor realistic . ''
`` Regrettably , the proposal he outlined on behalf of your administration contains very little in the way of common ground , '' they wrote , particularly assailing the administration 's push for more stimulus spending at a time when Washington is supposed to be trimming the deficit .
The Republican counter-offer includes $ 800 billion in revenue through tax reform ; $ 600 billion in health savings ; $ 300 billion in other entitlement savings ; and another $ 300 billion in savings elsewhere in the discretionary federal budget . The plan would hike the Medicare eligibility age and lower cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security .
Republicans estimate the plan would save $ 2.2 trillion over 10 years -- or $ 4.6 trillion if one uses the accounting methods employed by the White House . Those methods boosted the White House estimate for its own plan to $ 4 trillion , but Republicans say the methods are spurious .
In the letter signed by House Speaker John Boehner and other Republican leaders , the lawmakers called the plan an `` imperfect , but fair middle ground . ''
`` If you are agreeable to this framework , we are ready and eager to begin discussions about how to structure these reforms so that the American people can be confident that these targets will be reached , '' they wrote .

And , in what one House Republican source called a `` pipe dream , '' the administration called for effectively implementing a permanent increase in the debt limit .","Democratic leaders are giving the cold shoulder to Republicans' counter-offer in fiscal crisis talks -- and perhaps nothing captures the ongoing wheel-spinning more than House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's procedural move Tuesday afternoon.

Amid the deepening stalemate on the Hill over how to avert a wave of tax hikes and spending cuts starting next month, Pelosi pushed Tuesday for a vote on the Senate-passed bill that would extend current tax rates for middle-class families while letting rates rise for the top 2 percent. Republicans, who want to preserve the rates for everybody, have opposed this -- and Pelosi's effort is unlikely to succeed for several reasons.

First, she would need to find 218 votes, including 27 Republican votes. And even if she is somehow able to muster that bipartisan support, congressional rules could delay a vote until next year -- by which point the shelf life on the procedural maneuver Pelosi is trying to employ would have expired.

The activity on the House side Tuesday underscores how little progress is being made toward a deal. Meanwhile, both the Obama administration and House Republicans have put a plan on the table, but each side is rejecting the other's.

House Republican leaders unveiled a plan Monday that would agree to $800 billion in ""revenue through tax reform"" over the next 10 years. It marked a significant step for House Republicans, some of whom opposed such increased revenue before last month's election.

However, the number is half the $1.6 trillion in tax hikes that Obama proposed. And the two sides are likely to continue to butt heads over the issue of an increase in tax rates for the top 2 percent of earners.

The White House has insisted on raising those rates next year, while Republicans favor raising revenue instead by closing deductions for top earners and other measures. They reiterated their opposition to tax-rate hikes in the plan Monday.

The White House almost immediately criticized the Republicans' offer.

""The (proposal) does not meet the test of balance,"" Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer said. ""In fact, it actually promises to lower rates for the wealthy and sticks the middle class with the bill. ... While the president is willing to compromise to get a significant, balanced deal and believes that compromise is readily available to Congress, he is not willing to compromise on the principles of fairness and balance.""

Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid chimed in, saying ""it is time for (Republicans) to get serious about forging a balanced approach.""

Republicans have the same to say about Obama's plan.

In a letter to Obama on Monday, Republicans said they ""cannot in good conscience agree"" to the president's proposal, which was unveiled last week by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, calling it ""neither balanced nor realistic.""

""Regrettably, the proposal he outlined on behalf of your administration contains very little in the way of common ground,"" they wrote, particularly assailing the administration's push for more stimulus spending at a time when Washington is supposed to be trimming the deficit.

The Republican counter-offer includes $800 billion in revenue through tax reform; $600 billion in health savings; $300 billion in other entitlement savings; and another $300 billion in savings elsewhere in the discretionary federal budget. The plan would hike the Medicare eligibility age and lower cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security.

Republicans estimate the plan would save $2.2 trillion over 10 years -- or $4.6 trillion if one uses the accounting methods employed by the White House. Those methods boosted the White House estimate for its own plan to $4 trillion, but Republicans say the methods are spurious.

In the letter signed by House Speaker John Boehner and other Republican leaders, the lawmakers called the plan an ""imperfect, but fair middle ground.""

""If you are agreeable to this framework, we are ready and eager to begin discussions about how to structure these reforms so that the American people can be confident that these targets will be reached,"" they wrote.

Republicans were fuming last week over the president's call for $1.6 trillion in tax hikes -- four times the value of his proposed spending cuts. Boehner said he was ""flabbergasted"" by the plan.

The administration's latest proposal includes roughly $600 billion in spending cuts. Those cuts, however, would be offset by $200 billion in proposed stimulus and other spending programs. The multi-year stimulus program would include at least $50 billion in fiscal 2013 alone; the administration also wants an extension of unemployment aid.

Americans are in a panic. Crowds throng gun shows and shops. Blue-chip companies fast-forward 2013’s dividends to 2012. Investors cash out profits, estate planners report a rush of people trying to beat higher inheritance taxes and lobbyists line up for favors.

What these people share is the goal of avoiding or benefitting from government actions. More than ever, the “invisible hand” of free markets is being replaced by the visible hand of bureaucrats. The political class is the new master of the universe.

If this were being staged in a theater, the national epidemic of expectation would be called “Waiting for Government.” It would be as absurd as “Waiting for Godot,” but not at all meaningless.

[pullquote]

That’s because the tax-and-spending drama in Washington, as pathetic and infuriating as it is, threatens real-world consequences for every American. How could it be otherwise when Big Government is getting bigger?

Much, much bigger.

The frantic run-up to the fiscal cliff, including wild swings in the stock market, provided an ominous snapshot of the new reality. Barack Obama’s reelection was the big story of 2012, but the real impact of his statist policies will be felt in the new year and for many years to come.

Obama’s victory secures first-term government expansions, such as ObamaCare, which carries expensive mandates and who knows how many unintended consequences. No matter how the fiscal talks are resolved, the IRS will be taking a fatter share of the fruits of national labor. At stake is how much fatter, whose ox gets gored and whose gets spared.

Some statistics, such as housing prices, say the economy is growing, but it’s all relative. The unemployment rate is falling largely because millions have stopped looking for work. Ordinary wages are stagnant or falling.

But it is boom time for the government. Spending continues to rise, hiring is up and the Federal Reserve’s printing presses are running overtime.

The Obama administration is happy to keep borrowing 40 cents of every dollar it spends, or nearly $4 billion a day, seven days a week. Each day brings plans for added regulations and new ways to rob Peter to pay Paul.

The combination creates a huge cloud hanging over every family and business. Debts and inflation exact penalties, perhaps for generations, and already are stifling innovation and job creation. Ours has become the world’s largest debtor nation and still needs more lenders.

The certain result will be an economic pie that doesn’t grow fast enough, which will lead to new demands for more redistribution under the guise of “fairness.” Always, the government redistributes by taking the first bite for itself.

The most disheartening aspect of this gloomy vision is that Americans voted for it. Obama was upfront about wanting to raise taxes and expand government and the debt. The reach and cost of Washington grew dramatically in the last four years, and he was rewarded with four more.

It is naive to think he will change course. His rejection of any serious reforms of entitlements shows that he is emboldened. Woe to the man who dares declare that the government already is too big and powerful. He will be denounced as cruel and caricatured as wanting no government at all.

This being the season for predictions, mine is that millions upon millions of Americans who voted for Obama will be disappointed in 2013. But most will not blame him. They will agree with him that the solution is to double the dose of Washington power.

Never mind that the patient is dying. The Obama operation is a great success. Just ask him.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nev. , said the deal -- brokered by Vice President Joe Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell -- would get a vote in the Senate sometime after midnight . The House would not vote before Tuesday afternoon at the earliest , sources said .
`` I feel really very , very good about this vote , '' Biden told reporters leaving the meeting with Senate Democrats , `` but having been in the Senate for as long as I have there 's two things you should n't do : You should n't predict how the Senate is going to vote before they vote .... [ and ] you surely should n't predict about how the House is going to vote . ''
The proposal would extend Bush-era tax cuts permanently for people making less than $ 400,000 per year and households making less than $ 450,000 , the sources said .
The steep `` sequester '' budget cuts scheduled to go into effect with the New Year would be postponed two months , said sources . They said half the money would come from cuts elsewhere , and the other half from new revenue .
The deal also would affect taxes on investment income and estates , and extend unemployment benefits for a year , the congressional sources added .
`` The end is in sight , '' said a Democratic aide with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid 's office . `` If everyone cooperates , it 's possible things can move pretty quickly . ''
After the Biden meeting , Sen. Charles Schumer , D-N.Y. , said there was `` strong '' support for the plan among Senate Democrats .
`` There is a feeling that it 's not that this proposal is regarded as great or as loved in any way , but it 's a lot better than going off the cliff , '' he said .
Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D-Calif. , called the compromise the `` best '' that could be done .
Even with progress in the Senate tonight , the `` cliff '' deadline will pass without action by the House , where Republican leaders said they would `` consider '' the deal starting tomorrow .
`` Decisions about whether the House will seek to accept or promptly amend the measure will not be made until House members -- and the American people -- have been able to review the legislation , '' said House Speaker John Boehner , Majority Leader Eric Cantor , Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy , and Republican Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers in a statement .
The failure of a deal to pass Congress by Jan. 1 technically triggers an income tax hike on all Americans and automatic spending cuts , though lawmakers could still prevent a tax hike by making retroactive any legislation that passes in the weeks ahead , experts said .
The deal at hand will not entirely solve the problem of the `` fiscal cliff , '' however . In fact , it could set up a new showdown over the same spending cuts in just two months that would be amplified by a brewing fight over how to raise the debt ceiling beyond $ 16.4 trillion . That new fiscal battle has the potential to eclipse the `` fiscal cliff '' in short order .
Earlier , during a midday news conference , Obama said he was optimistic about compromise in the short-term .
`` It appears that an agreement to prevent this New Year 's tax hike is within sight , but it 's not done , '' he said . `` There are still issues left to resolve , but we 're hopeful that Congress can get it done . ''
In addition to extending current tax rates for households making $ 450,000 or less , the latest plan would raise the estate tax from 35 to 40 percent for estates larger than $ 5 million ; and prevent the alternative minimum tax from hammering millions of middle-class workers , according to sources familiar with the talks .
Capital gains taxes would rise to 20 percent from 15 , according to a senior White House official .
The deal would also extend for one year unemployment insurance benefits set to expire Tuesday , and avert a steep cut to Medicare payments for doctors , congressional sources said .
`` I can report that we 've reached an agreement on the all the tax issues , '' said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in an afternoon speech on the Senate floor .
At the time , McConnell said that federal spending cuts remained a sticking point . That hurdle later appeared to be cleared by postponing the debate two more months , though it is unclear whether House Republicans will go along .
`` In order to get the sequester moved , you 're going to have to have real , concrete spending cuts , '' said Rep. Mike Rogers , R-Mich . Without that , he said , `` I do n't know how it passes the House . ''
Some Republicans also said Obama unduly complicated progress toward an agreement by seeming to take a victory lap on taxes at his campaign-style event at the White House .
`` Keep in mind that just last month Republicans in Congress said they would never agree to raise tax rates on the wealthiest Americans , '' Obama said , raising the ire of several Republicans . `` Obviously , the agreement that 's currently discussed would raise those rates , and raise them permanently . ''
Those words drew a sharp retort from Republican Sen. John McCain .
Rather than staging a `` cheerleading rally , '' McCain said , the president should have been negotiating the finishing touches of the deal .
`` He comes out and calls people together and has a group standing behind him , laughs and jokes and ridicules Republicans . Why ? '' said McCain .
Several Democrats also voiced disappointment with the president and the emerging deal .
`` This is one Democrat that does n't agree with that at all , '' Iowa Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin said of the tentative deal . `` No deal is better than a bad deal , and this looks like a very bad deal , the way this is shaping up . ''
Failure of Congress to act on a tax measure would trigger income tax hikes on all Americans . The average family would pay an extra $ 3,446 in 2013 under the higher rates , according to the Tax Policy Center .

In comments Republicans on Capitol Hill are highlighting , Mr. Obama argued in the summer of 2011 that the government could raise more than $ 1 trillion in revenue without increasing tax rates paid by the rich — something the president now contends is mathematically impossible .
“ What we said was , give us $ 1.2 trillion in additional revenues , which could be accomplished without hiking taxes — tax rates — but could simply be accomplished by eliminating loopholes , eliminating some deductions and engaging in a tax-reform process that could have lowered rates generally while broadening the base , ” the president said at a July 22 , 2011 , White House news conference .

“ It ’ s not me being stubborn . It ’ s not me being partisan . It ’ s just a matter of math , ” Mr. Obama said this week in an interview with Bloomberg .
During remarks to corporate CEOs at the Business Roundtable on Wednesday , Mr. Obama called on the leaders to urge Republicans to accept the tax-rate increases and not to use the debt ceiling to gain leverage for more entitlement cuts in the fiscal-cliff negotiations .

“ There ’ s no prospect in an agreement that doesn ’ t involve those rates going up on the top 2 percent of the wealthiest Americans , ” Mr. Geithner , one of the White House ’ s lead negotiators in the talks , told CNBC in an interview .

Mr. Obama didn ’ t lay out the specifics of his 2011 plan at the time — exactly which deductions and loopholes he would target to produce the revenue . He is now criticizing Republicans for failing to lay out the details of their plan .
But in making his offer to Mr. Obama this week , Mr. Boehner cited a nine-page report by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget , a nonpartisan , business-backed group that provided three options for finding the necessary revenue by limiting deductions without increasing tax rates .
White House officials said Republicans are not telling the full story about Mr. Obama ’ s 2011 quote . The president ’ s comment , they said , was part of an agreement with Republicans to spend the next year overhauling the tax code to find additional revenue , and if Washington couldn ’ t get all the complex tax changes through Congress by the end of 2012 , tax rates on the top 2 percent of Americans would go up .
Jason Furman , deputy director of the National Economic Council and an assistant to the president for economic policy , also said the White House has “ done a lot of work ” in the past year in crunching numbers and now “ knows more about tax reform ” than it did in 2011 .

Placing the limit on households making more than $ 250,000 would generate only $ 800 billion , Mr. Furman said , and would create an immense “ cliff , ” in which someone whose income rose to $ 251,000 could suddenly owe thousands of dollars more in taxes .","While he now demands that higher tax rates for the wealthy must be part of a “fiscal cliff” deal, President Obama took a very different line just over a year ago in the last major clash with Congress over a long-term budget deal.

House Speaker Boehner concedes on higher tax rates , debt limit
President Barack Obama responded on Monday to House Speaker John Boehner 's offer to compromise on tax rate increases with his own compromise on both tax increases and spending cuts , according to a source familiar with the discussions .
Obama 's latest offer brings the two sides billions of dollars closer to a deal to avert the fiscal cliff , which promises tax increases on income of all levels and across-the-board spending cuts in the new year .
For the first time , Boehner this weekend had offered to accept tax rate increases on household income over $ 1 million , sources said . Obama , who had stood steadfast at the threshold of $ 250,000 , on Monday offered Boehner a package which would raise rates on household income above $ 400,000 .
The president also offered ground on cuts to discretionary federal government spending . His initial offers had included no cuts ; his latest offer cuts of $ 200 billion , divided evenly between defense and non-defense programs .
The two men met face to face at the White House on Monday for 45 minutes , their third such meeting in eight days , a sign of an acceleration in the fiscal cliff negotiations .
Neither side favors returning income tax rates to 1990s levels on all income .
Hours before news of the president 's latest offer emerged , White House spokesman Jay Carney made it clear that more work needed to be done . `` The president 's proposal is the only proposal that we have seen that achieves the balance that is so necessary '' between revenue and cost-cutting , said Carney , who refused to discuss specifics .
Congress had been scheduled to end its work last week , but legislators returned to Washington on Monday and leaders warned members to be prepared to stay until Christmas and return after the holiday until year-end .
`` It appears at this stage -- we 'll see if anything changes -- but it appears we 're going to be coming back the day after Christmas to complete work on the fiscal cliff , '' Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nevada , said Monday . Last week , U.S. Rep. Chris Van Hollen , D-Maryland , said a deal would have to be reached by Christmas to allow time for the legislative process to approve the required measure or measures by the end of the year .
The source told CNN that Obama 's latest offer includes $ 1.2 trillion in revenue increases on individual income and $ 1.22 trillion in spending reductions , though Boehner 's office said the math adds up differently .
`` Any movement away from the unrealistic offers the president has made previously is a step in the right direction , but a proposal that includes $ 1.3 trillion in revenue for only $ 930 billion in spending cuts can not be considered balanced , '' Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said . `` We hope to continue discussions with the president so we can reach an agreement that is truly balanced and begins to solve our spending problem . ''
A senior GOP House aide posited that one difference in the math is the way the White House and Republicans are handling the consumer price index , which takes into account changes in the quantity and prices of products .
Republican aides estimate that the CPI would increase tax revenues by an additional $ 95 billion over Obama 's estimated $ 1.2 trillion , putting the number closer to $ 1.3 trillion .
They also do not count Obama 's estimated $ 290 billion in savings on national debt interest accumulation because they do not consider these savings real cuts .
Obama 's plan , Republican aides said , does not include a 1-1 ratio of spending cuts and revenue .
Obama 's proposal includes $ 130 billion in spending savings due to changes in the CPI . It is applied to many entitlement benefits , such as Social Security , to protect participants against rising prices . The chained CPI includes assumptions on consumer habits with regard to rising prices , such as seeking cheaper alternatives , and would result in smaller benefit increases in future years .
Labor unions and advocacy groups for the elderly are expected to oppose it .
Boehner has been under pressure from the White House , Democrats , the business community and some fellow Republicans to give up the staunch opposition to any increase in tax rates .

House Speaker Boehner concedes on higher tax rates, debt limit

Boehner and Obama meet for 45 minutes on Monday

President Barack Obama responded on Monday to House Speaker John Boehner's offer to compromise on tax rate increases with his own compromise on both tax increases and spending cuts, according to a source familiar with the discussions.

Obama's latest offer brings the two sides billions of dollars closer to a deal to avert the fiscal cliff, which promises tax increases on income of all levels and across-the-board spending cuts in the new year.

For the first time, Boehner this weekend had offered to accept tax rate increases on household income over $1 million, sources said. Obama, who had stood steadfast at the threshold of $250,000, on Monday offered Boehner a package which would raise rates on household income above $400,000.

The president also offered ground on cuts to discretionary federal government spending. His initial offers had included no cuts; his latest offer cuts of $200 billion, divided evenly between defense and non-defense programs.

The two men met face to face at the White House on Monday for 45 minutes, their third such meeting in eight days, a sign of an acceleration in the fiscal cliff negotiations.

Neither side favors returning income tax rates to 1990s levels on all income.

Hours before news of the president's latest offer emerged, White House spokesman Jay Carney made it clear that more work needed to be done. ""The president's proposal is the only proposal that we have seen that achieves the balance that is so necessary"" between revenue and cost-cutting, said Carney, who refused to discuss specifics.

Congress had been scheduled to end its work last week, but legislators returned to Washington on Monday and leaders warned members to be prepared to stay until Christmas and return after the holiday until year-end.

""It appears at this stage -- we'll see if anything changes -- but it appears we're going to be coming back the day after Christmas to complete work on the fiscal cliff,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said Monday. Last week, U.S. Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said a deal would have to be reached by Christmas to allow time for the legislative process to approve the required measure or measures by the end of the year.

The source told CNN that Obama's latest offer includes $1.2 trillion in revenue increases on individual income and $1.22 trillion in spending reductions, though Boehner's office said the math adds up differently.

""Any movement away from the unrealistic offers the president has made previously is a step in the right direction, but a proposal that includes $1.3 trillion in revenue for only $930 billion in spending cuts cannot be considered balanced,"" Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said. ""We hope to continue discussions with the president so we can reach an agreement that is truly balanced and begins to solve our spending problem.""

A senior GOP House aide posited that one difference in the math is the way the White House and Republicans are handling the consumer price index, which takes into account changes in the quantity and prices of products.

Republican aides estimate that the CPI would increase tax revenues by an additional $95 billion over Obama's estimated $1.2 trillion, putting the number closer to $1.3 trillion.

They also do not count Obama's estimated $290 billion in savings on national debt interest accumulation because they do not consider these savings real cuts.

Obama's plan, Republican aides said, does not include a 1-1 ratio of spending cuts and revenue.

Obama's proposal includes $130 billion in spending savings due to changes in the CPI. It is applied to many entitlement benefits, such as Social Security, to protect participants against rising prices. The chained CPI includes assumptions on consumer habits with regard to rising prices, such as seeking cheaper alternatives, and would result in smaller benefit increases in future years.

Labor unions and advocacy groups for the elderly are expected to oppose it.

Boehner has been under pressure from the White House, Democrats, the business community and some fellow Republicans to give up the staunch opposition to any increase in tax rates.

Conservatives trying to shrink the federal government generally oppose increasing tax revenue. They are particularly opposed to higher tax rates because history shows that once rates go up, it is difficult to later reduce government revenue by lowering them again.

Obama and Democrats argue that increased revenue, including higher tax rates on the wealthy, must be part of broader deficit reduction to prevent the middle class from getting hit too hard.

The president's plan also includes one of his key demands on the national debt, a two-year extension of the debt ceiling being subject to periodic congressional votes under the so-called McConnell mechanism. That allows the president to notify congress of a debt-ceiling increase. Congress could then take no action and let it go into effect or vote to deny the increase. Without that mechanism, Congress would have to approve all debt-ceiling increases.

It remains unclear if a deal will happen before the end of the year -- less than four weeks away -- or if the negotiations will carry over into 2013 after the fiscal cliff of automatic tax hikes and spending cuts takes effect .
While economists warn that going over the fiscal cliff could lead to a recession , the administration has signaled it can delay some of the impacts to allow time to work out a deal .
All signs point toward a two-step approach sought by the newly re-elected Obama -- an initial agreement that would extend lower tax rates for income up to $ 250,000 for families , while letting rates return to higher levels from the Clinton era on income above that threshold .
Even conservatives such as Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn and Louisiana Gov . Bobby Jindal acknowledge the obvious -- taxes on the wealthy are going up despite opposition by Republicans .
`` Whatever deal is reached is going to contain elements that are detrimental to our economy , '' Jindal wrote Thursday in an opinion piece published by Politico . `` Elections have consequences , and the country is going to feel those consequences soon . ''
At the same time , Jindal wrote , `` Republicans certainly should fight to at least get something done that will matter . ''
`` At present , any reading of the headlines over the past week indicates that Republicans are fighting to protect the rich and cut benefits for seniors , '' he added . `` It may be possible to have worse political positioning than that , but I 'm not sure how . ''
Coburn , a notorious fiscal hawk , told MSNBC on Wednesday that he would support higher tax rates on wealthier Americans as part of a broader deal to avoid the fiscal cliff and broader deficit crisis .
`` I know we have to raise revenue , '' Coburn said . `` I do n't really care which way we do it . Actually , I would rather see rates go up than do it the other way , because it gives us a greater chance to reform the tax code and broaden the base in the future . ''
After meeting with his conference Wednesday , Boehner told reporters that the rich will be paying more , but he still hoped to limit any increase to ending tax deductions and loopholes rather than Obama 's demand for higher rates .
`` We have got to cut spending and I believe it is appropriate to put revenues on the table , '' Boehner said . `` Now , the revenues that we are putting on the table are going to come from guess who ? The rich . ''
He continued , `` There are ways to limit deductions , close loopholes and have the same people pay more of their money to the federal government without raising tax rates , which we believe will harm our economy . ''
Obama , however , continued to insist that Republicans must agree to higher tax rates for the wealthiest Americans before working out a broader agreement on tackling the nation 's chronic federal deficits and debt .
Under his plan , 98 % of the country would have current rates extended , with higher rates affecting only 2 % of top earners , the president and Democrats note .
`` I 'm not going to sign any package that somehow prevents the tax rate from going up for folks in the top 2 % , '' Obama said Thursday at a campaign-style visit with a Virginia family to discuss the tax issue .
The statements reflected how negotiations on the the fiscal cliff have evolved since last month 's election , when Obama won a second term and Democrats made gains in both chambers of Congress .
Republicans opposed to any new revenue in their quest to shrink government now realize Obama 's victory and public support for the president 's campaign theme of higher taxes on the wealthy leave them with little negotiating leverage .
A new poll Thursday was the third in recent days to indicate most Americans accepted raising taxes on incomes over $ 250,000 as part of a fiscal cliff deal .
The Quinnipiac University national survey showed 65 % of registered voters support higher taxes on the wealthy , though Republican respondents were opposed,53 % to 41 % .
Also , a Washington Post/Pew Research Center survey released Tuesday showed 53 % of respondents would blame Republicans for failure to reach a deal , compared with 27 % who would blame Obama . A CNN/ORC International poll released last week showed 45 % would blame congressional Republicans compared with 34 % who would hold Obama responsible .
Despite the public stance softening of some Republicans in each house , signs point to a continuing standoff for now .
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell warned Thursday that his party will continue to use the federal debt-ceiling issue as leverage to extract concessions on spending cuts from Democrats , a tactic that Obama opposes .
`` The only way we ever cut spending around here is by using the debate over the debt limit to do it , '' McConnell said in response to Obama 's call for removing the issue from political negotiation .
At the White House , spokesman Jay Carney said such brinksmanship over a matter involving a possible unprecedented government default was opposed by the business community and the American public .
`` I ca n't imagine they would want to do that , '' he said of Republicans .
The House is scheduled to adjourn for the year on December 14 , but Boehner 's number two , Majority Leader Eric Cantor , said Wednesday the chamber would remain in session until a fiscal cliff deal gets reached .
Boehner , meanwhile , challenged Obama to talk , saying , `` I 'll be here and I 'll be available at any moment to sit down with the president to get serious about solving this problem . ''
Obama demands that the House immediately pass a measure already approved by the Senate to extend tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 on income up to $ 250,000 for families .
He contends that both Democrats and Republicans agree that the 98 % of American families making less than $ 250,000 a year should avoid a tax hike when the lower rates from the Bush administration expire on December 31 . They call for the House to guarantee that outcome by passing the Senate measure now .
Once that happens , Obama and Democratic leaders promise , they will work out compromises on other spending cuts sought by Republicans to reduce the deficit , such as reforms to the Medicare and Medicaid entitlement programs .
The latest proposal from House Republicans could reduce federal deficits by $ 2.2 trillion over 10 years , GOP leaders say .
The GOP proposal includes $ 800 billion from tax reform , $ 600 billion from Medicare reforms and other health savings and $ 600 billion in other spending cuts , House Republican leadership aides said . It also pledges $ 200 billion in savings by revising the consumer price index , a measure of inflation .
While the Republicans gave ground by calling for more revenue through tax reform , the plan mentioned only unspecified elimination of some deductions and loopholes .
Obama 's broader deficit reduction plan calls for deficit reduction of about $ 500 billion over 10 years by limiting itemized tax deductions and other benefits for high-income earners . The 28 % limit on deductions would apply to families earning more than $ 250,000 and individuals making more than $ 200,000 , according to the White House .
Jason Furman , an assistant to Obama on economic policy , told reporters Wednesday that the president wants to ensure additional revenue from higher taxes on the wealthy now to help avoid the fiscal cliff .
`` What we 're seeking to do is to lock in revenue this year , not have some vague process that may or may not add up to something , you know , in the future , and so we 're trying to pass something this month , '' Furman said .
While the White House has made clear Obama will veto any measure that fails to increase tax rates on the wealthy , aides have signaled a possible willingness to negotiate the specific rate increase .
In an interview with Bloomberg TV this week , Obama said lower tax rates for the wealthy could be negotiated as part of broader tax reform in 2013 , but only after those rates increase now .
Obama 's deficit-reduction plan would increase taxes by almost $ 1 trillion over 10 years , a significant portion of a $ 4 trillion overall deficit-reduction goal .
It also would close loopholes , limit deductions , raise the estate tax rate to 2009 levels and increases tax rates on capital gains and dividends .
The Obama plan includes $ 50 billion in stimulus spending for programs intended to create jobs , such as repairing roads and bridges .
Experts have said failing to reach a fiscal cliff deal and devise a framework for a broader deficit reduction package to be negotiated when the new Congress is seated in January would cause economic turmoil .
The non-partisan Tax Policy Center estimates that middle-class families would pay about $ 2,000 a year more in taxes without action .","Story highlights A source says talks resume between staff members on both sides

Republicans say that it wouldn ’ t be default , but just a budget crisis . The government borrows about 40 percent of what it spends . Once the cap was reached , spending would have to go down 40 percent until a deal could be made to lift the limit again .
That would mean huge disruptions and giant economic catastrophe and a panic among those lending money to the government . A very bad scene , indeed . And Obama ’ s best pressure point in a debt-limit standoff is to make the moment as dramatic and awful as possible – shutting down the government , etc . -- in order to increase public pressure on Republicans . Then the president would find himself needing to make the economy worse to get more borrowing authority .
But if Republicans can rationalize their way to extending current tax rates for the 98 percent of the 54 percent of households that pay income taxes before the end of the year , they would be at least fighting on their turf : debt , deficits and spending .
The rationalization could either be that they ’ re technically not voting for any taxes to go up , or however else they use legalistic definitions to comply with promises made on refusing to increase taxes .
However they get there , if Republicans can find a way to avoid spending January fighting over tax rates , they can spend February fighting over Obama ’ s request for more borrowing . That ’ s a better place for Republicans to be .
In that scenario , Obama could attempt to borrow money without congressional approval – an unattractive prospect to any lender but the Federal Reserve . That could trigger huge interest rate hikes , triggering a fresh recession .
And meantime , the cuts that were part of the last debt ceiling deal would be whacking away at the domestic programs Democrats love and believe are the key to reviving the economy . Deep defense cuts would be underway , causing cutbacks at big contractors who employ hundreds of thousands of Americans .
Team Obama says they can delay implementation of the cuts , but whatever they can finagle , it promises to be a very lousy first quarter of 2013 if there is no deal on the cuts and a battle over the debt ceiling looms .
How long could Obama hold the line on his demand for an unconditional increase if the economy was crashing down around his ears ? Republicans would be under huge pressure to relent , but it ’ s hard to imagine a sitting president refusing to do a deal with the economy grinding to a halt .
Republicans want a larger deal to address the cuts and taxes and borrowing limits and entitlements . Obama wants to go piecemeal – first the tax hikes , then the spending , then the entitlements , and so on . He ’ d also like Republicans to unilaterally disarm on borrowing .
If Republicans retain control over the debt and then take Obama up on his offer to go one step at a time , they may actually find that they are on the high ground next month .
It ’ s an ugly , awful way to do it , but unless the president decides he ’ s ready to do a deal , Republicans may have no other choice .

-- President Obama talking to the CEO members of The Business Roundtable about the possibility that Congress might not grant him an unconditional increase to the debt limit.

President Obama will be campaigning in Northern Virginia today, explaining to voters, er, constituents that it is essential that Republicans vote to extend current tax rates for middle-class families.

But what if they did?

House GOP members are warming up to the idea of what in military terms might be called “strategic withdrawal” – a retreat to more favorable terrain.

The president has Republicans pretty well pinned down on the issue of federal income tax rates. The GOP can’t get an across-the-board extension of current tax rates through the Democratic Senate, and even if they could, Obama has vowed to veto any plan that doesn’t include a rate hike on top earners.

And if Republicans block a proposal that would prevent the tax rate hike for the vast majority of taxpayers in the name of protecting rates for top earners, rates will go up for all of the 53.6 percent of American households that pay federal income taxes.

On the other side of that rate hike, Republicans will have to fight for every cent of tax reduction and Obama would be in the enviable position of being the grantor of lower rates rather than the extender of existing rates.

This is perhaps why Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, Obama’s chief negotiator on taxes, sounded positively plumy about the prospect of going over the tax cliff when talking to the folks at CNBC. “Absolutely,” Geithner said when asked about taking a tumble.

The cliff, as mainly understood, is a double whammy of automatic tax hikes and gradual spending cuts. Team Obama believes that it can hold off, for a time, the hikes and cuts while negotiations continue with Republicans. Those negotiations, though, would be taking place in a world of higher tax rates, limiting Republican leverage.

Unless…

The government has nearly run through the $2.2 trillion in additional borrowing power granted to Obama under the terms of the August deal that created the mechanism that is now set to begin making automatic cuts, the spending side of the cliff.

Republicans hate, hate raising the debt limit. Democrats, including Obama, didn’t much like it when George W. Bush was president either, but for the GOP, which has become consumed by the idea of spending cuts and debt reduction, raising the limit is anathema.

This sets up a moment early next year in which Republicans can make demands of the president in exchange for a lift in the borrowing limit.

Obama would like Congress to pass a law that says lawmakers would no longer need to approve credit limit increases, but rather could vote to block them if they so choose – shifting the power on borrowing from the legislative branch to the executive branch.

This will, of course, not happen. But it represents the alternative vision that Obama will be offering in February when he is calling GOPers hostage takers who are forcing a government default.

Republicans say that it wouldn’t be default, but just a budget crisis. The government borrows about 40 percent of what it spends. Once the cap was reached, spending would have to go down 40 percent until a deal could be made to lift the limit again.

That would mean huge disruptions and giant economic catastrophe and a panic among those lending money to the government. A very bad scene, indeed. And Obama’s best pressure point in a debt-limit standoff is to make the moment as dramatic and awful as possible – shutting down the government, etc. -- in order to increase public pressure on Republicans. Then the president would find himself needing to make the economy worse to get more borrowing authority.

But if Republicans can rationalize their way to extending current tax rates for the 98 percent of the 54 percent of households that pay income taxes before the end of the year, they would be at least fighting on their turf: debt, deficits and spending.

The rationalization could either be that they’re technically not voting for any taxes to go up, or however else they use legalistic definitions to comply with promises made on refusing to increase taxes.

However they get there, if Republicans can find a way to avoid spending January fighting over tax rates, they can spend February fighting over Obama’s request for more borrowing. That’s a better place for Republicans to be.

In that scenario, Obama could attempt to borrow money without congressional approval – an unattractive prospect to any lender but the Federal Reserve. That could trigger huge interest rate hikes, triggering a fresh recession.

And meantime, the cuts that were part of the last debt ceiling deal would be whacking away at the domestic programs Democrats love and believe are the key to reviving the economy. Deep defense cuts would be underway, causing cutbacks at big contractors who employ hundreds of thousands of Americans.

Team Obama says they can delay implementation of the cuts, but whatever they can finagle, it promises to be a very lousy first quarter of 2013 if there is no deal on the cuts and a battle over the debt ceiling looms.

How long could Obama hold the line on his demand for an unconditional increase if the economy was crashing down around his ears? Republicans would be under huge pressure to relent, but it’s hard to imagine a sitting president refusing to do a deal with the economy grinding to a halt.

Republicans want a larger deal to address the cuts and taxes and borrowing limits and entitlements. Obama wants to go piecemeal – first the tax hikes, then the spending, then the entitlements, and so on. He’d also like Republicans to unilaterally disarm on borrowing.

If Republicans retain control over the debt and then take Obama up on his offer to go one step at a time, they may actually find that they are on the high ground next month.

It’s an ugly, awful way to do it, but unless the president decides he’s ready to do a deal, Republicans may have no other choice.

And Now, A Word From Charles

STEPHEN F. HAYES: And I think you are looking once again at a media that is eager to blame Republicans for this.



CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER: That's why I'm correcting them.



HAYES: You are correcting them?



BRET BAIER: We have an online show to talk more about this.



KRAUTHAMMER: I'll correct them even more.

Geithner pushed back Sunday at Republican attacks on the Obama administration ’ s proposal rolled out four days earlier to avoid falling off the “ fiscal cliff , ” saying if GOP leaders don ’ t like it , they should come up with a plan of their own .
But while Mr. Geithner says he is still optimistic a deal will be worked out before critical year-end deadlines , House Speaker John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican , said Sunday that talks with the administration are going nowhere and accused President Obama of trying to ram through the White House plan without negotiating in good faith .
Both sides say the other is digging in and playing partisan hardball at the expense of the fragile economy .
“ If they ’ ve got some different suggestions , [ if ] they want to go further in some areas , then they should lay it out to us , ” Mr. Geithner told “ Fox News Sunday. ” “ We are waiting to hear from them . ”
The administration on Thursday floated a budget framework to Republicans calling for $ 1.6 trillion in tax increases coupled with promised spending cuts of $ 400 billion . Mr. Geithner also said tax reforms in the president ’ s plan would raise $ 600 billion .
“ We laid out a very detailed , carefully designed set of spending , savings and tax changes that help put us back on a path to fiscal responsibility , ” he said .
Mr. Geithner said he is hopeful a deal can be brokered before hitting the early January fiscal cliff , when George W. Bush-era tax cuts expire and a series of defense and domestic spending cuts kick in — a scenario that would trigger a crippling recession , many economists say .
Mr. Obama and most Democrats want to extend the tax cuts only for individuals making less than $ 200,000 and couples earning less than $ 250,000 — about 98 percent of all taxpayers . Republicans want to continue the cuts for everyone .
Mr. Geithner said if negotiations fail , the blame will rest with a “ small group ” of Republicans in Congress who “ decide they ’ re going to block an agreement because they ’ re not prepared to see tax rates rise modestly for just 2 percent of the wealthiest Americans . ”
GOP leaders dismissed the president ’ s plan almost immediately last week , saying it doesn ’ t include enough spending cuts and raises taxes too much . Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , Kentucky Republican , reportedly laughed when shown the plan ’ s details last week , while Mr. Boehner said Sunday he was “ flabbergasted . ”
“ I looked at [ Mr. Geithner ] and said , ‘ You can ’ t be serious , ’ ” Mr. Boehner told “ Fox News Sunday. ” “ We ’ ve got seven weeks between Election Day and the end of the year . And three of those weeks have been wasted with this nonsense . ”
GOP leaders , including Mr. Boehner , have denied they don ’ t have a plan of their own , pointing to their postelection offer to allow the government to raise tax revenue through ending some deductions and closing loopholes — though they have held strong against raising tax rates . They say it ’ s now the Democrats ’ turn to bring more to the negotiating table — namely bigger cuts to major entitlements such as Medicare .
Mr. Boehner also chafed at a provision in the administration ’ s plan that calls for Congress to relinquish its power to raise the debt limit , calling that idea “ silliness . ”
The speaker said he still is willing to work with the president to hammer out a deal before the new year . He declined to offer specific details , though he said recent budget plans by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan , Wisconsin Republican , offer plenty of examples on how to lower the debt and deficit .
“ I don ’ t want any part of going over the cliff . I ’ m going to do everything I can to avert that , ” he said .
Sen. Lindsey Graham , South Carolina Republican , sounded even more pessimistic , predicting on CBS ’ “ Face the Nation ” on Sunday that “ I think we ’ re going over the cliff. ” He also called the president ’ s proposed entitlement reforms “ a joke . ”
“ The president ’ s plan does nothing but damn us to becoming Greece , ” Mr. Graham said of the European country facing a budget crisis and 25.4 percent unemployment .
Mr. Geithner said Republican leaders in Congress are “ in a very difficult place ” because they are struggling to win support for a plan from their members , many of whom are committed to taking a hard-line stance against the president .

`` Until the Republicans in Congress are willing to get serious about asking the wealthiest to pay slightly higher tax rates , we wo n't be able to achieve a significant , balanced approach to reduce our deficit , '' Pfeiffer said .
Republicans offered the plan amid pressure for a House vote -- which Boehner has so far prevented -- on a measure already approved by the Senate to extend tax cuts for families making less than $ 250,000 a year and to allow rates to return to Clinton-era levels for wealthier households . Lower tax rates set in 2001 and 2003 were extended for two years as part of budget talks in 2010 .
In line with his stances during his first term and re-election campaign , Obama 's deficit-reduction plan would increase tax revenue by almost $ 1 trillion over 10 years , a significant cut of a $ 4 trillion overall deficit reduction goal . In addition to adding a $ 50 billion stimulus package , his proposal closes loopholes , limits deductions , raises the estate tax rate to 2009 levels and increases tax rates on capital gains and dividends .
Yet Republicans , led by Boehner , have objected to any increase in tax rates , even for the wealthiest Americans . They have said an agreement must include major reforms of entitlement programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid government-run health-care programs for senior citizens , the disabled and the poor .
Their plan offered Monday proposed $ 800 billion in deficit savings through tax reform , including an unspecified amount of revenue raised by eliminating tax deductions and loopholes .
The GOP letter said the offer is based on a framework proposed last year by Erskine Bowles , a Democrat and one-time White House chief of staff who co-chaired a bipartisan deficit reduction panel appointed by Obama in 2010 .
`` This is by no means an adequate long-term solution , as resolving our long-term fiscal crisis will require fundamental entitlement reform , '' the letter said . `` Indeed , the Bowles plan is exactly the kind of imperfect , but fair middle ground that allows us to avert the fiscal cliff without hurting our economy and destroying jobs . ''
In his response , Pfeiffer said the Republican proposal `` includes nothing new and provides no details on which deductions they would eliminate , which loopholes they will close or which Medicare savings they would achieve . ''
`` Independent analysts who have looked at plans like this one have concluded that middle class taxes will have to go up to pay for lower rates for millionaires and billionaires , '' he said .
And Bowles denied any direct connection to the GOP proposal , saying it reflected his view of a middle-ground approach a year ago but `` circumstances have changed since then . ''
`` It is up to negotiators to figure out where the middle ground is today , '' Bowles said .
Recent posturing on both sides -- such as Boehner saying this weekend he was `` flabbergasted '' by Obama 's plan -- reflects mistrust built up over two years of deficit wars that have left Congress with a reputation for dysfunction .
In 2011 , Republicans demanded major budget cuts before they authorized a hike in the federal debt ceiling , a fight that contributed to a U.S. credit rating downgrade .
The end of that crisis was a temporary fix that set up the current crisis , which sets the stage for sharp and widespread tax increases and the start of budget cuts of $ 1 trillion over 10 years if there is no agreement .
Experts have said failing to reach a fiscal cliff deal and devise a framework for a broader deficit reduction package to be negotiated when the new Congress is seated in January will cause economic turmoil and threaten the U.S. credit rating . The non-partisan Tax Policy Center estimates that middle-class families would pay about $ 2,000 a year more in taxes without action .
According to a CNN/ORC International Poll released last week , 56 % of respondents said higher taxes were a fair tradeoff if it helps lower-income people , while 36 % said taxes should be kept low to create jobs .
Another survey , by ABC News and the Washington Post , showed two thirds of respondents support Obama 's call for holding down tax rates for everyone except the wealthiest Americans .
So what happens next ? Senior Obama administration officials said Monday the GOP 's plan was a nonstarter , primarily because they said it would actually lower tax rates for those in the top 2 % income bracket and was too short on specifics .
But even with no more offers officially in the works , both sides will keep talking , the officials said . That may happen as soon as Monday night , when all members of Congress are invited to a holiday reception at which they can talk to , among others , the president himself .","Story highlights House GOP leaders call for some revenue increases, more spending cuts

""Until the Republicans in Congress are willing to get serious about asking the wealthiest to pay slightly higher tax rates, we won't be able to achieve a significant, balanced approach to reduce our deficit,"" Pfeiffer said.

Republicans offered the plan amid pressure for a House vote -- which Boehner has so far prevented -- on a measure already approved by the Senate to extend tax cuts for families making less than $250,000 a year and to allow rates to return to Clinton-era levels for wealthier households. Lower tax rates set in 2001 and 2003 were extended for two years as part of budget talks in 2010.

In line with his stances during his first term and re-election campaign, Obama's deficit-reduction plan would increase tax revenue by almost $1 trillion over 10 years, a significant cut of a $4 trillion overall deficit reduction goal. In addition to adding a $50 billion stimulus package, his proposal closes loopholes, limits deductions, raises the estate tax rate to 2009 levels and increases tax rates on capital gains and dividends.

Yet Republicans, led by Boehner, have objected to any increase in tax rates, even for the wealthiest Americans. They have said an agreement must include major reforms of entitlement programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid government-run health-care programs for senior citizens, the disabled and the poor.

Their plan offered Monday proposed $800 billion in deficit savings through tax reform, including an unspecified amount of revenue raised by eliminating tax deductions and loopholes.

The GOP letter said the offer is based on a framework proposed last year by Erskine Bowles, a Democrat and one-time White House chief of staff who co-chaired a bipartisan deficit reduction panel appointed by Obama in 2010.

""This is by no means an adequate long-term solution, as resolving our long-term fiscal crisis will require fundamental entitlement reform,"" the letter said. ""Indeed, the Bowles plan is exactly the kind of imperfect, but fair middle ground that allows us to avert the fiscal cliff without hurting our economy and destroying jobs.""

In his response, Pfeiffer said the Republican proposal ""includes nothing new and provides no details on which deductions they would eliminate, which loopholes they will close or which Medicare savings they would achieve.""

""Independent analysts who have looked at plans like this one have concluded that middle class taxes will have to go up to pay for lower rates for millionaires and billionaires,"" he said.

And Bowles denied any direct connection to the GOP proposal, saying it reflected his view of a middle-ground approach a year ago but ""circumstances have changed since then.""

""It is up to negotiators to figure out where the middle ground is today,"" Bowles said.

Recent posturing on both sides -- such as Boehner saying this weekend he was ""flabbergasted"" by Obama's plan -- reflects mistrust built up over two years of deficit wars that have left Congress with a reputation for dysfunction.

In 2011, Republicans demanded major budget cuts before they authorized a hike in the federal debt ceiling, a fight that contributed to a U.S. credit rating downgrade.

The end of that crisis was a temporary fix that set up the current crisis, which sets the stage for sharp and widespread tax increases and the start of budget cuts of $1 trillion over 10 years if there is no agreement.

Experts have said failing to reach a fiscal cliff deal and devise a framework for a broader deficit reduction package to be negotiated when the new Congress is seated in January will cause economic turmoil and threaten the U.S. credit rating. The non-partisan Tax Policy Center estimates that middle-class families would pay about $2,000 a year more in taxes without action.

According to a CNN/ORC International Poll released last week, 56% of respondents said higher taxes were a fair tradeoff if it helps lower-income people, while 36% said taxes should be kept low to create jobs.

Another survey, by ABC News and the Washington Post, showed two thirds of respondents support Obama's call for holding down tax rates for everyone except the wealthiest Americans.

So what happens next? Senior Obama administration officials said Monday the GOP's plan was a nonstarter, primarily because they said it would actually lower tax rates for those in the top 2% income bracket and was too short on specifics.

But even with no more offers officially in the works, both sides will keep talking, the officials said. That may happen as soon as Monday night, when all members of Congress are invited to a holiday reception at which they can talk to, among others, the president himself.",www.cnn.com,left,ysMk3nsKkk0n2R1e

Obama and Boehner hit their lowest point yet during a day of sharp words and legislative confusion — and the outlook significantly darkened for reaching a deficit-reduction deal before the new year. The talks are stalled, and Boehner is scrambling to muscle his own bill through the House — a proposal the president has already promised to veto.

With 12 days to go until the deadline, the president faulted Boehner for wasting time on a bill that will never reach the Oval Office.

Boehner responded with a curt statement from the Capitol, where he told the president to “get serious soon,” or else Obama “can be responsible for the largest tax increase in American history.” Boehner then turned and walked out.

The dueling public statements signaled that little has fundamentally changed between Obama and Boehner, who have been here before. They got close to a grand bargain on the debt and deficit in 2011 only to see it crumble amid partisan pressures. Both felt burned.

On Wednesday, it looked like history had a good shot at repeating itself, as the tenuous progress they made over the past week seemed to unravel.

Obama, betraying some of those bruised feelings, said Republicans just need to “take the deal.”

“They keep on finding ways to say ‘no’ as opposed to finding ways to say ‘yes,’” Obama said. “And I don’t know how much of that just has to do with, you know, it is very hard for them to say yes to me. But, you know, at some point, you know, they’ve got to take me out of it and think about their voters and think about what’s best for the country.”

Boehner’s Plan B bill is going nowhere, Obama added.

But as all that 's happening for public consumption at the White House and Capitol Hill press studios , a tight circle of trusted aides float proposals on how much they might be willing to compromise inside conference rooms or over e-mail .
While those staff-level exchanges did stop for a week after aides on both sides said there was no one giving ground , they have now resumed after a phone call last week between Obama and Boehner .
Two former senior Capitol Hill insiders who worked on opposite sides of negotiations similar to the fiscal cliff talks agree that public posturing will continue for a while . They agree there wo n't be any major breakthroughs on a deal until both sides feel the pressure of the deadline and their backs are against the wall .
`` Nothing happens until it has to happen , '' said Jim Manley , former senior communications adviser for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and a longtime aide to former Sen. Ted Kennedy .
Ron Bonjean , a former spokesman for former House Speaker Dennis Hastert and aide to top Senate Republicans , noted that while the public may be focused on the dwindling deadline for a fiscal cliff deal , the year-end time frame is `` a lifetime in Congress . ''
Both Bonjean and Manley are veterans of a series of high-profile showdowns on government funding , comprehensive education legislation and tax cuts .
Inside the Capitol , major negotiations often coincide with the holidays at the end of the year . Staffers work long hours inside the building that Bonjean referred to as a `` biosphere . ''
`` Everybody 's Christmas shopping online , '' the GOP strategist said . `` Reporters are standing outside these rooms , waiting , staking out and waiting for something to happen . It 's like watching grass grow for hours . ''
But Manley emphasized that maneuvering the line between public statements and private meetings can be a delicate dance .
`` From my perspective , it was always important to try not to get too wrapped up in the angry rhetoric and the charges being lobbed by either side because in the end my goal was to protect Sen. Reid and make sure he 's in a position to get a deal done , '' Manley said .
Bonjean pointed out that Obama 's campaign-style events could complicate talks : `` It really ticks Republicans off and actually hardens their position . ''
But Democrats on Capitol Hill are applauding the president 's strategy to concentrate in this negotiation on the outside messaging after their frustration that in previous talks he spent too much time trying privately to get House Republicans to compromise .
`` The good news is that I think the president and his team finally came to the realization that they ca n't negotiate with hostage takers and that they 've learned their lessons from the debt limit debacle last year , '' Manley said . `` They 're prepared to take their case to the American people , which I think in this current atmosphere where the political process is largely broken , that that 's the only game in town . ''
In the two years since becoming speaker , Boehner has faced off with Reid and Obama on bills to avoid a government shutdown , raise the debt ceiling and renew tax cuts .
But Boehner previously had earned a reputation as a skilled negotiator as the chairman of the House Education Committee and worked across the aisle with Kennedy on the landmark No Child Left Behind education bill as well as pension reforms and disabilities legislation .
Manley worked for Kennedy then and observed Boehner up close . He pointed to those negotiations as instances when what was said outside the room did n't always match what was going on behind the scenes .
`` Both were smart , wily legislators who realized there 's a difference between what you say outside some times and what you agreed to when you actually begin negotiating . ''
But there are points inevitably when the talks break down , and in many cases deals fall apart multiple times before they get revived .
Quietly , a leader of one party may decide to try to convince members of the other party to break ranks as a way to build pressure -- something these congressional veterans agree is certainly going in as a part of fiscal cliff negotiations .
`` That was key , '' Bonjean said , pointing out times when then-Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott would try to box in the Democratic leader Tom Daschle by recruiting centrist Democrat John Breaux to bring other Democrats on board .
`` While the negotiations were breaking down on issues like the tax cut or IDEA ( a disabilities law ) , you would try to pick off members and create a bipartisan resolution , '' he said .
One thing that has complicated the ability to get things done behind the scenes is the influence of social media , with an expanded press corps reporting every development , often in real time .
`` The media landscape has changed in this 24-hour news cycle we live in where every moment is tweeted , every utterance is put on a blog , every meeting is known before it even happens oftentimes , and it 's just much more difficult to get something done these days , '' Manley said .
Bonjean said `` sitting in a room and having it being live-tweeted out to the press '' makes leaders nervous as the deadline approaches .","Story highlights Public posturing continues, while tight circle of aides work behind the scenes

Influence of social media can complicate ability to negotiate successfully, insiders say

High-level negotiations between the White House and Capitol Hill in times of divided government tend to follow a script.

""From my perspective, it was always important to try not to get too wrapped up in the angry rhetoric and the charges being lobbed by either side because in the end my goal was to protect Sen. Reid and make sure he's in a position to get a deal done,"" Manley said.

Bonjean pointed out that Obama's campaign-style events could complicate talks: ""It really ticks Republicans off and actually hardens their position.""

But Democrats on Capitol Hill are applauding the president's strategy to concentrate in this negotiation on the outside messaging after their frustration that in previous talks he spent too much time trying privately to get House Republicans to compromise.

""The good news is that I think the president and his team finally came to the realization that they can't negotiate with hostage takers and that they've learned their lessons from the debt limit debacle last year,"" Manley said. ""They're prepared to take their case to the American people, which I think in this current atmosphere where the political process is largely broken, that that's the only game in town.""

In the two years since becoming speaker, Boehner has faced off with Reid and Obama on bills to avoid a government shutdown, raise the debt ceiling and renew tax cuts.

But Boehner previously had earned a reputation as a skilled negotiator as the chairman of the House Education Committee and worked across the aisle with Kennedy on the landmark No Child Left Behind education bill as well as pension reforms and disabilities legislation.

Manley worked for Kennedy then and observed Boehner up close. He pointed to those negotiations as instances when what was said outside the room didn't always match what was going on behind the scenes.

""Both were smart, wily legislators who realized there's a difference between what you say outside some times and what you agreed to when you actually begin negotiating.""

But there are points inevitably when the talks break down, and in many cases deals fall apart multiple times before they get revived.

Quietly, a leader of one party may decide to try to convince members of the other party to break ranks as a way to build pressure -- something these congressional veterans agree is certainly going in as a part of fiscal cliff negotiations.

""That was key,"" Bonjean said, pointing out times when then-Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott would try to box in the Democratic leader Tom Daschle by recruiting centrist Democrat John Breaux to bring other Democrats on board.

""While the negotiations were breaking down on issues like the tax cut or IDEA (a disabilities law), you would try to pick off members and create a bipartisan resolution,"" he said.

One thing that has complicated the ability to get things done behind the scenes is the influence of social media, with an expanded press corps reporting every development, often in real time.

""The media landscape has changed in this 24-hour news cycle we live in where every moment is tweeted, every utterance is put on a blog, every meeting is known before it even happens oftentimes, and it's just much more difficult to get something done these days,"" Manley said.

Bonjean said ""sitting in a room and having it being live-tweeted out to the press"" makes leaders nervous as the deadline approaches.",www.cnn.com,left,l8nshpRUyTSk2UU6

Listen to top Democrats and Republicans talk on camera , and it sounds like they could not be further apart on a year-end tax-and-spending deal — a down payment on a $ 4 trillion grand bargain .
But behind the scenes , top officials who have been involved in the talks for many months say the contours of a deal — including the size of tax hikes and spending cuts it will most likely contain — are starting to take shape .
Cut through the fog , and here ’ s what to expect : Taxes will go up just shy of $ 1.2 trillion — the middle ground of what President Barack Obama wants and what Republicans say they could stomach . Entitlement programs , mainly Medicare , will be cut by no less than $ 400 billion — and perhaps a lot more , to get Republicans to swallow those tax hikes . There will be at least $ 1.2 trillion in spending cuts and “ war savings. ” And any final deal will come not by a group effort but in a private deal between two men : Obama and House Speaker John Boehner ( R-Ohio ) . The two men had a 30-minute phone conversation Wednesday night — but the private lines of communications remain very much open .
No doubt , there will be lots of huffing and puffing before any deal can be had . And , no doubt , Obama and Congress could easily botch any or all three of the white-knuckle moments soon to hit this town : the automatic spending cuts and expiration of the Bush tax cuts , both of which kick in at the end of this year , and the federal debt limit that hits early next .

Listen to top Democrats and Republicans talk on camera, and it sounds like they could not be further apart on a year-end tax-and-spending deal — a down payment on a $4 trillion grand bargain.

But behind the scenes, top officials who have been involved in the talks for many months say the contours of a deal — including the size of tax hikes and spending cuts it will most likely contain — are starting to take shape.

Story Continued Below

( Also on POLITICO: Confident Obama sees path to fiscal cliff win)

Cut through the fog, and here’s what to expect: Taxes will go up just shy of $1.2 trillion — the middle ground of what President Barack Obama wants and what Republicans say they could stomach. Entitlement programs, mainly Medicare, will be cut by no less than $400 billion — and perhaps a lot more, to get Republicans to swallow those tax hikes. There will be at least $1.2 trillion in spending cuts and “war savings.” And any final deal will come not by a group effort but in a private deal between two men: Obama and House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). The two men had a 30-minute phone conversation Wednesday night — but the private lines of communications remain very much open.

No doubt, there will be lots of huffing and puffing before any deal can be had. And, no doubt, Obama and Congress could easily botch any or all three of the white-knuckle moments soon to hit this town: the automatic spending cuts and expiration of the Bush tax cuts, both of which kick in at the end of this year, and the federal debt limit that hits early next.

But it’s clear to veterans of this budget fight a deal is there to be done. Here is the state of play that is sketched out by top officials in both parties:

The coming tax hike

There is no chance taxes are not going up for people making north of $250,000 — and virtually no chance that doesn’t include their tax rates, too.

Republicans publicly say they are opposed to rate hikes — but privately they know they are going up, if not all the way to the Clinton-era 39.6 percent, then darn close.

The reason is simple math. Take a look at this list, and you will see that any tax loopholes worth closing won’t get Obama or Republicans close to their targets.

To those involved in the talks, it’s not really a mystery how big the overall hike will be. Boehner was for $800 billion before the election, and Obama slapped down an opening bid of $1.6 trillion after. So it doesn’t take Ernst and Young to add those numbers, divide by two and know the president wants to end up close to $1.2 trillion.

Who is trying to push the United States off the “fiscal cliff”? Many left-wing commentators predictably have placed the blame squarely on the Republicans. Yet a much stronger case can be made that the fault lies with President Obama.

Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner announced an astonishing proposal last week that called for a $1.6 trillion increase in taxes. This particular figure is double what most GOP politicians likely would be willing to accept when push comes to shove. If the GOP is still having trouble accepting roughly 50 percent of that amount, how on earth does Mr. Obama expect it ever to agree to this staggering new number?

Incredibly, it doesn’t stop there. Mr. Obama wants to increase the top income tax rate from 35 percent to 39.6 percent — exactly what it was during Bill Clinton’s presidency. In other words, it’s a good ol’ “soak the rich” campaign from a tax-and-spend liberal sitting in the Oval Office. There also reportedly will be $200 billion spent on so-called “economic growth” measures (to pay, ultimately, for Mr. Obama’s various spending increases over the next four years, no doubt) and $50 billion on infrastructure projects that likely will never see the light of day.

Mr. Obama also has suggested about $400 billion in cuts to health programs. Big deal.

Certainly, neither Democrats nor Republicans have acted perfectly during these important economic discussions. When you add everything together, the president clearly is trying to heave the U.S. over the cliff in more ways than one.

Republican House Speaker John A. Boehner recently said, “The Democrats have yet to get serious about real spending cuts.

Reid said Boehner wants to wait until after the new House re-elects him as speaker early next month before proceeding with a compromise -- one that will need support from both Democrats and Republicans to pass.

Polls show most back Obama

Obama and Democrats have leverage, based on the president's re-election last month and Democratic gains in the House and Senate in the new Congress. In addition, polls consistently show majority support for Obama's position on taxes.

The Gallup daily tracking poll released Wednesday showed 54% of respondents support Obama's handling of the fiscal cliff talks, compared with 26% who approve of Boehner's performance.

""We believe very strongly a reasonable package can get majorities in both (chambers),"" a senior White House official said. ""The only thing that would prevent it is if Sen. McConnell and Speaker Boehner don't cooperate.""

Anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist has vowed to back primary challenges against Republicans who violate his widely signed pledge not to raise taxes. Even if a deal is reached, he predicts budget showdowns will continue -- every time the government needs more money to operate.

""There the Republicans have a lot of clout because they can say we'll let you run the government for the next month, but you've got to make these reforms,"" he said this week.

On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told Congress the government would reach its borrowing limit at year's end, but could take steps to create what he called ""headroom"" for two months or so.

However, Geithner said uncertainty about the fiscal cliff and deficit negotiations make it hard to predict precisely how long government measures to address the situation will last.

Crisis two years in the making

The possibility of a fiscal cliff was set in motion over the past two years as a way to force action on mounting government debt.

Now, legislators risk looking politically cynical by seeking to weaken the measures enacted to try to force them to confront tough questions regarding deficit reduction, such as changes to government programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.

The two sides seemingly had made progress early last week on forging a $2 trillion deficit reduction deal that included new revenue sought by Obama and spending cuts and entitlement changes desired by Boehner.

Obama's latest offer set $400,000 as the income threshold for a tax rate increase, up from his original plan of $250,000. It also had a new formula for the consumer price index -- called chained CPI -- that wraps in new assumptions on consumer habits in response to rising prices, such as seeking cheaper alternatives, and would result in smaller benefit increases.

Statistics supplied by opponents say the change would mean Social Security recipients would get $6,000 less in benefits over the first 15 years of chained CPI. Liberal groups have openly challenged the plan, calling it a betrayal of senior citizens who contributed all their lives for their benefits.

Boehner appeared to move on increased tax revenue, including higher rates on top income brackets and eliminating deductions and loopholes. But his inability to rally all House Republicans behind his plan last week raised questions about his role and what comes next.

Reid and other Senate Democrats say House Republicans must accept that an agreement will require support from legislators in both parties, rather than the GOP majority in the House pushing through a measure on its own.

Anyone hoping that the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre might change dynamics in the nation 's capital when it comes to the issue of guns met some level of Washington reality on Wednesday .
President Obama held a news conference to announce his response to the Connecticut killings of 26 grade-schoolers and educators , including his naming of Vice President Joe Biden to head a team that will recommend in a month actions that might help prevent future Sandy Hooks .
But when Obama began taking questions , the White House press corps did n't ask about gun violence . Instead , journalists focused on fiscal cliff negotiations . And the president accommodated them with the kind of lengthy , discursive answers he is famous for , which cause many a listener 's mind to wander ( and perhaps on Wednesday , wonder if the session would end before someone could follow up with a gun violence question ) .
This did not go unnoticed by some in the mainstream media and others on social media .
Journalists eventually did get around to asking the president follow-up questions about his gun announcement , including ABC News ' Jake Tapper , who asked the president a question that has been on many minds , namely , `` Where have you been '' the past four years on the issue of gun violence ?
To which the president essentially said he was busy on other matters , like rescuing the U.S. economy .
Obama 's news conference was followed by an appearance by House Speaker John Boehner , advertised by his office as a `` media availability . '' As it turned out , the speaker was n't all that available .

Anyone hoping that the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre might change dynamics in the nation's capital when it comes to the issue of guns met some level of Washington reality on Wednesday.

President Obama held a news conference to announce his response to the Connecticut killings of 26 grade-schoolers and educators, including his naming of Vice President Joe Biden to head a team that will recommend in a month actions that might help prevent future Sandy Hooks.

But when Obama began taking questions, the White House press corps didn't ask about gun violence. Instead, journalists focused on fiscal cliff negotiations. And the president accommodated them with the kind of lengthy, discursive answers he is famous for, which cause many a listener's mind to wander (and perhaps on Wednesday, wonder if the session would end before someone could follow up with a gun violence question).

This did not go unnoticed by some in the mainstream media and others on social media.

Journalists eventually did get around to asking the president follow-up questions about his gun announcement, including ABC News' Jake Tapper, who asked the president a question that has been on many minds, namely, ""Where have you been"" the past four years on the issue of gun violence?

To which the president essentially said he was busy on other matters, like rescuing the U.S. economy.

Obama's news conference was followed by an appearance by House Speaker John Boehner, advertised by his office as a ""media availability."" As it turned out, the speaker wasn't all that available.

He stood before the mics and cameras for all of 51 seconds to chide the president for allegedly being unserious in the fiscal cliff negotiations, then disappeared back into his office. Reporters didn't have a chance to ask him about guns.

A group of House Democrats, meanwhile, held a news conference to call on the Republicans who control the House to schedule a vote by Saturday on legislation by Rep. Carolyn McCarthy of New York and Rep. Diana DeGette of Colorado that would ban the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines.

But there are no signs that a vote will be scheduled for the legislation — which was drafted months before the Newtown massacre.

In a sign of just how little the prevailing partisan atmosphere has been changed by the Newtown tragedy, DeGette said that since House members returned to work Monday, ""in just over 24 hours we've picked up 21 co-sponsors, and we believe we'll have even more by the end of today.

""Sadly, none of those co-sponsors are Republicans, and we have approached many of our Republican friends and colleagues. Some of them say they're thinking about it,"" said DeGette. ""And we hope they think hard about it.""",www.npr.org,center,DzIWvIv45oCCBzN5

There's more than one cliff drawing controversy this month. The federal farm bill is one of many items caught in congressional gridlock.

Dairy farmers now have no safety net if milk prices fall. And with feed prices soaring, many feel they're falling off a cliff of their own.

Here’s what these progressives fear: an agreement that keeps lower tax rates for the wealthy, hits the social safety net with unpalatable cuts and leaves Pentagon spending unscathed. In other words, they’d rather walk the country off the cliff than watch President Barack Obama cave on long-held liberal priorities.

Bolstering the Democrats’ strategy is the belief that the “fiscal cliff” is actually shaped more like a “slope” where the economic effects will be felt gradually, not immediately. That theory gives Congress some time at the beginning of 2013 to set tax rates and configure budget cuts in a different political environment and with a new class of lawmakers.

But underlying the tough talk is also a sense of liberal angst — the left feels like it was burned by the last extension of the Bush tax rates and didn’t get much of what it wanted in the 2011 debt-limit deal.

If tax rates snap back to the higher levels from the 1990s and painful budget cuts start to hit the Pentagon, these Democrats — led by Washington Sen.

And with a January deal, Republicans would technically avoid violating the no-new-taxes pledge that most of them have signed because they would then be voting to cut taxes.

It's apparently still too early for any of Washington's top policymakers to start blinking in the ""fiscal cliff"" stare-down. So there's no need to panic — yet.

That's the real message of Monday's congressional Republican counteroffer to President Obama's proposal for avoiding the ""fiscal cliff,"" the combination of major tax increases and drastic spending cuts scheduled for the end of the year.

Those large tax hikes and spending reductions could lead to another recession, economists warn.

The House Republicans' offer, not surprisingly, didn't include a tax-rate hike on the wealthiest taxpayers, a requirement Obama has said is nonnegotiable if there's to be a pact.

Of course, House Speaker John Boehner and other Republican leaders have, for their part, called such a rate increase a nonstarter.

Obviously, before this is all over, one side is going to have to yield on this fundamental issue of higher tax rates for couples whose households have more than $250,000 in income (or single individuals with incomes of more than $200,000).

Neither side on Monday sounded like it intended to be the first to make significant concessions, however. Answering questions on Twitter, the president insisted his approach of allowing higher tax rates on the top 2 percent of taxpayers was the only way to avoid bigger spending cuts to programs the middle class relies on while still achieving deficit-reduction targets.

House Republicans relied, in part, on changes that would make Medicare less generous to future beneficiaries. Obama has rejected similar proposals in the past.

So far apart are the Obama proposal and the House GOP counterproposal, trying to reconcile them into some sort of agreement by the end of the year seems about as doable as squaring a circle.

Conventional wisdom, however, is that the negotiators don't have equal leverage, that the president has the stronger hand. After all, he won re-election on the campaign promise that he would fight for higher taxes on the highest-income taxpayers. Polls repeatedly show that a solid majority of voters support his position.

Unfortunately, the nation is getting plenty of experience with these end-of-the-year cliffhangers, so to speak.

In 2010, Obama and House Republicans fought until nearly the last moment over extending the Bush tax cuts and long-term jobless benefits past their expiration date, the end of that year.

As NPR and others cover the story, we'll try to to point to interesting reports and analyses. Here are three of the latest.

-- ""Obama To GOP: I'm Done Negotiating With Myself,"" by Ezra Klein on The Washington Post's Wonkblog. Klein writes that:

""We're seeing two things here. One is that the negotiations aren't going well. When one side begins leaking the other side's proposals, that's typically a bad sign. The other is that Republicans are frustrated at the new Obama they're facing: The Obama who refuses to negotiate with himself.

""That's what you're really seeing in this 'proposal.' Previously, Obama's pattern had been to offer plans that roughly tracked where he thought the compromise should end up. The White House's belief was that by being solicitous in their policy proposals, they would win goodwill on the other side, and even if they didn't, the media would side with them, realizing they'd sought compromise and been rebuffed. They don't believe that anymore.""

-- ""McConnell 'Burst Into Laughter' as Geithner Outlined Obama's Plan,"" by Fred Barnes for The Weekly Standard. He reports that:

""Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, says he 'burst into laughter' Thursday when Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner outlined the administration proposal for averting the fiscal cliff. He wasn't trying to embarrass Geithner, McConnell says, only responding candidly to his one-sided plan, explicit on tax increases, vague on spending cuts.""

-- ""How Much Income Taxes Could Rise: A Breakdown Of The Options,"" by NPR's John Ydstie on our It's All Politics blog. In the negotiations, John writes:

""Perhaps the most important sticking point is over income tax rates. The outcome of the negotiations will determine how many Americans will face higher tax rates — and how much of a hike it will be.""",www.npr.org,center,F0TZDbr1LSA3W9aX

But the task of averting more than $600 billion in tax hikes and spending cuts in less than a week is daunting even by Washington standards -- though as usual, the predicament is the product of lawmakers' failure to act sooner.

The fiscal cliff is a Washington-made mess that is rooted in a broader dysfunction over fiscal policy.

The biggest parts of the fiscal cliff are roughly $400 billion in tax increases.

Why are taxes going up? Primarily because more than a decade's worth of ""temporary"" tax cuts and one-year tax ""fixes"" are expiring. These are measures that lawmakers passed, then renewed time and again.

No one really believed the tax cuts were temporary. But by categorizing them as such, lawmakers made them look less expensive and easier to pay for.

And Congress was also able to put off, year after year, the tough fiscal choices they need to make about tax policy -- such as whether a tax cut is still useful or just a revenue giveaway?

Another key part of the fiscal cliff is the so-called sequester, which will set off nearly $1 trillion worth of blunt, broad spending cuts.

The sequester is the direct result of Congress attempting to get itself out of an earlier self-made crisis -- raising the debt ceiling in 2011 to avoid defaulting on U.S. debt.

In the name of fiscal responsibility, some Republican lawmakers publicly toyed with the idea of letting the country default on its debt unless Congress agreed to spending cuts that matched in magnitude any increase in the debt ceiling.

Everyone who voted for the sequester knew it would be damaging. Indeed, it was intended to be distasteful to Republicans and Democrats alike. The idea was to force the two sides to come up with a better way to reduce deficits before the sequester actually took effect.

Obviously, that plan hasn't worked yet.

What's more, the sequester wasn't set up to actually address the long-term drivers of the debt -- especially government health care spending.

After last year's debt ceiling deal passed, Bob Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan deficit watchdog group put it this way: ""No one should pretend that they have solved anything other than an artificial political crisis.""

Story Continued Below

The Senate was poised to vote on the package some time after the clock turned to 2013 on New Year’s morning, and the House could vote later in the day on Jan. 1.

The final deal was hammered out between Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Vice President Joe Biden, after nearly two months of talks between other leaders failed. President Barack Obama called Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) Monday night, and a Democratic source said both leaders signed off on the package.

But there were indications that might have slightly overstated the case: A Senate Democratic aide insisted that Reid simply offered to give Biden a chance to sell Senate Democrats on the accord, as the vice president did at a 90-minute meeting at the Capitol. And Pelosi, in a statement issued shortly after 10 p.m., did not endorse or criticize the pact: the California Democrat said she was waiting for the Senate to act and then would present it to House Democrats to gauge their reaction.

Criticism came from all quarters, though it was unclear whether it represented a serious threat to the accord’s prospects in Congress or the kind of complaints that were bound to precede such a difficult vote. Moderate Senate Democrats like Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) said the deal “kicked the can down the road” by failing to include entitlement reform. Liberals such as Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) complained that Obama and Biden gave away too much on taxes.

There was also a tactical divide between Senate Democrats and the White House. Many Hill Democrats believed they would get a much better deal if they waited until the new year and the country went over the fiscal cliff, but Obama did not want to risk blame for potentially pushing the United States back into a recession.

Biden was enlisted to help sell the package to a skeptical caucus. Still, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said while Democrats have reservations, most agreed the deal is better than going over the cliff. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) called the mood in the caucus “somber.”

Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) said he’s “not happy but it’s preventing an increase of tax rates for middle income Americans, and that’s very good.”

Leaving the caucus meeting, Biden said he felt “very good” about the deal’s chances, warning reporters not to predict how the House or Senate would vote.

Nearly all the major players in the fiscal cliff negotiations are starting to agree on one thing : A deal is virtually impossible before the New Year .

Fiscal cliff deal increasingly unlikely

Nearly all the major players in the fiscal cliff negotiations are starting to agree on one thing: A deal is virtually impossible before the New Year.

Unlike the bank bailout in 2008, the tax deal in 2010 and the debt ceiling in 2011, the Senate almost certainly won’t swoop in and help sidestep a potential economic calamity, senior officials in both parties predicted on Wednesday.

With the country teetering on this fiscal cliff of deep spending cuts and sharp tax hikes, the philosophical differences, the shortened timetable and the political dynamics appear to be insurmountable hurdles for a bipartisan deal by New Year’s Day.

Hopes of a grand-bargain — to shave trillions of dollars off the deficit by cutting entitlement programs and raising revenue — are shattered. House Republicans already failed to pass their “Plan B” proposal. And now aides and senators say the White House’s smaller, fall-back plan floated last week is a non-starter among Republicans in Senate — much less the House.

On top of that, the Treasury Department announced Wednesday that the nation would hit the debt limit on Dec. 31, and would then have to take “extraordinary measures” to avoid exhausting the government’s borrowing limit in the New Year.

Senate Democrats are considering fallback options to resolve the crisis, but they appear unlikely to push forward if Republicans decide to mount a serious opposition. The White House, a senior administration official said, is in close coordination with Senate Democrats. Late Wednesday, Reid’s office pushed Republicans to pass a bill to extend tax rates for income below $250,000.

A meeting at the White House between Congressional leaders and President Barack Obama is likely this week, sources said.

The House sidestepped a decision Wednesday to bring the chamber back into session, putting the burden squarely on the Senate, where the stars will need to align for swift action in the next few days. Speaker John Boehner’s leadership team said bluntly: the “Senate first must act” before the House will consider additional legislation to avoid the cliff. So that they’re all on the same page, House Republicans will have a members only conference call Thursday.

( Also on POLITICO: Treasury: U.S. will hit debt limit New Year’s Eve)

For Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to bring up a new bill, he’ll need assurances from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell not to filibuster it — and not to pressure his members to block it. And Reid will need Boehner’s word that any Senate-passed bill would be scheduled for a vote and could pass with support largely from Democrats, even if it lacks a majority of Republican support.

That scenario seems unlikely right now.

From McConnell’s perspective, the White House will have to pare back its demands for tax increases if Republicans will concede the fight and risk the wrath from the right. And then President Barack Obama will need to give far more on cuts to entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security in order to get some GOP cooperation on tax rate hikes, Republican officials say.",www.politico.com,left,eK1VdKW9d1IouKWz

The tax hikes, combined with the spending cuts, could trigger another recession if they are not dealt with soon, economists warn. The fiscal deal, though, still pushes off a permanent decision on the spending cuts until two months down the road, when lawmakers could find themselves in a similar position -- only this time, with the debt ceiling playing a far more prominent role.

Of course, any rate increase for Republicans — one that rank-and-file lawmakers could back and defend — would have to come with serious cuts to entitlement programs. And there’s no evidence President Barack Obama and Democrats have given in on any specific entitlement cuts in closed-door negotiations — especially enough to offset a rate change and an increase in the threshold for the rich.

“Both sides have to hold hands and jump on this one,” said a top Senate aide.

Yet if House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) are unable to come to an agreement with Obama, the highest marginal tax rate will jump from 35 percent to 39.6 percent on Jan. 1, the same as it was under former President Bill Clinton.

There are numerous problems with the modest tax hikes for entitlement cuts trade off, which GOP Hill aides stressed has not been formally offered yet.

First, Democrats believe they are dealing from a place of strength in these negotiations and are unlikely to give up concessions on entitlement programs without big moves by Boehner.

“We are winning,” said a top Hill Democratic staffer. “We don’t have to give up on anything yet.”

Boehner also faces pressure from his right and is concerned whether House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) and Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) will support him. He has so far refused to agree to any increase in tax rates even though many in his party are already acknowledging such an outcome is unavoidable. The best Republicans can do, these lawmakers say, is limit the size of the increases while working to shift the political blame to Democrats.

“The speaker is opposed to raising tax rates, because raising tax rates costs jobs,” said Michael Steel, spokesman for Boehner.

On top of that, any suggestion Republicans could back a tax increase faces some stiff opposition in the Senate.

“That doesn’t really help solve the problem,” Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said of increasing the tax threshold for the wealthy. Hatch is ranking member of the powerful Finance Committee. “I’m against raising tax rates.

The United States technically will go over the fiscal cliff for at least a short period of time .
The House said that it wo n't consider any fiscal cliff legislation Monday night , even if a compromise deal is reached in the Senate overnight .
Practically speaking , lawmakers likely have a `` grace period '' of a couple of weeks to pass a bill that wards off the bulk of scheduled tax increases and spending cuts without causing too much damage . But there 's no guarantee that they 'd be able to forge a final agreement quickly after Jan. 1 .
That means Americans could be living with continued uncertainty about tax and spending policies for an indefinite period in 2013 .
And that uncertainty is likely to create problems for tax filers , payroll processors , wage earners , doctors , federal contractors , federal agencies , federal workers and the unemployed -- to name just a few . They are the ones who will pay an increasing price as lawmakers try to redeem themselves and come up with a deal in January or February .
Your paycheck : If you 'll be paid in the coming week , your company 's payroll processor probably already cut your check . And since they did n't have guidance from the IRS regarding 2013 withholding tables , they used 2012 withholding rates .
So in that sense , your paycheck in early January wo n't be much different than what it was in December .
But your paycheck still will be smaller , because the 2 % payroll tax holiday is expiring . Starting in January , workers will once again have 6.2 % of their wages up to $ 113,700 withheld to pay for Social Security , up from the 4.2 % rate that 's been in effect for the past two years .
Effectively that means someone making $ 50,000 might get about $ 83 less a month in their paychecks . Someone making twice that would see their pay reduced by roughly $ 167 a month .
If you 're getting a bonus , you 'll have more withheld there , too , said Michael O'Toole , senior director of government relations for the American Payroll Association . That 's because there 's one supplemental withholding rate that applies to bonuses . This year it 's 25 % , but it 's set to rise to 28 % on Jan. 1 , unless Congress decides to change it .
For paychecks that will be cut later in January , the IRS late Monday issued guidance instructing payroll processors to assume all the Bush tax cuts expire . The agency , however , gave processors until Feb. 15 to begin to use the tables and said if Congress passes a law that extends any of the Bush tax cuts it would issue new guidance .
In the meantime , paychecks issued could be smaller if payroll processors change their systems to incorporate the 2013 withholding rates .

Your 2012 tax return : Here 's where things potentially become a dumb mess .
The IRS warned lawmakers that if they do n't act to protect the middle class from having to pay the Alternative Minimum Tax for tax year 2012 by Dec. 31 , up to 100 million taxpayers may not be able to file their 2012 taxes until late March .
That would mean their refunds will be delayed . And they would n't be injecting those refunds into the economy during the first quarter .
Based on Treasury Department records from the past three years , refunds paid during January , February and March combined have ranged from $ 117 billion to $ 136 billion .
Government spending : Unless lawmakers avert the so-called sequester , a series of automatic cuts will reduce the budgets of most federal agencies and programs by 8 % to 10 % .
But that does n't necessarily mean those cuts would have to occur immediately , according to a former official with the Office of Management and Budget .
Both the White House budget office and federal agencies themselves will have some latitude to postpone the cuts from occurring `` for several weeks if necessary , '' added OMB Watch , a group that monitors the federal budget .
The cuts , if not reversed , would likely lead to unpaid furloughs of federal workers . Agencies must give at least 30 days ' notice to employees for a furlough that would last less than 22 work days ; 60 days ' notice is required for longer furloughs . So far , federal workers have been told to report to work as scheduled on Jan. 2 , the day the spending cuts formally kick in .
U.S. economy : Economists expect the U.S. economy would fall into a recession if Congress does nothing to avert the fiscal cliff and lets it stay in effect .
Specifically , the CBO forecasts a drop of 0.5 % in real gross domestic product and a 9.1 % unemployment rate by the end of next year .
On the bright side , no one expects that Congress would let all fiscal cliff measures have their way with the economy for an extended period .
But there could still be an economic hit if lawmakers push the country over the fiscal cliff temporarily and then pass a fallback deal that primarily averts just some of the tax increases .
For example , Congress may end up passing only a stopgap measure that does not address the automatic spending cuts or raise the country 's debt ceiling . In that case , economic growth could be dragged down somewhat in the first half of next year , according to economists at Goldman Sachs .
And remember that the economy is already going to be dragged back somewhat by the expected expiration of the payroll tax cut .
Unemployment benefits : A federal extension of unemployment benefits is set to expire . If Congress does not renew it , workers who lost their jobs after July 1 , 2012 , will only receive up to 26 weeks in state unemployment benefits , down from as many as 73 weeks in state and federal benefits that have been available in 2012 .
As a result , more than 2 million of the long-term unemployed will run out of benefits at the end of this year , according to the National Employment Law Project , an advocacy group .
And another 1 million workers will exhaust their 26 weeks in the first quarter of next year and will not be able to sign up for the federal extension .
If Congress chooses early next year to keep the extension in place , and makes the extension retroactive , many of the 2 million who fell off the rolls may be paid retroactively , said Rick McHugh , a NELP staff attorney .
Doctors ' pay : Medicare physicians are facing a nearly 27 % cut in their payments for treating Medicare patients because Congress has failed to pass the so-called doc fix to override that scheduled cut , as they usually do . They face a potential additional cut because of the sequester .
But here again there may be a few weeks ' grace period for Congress to change its mind and reverse the cut .

But what happened?

Last weekend some of Boehner's big concessions-including an increase on tax rates for millionaires and an agreement to raise the debt limit–started to leak out, according to Republican sources. When Boehner came into his leadership meeting Monday morning, he got an earful from fellow Republicans, who said his strategy wasn't going to fly.

Late last week, GOP leaders had already started talking more seriously about a legislative path, so they decided why not take Plan B – raising taxes only on those making more than a million dollars a year – to the floor. The move also allowed Republicans to still protect most small businesses, which make less than $1 million a year. The fact that Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi had endorsed it two years ago made them think that it would be an easier sell than it was.

Boehner reminded GOP members that while he does not want tax rates to go up, the American people disagree. One source said Boehner was effectively trying to save Republicans from themselves and prevent them from being painted as they are today – so extreme that they won't even raise taxes on millionaires.

Boehner did, however, have a majority of Republicans on his side, but it wasn't enough without help from Democrats. A Democratic source said House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer was successful at ensuring the few moderate Democrats didn't cross party lines.

Meanwhile, many more GOP members than anticipated by House Republican leaders started saying no to Plan B because they simply did not want to go on record supporting any tax increase, especially one that had no chance of passing. One source involved in whipping GOP votes said a number of undecided members fell into the ""no"" column when Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid repeatedly made it clear he would not take up the bill. What's the point, many asked.

Apparently, by the time a vote to replace the sequester with spending cuts took place at about 6:30 p.m. ET Thursday night, GOP leaders already knew they were not likely to get the votes for Plan B. Conservative groups were working hard to make that vote close, an effort to show the leadership that Plan B had no chance of getting enough GOP votes.

By that time, the GOP leaders' scramble had morphed into panic.

At 7:45 p.m. ET, inside a hastily arranged GOP conference, Boehner opened the meeting with the serenity prayer. House GOP conferences, which are held in private, are always opened with the pledge and a prayer, but the prayer is usually done by a rank and file member. This time, it came from the House speaker.

Boehner then announced they are pulling the bill. Some boos, as well as some cheers, could be heard from outside the door. One of the cheers came from Rep. Alan Nunnelee of Mississippi, who had open heart surgery this week but came back for the vote to support the speaker, a source said.

Then–as everyone was about to leave-Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania grabbed the microphone and started berating the conference for failing the speaker, telling his colleagues they need to do this. He shouted to the back of the room to Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the GOP whip, asking how far away they are from the number of votes necessary to pass the bill.

McCarthy responded saying, ""Mike, we're not going to get there.""

The speaker chimed in and said there is nothing more we can do.

In Washington's latest game of chicken, President Obama is counting on voters who see things his way to give him the edge in his quest to get congressional Republicans to accept tax increases on the nation's wealthiest as part of any fiscal cliff deal.

To energize those voters, the president is ramping up a series of campaign-style events meant to educate the public about the stakes, as he sees them, of letting the Bush-era tax cuts for middle-class Americans expire if no agreement is reached by year's end.

It's all about raising the pressure on Republican lawmakers enough, especially those in the House, so that at least some will soften their opposition to tax increases for families earning more than $250,000. Whether the president's tactic will work remains to be seen.

On Wednesday, Obama added a twist to the White House campaign for public support. He urged voters to use social media to express themselves to members of Congress.

At a White House event with a group of everyday Americans serving as a backdrop, Obama even supplied supporters with a new Twitter hashtag for their messages: #my2k. The hashtag incorporated the president's argument that an average middle-class family would have to pay an additional $2,200 in federal income taxes if no agreement is reached.

""Call your members of Congress, write them an email, post it on their Facebook walls,"" Obama told his audience. ""You can tweet it using the hashtag 'My2K' "" Not 'Y2K [laughter].' 'My2K.' We figured that would make it a little easier to remember.""

For Obama, the hashtag-slinging public relations effort was the 2012 version of a president's traditional White House bully pulpit to further his agenda. It was also an attempt to tap into the energy of the president's supporters, who gave him the opportunity of a second term.

To a significant extent, Obama would seem to have an easier PR task than congressional Republicans. According to Election Day exit polls, a majority of voters agree with him that taxes should be increased on the wealthiest Americans.

As Obama has repeated since his re-election, the issue of higher taxes on the wealthy was exhaustively debated during his campaign against Republican Mitt Romney — and the president's side won.

Because of that, even a political scientist who has become well known in the field for persuasively arguing that the power of the bully pulpit is overrated gives Obama the edge in the message war with Republicans.

""The public favors resolving the fiscal cliff problem in general and by raising tax rates on the wealthy in particular,"" George C. Edwards III of Texas A&M University wrote in an email response to a question. ""So the president does not have to persuade the public on these points. He just has to make pre-existing views more salient to members of Congress. This is an example of a president exploiting an opportunity in his environment without having to create one by changing people's minds.""

Obama was clearly counting on a repeat of earlier moments of his presidency, when public pressure caused House Republicans to accept an extension of the payroll tax holiday, among other proposals aimed at helping middle-income Americans.

Obama said Wednesday:

""Some of you may remember that a year ago, during our last big fight to protect middle-class families, tens of thousands of working Americans called and tweeted and emailed their representatives, asking them to do the right thing. ""And sure enough, it worked. The same thing happened earlier this year when college students across the country stood up and demanded that Congress keep rates low on their student loans.

Sometime in the next 10 days , a fiscal cliff agreement is likely .
It almost certainly wo n't be the grand bargain sought by President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner that addresses the nation 's chronic federal deficits and debt .
It may not happen before January 1 , the trigger date for the automatic tax increases on everyone and deep spending cuts of the fiscal cliff .
When it does occur , a deal will likely be similar to proposals rejected by Republicans during similar brinksmanship efforts of the past two years .

Obama is heading back to Washington on Wednesday night from his Hawaiian vacation , leaving behind the first family , to be ready if the Senate comes up with a plan when it returns Thursday from its own Christmas break .
Meanwhile , House Republican leaders held a conference call Wednesday afternoon but made no decision about when to bring their members back to Washington , according to a GOP source on the call . Members were told last week they would receive 48 hours ' notice if they needed to return after Christmas .
The principal dispute continues to be over taxes , specifically the demand by Obama and Democrats to extend most of the tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush while allowing higher rates of the 1990s to return on top income brackets .
Obama campaigned for re-election on keeping the current lower tax rates on family income up to $ 250,000 , which he argues would protect 98 % of Americans and 97 % of small businesses from rates that increase on income above that level .
Republicans oppose any kind of increase in tax rates , and Boehner suffered the political indignity last week of offering a compromise -- a $ 1 million threshold for the higher rates to kick in -- that his colleagues refused to support because it raised taxes and had no chance of passing the Democrat-controlled Senate .
Rep. Nan Hayworth , R-New York , acknowledged Wednesday that a deal will have to include some form of higher rates on top income brackets , but she said her party would fight to make it as minimal as possible .
`` If that 's where people have to go , we 'll make the threshold as high as we can , '' Hayworth said on CNN , arguing that higher taxes in any form burden economic growth . `` Because the more relief we provide , the better off we 'll be . ''
Hayworth also made clear that a limited agreement was the most to expect for now , saying : `` I do n't think we 're going to get the big plan in the next six days . ''
A statement Wednesday by Boehner 's leadership team said the Democratic-controlled Senate must act first on proposals already passed by the House but rejected by Senate leaders and Obama .

`` If the Senate will not approve and send them to the president to be signed into law in their current form , they must be amended and returned to the House , '' the leadership statement said . `` Once this has occurred , the House will then consider whether to accept the bills as amended , or to send them back to the Senate with additional amendments . The House will take this action on whatever the Senate can pass , but the Senate first must act . ''
Obama and Democrats have leverage , based on the president 's re-election last month and Democratic gains in the House and Senate in the new Congress that will convene in January . In addition , polls consistently show majority support for Obama 's position on taxes .
Economists warn that failure to avoid the fiscal cliff could bring a recession , and stocks have been down since the middle of last week , when apparent progress in the talks suddenly unraveled with Boehner proposing his own `` Plan B '' that was rejected by fellow House Republicans .
The Gallup daily tracking poll released Wednesday showed 54 % of respondents support Obama 's handling of the fiscal cliff negotiations , compared with 26 % who approve of Boehner 's performance .
Sen. Harry Reid , the Democratic majority leader in the Senate , had an approval rating of 34 % for his role so far .
Reid is poised to assume a larger role as the focus of negotiations appears to be shifting to the Senate after last week 's GOP disarray in the House stymied any progress before Christmas .
A senior Senate Democratic source told CNN on Wednesday that Reid has made clear in private conversations that he will need assurance any plan can pass both the Senate and the House before he will bring it up .
`` It is to nobody 's advantage to have a failed Senate vote at this point , '' the source said on condition of not being identified . `` This will be the last train we will have , and there is no sense in it leaving the station before we have assurance it will get through . ''
Remaining questions include whether enough Republicans will support a compromise acceptable to Democrats , and whether Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell will allow a simple majority vote to take up and pass any proposal , or stick to the filibuster level of 60 % .
`` We believe very strongly a reasonable package can get majorities in both houses , '' a senior White House official said . `` The only thing that would prevent it is if Senator McConnell and Speaker Boehner do n't cooperate . ''
Some Senate Democrats have discussed holding off on bringing up a proposal until the final days of 2012 to increase pressure on Republicans to support avoiding higher taxes on everyone due to the fiscal cliff
While the focus now is on a possible agreement in coming days or weeks , anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist told CNN earlier this week that the nation should gird for long-range battle .
`` It 's four years of a fight . It 's not one week of a fight , '' said Norquist , who has threatened to mount primary challenges against Republicans who violate a pledge they signed at his behest against ever voting for a tax increase .
While both sides say they want to avoid the fiscal cliff , signs are emerging that a deal would come after the new year to blunt the harshest impacts .
Under that scenario , the new Congress convening in early January would vote to lower taxes from the higher rates that will go into effect in January when the Bush cuts expire , with the new top rates staying intact .
According to a senior administration official , Obama continues to oppose a Republican call for extending the Bush-era tax cuts for everyone to buy time for working out a broader deficit reduction deal that would include overall tax reform .
However , a Senate Republican leadership aide told CNN that Republicans reject Obama 's $ 250,000 threshold for tax cut extensions .
`` We 're going to be here New Year 's Eve , '' retiring Sen. Joe Lieberman said Sunday on CNN 's `` State of the Union , '' adding that it was likely the nation would go over the fiscal cliff .
Failing to meet the year-end deadline on striking a deal would amount to `` the most colossal , consequential act of congressional irresponsibility in a long time , '' said Lieberman , an independent from Connecticut who caucuses with Democrats . `` Maybe ever in American history , because of the impact it will have on almost every American . ''
However , Norquist called the situation part of a longer process , predicting `` a regular fight '' when Congress needs to authorize more government spending and raise the federal debt ceiling in coming months .
`` There the Republicans have a lot of clout because they can say we 'll let you run the government for the next month , but you 've got to make these reforms , '' he explained .
On Wednesday , Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner informed Congress that the government would reach its borrowing limit at the end of the year -- in five days ' time -- but could take steps to create what he called `` headroom '' for two months or so .
However , Geithner said uncertainty over the fiscal cliff negotiations and possible changes to the deficit situation made it difficult to predict precisely how long the government 's steps to ease the situation would last .
Before heading to Hawaii last Friday , Obama called for Congress to come back after Christmas and work with him on a limited agreement to prevent tax hikes on the middle class , extend unemployment insurance and set a framework for future deficit reduction steps .
Boehner 's spokesman said the speaker will be `` ready to find a solution that can pass both houses of Congress '' when he returns to Washington , expected to occur on Thursday .
The GOP opposition to any kind of tax rate increase has stalled deficit negotiations for two years and led to unusual political drama , such as McConnell recently filibustering a proposal he introduced and Thursday night 's rebuff by House Republicans of the alternative tax plan pushed by Boehner , their leader .
Reid and other Senate Democrats say House Republicans must accept that agreement will require support from legislators in both parties , rather than a GOP majority in the House pushing through a measure on its own .
He insisted that a Senate-passed plan with Obama 's $ 250,000 threshold would pass the House if Boehner would allow a vote . However , the Senate proposal is held up on constitutional grounds , because legislation that increases revenue must originate in the House .
Boehner and Republicans complain the Senate has refused to take up any proposals they have passed in the past two years . Reid argues that the GOP measures amount to a conservative wish list of unacceptable spending cuts and reforms intended to shrink government and weaken entitlement programs vital to senior citizens , the poor and the disabled .
Some House Republicans have said they would join Democrats in supporting the president 's proposal in hopes of moving past the volatile issue to focus on the spending cuts and entitlement reforms they seek .

Called chained CPI , the new formula includes assumptions on consumer habits in response to rising prices , such as seeking cheaper alternatives , and would result in smaller benefit increases in future years .

Secretary Geithner warns the government will reach the debt ceiling soon

President Obama and senators are heading back to Washington

The fiscal cliff deadline was created by Congress, which now seeks to avoid it

Sometime in the next 10 days, a fiscal cliff agreement is likely.

It almost certainly won't be the grand bargain sought by President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner that addresses the nation's chronic federal deficits and debt.

It may not happen before January 1, the trigger date for the automatic tax increases on everyone and deep spending cuts of the fiscal cliff.

When it does occur, a deal will likely be similar to proposals rejected by Republicans during similar brinksmanship efforts of the past two years.

""It's all about scoring political points,"" GOP Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen complained Wednesday on CNN, referring to both sides in the debate. ""I know the American people are tired of all of us.""

Obama is heading back to Washington on Wednesday night from his Hawaiian vacation, leaving behind the first family, to be ready if the Senate comes up with a plan when it returns Thursday from its own Christmas break.

Meanwhile, House Republican leaders held a conference call Wednesday afternoon but made no decision about when to bring their members back to Washington, according to a GOP source on the call. Members were told last week they would receive 48 hours' notice if they needed to return after Christmas.

The principal dispute continues to be over taxes, specifically the demand by Obama and Democrats to extend most of the tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush while allowing higher rates of the 1990s to return on top income brackets.

Despite his re-election and more Democratic seats in Congress , President Obama has far from a free hand to make the kind of comprehensive deal House Speaker John Boehner and other Republicans are demanding — one that includes cuts to entitlement programs .
Strong resistance to that notion is coming from the political left , including warnings that while Obama wo n't have another re-election , most of his allies on Capitol Hill will be facing voters again .
`` Any benefit cuts to Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid have to be off the table , '' said Ilya Sheyman , campaign director for MoveOn.org Civic Action , in an interview . `` I think it 's certainly true that no Democratic member of Congress — whether it 's in the House or the Senate — should be surprised if they end up facing a primary after voting to cut Medicare , Medicaid and Social Security programs . ''
Sheyman said the performance of political progressives in turning out the vote for Democrats in the recent election gives them the right not only to be heard but also to have their demands met that entitlements be left unscathed in negotiations to avert the combination of major tax increases and drastic spending cuts scheduled for the end of the year .
That 's a dangerous notion , says David Walker , who as comptroller general headed the Government Accountability Office from 1998 to 2008 and who endorsed Mitt Romney for president .
`` I 'm concerned that liberals have misread the election and are overreaching , '' Walker said Tuesday at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce event .
`` There 's actually no question that the president campaigned on more revenues and more [ sacrifice ] from the wealthy . I think it 's legitimate for him to say that , '' said Walker . `` But to say that he has more than that is not credible . And what we 're hearing right now is we 're hearing grand bargain-type numbers on revenues but not grand bargain numbers '' for entitlement reform .
Rep. Steny Hoyer , D-Md. , the second ranking House Democrat , told journalists last week that `` you 've got to put everything on the table '' in talks with Republicans .

Despite his re-election and more Democratic seats in Congress, President Obama has far from a free hand to make the kind of comprehensive deal House Speaker John Boehner and other Republicans are demanding — one that includes cuts to entitlement programs.

Strong resistance to that notion is coming from the political left, including warnings that while Obama won't have another re-election, most of his allies on Capitol Hill will be facing voters again.

""Any benefit cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid have to be off the table,"" said Ilya Sheyman, campaign director for MoveOn.org Civic Action, in an interview. ""I think it's certainly true that no Democratic member of Congress — whether it's in the House or the Senate — should be surprised if they end up facing a primary after voting to cut Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security programs.""

Sheyman said the performance of political progressives in turning out the vote for Democrats in the recent election gives them the right not only to be heard but also to have their demands met that entitlements be left unscathed in negotiations to avert the combination of major tax increases and drastic spending cuts scheduled for the end of the year.

That's a dangerous notion, says David Walker, who as comptroller general headed the Government Accountability Office from 1998 to 2008 and who endorsed Mitt Romney for president.

""I'm concerned that liberals have misread the election and are overreaching,"" Walker said Tuesday at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce event.

""There's actually no question that the president campaigned on more revenues and more [sacrifice] from the wealthy. I think it's legitimate for him to say that,"" said Walker. ""But to say that he has more than that is not credible. And what we're hearing right now is we're hearing grand bargain-type numbers on revenues but not grand bargain numbers"" for entitlement reform.

Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., the second ranking House Democrat, told journalists last week that ""you've got to put everything on the table"" in talks with Republicans.

Even the suggestion got him in hot water, leading to social media demands for House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi to oust Hoyer from leadership. Some activists urged like-minded progressives to raise their voices to get Hoyer to recant.

""Seniors on Medicare did not cause our deficit — Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, two wars and Wall Street's recession did,"" a blog post on BoldProgressives.org argued. ""They should not be asked to pay through their hard-earned benefits.""

As of Tuesday, Hoyer certainly didn't seem to be backing away. He told journalists, according to The Hill:

""I agree that everything's on the table, but that doesn't mean we're for everything,"" he said. ""Some of those are not advisable. ... We need to protect and strengthen Social Security and Medicare.""

Progressive groups aren't the only ones poised to give the blues to any Democratic policymaker willing to discuss entitlement reforms; there's also the ostensibly nonpartisan (and powerful) advocacy group AARP.

""On behalf of our 37 million members and their families, AARP will fight for an open, thoughtful public discussion about how to strengthen Social Security and Medicare, and against cramming changes to these vital programs into a last–minute deal that could harm all of us,"" AARP announced on its website.

The progressive position, as expressed by Sheyman, is that middle-class and working-class families, the hardest hit by the Great Recession, most rely on those entitlement programs and aren't in a position to make more sacrifices — unlike the top 2 percent of taxpayers.

If entitlement changes must be made, some progressives have floated the idea of giving Medicare the ability to negotiate pharmaceutical prices, a power Congress explicitly denied the program when it enacted the Medicare drug benefit in 2003.

Making an already head-splittingly difficult deal on the fiscal cliff even harder to resolve is a set of three rules by which the Republicans who run the House play.

These are not official regulations; they're more shibboleths that House GOP leaders have adopted in recent years. And those rules are leaving House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, little room to maneuver as lawmakers try to avoid a set of tax increases and spending cuts set to take effect at the end of the year.

1. ""The majority of the majority""

According to President Obama, keeping tax rates unchanged for the bottom 98 percent of taxpayers come Jan. 1 should be simple.

The Senate has already passed a bill freezing all but the top two rates of the Bush-era tax cuts, he told a group of factory workers on Friday. ""If we can just get a few House Republicans on board, we can pass the bill in the House, it will land on my desk, and I am ready — I have got a bunch of pens ready — to sign this bill.""

But that Senate bill has been stymied by the House GOP leadership's deference to what's known as ""the majority of the majority."" Under this de facto rule, no bill is brought up for a vote when Republicans control the House unless a majority of their caucus supports it.

""We've got the Republicans now as a parliamentary-style minority. In a parliamentary system, it is just a matter of course that the parties unite together in opposition to the other side,"" he said. ""But you can't function that way with divided government.""

2. Any increase in the debt ceiling must be matched by an equal decrease in spending

With the rise of the Tea Party came this rule governing increases in the nation's borrowing limit — and one has to happen very soon.

Boehner's insistence on such a dollar-for-dollar deal led to last year's debt ceiling crisis; last week he said he'll do the same this time.

""I continue to believe that any increase in the debt limit has to be accompanied by spending reductions that meet or exceed it,"" he said.

Ornstein says that when Boehner became speaker nearly two years ago, he privately warned fellow Republicans they would have to make some concessions as the governing party, especially when it came to raising the debt ceiling.

Boehner's new rule, Ornstein said, is ""a very real change from where he had been initially, and partly reflecting, I think, the reality of his leadership, which is he's got to run a little faster to get out in front of his mob.""

3. No new taxes

After Obama's re-election, Boehner softened this rule a bit, though not enough to accommodate the tax rate increases on the wealthy that the president seeks.

""We're willing to put revenues on the table, but revenues that come from closing loopholes, getting rid of special interest deductions, and not raising rates,"" Boehner said Friday.

Some of the speaker's fellow House Republicans are now saying there's nothing in this rule that keeps them from extending tax cuts for most people now rather than risk all those cuts expiring Jan. 1.

One such Republican is Cole, the deputy whip.

""I don't think in this situation nailing down the Bush tax cuts and making them permanent for 98 percent is somehow a violation,"" he said.

All three rules have left Boehner on the hot seat, Stanford political scientist Bruce Cain said.

""He clearly can't adhere to these rules and cut a deal with Obama, but at the same time, if he breaks these rules he could be undermining his position as leader,"" Cain said. ""So he's in a very difficult position.""

The GOP outline , which came in a letter from House Speaker John A. Boehner and his top lieutenants to Mr. Obama , called for $ 900 billion in cuts to projected entitlement spending and would also use a lower inflation measure to calculate future Social Security benefits .
Mr. Boehner told reporters he was trying to craft a middle-ground starting point after the White House last week proposed what he called a “ la-la-land offer ” that asked for $ 1.6 trillion in new taxes and up to $ 400 billion in potential spending cuts .
“ That couldn ’ t pass the House , couldn ’ t pass the Senate and it was basically the president ’ s budget from last February , ” the Ohio Republican said , referring to legislation that was defeated on unanimous votes in both chambers earlier this year .
The Republicans said they could raise taxes $ 800 billion by ending loopholes for the wealthy rather than raising their income tax rates , but the White House has insisted most of the new money must come from higher rates .
“ The Republican letter released today does not meet the test of balance , ” White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer said . “ Their plan includes nothing new and provides no details on which deductions they would eliminate , which loopholes they will close or which Medicare savings they would achieve . ”
He said Mr. Obama “ is willing to compromise ” but that won ’ t happen until Republicans “ get serious about asking the wealthiest to pay slightly higher tax rates . ”
Both sides are rushing ahead of a year-end deadline to avoid across-the-board tax increases and $ 110 billion in automatic spending cuts , which have been dubbed the fiscal cliff . Together , they would plunge the country into a short , sharp recession , but would leave it in better fiscal and economic shape over the long run , the Congressional Budget Office said .
Lawmakers , though , want to minimize the pain . All sides want to extend the lower tax rates for most Americans , leaving the chief dispute over what happens to the tax cuts for couples making $ 250,000 or more a year .
The GOP made a major concession Monday when Mr. Boehner and his top House Republican allies said they would be willing to accept $ 800 billion in new taxes from those high-income taxpayers .
Republican leaders had said they would be willing to consider revenue but had left it vague whether that money would come from real tax increases or from the economic benefits of expanded growth . On Monday , top congressional aides said it would be real revenue under the definitions of the Congressional Budget Office , which is the official scorekeeper for these matters .
Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio , head of the Republican Study Committee caucus , said he did not know that House leaders planned to roll out their framework for averting the fiscal cliff .
“ My general reaction is the good news is that it is obviously better than the bullet points the president gave , which was ridiculous , ” Mr. Jordan said . “ The bad news is that it is a tax increase and I am not going to vote for a tax increase because it hurts economic growth .
“ If you are going to lower rates and close loopholes and do genuine tax reform , that is one thing because that contributes to economic growth , ” he said . “ But if you are going to raise taxes through closing loopholes , deductions , that is not economic growth . That is just a different way to raise taxes . ”
Grover Norquist , president of Americans for Tax Reform and the man who runs the influential no-new-taxes pledge , had urged the Republicans to hold firm in rejecting any tax increase . An ATR spokesman said the group didn ’ t have enough details Monday to evaluate the plan .
Much of the debate comes down to whether it ’ s possible to squeeze $ 800 billion in revenue out of the wealthy through loopholes alone . Mr. Boehner says it is possible , while Mr. Obama and his allies say it isn ’ t .
Democrats said until Mr. Boehner agrees to rate increases , nothing can be negotiated .
“ Republicans are simply digging in their heels by refusing to ask the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share and actually calling for lower tax rates , ” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said .

The Republicans ’ offer says nothing about Mr. Obama ’ s call for more stimulus spending or about his demand that Congress give up its power to control the federal debt ceiling , which Republicans hope to use to keep an upper limit on spending .","House Republican leaders delivered a $2.2 trillion “fiscal cliff” counteroffer to President Obama on Monday that included $800 billion in tax increases, but the White House and congressional Democrats said that still isn’t enough revenue to begin negotiating.

The GOP outline, which came in a letter from House Speaker John A. Boehner and his top lieutenants to Mr. Obama, called for $900 billion in cuts to projected entitlement spending and would also use a lower inflation measure to calculate future Social Security benefits.

Mr. Boehner told reporters he was trying to craft a middle-ground starting point after the White House last week proposed what he called a “la-la-land offer” that asked for $1.6 trillion in new taxes and up to $400 billion in potential spending cuts.

“That couldn’t pass the House, couldn’t pass the Senate and it was basically the president’s budget from last February,” the Ohio Republican said, referring to legislation that was defeated on unanimous votes in both chambers earlier this year.

The Republicans said they could raise taxes $800 billion by ending loopholes for the wealthy rather than raising their income tax rates, but the White House has insisted most of the new money must come from higher rates.

“The Republican letter released today does not meet the test of balance,” White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer said. “Their plan includes nothing new and provides no details on which deductions they would eliminate, which loopholes they will close or which Medicare savings they would achieve.”

He said Mr. Obama “is willing to compromise” but that won’t happen until Republicans “get serious about asking the wealthiest to pay slightly higher tax rates.”

Both sides are rushing ahead of a year-end deadline to avoid across-the-board tax increases and $110 billion in automatic spending cuts, which have been dubbed the fiscal cliff. Together, they would plunge the country into a short, sharp recession, but would leave it in better fiscal and economic shape over the long run, the Congressional Budget Office said.

Lawmakers, though, want to minimize the pain. All sides want to extend the lower tax rates for most Americans, leaving the chief dispute over what happens to the tax cuts for couples making $250,000 or more a year.

The GOP made a major concession Monday when Mr. Boehner and his top House Republican allies said they would be willing to accept $800 billion in new taxes from those high-income taxpayers.

Republican leaders had said they would be willing to consider revenue but had left it vague whether that money would come from real tax increases or from the economic benefits of expanded growth. On Monday, top congressional aides said it would be real revenue under the definitions of the Congressional Budget Office, which is the official scorekeeper for these matters.

The new stance surprised some key Republicans.

Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, head of the Republican Study Committee caucus, said he did not know that House leaders planned to roll out their framework for averting the fiscal cliff.

“My general reaction is the good news is that it is obviously better than the bullet points the president gave, which was ridiculous,” Mr. Jordan said. “The bad news is that it is a tax increase and I am not going to vote for a tax increase because it hurts economic growth.

“If you are going to lower rates and close loopholes and do genuine tax reform, that is one thing because that contributes to economic growth,” he said. “But if you are going to raise taxes through closing loopholes, deductions, that is not economic growth. That is just a different way to raise taxes.”

Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform and the man who runs the influential no-new-taxes pledge, had urged the Republicans to hold firm in rejecting any tax increase. An ATR spokesman said the group didn’t have enough details Monday to evaluate the plan.

Much of the debate comes down to whether it’s possible to squeeze $800 billion in revenue out of the wealthy through loopholes alone. Mr. Boehner says it is possible, while Mr. Obama and his allies say it isn’t.

Democrats said until Mr. Boehner agrees to rate increases, nothing can be negotiated.

“Republicans are simply digging in their heels by refusing to ask the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share and actually calling for lower tax rates,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said.

The Republican offer comes five days after Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner met with congressional leaders and laid out broad targets that included $1.6 trillion in new tax increases, and hundreds of billions in new stimulus spending and extended benefits for the unemployed.

Mr. Boehner said the last time he talked personally with Mr. Obama was Wednesday, though the two sides hinted they could talk on the sidelines of the White House holiday ball Monday night.

The GOP plan doesn’t lay out specific tax increases or spending cuts but instead gives broad goals to achieve the $2.2 trillion in lower deficits over the next decade: $800 billion in revenue, $600 billion in lower projected health spending, $300 billion from other entitlements, $200 billion by lowering automatic increases in spending and benefits, and another $300 billion from annual discretionary spending.

The Republicans’ offer says nothing about Mr. Obama’s call for more stimulus spending or about his demand that Congress give up its power to control the federal debt ceiling, which Republicans hope to use to keep an upper limit on spending.

President Barack Obama and congressional Republican leaders are finally prepared to open negotiations this week on the fiscal cliff — an all-important legislative riddle with no easy answers.

Democrats want to increase tax rates; Republicans say no way. Republicans seek major changes to entitlement programs; Democrats are divided. Republicans want to nullify a package of automatic spending cuts; Democrats won’t go for it without major concessions.

Story Continued Below

The policy differences are endless, but the scenarios for how it could play out are fairly limited. Here are five ways Congress may navigate the labyrinth:

1. Go over the cliff

In gridlocked Washington, this outcome is not only possible, it’s the preference of some in both parties.

Consider the reasons, from the practical to the political.

There just isn’t a lot of time before Jan. 1. Congress returns this week but then leaves town for Thanksgiving. After returning from that break, lawmakers will have only four weeks to strike a compromise on issues that have confounded the parties for years.

Congress usually delivers only when it’s up against a deadline, but if lawmakers do so now they could be viewed as jamming a complex bill into law without much scrutiny.

House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has said he doesn’t want retiring and defeated lawmakers to vote on major legislation during the lame-duck session. He would rather temporarily extend all of the tax rates to allow more time next year to overhaul the Tax Code. But Democrats don’t want to renew the rates for the top earners, even for a few months.

Even if the two sides can come to an agreement on how to handle income tax rates, they’ll have to develop a framework for comprehensive tax reform — and there’s almost no agreement on what that should look like.

While this debate is raging, Congress also has to deal with other items that aren’t getting a lot of attention but could cause big problems. The pricey alternative minimum tax, which will hit millions of upper-middle-class families, needs to be patched. House Republican leaders want to extend the nation’s farm policy. Corporate tax breaks are about to expire. There’s also the debt ceiling, which will need to be raised in early 2013. And don’t forget the automatic spending cuts to the Pentagon and domestic programs — known as the sequester — which both parties want to avoid but need to find a way to pay for.

Top Democrats see a strategic advantage in letting the rates lapse. The logic is that, once taxes rise Jan. 1, lawmakers would then be able to say they voted to cut taxes. This could make it easier to attract Republicans who may otherwise feel locked into Grover Norquist’s no-tax-hike pledge.

Another incentive for Senate Democrats is that they are expected to pick up two seats in the next Congress, giving them a slightly larger majority to negotiate a more favorable deal.

The economy could drop into a recession by the end of next year if nothing is done.

fiscal_cliff,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/dec/30/gop-backs-off-social-security-income-change/,GOP backs off Social Security income change ,2012-12-30,Stephen Dinan,"Republicans on Sunday conceded on their demand that any “ fiscal cliff ” deal trim Social Security cost-of-living increases , signaling the end — for now — of their push to reform entitlements in exchange for higher tax rates .
Proponents said they might try to revisit the issue next year , but senators from both parties said they were playing a losing hand when they appeared to be demanding cuts to the federal government ’ s public pensions program in exchange for protecting tax rates for families making more than $ 250,000 .
“ I ’ m not a fan of affecting those who are currently on Social Security — especially the more elderly , ” said Sen. Olympia J. Snowe , Maine Republican . “ That ’ ll probably be part of a larger debate in conjunction with the debt ceiling next year , and other issues regarding entitlement reform . ”
Social Security emerged as a last-minute stumbling block Sunday when Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , Nevada Democrat , went to the chamber floor and said he had hit an impasse with Republicans over the issue . He said his party would consider cost-of-living changes at some point in the future , but ruled it out as part of the smaller deal he and Sen. Mitch McConnell , Kentucky Republican , were negotiating .
“ We ’ re not going to have any Social Security cuts , ” he said flatly .
Deleting Social Security from the equation means Republicans now are fighting a strictly defensive battle and the fiscal cliff debate centers around how much taxes are going to go up , and on what spending will be added — such as another extension of unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless .
Some Republicans said the demand was just a bargaining chip they were expecting to drop , while others questioned whether it was even on the table .
“ That ’ s the first I ’ ve heard of it on the floor , ” said Sen. Lindsey Graham , South Carolina Republican , adding that he wanted to save that fight for another day .
For Democrats , cutting into entitlement programs is anathema — similar to the way Republicans see tax increases .
But in the wake of Mr. Obama ’ s re-election and Democrats ’ gains in Congress , Republicans have been forced to cave on their tax principles , while Democrats have been able to hold firm in defending entitlements .
At issue is the measure of inflation used to calculate inflation . Most federal programs are tied to the Consumer Price Index , but Republicans want to use what is called Chained CPI , which would lead to lower cost-of-living adjustments .
The Congressional Budget Office projects that would mean a quarter of a percentage point slower growth per year , which could add up over the decades .
Mr. Obama signaled early in fiscal cliff negotiations that he could accept using Chained CPI as long as protections were in place for those with the lowest incomes .
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California disputed the views of other Democrats who called it a benefit cut .
“ No . I consider it a strengthening of Social Security , ” she told reporters in mid-December .
Democrats said they would accept it only as part of a broad deal and that the package being considered this weekend didn ’ t qualify .
Liberal interest groups , who had rallied their supporters to call congressional offices and oppose Chained CPI , cheered their win .
“ Today ’ s victory shows that activism works , ” said the Progressive Change Campaign Committee , which vowed to field primary challengers to run against any Democrat voting for the proposed policy .","Republicans on Sunday conceded on their demand that any “fiscal cliff” deal trim Social Security cost-of-living increases, signaling the end — for now — of their push to reform entitlements in exchange for higher tax rates.

Social Security emerged as a last-minute stumbling block Sunday when Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, went to the chamber floor and said he had hit an impasse with Republicans over the issue. He said his party would consider cost-of-living changes at some point in the future, but ruled it out as part of the smaller deal he and Sen. Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, were negotiating.

“We’re not going to have any Social Security cuts,” he said flatly.

Deleting Social Security from the equation means Republicans now are fighting a strictly defensive battle and the fiscal cliff debate centers around how much taxes are going to go up, and on what spending will be added — such as another extension of unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless.

Some Republicans said the demand was just a bargaining chip they were expecting to drop, while others questioned whether it was even on the table.

“That’s the first I’ve heard of it on the floor,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, adding that he wanted to save that fight for another day.

For Democrats, cutting into entitlement programs is anathema — similar to the way Republicans see tax increases.

But in the wake of Mr. Obama’s re-election and Democrats’ gains in Congress, Republicans have been forced to cave on their tax principles, while Democrats have been able to hold firm in defending entitlements.

At issue is the measure of inflation used to calculate inflation. Most federal programs are tied to the Consumer Price Index, but Republicans want to use what is called Chained CPI, which would lead to lower cost-of-living adjustments.

The Congressional Budget Office projects that would mean a quarter of a percentage point slower growth per year, which could add up over the decades.

Mr. Obama signaled early in fiscal cliff negotiations that he could accept using Chained CPI as long as protections were in place for those with the lowest incomes.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California disputed the views of other Democrats who called it a benefit cut.

“No. I consider it a strengthening of Social Security,” she told reporters in mid-December.

Democrats said they would accept it only as part of a broad deal and that the package being considered this weekend didn’t qualify.

Liberal interest groups, who had rallied their supporters to call congressional offices and oppose Chained CPI, cheered their win.

“Today’s victory shows that activism works,” said the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which vowed to field primary challengers to run against any Democrat voting for the proposed policy.

The Bush administration tax cuts -- already extended by two years -- are set to expire at the end of 2012 . In addition , spending cuts Congress approved during the Republican-led standoff over raising the federal debt ceiling in 2011 will start kicking in at the same time , cutting $ 1 trillion over 10 years . Those would be coupled with other cuts , such as the end of a 2-percentage-point cut in Social Security payroll taxes and extended unemployment benefits for many jobless workers , according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget office .
The non-partisan Tax Policy Center estimates middle-class families would pay about $ 2,000 a year more in taxes , or about 4 % . The the top 1 % of taxpayers would see their tax bills go up around 7 % , or about $ 120,000 . Those increases , along with spending cuts , would cut the projected federal budget deficit nearly in half -- but it would also threaten millions of jobs , especially those dependent on government contracting , and risk a return to recession , the CBO found .

Republicans have said they are willing to raise revenue by closing tax loopholes and ending deductions , but have resisted raising rates . More than 230 GOP representatives and 40 senators have pledged to oppose tax increases , and the man behind that pledge -- conservative activist Grover Norquist -- told reporters he hoped Congress and the administration would extend the Bush tax cuts a second time .

Kleinbard : But the dilemma of fiscal cliff is more apparent than real
He advocates a three-year transition from current policies to a more sustainable mix
Kleinbard : We can do it without being sure what the new taxing and spending rules will be
America 's fiscal policy faces an apparent Hobson 's choice . On the one hand , we need to tame federal deficit spending by imposing new across-the-board spending cuts and higher taxes . We are told that if we do not act on this soon , the debt markets will choke on the overabundance of government debt issued to fund those deficits , causing interest rates to climb . As a result , businesses and homeowners will be unable to borrow on reasonable terms , which will lead to a slowdown of the economy .
On the other hand , we also are told that allowing this deficit reduction program actually to take effect in 2013 would precipitate a new recession .
Faced with two genuinely unpalatable courses of action , it 's no wonder that Washington struggles to find a consensus .
But , the dilemma is more apparent than real , because it confounds the dimension of time .
What we need to do is to commit today to a transition -- a ramp -- from our current taxing and spending policies to a more sustainable mix . A firm congressional commitment , for example , to a three-year ramp , by means of which we move to a sensible combination of higher taxes and lower spending , should enable the economy to heal while reassuring markets that the long-term fiscal health of the country will be restored .
Of course , advocating a three-year transition from where we are to where we need to be is the easy part . The real challenge is to identify the new policies .
A bona fide `` grand bargain '' might need to encompass as much as $ 8 trillion in lower spending and higher taxes over 10 years to address fully the underlying fiscal trends , not the much smaller numbers currently bandied about . Figuring out how to do that will be extremely painful for Congress , because regardless of party affiliation , members like to give more than they like to take away .
The genuine difficulty of defining the new mix of taxing and spending policies that will apply at the end of the ramping-up period means that negotiations will take a great deal of time . But our dilemma reminds us that we do not have the luxury of time to thrash out all the components of this sustainable path , if we are to avoid an immediate recession .

We have to define the ramp to a new fiscal policy without being sure exactly what those new taxing and spending rules will be . This sounds impossible : How do you build an off ramp from a highway to connect to another road that does not exist and has not yet even been mapped ?
There is a way to do just that . First , let all the Bush tax cuts and other temporary tax discounts expire ( which is what legislative inaction will trigger on January 1 ) , but phase in the expiration of the Bush tax cuts over three years ( so that a third of the extra tax bite is added each year ) . At the same time , repeal the $ 1 trillion of new across-the-board spending cuts ( the `` sequestration '' ) to which Congress committed itself when the budget `` supercommittee '' failed .
These two steps define the ramp . The repeal of the spending cuts adds to the deficit but is far outweighed over time by the incremental taxes that would be raised if all the Bush tax cuts expired .
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects that those higher tax revenues largely solve the deficit problem over the next 10 years or more . The resulting tax system can simultaneously be improved , for example by eliminating the hated Alternative Minimum Tax , without any further revenue costs through a few surgical strokes I have advocated before

Kleinbard: But the dilemma of fiscal cliff is more apparent than real

He advocates a three-year transition from current policies to a more sustainable mix

Kleinbard: We can do it without being sure what the new taxing and spending rules will be

America's fiscal policy faces an apparent Hobson's choice. On the one hand, we need to tame federal deficit spending by imposing new across-the-board spending cuts and higher taxes. We are told that if we do not act on this soon, the debt markets will choke on the overabundance of government debt issued to fund those deficits, causing interest rates to climb. As a result, businesses and homeowners will be unable to borrow on reasonable terms, which will lead to a slowdown of the economy.

On the other hand, we also are told that allowing this deficit reduction program actually to take effect in 2013 would precipitate a new recession.

Faced with two genuinely unpalatable courses of action, it's no wonder that Washington struggles to find a consensus.

Edward D. Kleinbard

But, the dilemma is more apparent than real, because it confounds the dimension of time.

What we need to do is to commit today to a transition -- a ramp -- from our current taxing and spending policies to a more sustainable mix. A firm congressional commitment, for example, to a three-year ramp, by means of which we move to a sensible combination of higher taxes and lower spending, should enable the economy to heal while reassuring markets that the long-term fiscal health of the country will be restored.

Of course, advocating a three-year transition from where we are to where we need to be is the easy part. The real challenge is to identify the new policies.

A bona fide ""grand bargain"" might need to encompass as much as $8 trillion in lower spending and higher taxes over 10 years to address fully the underlying fiscal trends, not the much smaller numbers currently bandied about. Figuring out how to do that will be extremely painful for Congress, because regardless of party affiliation, members like to give more than they like to take away.

The genuine difficulty of defining the new mix of taxing and spending policies that will apply at the end of the ramping-up period means that negotiations will take a great deal of time. But our dilemma reminds us that we do not have the luxury of time to thrash out all the components of this sustainable path, if we are to avoid an immediate recession.

We have to define the ramp to a new fiscal policy without being sure exactly what those new taxing and spending rules will be. This sounds impossible: How do you build an off ramp from a highway to connect to another road that does not exist and has not yet even been mapped?

There is a way to do just that. First, let all the Bush tax cuts and other temporary tax discounts expire (which is what legislative inaction will trigger on January 1), but phase in the expiration of the Bush tax cuts over three years (so that a third of the extra tax bite is added each year). At the same time, repeal the $1 trillion of new across-the-board spending cuts (the ""sequestration"") to which Congress committed itself when the budget ""supercommittee"" failed.

These two steps define the ramp. The repeal of the spending cuts adds to the deficit but is far outweighed over time by the incremental taxes that would be raised if all the Bush tax cuts expired.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects that those higher tax revenues largely solve the deficit problem over the next 10 years or more. The resulting tax system can simultaneously be improved, for example by eliminating the hated Alternative Minimum Tax, without any further revenue costs through a few surgical strokes I have advocated before

Then, let Congress do what it does best, which is to cut taxes starting three years from now -- but with a catch. The deal must be that Congress bind itself in advance automatically to apply new spending cuts (compared with the budget office's projections) to tax rate rollbacks. So, for every $1 billion reduction in government spending, Americans' tax bills automatically would be cut by $1 billion.

Those tax rate rollbacks should start with the lowest tax bracket first. The reason for this ordering is that all taxpayers, rich and poor alike, get the benefit of the lower tax brackets on their income in that bracket. By buying down tax rates from the bottom up, the proposal shares the savings from new government spending cuts across the broadest possible number of Americans.

Under this proposal, the ramp up to a sustainable budget would be set in advance (through the three-year staged repeal of all the Bush tax cuts), as would the way to lighten the load without deviating from the path's ultimate goal of fiscal sustainability (through spending cuts automatically applied to buying down those scheduled tax rate hikes).

Given this opportunity, both parties will have strong incentives to agree to spending cuts, because each net spending reduction will bring new tax relief to constituents. If Congress enacts large enough spending cuts, all the tax rate hikes would automatically roll back.

Over time, Congress will reach a balance between new taxes and reduced spending through negotiations that offer members a positive reward -- tax relief -- to counterbalance the bitter pill of spending cuts. But the key is that those scalebacks in government spending programs do not have to be identified before this Christmas; as each is enacted in the months or even years to come, the automatic mechanism would deliver tax rate rollbacks to Americans.

When they leaked it to reporters on Thursday, House Republicans deemed the White House offer to avert the ""fiscal cliff"" to be a ""joke,"" an ""insult"" and ""a complete break from reality."" The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, let it be known that he ""burst into laughter"" when he heard the plan, which included $1.6 trillion in tax increases and $400 billion in future, unspecified spending cuts.



""It was not a serious proposal,"" House Speaker John Boehner said Friday.

There is some truth to that. Mr. Obama's initial ask goes far beyond what could ever pass the GOP-led House; it reflects Mr. Obama's budget priorities, which come nowhere close to the priorities of House Republicans. It does not reflect an effort to compromise.

Yet Boehner's criticism of the president's proposal also applies to himself and his colleagues. Neither side has offered up a plan that comes close to what could realistically pass both houses of Congress. Boehner, in fact, has offered no plan at all: When he is pressed by reporters on his position, he says to look to the House Republican budgets to understand what his side is seeking. When Rep. Tiberi, R-Ohio, was asked about the apparent lack of a GOP ""fiscal cliff"" offer on Medicare, he responded, ""we passed a Medicare plan in our budget.""

Republicans are thus arguing that the controversial budgets spearheaded by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., are effectively their proposal. And the Ryan budget, with its deep cuts to entitlements and other spending, has the same chance of getting through the Senate as the Obama proposal has getting through the House: Zero. If the Obama proposal is a ""joke,"" then the Republican proposal is the exact same joke.

Here's the reality: Despite the fact that the ""fiscal cliff"" deadline is just a month away, the two sides have yet to get serious about coming to an agreement, at least publicly. (It's anyone's guess what's happening behind closed doors - despite leaks from both sides that have fed speculative news stories, there is no evidence that either side has yet made major concessions.) They are effectively at the beginning of negotiations, with each player posturing in an effort to improve his position before the real deal-making begins.

Both sides know that the positions they are publicly insisting on are not serious. Any talk about a willingness to be conciliatory - Boehner said today that ""Republicans are not seeking to impose our will on the president,"" while the president said ""all of us are going to have to get out of our comfort zones"" - simply does not square with their current position in the ""fiscal cliff"" negotiations.

House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi on Thursday criticized Boehner's posturing as a ""tactic."" She's right. But she left out the fact that Mr. Obama's offer is a tactic as well. Think of it this way: You want to buy a car that is worth $5,000. You offer $1,000. The seller counters with $20,000. That's about where things stand at the moment in the ""fiscal cliff"" fight.

This is not a new script. It's how Washington works. Whether it was the battle over health care or standoffs over government shutdowns, partisans have regularly staked out ostensibly immovable positions before (in most cases) finding their way to compromise. What does it take to get there? For starters, a deadline. In Washington, a month is a relative lifetime. Lawmakers tend not to get down to serious business until the moment of truth -- in this case going over the ""fiscal cliff"" -- is nearly at hand. (In this case, the deadline has been blurred somewhat by the fact that some lawmakers say they are willing to go over the ""cliff,"" in part because it's actually more of a slope.)

The small business he founded a decade ago has grown steadily since the recession , employing 21 workers on several production lines .
But now , with a tax hike on the horizon as part of a deficit-reduction deal as envisioned by President Obama and the Democrats , it may become more difficult to expand his business and hire , Curliss says .
`` What it absolutely means is less cash for growth in my business , '' he told ███ . `` In the worst-case scenario , it means we let someone go or have to reduce benefits . ''
Curliss is among an estimated 940,000 Americans who will report more than $ 200,000 in business income on their individual tax returns in 2013 and pay at the top marginal rates , according to the bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation .
They are now at the center of the political storm over the `` fiscal cliff '' and debate on whether to raise top income tax rates at the end of the year .
Obama wants the two upper tax brackets to rise from 33 and 35 percent to 36 and 39.6 percent , respectively . Republicans staunchly oppose any increase , largely citing the impact on companies like Curliss ' .
Performance Polymer Solutions , like thousands of small businesses , is structured as a so-called `` pass-through '' entity with the firm 's income and profits passed directly to Curliss for reporting on his 1040 . The company itself does not pay taxes .
On paper , the extra cash makes Curliss look like a rich man , subjecting his income to the top rates . Yet , he never actually sees the business income in his paycheck , he says . Instead , the money is kept inside the business to help it grow .
`` Raising the top rates means there will be less cash in my company to reinvest in employees and benefits and equipment , '' he said .
Democrats , defending the need for revenue from the top 2 percent of U.S. income earners to help close the budget gap , say cases like Curliss ' are the exception not the rule .
`` Ninety-seven percent of small businesses would not see any increases in their income taxes , '' Obama said Thursday . `` And even folks who make more than $ 250,000 would still have a tax break for their incomes up to $ 250,000 . ''
Just 3 percent of more than 30 million Americans who report business income on their personal returns next year will pay at the top marginal rates , the Joint Committee found .
Many of them , colloquially referred to as `` business owners , '' include independent doctors , lawyers and hedge fund managers whose companies are set up as `` pass-through '' entities with high incomes and few employees .
Experts say the vast majority of businesses paying taxes through the individual code are very small , make very little money and do n't come remotely close to having to pay higher taxes if Obama gets his way .
The average income of a business that reports on an individual tax return is about $ 40,000 , according to the Tax Policy Center .
`` Most of these are sole proprietorships and their number of employees is zero , '' said Howard Gleckman , an analyst with the Center , noting that self-employed taxpayers include babysitters , plumbers and investors .
`` All things equal , the lower the taxes , the better off we all are , '' Gleckman said . `` The trade-off , though , is that if you believe the budget deficit is a big economic problem , and if you believe that the ultimate consequence of ongoing high deficits is higher interest rates , well then that 's a cost , too . ''
Allowing the Bush-era tax cuts to expire for individuals earning more than $ 200,000 a year and families making $ 250,000 a year would raise $ 836 billion over the next decade , according to the White House .
The national debt currently exceeds $ 16 trillion . During each of the first four years of Obama 's term , the federal budget deficit topped $ 1 trillion .
Increasing tax rates on upper-income earners will make little dent in a mountain of debt while undermining job creation at the same time , Republicans say .
They point to research by the Joint Committee on Taxation that shows Curliss and the 940,000 top-end filers with business income account for 53 percent of the total $ 1.3 trillion in all business income reported by more than 30 million filers across the U.S .
`` Raising taxes on small businesses is only going to make it harder for our economy to grow , '' said House Speaker John Boehner last week . `` And if our economy does n't grow , Americans do n't get new jobs , and the debt problem that we have will continue to threaten our children 's future. ``
Republicans also cite a study by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office last month which found a small but measureable impact on jobs and economic growth if the existing top tax cuts are allowed to expire .
Higher rates on the top 2 percent of earners would mean 0.1 percent slower annual growth in GDP and the creation of 200,000 fewer jobs than would occur if current rates were extended , CBO found . Progressives call the impact `` minimal . ''
Curliss said regardless of the numbers , his business will be challenged by higher rates , possibly sidelining a budding opportunity to expand production with another Ohio company .
`` It takes cash to develop new business opportunities , '' he said . `` It takes cash to put in new manufacturing equipment . ''
`` If somebody 's going to tell you they 're going to take more money away from you that ca n't do anything but frustrate you when you 're trying to grow business and create job opportunities for people , '' he said .

Democrats, defending the need for revenue from the top 2 percent of U.S. income earners to help close the budget gap, say cases like Curliss' are the exception not the rule.

""Ninety-seven percent of small businesses would not see any increases in their income taxes,"" Obama said Thursday. ""And even folks who make more than $250,000 would still have a tax break for their incomes up to $250,000.""

Just 3 percent of more than 30 million Americans who report business income on their personal returns next year will pay at the top marginal rates, the Joint Committee found.

Many of them, colloquially referred to as ""business owners,"" include independent doctors, lawyers and hedge fund managers whose companies are set up as ""pass-through"" entities with high incomes and few employees.

Experts say the vast majority of businesses paying taxes through the individual code are very small, make very little money and don't come remotely close to having to pay higher taxes if Obama gets his way.

The average income of a business that reports on an individual tax return is about $40,000, according to the Tax Policy Center.

""Most of these are sole proprietorships and their number of employees is zero,"" said Howard Gleckman, an analyst with the Center, noting that self-employed taxpayers include babysitters, plumbers and investors.

""All things equal, the lower the taxes, the better off we all are,"" Gleckman said. ""The trade-off, though, is that if you believe the budget deficit is a big economic problem, and if you believe that the ultimate consequence of ongoing high deficits is higher interest rates, well then that's a cost, too.""

Allowing the Bush-era tax cuts to expire for individuals earning more than $200,000 a year and families making $250,000 a year would raise $836 billion over the next decade, according to the White House.

The national debt currently exceeds $16 trillion. During each of the first four years of Obama's term, the federal budget deficit topped $1 trillion.

Increasing tax rates on upper-income earners will make little dent in a mountain of debt while undermining job creation at the same time, Republicans say.

They point to research by the Joint Committee on Taxation that shows Curliss and the 940,000 top-end filers with business income account for 53 percent of the total $1.3 trillion in all business income reported by more than 30 million filers across the U.S.

""Raising taxes on small businesses is only going to make it harder for our economy to grow,"" said House Speaker John Boehner last week. ""And if our economy doesn't grow, Americans don't get new jobs, and the debt problem that we have will continue to threaten our children's future. ""

Republicans also cite a study by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office last month which found a small but measureable impact on jobs and economic growth if the existing top tax cuts are allowed to expire.

Higher rates on the top 2 percent of earners would mean 0.1 percent slower annual growth in GDP and the creation of 200,000 fewer jobs than would occur if current rates were extended, CBO found. Progressives call the impact ""minimal.""

Curliss said regardless of the numbers, his business will be challenged by higher rates, possibly sidelining a budding opportunity to expand production with another Ohio company.

""It takes cash to develop new business opportunities,"" he said. ""It takes cash to put in new manufacturing equipment.""

""If somebody's going to tell you they're going to take more money away from you that can't do anything but frustrate you when you're trying to grow business and create job opportunities for people,"" he said.

The stock market's unpredictability is perhaps the biggest wild card in the political showdown over the fiscal cliff.



President Barack Obama's re-election gives him a strong negotiating hand, as Republicans are increasingly acknowledging. And some Democrats are willing to let the Dec. 31 deadline pass, because a rash of broad-based tax hikes would pressure Republicans to give more ground in renewed deficit-reduction negotiations.



A chief fear for Obama's supporters, however, is that Wall Street would be so disgusted or dismayed that stocks would plummet before lawmakers could prove their newfound willingness to mitigate the fiscal cliff's harshest measures, including deep, across-the-board spending cuts that Defense Secretary Leon Panetta says could significantly damage the nation's military posture. Some Republicans believe that fear will temper the president's insistence on a hard bargain this month. Obama and GOP House Speaker John Boehner on Sunday held their first meeting between just the two of them since the election, and spokesmen for both emphasized afterward their lines of communication remain open.



The so-called cliff's recipe of major tax hikes and spending cuts can actually be a gentle slope, because the policy changes would be phased in over time. Washington insiders say Congress and the White House would move quickly in January or February to undo many, but not all, of the tax hikes and spending cuts.



Financial markets, however, respond to emotion as well as to research, reason and promises.

Some Republicans are surprised that the White House has not made clearer efforts to reassure Wall Street that if the Dec. 31 deadline is breached, the worrisome pile of tax increases and spending cuts would not hit all at once.

House Speaker John Boehner was dealt a major defeat Thursday night. After spending most of the week trying to round up votes for his ""Plan B"" to extend tax cuts for virtually everyone, he pulled the measure without a vote and sent the House home for Christmas. The clock keeps ticking toward the end of the year, when automatic tax increases and spending cuts are set to hit.

Well , here we are . It 's New Year 's Eve and with just hours to go before the end of the year and the arrival of the so-called fiscal cliff , Democrats and Republicans in Washington are still trying to strike a deal that heads off automatic increases in taxes , automatic deep spending cuts in a variety of programs and the automatic expiration of some jobless benefits .
As host David Greene said on Morning Edition , `` we still do not know if taxes will be going up as the ball in New York City 's Times Square goes down . ''
But , at least lawmakers have n't left things until the last minute , David said ( with his tongue firmly planted in his cheek ) . After all , `` we 've got hours and hours before the last minute . ''
The two leaders at the center of the talks now are Vice President Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , who will try to come up with some sort of deal before the Senate reconvenes later this morning . If they can , and if such a deal is passed by the Senate , then the House might also take it up today .
As you can see , though , there are several big `` ifs '' in such a scenario .
The good news , if there is any : As NPR 's Scott Horsley pointed out on Morning Edition , going over the cliff is n't `` an instant catastrophe . '' The `` $ 500 billion hit to the economy '' it would deliver is spread over a year and `` many of those effects could be reversed '' by later legislation , he said .
The continued uncertainty , though , is rattling the world 's financial markets .
We 'll watch how this all plays out as the day continues .
Update at 2:05 p.m . ET . On Taxes , Obama Says Agreement Is `` In Sight '' :
The president just told the nation that his top priority — preventing an increase in taxes for most Americans — is within sight . We live-blogged as he spoke .
Update at 1:10 p.m . ET . We 'll Follow The President 's Comments :
There 's a fresh post here where we 'll post updates on what President Obama says during an appearance at the White House set for 1:30 p.m . ET .
The White House just alerted reporters that at 1:30 p.m . ET , `` the president will deliver remarks about the fiscal cliff at a White House event . ''
`` Stocks were on track to break a five-session losing streak in the final trading day of 2012 , even as the year-end fiscal-cliff deadline looms , '' The Wall Street Journal writes .
`` We 're seeing an underlying pressure for the market to move up , based on fundamentals like reasonable valuations , '' Adrian Day , president of Adrian Day Asset Management told the Journal . `` That 's offset by the fiscal cliff ... [ but ] there 's also a realization that going over the fiscal cliff would n't necessarily be a disaster . ''
Update at 11:30 a.m . ET . Outlines Of A Deal On Taxes ?
`` On taxes , one of the thorniest issues on the table , the two sides appeared to be converging . President Barack Obama has called for raising individual income-tax rates on family income above $ 250,000 . In the latest round of Senate talks , Republicans proposed a $ 550,000 threshold , which Democrats moved to $ 450,000 , according to Sen. Dick Durbin ( D. , Ill. ) . ''
`` McConnell and Biden , who served in the Senate together for 23 years , are closing in on an agreement that would hike tax rates for families who earn more than $ 450,000 , and individuals who make more than $ 400,000 , according to sources familiar with talks . That would mark significant concessions for both men , particularly for McConnell . President Barack Obama campaigned on raising taxes for families who make more than $ 250,000 , but McConnell has long been dead-set against any tax increases , warning they would jeopardize the economy . ''
`` Before noon on Monday , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D. , Nev. ) said on the Senate floor that discussions continue , but he also warned 'we really are running out of time , ' adding that 'There are a number of issues on which the two sides are still apart . ' ``
Update at 10:15 a.m . ET . Biden , McConnell Talked Late And Early :
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , told reporters this morning that he and Vice President Biden spoke at 12:45 a.m . ET before going to bed and again at 6:30 a.m . ET after rising . So the negotiations continue .
`` Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) and Vice President Joe Biden engaged in furious overnight negotiations to avert the fiscal cliff and made major progress toward a year-end tax deal , giving sudden hope to high-stakes talks that had been on the brink of collapse , according to sources familiar with the discussion .

(Scroll down for updates.)

Well, here we are. It's New Year's Eve and with just hours to go before the end of the year and the arrival of the so-called fiscal cliff, Democrats and Republicans in Washington are still trying to strike a deal that heads off automatic increases in taxes, automatic deep spending cuts in a variety of programs and the automatic expiration of some jobless benefits.

As host David Greene said on Morning Edition, ""we still do not know if taxes will be going up as the ball in New York City's Times Square goes down.""

But, at least lawmakers haven't left things until the last minute, David said (with his tongue firmly planted in his cheek). After all, ""we've got hours and hours before the last minute.""

The two leaders at the center of the talks now are Vice President Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who will try to come up with some sort of deal before the Senate reconvenes later this morning. If they can, and if such a deal is passed by the Senate, then the House might also take it up today.

As you can see, though, there are several big ""ifs"" in such a scenario.

From 'Morning Edition': Scott Horsley reports Listen

The good news, if there is any: As NPR's Scott Horsley pointed out on Morning Edition, going over the cliff isn't ""an instant catastrophe."" The ""$500 billion hit to the economy"" it would deliver is spread over a year and ""many of those effects could be reversed"" by later legislation, he said.

The continued uncertainty, though, is rattling the world's financial markets.

We'll watch how this all plays out as the day continues.

From 'Morning Edition': David Welna reports Listen

Update at 2:05 p.m. ET. On Taxes, Obama Says Agreement Is ""In Sight"":

The president just told the nation that his top priority — preventing an increase in taxes for most Americans — is within sight. We live-blogged as he spoke.

Update at 1:10 p.m. ET. We'll Follow The President's Comments:

There's a fresh post here where we'll post updates on what President Obama says during an appearance at the White House set for 1:30 p.m. ET.

Update at 12:40 p.m. ET. Obama To Speak:

The White House just alerted reporters that at 1:30 p.m. ET, ""the president will deliver remarks about the fiscal cliff at a White House event.""

Update at 12:15 p.m. ET. Stocks Holding Their Own:

""Stocks were on track to break a five-session losing streak in the final trading day of 2012, even as the year-end fiscal-cliff deadline looms,"" The Wall Street Journal writes.

Why?

""We're seeing an underlying pressure for the market to move up, based on fundamentals like reasonable valuations,"" Adrian Day, president of Adrian Day Asset Management told the Journal. ""That's offset by the fiscal cliff ... [but] there's also a realization that going over the fiscal cliff wouldn't necessarily be a disaster.""

Update at 11:30 a.m. ET. Outlines Of A Deal On Taxes?

The Wall Street Journal says:

""On taxes, one of the thorniest issues on the table, the two sides appeared to be converging. President Barack Obama has called for raising individual income-tax rates on family income above $250,000. In the latest round of Senate talks, Republicans proposed a $550,000 threshold, which Democrats moved to $450,000, according to Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.).""

While Politico reports that:

""McConnell and Biden, who served in the Senate together for 23 years, are closing in on an agreement that would hike tax rates for families who earn more than $450,000, and individuals who make more than $400,000, according to sources familiar with talks. That would mark significant concessions for both men, particularly for McConnell. President Barack Obama campaigned on raising taxes for families who make more than $250,000, but McConnell has long been dead-set against any tax increases, warning they would jeopardize the economy.""

As the Journal adds, though:

""Before noon on Monday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) said on the Senate floor that discussions continue, but he also warned 'we really are running out of time,' adding that 'There are a number of issues on which the two sides are still apart.' ""

Update at 10:15 a.m. ET. Biden, McConnell Talked Late And Early:

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters this morning that he and Vice President Biden spoke at 12:45 a.m. ET before going to bed and again at 6:30 a.m. ET after rising. So the negotiations continue.

Update at 8:40 a.m. ET. ""Major Progress?""

Politico now reports that:

""Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Vice President Joe Biden engaged in furious overnight negotiations to avert the fiscal cliff and made major progress toward a year-end tax deal, giving sudden hope to high-stakes talks that had been on the brink of collapse, according to sources familiar with the discussion.""

There have been several such moments when hopes were high, of course.

As the White House and Congress debate how to steer clear of the fiscal cliff , one obstacle is the president 's insistence that the wealthy should pay more in taxes . And one way that could happen is through changing the rules for dividends and capital gains .
If you own a share of stock in a company today , when the company pays out a dividend , the most you 're taxed is 15 percent . And if you decide to sell the stock and cash out , you 'd also pay 15 percent on your profits — the capital gains .

Now , President Obama wants to raise those rates , but only for the wealthy .
Under his plan , for those earning more than $ 250,000 a year , capital gains would be taxed at 20 percent , and dividends would go back to being taxed as they had historically , as ordinary income , more than doubling the current rate .
`` Of course it 's never a bad time to be rich . But it 's a worse time to be rich now because , you know , President Obama has clearly said he wants the wealthier Americans to shoulder a bigger burden of the tax liability , '' says Bill Smith , with accounting firm CBIZ MHM .
Raising rates on investment income , as the president has proposed , would bring in about $ 240 billion over a decade . If Congress and the president ca n't reach a deal and the Bush tax cuts expire for everyone , it would be even more .
Smith says that as a result , some companies are making sure to pay dividends before Jan. 1 , and many people are cashing out investments to realize the capital gains in 2012 .

But Williams says that 's not what you should picture when you think about who is benefiting from the low rates in the current tax code .
`` High-income people are much more likely to have investments in the first place and more likely to have income from those investments , '' he says . `` And their tax savings are greater than those for people in lower income categories , because the difference between the capital gains rate and dividends rate and their ordinary tax rate is larger .

Why Dividends, Capital Gains Are Big Part Of Fiscal Cliff Talks Listen

As the White House and Congress debate how to steer clear of the fiscal cliff, one obstacle is the president's insistence that the wealthy should pay more in taxes. And one way that could happen is through changing the rules for dividends and capital gains.

If you own a share of stock in a company today, when the company pays out a dividend, the most you're taxed is 15 percent. And if you decide to sell the stock and cash out, you'd also pay 15 percent on your profits — the capital gains.

The tax code has long favored investment income over the money you get in your paycheck. But today's rates are especially low, dating to tax cuts installed under President George W. Bush.

Back in 2003, Congress set the top tax rates for both capital gains and dividends at 15 percent, lower than they had been since the 1930s.

Now, President Obama wants to raise those rates, but only for the wealthy.

Under his plan, for those earning more than $250,000 a year, capital gains would be taxed at 20 percent, and dividends would go back to being taxed as they had historically, as ordinary income, more than doubling the current rate.

""Of course it's never a bad time to be rich. But it's a worse time to be rich now because, you know, President Obama has clearly said he wants the wealthier Americans to shoulder a bigger burden of the tax liability,"" says Bill Smith, with accounting firm CBIZ MHM.

Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center says he was wondering the same thing when the deal was announced. Lucas ""certainly will save if we have the president's plan go into place, or go over the fiscal cliff.""

Like $400 million.

""He'll save more in tax than we will make in our entire lifetimes,"" says Williams.

Fewer than 20 percent of taxpayers report income from dividends, and even fewer get money from long-term capital gains.

There are certainly plenty of people who have the two shares of McDonald's their grandfather bought them, or are supplementing their income with dividends from the power company where they worked.

“ We have done our part by putting revenue on the table , ” said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor .
Cantor and fellow House leaders have agreed to close tax loopholes to generate revenue to reduce the $ 1.1 trillion annual deficit . But they argue the president has yet to say publicly what cuts he will make to the federal budget -- specifically to costly entitlement programs such as Medicare , Medicaid and Social Security -- to reduce the deficit .
They also say the president ’ s plan to extend tax cuts only to middle-class Americans will not generate enough revenue to significantly reduce the deficit .
The leaders made their argument the same day Gene Sperling , director of the president ’ s National Economic Council , told House Democrats that failing to extend Bush-era tax cuts to the top 2 percent of income earners could trickle down to hit the middle class , sources tell Fox News .
On Wednesday afternoon , the president ramped up his public pitch amid a backdrop of hand-picked , middle-class voters at the White House .
`` Right now , as we speak , Congress can pass a law that would prevent a tax hike on the first $ 250,000 of everybody 's income , ” he said . `` And that means that 98 percent of Americans and 97 percent of small businesses would n't see their income taxes go up by a single dime . ''
He also urged Americans to use social media to try to persuade their congressional representatives to take the deal – telling them to use Facebook and their Twitter accounts . Obama even announced a new White House hashtag My2K -- a reference to the estimated $ 2,200 tax increase that a typical middle-class family of four would see if the Bush tax cuts expire .
The president met later in the day with top U.S. business leaders to discuss his strategy and is scheduled Friday to host a rally in the Philadelphia area to again tout his plan .
Among the chief executive officers who were scheduled to attend the event were Muhtar Kent of Coca-Cola , Home Depot 's Frank Blake and Brian Roberts of Comcast .
Texas Sen. John Cornyn on Wednesday joined the chorus of Republican leaders appealing to the president to instead get engaged in negotiations , saying he has no public plan for cuts while continuing to criticize Republicans for demanding a tax-cut extension for all Americans .
“ All that Republicans are asking is to maintain the current rates until we adopt real bipartisan tax reform , ” Cornyn said in an editorial Wednesday in the Dallas Morning News .
However , later in the day , it was announced that two of Obama 's chief negotiators will meet Thursday with congressional leaders to gauge prospects for a deal .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and White House legislative chief Rob Nabors will meet separately with House Majority Leader John Boehner , Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nev. , and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California .
The White House and Congress are trying to reach a deal before Jan. 1 – when all of the Bush-era tax cuts are set to expire and huge reductions to the federal budget kick in automatically . Those spending cuts are part of a default agreement by Congress after it failed reach a more measured deal to reduce the roughly $ 1.3 trillion annual deficits that have brought the national debt to more than $ 16 trillion .
The mix of tax increases and budget cuts will equal roughly $ 100 billion alone next year and about $ 1.2 trillion over the next 10 years should Congress and the White House fail to reach a deal . Some economists say that could plunge the economy into a recession .

The fiscal cliff deal extends four key tax credits that benefit parents . The Child Tax Credit , the Earned Income Tax Credit and the American Opportunity Tax Credit are safe for five more years , while the Child Dependent Care Tax Credit will be permanently extended .
These credits were initially expanded under the Bush and Obama administrations , and they would have been reduced significantly if Congress had n't taken action to extend them before the beginning of the year . As a result , many Americans would have been worse off by hundreds -- or even thousands -- of dollars a year .
`` These are meaningful numbers to your lower or middle income taxpayers , '' said Arthur Bloom , a CPA and Partner at Marks Paneth & Shron LLP . `` Now you can put your mind at ease , because we do have an extension , and now we at least know what the rules are going forward . ''
Charlie and Jessica Shivers , parents of two , were bracing for a tax hit of $ 1,000 if the Child Tax Credit was n't extended . Had Congress let the expanded credit expire , the maximum amount they could receive would have dropped from $ 1,000 to $ 500 for each of their children .
Another parent , Linda Sadlouskos , said she would have trouble affording her son 's education if she lost access to the full $ 2,500 American Opportunity Tax Credit she was expecting . That credit was slated to revert to the smaller Hope Credit , meaning the maximum credit would slip to $ 1,800 , it would no longer be refundable and it would only be available for two years instead of four .
The Earned Income Tax Credit , which is estimated to keep millions of Americans out of poverty each year and especially benefits working parents with children , will also be restored for five years rather than being scaled back .

Finally , the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit was extended permanently , meaning that working parents will continue to receive a credit of as much as 35 % of child care-related expenses up to $ 3,000 per child or $ 6,000 per family . If this had n't been extended , parents would only be able to report up to $ 2,400 per child or $ 4,800 per child -- and receive a maximum credit of 30 % of expenses .
One tax break that will disappear , however , is the payroll tax cut that was passed in 2010 . Roughly 160 million workers can expect to pay more payroll tax , which funds Social Security , in the new year . People earning the national average salary of $ 41,000 will get $ 32 less in their biweekly paychecks . Shivers , who makes $ 84,000 , will see his annual pay shrink by a total of $ 1,700 .","Families who have been worried about losing thousands of dollars worth of tax breaks this year can stop panicking.

""These are meaningful numbers to your lower or middle income taxpayers,"" said Arthur Bloom, a CPA and Partner at Marks Paneth & Shron LLP. ""Now you can put your mind at ease, because we do have an extension, and now we at least know what the rules are going forward.""

Charlie and Jessica Shivers, parents of two, were bracing for a tax hit of $1,000 if the Child Tax Credit wasn't extended. Had Congress let the expanded credit expire, the maximum amount they could receive would have dropped from $1,000 to $500 for each of their children.

Another parent, Linda Sadlouskos, said she would have trouble affording her son's education if she lost access to the full $2,500 American Opportunity Tax Credit she was expecting. That credit was slated to revert to the smaller Hope Credit, meaning the maximum credit would slip to $1,800, it would no longer be refundable and it would only be available for two years instead of four.

The Earned Income Tax Credit, which is estimated to keep millions of Americans out of poverty each year and especially benefits working parents with children, will also be restored for five years rather than being scaled back.

Finally, the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit was extended permanently, meaning that working parents will continue to receive a credit of as much as 35% of child care-related expenses up to $3,000 per child or $6,000 per family. If this hadn't been extended, parents would only be able to report up to $2,400 per child or $4,800 per child -- and receive a maximum credit of 30% of expenses.

One tax break that will disappear, however, is the payroll tax cut that was passed in 2010. Roughly 160 million workers can expect to pay more payroll tax, which funds Social Security, in the new year. People earning the national average salary of $41,000 will get $32 less in their biweekly paychecks. Shivers, who makes $84,000, will see his annual pay shrink by a total of $1,700.",www.money.cnn.com,left,LyMOK6NV9K0y4mba

Biden pitches the plan to Democrats late Monday

Obama says more work will be needed and chides Congress for dragging its feet

""Take the 84% of your winnings off the table,"" anti-tax crusader advises GOP

Senate leaders and the White House struck a last-minute deal to avert the feared fiscal cliff Monday night, with Vice President Joe Biden headed to the Capitol Hill to pitch the plan to fellow Democrats.

""Happy New Year,"" Biden, who became the Democratic point man in the talks, told reporters. ""Did you think we would be here New Year's Eve?""

A senior Democratic aide told CNN that if caucus meetings went well, a Senate vote could come ""within the hour."" But the House of Representatives went home long before midnight, meaning nothing will get through Congress before the combination of tax increases and spending cuts lawmakers have been scrambling to head off starts to kick in, at least on paper.

Republicans in Congress hardened their resistance to President Barack Obama’s proposed higher taxes for top earners and demanded a spending-cut plan, as lawmakers in both parties said it’s becoming less likely an agreement can be enacted before the Christmas holiday.

Obama’s budget plan is “mainly tax hikes,” House Speaker John Boehner told reporters today in Washington. “We’ve got some serious differences.” During a phone call yesterday, Boehner said, he and the president were “frank” about “how far apart we are.”

Separately, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the prospect of more than $600 billion in spending cuts and tax increases “clearly” is having an effect on the economy “even though we’ve not yet even reached the point of the fiscal cliff kicking in.”

“It’s already affecting business and hiring decisions by creating uncertainty” or “pessimism,” he said at a news conference in Washington. “Clearly this is a major risk factor.”

“I actually believe that Congress will come up with a solution and I certainly hope they will,” Bernanke said.

If Congress doesn’t act, the tax increases and spending cuts will start taking effect in January. Tax rates for income at all levels will rise, along with taxes on estates, capital gains and dividends.

Gloomy Outlook

The gloomy outlook shared by Republicans and Democrats about passing a deal by Dec. 25 comes amid a campaign by outside groups, in particular chief executives of major companies, urging Obama and Boehner to find a compromise.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said the U.S. economy would thrive next year if lawmakers come up with a deal.

“You might have a booming economy in a couple of months,” with economic growth accelerating to 4 percent rather than 2 percent, Dimon said today at a conference in New York hosted by the New York Times’s DealBook.

Republicans say Obama’s unwillingness to specify entitlement spending reductions is hampering a deal, while Democrats say talks are stalled over Boehner’s refusal to allow income tax cuts to expire for the top 2 percent of earners.

“The reports I have from people at the White House are that Boehner and his staff really are unhelpful this week,” Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat, said today. “There just has been very little progress made.”

‘Very Disappointed’

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said on the Senate floor today he was “very, very disappointed” with the lack of progress. He said Republicans will either agree to raise tax rates for top earners, “or we are going to go over the cliff” of tax increases and spending cuts.

House leaders are telling members that votes are possible after Christmas, said Representative Doc Hastings, a Washington Republican. “It’s going to be a long December,” he said.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said Obama’s focus on higher tax rates for top earners has made a deal tough to reach.

“The president and his allies have taken so many things off the table the only thing left is varnish,” McConnell said.

“There’s not much progress,” said Representative Charles Boustany, a Louisiana Republican, after leaving a party meeting. “We’re going to hold the line” on tax rates.

No Timeline

White House press secretary Jay Carney said today the president will hold firm on his insistence that the rates for top earners go up. He wouldn’t give a timeline for the talks or for reaching a deal.

“The parameters of what a deal would look like are clear,” Carney said. While Obama is “willing to make tough choices on the spending side,” Republicans must accept letting rates rise for top earners, he said. Republican offers to raise revenue by curbing tax breaks are vague, he said.

Separately, Democrats are stepping up their campaign to extend tax cuts for all except the top earners. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California called on House Republicans to advance a Senate-passed bill to maintain tax cuts for married couples earning less than $250,000 a year.

Sixty-five percent of Americans say Obama’s Nov. 6 election victory gave him a mandate on his proposal to raise tax rates for top earners, according to a Bloomberg National Poll of 1,000 adults conducted Dec. 7-10. Majorities of about 2-to-1 also see the election results as an endorsement of Obama’s pledge to protect Social Security and Medicare benefits.

‘Isolated Themselves’

“The Republicans have isolated themselves,” Pelosi told reporters at the Capitol today. She compared the situation to the debate over the payroll tax cut extension in 2011, when days before its scheduled expiration, Republicans dropped their opposition. “Republicans are just delaying, delaying and delaying, and that’s not responsible.”

The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent to 1,428.61 at 4 p.m. in New York, erasing an earlier rally of as much as 0.8 percent. Treasuries fell. The benchmark 10-year yield increased five basis points to 1.7 percent, the highest since Nov. 23.

Obama held a meeting and conference call with a bipartisan group of mayors and community leaders to seek support for his talks with congressional Republicans on the budget.

“I didn’t detect frustration,” Mayor Michael Coleman of Columbus, Ohio, said of the president. “But I can tell you we’re frustrated, and I think America’s becoming frustrated.”

$1.4 Trillion

Obama yesterday reduced his demand for new tax revenue to $1.4 trillion from $1.6 trillion. Republicans still have an $800 billion revenue target, party aides said.

Boehner said Obama’s demand for $1.4 trillion in more tax revenue “can’t pass the House and Senate.” Durbin said the offer demonstrates that “the president’s trying to show some flexibility and move the negotiations forward.”

Representative Chris Van Hollen, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said he’s concerned Boehner may think he’s unable to make a deal perceived as “reasonable to the vast majority of the country” because it may put his speakership at risk when the next Congress convenes in January.

It’s becoming increasingly doubtful a plan can be enacted by Christmas, Van Hollen of Maryland said at a breakfast in Washington sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor. The two sides would have to strike a deal on a framework by the end of this week to pass legislation in both chambers by Dec. 25, he said.

Until Christmas Eve

“We are going to stay here right up until Christmas Eve, throughout the time period before the New Year,” said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a Virginia Republican.

The president’s plan also would include a corporate tax overhaul, according to an official familiar with the negotiations who wasn’t authorized to describe them publicly and asked to not be identified.

The two sides remain hundreds of billions of dollars apart on taxes and spending, and they continue to disagree on whether a year-end deal should include an increase in the debt limit and fresh programs to boost the economy.",www.bloomberg.com,center,Ao1iUtw6dxiI24du
fiscal_cliff,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jan/2/fiscal-cliff-deal-ignores-the-real-problem/,Fiscal Cliff deal ignores the real problem: Government ,2013-01-02,Colin Hanna,"Not until after the clock ran out on 2012 did the Senate cobble together a “ fiscal cliff ” deal that finally passed the House late on Jan. 1 , in a 257-167 vote . This deal amounts to a kind of “ bungee cord ” that has snapped us back to the top edge of the cliff again . That we should get a deal instead of a solution should come as no surprise . The entire process has been focused on the wrong problem all along .
The president , the House speaker , the Senate majority and minority leaders and , for that matter , Mitt Romney all have done the nation a major disservice by focusing almost exclusively on taxes for the top 1 percent or 2 percent of income earners for the past six months or so . Speaker John A. Boehner tried to talk about cutting spending , but the other side and its obsequious media are deaf to the subject . Democrats and Republicans alike have argued tenaciously that raising taxes on the rich , or not , is the heart of the problem . It ’ s not . The problem is overspending , not insufficient revenue from taxes .
Overspending is not hard to define , nor is it hard for the average citizen to grasp . Overspending simply means spending more than one takes in . It was deceitful for the president to imply that his tax-the-rich plan would fix the problem . It won ’ t . It ’ s deceitful now to suggest that any last-minute deal can somehow avert the principal disaster . It can ’ t , and it won ’ t . It ’ s time to stop looking for a deal and to start looking for a solution . “ Cut , Cap and Balance ” was a solution . If that had passed last summer , we wouldn ’ t be here . The House should have stood firm then and forced the Senate ’ s hand and then the president ’ s . Of course , the House-passed bill would have been weakened to get it through the Senate and signed by the president , but at least we ’ d be dealing with the right problem . We ’ d be on a path to lower deficits and fiscal sanity . We might have avoided a credit-rating cut . Moreover , we ’ d be talking about which sort of federal balanced-budget amendment would stand a chance to be ratified by 38 states .
Have many of us forgotten that the fiscal cliff came about as a result of the failure to come to an agreement on deficit reduction ? Have we likewise forgotten the official name of what came to be known as the supercommittee ? It was known formally as the Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction . The Budget Control Act of 2011 wasn ’ t primarily about tax rates — it was about reducing the deficit . So let ’ s begin our clear-eyed new-year analysis of where we stand with a re-examination of the deficit that the act was supposed to address .
The deficit for fiscal 2013 is estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to exceed $ 1 trillion once again — for the fifth consecutive year . Mr. Obama persuaded Congress to raise taxes to pre-2001 levels for every individual tax filer making more than $ 400,000 and joint filers making more than $ 450,000 . How much extra revenue will that produce ? About $ 60 billion . That ’ s just 6 percent of the $ 1 trillion annual deficit . Making a 6 percent dent in a problem that threatens the future worldwide economic leadership of the United States is not much of a solution .
How much would income tax rates need to rise to close the gap ? The number is so large that , in a sense , we ’ d never get there .

Not until after the clock ran out on 2012 did the Senate cobble together a “fiscal cliff” deal that finally passed the House late on Jan. 1, in a 257-167 vote. This deal amounts to a kind of “bungee cord” that has snapped us back to the top edge of the cliff again. That we should get a deal instead of a solution should come as no surprise. The entire process has been focused on the wrong problem all along.

The president, the House speaker, the Senate majority and minority leaders and, for that matter, Mitt Romney all have done the nation a major disservice by focusing almost exclusively on taxes for the top 1 percent or 2 percent of income earners for the past six months or so. Speaker John A. Boehner tried to talk about cutting spending, but the other side and its obsequious media are deaf to the subject. Democrats and Republicans alike have argued tenaciously that raising taxes on the rich, or not, is the heart of the problem. It’s not. The problem is overspending, not insufficient revenue from taxes.

Overspending is not hard to define, nor is it hard for the average citizen to grasp. Overspending simply means spending more than one takes in. It was deceitful for the president to imply that his tax-the-rich plan would fix the problem. It won’t. It’s deceitful now to suggest that any last-minute deal can somehow avert the principal disaster. It can’t, and it won’t. It’s time to stop looking for a deal and to start looking for a solution. “Cut, Cap and Balance” was a solution. If that had passed last summer, we wouldn’t be here. The House should have stood firm then and forced the Senate’s hand and then the president’s. Of course, the House-passed bill would have been weakened to get it through the Senate and signed by the president, but at least we’d be dealing with the right problem. We’d be on a path to lower deficits and fiscal sanity. We might have avoided a credit-rating cut. Moreover, we’d be talking about which sort of federal balanced-budget amendment would stand a chance to be ratified by 38 states.

Have many of us forgotten that the fiscal cliff came about as a result of the failure to come to an agreement on deficit reduction? Have we likewise forgotten the official name of what came to be known as the supercommittee? It was known formally as the Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. The Budget Control Act of 2011 wasn’t primarily about tax rates — it was about reducing the deficit. So let’s begin our clear-eyed new-year analysis of where we stand with a re-examination of the deficit that the act was supposed to address.

The deficit for fiscal 2013 is estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to exceed $1 trillion once again — for the fifth consecutive year. Mr. Obama persuaded Congress to raise taxes to pre-2001 levels for every individual tax filer making more than $400,000 and joint filers making more than $450,000. How much extra revenue will that produce? About $60 billion. That’s just 6 percent of the $1 trillion annual deficit. Making a 6 percent dent in a problem that threatens the future worldwide economic leadership of the United States is not much of a solution.

How much would income tax rates need to rise to close the gap? The number is so large that, in a sense, we’d never get there. It would require a tax increase on every taxpayer of more than 65 percent. We’d never get there because such a tax increase would tank the economy and cause incomes and the taxes on them to fall far short of the levels necessary to produce the projected revenue increase. Note that this is an increase greater than 65 percent on all taxpayers — low-, middle- and upper-income earners, plus corporations and others.

Here’s the rough calculation that leads to that 65 percent tax increase figure: The federal government borrows more than 40 cents out of every dollar. To get to a balanced budget without cutting expenditures and by raising taxes alone would thus require about a 67 percent increase to get from a 60 percent revenue level to a 100 percent revenue level.

We truly cannot get there — or even halfway there — by raising taxes. Rapid economic growth, coupled with real, substantive expenditure cuts, is the only practical route to reducing the deficit.

If you focus on the wrong problem, you’re almost always going to wind up with the wrong solution. Revenues are not the problem, and focusing on revenues in the face of a trillion-dollar deficit will lead to the wrong solution. The only way we’re going to get out of the unsustainable fiscal mess we are in is to focus on reducing spending and stimulating growth. The economy will not grow when a massive tax increase is imposed. Growth requires low taxes. Low taxes require smaller government. We’ve forgotten the most basic principles in economics, and until we re-embrace them, we should look at short-term fixes as worse than no fix, because they give an illusion of progress that is the polar opposite of their real effect. The looming debt-ceiling debate that’s next on the calendar may be exactly what we need to turn our focus to the real problem of overspending. Bring it on.

You can put your parachutes away . Washington is n't likely to take the country over the dreaded `` fiscal cliff .

That is not to say the journey wo n't be contentious and perhaps a cliffhanger . Do n't forget , the same cast of characters is starring in this big-screen epic – either a dark comedy or a thriller , take your pick – that has brought Americans to this point before : Democrats ruling the White House and Senate , and Republicans , including a clique of unyielding conservatives , in power in the House .
Yet analysts on both sides of the aisle believe that doing nothing , which on Jan. 1 would trigger the beginning of $ 600 billion in tax increases and large cuts to the federal budget , would inflict too much damage on individuals ' wallets , on the economy , and on America 's standing in the world .
The fiscal cliff , after all , was never intended to be a serious option . The elements of it grew out of years of debt avoidance and budget gimmickry that finally peaked in 2011 with the impasse over raising the federal debt ceiling . After a bipartisan congressional panel failed to agree on spending cuts , Republicans and Democrats added the infamous `` sequestration '' portion – a series of automatic spending cuts that were so distasteful that lawmakers would be forced to agree on more sensible trims .
While an agreement to avoid the cliff could still prove elusive , many veteran Washington-watchers believe a compromise will be worked out to avoid plunging into the abyss on New Year 's Eve .
`` America 's reputation and its economic stability are threatened dramatically by inaction , '' says Dan Glickman , a senior fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center who previously served as President Clinton 's secretary of Agriculture . `` Except for a few zealots , most people are n't going to want to see that happen . ''
Some even believe that the looming fiscal cliff will eventually lead to a grand bargain between the White House and Capitol Hill on reforming America 's tax code and entitlement programs – setting the tone , perhaps , for other agreements over the next few years on issues from immigration to energy . But let 's not get ahead of ourselves . Here are five reasons America wo n't – or let 's say should n't – plunge off the fiscal cliff on Jan. 1 .
Many believe the specter of a double-dip recession remains the most important reason that Congress and the president will reach some sort of accommodation by Jan. 1 . It 's something that neither party wants to see – or be blamed for .
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that with the massive spending cuts and tax increases imposed by the cliff , US gross domestic product would shrink by a half percentage point in 2013 . ( Some private sector forecasters believe the hit could be even more severe . ) That amounts to 2.7 million fewer jobs than the economy would otherwise create by year 's end , the CBO says , which would push the unemployment rate , now at 7.9 percent , above 9 percent .
Even without the drag of the cliff , the CBO calculates that the economy will grow an anemic 1.7 percent this year and unemployment will hover around 8 percent . With Europe mired in its own fiscal problems , and the world 's other big economy , China , slowing as well , a downturn in the United States could have disastrous global consequences .
`` I have to believe that common sense and self-preservation will prevail '' in the face of such economic peril , says Maya MacGuineas , president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and a leading advocate for a grand budget deal styled after the president 's debt commission . `` It 's not going to be easier to fix the problem by putting the country into a recession – quite the opposite . ''
The tax increases imposed by the cliff on Americans , collectively , would be the highest in six decades as measured by a percentage of the economy . No one who pays income tax would be spared , and many others would n't either .
Much of the attention has focused on the expiration of Bush-era tax cuts that would benefit the wealthy . President Obama has indicated he opposes any agreement that would extend tax cuts on those with household incomes above $ 250,000 , while House Speaker John Boehner ( R ) of Ohio believes allowing higher rates on upper-income Americans would slow job growth . Mr. Boehner has implied that the wealthy could pay more by reducing the tax deductions they receive – but not by increasing their marginal tax rates .
Yet many of the tax increases that would occur if the fiscal cliff takes effect would fall on middle-income Americans . A household earning $ 50,000 per year , for instance , would see its taxes grow by $ 2,000 in 2013 , according to the Tax Policy Center . That 's in addition to the planned expiration of tax credits for low-income earners and college students passed in 2009 as part of the economic stimulus package .
One of the biggest impacts would come from failing to fix the AMT , or alternative minimum tax . When it was first passed , the AMT was designed to prevent rich people from exploiting loopholes to avoid paying income taxes . But because the AMT was n't indexed for inflation , it has hit more middle-income families over time . While Congress has acted each year to limit how many people are affected by it , an unresolved cliff package would lead to a nearly sevenfold increase in the number of Americans ( from 4 million to about 30 million ) who would be affected by the law when they file their 2012 income taxes in the new year .
`` You will have 30 million angry constituents and they will ask you why , '' says John Buckley , a professor of tax law at Georgetown University Law School in Washington , who adds : `` I do n't think Congress can tolerate that . ''
While lawmakers can posture all they want over the fiscal cliff , there is one American institution that registers its opinion every day irrespective of the machinations of Washington – Wall Street .
Many analysts expect the stock market to play a role in pressuring the two sides to hatch some sort of agreement . Letting the nation fall off the cliff – or even approach the cliff – could result in a catastrophic drop in the stock market , they say , which would erode people 's portfolios and financial institutions ' balance sheets .
`` If this craters , that means markets crater , '' says Douglas Holtz-Eakin , a former director of the CBO and president of the conservative American Action Forum . `` And that means all that collateral for the banks crater . '' He thinks the nation would be facing some of the same problems it did in 2008 , at the beginning of the financial crisis .
The markets have already been registering their views over this fiscal pivot point , as they did over earlier ones . In the first week after the election , the Standard & Poor 's 500 index sank 2.3 percent , in part over anxiety about the higher tax rates on capital gains and dividends if the fiscal cliff is n't fixed .
In 2008 , after the House rejected the bank bailout plan ( the Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP ) , the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 700 points . When the legislation returned to the floor days later , the bill drew nearly 60 new supporters and the legislation passed .
`` These catastrophic market moves had a major inspirational effect in getting Congress to act , '' says Mr. Glickman , who is also a former member of the House from Kansas . `` The markets are a big factor in this . [ Their impact ] may be psychological , but if the markets lose confidence I think Congress becomes more reactive to that . ''
The cliff , unresolved , would enforce about $ 100 billion in infamous `` sequestration cuts . '' About half of that would come from military spending and the rest from across-the-board trims in `` discretionary '' programs , with the exception of a few things like Social Security , veterans ' benefits , and children 's health insurance . Groups all across the political spectrum are lining up to prevent the indiscriminate pruning . Republicans do n't like the huge cuts to military spending , which would amount to about 10 percent , nor do some Democrats , including Defense Secretary Leon Panetta , who has said it would lead to substantial job losses and reductions in major weapons programs .
Federal emergency assistance would be cut about 8 percent , something that would be difficult even without the sodden destruction of superstorm Sandy . The Secret Service , highway funding , health research , air-traffic controllers , the FBI , environmental protection – outlays for all these would be slashed and all have their constituencies .
`` Across-the-board cuts are not policy – they are arithmetic , '' says Tim Westmoreland , a visiting professor at Georgetown Law School and former counsel to the House Subcommittee on Health and the Environment . `` They are less than mindless . ''
This was the intention , of course , to goad lawmakers into making `` responsible '' spending cuts , under the threat of irresponsible ones . Will it work ? At least many in Washington are complaining about the reckless nature of the trims , though that is a long way from being able to agree on which programs to pare back .
One popular view in Washington has been that the election changed nothing . The same parties hang onto the same institutions . Commentators bicker over just what constitutes a mandate – was Mr. Obama 's win big enough ? What about voters returning a Republican majority in the House ?
Yet many lawmakers on Capitol Hill have read the election as an order from the American people : Work together . The question is whether it will translate into a deal on the fiscal cliff . Certainly both parties have at least some incentive to get something done .
Obama is free of the burden of having to face the voters again and will be increasingly mindful of his legacy . Neither he nor congressional Democrats will want to waste the first 18 months of his final term in office , typically the most productive time for a lame-duck president .
The Republicans , too , may be in a more compromising mood . While House Republicans in particular had plenty of incentive to challenge the president leading into the election – to make him a weaker candidate – those calculations have changed with the GOP 's losses in 2012 and with the party 's concerns about 2014 . Republicans have also now lost the White House in four out of the last six elections and the popular vote in five of those contests .
`` Boehner wants a compromise as well , '' says David Walker , head of the Comeback America Initiative , a group that promotes fiscal responsibility . `` The Republicans ca n't be seen as obstructionist on all these issues because that will hurt them in the 2014 election . ''
Boehner , Obama , and Senate majority leader Harry Reid ( D ) of Nevada have all sounded conciliatory notes since Election Day , a stark departure from the heated rhetoric of the campaign season . They are being nudged toward some sort of rapprochement by a widening array of outside groups . The business community , for instance , is vowing to play a more vocal role in getting both parties to reach an agreement on the fiscal cliff and to pursue a grand bargain on debt and deficits . Many lawmakers criticized the captains of industry for remaining silent during last summer 's fiscal crisis .
`` We saw what we did with the debt ceiling , and we 're scared to death that the same thing will happen on the fiscal cliff , '' says Dave Cote , the chief executive officer of Honeywell , who is heading up a coalition of CEOs lobbying Washington for a deal . The group , known as the Fix the Debt campaign , met recently with Obama at the White House .
Still , for all the pressure and practical reasons for fashioning a deal , not everyone is opposed to tumbling into the abyss . Some lawmakers in Washington see political advantage in letting elements of the package go into effect or at least bumping up against the deadline to spur changes .
Many conservative House Republicans vow to fight for the spending cuts they were promised in the summer of 2011 in order to raise the debt ceiling , believing they are necessary to restore the nation 's fiscal health .
`` What 's important is that we not raise taxes , but I think if there 's a move to suspend the sequester , I think that 's a problem , '' says Rep. Jim Jordan ( R ) of Ohio , the outgoing chairman of the Republican Study Committee , the House 's largest and most conservative caucus . `` The only thing worse than cutting national defense is not cutting anything at all . ''
Democrats , led publicly by Sen. Patty Murray of Washington , have said they would be willing to go into 2013 with no deal , allowing all the Bush-era tax cuts to expire if Republicans do n't concede to one of Obama 's enduring demands : that tax rates rise on household income over $ 250,000 . They also argue that by holding out for the new year , and letting the tax rates revert back to their pre-Bush-era levels , it offers Republicans cover for a pledge signed by more than 90 percent of them to never raise taxes . The rates would go up – with no Republican vote – and all votes thereafter would be for tax cuts that both sides want , notably for middle-class Americans and small businesses . There are procedural moves the White House could make , too , to blunt the effect of going into January without a deal . It could direct government agencies to hold off on planned spending cuts until later in the year , or have the Treasury Department manipulate withholding rates to mitigate tax changes . Still , all this would only give the administration a little extra time , and if Republicans did n't capitulate , the risk for Democrats is that stock markets could explode , turning a point of leverage into a liability .
`` It seems to me that the pressure is perfectly balanced '' between Democrats and Republicans , says J.D . Foster , a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation .
With the political pressure mounting on all sides , several scenarios exist for how Washington might avoid the fiscal cliff . Many Democrats , led by majority leader Mr. Reid , want to use the fiscal cliff to reach a broader accord on entitlement and tax reform as well as reducing the nation 's deficit .
Boehner , however , has offered a more modest hope : a `` down payment '' of deficit reduction to prove Washington 's seriousness to wary credit-rating agencies , which would be attached to guidelines for achieving tax and entitlement reform in 2013 .
Veteran Washington-watchers think the speaker 's path is more likely because of its limited aspirations for what is already a chaotic session of Congress between now and Christmas . Such a deal would include perhaps $ 50 billion in deficit reduction , targets for revenue and spending as percentages of GDP , and goals for entitlement reform for congressional committees to work toward in the coming year .
This is the most viable scenario because it gives Congress `` an opportunity to fight another day , '' says Bruce Josten , the US Chamber of Commerce 's executive vice president for government affairs . `` The real battle between the two parties is tax and entitlement reform . ''
And it 's this fight that will truly test the current mood in Washington . It will not be about avoiding economic catastrophe , but about the most sacred issues for each party : taxes for Republicans and entitlements for Democrats .
`` Everyone 's in favor of tax reform before they get into specifics , '' says Rep. Chris Van Hollen ( D ) of Maryland , the ranking member of the House Budget Committee . `` I think there are ways that we can reform the tax code , and we should reform the tax code , but it is not a panacea '' for America 's economic problems .
While a grand bargain may be difficult to achieve , what worries many analysts is that Washington will do virtually nothing – just enough to resolve the fiscal cliff but not address the nation 's debt and deficit problems in a meaningful way .
`` Our concern about the cliff is not that we 're going to go off it , '' says Jim Kessler , a co-founder of the center-left group the Third Way . `` But that our fear of going off it will convince leaders to do something very modest on the deficit instead of something bold and that we 'll miss this opportunity .

If Congress and the White House do come to some substantial accord , however , it could spur progress on other issues , from immigration to education to energy .
`` The tone will be set completely over the next 10 weeks , '' says Mr. Kessler . `` If there 's a major deal here , the stoppage in the drain has been cleared and a whole series of things can happen . ''","Relax, America. You can put your parachutes away. Washington isn't likely to take the country over the dreaded ""fiscal cliff."" Even a capital city as deadlocked and dysfunctional as Washington has been in recent years is not likely to risk a move that has so many economic and political ramifications, according to a wide range of experts.

That is not to say the journey won't be contentious and perhaps a cliffhanger. Don't forget, the same cast of characters is starring in this big-screen epic – either a dark comedy or a thriller, take your pick – that has brought Americans to this point before: Democrats ruling the White House and Senate, and Republicans, including a clique of unyielding conservatives, in power in the House.

But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Here are five reasons America won't – or let's say shouldn't – plunge off the fiscal cliff on Jan. 1.

Because of the ""R"" word.

Many believe the specter of a double-dip recession remains the most important reason that Congress and the president will reach some sort of accommodation by Jan. 1. It's something that neither party wants to see – or be blamed for.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that with the massive spending cuts and tax increases imposed by the cliff, US gross domestic product would shrink by a half percentage point in 2013. (Some private sector forecasters believe the hit could be even more severe.) That amounts to 2.7 million fewer jobs than the economy would otherwise create by year's end, the CBO says, which would push the unemployment rate, now at 7.9 percent, above 9 percent.

Even without the drag of the cliff, the CBO calculates that the economy will grow an anemic 1.7 percent this year and unemployment will hover around 8 percent. With Europe mired in its own fiscal problems, and the world's other big economy, China, slowing as well, a downturn in the United States could have disastrous global consequences.

""I have to believe that common sense and self-preservation will prevail"" in the face of such economic peril, says Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and a leading advocate for a grand budget deal styled after the president's debt commission. ""It's not going to be easier to fix the problem by putting the country into a recession – quite the opposite.""

Because of the impact on pocketbooks.

The tax increases imposed by the cliff on Americans, collectively, would be the highest in six decades as measured by a percentage of the economy. No one who pays income tax would be spared, and many others wouldn't either.

Much of the attention has focused on the expiration of Bush-era tax cuts that would benefit the wealthy.

But because the AMT wasn't indexed for inflation, it has hit more middle-income families over time. While Congress has acted each year to limit how many people are affected by it, an unresolved cliff package would lead to a nearly sevenfold increase in the number of Americans (from 4 million to about 30 million) who would be affected by the law when they file their 2012 income taxes in the new year.

""You will have 30 million angry constituents and they will ask you why,"" says John Buckley, a professor of tax law at Georgetown University Law School in Washington, who adds: ""I don't think Congress can tolerate that.""

Because of the 401(k) effect.

While lawmakers can posture all they want over the fiscal cliff, there is one American institution that registers its opinion every day irrespective of the machinations of Washington – Wall Street.

Many analysts expect the stock market to play a role in pressuring the two sides to hatch some sort of agreement. Letting the nation fall off the cliff – or even approach the cliff – could result in a catastrophic drop in the stock market, they say, which would erode people's portfolios and financial institutions' balance sheets.

""The markets are a big factor in this. [Their impact] may be psychological, but if the markets lose confidence I think Congress becomes more reactive to that.""

Because of the sharpness of the paring knife.

The cliff, unresolved, would enforce about $100 billion in infamous ""sequestration cuts."" About half of that would come from military spending and the rest from across-the-board trims in ""discretionary"" programs, with the exception of a few things like Social Security, veterans' benefits, and children's health insurance. Groups all across the political spectrum are lining up to prevent the indiscriminate pruning.

At least many in Washington are complaining about the reckless nature of the trims, though that is a long way from being able to agree on which programs to pare back.

Because of the changing political calculus.

One popular view in Washington has been that the election changed nothing. The same parties hang onto the same institutions. Commentators bicker over just what constitutes a mandate – was Mr. Obama's win big enough? What about voters returning a Republican majority in the House?

Yet many lawmakers on Capitol Hill have read the election as an order from the American people: Work together. The question is whether it will translate into a deal on the fiscal cliff. Certainly both parties have at least some incentive to get something done.

In the 2009 stimulus , he insisted on making tax credits “ fully refundable , ” so that even people who did not make enough to pay much federal tax would benefit . The 2010 health care law overhaul was probably the biggest attack on inequality since it began rising in the 1970s , increasing taxes on businesses and the rich to pay for health insurance largely for the middle class .
As part of this week ’ s deal , Mr. Obama did make several major compromises . He accepted much less in overall tax revenue than the government would have received absent any deal . He allowed a payroll-tax cut , which applied to most households , to expire .

On average , the top 0.1 percent of earners — whose incomes start at $ 2.7 million and go much higher — will pay $ 444,000 more in taxes in 2013 than they otherwise would have , according to the Tax Policy Center . The increases stem from both the fiscal deal and the new taxes in the health care law .
In effect , the deal preserves the “ compassionate conservative ” part of President George W. Bush ’ s tax agenda — reducing federal income taxes on the working poor , sometimes to zero — while limiting the parts that most helped the affluent .
Even one of the chief architects of the Bush tax cuts , R. Glenn Hubbard , now dean of Columbia Business School , did not celebrate the enshrinement of most of them . He said in an interview that the deal would amplify the tax code ’ s distortions on the economy .

On average, the top 0.1 percent of earners — whose incomes start at $2.7 million and go much higher — will pay $444,000 more in taxes in 2013 than they otherwise would have, according to the Tax Policy Center. The increases stem from both the fiscal deal and the new taxes in the health care law.

In effect, the deal preserves the “compassionate conservative” part of President George W. Bush’s tax agenda — reducing federal income taxes on the working poor, sometimes to zero — while limiting the parts that most helped the affluent.

Even one of the chief architects of the Bush tax cuts, R. Glenn Hubbard, now dean of Columbia Business School, did not celebrate the enshrinement of most of them. He said in an interview that the deal would amplify the tax code’s distortions on the economy.

Former President Bill Clinton, by contrast, has told people that he considers the deal a good one, according to two people who have spoken to him.",www.nytimes.com,left,ywkwjggu0RCUN4dU

President Barack Obama spoke separately Friday with Speaker John Boehner and the top Senate Democrat to try to salvage a fiscal cliff deal by the end of year , after Republican disarray in the U.S. House put the negotiations in limbo .
In a previously unscheduled statement to reporters , Obama outlined a possible agreement that he said would include protecting middle-class Americans from a tax hike , extending unemployment benefits and setting a framework for future deficit reduction steps .
He called on Congress to pass the agreement after a Christmas break so he can sign it before the end of the year , when the fiscal cliff arrives in the form of automatic tax increases and deep spending cuts .
`` Laws can only pass with support from Democrats and Republicans , '' Obama said in urging both sides to compromise .

Boehner 's spokesman said the speaker will be `` ready to find a solution that can pass both houses of Congress '' when he returns to Washington .
While congressional leaders continued to bicker Friday over the next step , the president 's phone discussion with Boehner and a White House meeting with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid signaled an attempt to provide the nation and investors with hope that an agreement can be reached .
An aide to Reid said the short-term proposal to avoid the fiscal cliff should include extending tax cuts for middle-class families and unemployment insurance while delaying the automatic spending cuts set to take effect in the new year .
Obama acknowledged what had become obvious : the broader deficit reduction deal he seeks will likely come in stages , rather than in the so-called grand bargain he and Boehner have been negotiating .
The main issue of disagreement continued to be taxes , specifically whether rates should go up on top income brackets for the wealthiest Americans as part of an agreement to reduce the nation 's chronic federal deficits and debt .
Without a deal , the fiscal cliff could trigger a recession , economists warn . Stocks closed down sharply on Friday over the latest impasse in the deficit talks , a sign of investor fears of a slowdown as the nation slowly continued to emerge from recession .
Earlier Friday , Reid called for House Republicans to quickly approve a Senate plan championed by Obama that would extend tax cuts for family income up to $ 250,000 while allowing rates to return to higher levels of the 1990s above that threshold .
His Republican counterpart , Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , responded that the Senate should instead take up a House Republican measure extending the tax cuts for everyone as a temporary move before negotiations next year on broader tax reform .
The GOP revulsion over any kind of tax rate increase has stymied deficit negotiations for two years and led to unusual political drama , such as McConnell recently filibustering his own proposal and Thursday night 's rebuff by House Republicans of an alternative tax plan pushed by Boehner , their leader .
Boehner said at a news conference Friday that his Republican colleagues refused to back his plan , which would have extended all tax cuts except for income over $ 1 million , because of fears of being blamed for a tax increase .
`` They were n't taking it out on me , '' he said . `` They were dealing with the perception that somebody might accuse them of raising taxes . ''
The lack of backing by his own caucus was a political blow to Boehner and raised more questions than answers about what happens next in the tough negotiations with Obama on either a broad deficit reduction agreement or a smaller step to avoid the fiscal cliff .
A senior Democratic Senate source said scenarios under consideration by the party include trying to work out short-term or comprehensive agreements now , or going into next year -- and over the fiscal cliff -- without a deal to quickly pass a compromise plan in the new Congress that convenes on January 3 .
Waiting until next year would make the vote a tax cut from the automatic higher rates that will take effect under the fiscal cliff , instead of the current situation of extending some cuts and having top rates go up , the source noted .
In addition , Democrats will have two more seats in the new Senate and a stronger House minority , as well as increased pressure on Republicans to keep taxes low on middle class Americans , according to the source .
Trying to hammer out a deal now means working with limited time and stronger Republican contingents in both chambers , the source said .
Boehner made clear Friday that the negotiations with Obama on a broad deficit reduction agreement hit an impasse this week when both sides offered their `` bottom line '' positions that included major concessions -- but remained a few hundred billion dollars apart .
With his alternative plan torpedoed by his own party , Boehner said it now is time for Obama and Senate Democrats to come up with a solution .
Boehner also denied a reporter 's suggestion that he is walking away from further talks , but he offered no timetable or mechanism for resuming discussions .
In the Senate , Reid said all House measures on the fiscal cliff so far have failed to meet the minimum demands of Obama , such as wealthy Americans paying more to prevent an increased burden on middle-class families .
`` I like John Boehner , but gee whiz , this is a pretty big political battering that he has taken , '' Reid said , calling on the speaker to allow a vote on the Senate-passed Obama plan . `` It will pass . Democrats will vote for it . Some Republicans will vote for it . That is what we are supposed to do . ''
On Thursday night , the House passed a measure that would reduce the impact of the fiscal cliff 's automatic spending cuts on the military .
However , the chamber then went into recess when it was clear Boehner lacked the votes for his separate tax plan that maintained cut rates on income up to $ 1 million .
Conservatives opposed to any kind of increase in tax rates refused to sign on , and with Democrats unified in their opposition , the measure had no chance of passing .
`` There was a perception created that that vote last night was going to increase taxes . I disagree with that characterization , '' Boehner said Friday by way of explanation , adding that `` the perception was out there , and a lot of our members did not want to have to deal with it . ''
Reid had said the Senate would spurn the Boehner plan if it passed the House , and Obama promised to veto it if it reached his desk . According to Republican sources , the zero chance for Boehner 's Plan B to actually become law influenced some wavering House members to reject it .
Obama campaigned for re-election on extending the tax cuts that date back to his predecessor 's administration on income up to $ 250,000 for families , but returning to higher rates on amounts above that threshold .
Some House Republicans have said they would join Democrats in supporting the president 's proposal in hopes of moving past the volatile issue to focus on the spending cuts and entitlement reforms they seek .
The Plan B was significant because Republican leaders previously insisted they would n't raise rates on anyone .

Boehner also repeated his complaint that Obama and Democrats were unwilling to address the spending cuts and entitlement reforms that he considers necessary to properly address the nation 's chronic federal deficits and debt .
`` What the president has proposed so far simply wo n't do anything to solve our spending problems , '' Boehner said , noting that `` because of the political divide in the country , because of the divide here in Washington , trying to bridge these differences has been difficult . ''
In his statement Friday , Obama said he had compromised at least halfway on major issues , and that both sides have to accept they will not get all they want .

House Republican leaders Wednesday said the Senate needs to act first on legislation to avert the fiscal cliff , hinting they would not bring the House back into session until Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D-Nev. ) moves something through his chamber .
The statement — from House Speaker John Boehner , Majority Leader Eric Cantor , Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy and Conference Chairman Cathy McMorris Rodgers — said if the Senate “ will not approve and send them to the president to be signed into law in their current form , they must be amended and returned to the House . ”
“ Once this has occurred , the House will then consider whether to accept the bills as amended , or to send them back to the Senate with additional amendments , ” the statement read . “ The House will take this action on whatever the Senate can pass , but the Senate first must act . The lines of communication remain open , and we will continue to work with our colleagues to avert the largest tax hike in American history , and to address the underlying problem , which is spending . ”
Late Wednesday , Senate Democrats fired back , saying House Republicans should pass a bill that would extend tax rates for income below $ 250,000 . “ The Senate bill could pass tomorrow if House Republicans would simply let it come to the floor , ” said Adam Jentleson , a spokesman for Reid .
It comes after House Republican leadership held a conference call Wednesday , as a stalemate over the fiscal cliff continues . On Thursday , all House Republican lawmakers will have a conference call with leadership .
The call was limited to top GOP leaders , not the full House Republican conference , according to several sources . Leaders communicate frequently by conference call when the House is out of session . No decisions were made on the call .
Right now , the GOP position on the fiscal cliff is that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid needs to move a bill to avert the fiscal cliff or else he ’ s abdicating his duties . That line will be played on repeat this week , aides say .
In a few days , tax rates jump on all income levels and federal spending cuts take hold . And late Wednesday , Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told Congressional leadership the nation ’ s statutory borrowing cap would be hit on Dec. 31 . “ Extraordinary measures ” would allow the federal government to continue borrowing money for two months . But the fiscal cliff standoff throws even that calculation into flux .
But top Republicans also need to discuss whether to bring the House into session . GOP leadership has promised lawmakers a 48-hour warning if they decide to convene . That means the absolute earliest the House can come back would be Friday , if the warning was given Wednesday . But weather in Washington is dreadful and it 's the height of the holiday travel season .

Late Wednesday, Senate Democrats fired back, saying House Republicans should pass a bill that would extend tax rates for income below $250,000. “The Senate bill could pass tomorrow if House Republicans would simply let it come to the floor,” said Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Reid.

It comes after House Republican leadership held a conference call Wednesday, as a stalemate over the fiscal cliff continues. On Thursday, all House Republican lawmakers will have a conference call with leadership.

The call was limited to top GOP leaders, not the full House Republican conference, according to several sources. Leaders communicate frequently by conference call when the House is out of session. No decisions were made on the call.

Right now, the GOP position on the fiscal cliff is that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid needs to move a bill to avert the fiscal cliff or else he’s abdicating his duties. That line will be played on repeat this week, aides say.

In a few days, tax rates jump on all income levels and federal spending cuts take hold. And late Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told Congressional leadership the nation’s statutory borrowing cap would be hit on Dec. 31. “Extraordinary measures” would allow the federal government to continue borrowing money for two months. But the fiscal cliff standoff throws even that calculation into flux.

But top Republicans also need to discuss whether to bring the House into session. GOP leadership has promised lawmakers a 48-hour warning if they decide to convene. That means the absolute earliest the House can come back would be Friday, if the warning was given Wednesday. But weather in Washington is dreadful and it's the height of the holiday travel season. Sources say it’s still possible the House returns before Jan. 1.",www.politico.com,left,FurFsat1mkn1VDxE

“So long as you come out with a balanced approach, you could come up with almost any number,” California Rep. Xavier Becerra, the incoming Democratic Caucus chairman, told POLITICO. “You can do any number of things.”

Much of the year-end tax debate has thus far focused on how far Republicans are willing to move toward tax hikes. And House Democrats — like almost everyone else on Capitol Hill — remain on the outside of talks between House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Obama.

But their importance could skyrocket if the speaker and the president are able to negotiate a year-end budget package. Democrats in the chamber — mostly relegated to afterthoughts after losing the majority in 2010 — will almost certainly be called on to move the package across the finish line to offset GOP defections.

Most Democrats aren’t likely to buck the White House, but the administration is already bending on how much money it wants to gin up through a fiscal cliff deal. After initially asking for $1.6 trillion in revenue, the administration gave Republicans a proposal this week that shaved the request down to $1.4 trillion.

Most Democrats say they want a deal that hews as closely to Obama’s opening bid as possible and reject the $800 billion in revenue offered by Republicans as inadequate.

If lawmakers were to pursue the precise middle ground between the Republican and Democratic offers, they’d find themselves in the neighborhood of $1.2 trillion. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) said that’s a revenue goal she could accept.

“Without me committing Democrats, what I would say is we are open to an idea that is in that range,” she told POLITICO.

''
“ There is a stalemate . Let ’ s not kid ourselves , ” the Ohio Republican said of the talks between both parties over how to avert a year-end package of tax increases and spending cuts that could throw the economy into recession .
Boehner spoke minutes after Obama appealed to the public Friday for support of his tax plan , which calls for an extension of existing Bush-era tax rates for households earning $ 250,000 or less , while allowing increases to kick in for income earned above that threshold .
Obama said it will be a `` Scrooge Christmas '' for millions of middle-class Americans who could see their tax rates rise if Congress fails to agree to his plan .
The president spoke after touring a Pennsylvania-based toy manufacturing facility that makes parts for Tinkertoys , K'NEX Building Sets and Lincoln Logs . He said he needs Americans to put pressure on Congress members to pass his proposal .
`` I want you to call , I want you to send an email , post on their Facebook wall , '' he said on the factory floor of The Rodon Group in Hatfield , Pa .
Boehner quickly shot back that it would be a “ crippling blow ” for small business owners if tax rates increase for the top 2 percent of earners .
“ Raising taxes on small businesses -- instead of taking a balanced approach that would cut spending -- is wrong , ” the Ohio Republican told reporters .
Obama accused a `` handful of Republicans '' on Friday of holding middle class tax cuts `` hostage , '' and he said both sides need to `` get out of our comfort zones '' to reach an agreement .
“ I ’ ve been keeping my own naughty-and-nice list from Washington . You should keep your eye on who gets some K ’ NEX this year . There ’ s going to be some members of Congress who get them and some who don ’ t , ” Obama said , adding that it will be a “ lump of coal ” for middle class families if they see their taxes go up .
Obama ’ s and Boehner ’ s remarks Friday underscored the fierce partisan divide in Washington over how to handle the year-end fiscal crunch .
If the two sides can ’ t come together , tax rates will go up for all income brackets . Polls have suggested that if that happens , a majority of Americans will lay the blame on the GOP , and President Obama has been engaging in a campaign-style effort to portray Republicans as willing to let everyone ’ s taxes go up in a bid to protect the rich .

“There is a stalemate. Let’s not kid ourselves,” the Ohio Republican said of the talks between both parties over how to avert a year-end package of tax increases and spending cuts that could throw the economy into recession.

Boehner spoke minutes after Obama appealed to the public Friday for support of his tax plan, which calls for an extension of existing Bush-era tax rates for households earning $250,000 or less, while allowing increases to kick in for income earned above that threshold.

Obama said it will be a ""Scrooge Christmas"" for millions of middle-class Americans who could see their tax rates rise if Congress fails to agree to his plan.

The president spoke after touring a Pennsylvania-based toy manufacturing facility that makes parts for Tinkertoys, K'NEX Building Sets and Lincoln Logs. He said he needs Americans to put pressure on Congress members to pass his proposal.

""I want you to call, I want you to send an email, post on their Facebook wall,"" he said on the factory floor of The Rodon Group in Hatfield, Pa.

Boehner quickly shot back that it would be a “crippling blow” for small business owners if tax rates increase for the top 2 percent of earners.

“Raising taxes on small businesses -- instead of taking a balanced approach that would cut spending -- is wrong,” the Ohio Republican told reporters.

Obama accused a ""handful of Republicans"" on Friday of holding middle class tax cuts ""hostage,"" and he said both sides need to ""get out of our comfort zones"" to reach an agreement.

“I’ve been keeping my own naughty-and-nice list from Washington. You should keep your eye on who gets some K’NEX this year. There’s going to be some members of Congress who get them and some who don’t,” Obama said, adding that it will be a “lump of coal” for middle class families if they see their taxes go up.

Obama’s and Boehner’s remarks Friday underscored the fierce partisan divide in Washington over how to handle the year-end fiscal crunch.

If the two sides can’t come together, tax rates will go up for all income brackets. Polls have suggested that if that happens, a majority of Americans will lay the blame on the GOP, and President Obama has been engaging in a campaign-style effort to portray Republicans as willing to let everyone’s taxes go up in a bid to protect the rich.

Senior Republican aides made it clear that differences remain .

Speaker Boehner offers higher tax rates on millionaires as a back-up plan
Boehner says Americans do n't need more stress after the school shooting
The president wants the higher rates to apply to income above $ 250,000
In the chess match of the fiscal cliff negotiations , President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner are narrowing the divide between their positions while contending with discontent among their respective ranks .
Boehner on Tuesday proposed what recently was the unthinkable for Republicans -- letting tax rates go up on income above $ 1 million as a short-term step to avoid some of the fiscal cliff while continuing to negotiate a broader deal .
The White House and Democratic leaders immediately rejected Boehner 's move , saying the focus should be on a comprehensive deficit-reduction agreement instead of a partial step that no one likes .
It was the latest in a series of concessions by both sides since last week 's school shooting in Connecticut that killed 20 youngsters .
Asked if the massacre affected what had been incremental negotiations , Boehner said : `` I think both sides would agree to that . ''
`` This is a difficult time for Americans , '' he said , adding that `` it 's not a time to put Americans through more stress . ''

At the White House , spokesman Jay Carney acknowledged that the Newtown tragedy had affected all Americans and `` reminds us what really matters , '' but he stopped short of saying it had directly impacted the talks .
`` It 's obviously hard to know what the impact of an event like that is on the way that lawmakers and others in Washington approach other issues , '' Carney told reporters . He later added , `` To the extent that an event like that , as tragic as it is , brings us a little closer together , both in the nation and in Washington , that would be a good thing , but it 's hard to measure an impact like that . ''
The latest back-and-forth in the negotiations came two weeks from the end of the year , when automatic tax increases and spending cuts of the fiscal cliff will take effect .
At a news conference after meeting with House members Tuesday , Boehner called his new proposal a `` plan B '' to prevent tax rates from rising on everyone next year as part of the fiscal cliff .
The Ohio Republican told reporters it was important to have a `` backup plan '' to hold down most tax rates while continuing to negotiate a broader agreement . A Republican source told CNN that Boehner 's plan B also would include GOP priorities to make permanent the current estate tax and alternative minimum tax .
While addressing part of the fiscal cliff , the Boehner plan B would leave intact government spending cuts , including defense , that are required under a budget deal reached last year to raise the federal debt ceiling . Known as sequestration , the cuts were intended to motivate Congress to reach a deficit-reduction deal to avoid them .
In separate but similar statements , the White House and Democratic leaders said Boehner 's fallback option would fail to win congressional approval , especially in the Democratically controlled Senate .
Facing an insistent Obama and pressure from some in his own party , Boehner already had conceded on higher tax rates for wealthy Americans as part of the broader talks on an agreement to reduce the nation 's chronic federal deficits and debt .
His plan B proposal Tuesday further demonstrated the lack of leverage Republicans have on the issue .
Obama has made clear that allowing tax rates to go up on top income brackets was a non-negotiable demand to ensure that the wealthy contribute more to deficit reduction .
Under Obama 's plan , which polls consistently show has strong public support , tax rates from the Bush era would be extended for families who earn less than $ 250,000 . The higher rates of the 1990s would be assessed on incomes above that threshold .
As part of the broader talks , Obama on Monday raised the threshold for the higher tax rates to $ 400,000 . The Boehner proposal would set the threshold at $ 1 million .
Democrats claimed Boehner made the plan B offer because he knows he ca n't get conservative House Republicans to back the agreement he is negotiating with the president .
`` The Republicans in the House have rejected their own speaker 's proposal at this stage , '' Rep. Xavier Becerra of California told reporters . `` So , this stage it seems like the real negotiation and fight is among Republicans . ''
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said Boehner 's backup plan appeared to be a result of pressure from tea party conservatives opposing a wider deal .
`` It would be a shame if Republicans abandoned productive negotiations due to pressure from the tea party , as they have time and again , '' Reid said .
Boehner 's spokesman , Michael Steel , shot back that the plan B proposal gave Democrats exactly what they wanted -- higher tax rates on millionaires . He noted the Senate passed a similar measure in 2010 , saying that to oppose Boehner 's plan now would make Democrats responsible for failing to avoid the fiscal cliff .
That brought a response from a spokesman for Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer of New York , who came up with the 2010 compromise that never won House approval .
Since the 2010 vote , `` we 've had an election on the president 's tax plan , the president won , and Republicans ca n't turn the clock back , '' said the spokesman , Brian Fallons .
`` It 's not surprising Republicans are having buyer 's remorse , but we need higher revenues now , '' Fallons said . `` The more revenue we raise upfront through a tax rate increase on the wealthy , the less likely the middle class will get hit on the deduction side . ''
Carney made a similar point , telling reporters that Obama wants to lock in the increased revenue from higher tax rates on top income brackets now . Expected negotiations next year on a broader reform of the tax system would be `` revenue neutral , '' meaning the changes would result in no increase or decrease of overall tax revenue , Carney said .
Conservatives trying to shrink the federal government generally oppose increasing tax revenue . They are particularly opposed to higher tax rates because history shows that once rates go up , it is difficult to later reduce government revenue by lowering them again .
Obama and Democrats argue that increased revenue , including higher tax rates on the wealthy , must be part of broader deficit reduction to prevent the middle class from getting hit too hard .
The president previously said that once Republicans agreed to higher tax rates on wealthy Americans , he would be willing to compromise on spending cuts and entitlement reforms sought by Boehner as part of what the president calls a balanced approach .
Obama 's latest offer brought the two sides billions of dollars closer , but it also generated protests from the liberal base of the Democratic Party because it included some benefit cuts in entitlement programs such as Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid .
Justin Ruben , executive director of MoveOn , the liberal movement that backed Obama 's presidential campaigns , said the group 's members would consider any benefit cuts `` a betrayal that sells out working and middle-class families . ''
In particular , he cited concessions that Obama made in his Monday counteroffer , including a new formula for the consumer price index applied to benefits .
`` If such a deal were proposed by the president and speaker , MoveOn members would expect every Senate and House Democrat to do everything in their power to block it , '' Ruben said . A litany of other progressive groups and politicians also expressed their opposition to what is known as chained CPI .
Carney , however , said Obama 's latest proposal includes a provision `` that would protect vulnerable communities including the very elderly when it comes to Social Security recipients . '' He called the president 's acceptance of the chained CPI a signal of his willingness to compromise to reach a deal .
The chained CPI includes assumptions on consumer habits with regard to rising prices , such as seeking cheaper alternatives , and would result in smaller benefit increases in future years . Labor unions and advocacy groups for the elderly oppose it .
Over the weekend , Boehner offered for the first time to accept tax-rate increases on household income of $ 1 million and above , sources said . The speaker also offered to allow the president to raise the debt ceiling in 2013 without a messy political fight , another key Obama demand .
In response , Obama on Monday offered $ 200 million in new cuts to discretionary federal government spending , divided evenly between defense and nondefense programs .
The president also included for the first time the chained CPI sought by Republicans , and dropped an extension of a payroll tax cut from the past two years .
According to the source who provided CNN with details of Obama 's counteroffer , it includes $ 1.2 trillion in revenue increases and $ 1.22 trillion in spending reductions .
`` The White House offer yesterday was essentially $ 1.3 trillion in new revenues for only $ 850 billion in net spending reductions , '' he said . `` That 's not balanced in my opinion . ''
Obama 's latest proposal included $ 130 billion in spending savings due to changes in the CPI .
However , Republican aides estimate that the CPI would increase tax revenues by an additional $ 95 billion over Obama 's estimated $ 1.2 trillion , putting the total revenue figure of the president 's latest proposal closer to $ 1.3 trillion .
The GOP aides also do not count Obama 's estimated $ 290 billion in savings on national debt interest accumulation because they do not consider these savings real cuts . Therefore , the Republican aides said , Obama 's plan fails to offer a 1-1 ratio of spending cuts and revenue that Boehner would consider balanced .
Carney took exception to the Republican math , telling reporters Tuesday that counting reduced interest on national debt was a legitimate savings counted in budget plans by both parties for years .
Obama and Boehner met face to face at the White House on Monday for 45 minutes , their third such meeting in eight days in a sign of an acceleration in the fiscal cliff negotiations . They also spoke by phone later Monday .

Speaker Boehner offers higher tax rates on millionaires as a back-up plan

Boehner says Americans don't need more stress after the school shooting

The president wants the higher rates to apply to income above $250,000

In the chess match of the fiscal cliff negotiations, President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner are narrowing the divide between their positions while contending with discontent among their respective ranks.

Boehner on Tuesday proposed what recently was the unthinkable for Republicans -- letting tax rates go up on income above $1 million as a short-term step to avoid some of the fiscal cliff while continuing to negotiate a broader deal.

The White House and Democratic leaders immediately rejected Boehner's move, saying the focus should be on a comprehensive deficit-reduction agreement instead of a partial step that no one likes.

It was the latest in a series of concessions by both sides since last week's school shooting in Connecticut that killed 20 youngsters.

Asked if the massacre affected what had been incremental negotiations, Boehner said: ""I think both sides would agree to that.""

""This is a difficult time for Americans,"" he said, adding that ""it's not a time to put Americans through more stress.""

At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney acknowledged that the Newtown tragedy had affected all Americans and ""reminds us what really matters,"" but he stopped short of saying it had directly impacted the talks.

""It's obviously hard to know what the impact of an event like that is on the way that lawmakers and others in Washington approach other issues,"" Carney told reporters. He later added, ""To the extent that an event like that, as tragic as it is, brings us a little closer together, both in the nation and in Washington, that would be a good thing, but it's hard to measure an impact like that.""

The latest back-and-forth in the negotiations came two weeks from the end of the year, when automatic tax increases and spending cuts of the fiscal cliff will take effect.

At a news conference after meeting with House members Tuesday, Boehner called his new proposal a ""plan B"" to prevent tax rates from rising on everyone next year as part of the fiscal cliff.

The Ohio Republican told reporters it was important to have a ""backup plan"" to hold down most tax rates while continuing to negotiate a broader agreement. A Republican source told CNN that Boehner's plan B also would include GOP priorities to make permanent the current estate tax and alternative minimum tax.

While addressing part of the fiscal cliff, the Boehner plan B would leave intact government spending cuts, including defense, that are required under a budget deal reached last year to raise the federal debt ceiling. Known as sequestration, the cuts were intended to motivate Congress to reach a deficit-reduction deal to avoid them.

In separate but similar statements, the White House and Democratic leaders said Boehner's fallback option would fail to win congressional approval, especially in the Democratically controlled Senate.

Facing an insistent Obama and pressure from some in his own party, Boehner already had conceded on higher tax rates for wealthy Americans as part of the broader talks on an agreement to reduce the nation's chronic federal deficits and debt.

His plan B proposal Tuesday further demonstrated the lack of leverage Republicans have on the issue.

Obama has made clear that allowing tax rates to go up on top income brackets was a non-negotiable demand to ensure that the wealthy contribute more to deficit reduction.

Under Obama's plan, which polls consistently show has strong public support, tax rates from the Bush era would be extended for families who earn less than $250,000. The higher rates of the 1990s would be assessed on incomes above that threshold.

As part of the broader talks, Obama on Monday raised the threshold for the higher tax rates to $400,000. The Boehner proposal would set the threshold at $1 million.

Democrats claimed Boehner made the plan B offer because he knows he can't get conservative House Republicans to back the agreement he is negotiating with the president.

""The Republicans in the House have rejected their own speaker's proposal at this stage,"" Rep. Xavier Becerra of California told reporters. ""So, this stage it seems like the real negotiation and fight is among Republicans.""

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said Boehner's backup plan appeared to be a result of pressure from tea party conservatives opposing a wider deal.

""It would be a shame if Republicans abandoned productive negotiations due to pressure from the tea party, as they have time and again,"" Reid said.

Boehner's spokesman, Michael Steel, shot back that the plan B proposal gave Democrats exactly what they wanted -- higher tax rates on millionaires. He noted the Senate passed a similar measure in 2010, saying that to oppose Boehner's plan now would make Democrats responsible for failing to avoid the fiscal cliff.

That brought a response from a spokesman for Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, who came up with the 2010 compromise that never won House approval.

Since the 2010 vote, ""we've had an election on the president's tax plan, the president won, and Republicans can't turn the clock back,"" said the spokesman, Brian Fallons.

""It's not surprising Republicans are having buyer's remorse, but we need higher revenues now,"" Fallons said. ""The more revenue we raise upfront through a tax rate increase on the wealthy, the less likely the middle class will get hit on the deduction side.""

Carney made a similar point, telling reporters that Obama wants to lock in the increased revenue from higher tax rates on top income brackets now. Expected negotiations next year on a broader reform of the tax system would be ""revenue neutral,"" meaning the changes would result in no increase or decrease of overall tax revenue, Carney said.

Carney, however, said Obama's latest proposal includes a provision ""that would protect vulnerable communities including the very elderly when it comes to Social Security recipients."" He called the president's acceptance of the chained CPI a signal of his willingness to compromise to reach a deal.

The chained CPI includes assumptions on consumer habits with regard to rising prices, such as seeking cheaper alternatives, and would result in smaller benefit increases in future years. Labor unions and advocacy groups for the elderly oppose it.

In response, Obama on Monday offered $200 million in new cuts to discretionary federal government spending, divided evenly between defense and nondefense programs.

The president also included for the first time the chained CPI sought by Republicans, and dropped an extension of a payroll tax cut from the past two years.

According to the source who provided CNN with details of Obama's counteroffer, it includes $1.2 trillion in revenue increases and $1.22 trillion in spending reductions.

However, Boehner disputed those figures Tuesday.

""The White House offer yesterday was essentially $1.3 trillion in new revenues for only $850 billion in net spending reductions,"" he said. ""That's not balanced in my opinion.""

Obama's latest proposal included $130 billion in spending savings due to changes in the CPI.

However, Republican aides estimate that the CPI would increase tax revenues by an additional $95 billion over Obama's estimated $1.2 trillion, putting the total revenue figure of the president's latest proposal closer to $1.3 trillion.

It is not clear whether the Boehner plan is a serious alternative or primarily a bargaining tactic to extract more concessions from Mr. Obama. Rob Nabors, the president’s chief liaison to Congress, met with House Democrats on Tuesday and said talks were moving forward.

But privately, he expressed pessimism that Mr. Boehner could sign on to any deal, according to people familiar with those conversations.

It would be a shame if Republicans abandoned productive negotiations due to pressure from the Tea Party, as they have time and again.”

The president said Monday that he would come down to $1.2 trillion in tax increases over 10 years from his initial $1.6 trillion. He also said tax rates should rise on incomes over $400,000 a year, up from the $250,000 level he has pushed for more than four years.

The White House says its offer amounts to $1.2 trillion in tax increases and $1.22 trillion in spending cuts. Mr. Boehner says the real balance is $1.3 trillion in higher taxes and $850 billion in spending cuts. That is because the White House is counting $290 billion in lower interest costs on a smaller national debt as “spending cuts” and is not counting higher taxes that would be paid if, as Mr. Obama wants, a new method of calculating inflation is instituted.

In past deficit deals, including last summer’s agreement that set up the automatic spending cuts to force a broader budget accord, Mr. Boehner had also counted interest savings as a spending cut.

But while most of the political world frets as if a major disaster is looming , others have treated it more like the Y2K bug : a fiscal canard ginning up a lot of unnecessary panic .
The cliff is a `` fantasy , '' former House speaker Newt Gingrich told a sold-out crowd at the Ronald Reagan library in Simi Valley , Calif. , a week before Election Day .
`` It is an excuse to panic , '' Gingrich said . `` It is a device to get all of us running down the road so we accept whatever Obama wants , because otherwise we will have failed the fiscal cliff , and how can you be a patriot if you do n't do what the fiscal cliff requires ? ''
The former speaker wanted Republicans to stop negotiating with President Obama , for fear of giving too much away . `` Back out of all of this negotiating with Obama , '' Gingrich publicly advised House Republicans . `` The president is overwhelmingly dominant in the news media '' but , at the opposite end of the political spectrum , liberals have said the same thing for a similar reason .
While the `` cliff '' would mean higher taxes on the middle class , it would also mean higher taxes on the wealthy , a chief demand for liberals . Automatic budget cuts would hit defense programs , which liberals have wanted to cut anyway , but not the Medicare and Social Security entitlements that Democrats and progressives want so badly to protect .
Van Jones , the environmental activist and resigned White House green jobs `` czar , '' sought to quiet the `` fiscal cliff '' alarms Election Night on CNN . `` The problem with the label 'the cliff ' is that it creates a mindset that there is nothing worse that this set of cuts , and there are things that are worse , '' Jones said .
`` We can not be in a situation where we get bullied or stampeded into putting in a deal that 's even worse than what the fiscal cliff is about . ''
Jones later wrote on his blog that the `` fiscal cliff '' is actually a `` fiscal bluff '' : `` The so-called fiscal cliff is actually a fiscal bluff -- - a made-up crisis to make us think our government is out of money and time . Congress continues to drag its feet over raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans , despite the top 1 % earning 23 % of the nation 's income , and insists on calling for cuts to vital programs instead of reining in massive subsidies ( $ 100 billion in 2011 alone ) to major corporations that already make billions in profits .
`` America is n't broke -- - it 's being robbed . Gingrich and Jones started the conversation , but as the deadline creeps closer , others are finishing it . ''
`` Democratic and progressive leverage goes immensely up if we get past the beginning of the year , '' Adam Green of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee told ███ . `` Once they have to proactively lower taxes on the rich , it makes it harder and harder to move that number up and makes it easier and easier to force votes or demand votes on policies that clearly benefit the middle class . ''
Green says liberals will get what they want immediately , if the Dec. 31 deadline passes without a deal .
`` We really want to get past the first of the year so that we have that leverage in the bag , '' Green told ABC . `` It will also show that the fiscal cliff was a myth . If we get into 2013 , the really good stuff happens right away , and the really big cuts are a 10-year phase-in . ''
Green 's group is n't the only one that feels this way .
`` There 's no question that the spending cuts and tax hikes set to be triggered January 1 would harm poor and middle class families , but the radical approach being pushed by Republicans is even worse , '' MoveOn.org spokesman Nick Berning told ███ via email .
`` Democrats must not agree to the GOP 's proposal to cut Social Security benefits through the chained CPI -- it would be too harmful to seniors . Democrats including President Obama must stand up for the poor and middle class by standing strong against any Social Security , Medicare , or Medicaid benefit cuts . ''
On both sides , fiscal brinksmanship has revealed a willingness to reject deals right up until the deadline .
Rep. Tim Huelskamp , R-Kansas , took to a podium outside the Capitol this week to say that Republicans voting for House Speaker John Boehner 's `` Plan B '' proposal deserve to be challenged in primaries . While that 's not the same as denying that the `` cliff '' is so terrible , such resistance to compromise implies a willingness to walk very close to the edge .
After that plan 's failure , it appears more likely that the liberal wish will come true , and that conservatives like Huelskamp wo n't have to explain the drawbacks of compromise to their constituents .","Not everyone thinks the ""fiscal cliff"" is so bad.

If the Dec. 31 deadline passes, income taxes will go up and across-the-board spending cuts will hit government programs. But while most of the political world frets as if a major disaster is looming, others have treated it more like the Y2K bug: a fiscal canard ginning up a lot of unnecessary panic.

Fiscal Cliff 'Plan B' Is Dead: Now What?

The former speaker wanted Republicans to stop negotiating with President Obama, for fear of giving too much away. ""Back out of all of this negotiating with Obama,"" Gingrich publicly advised House Republicans. ""The president is overwhelmingly dominant in the news media"" but, at the opposite end of the political spectrum, liberals have said the same thing for a similar reason.

Automatic budget cuts would hit defense programs, which liberals have wanted to cut anyway, but not the Medicare and Social Security entitlements that Democrats and progressives want so badly to protect.

Boehner Pulls 'Plan B' Amid GOP Disarray

Van Jones, the environmental activist and resigned White House green jobs ""czar,"" sought to quiet the ""fiscal cliff"" alarms Election Night on CNN. ""The problem with the label 'the cliff' is that it creates a mindset that there is nothing worse that this set of cuts, and there are things that are worse,"" Jones said.

""We cannot be in a situation where we get bullied or stampeded into putting in a deal that's even worse than what the fiscal cliff is about.""

Jones later wrote on his blog that the ""fiscal cliff"" is actually a ""fiscal bluff"": ""The so-called fiscal cliff is actually a fiscal bluff --- a made-up crisis to make us think our government is out of money and time. Congress continues to drag its feet over raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans, despite the top 1% earning 23% of the nation's income, and insists on calling for cuts to vital programs instead of reining in massive subsidies ($100 billion in 2011 alone) to major corporations that already make billions in profits.

""America isn't broke --- it's being robbed. Gingrich and Jones started the conversation, but as the deadline creeps closer, others are finishing it.""

To some, the ""fiscal cliff"" offers a clearer upside.

""Democratic and progressive leverage goes immensely up if we get past the beginning of the year,"" Adam Green of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee told ABC News. ""Once they have to proactively lower taxes on the rich, it makes it harder and harder to move that number up and makes it easier and easier to force votes or demand votes on policies that clearly benefit the middle class.""

Green says liberals will get what they want immediately, if the Dec. 31 deadline passes without a deal.

""We really want to get past the first of the year so that we have that leverage in the bag,"" Green told ABC. ""It will also show that the fiscal cliff was a myth. If we get into 2013, the really good stuff happens right away, and the really big cuts are a 10-year phase-in.""

Green's group isn't the only one that feels this way.

""There's no question that the spending cuts and tax hikes set to be triggered January 1 would harm poor and middle class families, but the radical approach being pushed by Republicans is even worse,"" MoveOn.org spokesman Nick Berning told ABC News via email.

""Democrats must not agree to the GOP's proposal to cut Social Security benefits through the chained CPI--it would be too harmful to seniors. Democrats including President Obama must stand up for the poor and middle class by standing strong against any Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid benefit cuts.""

On both sides, fiscal brinksmanship has revealed a willingness to reject deals right up until the deadline.

Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kansas, took to a podium outside the Capitol this week to say that Republicans voting for House Speaker John Boehner's ""Plan B"" proposal deserve to be challenged in primaries. While that's not the same as denying that the ""cliff"" is so terrible, such resistance to compromise implies a willingness to walk very close to the edge.

After that plan's failure, it appears more likely that the liberal wish will come true, and that conservatives like Huelskamp won't have to explain the drawbacks of compromise to their constituents.

`` The problem is the ideological pinnings on both sides of this argument are so difficult to bridge , '' Smith said , adding it will `` be hard for them to get a deal . ''
Polls show that more Americans will blame Republicans , instead of Obama and Democrats , if there is no deal and the nation goes over the fiscal cliff .
A Washington Post/Pew Research Center survey released Tuesday put the margin at 53 % -27 % in citing Republicans or Obama . A CNN/ORC International poll released last week showed 45 % would blame congressional Republicans compared to 34 % who would blame Obama .

Once that happens , Obama and Democratic leaders promise , they will work out compromises on other deficit reduction steps sought by Republicans , such as reforms to the Medicare and Medicaid entitlement programs as part of further spending cuts .
In an interview with Bloomberg TV broadcast Tuesday , Obama said Republicans need to accept the reality that deficit reduction requires higher tax rates on the wealthy .

`` The issue right now , that is relevant , is the acknowledgment that if we 're going to raise revenues that are sufficient to balance with the very tough cuts that we have already made and the future reforms in entitlements that I 'm prepared to make , then we are going to have to see the rates on the top 2 % go up , `` the president said . `` We will not be able to get a deal without it . ''
House Republicans led by Boehner made a major counter-proposal Monday , offering a series of steps to reduce the nation 's chronic federal deficits by $ 2.2 trillion over 10 years .
The GOP leaders gave ground by calling for $ 800 billion in deficit reduction through tax reform , including an unspecified amount from eliminating some deductions and loopholes .
At the same time , they rejected the Democratic call for higher tax rates on wealthier Americans , contending the move would inhibit economic growth by raising taxes on small business owners , many of whom declare business profits on their personal income tax returns .
On Tuesday , leading conservatives blasted the House Republican proposal that breaks with years of GOP orthodoxy by calling for more taxes to be paid by wealthier Americans .
But in a sign of how politically treacherous and awkward the offer has become , top Senate Republicans -- many of them conservatives -- withheld harsh criticism of the plan even as they refused to embrace it . In fact , despite their general misgivings about approving tax increases , they gently nudged negotiations forward , in apparent recognition that any final agreement would include higher taxes -- at least in some form -- as Obama demands .
Sen. Jim DeMint , R-South Carolina , said the `` offer of an $ 800 billion tax hike will destroy jobs and allow politicians in Washington to spend even more . '' Sen. Rand Paul , R-Kentucky , said it would be `` a huge mistake to raise taxes . It will cripple the economy . ''
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell , meanwhile , sidestepped the question when at a press conference he was asked directly if he backed the plan .
`` I commend the House Republican leadership for trying to move the process along and getting to a point where , hopefully , we can have a real discussion , '' he said .
Charles Grassley of Iowa , a senior Republican on the Finance Committee , was one of a only a few GOP senators who said he would support Boehner 's plan to raise revenue , but only if there is a `` willingness on the part of Democrats to accept spending cuts that are three to one or four to one . ''
In a statement Tuesday , Boehner said Obama continued to offer solutions that had no chance of winning approval in the House or the Democratic-controlled Senate .
`` If the president really wants to avoid sending the economy over the fiscal cliff , he has done nothing to demonstrate it , '' said Boehner , R-Ohio .
The White House and Democratic leaders immediately rejected the Republican approach , saying it would require middle-class taxpayers to assume a greater burden while easing rates on the rich .
`` While their proposal may be serious , it is also a non-starter , '' Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said Tuesday . `` They know any agreement that raises taxes on the middle class in order to protect more unnecessary giveaways for the top 2 % is doomed from the start . ''
White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters that the Republican stance represented progress , `` but is not enough progress to achieve a deal . ''
Conservative Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma predicted rejection of the GOP proposal would doom any chance of an agreement .
`` I 'm certain that if this is not good enough for the White House , we will go over the fiscal cliff , '' Coburn told CNN Monday night , adding the GOP offer was a compromise on taxes and spending compared to previous negotiations of the past two years .
The Republican offer was signed by Boehner , House Republican leader Eric Cantor and the chairmen of committees involved in budgeting and tax issues .
All have taken part in the various rounds of negotiations with the White House and congressional Democrats since 2010 , including failed deficit reduction talks , debt ceiling brinksmanship that sparked last year 's unprecedented downgrade of the U.S. credit rating , and a special committee that was unable to reach agreement on a deficit reduction plan .
Obama 's re-election and Democratic retention of their Senate majority last month ensured their side 's participants in the fiscal cliff talks would remain the same .
The current negotiations take place amid the lame-duck session of Congress before the newly elected legislators arrive in January . Possible outcomes include an agreement now to avoid the fiscal cliff and devise a framework for further negotiations in the new Congress on a broader deficit reduction deal .
Coburn , however , worried that politics will continue to trump reason in Washington .
`` I 'm okay to compromise even on some of my issues if in fact we 'll solve the problem , '' he said Monday night . `` But what we have is a game being played ... for the extreme right wing and the extreme left wing in this country rather than coming together and leading and solving the problem . ''
The GOP proposal includes $ 800 billion from tax reform , $ 600 billion from Medicare reforms and other health savings and $ 600 billion in other spending cuts , House Republican leadership aides said . It also pledges $ 200 billion in savings by revising the consumer price index , a measure of inflation .
White House spokesman Dan Pfeiffer criticized the Republican offer for not meeting `` the test of balance . ''
`` Until the Republicans in Congress are willing to get serious about asking the wealthiest to pay slightly higher tax rates , we wo n't be able to achieve a significant , balanced approach to reduce our deficit , '' Pfeiffer said .
The White House has made clear Obama will veto any measure that fails to increase tax rates on the wealthy . However , aides have signaled a possible willingness to negotiate the specific rate increase .
Asked repeatedly Tuesday about whether Obama insisted on a return to the 1990s rates on income over $ 250,000 for families or $ 200,000 for individuals , Carney responded by saying the president would refuse to sign any measure extending the current lower rates .
In the interview with Bloomberg TV , Obama said lower tax rates for the wealthy could be negotiated as part of broader tax reform in 2013 , but only after those rates increase now .
Republicans offered the plan amid pressure for a House vote -- which Boehner has so far prevented -- on the Senate measure . Democrats launched a procedural effort Tuesday to try to force a vote .
In line with his stances during his first term and reelection campaign , Obama 's deficit-reduction plan would increase taxes by almost $ 1 trillion over 10 years , a significant portion of a $ 4 trillion overall deficit-reduction goal .
It also would close loopholes , limit deductions , raise the estate tax rate to 2009 levels and increases tax rates on capital gains and dividends . The Obama plan includes $ 50 billion in stimulus spending for programs intended to create jobs , such as repairing roads and bridges .
Republicans object to any increase in tax rates , even for the wealthiest Americans . Instead , they want additional revenue to come from broader tax reform that lowers rates but eliminates loopholes and deductions .
Democrats respond that closing some tax loopholes for the wealthy would fail to generate enough revenue to contribute significantly to deficit reduction . Coburn , however , rejected that argument .
`` That 's baloney , '' he said . `` It 's easy to get $ 800 billion out of the wealthy in this country by limiting deductions and taking away options that specifically benefit only the well-off in this country . ''
Experts have said failing to reach a fiscal cliff deal and devise a framework for a broader deficit reduction package to be negotiated when the new Congress is seated in January will cause economic turmoil . The non-partisan Tax Policy Center estimates that middle-class families would pay about $ 2,000 a year more in taxes without action .","Story highlights President Obama reiterates his call for higher tax rates on the wealthy

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio declared in an exclusive Newsmax TV interview that the nation’s middle-class consumers will be hardest hit by President Barack Obama’s proposed tax increases.“When you raise taxes, the money has to come out of the private economy,” Rubio, the first-term GOP senator, tells Newsmax. “It’s coming out of a business somewhere, whose taxes are going to go up.“So how do businesses react?

Boehner and force a House vote on extending the Bush-era tax cuts for everyone except individuals making $ 200,000 and more and couples making $ 250,000 .
Such a vote would give Republicans who want to abandon the speaker and the GOP “ no-higher-tax-rates ” position a chance to buck party leaders and cut their own deal with Democrats to avert the “ fiscal cliff ” — the automatic spending cuts and tax increases that will take effect in January .
No Republicans have signed or said they would sign the petition , but Democrats are optimistic they can find more than two dozen GOP lawmakers needed to send the stalled bill to the floor for a vote — especially if negotiations between the president and Mr. Boehner remain stalled .
“ The discharge petition , while we do want to get it to the [ House ] floor , it can also be a catalyst to move people , ” said Rep. Timothy J. Walz , a Minnesota Democrat who filed the petition on behalf of his party . “ It sends a signal to [ House Speaker John A . ] Boehner that , if he gets a few of his members on it , it maybe frees him up for a little bit of negotiating . ”
The petition calls for House action on a bill that passed the Democrat-controlled Senate this year that would keep George W. Bush-era tax cuts in place for individuals earning up to $ 200,000 and couples making up to $ 250,000 . For those earning more — about 2 percent of taxpayers — the tax breaks would expire as scheduled in January .
Republicans have expressed little interest in the measure and say they want the tax breaks extended to all income levels .
Democrats were inspired in part to try the unconventional approach after Rep. Tom Cole , Oklahoma Republican , last month said he would be willing to let the tax cuts expire for the nation ’ s most wealthy as a way to help avoid the looming “ fiscal cliff . ”
Rep. Walter B. Jones , a moderate Republican from North Carolina , also said he would consider signing the petition .
Discharge petitions require a simple majority of the House ’ s 435 members , or 218 votes , to advance a stalled bill toward a full floor vote . If all of the chamber ’ s 191 Democrats sign Mr. Walz ’ s petition , the support of 27 Republicans would be needed to get the bill to the House floor .
If the required signatures are secured this week , the earliest likely day that the bill could be brought to the floor under House rules is Dec. 24 .
Thirteen Democrats haven ’ t signed the petition , which was filed Tuesday . Mr. Walz said he expects most , if not all , Democrats to give their support . He noted that many who haven ’ t done so were out of town last week and said no Democrat has refused to sign the petition .
Getting “ the 191 Democrats on it , that ’ s great , that ’ s nice , that shows unity . But the real story is when you get the first Republican , ” Mr. Walz said . “ There are some [ Republican ] members that might simply see this as a way to kind of change the debate . ”
Mr. Walz said the petition isn ’ t meant to shame or coerce rank-and-file House Republicans to accept a tax deal against their party leaders ’ wishes . Rather , he said , it offers a generally nonconfrontational path for Republicans who quietly agree with the Democratic measure .
“ I ’ m very cognizant that this is very difficult vote for a lot of colleagues , and I ’ m not gleeful in twisting that in anymore , ” he said . “ I want to reach a compromise that works for everybody . ”

Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said there is no way enough House Republicans will defy the speaker and sign the petition .
“ Democrats like to talk about a lot about arithmetic these days , but clearly the arithmetic with the discharge petition doesn ’ t work , ” Mr. Steel said .

Sen. Harry Reid says of Boehner : `` I do n't understand his brain ''
After two years of endless debate and a national election , Democrats and Republicans on Thursday found themselves right where they started -- blaming each other for stagnant negotiations on taxes and government spending .
House Speaker John Boehner declared himself disappointed that `` no substantive progress '' has occurred in two weeks of talks , saying Republicans were waiting for the White House to propose significant spending cuts .
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid responded to Boehner by telling reporters : `` I do n't understand his brain . ''
The stakes are high this time , as the nation faces an imminent deadline for automatic tax increases and spending cuts -- the looming fiscal cliff at the end of the year that economists fear could cause another recession .
After meeting separately with President Barack Obama 's point man on the talks , the top congressional Democrats and Republicans said the failure to move forward was the other side 's fault .

Obama `` has to get serious , '' Boehner told reporters following his discussion with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner . `` It 's very clear what kind of spending cuts need to occur , but we have no idea what the White House is willing to do . ''
Senate Democrats said Boehner had it backward because Obama has made his positions clear -- especially his call to extend middle-class tax cuts while allowing rates on the wealthiest 2 % of Americans to return to higher rates of the 1990s .
Some specifics of the White House plan became clear later Thursday .
A Republican congressional aide familiar with the proposal said it calls for $ 1.6 trillion in tax increases .
`` All of that upfront -- in exchange for only $ 400 billion in spending cuts that come later , '' said the aide , calling the offer `` completely unbalanced and unrealistic . ''
Republican aides said the $ 1.6 trillion was higher than previously discussed . Democrats said the number should not be a surprise , adding Obama discussed it on the campaign trail .
A senior House GOP aide said Geithner , among other things , proposed an increase in top marginal rates as well as on capital gains and dividends , totaling about $ 960 billion . Additional tax increases would amount to $ 600 billion , the aide said . Several senior GOP aides said the White House plan was a step in the wrong direction .
A Democrat familiar with the talks says the administration proposal includes closing loopholes and deductions .
The plan includes $ 50 billion in stimulus spending and a home mortgage refinancing package , a Republican aide told CNN . Obama would work on $ 400 billion savings in Medicare and other entitlements next year , without specifying where they 'd come from , the aide says .
The White House , after the Geithner meeting , said the president has previously signed $ 1 trillion in spending cuts into law .
`` It 's time for Republicans in Washington to join the chorus of other voices -- from the business community to middle class Americans across the country -- who support a balanced approach that asks more from the wealthiest Americans , '' the White House said in a statement .
White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama 's insistence on having wealthy Americans pay a higher tax rate was the president 's consistent message throughout his first term , and especially during his successful re-election campaign .
`` We remain optimistic that this can get done , but the president 's principles are clear , '' Carney said . `` It 's not like we did n't have this debate for the last year . ''
Both Republicans and Democrats insist they want a comprehensive agreement to tackle the nation 's chronic federal deficits and debt , starting with a deal to avoid automatic tax hikes and spending cuts set to take effect on January 1 .
However , the two sides appear far apart on the timing of taking those steps . The dispute over how to proceed is compounded by the lame-duck Congress , which is completing its work before a new legislature gets seated in January .
Obama and Democrats are pushing hard for House Republicans to immediately pass a Senate bill that would prevent most of the automatic tax increases that would result from the expiration of Bush-era tax cuts at the end of the year .
At the same time , they want to discuss a framework for substantive negotiations in the new Congress that would include tax reform , spending cuts and reforms of popular entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid .
Republicans , led by Boehner , oppose letting tax rates on the wealthiest 2 % of Americans go up by passing the Senate bill championed by Obama . They also want Democrats to make firm commitments on spending cuts and entitlement reforms now , instead of waiting for negotiations next year .
`` I 'm disappointed in where we are . I 'm disappointed over what 's happened in the last couple of weeks , '' Boehner said of talks since he and other congressional leaders met with Obama on November 16 , 10 days after the president 's re-election . `` But going over the fiscal cliff is serious business . I 'm here seriously trying to resolve it , and I hope the White House would get serious as well . ''
Boehner described his talks with Geithner as `` frank '' and `` direct '' and also said he had a `` straightforward '' telephone call with Obama on Wednesday . His assessment of no real progress was based on both of those discussions , said the Ohio Republican .
`` No substantive progress has been made in the talks between the White House and the House over the last two weeks , '' Boehner said .
Differences between the parties include the scope of a deficit deal , with Republicans insisting that Social Security reforms be part of it while Democrats say the government pension system is self-funded and therefore plays no role in federal deficits .
Obama also wants any deal reached in the current session of Congress to include an increase in the federal debt ceiling , which is expected to be needed as soon as February or March .
To Boehner and Republicans , the debt ceiling is a valuable negotiating tool to extract concessions from the Democrats and the president .
`` Any increase in the debt limit has to be accomplished by spending reductions that meet or exceed it , '' Boehner declared Thursday , saying Obama would have to pay a price to raise the ceiling on federal borrowing .
Carney responded to Boehner 's demand of a price by calling such brinksmanship over the credit standing of the nation `` entirely inappropriate . ''
`` Asking that a political price be paid in order for Congress to do its job to ensure that the United States of America pays its bill and does not default for the first time in history is deeply irresponsible , '' Carney said .
A similar battle over the debt ceiling , with threats of a government default on its obligations , led to the unprecedented downgrade of the U.S. credit rating last year by one agency .
Geithner is the Obama administration 's point man in the talks . His separate meetings on Thursday with Boehner , House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi , Reid and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell also included Rob Nabors , Obama 's legislative affairs director .
Fresh off his re-election victory on November 6 , Obama launched a campaign-style approach this week aimed at pressuring Republicans to pass his tax proposal .
In remarks Wednesday at the White House , Obama urged Americans to call , e-mail and tweet their members of Congress to urge immediate passage of his proposal to extend tax cuts for most Americans while allowing rates on the wealthiest 2 % to increase to 1990s levels .
Obama 's phone conservation with Boehner later Wednesday lasted 28 minutes , Carney said . A source familiar with the call said the president insisted any deal must include tax rates going up on the wealthiest Americans , a point Carney repeatedly emphasized to reporters Thursday .
Meanwhile , a rift among House Republicans on whether to give Obama what he wants became public Wednesday , with two conservatives saying the tax proposal would likely pass if brought to a vote .
Boehner immediately shot down the call by veteran Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma for the chamber to approve the Senate measure , saying he disagrees with his colleague . House GOP aides insisted there is no plan to bring the proposal up for a vote .
However , the public stance by Cole -- which echoed similar statements from conservatives in recent weeks -- as well as his prediction that the Senate proposal would pass in the House showed an increasing desire among House Republicans to move beyond an issue that has harmed them .
Conservative Rep. Tim Scott of South Carolina also said he thinks the Obama tax plan would pass the House , though he made clear to CNN he would oppose it .
Obama made clear Wednesday that he hopes public pressure will cause House Republicans to move from their unyielding stance .
`` The lesson is that when enough people get involved , we have a pretty good track record of making Congress work , '' he said .
Cole and some other conservatives say such pressure is the reason to simply give the president what he wants and move past the immediate tax issue .
`` If we agree that taxes should n't go up on 98 % of the people , should n't we take that now and get that set aside and make sure they know their taxes are n't going up ? '' Cole said Wednesday night on CNN 's `` Anderson Cooper 360 . ''
Sounding a lot like Obama , Cole said that `` if we can give assurance to most Americans that their taxes are going to be fine , I think that 's helpful to them in planning their lives going forward . ''
Obama argued Wednesday that settling the tax question for middle-class families would clear the way for the broader agreement everyone wants .
`` We can do it in a balanced a fair way , but our first job is to make sure that taxes on middle-class families do n't go up , '' Obama said . `` And since we all theoretically agree on that , we should get that done . If we get that done , a lot of the other stuff is going to be a lot easier . ''
Boehner outlined a similar process on Thursday , but demanded more commitment from Obama and Democrats on spending cuts and entitlement reforms .
His framework includes what he called a `` down payment '' for the rest of this year that would include spending cuts and additional tax revenue , but not higher tax rates . That would set up negotiations on tax reform and other aspects of deficit reduction next year , Boehner said .
With the U.S. economy showing more signs of improvement in its long recovery from recession , economists point to fears about higher taxes in 2013 as a potential threat to rising consumer confidence .
The impending fiscal cliff resulted from a failure to reach a deficit reduction agreement in the past two years due to long-standing differences between Democrats and Republicans on taxes -- particularly whether to extend tax cuts from President George W. Bush 's administration .
Republicans seeking to shrink the size of government oppose allowing any tax rates to return to pre-cut levels , arguing that Obama 's plan would hinder job growth because some small business owners who file personal returns would pay higher taxes under it .
Boehner and other influential GOP figures have declared their willingness to consider other ways to boost tax revenue as part of a broader deal that would include entitlement reforms and spending cuts .

fiscal_cliff,CNN (Web News),0,http://money.cnn.com/2012/12/31/news/economy/more-fiscal-cliffs/index.html,3 more fiscal cliffs loom ,2012-12-31,Rich Barbieri,"Think the fiscal cliff caused an awful lot of uncertainty and held back the economy ? How about three more cliff-like deadlines over the next three months ?
That 's what 's in store . The bill approved by the House late Tuesday does n't address the debt ceiling and temporarily puts off most of the automatic spending cuts otherwise scheduled to take effect Wednesday .
1 . Debt Ceiling : Congress has to raise the debt ceiling soon . Real soon .
On Monday , Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner made it official : Federal borrowing has reached the $ 16.394 trillion debt ceiling .
The Treasury Department , which runs the government 's debt-issuance operation , can create about $ 200 billion of headroom by employing what it calls `` extraordinary measures . '' That normally could cover about two months ' worth of borrowing , although continuing uncertainty about tax rates and spending make it hard to determine precisely how long the extraordinary measures will last .
What 's at stake : Last year , political brinksmanship over the debt limit led to the downgrade of the country 's credit rating , roiled stock markets and raised questions about the country 's willingness to pay all of its bills on time . It also wasted $ 1.3 billion because of the uncertainty it wrought on the complex task of federal borrowing .
2 . Sequester : The so-called sequester is a series of automatic cuts in federal spending that will reduce the budgets of most agencies and programs by 8 % to 10 % .
The cuts were born of the epic 2011 fight over the debt ceiling . The idea was to create a `` trigger '' so onerous and indiscriminate that both parties would have an incentive to devise a smarter way to reduce deficits .

What 's at stake : Congress will have to pass yet another continuing resolution to avoid a temporary shutdown of some government functions , worker furloughs and a pullback in programs .","Think the fiscal cliff caused an awful lot of uncertainty and held back the economy? How about three more cliff-like deadlines over the next three months?

That's what's in store. The bill approved by the House late Tuesday doesn't address the debt ceiling and temporarily puts off most of the automatic spending cuts otherwise scheduled to take effect Wednesday.

Here is what's still ahead:

1. Debt Ceiling: Congress has to raise the debt ceiling soon. Real soon.

On Monday, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner made it official: Federal borrowing has reached the $16.394 trillion debt ceiling.

The Treasury Department, which runs the government's debt-issuance operation, can create about $200 billion of headroom by employing what it calls ""extraordinary measures."" That normally could cover about two months' worth of borrowing, although continuing uncertainty about tax rates and spending make it hard to determine precisely how long the extraordinary measures will last.

Deadline: Late February or early March.

What's at stake: Last year, political brinksmanship over the debt limit led to the downgrade of the country's credit rating, roiled stock markets and raised questions about the country's willingness to pay all of its bills on time. It also wasted $1.3 billion because of the uncertainty it wrought on the complex task of federal borrowing.

2. Sequester: The so-called sequester is a series of automatic cuts in federal spending that will reduce the budgets of most agencies and programs by 8% to 10%.

The cuts were born of the epic 2011 fight over the debt ceiling. The idea was to create a ""trigger"" so onerous and indiscriminate that both parties would have an incentive to devise a smarter way to reduce deficits. Instead, 17 months later, Congress is considering a deal that would set up yet another deadline.

Deadline: Bill will postpone many of the Jan. 2 cuts by two months.

What's at stake: The spending cuts as laid out in 2011 would ripple out across thousands of federal programs and projects and, the White House budget office said in September, ""would have a devastating impact on important defense and nondefense programs.""

3. Continuing Budget Resolution: The federal government works on a fiscal year that starts every Oct. 1. Problem is it has been years since it actually enacted a real budget on time.

There's a process for enacting a budget: Congressional committees are supposed to hold hearings. Experts and interested parties testify about proposals. Lawmakers deliberate over the right spending levels for each federal agency and then roll it all up into a budget.

But Congress rarely ends up following that process. Instead, it usually passes short-term ""continuing resolutions,"" which is fancy way of saying ""Band Aid solution.""

Deadline: The current continuing resolution expires on March 27.

What's at stake: Congress will have to pass yet another continuing resolution to avoid a temporary shutdown of some government functions, worker furloughs and a pullback in programs.",www.money.cnn.com,left,TtelfClugcShdBuE

Boehner clearly sought to indicate little progress in the negotiations on an agreement to reduce chronic federal deficits and debt .
However , the latest talks involved counteroffers by both sides that included two shifts by the White House . Democratic sources said Obama lowered his revenue demand from $ 1.6 trillion to $ 1.4 trillion , but also added changes to the corporate rate to his proposal involving income taxes .
No further details were available , but Boehner sounded unimpressed . He told reporters that Obama 's latest stance remained far from a deal that he could accept or would win approval from the House and Senate .
`` There were some offers that were exchanged back and forth yesterday , '' he said , adding that `` the president and I had some pretty frank conversation about how far apart we are . ''
In particular , the Ohio Republican said that Obama 's proposal failed to offer a balance between increased tax revenue and spending cuts promised by the president .
`` In the five weeks since we 've signaled our willingness to forge an agreement with the president , he 's never put forth a plan that meets these standards , '' Boehner said. `` And frankly , it 's why we do n't have an agreement today . ''
The White House and congressional Democrats rejected the Republican contention that the president 's proposal lacked serious spending cuts and reforms to entitlement programs such as Medicare , Medicaid and Social Security as part of a comprehensive deal .
Instead , they said Republicans were the ones making inadequate offers instead of seeking real compromise by agreeing to Obama 's demand to maintain current tax rates for most Americans while allowing an increase on the top two income brackets .
Obama has held a series of campaign-style public events to back his call for extending Bush-era tax cuts for 98 % of Americans , with rates returning to higher 1990s levels on income over $ 250,000 .
That would address the main concern of the fiscal cliff , a set of automatic tax hikes and spending cuts that will begin on January 1 without an agreement between Obama and Boehner .
Republican opposition in the face of support from the White House , Democrats and a majority of Americans , as shown by Obama 's re-election and consistent poll results , showed GOP conservatives were holding hostage the continued tax cuts for the middle class to prevent higher rates on nation 's wealthiest 2 % , argued House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi .
While Republicans have offered to increase tax revenue by eliminating some deductions and loopholes , they so far refuse to accept any increase in tax rates as demanded by the president .
A Democratic source told CNN that the latest Republican offer included extending all the Bush-era tax cuts set to expire at the end of the year , including rates on the top income brackets .
According to the source , that signaled to Democrats that Boehner and Republicans were `` unwilling or unable to do any sort of deal that can pass the Senate or be signed by the president . ''
Obama campaigned on higher taxes on the wealthy in winning re-election last month , and he and Democrats say Republicans must concede on that issue for an agreement to happen .
In an interview on Tuesday with ABC News , Obama said that he was `` pretty confident '' Republicans would relent on taxes in order to get a deal .
At the same time , the White House complained Republicans have yet to offer details on which deductions or loopholes they would eliminate to raise revenue .
It was implausible for Republicans to contend that `` we can somehow magically achieve significant revenue on the order that we need for that balanced deficit reduction package simply by closing loopholes that they will not name or capping deductions that they will not specify some time in the future , '' White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters .
`` Those magic beans are just beans and that fairy dust is just dust , '' he added . `` It is not serious and the president will not sign an extension of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest . ''

`` You ` re talking about having to have something done by Christmas , but the sooner the better , '' Rep. Chris Van Hollen , D-Maryland , told MSNBC on Tuesday .
Polls consistently show the public favors Obama 's stance in the negotiations .
Nearly half of Americans -- 49 % -- say they approve of the president 's handling of the talks , compared to 25 % who say Boehner is doing a good job , according to a new ABC News/Washington Post poll released Wednesday .
Meanwhile , a new Bloomberg National Poll indicated that nearly two-thirds of respondents , including nearly 50 % of Republicans , believe Obama 's re-election gave him a mandate to seek higher taxes on the wealthy .
Also Wednesday , an administration official said the Business Roundtable -- an association of CEOs of major corporations -- has dropped its opposition to raising tax rates on the top two tax brackets after lobbying by the White House .
Despite Boehner 's adamant stance against such a tax rate hike , some cracks have appeared in his party 's anti-tax facade , prompting a conservative backlash .
Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-South Carolina , promised the newly re-elected Obama `` one hell of a fight '' next year if the president forces through his plan for high-income earners to pay more taxes without agreeing to substantive steps to reduce the nation 's chronic federal deficits and debt .
`` There will come a time in February and March where we have to raise the debt ceiling , '' Graham said Tuesday on `` Piers Morgan Tonight '' on CNN . `` I will not raise the debt ceiling ever again until we get significant entitlement reforms , because if we do n't reform entitlements , we 're going to become Greece .

Pelosi , however , argued Tuesday that more than $ 1 trillion in spending cuts agreed to by Congress in the past two years should be counted toward deficit reduction in the current negotiations .
Both sides call for eliminating tax deductions and loopholes to raise more revenue , but Obama also demands an end to the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 for the top brackets .

Tuesday night 's vote prevents tax increases for more than 98 % of Americans
It also staves off $ 110 billion in automatic cuts to domestic and military spending
President Barack Obama has signed into law a bill to avert the fiscal cliff , a day after the House and Senate approved the much-debated legislation .
Obama , who returned to his family vacation in Hawaii after Tuesday 's House vote , signed the bill via autopen on Wednesday .
But new battles over taxes and spending await Washington in the next few weeks .
Congress averted that self-built precipice late Tuesday when the House voted to stave off widespread tax increases and deep spending cuts by accepting a brokered Senate compromise . It makes permanent the Bush administration 's tax cuts for individuals earning less than $ 400,000 per year and couples earning less than $ 450,000 .
It raises rates on those who make more than that from 35 % to 39.6 % , bringing back a top tax bracket from the Clinton administration , and will raise roughly $ 600 billion in new revenues over 10 years , according to various estimates .
The bill also extends unemployment insurance and delays for two months the threat of sequestration -- a series of automatic , across-the-board cuts in federal spending .
Economists had predicted the combination of those tax increases and spending cuts could have thrown the U.S. economy back into recession and driven unemployment back into the 9 % range .
to raise the federal debt ceiling and what to do about the still-hanging sequester -- a legacy of the last battle over the debt ceiling , in 2011 . Meanwhile , a new Congress takes office on Thursday , and lawmakers will soon be confronted by the needto raise the federal debt ceiling and what to do about the still-hanging sequester -- a legacy of the last battle over the debt ceiling , in 2011 .
`` The sum total of all the budget agreements we 've reached so far proves that there is a path forward that is possible , if we focus not on our politics but on what 's right for the country , '' Obama told reporters late Tuesday , after the House approved the fiscal cliff deal . `` And the one thing that I think , hopefully , in the new year , we 'll focus on is seeing if we can put a package like this together with a little bit less drama , a little less brinksmanship , not scare the heck out of folks quite as much .

Tuesday night 's 257-167 vote saw Boehner , R-Ohio , and about a third of the GOP majority lining up with Democrats against most of their own caucus , including Majority Leader Eric Cantor and party whip Kevin McCarthy . Rep. Nan Hayworth , an outgoing Republican representative from New York , said she was a `` reluctant yes . ''
`` This is the best we can do , given the Senate and the White House sentiment at this point in time , and it is at least a partial victory for the American people , '' Hayworth said . `` I 'll take that at this point . ''
The Senate plan was brokered by Vice President Joe Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Kentucky , and it passed that Democratic-led chamber 89-8 . But many House Republicans complained the bill did too little to cut spending while raising taxes for them to support it .
Conservative lobbyist Grover Norquist , whose Americans for Tax Reform pushes candidates to sign a pledge never to raise taxes , said the plan preserves most of the Bush tax cuts and wo n't violate his group 's beliefs .
`` The Bush tax cuts lapsed at midnight last night , '' Norquist tweeted Tuesday . `` Every ( Republican ) voting for Senate bill is cutting taxes and keeping his/her pledge . ''
But Rep. Jeff Landry , R-Louisiana , told CNN 's `` Early Start '' that Obama convinced Boehner `` to undo everything he promised he would do '' after the 2010 elections that gave the GOP control of the House .
`` They did a debt ceiling deal , gave the president $ 2.1 trillion , '' Landry said . `` They turned that deal off for two months . That 's going to be another fight on top of the sequestration , a debt ceiling fight . ''
Other Republicans warned that as they did in 2011 , they 'll be demanding additional cuts before they agree to raise the federal cap on borrowing .
`` The president has maxed out his credit card , and he is not going to get an unlimited credit card , '' Sen. John Barrasso , R-Wyoming , told CNN . `` We 're going to talk specifically about cuts and specifically focused on tax reform as well as helping to save and strengthen Medicare and Social Security . And that 's the next discussion we 're going to have in Washington . ''
The federal government bumped up against its $ 16.4 trillion debt ceiling on Monday and has about two months before it runs out of ways to shuffle money around to keep Washington within its legal borrowing limit . Obama had sought to resolve the issue as part of the fiscal cliff negotiations , but the issue never made it to a final bill .
Tuesday night , the president warned Congress that he will not tolerate another round of brinksmanship that could have `` catastrophic '' effects on the global economy .
`` While I will negotiate over many things , I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they 've already racked up through the laws that they 've passed , '' he said .
The last debt-ceiling battle led to the sequester , a kind of fiscal doomsday device that Congress was supposed to disarm by agreeing to more than $ 1 trillion in other cuts over the next decade . They did n't , leaving federal agencies preparing to slash spending by $ 110 billion by the end of the 2013 budget year .
Before Tuesday night , the Defense Department had been preparing to issue furlough notices for its entire civilian work force of 800,000 . Those notices were stayed on Wednesday -- but Pentagon officials say they 're worried that unpaid leave may be harder to implement later in the fiscal year .
`` We hope Congress can find a way to end sequester once and for all , '' Pentagon spokesman George Little said .

Obama calls for ""a little less brinksmanship"" next time

Tuesday night's vote prevents tax increases for more than 98% of Americans

It also staves off $110 billion in automatic cuts to domestic and military spending

President Barack Obama has signed into law a bill to avert the fiscal cliff, a day after the House and Senate approved the much-debated legislation.

Obama, who returned to his family vacation in Hawaii after Tuesday's House vote, signed the bill via autopen on Wednesday.

But new battles over taxes and spending await Washington in the next few weeks.

Congress averted that self-built precipice late Tuesday when the House voted to stave off widespread tax increases and deep spending cuts by accepting a brokered Senate compromise. It makes permanent the Bush administration's tax cuts for individuals earning less than $400,000 per year and couples earning less than $450,000.

It raises rates on those who make more than that from 35% to 39.6%, bringing back a top tax bracket from the Clinton administration, and will raise roughly $600 billion in new revenues over 10 years, according to various estimates.

The bill also extends unemployment insurance and delays for two months the threat of sequestration -- a series of automatic, across-the-board cuts in federal spending.

Economists had predicted the combination of those tax increases and spending cuts could have thrown the U.S. economy back into recession and driven unemployment back into the 9% range.

to raise the federal debt ceiling and what to do about the still-hanging sequester -- a legacy of the last battle over the debt ceiling, in 2011. Meanwhile, a new Congress takes office on Thursday, and lawmakers will soon be confronted by the needto raise the federal debt ceiling and what to do about the still-hanging sequester -- a legacy of the last battle over the debt ceiling, in 2011.

""The sum total of all the budget agreements we've reached so far proves that there is a path forward that is possible, if we focus not on our politics but on what's right for the country,"" Obama told reporters late Tuesday, after the House approved the fiscal cliff deal. ""And the one thing that I think, hopefully, in the new year, we'll focus on is seeing if we can put a package like this together with a little bit less drama, a little less brinksmanship, not scare the heck out of folks quite as much.""

Tuesday night's 257-167 vote saw Boehner, R-Ohio, and about a third of the GOP majority lining up with Democrats against most of their own caucus, including Majority Leader Eric Cantor and party whip Kevin McCarthy. Rep. Nan Hayworth, an outgoing Republican representative from New York, said she was a ""reluctant yes.""

""This is the best we can do, given the Senate and the White House sentiment at this point in time, and it is at least a partial victory for the American people,"" Hayworth said. ""I'll take that at this point.""

The Senate plan was brokered by Vice President Joe Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, and it passed that Democratic-led chamber 89-8. But many House Republicans complained the bill did too little to cut spending while raising taxes for them to support it.

Conservative lobbyist Grover Norquist, whose Americans for Tax Reform pushes candidates to sign a pledge never to raise taxes, said the plan preserves most of the Bush tax cuts and won't violate his group's beliefs.

""The Bush tax cuts lapsed at midnight last night,"" Norquist tweeted Tuesday. ""Every (Republican) voting for Senate bill is cutting taxes and keeping his/her pledge.""

But Rep. Jeff Landry, R-Louisiana, told CNN's ""Early Start"" that Obama convinced Boehner ""to undo everything he promised he would do"" after the 2010 elections that gave the GOP control of the House.

""They did a debt ceiling deal, gave the president $2.1 trillion,"" Landry said. ""They turned that deal off for two months. That's going to be another fight on top of the sequestration, a debt ceiling fight.""

Other Republicans warned that as they did in 2011, they'll be demanding additional cuts before they agree to raise the federal cap on borrowing.

""The president has maxed out his credit card, and he is not going to get an unlimited credit card,"" Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyoming, told CNN. ""We're going to talk specifically about cuts and specifically focused on tax reform as well as helping to save and strengthen Medicare and Social Security. And that's the next discussion we're going to have in Washington.""

The federal government bumped up against its $16.4 trillion debt ceiling on Monday and has about two months before it runs out of ways to shuffle money around to keep Washington within its legal borrowing limit. Obama had sought to resolve the issue as part of the fiscal cliff negotiations, but the issue never made it to a final bill.

Tuesday night, the president warned Congress that he will not tolerate another round of brinksmanship that could have ""catastrophic"" effects on the global economy.

""While I will negotiate over many things, I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they've already racked up through the laws that they've passed,"" he said.

The last debt-ceiling battle led to the sequester, a kind of fiscal doomsday device that Congress was supposed to disarm by agreeing to more than $1 trillion in other cuts over the next decade. They didn't, leaving federal agencies preparing to slash spending by $110 billion by the end of the 2013 budget year.

Before Tuesday night, the Defense Department had been preparing to issue furlough notices for its entire civilian work force of 800,000. Those notices were stayed on Wednesday -- but Pentagon officials say they're worried that unpaid leave may be harder to implement later in the fiscal year.

""We hope Congress can find a way to end sequester once and for all,"" Pentagon spokesman George Little said.

While the deal gives Obama bragging rights for raising income taxes on the wealthiest Americans -- the first rate increase for any Americans since 1993 -- it also leaves him breaking a promise.

Obama had vowed to raise tax rates for the top-earning 2% of Americans, including those with household income above $250,000 and individuals earning more than $200,000.

Raising the threshold for higher tax rates shrinks the number of Americans affected. While nearly 2% of filers have adjusted gross incomes over $250,000, only 0.6% have incomes above $500,000, according to the Tax Policy Center.

By comparison, Census Bureau figures put the median U.S. household income at just over $50,000.

And despite the last-minute fiscal cliff agreements, Americans are still likely to see their paychecks shrink somewhat because of a separate battle over payroll taxes.

The government temporarily lowered the payroll tax rate in 2011 from 6.2% to 4.2% to put more money in the pockets of Americans. That adjustment, which has cost about $120 billion each year, expired Monday.

Now, Americans earning $30,000 a year will take home $50 less per month. Those earning $113,700 will lose $189.50 a month.

The legislation also caps itemized deductions for individuals making $250,000 and for married couples making $300,000. Taxes on inherited estates over $5 million will go up to 40% from 35%, and that threshold will be indexed for inflation.

If all the recent wrangling over the fiscal cliff has revealed anything , it 's how tense and strained President Obama 's relationship is with Republicans in Congress .
And Obama 's relationship with Congress reached yet another low Thursday when House Speaker John Boehner confirmed to CNN that he has told House Republicans he will no longer negotiate legislative deals with the president .
Thursday , Sen. John Cornyn of Texas faulted the president for all the fiscal brinksmanship since 2010 .

CNN contributor Ruben Navarrette Jr. said Obama 's strained relationship with congressional Republicans dates back to the contentious debate over Obama 's signature health care legislation , where the president showed his willingness to push through major proposals and major legislation without consulting them .
`` He is so good at the business of politics that he 's really outmaneuvered them , '' Navarrette observed about Obama 's relationship with Republicans over the past four years .

And buoyed by his electoral success in 2008 , legislative successes in the first half of his first term and by winning a second term , Obama adopted a take-it-or-leave-it attitude with Republicans , even as the nation teetered on the edge of the fiscal cliff .
`` My preference would have been to solve these problems in the context of a larger agreement , a bigger deal , a grand bargain . But with this Congress , that was obviously a little too much to hope for at this time , '' Obama said Monday afternoon at a White House event that at moments seemed like a campaign gathering .

At the same event , Obama also warned the GOP about expected battles over spending cuts in the coming months .
`` Now , if Republicans think that I will finish the job of deficit reduction through spending cuts alone , '' Obama said , `` [ I ] f they think that 's going to be the formula for how we solve this thing , then they 've got another thing coming . That 's not how it 's going to work . '' Rather , Obama declared `` it 's going to have to be a matter of shared sacrifice , at least as long as I 'm president . And I 'm going to be president for the next four years . ''
Obama 's recent post-election trash talking directed at Congress is `` defiance politics '' that misunderstands what it means to win an election , Navarrette said .
The president 's recent comments are like `` an end zone dance , a celebration '' or , in the world of mixed martial arts competition , like `` putting your foot on the other guy 's neck and holding your hand up in the air , '' after you 've felled your opponent , according to Navarrette .
Instead of taking every opportunity to remind Republicans that he won ( and they lost ) last November , Obama needs to realize that `` with winning elections comes the responsibility to lead , '' Navarrette said . As the person in whom the public has placed its trust and confidence , `` your burdens are much greater ( than your losing opponent 's ) . ''
Democrats counter that Obama has n't had anyone to make a deal with .
`` When John Boehner comes to the table and he ca n't even bring his deputy or his third in command to vote for the deal that he is agreeing to , I think you 've got a real crisis of leadership in the House , '' former White House press secretary Bill Burton said .
`` And so the president showed that even in that case , he can get a deal that moves the ball forward for the country , but going forward , you just wonder , how much control does Boehner have over the folks in the House and what kind of deals are we going to be able to get ? ''
For all his recent public swagger when it comes to Congress , Obama `` really does compromise a lot , '' said Zelizer . For example , Zelizer pointed out that during recent negotiations over the fiscal cliff , the president changed his position substantially on the income threshold for eliminating the Bush tax cuts .
While he says he does n't think there 's much more Obama can do publicly to smooth over the differences with House Republicans , Zelizer said that Obama ca n't let stand Boehner 's declaration that he 's abandoning any more legislative deal-making with the White House . The president would be wise to try to work behind the scenes to keep Boehner `` in the fold and maintain some sort of relationship '' with the speaker .
And Zelizer noted an encouraging pattern in the recent fiscal brinksmanship between Congress and the president .
After negotiations between Boehner and Obama broke down , `` ( Senate Minority Leader Mitch ) McConnell stepped up and put the deal together , '' observed Zelizer , who added the Senate could take the lead again in working out agreements on things like handling automatic spending cuts put off by this week 's fiscal cliff deal and likely upcoming battles over the debt ceiling and funding the federal government .
Zelizer noted that after McConnell negotiated a deal with Vice President Joe Biden , Boehner allowed House Republicans to entertain an alternative that would have included more spending cuts , an alternative which never made it to a vote because fiscal conservatives could n't muster a majority in the House GOP to support its passage .
Ultimately , Boehner kept his pledge to Democratic leaders in Congress to put the Senate 's deal up for a House vote . By making the pledge before the terms of the Senate deal were even set , Zelizer said , Boehner sent a signal to House Republicans that they were going to lose the battle over the fiscal cliff even if they did n't like the Senate deal .
The maneuvers by McConnell and Boehner suggest a path forward if repeated , according to Zelizer , because if GOP leaders continue not to obstruct Democrats as they try to move forward with legislation , that could help bring around tea party Republicans in the House .
In order to improve their relationship with the White House , Navarette said Republicans `` have to fix what 's broken in their own party , they have to heal the divisions in their own party . . . and define what the GOP is about . ''
Calling it `` a miracle '' that Boehner was re-elected as speaker , Navarette said the GOP must also decide which role it wants to play in Obama 's second term . Will they try to be accommodating and try to work with the president to find solutions to problems , including some problems Republican donors and the Republican establishment wants fixed ? Or will they play the proverbial loyal opposition ?
Both are `` not terribly attractive options '' for the GOP , Navarette said , especially up against a masterful political strategist like Obama .
And Navarrette suggests that the sports-loving and competitive Obama invite top Republicans over to the White House for his annual Super Bowl watching party in order to build personal relationships across the aisle in Congress .
For Obama , moderating his triumphal , defiant approach when it comes to Republicans and Congress is also important because , Navarette points out , gun control and immigration reform are both high on Obama 's second term agenda . And there are strong feelings on the part of conservatives and Obama 's liberal base on both issues .
On the fiscal issues where Obama has repeatedly clashed with Capitol Hill Republicans in the past two years , Zelizer warns that recent events could repeat themselves .
`` It 's going to be rough , going to be tough , we 're going to see this issue recur again and again over the years , '' the historian said .
Indeed , both Obama and McConnell , the GOP 's new lead fiscal negotiator , already seem to be playing out a familiar script .
The last fiscal battle barely over , Obama wasted no time late Tuesday night staking out his position in the battles to come
After saying `` I am very open to compromise , '' the president went on to fire a shot over Congress ' bow in the likely fight in February over raising the debt ceiling . `` [ W ] hile I will negotiate over many things , I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they 've already racked up through the laws that they passed , '' Obama declared , `` Let me repeat : We ca n't not pay bills that we 've already incurred . ''
`` The president may not want to have a fight about government spending over the next few months , but it 's the fight he is going to have , because it 's a debate the country needs , '' McConnell wrote in a Yahoo op-ed published Wednesday night , adding that Obama `` must show up '' and deliver a serious plan for slashing federal spending .

It 's the first of many meetings aimed at avoiding automatic tax increases and spending cuts at the beginning of the new year .
A week ago , the president proved again that he and his team are good at winning elections . The question now is whether he can translate victory at the ballot box to success in shaping policy .
The 62 million Americans who voted to re-elect the president last week had no illusions about what they were doing . One could argue that four years ago , Obama was something of a blank slate , on which voters could project whatever they wanted . But if 2008 was the soft-focus honeymoon , 2012 is the hard-won anniversary — in which the bonds between the president and his supporters have been tested and survived .
Part of what voters know now is that Obama wants to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans . He made no secret of that during stalled budget talks with congressional Republicans last year or during the long months of the presidential campaign .
`` It was debated over and over again . And on Tuesday night , we found out that the majority of Americans agree with my approach , '' Obama said . `` And that includes Democrats , independents and a lot of Republicans across the country . ''
Indeed , exit polls found 60 percent of voters believe income taxes should go up — either for the wealthiest Americans or for everyone . That includes 40 percent of the people who voted for Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney .
Former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel says lawmakers have to pay attention to numbers like that . At the president 's victory celebration in Chicago last week , Emanuel , now the city 's mayor , said it could set the stage for the kind of compromise President Clinton achieved with a Republican Congress when he was re-elected in 1996 .

President Obama meets with labor leaders at the White House on Tuesday to discuss how to steer clear of the so-called fiscal cliff. It's the first of many meetings aimed at avoiding automatic tax increases and spending cuts at the beginning of the new year.

A week ago, the president proved again that he and his team are good at winning elections. The question now is whether he can translate victory at the ballot box to success in shaping policy.

The 62 million Americans who voted to re-elect the president last week had no illusions about what they were doing. One could argue that four years ago, Obama was something of a blank slate, on which voters could project whatever they wanted. But if 2008 was the soft-focus honeymoon, 2012 is the hard-won anniversary — in which the bonds between the president and his supporters have been tested and survived.

Part of what voters know now is that Obama wants to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans. He made no secret of that during stalled budget talks with congressional Republicans last year or during the long months of the presidential campaign.

""It was debated over and over again. And on Tuesday night, we found out that the majority of Americans agree with my approach,"" Obama said. ""And that includes Democrats, independents and a lot of Republicans across the country.""

Indeed, exit polls found 60 percent of voters believe income taxes should go up — either for the wealthiest Americans or for everyone. That includes 40 percent of the people who voted for Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney.

Former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel says lawmakers have to pay attention to numbers like that. At the president's victory celebration in Chicago last week, Emanuel, now the city's mayor, said it could set the stage for the kind of compromise President Clinton achieved with a Republican Congress when he was re-elected in 1996.

""We had a big battle in '95 and '96. President Clinton won. Nine months later, there was a balanced budget agreement,"" said Emanuel, a former Democratic congressman. ""Because when you get an election, elections have meaning, they have value. And anybody in Washington who ignores the voters plays peril with those types of politics.""

Since the election, Republican House Speaker John Boehner has shown some willingness to collect more tax revenue from the wealthy, so long as it can be done without raising tax rates. Obama says he's encouraged by Boehner's newfound flexibility, but he's not just waiting passively for congressional Republicans to come around to where a majority of voters are.

""The most important lesson I've learned is that you can't change Washington from the inside,"" Obama said during an interview with Univision in late September. ""You can only change it from the outside.""

The president noted that public pressure from outside Washington can be an important tool in moving a reluctant Congress. Obama mobilized such pressure only sporadically during his first term — to pass a payroll tax cut, for example — but he suggested he might turn to the public more often in the future.

""Something that I'd really like to concentrate on in my second term is being in a much more constant conversation with the American people, so that they can put pressure on Congress to help move some of these issues forward,"" he said.

That's easier said than done, as Obama discovered in his first term, when he quickly gave up on his pledge to hold health care talks on national television. It's one thing to command voters' attention during the final weeks of a close presidential campaign and quite another to keep them focused during a months-long debate over tax policy.

Still, Obama says he's determined to try harder this time. He told voters in Ohio shortly before Election Day that their responsibilities don't stop at the ballot box.

""Even after that, I'm going to need all of you involved to make sure that we don't let up,"" he said. ""Because one of the things I think we've all learned over these last four years is our democracy only works when the American people are involved and engaged.""

Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and White House Director of Legislative Affairs Rob Nabors presented the details while making the rounds on Capitol Hill Thursday.

The headlines? The White House is asking for $1.6 trillion dollars in new taxes. This would include the president's campaign pledge to raise tax rates on families who make $250,000 a year and more. It would bring in additional money by closing loopholes, limiting deductions, raising the estate tax rate to 2009 levels and increasing capital gains and dividends taxes.

Republican sources tell CNN the $1.6 trillion figure is higher than any number the White House had previously presented and was so disarming, according to one source, it set the talks back.

Democrats say the GOP is feigning outrage. In September 2011, Obama first proposed raising taxes one and a half trillion dollars - at that time to pay for the so-called Jobs Bill. Republicans dismissed it as a political stunt with no chance of movement.

It would seem the White House is digging in on its position on taxes - or at least making their stance clearer to the Republicans and the public.

It includes a permanent mechanism to vote on a debt limit increase, which would avoid the kind of crisis the U.S. faced in the summer of 2011.

While Republicans called these proposals unbalanced and unreasonable, White House aides made clear the president is ready to take a counter offer.

This all amounts to an elaborate negotiating dance. With time running out until tax rates automatically rise and drastic spending cuts kick in - part of the so-called sequester - both sides are playing for leverage against the clock.

Democrats are emboldened by electoral successes and that the president won a second term while pledging to do what the Republicans are still objecting to: raise tax rates for the wealthiest. Democrats believe the Republicans must and will relent on that point.

To that end, CNN learned in a phone call Wednesday night Obama told Boehner there would be no deal unless the GOP agrees to raise tax rates for the wealthiest. That means recently floated alternatives – including closing loopholes or limiting deductions - would not be enough on their own. Rates must go up as well for the top 2% of income earners.

President Barack Obama called closed-door negotiations a “mistake” after backroom wheeling and dealing almost sunk his health care bill.

But the fiscal cliff talks are playing out much the same way.

Story Continued Below

The negotiations on the Hill have taken place in private. Obama has held closed-door sessions with CEOs, union leaders, liberal activists and small business owners. When congressional leaders were invited to the White House, cameras were allowed in for a brief statement — then ushered out. And GOP aides, not White House officials, leaked details of the administration’s opening offer on the fiscal cliff to reporters.

Of course, it’s extremely difficult to reach compromise on major legislation in Washington with cameras present — and pretty tough even when they’re not. Obama has learned that the hard way during his first term. But his 2008 pledge to open up the process — a commitment he repeated in 2010 — has provided a perennial attack line against him whenever there’s a prickly issue that needs to be resolved.

Some on the right, chiefly Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) and Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform, have embarked on a campaign to open the negotiations to the public. A few on the left agree. The desire for transparency seems to come largely from those at either end of the political spectrum who fear their allies will abandon them behind closed doors. And good-government groups believe closed-door talks almost always lead to special favors and deals that shortchange the public.

“The negotiations are dead until you get the cameras in there,” Norquist told POLITICO. “The only way to stop posturing is to have the cameras there.” He said Obama ran for president “saying he would have the cameras there” on health care, and “this is his opportunity to make up for that.”

Sessions charged Monday on Fox News that “These secret talks violate the principle of American government that [it] would be open. Every city, county, school board has open meeting laws.”

Many Washington veterans dismiss talk of open budget negotiations as fantasy. Some degree of secrecy is essential, they say, especially with interest groups watching for the slightest wavering from their agendas.

“You’re talking to a former journalist [who believes in] freedom of the press, transparency and open meetings, but you cannot have talks like this go public,” said Tom Korologos, a longtime D.C. lobbyist who worked as a former Senate liaison for Presidents Nixon and Ford. “It thwarts and hampers the leaders in the meeting from expressing their opinions. They can’t just say, ‘That’s bull****, Mr. Secretary, you know that,’ and he can’t say, ‘God damn it, the president wants it.’… For these closed-door meetings — and I’ve been in hundreds of them in the Executive Branch and on the Hill — you get a lot more done behind closed doors than you certainly do with open doors.”

Korologos said public talks would lead to showboating that could jeopardize the chances of resolving the issue before tax rates jump up on Jan. 1.

“If all of them need to take place in the open, we’ll be here ’til the Fourth of July,” he said.

But on Thursday, Republicans struck a different note.

Mr. McConnell accused the Obama administration of being more interested in appealing to the “hard left” than having a “serious discussion about how we fix the economy, reduce the federal debt and return the country to a path of growth and prosperity for all.”

Mr. Boehner said he is “disappointed” with the negotiations and warned that “there’s a real danger of going off the fiscal cliff.”

The two parties also have staked out different positions on how best to increase the nation’s $16.4 trillion debt limit, which the federal government could reach as early as next month. Mr. Reid said that any agreement in the “fiscal cliff” talks must include an increase in the borrowing limit, while Mr. Boehner said any increase has to be matched dollar for dollar with spending cuts.

“They’re not going to openly concede on this point this far out from the deadline, but they see the handwriting on the wall,” the New York Democrat said.

Other Republicans said the majority of the caucus does not agree with Mr. Cole’s approach.

“I think he is wrong, and I think most of the conference thinks he is wrong,” Rep. Raul R. Labrador, Idaho Republican, told CNN. “I think that he is a good man who has served here for a long time, but he is also a man who has voted for a lot of the increased spending in Washington, D.C.”

And now they 've waited too long to avert it , even if they do somehow eke out a deal by Dec. 31 .
Dragging out the negotiations this far has created needless uncertainty and pushed some individuals and businesses to try to protect themselves against something the government may or may not do .
Lawmakers ' delay in averting the cliff -- which is likely to be averted eventually -- has also made it hard to plan and has set the stage for needless administrative messes next year .
`` This really is malfeasance , '' said Joseph Minarik , director of research at the Committee for Economic Development .
Refunds could be delayed for months : The IRS warned lawmakers this week that if they do n't act to protect the middle class from having to pay the Alternative Minimum Tax by Dec. 31 , up to 100 million taxpayers may not be able to file their 2012 taxes until late March .
That would mean their refunds will be delayed . And they would n't be injecting those refunds into the economy during the first quarter .
Based on Treasury Department records from the past three years , refunds paid during January , February and March combined have ranged from $ 117 billion to $ 136 billion .
Payroll processors left in the dark : Those who cut paychecks for a living are genuinely perplexed about how much money to withhold in income taxes from workers ' wages starting in January . If they do n't receive any guidance from Washington , they 'll stick with 2012 withholding tables , they say .

And now they've waited too long to avert it, even if they do somehow eke out a deal by Dec. 31.

Dragging out the negotiations this far has created needless uncertainty and pushed some individuals and businesses to try to protect themselves against something the government may or may not do.

Lawmakers' delay in averting the cliff -- which is likely to be averted eventually -- has also made it hard to plan and has set the stage for needless administrative messes next year.

""This really is malfeasance,"" said Joseph Minarik, director of research at the Committee for Economic Development.

Refunds could be delayed for months: The IRS warned lawmakers this week that if they don't act to protect the middle class from having to pay the Alternative Minimum Tax by Dec. 31, up to 100 million taxpayers may not be able to file their 2012 taxes until late March.

That would mean their refunds will be delayed. And they wouldn't be injecting those refunds into the economy during the first quarter.

Based on Treasury Department records from the past three years, refunds paid during January, February and March combined have ranged from $117 billion to $136 billion.

Fiscal cliff indecision leaves paychecks up in the air

Payroll processors left in the dark: Those who cut paychecks for a living are genuinely perplexed about how much money to withhold in income taxes from workers' wages starting in January. If they don't receive any guidance from Washington, they'll stick with 2012 withholding tables, they say.

They're just hoping that if lawmakers can't reach a deal until next year, that any income tax changes they approve not be made retroactive to Jan. 1. If they are retroactive, then payroll systems will have to be altered to make corrections for 2013 paychecks already issued.

Gift giving grows: If Congress does nothing, the gift and estate tax will soar next year. But most in Congress support a more lenient version of the tax -- they just don't agree on how lenient.

Nevertheless, estate lawyers tell CNNMoney that they've seen a huge transfer in wealth this year by folks hoping to beat a potentially higher gift and estate tax.

Doctors' facing pay cut: Medicare doctors have been put on notice: The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will have to process payment claims according to current law, which means a 27% cut in pay starting in January.

Never mind that most in Congress want to avert the scheduled cut. They have done so regularly in the past.

Once physicians submit a claim, it takes at least two weeks before the claim is paid. So if Congress passes a so-called ""doc fix"" quickly next year, that could potentially prevent pay cuts from occurring.

Or not. It's impossible to say.

Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner took to the Sunday talk shows to push the Obama administration's plan to avert the ""fiscal cliff,"" saying that while he was optimistic about a deal with Republicans, there would be no agreement without an increase in tax rates for the top 2 percent of income earners.

""There's not going to be an agreement without rates going up,"" Geithner said on CNN's State of the Union. ""If Republicans are not willing to let rates go back up [to Clinton-era levels] ... then there will not be an agreement.""

Geithner presented congressional leaders last week with the administration's plan to avert the ""fiscal cliff,"" a combination of major tax increases and drastic spending cuts scheduled for the end of the year.

Here's more about the plan from The Associated Press:

""As outlined by administration officials, the plan calls for nearly $1.6 trillion in new tax revenue over the next decade, while making $600 billion in spending cuts, including $350 billion from Medicare and other health programs. But it also contains $200 billion in new spending on jobless benefits, public works and aid for struggling homeowners — and would make it virtually impossible for Congress to block Obama's ability to raise the debt ceiling.""

Speaking on Fox News Sunday, House Speaker John Boehner dismissed the offer as ""a non-serious proposal.""

Boehner said he was ""just flabbergasted"" when presented with the plan.

""I looked at [Geithner] and I said, 'You can't be serious,'"" he said.

Boehner also dismissed the administration's demand that Congress give up its ability to vote on the debt ceiling.

""Congress is not going to give up this power,"" he said. ""I've made it clear to the president, that every time we get to the debt limit, we need to cut some reforms that are greater than the increase in the debt limit.

His new toughness is rooted in the nature of his convincing November win over Mitt Romney. Obama was carried to the finish line by supporters after his epic flop at the Denver debate.

After his 2008 win, he talked a lot about bipartisanship. This time he’s determined to squeeze it out of Republicans. He believes he owes that to the people who voted for him.

“There’s no doubt that he found this one to be sweeter than the last one,” said one of Obama’s top aides. “It was weighing on him how much was at stake, how much of his entire legacy was on the line. His legacy had not been determined by the previous four years; that wouldn’t matter to history. It was all about the outcome on Election Day.”

With that outcome now in the history books, the people around the president now see him as a Democratic Reagan, a resilient and popular figure who can unify the country — if only the dead-enders will give him a chance.

When the book’s authors asked David Plouffe, Obama’s most influential political adviser, whether the campaign’s organizational success could be replicated with other Democrats, he sprang forward in his chair. “The organization doesn’t exist without belief in the candidate … they turned out for Barack Obama,” he said. “It was all because of him.”

But the buzz from Election Day has proven to be remarkably brief. The White House has been thrust from its post-victory reverie into a Groundhog Day partisan battle that makes any talk of a new “mandate” seem laughable.

One mother of an autistic son is worried that cuts would hurt his care

State agencies are often supported through federal dollars, which could be slashed

For many families, the nation's lurch toward the so-called fiscal cliff evokes either mind-numbing confusion, measured optimism or downright fear.

But for Lisa Slifer, a single mother of three, the consequences of failing to come to a deal are all too real.

Slifer's son, Kara, 11, is autistic. He and his mother depend heavily on state, local and private programs that receive grants from Washington. Many of those funds could be cut back if Congress and the White House can't avoid the automatic and drastic spending cuts that kick in less than three weeks from now.

Sure , the endlessly-discussed `` fiscal cliff '' has been averted thanks to a flawed , 13th-hour deal -- but the high-stakes partisan wrangling is just beginning . We 'll get to the road ahead in a moment , but first , a word or two about the compromise itself . Let 's stipulate right out of the gate that it stinks . It was jammed through in late night votes at the last possible minute , it scratches the Left 's `` fairness '' itch to no constructive end , and the CBO calcluates its tax hike to spending cut ratio is roughly 41 to 1 . * Pathetic . Nevertheless , Phil Klein captures things pretty well with his appraisal of the deal as `` objectively bad , but relatively good . '' He runs through the handful of reasons why it is n't an unvarnished disaster :
At the start of 2013 , income taxes were scheduled to go up on nearly every American , but if this deal becomes law , roughly 99 percent of taxpayers would be protected from those tax hikes . For over a decade , Democrats opposed the Bush tax cuts and prevented them from becoming permanent . Now , they have voted overwhelmingly to preserve about 84 percent of the dreaded cuts , which for years they demagogued as only benefitting the very rich . Lawmakers also agreed on permanent changes that minimized the tax increases on estates and capital gains . In addition , the deal permanently prevented the Alternative Minimum Tax ( originally passed in 1969 to capture a small number of rich households who were avoiding taxes ) from hitting tens and millions of Americans . From a more technical standpoint , this also means that the deal locks in a Congressional Budget Office revenue baseline that will be as low as possible . So , if future Republicans propose real tax reform , we won ’ t end up with estimates saying that their proposals would cost trillions of dollars , because such proposals will no longer be judged against an unrealistic baseline that assumes all of the Bush tax cuts would otherwise expire and open the floodgates to new revenue . A less publicized but still significant positive from the deal is that it formally repeals the CLASS Act , a long-term care entitlement that is part of Obama ’ s national health care law . There ’ s a lot to hate in this deal , no doubt . But any honest assessment of it must grapple with the reality of Obama as president , Harry Reid as Senate Majority Leader and $ 4.5 trillion in automatic tax hikes hitting in the new year . With this in mind , I ’ d rate the deal as objectively bad , but relatively good .
I 'd again emphasize that the Bush tax rates on 99 percent of Americans are now permanent . House Republican leadership fractured on the question of final passage , with Paul Ryan , Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Boehner himself voting aye ( Speakers rarely cast votes ) , and Eric Cantor and Kevin McCarthy voting no . The GOP 's rank and file opposed the bill by nearly a 2-to-1 margin , with a handful of Democrats joining the `` no '' crowd . Thus , most tallies in favor of sending the bill to the president 's desk came from Democrats ; Boehner shelved the House 's `` majority of the majority '' rule of thumb to allow an up-or-down verdict on the bill . Will this fuel an internecine revolt against him , or are most members willing to forgive their cornered leader 's power play -- particularly after the pre-Christmas `` plan B '' fiasco ? We 'll know soon enough . The new Congress is sworn in today , and the Speaker election is expected around noon . Rumors of Boehner 's demise may have been premature . We 'll see . Meanwhile , the president has returned to Hawaii to resume his vacation ... at an additional cost of $ 3 million to John Q . Taxpayer .
Which brings us to what lies ahead . Obama delivered a useless , petulant , counter-productive speech on New Year 's Eve , which incensed House Republicans and threatened to derail the ongoing McConnell/Biden negotiations . ( Sidebar : It 's noteworthy that once Harry Reid left the room , a deal finally got done ) . Obama 's remarks were n't merely about gloating , base-pandering , and demagoguery -- which are all staples of the president 's rhetorical repertoire , of course . No , they seemed primarily designed to lay the groundwork for the next round of cliff-esque drama , due in February or March . For all his gloating about Republicans being forced to permit Democrats to enact some tax rate increases , he quickly cautioned that forthcoming deliberations over debt reduction would also require `` revenue '' increases on `` the rich '' and `` large corporations . '' This was Obama 's unsubtle way of warning Republicans that he 'll be demanding even more tax increases this winter when the debt ceiling debate sets this city aflame . Also keep in mind that the new cliff compromise kicks the controversial sequestration cuts down the road for two more months . The automatic sweeping cuts that were to be the legally-mandated consequence of a `` Super Committee '' failure to settle on a spending cut package have been postponed . That failure is at hand , but the cuts are not . Surprise . So the central spending reduction gimmick from the last debt ceiling deal has thus far resulted in zero cuts , and has been shoved off yet again ... as another debt ceiling brawl is looming because we 've already blown through those additional trillions .
This , I think , provides a real opening for Republicans to finally regain their political footing . Obama and his Congressional allies exploited the GOP 's unpopularity and internal chaos to force tax rate increases on `` the rich . '' Indeed , Washington just birthed a dreadful bill that postpones the only real spending cuts on the table and jacks up taxes . It 's a fairnesspalooza . But it will accomplish nothing . We 'll still have a massive deficit , our debt will continue to swell , and the $ 600 Billion in anticipated revenues over ten years are already slated to head right out the door in the form of new spending . When we hit our debt ceiling this winter ( we 've technically already done so ) , the American people will be treated to yet another political spectacle , replete with the now-familiar warnings about our nation 's credit rating , hysterical threats about a government shutdown , and a ticking clock . This is what the `` Doc Fix Economy '' hath wrought : Rather than engaging in standard budgeting -- as Congress is required to do -- Democrats have ushered in a new era of budget-free governance , resulting in a maddening parade of recurring , man-made `` emergencies . '' It 's throughly dysfunctional , and the cycle must be broken . If and when Obama resurrects his class warfare/more taxes schtick in a few months , Republicans can occupy the high ground by pointing to the fiscal cliff and advancing actual solutions :

UPDATE III - Ramesh Ponnuru explains why 41-to-1 is a misleading statsitic . That notwithstanding , the deal punts the sequester cuts by two months , and there are no new cuts .","Enjoy the communal sigh of relief while it lasts, America. Sure, the endlessly-discussed ""fiscal cliff"" has been averted thanks to a flawed, 13th-hour deal -- but the high-stakes partisan wrangling is just beginning. We'll get to the road ahead in a moment, but first, a word or two about the compromise itself. Let's stipulate right out of the gate that it stinks. It was jammed through in late night votes at the last possible minute, it scratches the Left's ""fairness"" itch to no constructive end, and the CBO calcluates its tax hike to spending cut ratio is roughly 41 to 1.* Pathetic. Nevertheless, Phil Klein captures things pretty well with his appraisal of the deal as ""objectively bad, but relatively good."" He runs through the handful of reasons why it isn't an unvarnished disaster:



At the start of 2013, income taxes were scheduled to go up on nearly every American, but if this deal becomes law, roughly 99 percent of taxpayers would be protected from those tax hikes. For over a decade, Democrats opposed the Bush tax cuts and prevented them from becoming permanent. Now, they have voted overwhelmingly to preserve about 84 percent of the dreaded cuts, which for years they demagogued as only benefitting the very rich. Lawmakers also agreed on permanent changes that minimized the tax increases on estates and capital gains. In addition, the deal permanently prevented the Alternative Minimum Tax (originally passed in 1969 to capture a small number of rich households who were avoiding taxes) from hitting tens and millions of Americans. From a more technical standpoint, this also means that the deal locks in a Congressional Budget Office revenue baseline that will be as low as possible. So, if future Republicans propose real tax reform, we won’t end up with estimates saying that their proposals would cost trillions of dollars, because such proposals will no longer be judged against an unrealistic baseline that assumes all of the Bush tax cuts would otherwise expire and open the floodgates to new revenue. A less publicized but still significant positive from the deal is that it formally repeals the CLASS Act, a long-term care entitlement that is part of Obama’s national health care law. There’s a lot to hate in this deal, no doubt. But any honest assessment of it must grapple with the reality of Obama as president, Harry Reid as Senate Majority Leader and $4.5 trillion in automatic tax hikes hitting in the new year. With this in mind, I’d rate the deal as objectively bad, but relatively good.



I'd again emphasize that the Bush tax rates on 99 percent of Americans are now permanent. House Republican leadership fractured on the question of final passage, with Paul Ryan, Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Boehner himself voting aye (Speakers rarely cast votes), and Eric Cantor and Kevin McCarthy voting no. The GOP's rank and file opposed the bill by nearly a 2-to-1 margin, with a handful of Democrats joining the ""no"" crowd. Thus, most tallies in favor of sending the bill to the president's desk came from Democrats; Boehner shelved the House's ""majority of the majority"" rule of thumb to allow an up-or-down verdict on the bill. Will this fuel an internecine revolt against him, or are most members willing to forgive their cornered leader's power play -- particularly after the pre-Christmas ""plan B"" fiasco? We'll know soon enough. The new Congress is sworn in today, and the Speaker election is expected around noon. Rumors of Boehner's demise may have been premature. We'll see. Meanwhile, the president has returned to Hawaii to resume his vacation...at an additional cost of $3 million to John Q. Taxpayer.

Which brings us to what lies ahead. Obama delivered a useless, petulant, counter-productive speech on New Year's Eve, which incensed House Republicans and threatened to derail the ongoing McConnell/Biden negotiations. (Sidebar: It's noteworthy that once Harry Reid left the room, a deal finally got done). Obama's remarks weren't merely about gloating, base-pandering, and demagoguery -- which are all staples of the president's rhetorical repertoire, of course. No, they seemed primarily designed to lay the groundwork for the next round of cliff-esque drama, due in February or March. For all his gloating about Republicans being forced to permit Democrats to enact some tax rate increases, he quickly cautioned that forthcoming deliberations over debt reduction would also require ""revenue"" increases on ""the rich"" and ""large corporations."" This was Obama's unsubtle way of warning Republicans that he'll be demanding even more tax increases this winter when the debt ceiling debate sets this city aflame. Also keep in mind that the new cliff compromise kicks the controversial sequestration cuts down the road for two more months. The automatic sweeping cuts that were to be the legally-mandated consequence of a ""Super Committee"" failure to settle on a spending cut package have been postponed. That failure is at hand, but the cuts are not. Surprise. So the central spending reduction gimmick from the last debt ceiling deal has thus far resulted in zero cuts, and has been shoved off yet again...as another debt ceiling brawl is looming because we've already blown through those additional trillions.

This, I think, provides a real opening for Republicans to finally regain their political footing. Obama and his Congressional allies exploited the GOP's unpopularity and internal chaos to force tax rate increases on ""the rich."" Indeed, Washington just birthed a dreadful bill that postpones the only real spending cuts on the table and jacks up taxes. It's a fairnesspalooza. But it will accomplish nothing. We'll still have a massive deficit, our debt will continue to swell, and the $600 Billion in anticipated revenues over ten years are already slated to head right out the door in the form of new spending. When we hit our debt ceiling this winter (we've technically already done so), the American people will be treated to yet another political spectacle, replete with the now-familiar warnings about our nation's credit rating, hysterical threats about a government shutdown, and a ticking clock. This is what the ""Doc Fix Economy"" hath wrought: Rather than engaging in standard budgeting -- as Congress is required to do -- Democrats have ushered in a new era of budget-free governance, resulting in a maddening parade of recurring, man-made ""emergencies."" It's throughly dysfunctional, and the cycle must be broken. If and when Obama resurrects his class warfare/more taxes schtick in a few months, Republicans can occupy the high ground by pointing to the fiscal cliff and advancing actual solutions:



You've gotten your pet tax hikes, Mr. President. The last batch of meaningful spending cuts have been delayed. Our deficits remain out of hand. Our official debt is larger than our GDP, and our real debt is far, far worse. We must fundamentally change our tax code. We must reduce our spending. And we must reform the largest long-term drivers of our debt, something that even you have acknowledged. Tinkering at the margins with populist appeals about raising taxes on Daddy Warbucks won't cut it. Those taxes already went up, despite our vehement objections. You ""won."" But now it's time for real solutions...

'
With the House set to vote this afternoon on Republicans ' `` Plan B '' for avoiding the so-called fiscal cliff , the questions that have been asked every day for weeks are being asked yet again , with added urgency :
Are we headed over that `` cliff '' of automatic spending cuts , tax increases and expiring job benefits ? Or are President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio , closer to a deal than they 're letting on in public ?
On Morning Edition , NPR 's Mara Liasson said the answers may be yes , and yes .
`` Either we 're one step closer to the cliff or this is just part of the 'two steps forward , one step backward ' process that Congress and the White House have to go through , '' she told host David Greene . Both sides , she added , may just need to show they 're `` fighting as hard as they can before they make the ultimate compromise . '' So , Republicans have put forward their Plan B and the White House has threatened to veto it ( though the odds seem low that it would be passed by the Democratic-controlled Senate ) .
There 's even talk , Mara said , about going `` over the cliff a little bit '' — for a few days or so after Jan. 1 — before an ultimate compromise .

With the House set to vote this afternoon on Republicans' ""Plan B"" for avoiding the so-called fiscal cliff, the questions that have been asked every day for weeks are being asked yet again, with added urgency:

Are we headed over that ""cliff"" of automatic spending cuts, tax increases and expiring job benefits? Or are President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, closer to a deal than they're letting on in public?

On Morning Edition, NPR's Mara Liasson said the answers may be yes, and yes.

""Either we're one step closer to the cliff or this is just part of the 'two steps forward, one step backward' process that Congress and the White House have to go through,"" she told host David Greene. Both sides, she added, may just need to show they're ""fighting as hard as they can before they make the ultimate compromise."" So, Republicans have put forward their Plan B and the White House has threatened to veto it (though the odds seem low that it would be passed by the Democratic-controlled Senate).

There's even talk, Mara said, about going ""over the cliff a little bit"" — for a few days or so after Jan. 1 — before an ultimate compromise.

And what a compromise might look like is taking shape, she pointed out. Boehner has proposed increases in revenues (a.k.a. taxes) of about $1 trillion by allowing Bush-era tax cuts on income of more than $1 million a year to expire. Boehner's also proposed about $1 trillion in spending cuts.

Meanwhile, Mara noted, Obama has proposed revenue increases of about $1.3 trillion — by letting those Bush-era tax cuts expire on income of more than $400,000 a year — and spending cuts of about $930 billion.

But face-to-face negotiations between the players best able to avert a fiscal cliff that’s just 33 days away? Nowhere in sight.

This is the public relations phase of the latest fiscal showdown in Washington, where direct engagement is no longer viewed as the optimal route to reaching a deal. As Wall Street shudders and Congress once again risks looking feckless in the face of crisis, both sides are locked in a battle to win over key interest groups — and the public.

( Also on POLITICO: Cliff dive doesn’t appeal to White House)

It’s an outside-in strategy — the reverse of the inside-out strategy that collapsed the last time Obama and Boehner tried to craft a big budget deal.

The approach carries risks, given the short timetable, the complexity of piecing together a deal and the challenge of lining up enough votes for a controversial package that could include tax hikes and entitlement cuts. The lack of visible movement could rattle Wall Street and Main Street, both of which will face $500 billion in spending cuts and tax increases in the new year if Obama and Congress can’t reach an agreement.

And it could cause both sides to dig in as the rhetoric increasingly shifts from conciliatory to confrontational.

“It seems like our friends on the other side are having some difficulty turning off the campaign,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told reporters Tuesday. “We need to sit down and work this matter out. I think we have a clear sense that there’s an opportunity here at the end of the year to do something important for the country. … So I would hope our friends on the other side can kind of turn off the campaign and get into a cooperative mode here to reach a conclusion.”

The White House isn’t taking McConnell’s advice.

Obama agreed to direct talks with Boehner during the 2011 debt limit showdown — and spent little time making his case to the public. In the White House’s view, the president suffered deeply when he came up short.

Hoping to avoid a repeat, Obama is attempting to leverage public opinion against congressional Republicans, divide their ranks and cast them as the obstacle to continuing a tax break for 98 percent of Americans. When the pressure gets too intense, the White House expects Republicans to fold, just as they did last December when Obama used social media and campaign-style events to win a renewal of the payroll tax cut.

The White House’s strategy is a carbon copy of the payroll tax cut fight, down to a new Twitter campaign and video testimonials from average citizens on what an income tax hike would mean to them.

fiscal_cliff,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/dec/10/obama-hits-road-after-fiscal-cliff-talks-boehner/,Obama hits the road after cliff talks with Boehner,2012-12-10,Dave Boyer,"Stumping for higher taxes on top earners , President Obama Monday also inserted himself squarely into Michigan ’ s boiling debate over a new right-to-work labor law , telling a crowd of Detroit-area auto workers that Republicans pushing for the law are creating political distractions and risking harm to the economy .
“ What we shouldn ’ t be doing is trying to take away your rights to bargain for better wages and working conditions , ” the president said at the Daimler Detroit Diesel plant in Redford , Mich. “ We don ’ t want a race to the bottom , we want a race to the top . ”
He urged the state ’ s GOP-controlled legislature and Republican Gov . Rick Snyder to abandon their efforts to pass the law , which would forbid unions from charging its members dues automatically . Michigan would be the 24th state to adopt the right-to-work law , following Indiana ’ s passage of a similar law in February .
Labor groups and their Democratic allies plan more protests as the bills to implement right-to-work are voted on this week , calling the issue a divisive one in a state long seen as a bastion of the union movement .
“ Folks from our state ’ s capital all the way to the nation ’ s capital should be focused on the same thing , ” Mr. Obama said . “ They should be working to make sure companies like this manufacturer is able to make more great products . America ’ s not going to compete based on low-skill , low-wage , no workers ’ rights — that ’ s not our competitive advantage . ”
He said higher union wages enable workers to buy American products , “ because they ’ ve got enough money in their pockets . ”
But supporters of the right-to-work law , which would undercut a key source of union funding , say Mr. Obama ’ s opposition represents a political payback .
Mark Mix , president of the National Right to Work Committee , said it was “ no surprise ” that Mr. Obama would oppose individual choice for workers .
“ After Big Labor bosses spent nearly a billion dollars in 2008 , and a billion more in 2012 , to elect President Obama and other forced unionism partisans to office , it is expected that President Obama would want to prop up a system of political paybacks that compels workers to pay for union boss politics that benefit Obama and other Big Labor politicians as a condition of employment , ” he said in a statement .
Mr . Mix said private-sector employment has increased 12.5 percent in right-to-work states over the past decade , far better than in states where there is no right-to-work laws .
Fresh from a face-to-face meeting with Speaker John A. Boehner to avert the “ fiscal cliff , ” Mr. Obama visited the auto plant to press his case for higher taxes on wealthier families .
The president said he ’ s “ willing to compromise a little bit ” in the negotiations to reach a deficit-reduction deal , but said he won ’ t compromise on his proposal to hike tax rates on families earning more than $ 250,000 per year , while preserving tax cuts for the middle class .
His visit to the Detroit area also represented something of a victory lap for Mr. Obama , who campaigned heavily for reelection on his support for the auto bailout and accused Republican opponent Mitt Romney of abandoning the industry .

I wasn ’ t about to let that happen . I placed my bet on American workers . Three-and-a-half years later , that bet is paying off . ”
Mr. Obama ’ s trip is the latest in a series of campaign-style events staged by the White House to generate public support for the tax increase . It comes after his Sunday meeting with Mr. Boehner , Ohio Republican , to negotiate a long-term budget deal to avoid automatic tax increases and spending cuts set to take effect in January .

He said the GOP offer of $ 800 billion is “ far , far short of the necessary revenue for a deal that achieves $ 4 trillion in deficit reduction . ”

Supporters say the labor law change , which would exempt police officers and firefighters , would improve the climate for businesses looking to invest in Michigan , whose economy was badly hurt by the long-term decline of the American auto industry and by the recent deep recession .

Mr. Obama said right-to-work laws “ don ’ t have to do with economics . ”
“ They have everything to do with politics , ” he said . “ What they ’ re really talking about is giving you the right to work for less money . You only have to look to Michigan , where workers were instrumental in reviving the auto industry , to see how unions have helped build , not just a stronger middle class , but a stronger America . ”
Before Mr. Obama arrived , Mr. Snyder met privately with some Democratic members of the state ’ s congressional delegation in Detroit , including Sens . Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow and Reps. Hansen Clarke , John Dingell , Gary Peters , David Curson and Rep.-elect Dan Kildee . Mrs. Stabenow participated in the meeting by conference call .
Mr. Levin told reporters after the meeting that the Democratic lawmakers sought a veto or a delay in votes on the measure from the governor . The lawmakers also asked Mr. Snyder to urge Republicans in the state legislature to seek revision in the bills that would allow Michigan voters the right to take up right-to-work laws via a ballot referendum . Currently , the one House bill and two Senate bills incorporating the right-to-work measure include appropriations of $ 1 million , making them immune from future ballot referendum appeals under state law .
In Washington , Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid issuing an angry statement in support of union interests , decrying partisanship .
“ This is a blatant attempt by Michigan Republicans to assault the collective bargaining process and undermine the standard of living it has helped foster , ” Mr. Reid said . “ This effort continues a dangerous trend set by Republican-led state legislatures across the nation , and it is another instance of the tea party needlessly sowing division and setting Republicans ’ economic agenda .
“ Elected officials , labor leaders and business leaders can and should work towards the common goals of job-creation , improving our economy and strengthening middle-class families , ” said Mr. Reid . “ But this partisan power grab is a setback to prospects for compromise . ”","Stumping for higher taxes on top earners, President Obama Monday also inserted himself squarely into Michigan’s boiling debate over a new right-to-work labor law, telling a crowd of Detroit-area auto workers that Republicans pushing for the law are creating political distractions and risking harm to the economy.

“What we shouldn’t be doing is trying to take away your rights to bargain for better wages and working conditions,” the president said at the Daimler Detroit Diesel plant in Redford, Mich. “We don’t want a race to the bottom, we want a race to the top.”

He urged the state’s GOP-controlled legislature and Republican Gov. Rick Snyder to abandon their efforts to pass the law, which would forbid unions from charging its members dues automatically. Michigan would be the 24th state to adopt the right-to-work law, following Indiana’s passage of a similar law in February.

Labor groups and their Democratic allies plan more protests as the bills to implement right-to-work are voted on this week, calling the issue a divisive one in a state long seen as a bastion of the union movement.

“Folks from our state’s capital all the way to the nation’s capital should be focused on the same thing,” Mr. Obama said. “They should be working to make sure companies like this manufacturer is able to make more great products. America’s not going to compete based on low-skill, low-wage, no workers’ rights — that’s not our competitive advantage.”

He said higher union wages enable workers to buy American products, “because they’ve got enough money in their pockets.”

But supporters of the right-to-work law, which would undercut a key source of union funding, say Mr. Obama’s opposition represents a political payback.

Mark Mix, president of the National Right to Work Committee, said it was “no surprise” that Mr. Obama would oppose individual choice for workers.

“After Big Labor bosses spent nearly a billion dollars in 2008, and a billion more in 2012, to elect President Obama and other forced unionism partisans to office, it is expected that President Obama would want to prop up a system of political paybacks that compels workers to pay for union boss politics that benefit Obama and other Big Labor politicians as a condition of employment,” he said in a statement.

Mr. Mix said private-sector employment has increased 12.5 percent in right-to-work states over the past decade, far better than in states where there is no right-to-work laws.

Victory lap

Fresh from a face-to-face meeting with Speaker John A. Boehner to avert the “fiscal cliff,” Mr. Obama visited the auto plant to press his case for higher taxes on wealthier families.

The president said he’s “willing to compromise a little bit” in the negotiations to reach a deficit-reduction deal, but said he won’t compromise on his proposal to hike tax rates on families earning more than $250,000 per year, while preserving tax cuts for the middle class.

His visit to the Detroit area also represented something of a victory lap for Mr. Obama, who campaigned heavily for reelection on his support for the auto bailout and accused Republican opponent Mitt Romney of abandoning the industry. Mr. Obama carried the state Nov. 6, despite the fact that his GOP rival was born there.

The president praised the German-based Daimler for announcing Monday that it will invest $125 million in an expansion of its U.S. operations, creating 115 new jobs.

I wasn’t about to let that happen. I placed my bet on American workers. Three-and-a-half years later, that bet is paying off.”

Legislative fast track

Both the White House and Congress want to avert massive budget cuts and tax hikes early next year , a situation popularly called the `` fiscal cliff . ''
The challenge has been brewing for years . But its current prominence owes much to the decades-long lobbying of billionaire Peter G. Peterson and his private foundation .
`` For over a quarter of a century , I 've been railing relentlessly , and boring others — and sometimes even myself — over our long-term , unsustainable debts , '' Peterson said in typically self-deprecating remarks at a conference held last week in Washington .
While he was once U.S. commerce secretary , that was four decades ago under President Richard Nixon . Still , it was Peterson 's money that helped create the Simpson-Bowles commission , which crafted one proposal combining tax hikes and spending cuts . And his is the money behind the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and its Fix the Debt campaign .
`` As long as people are worshiping the great god of re-election ... then we 're going to have a hard time getting to the Promised Land , '' said Erskine Bowles , appearing last spring on the Charlie Rose TV show .
Peterson was also behind the task force headed by fiscal expert Alice Rivlin and former Sen. Pete Domenici , R-N.M .
`` I believe leadership , including leadership from the president , is going to make this a war , a war on this debt . And if we do that , we might win , '' Domenici said two years ago on PBS NewsHour .
After serving in the Nixon administration , Peterson moved into investment banking and private equity — and did very well . When he retired , he was a billionaire , but one with a cause .
Think tanks from the Employment Policies Institute on the left to the Heritage Foundation on the right were at the conference last week talking about their proposed solutions , which are funded by Peterson Foundation grants .
Other groups Peterson has backed include The Concord Coalition , which he co-founded , and the grass-roots organizer AmericaSpeaks .
All in all , the Peterson Foundation has given out nearly $ 26 million over the past three years , almost all of it aimed at attacking the debt .
At the liberal Campaign for America 's Future , Robert Borosage questions if that 's the right strategy . `` Fix the debt , as opposed to fix the economy . Right ? '' he says . `` And there 's a big difference between the two when you 're in the midst of a faltering recovery and you 've still got over 20 million people in need of full-time work . ''
Borosage says Peterson spread money around , so now the national debt is on everybody 's agenda .
`` If he can get liberal groups to argue about the debt , and conservative groups to argue about the debt , and they argue about it in different ways , I think he sees that as success , '' Borosage said .
Borosage and other liberals argue that dwelling on the debt will mean drastic cuts in programs that help low- and middle-income Americans .
This is n't at all what Peterson says he intends . In a video posted online by the foundation , he said this about safety-net programs such as Medicare , Medicaid and Society Security : `` I would hate to get , to permit ourselves to get into a position where these programs for the vulnerable were cut . ''
As for the notion of sparing high-income `` job creators '' from higher taxes , he says : `` I would think that if the upper-class suffers far more than anyone else , both in terms of tax increases and benefit cuts , the middle-class would be far more willing to accept at least some sacrifice . ''
But setting intentions aside , it 's extremely rare that any one individual has so much impact on a big policy question .
Peterson 's son , Michael , the foundation 's president , tells NPR that his father 's role is n't really all that powerful .
`` I think the main reason we are seeing a chorus of individuals calling for a solution on our fiscal challenges is because it 's so obviously hurting our economy , '' he says .
But others say Peter G. Peterson has largely driven the debate .
`` I would call him the conductor of an orchestra of many people and events , that have put a focus on debt and the deficit since the mid-'80s , '' says James Thurber , a professor at American University where he oversees the Public Affairs and Advocacy Institute .
It 's an orchestra that few would have the stamina , or the financial wherewithal , to assemble or conduct .","Fiscal Cliff Siren: Meet The Man Behind The Curtain

Debate over the long-term debt and the annual deficit has dominated the post-election agenda. Both the White House and Congress want to avert massive budget cuts and tax hikes early next year, a situation popularly called the ""fiscal cliff.""

The challenge has been brewing for years. But its current prominence owes much to the decades-long lobbying of billionaire Peter G. Peterson and his private foundation.

""For over a quarter of a century, I've been railing relentlessly, and boring others — and sometimes even myself — over our long-term, unsustainable debts,"" Peterson said in typically self-deprecating remarks at a conference held last week in Washington.

Peterson was also behind the task force headed by fiscal expert Alice Rivlin and former Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.

""I believe leadership, including leadership from the president, is going to make this a war, a war on this debt. And if we do that, we might win,"" Domenici said two years ago on PBS NewsHour.

After serving in the Nixon administration, Peterson moved into investment banking and private equity — and did very well. When he retired, he was a billionaire, but one with a cause.

Think tanks from the Employment Policies Institute on the left to the Heritage Foundation on the right were at the conference last week talking about their proposed solutions, which are funded by Peterson Foundation grants.

Other groups Peterson has backed include The Concord Coalition, which he co-founded, and the grass-roots organizer AmericaSpeaks.

All in all, the Peterson Foundation has given out nearly $26 million over the past three years, almost all of it aimed at attacking the debt.

At the liberal Campaign for America's Future, Robert Borosage questions if that's the right strategy. ""Fix the debt, as opposed to fix the economy. Right?"" he says. ""And there's a big difference between the two when you're in the midst of a faltering recovery and you've still got over 20 million people in need of full-time work.""

Borosage says Peterson spread money around, so now the national debt is on everybody's agenda.

""If he can get liberal groups to argue about the debt, and conservative groups to argue about the debt, and they argue about it in different ways, I think he sees that as success,"" Borosage said.

Borosage and other liberals argue that dwelling on the debt will mean drastic cuts in programs that help low- and middle-income Americans.

This isn't at all what Peterson says he intends. In a video posted online by the foundation, he said this about safety-net programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Society Security: ""I would hate to get, to permit ourselves to get into a position where these programs for the vulnerable were cut.""

As for the notion of sparing high-income ""job creators"" from higher taxes, he says: ""I would think that if the upper-class suffers far more than anyone else, both in terms of tax increases and benefit cuts, the middle-class would be far more willing to accept at least some sacrifice.""

But setting intentions aside, it's extremely rare that any one individual has so much impact on a big policy question.

Peterson's son, Michael, the foundation's president, tells NPR that his father's role isn't really all that powerful.

""I think the main reason we are seeing a chorus of individuals calling for a solution on our fiscal challenges is because it's so obviously hurting our economy,"" he says.

But others say Peter G. Peterson has largely driven the debate.

""I would call him the conductor of an orchestra of many people and events, that have put a focus on debt and the deficit since the mid-'80s,"" says James Thurber, a professor at American University where he oversees the Public Affairs and Advocacy Institute.

It's an orchestra that few would have the stamina, or the financial wherewithal, to assemble or conduct.",www.npr.org,center,4phF865UMVI5B2h9

Obama had hoped the election would unclog the works in Washington. His aides often speculated that he’d be freer to negotiate because he didn’t have to run again — and Republicans didn’t have to run against him.

But Thursday’s revolt was a grim reminder of how closely Obama’s future is tethered to that of his political rivals.

If House Speaker John Boehner can’t muscle his own bill through the House, his power to persuade his colleagues to accept a deal with the White House appears greatly diminished. And that means it might be tough for Obama to forge any agreement with House Republicans to avert the fiscal cliff this year — or to push through his second-term agenda in the years to come.

The path forward looked unclear even to senior administration officials late Thursday.

Aides had thought the House wrangling would stretch past midnight, so many had left the White House early in the evening — only to see Boehner pull the bill from floor at 8 p.m., much sooner than expected. They took it as a sign that Boehner wasn’t even close.

Obama press secretary Jay Carney released a purposefully restrained statement — a shift after days of senior administration officials accusing Boehner of strategic incompetence and political cowardice. The president will work with Congress, Carney said, to find a bipartisan solution.

But by the time Carney responded, Boehner had already signaled that he had no intention of returning to the bargaining table with Obama. After his own strategy backfired, Boehner said in a statement that Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) needed to come up with a solution — not exactly the message that the White House was hoping to hear.

''
The feisty exchange came as both sides crept toward a possible middle ground in private talks . But underscoring the differences that remain , the White House resisted Boehner 's bid to craft a `` Plan B '' just in case those talks fail to yield a compromise before a Jan. 1 deadline -- that 's when taxes are set to rise on everyone , followed by a wave of spending cuts .
`` Every income tax filer in America is going to pay higher rates come Jan. 1 unless Congress acts , '' Boehner said Tuesday morning , as he introduced his alternative plan .
Boehner called for taxes to rise only on households making more than $ 1 million . His plan also called for entitlement cuts and a tax reform debate next year .
White House Press Secretary Jay Carney , though , said it `` does n't ask enough of the very wealthiest in taxes and instead shifts the burden to the middle class and seniors , '' and can not pass the Senate .
Within minutes , Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck fired back : `` After spending months saying we must ask for more from millionaires and billionaires , how can they reject a plan that does exactly that ? ''
Buck accused President Obama of `` moving the goal posts '' and in the process `` threatening every American family with higher taxes . ''
Boehner , with no less than his leadership standing on the line , is trying to walk a tightrope in negotiations as the president demands tax hikes that many Republicans adamantly oppose .
His call for a `` Plan B '' could be a failsafe option , in case Boehner is unable to secure the votes to pass any future deal struck with the White House . But it also could be aimed at spurring Obama to compromise a bit more .
A Boehner aide said the speaker is `` hopeful an agreement will be reached , '' but complained that the president 's latest counteroffer includes $ 1.3 trillion in revenue increases and `` only '' $ 850 billion in spending cuts .
`` The threat of all current tax rates expiring is too great to not have a backup plan , '' the aide said .
House Republican Leader Eric Cantor , putting pressure on the president , said the `` alternative plan '' is being discussed in case Obama `` can not come our way . ''
`` He has not come to where he needs to be , '' Cantor said .
A big challenge for Boehner is whether he can sell any compromise struck with the White House to rank-and-file Republicans . His offer to raise taxes on those making more than $ 1 million drew the ire of some conservatives , as did talk that he 's considering allowing a debt ceiling increase that would prevent a battle over that issue for another year .
Obama , though , is demanding far more . In an offer presented Monday , the president asked for a two-year reprieve on the debt ceiling . He backed off his position that tax rates rise on households making more than $ 250,000 , upping the threshold to $ 400,000 -- but that 's still a bigger swath of taxpayers than Boehner is looking at . Plus , the president continues to call for stimulus spending to be part of the package .
For taxpayers , a host of benefits and tax provisions are on the line . Without a deal , tax rates rise for everyone -- with middle-income families facing a roughly $ 2,000 increase next year . Capital gains and dividends rates would also go up , and long-term unemployment aid would expire .
With a deal , most Americans would likely be spared major tax increases -- but those making above a certain threshold could still be hit , depending on what both sides agree to . Certain entitlement programs could also be cut , including Medicare and Social Security . Obama has indicated he 's willing to agree to smaller cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients .
In terms of logistics , the House is tentatively planning to take up the `` Plan B '' proposal later this week , as early as Thursday . They would do it by amending a bill previously passed by the Senate that tracked more with Obama 's original offer .
Then , the House would send the bill back to the Senate -- where it would likely sit as a potential last resort in case Obama and Boehner can not strike a deal .
The Boehner alternative plan was getting mixed reviews Tuesday from Republican House members . But on the Democratic side , leaders expressed swift opposition even before the White House came out against it .
`` Speaker Boehner 's 'plan B ' is the farthest thing from a balanced approach , '' Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid 's office said in a statement . `` It will not protect middle class families because it can not pass both Houses of Congress . ''
House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer called it a `` political ploy , '' and said Democratic leaders would urge their members to vote against it .
