[pullquote]

It’s not that the measure would have passed the Senate, but it would have been the starting point in which a deal was done to avert most of the tax increase.

Instead, it looks increasingly likely that the hammer will fall and Obama will get his way. Once the Bush-era rates die off, Obama will have a year in which to wheedle new tax policy out of Republicans, starting from a higher baseline. What most expected would be the Obama tax hike are instead now likely be the Obama tax cuts.

Republicans could talk, post-cliff, about what tax rates were before, but that is like talking about what government spending was before the age of Obama: a complicated, backward-looking argument that will draw little water with voters.

There is much magical thinking on the right these days. The central tenet of these fantasies is that jumping the cliff will trigger a scorching recession and that Obama will be pressured into accepting the return to the previous rates – that facing an economy headed for oblivion Obama will be forced to give in.

Does that sound the Obama you know? Especially the emboldened, re-elected Obama?

Conservative cliff jumpers argue that since voters chose Obama, they deserve to get what they voted for, namely a big tax increase. The thinking is that once people see the disaster that tax increases wreak on the economy, they will come running for Republicanism.

But whatever the Mayans say, the recession would not come like a meteor crashing into the economy. It would be like a rising tide that swamps one sector after another. The electorate, spoon fed daily on White House talking points, would not bring their pitchforks and demand Obama relent. They would instead watch their paychecks shrink and the economy submerge and despair.

Voters would blame both parties and both branches of government and would demand action. And in that case, it would be House members, facing voters in less than two years who will feel the greatest pressure, not the president.

It’s true that Obama is risking his legacy and any chance at a fruitful second term with his brinksmanship, but he is also gaining the chance to be a truly transformative liberal president. If he can break the back of the Republicans in the next two years and perhaps even regain the House in midterms, he would have the chance to truly remake government and the nation.

Obama is ready to make the gamble and so far, Republicans are doing just as he hoped.

Conservatives arguing that now is the time to let it all come crashing down are angry at Obama, angry at voters, angry at their party’s leadership. Part of this is resentment among conservatives who are angry at voters for re-electing a president the right believes is not just incompetent but wicked. The fact that a majority of voters chose Obama galls many Republicans who think that this election was the tipping point moment in which the takers overtook the makers.

This has led them to convince themselves that not avoiding all of an automatic tax increase is the same as voting to increase taxes. They are embracing this fiscal doomsday scenario on the grounds that out of the ashes will rise a purified Republican Party, a chastened electorate and a weakened Obama.

But last night’s debacle is proving to be a gut-check moment for those in the “the worse the better” crowd. Many of those opposed to Boehner’s plan did so believing that it would pass anyway and that they would be able to say “I told you so” when the final deal was done with Democrats.

Having actually managed to block the plan and with the start of their doomsday scenario now just days away, will so many feel so sanguine about a strategy that sounded good in the aftermath of the election but is now confronting reality?

And Now, A Word From Charles

“I'll just add one thing. If the ‘Plan B’ does not succeed, if he fails in the House, Boehner has a ‘Plan C.’ That's the Mayan apocalypse [today].”

Democrats countered with a proposal to extend expiring Bush-era tax cuts up to $ 360,000 for individuals and $ 450,000 for couples . For both sides , that meant major movement .

Even on the estate tax , the two sides are not far apart , although their language is . Republicans want to tax estates valued above $ 5 million at 35 percent . Democrats want to tax inheritances above $ 3.5 million at 45 percent .
If that sounds like a bridgeable divide , Democrats are not conceding an inch . “ The net result is that 6,000 Americans would get a $ 1-million-a-year tax break on their estate tax , ” Mr. Durbin said . “ The Republicans once again are ready to shut us down over not 2 percent of the population , but 0.1 percent of the population . ”","“Talk to Joe Biden and McConnell,” Mr. Reid told reporters when asked if negotiations were continuing.

In the balance are more than a half-trillion dollars in tax increases on virtually every working American and across-the-board spending cuts that are scheduled to begin Tuesday. Taken together, they threaten to push the economy back into recession.

“It looks awful,” said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois , the second-ranking Democrat. “I’m sure the American people are saying, with so much at stake why are they waiting so late to get this done?”

Congressional Republicans criticized for threatening deal

Congress went beyond the edge of the fiscal cliff to get a deal done in back-to-back, late-night sessions to avert a financial crisis, or at least to put it off for a couple months. Here are winners and losers in the deal:

Winners

Vice President Joe Biden: This might not have been the ""Big f***ing deal"" that he proclaimed the passage of Obamacare to be, but it was a pretty big deal. Biden used his years of experience cutting deals in the Senate to work out a compromise with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. He used the same playbook in the first extension of the Bush-era tax cuts in 2010 and the debt ceiling fight in 2011, walking through the proposal with progressives in the Senate and then the House to bring them in line.

Biden hasn't ruled out a run for the White House when Obama's second term is up and his role in this deal makes a President Biden believable.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell: He found the He found the ""dance partner"" he was looking for in Biden and skillfully worked behind the scenes with the vice president to broker a deal that got overwhelming Republican support in the Senate.

It's too early to tell whether McConnell will pay the price with hard-line conservatives at home in Kentucky who have already shown that they can oust Senate incumbents who anger them by working with Democrats.

Step one : Republicans propose an idea that high-ranking Democrats have explicitly supported in the very recent past . Step two : Democrats unceremoniously dump all over the idea , calling it `` unacceptable , '' `` dead on arrival , '' or whatever the dismissive pejorative of the day may be . Step three : Drink ( and I 've got just the beverage in mind for this occasion ) . The trouble is that by this stage in our interminable cliff charade , everyone involved would be too wasted to negotiate any further -- which actually might not be the worst thing in the world , come to think of it . Katie outlined Boehner 's `` plan B '' yesterday morning , and later mentioned initial pooh-poohing by the White House . By dinnertime , every Democrat in existence had shouted into a microphone somewhere about what a rotten idea it was :
The White House and congressional Democrats swiftly panned Speaker John A. Boehner ’ s plan to push legislation in the House that would let tax rates rise only for millionaires , the Ohio Republican ’ s “ plan B ” to avert the fiscal cliff . White House Press Secretary Jay Carney issued a statement saying the president remains willing to work with Republicans to reach a bipartisan solution to the fiscal cliff and he is “ hopeful ” they will . The president , however , “ is not willing to accept a deal that doesn ’ t ask enough of the very wealthiest in taxes and instead shifts the burden to the middle class and seniors , ” Carney said . “ The Speaker ’ s ‘ Plan B ’ approach doesn ’ t meet this test because it can ’ t pass the Senate and therefore will not protect middle class families , and does little to address our fiscal challenges with zero spending cuts . ”
Yes , you just read the White House Press Secretary attacking Boehner 's plan B for not cutting enough spending -- unlike the president 's very balanced and responsible $ 1.6 Trillion tax hike/limitless debt ceiling/new `` stimulus '' proposal , natch . This gripe also ignores the $ 1 trillion in sequestration cuts , which would remain in effect . Nevertheless , Democrats are still pounding on the table , demanding that Republicans list more explicit spending cuts that they can reject immediately and demagogue for months . Good times . Nancy Pelosi are vowing to whip House Democrats against Boehner 's $ 1 trillion threshold suggestion , which was .... her plan just a few months back :
Is House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi abandoning President Barack Obama in his effort to raise taxes on households making more than $ 250,000 ? It sure sounded that way on Wednesday . In a letter to House Speaker John Boehner , Ms. Pelosi called on Republicans to pass a permanent extension of Bush-era tax levels for the middle class . The only group Ms. Pelosi singled out for a tax increase was people earning $ 1 million or more . “ We must ask the very wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share , ” she wrote in her letter . “ Democrats believe that tax cuts for those earning over a million dollars a year should expire and that we should use the resulting revenues to pay down the deficit . ”
`` Democrats '' no longer believe this , apparently . They are back to the $ 250,000 number , and the president plans to use the `` resulting revenues '' to finance more spending . Which was always the plan anyway . Asked to explain her remarkable shift , Pelosi proudly announced that her previous idea was nothing more than `` an exercise '' to `` smoke out the Republicans . '' Her deputy , Steny Hoyer , shrugged it off as a `` political ploy . '' Such good faith actors , these Democrats . And before you ask , of course a bunch of liberal Democrats in the Senate have also embraced Boehner 's Plan B The Most Reckless Plan Evah at one time or another . So where to go from here ? First off , a deal may still be in the offing , although it 'll likely stink to high heaven . Then there 's the cliff diving option , which would be very risky for Republicans , despite Democrats ' mind-numbing malfeasance . Next comes the `` vote present and make Democrats own virtually anything they want '' idea , which I just do n't see Republicans pulling off . ( In fairness , it would be the textbook definition of capitulation ) . And finally , we could see yet another round of Republicans negotiating against themselves . Allahpundit games it out :
Boehner could turn up the heat on O even further by dropping the threshold for new taxes from millionaires to households that earn more than $ 400,000 a year . That was the cut-off that Obama himself proposed yesterday , remember ; he ’ d be giving O exactly what he asked for and then daring him to veto it or the Democrats to block it . He could even hold a splashy “ you win ” presser before skipping town for Christmas , denouncing the bill as a piece of crap that ’ ll hurt the economy but one which the House feels obliged to pass because it ’ s the only way to stop Obama from forcing the country over the cliff . If Democrats respond by refusing to take yes for an answer and blocking the bill , then the economic chaos when we fall off the cliff is entirely on them .
It should be entirely on them under this scenario , but would our friends in the media assess culpability clearly and fairly for public consumption ? ( Do n't answer that ; it 's a rhetorical question ) . And since when do Democrats have any compunction whatsoever about blocking their own proposals and blaming Republicans anyway ? That 's the entire point of this post ; they do it all the time . Hey , if they can consistently get away with this sort of juvenile , hopelessly unconstructive posturing without paying a political price , why would they quit now ?
UPDATE - Option five could also be a last-ditch effort , wherein the House GOP passes two bills -- one acceding to the $ 250,000 mark , and the other extending current rates for everyone . They could all vote for the latter item ( it 'd die in the Senate ) , then Boehner and Cantor would piece together enough votes to pass the former . The Senate would surely sign off on that .... right ? The one Easter Egg I 'd also include is making those middle cut tax cuts permanent , which could put Dems in a bind down the road if they agree to it . And they have no good excuse to oppose it , given their endless `` certainty for the middle class '' talking points .","This could make for one hell of a drinking game. Step one: Republicans propose an idea that high-ranking Democrats have explicitly supported in the very recent past. Step two: Democrats unceremoniously dump all over the idea, calling it ""unacceptable,"" ""dead on arrival,"" or whatever the dismissive pejorative of the day may be. Step three: Drink (and I've got just the beverage in mind for this occasion). The trouble is that by this stage in our interminable cliff charade, everyone involved would be too wasted to negotiate any further -- which actually might not be the worst thing in the world, come to think of it. Katie outlined Boehner's ""plan B"" yesterday morning, and later mentioned initial pooh-poohing by the White House. By dinnertime, every Democrat in existence had shouted into a microphone somewhere about what a rotten idea it was:



The White House and congressional Democrats swiftly panned Speaker John A. Boehner’s plan to push legislation in the House that would let tax rates rise only for millionaires, the Ohio Republican’s “plan B” to avert the fiscal cliff. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney issued a statement saying the president remains willing to work with Republicans to reach a bipartisan solution to the fiscal cliff and he is “hopeful” they will. The president, however, “is not willing to accept a deal that doesn’t ask enough of the very wealthiest in taxes and instead shifts the burden to the middle class and seniors,” Carney said. “The Speaker’s ‘Plan B’ approach doesn’t meet this test because it can’t pass the Senate and therefore will not protect middle class families, and does little to address our fiscal challenges with zero spending cuts.”



Yes, you just read the White House Press Secretary attacking Boehner's plan B for not cutting enough spending -- unlike the president's very balanced and responsible $1.6 Trillion tax hike/limitless debt ceiling/new ""stimulus"" proposal, natch. This gripe also ignores the $1 trillion in sequestration cuts, which would remain in effect. Nevertheless, Democrats are still pounding on the table, demanding that Republicans list more explicit spending cuts that they can reject immediately and demagogue for months. Good times. Nancy Pelosi are vowing to whip House Democrats against Boehner's $1 trillion threshold suggestion, which was....her plan just a few months back:



Is House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi abandoning President Barack Obama in his effort to raise taxes on households making more than $250,000? It sure sounded that way on Wednesday. In a letter to House Speaker John Boehner, Ms. Pelosi called on Republicans to pass a permanent extension of Bush-era tax levels for the middle class. The only group Ms. Pelosi singled out for a tax increase was people earning $1 million or more. “We must ask the very wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share,” she wrote in her letter. “Democrats believe that tax cuts for those earning over a million dollars a year should expire and that we should use the resulting revenues to pay down the deficit.”



""Democrats"" no longer believe this, apparently. They are back to the $250,000 number, and the president plans to use the ""resulting revenues"" to finance more spending. Which was always the plan anyway. Asked to explain her remarkable shift, Pelosi proudly announced that her previous idea was nothing more than ""an exercise"" to ""smoke out the Republicans."" Her deputy, Steny Hoyer, shrugged it off as a ""political ploy."" Such good faith actors, these Democrats. And before you ask, of course a bunch of liberal Democrats in the Senate have also embraced Boehner's Plan B The Most Reckless Plan Evah at one time or another. So where to go from here? First off, a deal may still be in the offing, although it'll likely stink to high heaven. Then there's the cliff diving option, which would be very risky for Republicans, despite Democrats' mind-numbing malfeasance. Next comes the ""vote present and make Democrats own virtually anything they want"" idea, which I just don't see Republicans pulling off. (In fairness, it would be the textbook definition of capitulation). And finally, we could see yet another round of Republicans negotiating against themselves. Allahpundit games it out:



Boehner could turn up the heat on O even further by dropping the threshold for new taxes from millionaires to households that earn more than $400,000 a year. That was the cut-off that Obama himself proposed yesterday, remember; he’d be giving O exactly what he asked for and then daring him to veto it or the Democrats to block it. He could even hold a splashy “you win” presser before skipping town for Christmas, denouncing the bill as a piece of crap that’ll hurt the economy but one which the House feels obliged to pass because it’s the only way to stop Obama from forcing the country over the cliff. If Democrats respond by refusing to take yes for an answer and blocking the bill, then the economic chaos when we fall off the cliff is entirely on them.



It should be entirely on them under this scenario, but would our friends in the media assess culpability clearly and fairly for public consumption? (Don't answer that; it's a rhetorical question). And since when do Democrats have any compunction whatsoever about blocking their own proposals and blaming Republicans anyway? That's the entire point of this post; they do it all the time. Hey, if they can consistently get away with this sort of juvenile, hopelessly unconstructive posturing without paying a political price, why would they quit now?



UPDATE - Option five could also be a last-ditch effort, wherein the House GOP passes two bills -- one acceding to the $250,000 mark, and the other extending current rates for everyone. They could all vote for the latter item (it'd die in the Senate), then Boehner and Cantor would piece together enough votes to pass the former. The Senate would surely sign off on that....right? The one Easter Egg I'd also include is making those middle cut tax cuts permanent, which could put Dems in a bind down the road if they agree to it. And they have no good excuse to oppose it, given their endless ""certainty for the middle class"" talking points.",www.townhall.com,right,nn8esguAh9FBDjWF

Their statements followed a similar one Thursday by Georgia Republican Sen.

The Senate 's top Democrat and Republican are working this weekend to forge a compromise to prevent the country from going over the fiscal cliff , the combination of sweeping spending cuts and widespread tax increases that will otherwise take effect in days .
By mid-day Saturday , Senate aides from both parties reported no major developments in the talks . That may not be a bad sign , as a Democratic aide earlier said his side would probably leak a Republican offer it considers `` laughable '' but would keep it private if the proposals were reasonable .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell did tell reporters early Saturday evening , `` We 've been trading paper all day , and the talks continue into the evening . ''
`` We 've been in discussions all day and they continue , '' the Kentucky Republican said . `` We 'll let you know as soon as we have some news to make . ''
The Senate aides said they expect no details will be divulged until Sunday afternoon , when McConnell and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nevada , will update their Republican and Democratic caucuses , respectively .

House Republicans will get together sometime early Sunday night , according to a note sent to legislators and staffers . House Speaker John Boehner has called on the Senate to go first , and then his chamber -- which reconvenes Sunday -- will act .
Early Friday evening after a meeting involving President Obama , congressional leaders and top administration officials , the president said he was `` modestly optimistic `` the Senate leaders would reach an agreement . At the same time , he conceded , `` Nobody 's going to get 100 % of what they want . ''
The weekend talks are being led by the two senators ' chiefs of staff -- David Krone for Reid , and Sharron Soderstrom for McConnell -- communicating largely over the phone and by e-mail , aides said .
Staffers for Boehner , the top man in the Republican-led House of Representatives , wo n't directly take part in the negotiations , but they 'll be kept informed by McConnell 's staff , a GOP aide said . From the White House , Obama has been in close contact with negotiators , a senior administration official said Saturday .
Democrats believe Republicans should make the `` first move '' -- basically by saying how they want to alter the president 's proposal , which calls for tax rates to stay the same for all annual family income below $ 250,000 . The expectation is Republicans will try to raise that income threshold to $ 400,000 and push to keep estate taxes low ; Democrats said they might be open to one such scenario , but not both .
If the two sides do n't agree on a bill over the weekend , Obama said he wants his latest proposal to be put up for a vote in both the Senate and House . He predicted his plan -- which , in addition to his tax rate proposal , would extend unemployment benefits and `` lay the groundwork '' for deficit reduction -- would pass in both chambers with bipartisan support .
As members of Congress and their staffs talk , Obama will make his case to the public by appearing Sunday on NBC 's `` Meet the Press , '' his first appearance on a Sunday political talk show in three years . The appearance follows his weekly radio address , given Saturday , in which he said it was Republicans ' `` prerogative '' to `` let this tax hike hit the middle class , '' while Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri countered by accusing Democrats of spending `` months drawing partisan lines in the sand . ''
Reid said , at the very least , that he 'd prepare legislation that includes elements favored by Obama for a vote by Monday . Still , he insisted he 'd first work with his GOP colleagues .
`` I look forward to hearing any good-faith proposals Sen. McConnell has for altering this bill , '' the Nevada Democrat said .
If no legislation passes both chambers and therefore is n't signed by the president by year 's end , the fiscal cliff will go into effect -- something economists warn could trigger a recession .

McConnell and Harry Reid should update their caucuses, perhaps with an agreement, on Sunday

There will be major cuts and widespread tax increases without a deal by year's end

Some congressmen say Americans have a right to be frustrated by the stalemate

The Senate's top Democrat and Republican are working this weekend to forge a compromise to prevent the country from going over the fiscal cliff, the combination of sweeping spending cuts and widespread tax increases that will otherwise take effect in days.

By mid-day Saturday, Senate aides from both parties reported no major developments in the talks. That may not be a bad sign, as a Democratic aide earlier said his side would probably leak a Republican offer it considers ""laughable"" but would keep it private if the proposals were reasonable.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell did tell reporters early Saturday evening, ""We've been trading paper all day, and the talks continue into the evening.""

""We've been in discussions all day and they continue,"" the Kentucky Republican said. ""We'll let you know as soon as we have some news to make.""

The Senate aides said they expect no details will be divulged until Sunday afternoon, when McConnell and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, will update their Republican and Democratic caucuses, respectively.

House Republicans will get together sometime early Sunday night, according to a note sent to legislators and staffers. House Speaker John Boehner has called on the Senate to go first, and then his chamber -- which reconvenes Sunday -- will act.

Early Friday evening after a meeting involving President Obama, congressional leaders and top administration officials, the president said he was "" modestly optimistic "" the Senate leaders would reach an agreement. At the same time, he conceded, ""Nobody's going to get 100% of what they want.""

The weekend talks are being led by the two senators' chiefs of staff -- David Krone for Reid, and Sharron Soderstrom for McConnell -- communicating largely over the phone and by e-mail, aides said.

Staffers for Boehner, the top man in the Republican-led House of Representatives, won't directly take part in the negotiations, but they'll be kept informed by McConnell's staff, a GOP aide said. From the White House, Obama has been in close contact with negotiators, a senior administration official said Saturday.

Democrats believe Republicans should make the ""first move"" -- basically by saying how they want to alter the president's proposal, which calls for tax rates to stay the same for all annual family income below $250,000. The expectation is Republicans will try to raise that income threshold to $400,000 and push to keep estate taxes low; Democrats said they might be open to one such scenario, but not both.

If the two sides don't agree on a bill over the weekend, Obama said he wants his latest proposal to be put up for a vote in both the Senate and House. He predicted his plan -- which, in addition to his tax rate proposal, would extend unemployment benefits and ""lay the groundwork"" for deficit reduction -- would pass in both chambers with bipartisan support.

As members of Congress and their staffs talk, Obama will make his case to the public by appearing Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" his first appearance on a Sunday political talk show in three years. The appearance follows his weekly radio address , given Saturday, in which he said it was Republicans' ""prerogative"" to ""let this tax hike hit the middle class,"" while Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri countered by accusing Democrats of spending ""months drawing partisan lines in the sand.""

Reid said, at the very least, that he'd prepare legislation that includes elements favored by Obama for a vote by Monday. Still, he insisted he'd first work with his GOP colleagues.

""I look forward to hearing any good-faith proposals Sen. McConnell has for altering this bill,"" the Nevada Democrat said.

If no legislation passes both chambers and therefore isn't signed by the president by year's end, the fiscal cliff will go into effect -- something economists warn could trigger a recession.

The lack of political movement thus far, and lack of confidence Washington politicians can get anything done with so little time left, has spurred consumer confidence to sag and stock market values to sink.

The expiration of Bush-era tax cuts. A patch to the alternative minimum tax. An increase in capital gains taxes.

As the ""fiscal cliff"" approaches, all of these are possible, but none certain. That uncertainty solicits many questions from anxious taxpayers. But, for accountants and financial planners, there are a few definitive answers.

Financial professionals who spoke with NPR say they are not strangers to uncertainty. When the Bush tax cuts were up for expiration two years ago, for instance, the feeling was similar.

""Every time there's a significant change in tax law, you have to retool and learn things,"" says Mark Burger, a CPA in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.

But the fiscal cliff, with its host of associated changes, presents a challenge unlike anything the pros have dealt with in the past.

""The difference this year is the volume and the unprecedented amount of issues coming at the same time,"" says Ed Karl, vice president of taxation of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.

Clients, they say, crave certainty. Although they can't provide that, professionals say, they can be honest about what they don't know, and help their clients prepare for possible futures.

""Our job is to make clients aware of these issues and be in a position to act when these rules become final,"" says Daniel Joss, a financial planner in Reston, Va.

One thing they can do, Karl says, is to work with clients on scenario planning.

""In other words, 'Let's talk about your situation. If this happens or doesn't happen politically, then we should do this, or I recommend you do this.'

""Normally at the end of the year you're thinking of deferring income to the next year and accelerating expenses into the current year. This year you're probably looking at the reverse of taking income earlier into this year where the rates and the preferential rates are almost certain to change next year,"" Karl says.

But not everything is up in the air.

After Jan. 1, for instance, the record-high exemption for estates and gifts is expected to drop to $1 million from $5.12 million. For people with lots of money to give, it may be time to make that transaction.

The Associated Press reports that financial advisers and trust and estate attorneys have been ""flooded"" with requests from those who wish to make financial gifts and create trusts. Joss, the financial planner, says he has handled such requests.

Bush made bipartisan deals with Democrats on education , energy and , shortly before leaving office , the bank bailout known as TARP . President Reagan got together with Democrats on tax reform and Social Security . President Clinton reached agreement with Republicans on welfare reform , balancing the budget and Nafta 's free trade . Mr. Clinton also negotiated reform of Social Security , a landmark compromise that died ( before being announced ) when the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke .
`` Each president defined these deals as success , as principled compromises , '' Keith Hennessey , Mr. Bush 's chief domestic policy adviser , noted recently , `` and both parties shared the credit . ''
Not so the stopgap bill signed Tuesday by President Obama to avert the fiscal cliff and spare most taxpayers from paying income taxes at a higher rate . It left Republicans despondent , Democrats not quite thrilled , and represented Mr. Obama 's latest failure to achieve a major bipartisan agreement . It fell short , he said , of `` my preference '' for `` a larger agreement , a bigger deal , a grand bargain . ''
For that , Mr. Obama has mainly himself to blame . He faults congressional Republicans for his inability to achieve the impressive compromises that other presidents attained . But the biggest hindrance to a bipartisan breakthrough has been the president 's own style in dealing with the GOP opposition .
Unlike prior presidents , Mr. Obama does n't believe he is obligated personally to bring about a compromise . Over the past 18 months , he hosted meetings with Republican leaders and had numerous one-on-one conversations with House Speaker John Boehner —all for naught . Much of the serious negotiating is left to subordinates . He skipped the final talks on the fiscal-cliff deal , only to appear on television to inform `` members of both parties '' in Congress that he and the American people were anxiously awaiting a last-minute accord—as if he were as uninvolved in the budget wrangling as the public .
After the 2010 election , Vice President Joe Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell worked out a deal on taxes and spending . In 2011 , Mr. Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid picked up the pieces after a debt-limit compromise sought by Mr. Obama failed to materialize . This week , it was Messrs. Biden and McConnell again who were called on to produce an agreement .
The president devoted weeks to unproductive talks with Mr. Boehner and Republican leaders in 2011 over a $ 4 trillion grand bargain on taxes and spending . `` He views it that if he has extensive debate then he 'd fulfilled his only obligation , '' a Republican engaged in the talks said . `` Every day we got further away from a deal . '' Nonetheless , Mr. Obama boasted of having devoted more time than any previous president to such discussions .

Mr. Barnes , executive editor of the Weekly Standard , is a Fox News commentator .","President George W. Bush made bipartisan deals with Democrats on education, energy and, shortly before leaving office, the bank bailout known as TARP. President Reagan got together with Democrats on tax reform and Social Security. President Clinton reached agreement with Republicans on welfare reform, balancing the budget and Nafta's free trade. Mr. Clinton also negotiated reform of Social Security, a landmark compromise that died (before being announced) when the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke.

""Each president defined these deals as success, as principled compromises,"" Keith Hennessey, Mr. Bush's chief domestic policy adviser, noted recently, ""and both parties shared the credit.""

Not so the stopgap bill signed Tuesday by President Obama to avert the fiscal cliff and spare most taxpayers from paying income taxes at a higher rate. It left Republicans despondent, Democrats not quite thrilled, and represented Mr. Obama's latest failure to achieve a major bipartisan agreement. It fell short, he said, of ""my preference"" for ""a larger agreement, a bigger deal, a grand bargain.""

Indeed, it fell way, way short.

For that, Mr. Obama has mainly himself to blame. He faults congressional Republicans for his inability to achieve the impressive compromises that other presidents attained. But the biggest hindrance to a bipartisan breakthrough has been the president's own style in dealing with the GOP opposition.

U.S. President Barack Obama ZumaPress

Unlike prior presidents, Mr. Obama doesn't believe he is obligated personally to bring about a compromise. Over the past 18 months, he hosted meetings with Republican leaders and had numerous one-on-one conversations with House Speaker John Boehner —all for naught. Much of the serious negotiating is left to subordinates. He skipped the final talks on the fiscal-cliff deal, only to appear on television to inform ""members of both parties"" in Congress that he and the American people were anxiously awaiting a last-minute accord—as if he were as uninvolved in the budget wrangling as the public.

After the 2010 election, Vice President Joe Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell worked out a deal on taxes and spending. In 2011, Mr. Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid picked up the pieces after a debt-limit compromise sought by Mr. Obama failed to materialize. This week, it was Messrs. Biden and McConnell again who were called on to produce an agreement.

The president devoted weeks to unproductive talks with Mr. Boehner and Republican leaders in 2011 over a $4 trillion grand bargain on taxes and spending. ""He views it that if he has extensive debate then he'd fulfilled his only obligation,"" a Republican engaged in the talks said. ""Every day we got further away from a deal."" Nonetheless, Mr. Obama boasted of having devoted more time than any previous president to such discussions.

An even bigger impediment is the president's predilection for stepping up his demands just as a compromise appears possible. After Mr. Boehner agreed to $800 billion in new tax revenues in 2011, Mr. Obama suddenly called for $400 billion more. This instantly killed a potential grand bargain and deepened Republican distrust of the president.

This is a bigger problem than Mr. Obama may imagine. The most important issues—the debt ceiling, entitlement reform, tax reform, government spending, the $110 billion sequester—now must be dealt with in an atmosphere that is hardly conducive to bipartisanship and compromise.

The essence of bipartisan deals is win-win: Both sides are satisfied, even if not elated. Mr. Obama's approach is that he alone gets to win. The approach worked, more or less, on the fiscal-cliff deal, but it won't produce the larger bipartisan agreements that Mr. Obama now needs. And he'll miss the opportunities that other presidents seized, to their own benefit and the country's.

By letting the House take up the Senate 's fiscal cliff-dodging legislation that raises income tax rates on the wealthiest earners , Speaker John Boehner answered affirmatively a question that had been on many minds : Would he allow an up-or-down floor vote on a bill opposed by most fellow House Republicans ?
Until the New Year 's Day vote , Boehner had generally operated the House under what was known as the Hastert Rule . Named for former Speaker Dennis Hastert , it required a `` majority of the majority '' to support legislation before the speaker approved a floor vote .
But in the case of the fiscal cliff legislation passed by the House in a 257-167 vote , the majority of the majority opposed the bill , in large part because it lacked the significant spending cuts they desired .
Its 151 House GOP opponents even included members of Boehner 's leadership team — Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia and Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy of California .

`` On one of the most important House votes of the year , the minority ruled . The Hastert Rule ( go forward only with the support of a majority of the majority party ) has been displaced ( at least for now ) by the Boehner Rule ( sometimes a majority of the majority has to be rolled for the sake of the party 's reputation ) .

Of course , this assumes that Boehner gets to retain his speakership in the new 113th Congress , which is sworn in Thursday .
There is plenty of conservative outrage — including accusations that Boehner does n't represent them — and renewed calls for his ouster as speaker .
But you can find plenty of people , including Republican House members , who think Boehner will keep the speaker 's gavel in the new Congress .
Speaking on C-SPAN Wednesday morning , Rep. Mick Mulvaney , a conservative Republican from South Carolina , said :
`` I do n't think you 'll see a change in the speakership .

The president and the speaker met Sunday afternoon at the White House for the first time in weeks. It came after Boehner publicly chided Obama on Friday for the lack of progress to date, accusing the president of having ""wasted another week.""

Both sides were tightlipped about the surprise Sunday afternoon meeting. But instead of emerging from the talks complaining about each other, as was the case following phone calls last week, each side released an identical statement.

""This afternoon, the President and Speaker Boehner met at the White House to discuss efforts to resolve the fiscal cliff. We're not reading out details of the conversation, but the lines of communication remain open,"" the statement released by each office said.

Lawmakers and the White House have three weeks to reach a deal, before a potentially crippling set of tax hikes and spending cuts takes effect.

More On This...

Boehner last week put a counter-proposal on the table that included $800 billion in revenue increases over the next decade. While Boehner cast that as a significant concession, Obama said it didn't go far enough because it didn't include an increase in tax rates for the top 2 percent.

Boehner, though, is facing some pressure from Republicans to give a little bit more.

The speaker is effectively caught between two competing wings of the Republican Party. Some say Congress should not raise any taxes, and were disappointed he went so far as to put any revenue on the table. However, a growing number of Republicans are suggesting the party should give Obama what he wants on tax rates -- and focus instead on winning entitlement cuts once that is cleared away.

Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., became the latest Republican to open the door to tax rate hikes during an interview on ""Fox News Sunday.""

""There is a growing group of folks that are looking at this and realizing that we don't have a lot of cards as it relates to the tax issue, before year-end. I mean, we have one house, that's it,"" Corker said.

As far as the fiscal cliff negotiations go, Lott made it clear he believes fellow Republicans eventually will give in to President Barack Obama on raising tax rates for the wealthy, at least a little bit. But he said the timing -- when to do that -- is crucial politically.

House Speaker John Boehner and other conservatives reject his idea
Cole says major issues should be worked out in the debate next year
House Speaker John Boehner and other conservatives shot down a proposal from a senior congressional Republican who suggested that his GOP colleagues break from their firm anti-tax position and agree to a demand from Democrats to immediately renew middle-class tax cuts .
Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma , a member of the leadership team that helps round up House votes , told fellow GOP lawmakers that he thought they should , as a matter of political strategy , extend just the tax-rate cuts for those making $ 250,000 or less before the end of the year -- a position being pushed by President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats .
Cole first floated the idea at a closed-door meeting of the Republican whip team on Tuesday and his comments were first reported by Politico .
Cole told reporters after another meeting on Wednesday with House Republicans that he believed giving certainty to the majority of American taxpayers now was important . But he emphasized that he still opposed increasing tax rates for upper-income Americans .

House Speaker John Boehner and other conservatives reject his idea

Cole says major issues should be worked out in the debate next year

House Speaker John Boehner and other conservatives shot down a proposal from a senior congressional Republican who suggested that his GOP colleagues break from their firm anti-tax position and agree to a demand from Democrats to immediately renew middle-class tax cuts.

Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a member of the leadership team that helps round up House votes, told fellow GOP lawmakers that he thought they should, as a matter of political strategy, extend just the tax-rate cuts for those making $250,000 or less before the end of the year -- a position being pushed by President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats.

Cole first floated the idea at a closed-door meeting of the Republican whip team on Tuesday and his comments were first reported by Politico.

Cole told reporters after another meeting on Wednesday with House Republicans that he believed giving certainty to the majority of American taxpayers now was important. But he emphasized that he still opposed increasing tax rates for upper-income Americans.

ANALYSIS/OPINION:

Barack Obama ain’t afraid of no stinkin’ fiscal cliff. Why should he be? When the rest of us go over the cliff, doomed to pain and oblivion among the soup cans, plastic bags and empty soda-pop bottles at the bottom of the abyss, he’ll be soaring over the rooftops as only a tin-pot messiah can.

When the George W. Bush tax cuts expire at midnight on New Year’s Eve, with the rest of us singing a tearful adieu to Auld Lang Syne, the president will be popping corks. He’ll have his higher taxes. The joke will be on us, but nobody at the bottom of the cliff will be laughing.

Barack Obama’s goal is to raise taxes, and how he does that is of small consequence. He is determined not to cut spending. This has become clear enough to all. He will have redeemed FDR’s famous mantra — “Tax and tax, spend and spend, elect and elect” — in a way that Mr. Roosevelt could never have imagined. Mitt Romney’s infamous “47 percent,” the Americans who get a monthly government check, will balloon toward 100 percent. Cuts, reforms, restraints, disciplines of any kind will be silly notions of the past. Dependency will be enthroned.

Once this is understood, there’s no mystery about why the “negotiations” between the Democrats and the Republicans have never amounted to very much. Mr. Obama reads the Nov. 6 election result as a landslide, though 51 percent to 47 percent is far from a landslide. Nevertheless he is bold, and acting as if it were. He, and even a lot of timid and fearful Republicans, never absorbed the home truth that nothing recedes like success.

For now, everything is going the president’s way. Mr. Obama’s vision of America is one he learned in his community-organizing days. Americans have to give up the idea that America is, in Lincoln’s memorable formulation, the exceptional nation, and learn to be miserable in solidarity with both Upper and Lower Slobbovia.

The president’s intelligence chiefs have given him the “good news” that by the year 2030, only 18 years from now, the United States will no longer be the world’s great superpower. “In terms of the indices of overall power — Gross Domestic Product (GDP), population size, military spending and technological investment — Asia will surpass North America and Europe combined,” reports the National Intelligence Council of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. That mouthful of titles and capital letters comprise the president’s own intelligence gurus.

“With rapid rise of other countries,” the report goes on, “the ‘unipolar moment’ is over and no country — whether the U.S., China or any other country — will be a hegemonic power. The United States’ relative economic decline vis-a-vis the rising states is inevitable. … “

These are only opinions, of course, but the intelligence agencies are occasionally correct in their estimates and appraisals. But there is in the assessment a noticeable whiff of barely suppressed glee, and a suggestion that this could be the good news the president has been waiting for. Mr. Obama, a happy native of Hawaii, is nevertheless a man of the Third World attitudes and sensibilities inherited by birth, nurtured when he grew up in Indonesia, and it’s just these sensibilities that endear him to sordid allies on the left who dream of a world liberated from American example and influence.

Preaching the angry exploitation of the “rich,” as he defines “rich,” comes naturally to him and the Democratic left. Envy and covetousness are powerful emotions, easily manipulated, and Mr. Obama is a master of manipulation. Demonizing a neighbor in a bigger house who drives a new car is easy work. A new Battleground Poll finds that 60 percent of Americans polled now think raising taxes on households — not individuals but households — making more than $250,000 a year is a good idea. The president has done a splendid job of portraying these taxpayers as big-bellied plutocrats who summer in France, winter in St. Moritz and dine on roast swan.

But nearly 70 percent in the Battleground Poll think raising taxes on small businesses earning more than $250,000 is a bad idea. Republicans have done a lousy job of explaining that many, perhaps most, of the “rich” Americans and these small businesses are one and the same. That’s why abusing small businesses is likely to send the country reeling into another recession at the bottom of the cliff. This one won’t be George W.’s fault.

fiscal_cliff,Fox Online News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/01/03/boehner-could-face-rocky-vote-for-speakership-amid-republican-angst/,Boehner could face rocky vote for speakership amid Republican angst ,2013-01-03,,"John Boehner could be in for a fight Thursday when the newly seated House votes for the next speaker , with conservatives grumbling about his leadership and a report surfacing about a supposed plan to challenge him .
The 11-term congressman , who 's endured his share of political turbulence , presumably enters the election with the upper hand . So far , a single viable Republican challenger has not emerged and the rules of the vote tend to work in Boehner 's favor .
But Boehner 's potential troubles were compounded by a late-night flare up with outraged Northeast lawmakers over a decision by the speaker to postpone a vote on an aid package for Superstorm Sandy victims .
For the near term , the speaker appears to have weathered those complaints , assuring members in a closed-door meeting Wednesday afternoon they will vote by Jan. 15 . Rep. Michael Grimm , R-N.Y. , who initially described the postponement as a `` betrayal '' and threatened to abstain from voting for Boehner , said after the meeting he would back Boehner .
Rep. Peter King , R-N.Y. , who earlier lashed out at the GOP leadership in a string of interviews and remarks , said the same .
But a spate of other flare-ups over the past several days and weeks among House Republicans has stoked threats about resistance -- or at least some drama -- Thursday . Conservatives were already miffed that Boehner , early on in talks over the fiscal crisis , had agreed to new revenue . Boehner suffered another blow two weeks ago when his `` Plan B '' fiscal bill failed to garner enough Republican backers . But the final fiscal-crisis bill , which arrived from the Senate early Tuesday morning , ultimately garnered thin support from the GOP ranks . While Boehner and 84 other Republicans voted for it , 151 Republicans opposed it -- more Democrats than Republicans voted for the bill .
Amid the angst , a draft plan was supposedly circulating on Capitol Hill laying out a possible path for challenging Boehner . Ron Meyer , press secretary for the anti-Boehner group American Majority Action , told FoxNews.com that the document is legitimate , though he was n't sure who started circulating it .
A copy of the supposed plan posted by Breitbart.com lays out a two-stage process for challenging Boehner . First , it calls for somebody coming forward to urge a vote by secret ballot -- which would allow members to vote without fear of retaliation . Then , the document suggests , challengers could emerge .
The process for the vote is a bit complicated . For the time being , the only candidates for nomination would be Boehner and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi .
The only way for someone to win the speakership is to win a majority ( more than 50 percent ) of all votes cast . If everybody votes , that means the winner must ultimately attract 218 votes .

The 11-term congressman, who's endured his share of political turbulence, presumably enters the election with the upper hand. So far, a single viable Republican challenger has not emerged and the rules of the vote tend to work in Boehner's favor.

But Boehner's potential troubles were compounded by a late-night flare up with outraged Northeast lawmakers over a decision by the speaker to postpone a vote on an aid package for Superstorm Sandy victims.

For the near term, the speaker appears to have weathered those complaints, assuring members in a closed-door meeting Wednesday afternoon they will vote by Jan. 15. Rep. Michael Grimm, R-N.Y., who initially described the postponement as a ""betrayal"" and threatened to abstain from voting for Boehner, said after the meeting he would back Boehner.

Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who earlier lashed out at the GOP leadership in a string of interviews and remarks, said the same.

But a spate of other flare-ups over the past several days and weeks among House Republicans has stoked threats about resistance -- or at least some drama -- Thursday. Conservatives were already miffed that Boehner, early on in talks over the fiscal crisis, had agreed to new revenue. Boehner suffered another blow two weeks ago when his ""Plan B"" fiscal bill failed to garner enough Republican backers. But the final fiscal-crisis bill, which arrived from the Senate early Tuesday morning, ultimately garnered thin support from the GOP ranks. While Boehner and 84 other Republicans voted for it, 151 Republicans opposed it -- more Democrats than Republicans voted for the bill.

Amid the angst, a draft plan was supposedly circulating on Capitol Hill laying out a possible path for challenging Boehner. Ron Meyer, press secretary for the anti-Boehner group American Majority Action, told FoxNews.com that the document is legitimate, though he wasn't sure who started circulating it.

""I've talked to members who've seen it,"" he said.

A copy of the supposed plan posted by Breitbart.com lays out a two-stage process for challenging Boehner. First, it calls for somebody coming forward to urge a vote by secret ballot -- which would allow members to vote without fear of retaliation. Then, the document suggests, challengers could emerge.

The process for the vote is a bit complicated. For the time being, the only candidates for nomination would be Boehner and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi.

The only way for someone to win the speakership is to win a majority (more than 50 percent) of all votes cast. If everybody votes, that means the winner must ultimately attract 218 votes. There are 234 Republicans in the new Congress, but if Boehner loses 17 of them, it's enough to kick the vote to a second ballot -- something that hasn't happened since 1923.

Pelosi could conceivably win the speakership, but only if Republicans cross over to vote for her or if enough Republicans actually abstain from voting. More likely, if there are enough defections, is that the vote would move into multiple rounds of ballots, with anti-Boehner conservative members basically trying to drum up a viable Republican challenger to Boehner on the spot.

Some on Capitol Hill, in both parties, were stoking the idea Wednesday that there was a rift emerging in the GOP leadership.

King claimed that Boehner and House Republican Leader Eric Cantor, who opposed the fiscal package Tuesday, were not on speaking terms. He said Cantor, who apparently had been pushing for a vote on the Sandy aid bill, did not find out about Boehner's decision to scratch it until Boehner's staff informed Republican lawmakers, who then told Cantor.

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also repeatedly referenced ""palace intrigue"" among the House GOP leadership, during a press conference Wednesday blasting Boehner over the Sandy bill delay.

Cantor's office voiced support for Boehner in a statement to Fox News.

""They remain in contact and have meetings together today. The majority leader supports the speaker,"" Cantor's office said in a statement.

The path toward the fast-approaching fiscal cliff

The possibility of a fiscal cliff -- which economists warn will hit the American economy hard -- was set in motion two years ago, as a way to force action on mounting government debt. Negotiations between top Congressional Republicans and Democrats resumed after Obama's re-election last month as did the barbs from both sides.

Polling has consistently shown most Americans back the president, who insists wealthy Americans must pay more, rather than Boehner and his Republican colleagues, who have balked at tax rate hikes and demanded spending cuts and entitlement program reforms.

A new CNN/ORC International survey released Thursday showed that just over half of respondents believe Republicans should give up more in any solution and consider the party's policies too extreme.

The two sides seemingly had made progress on forging a $2 trillion deficit reduction deal that included new revenue sought by Obama and spending cuts and entitlement changes desired by Boehner.

As the nation approaches the so-called `` fiscal cliff , '' people are taking steps to cushion their families from the plunge .
`` We need to go over the cliff , '' says Valerie Stayskal , 58-year-old owner of two small businesses in Addison , Illinois .
As Congress and the White House battle over the $ 7 trillion worth of tax increases and spending cuts that could start to take effect in January , CNN reached out to people in various walks of life to find out how they 're already being affected .
`` The fiscal cliff is just one more thing that makes us wait , feel unsure , '' says Cleave , 61 , who is also a wilderness ranger in Salt Lake City . She shared her perspective recently with CNN iReport .
The economic collapse of 2008 left a lot of people `` stuck , '' she says .
She was `` stuck '' trying to sell her house , then felt `` unstuck a bit '' when Obama was first elected `` because we hoped he could change things . '' But things did n't change enough . `` We felt unstuck again this election , '' because the country seemed to send a resounding message about the kind of economic action it wants , including raising taxes on the wealthiest , she said .
`` But now we feel stuck again '' because there 's no sign of a compromise . `` It means we freeze , we do n't buy as much , we save , we wait . ''
Cleave 's family is Buddhist , `` so we meditate on living with the feeling of uncertainty , '' she says . `` It 's part of life . But I think many people are in waiting and saving mode because they feel confused about how this will all play out . ''
Lela Ladd is one of them . Her family in McCook , Nebraska , is `` living frugally , anticipating future tax increases , '' she says .
`` My husband and I are not exchanging Christmas gifts . In the past , we spent about $ 500 on each other . ''
The couple has three children and eight grandchildren -- each of whom will receive only one gift each from them this year
That frugality was already spurred by the hard times of the last several years , but the `` cliff '' is adding to that stress .
`` It is hard not to be angry at our elected officials , '' says Ladd , 57 , a self-employed insurance agent . `` They have forgotten why we elected them : to watch out for our country . They really do n't know what it is like to walk in our shoes . You have to be rich to be elected to anything anymore , so the working class is no longer represented . ''
Surveys show most Americans want compromise on Capitol Hill . A Gallup Poll found 62 % want Democrats and Republicans to reach a deal .
But many doubt it will happen . A Washington Post/Pew Research Center poll found 49 % of Americans do not expect an agreement by the end of the year , while 40 % do .

It 's too soon to know whether the cliff fears are having a Grinch-like impact , and sales so far have hit new highs . But the federation is concerned about the weeks ahead .
`` Before Thanksgiving , the threat of the fiscal cliff seemed remote to most Americans , '' says David French , the NRF 's top lobbyist , who is pushing both parties for action on the issue . `` Now , more and more people are focused on it , and the threat is becoming more real ...

Government-style accounting would put a business 'in jail , ' owner says
Owners of two small businesses in New Jersey told CNN they 're nervous and frustrated .
Any business that followed the same `` method of accounting as our government '' would `` be in jail , '' complains Bob Bellagamba , CEO of Concorde Worldwide , a limousine company .
He wants a decision on the fiscal cliff `` so I know how to run my business . '' Depending on the outcome , he may have to lay off some employees , he said .
Charles Altiero , owner of Freehold Jewelers , said tax increases might help him in one way . `` More people are going to have to sell their gold to pay their taxes . ''
But it would hurt his customers ' buying power . So , he said , he 's open to the idea of paying more taxes to help avoid going off the `` cliff . ''

`` We normally present our biggest customers with appreciation gifts . This year everyone gets a card , '' said Mary Hall , who owns the business with her husband .

No programs have been cut yet due to the fiscal cliff , but `` as the federal government starts cutting and limiting spending , the states tend to tighten their belts as well , '' she said .

Now , he 's changing his mind . `` I will not go back into the work force if taxes are to go up on the middle class , '' he says . So much of the money he would make would go to taxes that it would n't be worth working . `` These tax increases would take away from our income drastically . ''

Brian Chandler , a 34-year-old in Marietta , Georgia , says he 's among those Americans with incomes over $ 250,000 whose taxes would go up under Obama 's plan .
`` I am technically considered 'rich , ' '' says Chandler . `` I did this through hard work , long hours , taking on work that clearly was n't my responsibility , networking , etc . Now it sort of feels like I 'm being penalized for that , in higher taxes , because of others ' lack of financial responsibility . ''

House Republicans are launching a parallel strategy to avert the fiscal cliff , seeking to pass a bill that would hike tax rates on income over $ 1 million , while extending rates on the rest of Americans .
Unveiled by Speaker John Boehner ( R-Ohio ) at a closed party meeting Tuesday , the legislation has already been declared dead on arrival by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D-Nev. ) and the White House , who argue it ’ s still weighted too heavily in favor of the wealthy . House Democrats would not help Boehner cull together the 218 votes he needs to get the bill passed , the No . 2 House Democrat , Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer , said .
The vote , expected to happen this week , is designed to provide cover for House Republicans if the nation goes off the fiscal cliff and income tax rates jump on everyone . If President Barack Obama keeps accusing Republicans of only looking out for the wealthiest , the backup plan allows them to respond it ’ s not true .
Though talks between Obama and Boehner the last several days have yielded clear progress , there ’ s a long way to go . It remains to be seen whether the GOP fallback plan will jump-start negotiations again .
Boehner informed Obama about his Plan B in a phone call Monday night . That prompted Obama to tell Reid and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( D-Calif. ) that talks between the White House and Boehner were stalled . White House aides Rob Nabors and Gene Sperling came to Capitol Hill Tuesday to address both the Senate and House Democratic caucuses .
In 13 days , taxes go up on everyone . Shortly after , tens of billions of dollars in spending cuts for the Pentagon and other federal agencies kick in . That Boehner is putting his own bill on the floor shows that his talks with Obama have reached at least a temporary impasse .

House Republicans are launching a parallel strategy to avert the fiscal cliff, seeking to pass a bill that would hike tax rates on income over $1 million, while extending rates on the rest of Americans.

Unveiled by Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) at a closed party meeting Tuesday, the legislation has already been declared dead on arrival by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and the White House, who argue it’s still weighted too heavily in favor of the wealthy. House Democrats would not help Boehner cull together the 218 votes he needs to get the bill passed, the No. 2 House Democrat, Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer, said.

The vote, expected to happen this week, is designed to provide cover for House Republicans if the nation goes off the fiscal cliff and income tax rates jump on everyone. If President Barack Obama keeps accusing Republicans of only looking out for the wealthiest, the backup plan allows them to respond it’s not true.

Though talks between Obama and Boehner the last several days have yielded clear progress, there’s a long way to go. It remains to be seen whether the GOP fallback plan will jump-start negotiations again.

Boehner informed Obama about his Plan B in a phone call Monday night. That prompted Obama to tell Reid and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) that talks between the White House and Boehner were stalled. White House aides Rob Nabors and Gene Sperling came to Capitol Hill Tuesday to address both the Senate and House Democratic caucuses.

In 13 days, taxes go up on everyone. Shortly after, tens of billions of dollars in spending cuts for the Pentagon and other federal agencies kick in. That Boehner is putting his own bill on the floor shows that his talks with Obama have reached at least a temporary impasse.
