USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump says he likes all of his potential Supreme Court nominees.

Aides and advisers say he likes them for different reasons.

As Trump approaches Monday's announcement of his nominee to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy, aides and advisers say the president is weighing different factors for different candidates.

Perhaps the biggest factor: The degree of difficulty for Senate confirmation.

""He needs to produce a nominee who is hard to criticize on objective grounds,"" says David Lat, founder of the legal website Above The Law, who is in contact with officials involved in the process.

Here's a scorecard of pluses and minuses for the people on the president's short list:

Brett Kavanaugh of Maryland, 53, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit

Pluses: Like Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch, named to the high court by Trump last year, he is out of conservative central casting. A Yale Law graduate to Gorsuch's Harvard, they served together as law clerks to retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy. Whip-smart and popular with the Federalist Society set, he has a long record of opinions and dissents that leaves little for Trump or Senate Republicans to worry about.

Minuses: That long record will give opponents much to work with. His mild dissent in a case upholding the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate left room for conservatives as well as liberals to disagree. His contention that presidents should be free from lawsuits and investigations likely pleases Trump but will confound Democrats. His work in the George W. Bush administration also could come back to haunt him.

Amy Coney Barrett of Indiana, 46, U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit

Pluses: She rocketed to the top of Trump's list with a stellar performance during her confirmation last fall, when Democrats cited her deep Catholic faith as a potential problem. The mother of seven children, including two from Haiti and one with special needs, she offers the imagery Trump craves. Being a woman may box in Democrats. Being from Indiana may box in moderate Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly, who faces a tough re-election campaign. Being the youngest on Trump's list buys more years on the court. And degrees from Notre Dame, where she taught for two decades, can't hurt.

Minuses: She has served as a judge for just eight months, which gives her the least experience of any of the potential nominees. She has written that Supreme Court precedents are not sacrosanct, which liberals have interpreted as a threat to the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide.

Raymond Kethledge of Michigan, 51, U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit

Pluses: His strong adherence to textualism and originalism, the twin tenets that drove the late Justice Antonin Scalia, pleases conservatives. A finalist for the job last year, he emerged with Kavanaugh as a leading contender for the next opening. Like Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, he is a former Kennedy law clerk. He's known for his attention to detail in writing, which he often does from a remote, Internet-free cabin.

Minuses: Despite a decade on the appeals court, his record is thin in several areas of the law, which worries some conservatives. Though major cases on Obamacare and same-sex marriage came through his circuit, he did not serve on the panels considering them. His 2016 ruling that cellphone users do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their location records was overturned at the Supreme Court this term.

Amul Thapar of Kentucky, 49, U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit

Pluses: After Gorsuch, he was Trump's first federal court nominee last year. His guardian angel in the Senate is Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a fellow Kentuckian. He would be the first Indian American on the court, and among few in history to have trial experience on a district court. Nevertheless, he often was designated to sit on appellate court panels, giving him needed experience. He is a strong writer.

Minuses: He has served on the appeals court for little more than a year and has yet to rule on most controversial topics, giving conservatives little proof of his convictions.

Thomas Hardiman of Pennsylvania, 52, U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit

Pluses: He was the runner-up to Gorsuch in 2017, giving him instant credibility. He's a law-and-order conservative in the mold of Associate Justice Samuel Alito, who came from the same appeals court. Maryanne Trump Barry, the president's sister, served with him until her retirement. He drove a taxi to get through law school, and his degrees from Notre Dame and Georgetown give him a non-Ivy League appeal.

Minuses: His star appears to be fading. A limited paper trail on the appeals court worries some conservatives.

In a 6-3 ruling , the justices determined that a law prohibiting registration of `` immoral or scandalous '' trademark names violates the First Amendment .
The case , Iancu v. Brunetti , pitted a clothing manufacturer of the aforementioned brand name `` FUCT '' against the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ( PTO ) , which refused to accept the trademark registration because of its vulgar nature . Erik Brunetti fought the decision , and today the justices ruled in his favor .
The majority decision , written by Justice Elena Kagan and joined by Justices Clarence Thomas , Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Neil Gorsuch , and Brett Kavanaugh , ruled that this part of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional because it discriminates on the basis of viewpoint . This ruling builds on a decision from 2017 , Matal v. Tam , in which the Supreme Court ruled for similar reasons that the PTO could n't reject the trademark for the band name The Slants as being offensive or disparaging .
The Tam ruling is invoked and quoted extensively in this ruling . Here 's Kagan :
So the Lanham Act allows registration of marks when their messages accord with , but not when their messages defy , society 's sense of decency or propriety .

The statute favors the former , and disfavors the latter . `` Love rules '' ? `` Always be good '' ? Registration follows . `` Hate rules '' ? `` Always be cruel '' ?

Kagan further explains that under the court 's interpretation of the Lanham Act , the PTO regularly rejects trademarks that appear to promote drug use— '' Marijuana Cola , '' `` Ko Kane , '' and `` Bong Hits 4 Jesus '' —and accepts trademarks that condemn drug use . That 's not a viewpoint-neutral position on what is immoral or scandalous , she concludes . And therefore , it 's in violation of the First Amendment .
Justice Samuel Alito concurred but wanted to add to his concerns here about the current pressures to discriminate on the basis of viewpoint in the United States and elsewhere :
Viewpoint discrimination is poison to a free society . But in many countries with constitutions or legal traditions that claim to protect freedom of speech , serious viewpoint discrimination is now tolerated , and such discrimination has become increasingly prevalent in this country . At a time when free speech is under attack , it is especially important for this Court to remain firm on the principle that the First Amendment does not tolerate viewpoint discrimination . We reaffirm that principle today .
Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor put out a trio of opinions that dissented in part but also concurred in part . In Robert 's dissent , he argues that he believes the definition of `` scandalous '' could be narrowed to bar trademarks that are `` obscene , vulgar , or profane '' without striking that part of the law down entirely . Breyer wrote that he did not see how a statute prohibiting the trademarking of brands with obscene or vulgar words would be viewpoint discrimination . And Sotomayor worried that the broadness of the majority ruling means `` the Government will have no statutory basis to refuse ( and thus no choice but to begin ) registering marks containing the most vulgar , profane , or obscene words and images imaginable .

What's something you think is a good idea but you think is unconstitutional? Or, conversely, what's something you think is a bad idea but you think is constitutional?

Everyone concerned with the Constitution — and most especially Supreme Court nominees — should be asked this question. And if they don’t have an answer — that is, if they think everything they like is constitutional — then maybe they don't really believe in the Constitution.

In many ways, this question defines modern debates over the Supreme Court, and, supposing whoever President Obama nominates makes it to the Senate Judiciary Committee, it will also define the debate over the late Justice Antonin Scalia's replacement.

The question is crucial because it helps delineate the difference between a judge and a legislator, at least in theory. Legislators get to always vote their preferences; judges, however, don't.

For most people, Supreme Court opinions such as last June's Obergefell v.

Not like it? Bad decision. Consequently, most people's estimation of our justices mirrors that assessment: Did they vote for legalizing same-sex marriage? Good justice. Against it? Bad justice.

To Justice Scalia, as well as many of his fellow conservatives on the bench, to be a judge was to strive to eliminate his policy preferences from his decision making as much as possible.

President Trump nominated Judge Kavanaugh in July and the National Archives has been processing hundreds of thousands of pages of documents from his time in the 1990s working for the independent counsel investigating the Clintons and his time in the Bush White House .
Democrats , though , say there are millions of pages of documents still left in the archives from the judge ’ s time in the Bush White House that haven ’ t been requested .
Roughly an hour into the hearing , Democrats were still demanding a vote to adjourn the hearing , preventing the lawmakers and Judge Kavanaugh from making opening statements .
In total , Democrats interrupted the hearing more than 44 times during the first hour .
Sen. Thom Tillis , North Carolina Republican , suggested the interruptions by Democrats had been preplanned over the weekend during a conference with their party ’ s leadership .
“ There was a phone conference yesterday , ” admitted Sen. Richard Durbin , Illinois Democrat , saying they discussed many issues during the call .
“ One of the issues was that over 100,000 documents related to Judge Kavanaugh have been characterize by the chairman of the committee as committee confidential , ” he said .
Republican Sen. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah said some Democrats on the committee are opposing Judge Kavanaugh because they ’ re running for president in 2020 and playing up to liberal interest groups .
“ We have folks who want to run for president , who want their moment in the spotlight , who want that coveted TV clip , ” Mr. Hatch said . “ Frankly , I wish we could drop all the nonsense . ”
Mr. Hatch added , “ Unfortunately , we have all these interest groups screaming from the sidelines and putting pressure on my Democratic colleagues to make this hearing about politics , to make it pretty much about anything except Judge Kavanaugh and his qualifications . ”
When a protester tried to shout down Mr. Hatch ’ s opening statement , the lawmaker commented , “ I think we ought to have this loudmouth removed . We shouldn ’ t have to put up with this kind of stuff . I hope she ’ s not a law student . ”
Moments later , more protesters shouted over Mr. Hatch even louder .
“ Mr . Chairman , I don ’ t know that the committee should have to put up with this type of insolence that ’ s going on in this room today , ” Mr. Hatch told Mr. Grassley .

President Trump nominated Judge Kavanaugh in July and the National Archives has been processing hundreds of thousands of pages of documents from his time in the 1990s working for the independent counsel investigating the Clintons and his time in the Bush White House.

Democrats, though, say there are millions of pages of documents still left in the archives from the judge’s time in the Bush White House that haven’t been requested.

Roughly an hour into the hearing, Democrats were still demanding a vote to adjourn the hearing, preventing the lawmakers and Judge Kavanaugh from making opening statements.

In total, Democrats interrupted the hearing more than 44 times during the first hour.

Mr. Grassley continued to deny their motion and demands.

Sen. Thom Tillis, North Carolina Republican, suggested the interruptions by Democrats had been preplanned over the weekend during a conference with their party’s leadership.

“There was a phone conference yesterday,” admitted Sen. Richard Durbin, Illinois Democrat, saying they discussed many issues during the call.

“One of the issues was that over 100,000 documents related to Judge Kavanaugh have been characterize by the chairman of the committee as committee confidential,” he said.

Republican Sen. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah said some Democrats on the committee are opposing Judge Kavanaugh because they’re running for president in 2020 and playing up to liberal interest groups.

“We have folks who want to run for president, who want their moment in the spotlight, who want that coveted TV clip,” Mr. Hatch said. “Frankly, I wish we could drop all the nonsense.”

Mr. Hatch added, “Unfortunately, we have all these interest groups screaming from the sidelines and putting pressure on my Democratic colleagues to make this hearing about politics, to make it pretty much about anything except Judge Kavanaugh and his qualifications.”

When a protester tried to shout down Mr. Hatch’s opening statement, the lawmaker commented, “I think we ought to have this loudmouth removed. We shouldn’t have to put up with this kind of stuff. I hope she’s not a law student.”

Moments later, more protesters shouted over Mr. Hatch even louder.

“Mr. Chairman, I don’t know that the committee should have to put up with this type of insolence that’s going on in this room today,” Mr. Hatch told Mr. Grassley.

“These people are so out of line, they shouldn’t even be allowed in the doggone room.”

WASHINGTON – Supreme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was absent from oral arguments Monday while recovering from surgery for lung cancer, a first in her 25-year career on the court.

Ginsburg, 85, had surgery Dec. 21 to remove two cancerous growths from her left lung. She was released five days later and has been recovering at home.

Chief Justice John Roberts noted Ginsburg's absence briefly at the beginning of the session. He said the justice ""is unable to be present today but will participate"" in deciding the two cases being argued by reading legal briefs and transcripts of the oral arguments.

Ginsburg's absence was not unexpected and does not indicate her condition has worsened. But Ginsburg's ability to attend court after two previous bouts with cancer in 1999 and 2009, as well as the day after husband Martin's death in 2010, had court observers wondering if she would show up.

Ginsburg, the leader of the court's liberal faction, had a pulmonary lobectomy at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City less than three weeks ago. The growths were discovered during tests in November to diagnose and treat rib fractures suffered in a fall two months ago.

Both nodules removed during surgery were found to be malignant on initial pathology evaluation. After surgery, there was no evidence of any remaining disease in the lung or anywhere else in Ginsburg's body.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for both men and women in the USA, according to the National Cancer Institute. From 2009 to 2013, it caused more deaths than breast, prostate, colorectal and liver cancers combined. The five-year survival rate is just 18 percent but is far better if the cancer is discovered at an early stage.

Ginsburg, a cultural icon among liberals and proponents of women's rights, has been closely monitored by those on the left and right for her health. Conservatives have a 5-4 majority on the court, and future vacancies during President Donald Trump's watch could increase that margin. Republicans will have a 53-47 majority in the incoming Senate.

Ginsburg's lung cancer is the latest in a lengthy list of physical maladies from which she has recovered over the years. She had colon cancer 20 years ago and pancreatic cancer a decade ago. She received a stent in a heart procedure in 2014 and has been injured in previous falls. None of those incidents kept her off the bench.

In November, she fell in her office and went home. Experiencing discomfort overnight, she was driven to George Washington University Hospital, where she was found to have fractured three ribs on her left side.

Ginsburg was forced to miss the formal investiture ceremony for new Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh at the court that day. By nightfall, she was working in her hospital room.

In recent years, Ginsburg has worked out twice a week with a personal trainer in the Supreme Court's gym, to the beat of the PBS NewsHour. She wrote the first opinion issued by the court for the term that began in October, marking the third consecutive year she has done so.

Last year, Ginsburg said she intended to stay on the bench for at least five more years, noting that Associate Justice John Paul Stevens served until age 90. Stevens, 98, retired in 2010.

supreme_court,The Daily Caller,2,https://dailycaller.com/2020/01/27/public-charge-rule-supreme-court/,Supreme Court Allows Trump To Enforce Rule Barring Green Cards For Migrants Using Social Services,2020-01-27,,"The Supreme Court Monday allowed the Trump administration to enforce a new rule that will deny green cards to foreign nationals who use taxpayer-funded social services , lifting lower court injunctions that blocked the change .
The 5-4 vote followed familiar ideological lines , with Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Stephen Breyer , Sonia Sotomayor , and Elena Kagan in dissent . The justices did not give reasons for lifting the injunctions — as is typical of orders of this nature — though Justice Neil Gorsuch released a concurring opinion urging the Supreme Court to curtail the use nationwide injunctions , which Justice Clarence Thomas joined .
“ Today ’ s stay from the Supreme Court is a massive win for American taxpayers , American workers , and the American Constitution , ” White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said of the order . “ This decision allows the government to implement regulations effectuating longstanding federal law that newcomers to this country must be financially self-sufficient and not a ‘ public charge ’ on our country and its citizens . ”
The Immigration and Nationality Act ( INA ) dictates that foreign nationals should not receive green cards if they are “ likely at any time to become a public charge. ” At issue in Monday ’ s case is the definition of “ public charge. ” In recent years , the term was defined as a person primarily dependent on a cash assistance program .
The Trump administration promulgated a new rule in August 2019 that expands the definition to include those likely to use non-cash benefit programs like Medicaid , food stamps , or housing benefits for a period of months . The rule does not apply to humanitarian migrants like refugees or asylum-seekers .
“ Throughout our history , self-reliance has been a core principle in America , ” then-acting director of USCIS Ken Cuccinelli said of the new policy during a 2019 White House press conference . “ The virtues of perseverance , hard work , and self-sufficiency laid the foundation of our nation and have defined generations of immigrants seeking opportunity in the United States. ” ( RELATED : Clarence Thomas Pans Joe Biden , ’ 91 Confirmation Hearing In Forthcoming Documentary )
Immigrant-rights groups say the rule will have a discriminatory effect , and warn that it deters migrants lawfully in the United States from applying for needed social services .
“ Our members have stopped accepting or refused to apply for public benefits for themselves and their family members , including their children , because of fear that receiving any benefits will harm their ability to stay in the United States , ” said George Escobar of CASA , a D.C.-area immigration non-profit that is challenging the rule in court . “ This harms not just these families , who use these benefits to supplement their incomes and support their health , well-being , and stability , but also the broader community . ”
U.S. District Judge George Daniels issued a pair of nationwide injunctions against the rule after two separate plaintiffs — the city of New York , and a coalition of three states — brought lawsuits challenging the change . Daniels found that the administration did not give a reasonable explanation for its new definition , which is itself an unreasonable interpretation of the INA .
The 2nd U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that decision , prompting the government ’ s emergency application to the Supreme Court .
In legal filings at the Supreme Court , the plaintiffs warned that lifting the injunctions would abruptly upend settled immigration policy going back decades . They also predicted that confusion would follow such a change because the government has not provided sufficient guidance for administering the new policy . For example , the rule requires immigration officers to negatively weigh an alien ’ s low English proficiency , but the plaintiffs say there are no guidelines for how language skills should be assessed .
The administration countered that the injunctions force them to issue green cards to applicants who are not eligible for permanent legal status under the new rule . If the government ultimately prevails in court and gets to enforce the rule , they won ’ t be able to rescind green cards issued during litigation .
“ Respondents do not dispute that because of the nationwide preliminary injunctions , the government is presently awarding — on an effectively irrevocable basis — grants of lawful permanent resident status to aliens who , under the Rule , should instead be declared inadmissible , ” the Justice Department said in a court document .
In a separate opinion accompanying Monday ’ s order , Gorsuch said the high court should consider the propriety of nationwide injunctions in an appropriate case . The justice expressed concern that such injunctions hurl disputes into an emergency posture that requires quick resolution . In contrast , Gorsuch said the judicial process is meant to move slowly and methodically .
“ By their nature , universal injunctions tend to force judges into making rushed , high-stakes , low-information decisions , ” Gorsuch wrote .
“ The rise of nationwide injunctions may just be a sign of our impatient times , ” he added . “ But good judicial decisions are usually tempered by older virtues . ”
The Trump administration urged the court to address nationwide injunctions in its stay application . Such orders have beset the government since the president took office . Attorney General William Barr said such injunctions are inconsistent with the rule of law in a May address to the American Law Institute .

“Our members have stopped accepting or refused to apply for public benefits for themselves and their family members, including their children, because of fear that receiving any benefits will harm their ability to stay in the United States,” said George Escobar of CASA, a D.C.-area immigration non-profit that is challenging the rule in court. “This harms not just these families, who use these benefits to supplement their incomes and support their health, well-being, and stability, but also the broader community.”

U.S. District Judge George Daniels issued a pair of nationwide injunctions against the rule after two separate plaintiffs — the city of New York, and a coalition of three states — brought lawsuits challenging the change. Daniels found that the administration did not give a reasonable explanation for its new definition, which is itself an unreasonable interpretation of the INA.

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that decision, prompting the government’s emergency application to the Supreme Court.

In legal filings at the Supreme Court, the plaintiffs warned that lifting the injunctions would abruptly upend settled immigration policy going back decades. They also predicted that confusion would follow such a change because the government has not provided sufficient guidance for administering the new policy. For example, the rule requires immigration officers to negatively weigh an alien’s low English proficiency, but the plaintiffs say there are no guidelines for how language skills should be assessed.

The administration countered that the injunctions force them to issue green cards to applicants who are not eligible for permanent legal status under the new rule. If the government ultimately prevails in court and gets to enforce the rule, they won’t be able to rescind green cards issued during litigation.

“Respondents do not dispute that because of the nationwide preliminary injunctions, the government is presently awarding — on an effectively irrevocable basis — grants of lawful permanent resident status to aliens who, under the Rule, should instead be declared inadmissible,” the Justice Department said in a court document.

In a separate opinion accompanying Monday’s order, Gorsuch said the high court should consider the propriety of nationwide injunctions in an appropriate case. The justice expressed concern that such injunctions hurl disputes into an emergency posture that requires quick resolution. In contrast, Gorsuch said the judicial process is meant to move slowly and methodically.

“By their nature, universal injunctions tend to force judges into making rushed, high-stakes, low-information decisions,” Gorsuch wrote.

“The rise of nationwide injunctions may just be a sign of our impatient times,” he added. “But good judicial decisions are usually tempered by older virtues.”

The Trump administration urged the court to address nationwide injunctions in its stay application. Such orders have beset the government since the president took office. Attorney General William Barr said such injunctions are inconsistent with the rule of law in a May address to the American Law Institute.

The case is No. 19A785 Department of Homeland Security v. New York.

For his sympathizers , his fiery statements accusing liberals of a conspiracy to bring him down were an isolated defense against career-threatening allegations . Supporters argue that they have little bearing on how he would perform as a justice compared with his record and reputation from the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia . “ He ’ s always been fair and even-handed , and I would expect him to continue to do that if he were appointed to the Supreme Court , ” says Jennifer Mascott , a law professor who clerked for Kavanaugh and has known him throughout his 12 years on the D.C .

Still , in the eyes of many others – from friends and former colleagues to a former Supreme Court justice – his defense against the allegations crossed a line that no nominee for the high court should cross .

Brett Kavanaugh looks poised to become the newest justice on the United States Supreme Court on Saturday .
Senators spent the past two days taking turns in a room in a sub-basement on Capitol Hill to review the findings of an FBI investigation into multiple sexual assault allegations against Judge Kavanaugh . With Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine throwing her support behind Kavanaugh Friday afternoon , the most bitter and partisan confirmation fight of modern times looks like it will reach its conclusion with Saturday afternoon 's vote .
If confirmed , there are widespread concerns that the attacks Kavanaugh both received and delivered over the past month could resonate long into the future .
For his sympathizers , his fiery statements last week were an isolated and commensurate defense against career-threatening allegations .
Accusing Democratic senators on the committee of “ grotesque and coordinated character assassination , ” Kavanaugh described the allegations as “ a calculated and orchestrated political hit ” fueled by anger over President Trump ’ s election victory , “ revenge on behalf of the Clintons , and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups . ”
Supporters argue that these have little bearing on how he would perform as a justice compared with his record and reputation from the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia . Kavanaugh himself seemed to address concerns about his temperament and impartiality in an op-ed published in The Wall Street Journal Thursday evening , explaining that he was “ very emotional ” during the hearing and “ said a few things I should not have said . ”
“ He ’ s always been fair and even-handed , and I would expect him to continue to do that if he were appointed to the Supreme Court , ” says Jennifer Mascott , a former clerk for Kavanaugh who has known him throughout his 12 years on the D.C . Circuit and who teaches at George Mason University ’ s Antonin Scalia Law School . “ What was happening at the hearing was a very specific set of circumstances , allegations brought against him that necessitated a personal response and direct response . ”
Senator Collins did n't reference Kavanaugh 's partisan comments in her speech today . Still , in the eyes of many others – from friends and former colleagues to a former Supreme Court justice – his defense against the allegations crossed a line that no nominee for the high court should cross .
His testimony “ was a sad day for our country , ” says Kermit Roosevelt , a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Law in Philadelphia . “ Kavanaugh ’ s sense of partisan bitterness was disturbing in that it suggests partisan concerns will affect his judicial behavior . ”
Supreme Court confirmations have become political war zones in recent years , but this particular confirmation was always likely to have even more partisan energy . Mr. Trump has committed to only nominating jurists with strong conservative credentials , and this nominee would replace Justice Anthony Kennedy , the court ’ s longtime swing justice who ruled in favor of liberals on issues like same-sex marriage , abortion rights , and affirmative action .
“ We must always remember that it is when passions are most inflamed that fairness is most in jeopardy , ” Collins said in her speech on the Senate floor . “ Despite the turbulent bitter fights surrounding his nomination , my fervent hope is that Brett Kavanaugh will work to lessen the divisions in the Supreme Court so that we have far fewer 5-4 decisions , and so that public confidence in our judiciary and our highest court is restored . ”
Given the context , it is perhaps unsurprising this confirmation played out as a more extreme version of another bitter confirmation battle .
Justice Clarence Thomas also fiercely defended himself against sordid allegations , in his case from Anita Hill , a former assistant at the Department of Education , during his 1991 confirmation . But while Justice Thomas , an African-American , famously called the eleventh-hour sexual harassment accusations a “ high-tech lynching for uppity blacks , ” he displayed a calm temperament in his response , never directly blaming Senate Democrats . The Democrat-controlled chamber ultimately confirmed him 52-to-48 .
Last week , Kavanaugh was combative and hostile toward Democrats . He interrupted Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D ) of California , the committee ’ s ranking member , and asked Sen. Amy Klobuchar ( D ) of Minnesota whether she had ever blacked out from drinking ( he later apologized ) . The tone took aback even those who supported his confirmation .
“ I was very troubled by the tone of [ his ] remarks , ” said Sen. Jeff Flake ( R ) of Arizona , a moderate who last Friday pushed for the additional FBI investigation .
“ I tell myself , ‘ You give a little leeway because of what he ’ s been through , ’ ” he added . “ But on the other hand , we can ’ t have this on the court . We simply can ’ t . ”
Benjamin Wittes , editor in chief of the Lawfare blog who says he ’ s known Kavanaugh for 20 years , wrote in the Atlantic , “ the Brett Kavanaugh who showed up to [ last week ’ s ] hearing is a man I have never met . ”
“ Faced with credible allegations of misconduct against him , Kavanaugh behaved in a fashion unacceptable of a justice , ” he added . “ Can anyone seriously entertain the notion that a reasonable pro-choice woman would feel like her position could get a fair shake before a Justice Kavanaugh ? Can anyone seriously entertain the notion that a reasonable Democrat , or a reasonable liberal of any kind , would , after that performance , consider him a fair arbiter in , say , a case about partisan gerrymandering , voter identification , or anything else with a strong partisan valence ? ”
More than 2,400 law professors signed a letter saying his testimony displayed a lack of judicial restraint that should be disqualifying . On Thursday , retired Justice John Paul Stevens , a Gerald Ford appointee who served on the court for 35 years , agreed .
“ I ’ ve changed my views for reasons that have no really relationship to his intellectual ability or his record as a federal judge . He 's a fine federal judge , ” he said . “ I think that his performance during the hearings caused me to change my mind . ”
If confirmed , Kavanaugh would join a court with eroding public confidence . About half of Americans had a great deal of confidence in the Supreme Court prior to its Bush v. Gore decision in 2000 , according to Gallup polling . In June , the most recent Gallup measurement , 37 percent of Americans had faith in the institution .
If Kavanaugh becomes part of a conservative majority in a controversial 5-to-4 decision , that could further damage the court ’ s reputation , says Jon Michaels , a professor at the University of California , Los Angeles , School of Law .
“ Every time [ a 5-to-4 decision ] comes up we ’ re going to revisit those moments ” from the hearing , he adds . “ That ’ s going to reinforce concerns that the court is entirely political , and for some it will say this is a further reason why it ’ s not a legitimate body . ”
In his Wall Street Journal op-ed , Kavanaugh wrote that his testimony last week “ reflected my overwhelming frustration at being wrongly accused ... [ and ] my deep distress at the unfairness of how this allegation has been handled . ”
“ Going forward , you can count on me to be the same kind of judge and person I have been for my entire 28-year legal career : hardworking , even-keeled , open-minded , independent and dedicated to the Constitution and the public good , ” he added . “ I have not changed . ”
“ The best example of his judicial temperament is the temperament he brought to the bench for 12 years on the D.C. Circuit , ” says Adam White , an assistant professor at the Antonin Scalia Law School . “ He was an impartial and well-regarded judge throughout his time on the D.C . Circuit even after having worked in the Bush administration and for Ken Starr , ” the independent counsel whose investigation of former-President Bill Clinton led to an impeachment vote .
And while Supreme Court confirmations are always political , what institutional damage they cause is typically confined to the Senate .
“ What detracts from the court ’ s legitimacy is the conduct of the court in deciding cases , ” he adds . “ All judges are expected to take their personal attachments and personal instincts and personal feelings and set them aside as best as anyone can .... I would presume he like all judges will do the best he can , and he will succeed in that . ”
The vote Friday morning suggests the investigation may have been enough to assuage the concerns the likes of Senator Flake harbored about Kavanaugh ’ s temperament . But for others , there are still lingering doubts .
For Professor Roosevelt “ the main concern was less the emotion than the partisanship ” Kavanaugh displayed last week .
“ It ’ s very standard for judges to proclaim themselves nonpartisan , even when they then go on and act in partisan ways , ” he adds in an email . “ I take the more or less open admission of a partisan understanding of the world to be more informative than the standard denial . ”
Ultimately , time would be the test of whether the Kavanaugh from the first hearing or the Kavanaugh from the second hearing would best reflect a Justice Kavanaugh .
Justice Thomas ’ s post-confirmation behavior is the closest , albeit still an imperfect , parallel . Already deeply conservative before he joined the high court , legal scholars don ’ t think the confirmation process changed his jurisprudence . It may have changed his behavior off the bench , however .
Unlike other conservative justices , such as Antonin Scalia , for many years Thomas kept a more selective public speaking schedule . For years he refused to speak at Ivy League law schools ( including Yale , his alma mater ) , and fraternized mostly with other conservatives , according to Charles Fried , a conservative Harvard law professor and colleague of Thomas ’ s in the Reagan administration .
“ The effect of that has been to harden his point of view and to make him more extreme and isolated in his ideas , ” Professor Fried told NPR in 2011 .
If he is confirmed , Kavanaugh will face a similar choice about whether to similarly cloister himself by socializing only with like-minded people .
Earlier this week he withdrew from a Harvard Law School class he had been scheduled to teach in January . Hundreds of alumni have called for his lectureship at the school to be rescinded , and current students have called for a school-led investigation into sexual assault allegations against him .
“ He ’ s going to have to pick his battles if he is looking to win people over rather than just hunker down in his own camp , ” says Professor Michaels . “ Which way he goes will also be quite revealing . ”
No matter how Kavanaugh conducts himself after he is confirmed , significant partisan opposition would remain . Senate Democrats have questioned the depth of this week ’ s FBI investigation – the White House barred agents from interviewing either Kavanaugh or his first accuser , Dr. Christine Blasey Ford . Other Democrats have discussed investigating whether he should be impeached . Gallup polling last week shows that Americans are closely and ideologically divided on his confirmation .
The court has responded to a fraught partisan moment in the recent past . Two years ago , as Senate Republicans blocked Judge Merrick Garland ’ s nomination , the short-handed and ideologically-split court avoided major cases and resolved many others on narrow legal grounds .
Still , every justice is a human being who is “ the sum of the parts of a personal past , ” wrote Lyle Denniston , a journalist who has covered the Supreme Court for 60 years , for the National Constitution Center . If Kavanaugh takes the anger and hurt feelings he says he ’ s felt in the past few weeks , his colleagues on the high court would be in a position to ensure that doesn ’ t damage the institution ’ s credibility .
“ In the disciplines of the Court ’ s methods and habits , in the almost constant need to persuade others who bring their own visions and are just as smart as he is , in the reality that what he personally writes and makes public ought to read like law rather than spite , and that his ultimate standing in history will depend at least in part upon whether he has overcome the emotion of his experience as a nominee , ” he wrote . “ His colleagues would help him with that . ”","With Brett Kavanaugh poised to be confirmed Saturday after the most partisan Supreme Court nomination process in memory, there are widespread concerns that the attacks Judge Kavanaugh both received and delivered over the past month could resonate long into the future.

Furman said Ross’ credibility was at issue because there was doubt about his public statements that the Justice Department initiated the request to include the citizenship question and that he was not aware of any discussions with the White House about it.",www.reuters.com,center,pVj3poKDadLOGqjN

WASHINGTON – Two Republican senators who this week said they would be hesitant to proceed with a vote on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh until they had a chance to hear from a woman accusing him of sexual assault are strongly encouraging the accuser to appear at a scheduled hearing next week.

Sens. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., and Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., both called for a delay on Kavanaugh's confirmation vote, which had been scheduled for Thursday, after Palo Alto University professor Christine Blasey Ford came forward publicly as Kavanaugh's accuser in The Washington Post over the weekend.

Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, tried to arrange phone calls with Kavanaugh and Ford to discuss the allegation and eventually agreed to schedule a public hearing on Monday with both parties invited to testify. But Ford's attorney, Debra Katz, has since said that her client wants an FBI investigation into the alleged incident before testifying.

On Wednesday, Grassley sent a series of tweets in which he said ""Ford shouldn't be threatened or insulted,"" that she ""deserves to be heard"" and that he expects his ""colleagues on both sides of the aisle to be respectful & treat the situation with the sensitivity it deserves.""

But he also dismissed the calls for an FBI investigation.

Grassley said committee investigators are ""following up on the leads from Dr. Ford's allegations"" and ""no other OUTSIDE investigation is necessary.""

Ford alleges Kavanaugh held her down and tried to remove her clothes at a party when they were both in high school. Kavanaugh has strongly denied the accusation.

Corker said in a tweet early Wednesday that Grassley ""took immediate action to ensure both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh have the opportunity to be heard, in public or private.""

""Republicans extended a hand in good faith,"" he said. ""If we don't hear from both sides on Monday, let's vote.""

Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., who sits on the Judiciary Committee, strongly urged Ford to accept the Senate's invitation to speak on Monday.

""When Dr. Ford came forward, I said that her voice should be heard and asked the Judiciary Committee to delay its vote on Judge Kavanaugh. It did so,"" Flake said in a tweet Wednesday. ""I now implore Dr. Ford to accept the invitation for Monday in a public or private setting. The committee should hear her voice.""

President Donald Trump also indicated he hopes Ford attends Monday's scheduled hearing.

""I really would want to see what she has to say,"" Trump said.

He also said Democrats are ""hurting somebody’s life very badly"" with the allegation against Kavanaugh.

`` I believed he was going to rape me , '' Ford is expected to say , according to testimony released Wednesday by her attorney , Debra S. Katz .
Kavanaugh , President Donald Trump 's nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court , has strongly denied Ford 's allegations .
Ford will appear before the committee Thursday morning at 10 a.m. EDT , followed separately by Kavanaugh .
Here is the full text of Ford 's testimony , which she submitted to the Judiciary Committee on Wednesday :
Chairman Grassley , Ranking Member Feinstein , Members of the Committee . My name is Christine Blasey Ford . I am a Professor of Psychology at Palo Alto University and a Research Psychologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine .
I was an undergraduate at the University of North Carolina and earned my degree in
Experimental Psychology in 1988 . I received a Master ’ s degree in 1991 in Clinical Psychology from Pepperdine University . In 1996 , I received a PhD in Educational Psychology from the University of Southern California . I earned a Master ’ s degree in Epidemiology from the Stanford University School of Medicine in 2009 .
I have been married to Russell Ford since 2002 and we have two children .
I am here today not because I want to be . I am terrified . I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school . I have described the events publicly before . I summarized them in my letter to Ranking Member Feinstein , and again in my letter to Chairman Grassley . I understand and appreciate the importance of your hearing from me directly about what happened to me and the impact it has had on my life and on my family .
I grew up in the suburbs of Washington , D.C . I attended the Holton-Arms School in
Bethesda , Maryland , from 1980 to 1984 . Holton-Arms is an all-girls school that opened in 1901 . During my time at the school , girls at Holton-Arms frequently met and became friendly with boys from all-boys schools in the area , including Landon School , Georgetown Prep , Gonzaga High School , country clubs , and other places where kids and their families socialized . This is how I met Brett Kavanaugh , the boy who sexually assaulted me .
In my freshman and sophomore school years , when I was 14 and 15 years old , my group of friends intersected with Brett and his friends for a short period of time . I had been friendly with a classmate of Brett ’ s for a short time during my freshman year , and it was through that connection that I attended a number of parties that Brett also attended . We did not know each other well , but I knew him and he knew me . In the summer of 1982 , like most summers , I spent almost every day at the Columbia Country Club in Chevy Chase , Maryland swimming and practicing diving .
One evening that summer , after a day of swimming at the club , I attended a small gathering at a house in the Chevy Chase/Bethesda area . There were four boys I remember being there : Brett Kavanaugh , Mark Judge , P.J . Smyth , and one other boy whose name I can not recall . I remember my friend Leland Ingham attending . I do not remember all of the details of how that gathering came together , but like many that summer , it was almost surely a spur of the moment gathering . I truly wish I could provide detailed answers to all of the questions that have been and will be asked about how I got to the party , where it took place , and so forth . I don ’ t have all the answers , and I don ’ t remember as much as I would like to . But the details about that night that bring me here today are ones I will never forget . They have been seared into my memory and have haunted me episodically as an adult .
When I got to the small gathering , people were drinking beer in a small living room on the first floor of the house . I drank one beer that evening . Brett and Mark were visibly drunk . Early in the evening , I went up a narrow set of stairs leading from the living room to a second floor to use the bathroom . When I got to the top of the stairs , I was pushed from behind into a bedroom . I couldn ’ t see who pushed me . Brett and Mark came into the bedroom and locked the door behind them . There was music already playing in the bedroom . It was turned up louder by either Brett or Mark once we were in the room . I was pushed onto the bed and Brett got on top of me . He began running his hands over my body and grinding his hips into me . I yelled , hoping someone downstairs might hear me , and tried to get away from him , but his weight was heavy . Brett groped me and tried to take off my clothes . He had a hard time because he was so drunk , and because I was wearing a one-piece bathing suit under my clothes . I believed he was going to rape me . I tried to yell for help . When I did , Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from screaming . This was what terrified me the most , and has had the most lasting impact on my life . It was hard for me to breathe , and I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me . Both Brett and Mark were drunkenly laughing during the attack . They both seemed to be having a good time . Mark was urging Brett on , although at times he told Brett to stop . A couple of times I made eye contact with Mark and thought he might try to help me , but he did not .
During this assault , Mark came over and jumped on the bed twice while Brett was on top of me . The last time he did this , we toppled over and Brett was no longer on top of me . I was able to get up and run out of the room . Directly across from the bedroom was a small bathroom . I ran inside the bathroom and locked the door . I heard Brett and Mark leave the bedroom laughing and loudly walk down the narrow stairs , pin-balling off the walls on the way down . I waited and when I did not hear them come back up the stairs , I left the bathroom , ran down the stairs , through the living room , and left the house . I remember being on the street and feeling an enormous sense of relief that I had escaped from the house and that Brett and Mark were not coming after me .
Brett ’ s assault on me drastically altered my life . For a very long time , I was too afraid and ashamed to tell anyone the details . I did not want to tell my parents that I , at age 15 , was in a house without any parents present , drinking beer with boys . I tried to convince myself that because Brett did not rape me , I should be able to move on and just pretend that it had never happened . Over the years , I told very few friends that I had this traumatic experience . I told my husband before we were married that I had experienced a sexual assault . I had never told the details to anyone until May 2012 , during a couples counseling session . The reason this came up in counseling is that my husband and I had completed an extensive remodel of our home , and I insisted on a second front door , an idea that he and others disagreed with and could not understand . In explaining why I wanted to have a second front door , I described the assault in detail . I recall saying that the boy who assaulted me could someday be on the U.S. Supreme Court and spoke a bit about his background . My husband recalls that I named my attacker as Brett Kavanaugh .
After that May 2012 therapy session , I did my best to suppress memories of the assault because recounting the details caused me to relive the experience , and caused panic attacks and anxiety . Occasionally I would discuss the assault in individual therapy , but talking about it caused me to relive the trauma , so I tried not to think about it or discuss it . But over the years , I went through periods where I thought about Brett ’ s attack . I confided in some close friends that I had an experience with sexual assault . Occasionally I stated that my assailant was a prominent lawyer or judge but I did not use his name . I do not recall each person I spoke to about Brett ’ s assault , and some friends have reminded me of these conversations since the publication of The Washington Post story on September 16 , 2018 . But until July 2018 , I had never named Mr. Kavanaugh as my attacker outside of therapy .
This all changed in early July 2018 . I saw press reports stating that Brett Kavanaugh was on the “ short list ” of potential Supreme Court nominees . I thought it was my civic duty to relay the information I had about Mr. Kavanaugh ’ s conduct so that those considering his potential nomination would know about the assault .
On July 6 , 2018 , I had a sense of urgency to relay the information to the Senate and the President as soon as possible before a nominee was selected . I called my congressional representative and let her receptionist know that someone on the President ’ s shortlist had attacked me . I also sent a message to The Washington Post ’ s confidential tip line . I did not use my name , but I provided the names of Brett Kavanaugh and Mark Judge . I stated that Mr. Kavanaugh had assaulted me in the 1980s in Maryland . This was an extremely hard thing for me to do , but I felt I couldn ’ t NOT do it . Over the next two days , I told a couple of close friends on the each in California that Mr. Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted me . I was conflicted about whether to speak out .
On July 9 , 2018 , I received a call from the office of Congresswoman Anna Eshoo after Mr. Kavanaugh had become the nominee . I met with her staff on July 11 and with her on July 13 , describing the assault and discussing my fear about coming forward . Later , we discussed the possibility of sending a letter to Ranking Member Feinstein , who is one of my state ’ s Senators , describing what occurred . My understanding is that Representative Eshoo ’ s office delivered a copy of my letter to Senator Feinstein ’ s office on July 30 , 2018 . The letter included my name , but requested that the letter be kept confidential .
My hope was that providing the information confidentially would be sufficient to allow the Senate to consider Mr. Kavanaugh ’ s serious misconduct without having to make myself , my family , or anyone ’ s family vulnerable to the personal attacks and invasions of privacy we have faced since my name became public . In a letter on August 31 , 2018 , Senator Feinstein wrote that she would not share the letter without my consent . I greatly appreciated this commitment . All sexual assault victims should be able to decide for themselves whether their private experience is made public .
As the hearing date got closer , I struggled with a terrible choice : Do I share the facts with the Senate and put myself and my family in the public spotlight ? Or do I preserve our privacy and allow the Senate to make its decision on Mr. Kavanaugh ’ s nomination without knowing the full truth about his past behavior ?
I agonized daily with this decision throughout August and early September 2018 . The sense of duty that motivated me to reach out confidentially to The Washington Post , Representative Eshoo ’ s office , and Senator Feinstein ’ s office was always there , but my fears of the consequences of speaking out started to increase .
During August 2018 , the press reported that Mr. Kavanaugh ’ s confirmation was virtually certain . His allies painted him as a champion of women ’ s rights and empowerment . I believed that if I came forward , my voice would be drowned out by a chorus of powerful supporters . By the time of the confirmation hearings , I had resigned myself to remaining quiet and letting the Committee and the Senate make their decision without knowing what Mr. Kavanaugh had done to me .
Once the press started reporting on the existence of the letter I had sent to Senator Feinstein , I faced mounting pressure . Reporters appeared at my home and at my job demanding information about this letter , including in the presence of my graduate students . They called my boss and coworkers and left me many messages , making it clear that my name would inevitably be released to the media . I decided to speak out publicly to a journalist who had responded to the tip I had sent to The Washington Post and who had gained my trust . It was important to me to describe the details of the assault in my own words .
Since September 16 , the date of The Washington Post story , I have experienced an
outpouring of support from people in every state of this country . Thousands of people who have had their lives dramatically altered by sexual violence have reached out to share their own experiences with me and have thanked me for coming forward . We have received tremendous support from friends and our community .
At the same time , my greatest fears have been realized – and the reality has been far worse than what I expected . My family and I have been the target of constant harassment and death threats . I have been called the most vile and hateful names imaginable . These messages , while far fewer than the expressions of support , have been terrifying to receive and have rocked me to my core . People have posted my personal information on the internet . This has resulted in additional emails , calls , and threats . My family and I were forced to move out of our home . Since September 16 , my family and I have been living in various secure locales , with guards . This past Tuesday evening , my work email account was hacked and messages were sent out supposedly recanting my description of the sexual assault .
Apart from the assault itself , these last couple of weeks have been the hardest of my life . I have had to relive my trauma in front of the entire world , and have seen my life picked apart by people on television , in the media , and in this body who have never met me or spoken with me . I have been accused of acting out of partisan political motives . Those who say that do not know me . I am a fiercely independent person and I am no one ’ s pawn . My motivation in coming forward was to provide the facts about how Mr. Kavanaugh ’ s actions have damaged my life , so that you can take that into serious consideration as you make your decision about how to proceed . It is not my responsibility to determine whether Mr. Kavanaugh deserves to sit on the Supreme Court . My responsibility is to tell the truth .
I understand that the Majority has hired a professional prosecutor to ask me some questions , and I am committed to doing my very best to answer them . At the same time , because the Committee Members will be judging my credibility , I hope to be able to engage directly with each of you .
At this point , I will do my best to answer your questions .

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – Christine Blasey Ford is expected to tell members of the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday that she was terrified when Brett Kavanaugh allegedly attacked her more than 30 years ago at a high school party in suburban Maryland.

""I believed he was going to rape me,"" Ford is expected to say, according to testimony released Wednesday by her attorney, Debra S. Katz.

Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump's nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court, has strongly denied Ford's allegations.

Ford will appear before the committee Thursday morning at 10 a.m. EDT, followed separately by Kavanaugh.

Here is the full text of Ford's testimony, which she submitted to the Judiciary Committee on Wednesday:

Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Feinstein, Members of the Committee. My name is Christine Blasey Ford. I am a Professor of Psychology at Palo Alto University and a Research Psychologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine.

I was an undergraduate at the University of North Carolina and earned my degree in

Experimental Psychology in 1988. I received a Master’s degree in 1991 in Clinical Psychology from Pepperdine University. In 1996, I received a PhD in Educational Psychology from the University of Southern California. I earned a Master’s degree in Epidemiology from the Stanford University School of Medicine in 2009.

I have been married to Russell Ford since 2002 and we have two children.

I am here today not because I want to be. I am terrified. I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school. I have described the events publicly before. I summarized them in my letter to Ranking Member Feinstein, and again in my letter to Chairman Grassley. I understand and appreciate the importance of your hearing from me directly about what happened to me and the impact it has had on my life and on my family.

I grew up in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. I attended the Holton-Arms School in

Bethesda, Maryland, from 1980 to 1984. Holton-Arms is an all-girls school that opened in 1901. During my time at the school, girls at Holton-Arms frequently met and became friendly with boys from all-boys schools in the area, including Landon School, Georgetown Prep, Gonzaga High School, country clubs, and other places where kids and their families socialized. This is how I met Brett Kavanaugh, the boy who sexually assaulted me.

In my freshman and sophomore school years, when I was 14 and 15 years old, my group of friends intersected with Brett and his friends for a short period of time. I had been friendly with a classmate of Brett’s for a short time during my freshman year, and it was through that connection that I attended a number of parties that Brett also attended. We did not know each other well, but I knew him and he knew me. In the summer of 1982, like most summers, I spent almost every day at the Columbia Country Club in Chevy Chase, Maryland swimming and practicing diving.

One evening that summer, after a day of swimming at the club, I attended a small gathering at a house in the Chevy Chase/Bethesda area. There were four boys I remember being there: Brett Kavanaugh, Mark Judge, P.J. Smyth, and one other boy whose name I cannot recall. I remember my friend Leland Ingham attending. I do not remember all of the details of how that gathering came together, but like many that summer, it was almost surely a spur of the moment gathering. I truly wish I could provide detailed answers to all of the questions that have been and will be asked about how I got to the party, where it took place, and so forth. I don’t have all the answers, and I don’t remember as much as I would like to. But the details about that night that bring me here today are ones I will never forget. They have been seared into my memory and have haunted me episodically as an adult.

When I got to the small gathering, people were drinking beer in a small living room on the first floor of the house. I drank one beer that evening. Brett and Mark were visibly drunk. Early in the evening, I went up a narrow set of stairs leading from the living room to a second floor to use the bathroom. When I got to the top of the stairs, I was pushed from behind into a bedroom. I couldn’t see who pushed me. Brett and Mark came into the bedroom and locked the door behind them. There was music already playing in the bedroom. It was turned up louder by either Brett or Mark once we were in the room. I was pushed onto the bed and Brett got on top of me. He began running his hands over my body and grinding his hips into me. I yelled, hoping someone downstairs might hear me, and tried to get away from him, but his weight was heavy. Brett groped me and tried to take off my clothes. He had a hard time because he was so drunk, and because I was wearing a one-piece bathing suit under my clothes. I believed he was going to rape me. I tried to yell for help. When I did, Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from screaming. This was what terrified me the most, and has had the most lasting impact on my life. It was hard for me to breathe, and I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me. Both Brett and Mark were drunkenly laughing during the attack. They both seemed to be having a good time. Mark was urging Brett on, although at times he told Brett to stop. A couple of times I made eye contact with Mark and thought he might try to help me, but he did not.

During this assault, Mark came over and jumped on the bed twice while Brett was on top of me. The last time he did this, we toppled over and Brett was no longer on top of me. I was able to get up and run out of the room. Directly across from the bedroom was a small bathroom. I ran inside the bathroom and locked the door. I heard Brett and Mark leave the bedroom laughing and loudly walk down the narrow stairs, pin-balling off the walls on the way down. I waited and when I did not hear them come back up the stairs, I left the bathroom, ran down the stairs, through the living room, and left the house. I remember being on the street and feeling an enormous sense of relief that I had escaped from the house and that Brett and Mark were not coming after me.

Brett’s assault on me drastically altered my life. For a very long time, I was too afraid and ashamed to tell anyone the details. I did not want to tell my parents that I, at age 15, was in a house without any parents present, drinking beer with boys. I tried to convince myself that because Brett did not rape me, I should be able to move on and just pretend that it had never happened. Over the years, I told very few friends that I had this traumatic experience. I told my husband before we were married that I had experienced a sexual assault. I had never told the details to anyone until May 2012, during a couples counseling session. The reason this came up in counseling is that my husband and I had completed an extensive remodel of our home, and I insisted on a second front door, an idea that he and others disagreed with and could not understand. In explaining why I wanted to have a second front door, I described the assault in detail. I recall saying that the boy who assaulted me could someday be on the U.S. Supreme Court and spoke a bit about his background. My husband recalls that I named my attacker as Brett Kavanaugh.

Senators voted to end debate on Kavanaugh ’ s nomination , setting up a confirmation vote for Saturday afternoon .
Senate Republicans acknowledged ahead of time that they might not know the outcome of the vote by the time it started — an unusual move for a leadership team that likes to keep a tight grip on floor action .

Murkowski , however , voted against advancing the nomination , the only Republican to do so .
She voiced her opposition so softly that senators on the floor and members of the press in the overhead galleries had trouble discerning if she was a yes or a no .

Murkowski told reporters after the vote that she has been “ wrestling ” with the decision , which she described as the “ most difficult ” of her political career .
“ I have been wrestling with whether or not this was about the qualifications of a good man or is this bigger than the nominee and I believe we are dealing with issues right now that are bigger than a nominee , ” Murkowski said .
She added that while she considers Kavanaugh a “ good man … it just may be that in my view he 's not the right man for the court at this time . ''

Daines , after the cloture vote , told reporters that they had the final vote “ covered . ”
“ We ’ re going to have a new Supreme Court justice this weekend and I ’ m going to get to walk my daughter down the aisle , ” Daines said .

Senate Republicans acknowledged ahead of time that they might not know the outcome of the vote by the time it started — an unusual move for a leadership team that likes to keep a tight grip on floor action.

“This may be one of the exceptions to the rule. Ordinarily we would know but a number of my colleagues … reserve their right to make their own announcement,” Sen. John Cornyn John CornynGOP senators balk at lengthy impeachment trial Overnight Health Care: Trump officials making changes to drug pricing proposal | House panel advances flavored e-cig ban | Senators press FDA tobacco chief on vaping ban Senate GOP waves Trump off early motion to dismiss impeachment charges MORE (R-Texas), the Senate majority whip, said Friday morning before the cloture vote. “So there’s going to be a lot of drama.”

Kavanaugh’s nomination got a last-minute boost when Flake, Manchin and Collins voted to end debate on Kavanaugh’s nomination. Manchin was the only Democrat to vote “yes.”

Murkowski, however, voted against advancing the nomination, the only Republican to do so.

She voiced her opposition so softly that senators on the floor and members of the press in the overhead galleries had trouble discerning if she was a yes or a no.

Murkowski told reporters after the vote that she has been “wrestling” with the decision, which she described as the “most difficult” of her political career.

“I have been wrestling with whether or not this was about the qualifications of a good man or is this bigger than the nominee and I believe we are dealing with issues right now that are bigger than a nominee,” Murkowski said.

She added that while she considers Kavanaugh a “good man … it just may be that in my view he's not the right man for the court at this time.""

Republicans hold a slim two-seat majority in the Senate, which allows them to lose one vote from their conference and still confirm Kavanaugh without Democratic help.

The vote’s drama was upped a notch Thursday evening when Sen. Steve Daines Steven (Steve) David DainesFallout from Kavanaugh confirmation felt in Washington one year later Conservatives offer stark warning to Trump, GOP on background checks The 23 Republicans who opposed Trump-backed budget deal MORE (R-Mont.) announced that he would leave Washington after the procedural vote to fly to Montana for his daughter’s wedding on Saturday, possibly leaving Republicans short-handed for the final confirmation vote.

Cornyn told a Texas radio station on Friday that GOP leaders have been in “close consultation” with Daines and are “working closely with him to figure it out.”

Daines, after the cloture vote, told reporters that they had the final vote “covered.”

“We’re going to have a new Supreme Court justice this weekend and I’m going to get to walk my daughter down the aisle,” Daines said.

But Kavanaugh isn’t, yet, a lock for confirmation.

The situation was made more uncertain because leadership believes Murkowski will be a “no” vote on the final up-or-down confirmation vote. Sen. John Thune John Randolph ThuneSenate GOP waves Trump off early motion to dismiss impeachment charges Trump encounters GOP resistance to investigating Hunter Biden Republicans warn election results are 'wake-up call' for Trump MORE (R-S.D.), the No. 3 GOP Senator, said he would be “surprised” if she changes her mind and votes to confirm Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court seat.

supreme_court,Guest Writer - Left,0,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/supreme-court-giant-bladensburg-cross-church-state-kavanaugh.html,OPINION: The Supreme Court’s Giant Cross Compromise Will Erode the Separation of Church and State,2019-06-20,Mark Joseph Stern,"The separation of church and state survived a close brush with death on Thursday , emerging scathed but alive thanks to a compromise decision that may not hold for long . Seven justices voted to allow a 94-year-old , 40-foot cross to remain on public land and those managing the cross to continue receiving state funding . But that lopsided vote conceals deep fractures among the justices over the government ’ s authority to honor and promote religion . The majority opinion portends more radical decisions to come while doing real damage to the establishment clause today , diminishing the state ’ s obligation to respect all faiths by endorsing none .
Thursday ’ s ruling in American Legion v. American Humanist Association rests on a magic trick : The majority transmogrified the cross , a “ preeminent Christian symbol , ” into a monument with a “ secular meaning. ” This is no mean feat . The cross in question rests at the center of a busy intersection in Bladensburg , Maryland . It towers over everything around it . Completed in 1925 , the “ Bladensburg Peace Cross ” was designed as a tribute to 49 area soldiers who died in World War I . At its dedication ceremony , a Catholic priest gave an invocation ; state representatives encouraged the community to view the monument as “ symbolic of Calvary ” ; and the ceremony ended with a benediction provided by a Baptist pastor . The Bladensburg cross is , indisputably , a symbol of Christianity .
That fact creates a problem under the First Amendment , which prohibits any law “ respecting an establishment of religion. ” The American Humanist Association filed a lawsuit against the state commission that owns the cross , demanding that it transfer the monument to private lands , convert it to an obelisk , or demolish it . According to the AHA , the cross violates the Lemon test , a standard sometimes used by SCOTUS to assess establishment clause disputes . Under that test , a government action must have a secular purpose ; it must not advance or inhibit religion ; and it must not foster excessive entanglement between religion and government . The 4th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals found that the cross runs afoul of the Lemon test because a reasonable observer would view the cross as an endorsement of Christianity , thereby impermissibly advancing a certain religious belief .
Spoiler alert : The Supreme Court ’ s conservative majority was never going to uphold the 4th Circuit ’ s decision . Right-leaning justices loathe the Lemon test because it is both stringent and malleable , giving courts too much power ( in their minds ) to enforce government secularism . The big question in American Legion , then , was how severely SCOTUS would hobble the Lemon test and , by extension , the establishment clause . And the answer is … complicated . Justice Samuel Alito ’ s majority opinion abolishes the test ’ s application to “ established , religiously expressive monuments , symbols , and practices. ” But it leaves Lemon applicable , for now , to other church-state cases .
Why are “ monuments , symbols , and practices ” different ? Alito , joined by Chief Justice John Roberts , as well as Justices Brett Kavanaugh , Stephen Breyer , and Elena Kagan , gave four reasons . First , “ identifying their original purpose or purposes may be especially difficult. ” Second , their “ purposes … often multiply ” with the passage of time . Third , and relatedly , their “ message ” may “ evolve ” over time—shifting from sectarian to secular . Fourth , removing them once they ’ ve gained “ familiarity and historical significance ” may “ strike many as aggressively hostile to religion. ” ( Note the contradiction here : A long-standing cross no longer conveys a purely Christian message , but removing it may convey an anti-Christian message . Go figure . )
In light of these concerns , Alito wrote , the Lemon test is ill-suited to “ monuments , symbols , and practices ” that have been around for a while . Instead , the “ passage of time ” gives them “ a strong presumption of constitutionality. ” And there is nothing to rebut that presumption here , since “ a World War I cross remains a memorial to the fallen ” and a “ symbol of their sacrifice , ” whatever its other implications . Even if it began as a Christian monument , it has “ acquired additional layers of historical meaning in subsequent years. ” Those layers mean that , today , the cross “ does not offend the Constitution . ”
What , exactly , is the rule laid down here ? Alito wrote that religious monuments “ to soldiers who sacrificed their lives for this country more than a century ago ” are constitutional . What about a monument to soldiers who died a half-century ago ? How about in the past decade ? Or yesterday ? Alito doesn ’ t say—presumably to hang onto Breyer and Kagan ’ s votes . Both liberal justices wrote separately to limit the majority opinion . Breyer noted that a cross “ erected only recently ” would not pass constitutional muster . Kagan declined to join a portion of the opinion bashing Lemon but agreed that it wasn ’ t necessary to apply it here .
By contrast , Kavanaugh wrote separately to insist that “ this Court no longer applies the old test articulated in Lemon. ” In other words , Kavanaugh suggested , SCOTUS doesn ’ t have to kill Lemon because Lemon is already dead . Instead , the court ostensibly applies a rather convoluted standard : If a “ challenged government practice is not coercive ” and it is rooted in history or tradition , or treats religion and secularism equally , or constitutes an accommodation or exemption for the faithful , then it ’ s constitutional . I ’ m not sure Kavanaugh ’ s effort to retcon a new establishment clause rule into “ the last 48 years ” of Supreme Court jurisprudence will be successful , but it ’ s a valiant effort .
Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate opinion to reiterate his belief that the establishment clause does not apply to the states , meaning a state legislature could literally establish an official religion without infringing upon the Constitution . Justice Neil Gorsuch , joined by Thomas , wrote to insist that individuals offended by a religious symbol shouldn ’ t have standing to sue in the first place . For good measure , Gorsuch also disparaged the Lemon test and declared that the court had “ shelved ” it . And , weirdly , he interpreted the court ’ s decision as one allowing the government to build a public cross any time it wants , ignoring its many qualifications about the importance of a monument ’ s age in assessing its constitutionality .

The separation of church and state survived a close brush with death on Thursday, emerging scathed but alive thanks to a compromise decision that may not hold for long. Seven justices voted to allow a 94-year-old, 40-foot cross to remain on public land and those managing the cross to continue receiving state funding. But that lopsided vote conceals deep fractures among the justices over the government’s authority to honor and promote religion. The majority opinion portends more radical decisions to come while doing real damage to the establishment clause today, diminishing the state’s obligation to respect all faiths by endorsing none.

Thursday’s ruling in American Legion v. American Humanist Association rests on a magic trick: The majority transmogrified the cross, a “preeminent Christian symbol,” into a monument with a “secular meaning.” This is no mean feat. The cross in question rests at the center of a busy intersection in Bladensburg, Maryland. It towers over everything around it. Completed in 1925, the “Bladensburg Peace Cross” was designed as a tribute to 49 area soldiers who died in World War I. At its dedication ceremony, a Catholic priest gave an invocation; state representatives encouraged the community to view the monument as “symbolic of Calvary”; and the ceremony ended with a benediction provided by a Baptist pastor. The Bladensburg cross is, indisputably, a symbol of Christianity.

That fact creates a problem under the First Amendment, which prohibits any law “respecting an establishment of religion.” The American Humanist Association filed a lawsuit against the state commission that owns the cross, demanding that it transfer the monument to private lands, convert it to an obelisk, or demolish it. According to the AHA, the cross violates the Lemon test, a standard sometimes used by SCOTUS to assess establishment clause disputes. Under that test, a government action must have a secular purpose; it must not advance or inhibit religion; and it must not foster excessive entanglement between religion and government. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that the cross runs afoul of the Lemon test because a reasonable observer would view the cross as an endorsement of Christianity, thereby impermissibly advancing a certain religious belief.

Spoiler alert: The Supreme Court’s conservative majority was never going to uphold the 4th Circuit’s decision. Right-leaning justices loathe the Lemon test because it is both stringent and malleable, giving courts too much power (in their minds) to enforce government secularism. The big question in American Legion, then, was how severely SCOTUS would hobble the Lemon test and, by extension, the establishment clause. And the answer is … complicated. Justice Samuel Alito’s majority opinion abolishes the test’s application to “established, religiously expressive monuments, symbols, and practices.” But it leaves Lemon applicable, for now, to other church-state cases.

What, exactly, is the rule laid down here?

Why are “monuments, symbols, and practices” different? Alito, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts, as well as Justices Brett Kavanaugh, Stephen Breyer, and Elena Kagan, gave four reasons. First, “identifying their original purpose or purposes may be especially difficult.” Second, their “purposes … often multiply” with the passage of time. Third, and relatedly, their “message” may “evolve” over time—shifting from sectarian to secular. Fourth, removing them once they’ve gained “familiarity and historical significance” may “strike many as aggressively hostile to religion.” (Note the contradiction here: A long-standing cross no longer conveys a purely Christian message, but removing it may convey an anti-Christian message. Go figure.)

In light of these concerns, Alito wrote, the Lemon test is ill-suited to “monuments, symbols, and practices” that have been around for a while. Instead, the “passage of time” gives them “a strong presumption of constitutionality.” And there is nothing to rebut that presumption here, since “a World War I cross remains a memorial to the fallen” and a “symbol of their sacrifice,” whatever its other implications. Even if it began as a Christian monument, it has “acquired additional layers of historical meaning in subsequent years.” Those layers mean that, today, the cross “does not offend the Constitution.”

What, exactly, is the rule laid down here? Alito wrote that religious monuments “to soldiers who sacrificed their lives for this country more than a century ago” are constitutional. What about a monument to soldiers who died a half-century ago? How about in the past decade? Or yesterday? Alito doesn’t say—presumably to hang onto Breyer and Kagan’s votes. Both liberal justices wrote separately to limit the majority opinion. Breyer noted that a cross “erected only recently” would not pass constitutional muster. Kagan declined to join a portion of the opinion bashing Lemon but agreed that it wasn’t necessary to apply it here.

By contrast, Kavanaugh wrote separately to insist that “this Court no longer applies the old test articulated in Lemon.” In other words, Kavanaugh suggested, SCOTUS doesn’t have to kill Lemon because Lemon is already dead. Instead, the court ostensibly applies a rather convoluted standard: If a “challenged government practice is not coercive” and it is rooted in history or tradition, or treats religion and secularism equally, or constitutes an accommodation or exemption for the faithful, then it’s constitutional. I’m not sure Kavanaugh’s effort to retcon a new establishment clause rule into “the last 48 years” of Supreme Court jurisprudence will be successful, but it’s a valiant effort.

Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate opinion to reiterate his belief that the establishment clause does not apply to the states, meaning a state legislature could literally establish an official religion without infringing upon the Constitution. Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined by Thomas, wrote to insist that individuals offended by a religious symbol shouldn’t have standing to sue in the first place. For good measure, Gorsuch also disparaged the Lemon test and declared that the court had “shelved” it. And, weirdly, he interpreted the court’s decision as one allowing the government to build a public cross any time it wants, ignoring its many qualifications about the importance of a monument’s age in assessing its constitutionality.

Only Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, dissented. After all the hedging and sniping between the majority and the concurrences, Ginsburg’s opinion is refreshingly straightforward. She reminds us of a simple truth: No matter how many secular meanings we might ascribe to it, the cross represents the “central theological claim of Christianity: that the son of God died on the cross, that he rose from the dead, and that his death and resurrection offer the possibility of eternal life.”

“As I see it,” Ginsburg wrote, “when a cross is displayed on public property, the government may be presumed to endorse its religious content.” The cross “elevates Christianity over other faiths, and religion over nonreligion”; it “affirms that, thanks to the soldier’s embrace of Christianity, he will be rewarded with eternal life.” Shortly after World War I, the government recognized the cross to be an inappropriate tribute to non-Christian soldiers, and the “overwhelming majority of World War I memorials contain no Latin cross.” (Ironically, while Alito’s majority opinion roots its analysis in “history and tradition,” Ginsburg’s dissent is far more attuned to the history of the Bladensburg cross and its place in World War I commemoration.) The cross, Ginsburg concluded, actively implies “official recognition of [Christianity] paramountcy and thus contravenes the Establishment Clause.”

Ginsburg and Sotomayor, however, are never going to persuade a majority of their colleagues to enforce bona fide separation of church and state. The real fight in American Legion is between Kavanaugh and Gorsuch on one side and Kagan and Breyer on the other.

And two, the gloves came off, with the justices hurling especially nasty words at each other, shattering the illusion that they are all good friends.

Election-year Supreme Court nominations are always governed by partisan concerns .
Neil Gorsuch is a careful judge , a lively writer , and a brilliant legal scholar . He ’ s received the highest possible rating from the left-leaning American Bar Association and the support of a number of liberals who have worked with him over the years . There ’ s nothing bad you can say about Gorsuch as a Supreme Court nominee .
Nothing , that is , except that Gorsuch is ( 1 ) a conservative who ( 2 ) was nominated by Donald Trump to ( 3 ) fill the same seat as Merrick Garland , the Obama nominee to whom Senate Republicans refused to give a vote , or even a hearing . Arch-partisan Democrats regard the seat vacated by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia as stolen , and Trump ’ s election as illegitimate , and they think these are reasons enough to vote against any Trump nominee to replace Scalia . As a result , the Gorsuch nomination will largely be a proxy fight over the legitimacy of the Senate ’ s rejection of the Garland nomination .
The Supreme Court confirmation process has been badly broken over the past three decades , and both parties have had a role in that . But the Garland nomination was a rare event in the modern Senate , because he was nominated in a presidential-election year by a president whose party did not control the Senate . Only once in U.S. history ( in 1888 ) has the Senate acted before Election Day to confirm a justice who was nominated in the last year of a presidential term by a president of the opposing party . Three others ( in 1845 , 1880 , and 1957 ) were confirmed only after the election :
‐In February 1845 , outgoing president John Tyler ( elected as a Whig but by then a man without a party ) had nominations pending for two open seats . The Democrats had won control of both the presidency and the Senate in the 1844 elections . The lame-duck Whig Senate confirmed one of Tyler ’ s two nominees ( Samuel Nelson , a Democrat , Tyler ’ s sixth nomination for that seat in 13 months ) , and left the other seat open for the incoming president after rejecting three efforts by Tyler to fill it .
‐In December 1880 , a vacancy opened after Election Day . Republicans had won the presidential election as well as enough Senate seats to deadlock the Senate . The lame-duck Democratic Senate confirmed William Woods , a Republican nominated by outgoing Republican president Rutherford B. Hayes , but when a second vacancy opened in January , they left that seat open for the incoming president ( James Garfield , another Republican ) .
‐In October 1956 , Republican president Dwight Eisenhower made a recess appointment of William Brennan , a liberal Democrat . Eisenhower went on to win a landslide reelection , and in January , the Democratic Senate confirmed Brennan .
By contrast , the Scalia vacancy was the seventh time that the Senate has held a Supreme Court vacancy open rather than confirm an election-year nominee . Besides Obama , and the Tyler and Hayes cases mentioned above , this happened to John Quincy Adams , Millard Fillmore , James Buchanan , and Lyndon Johnson . In all these cases but Hayes ’ s , the failure to confirm meant that a president of a different party would make the nomination ; in all but LBJ ’ s and Tyler ’ s , the incoming president would be from the same party that controlled the outgoing Senate . The Republican Congress went even further when Andrew Johnson was president : It eliminated Supreme Court seats as they became vacant , then restored them to be filled by the next Republican president . Johnson had made one nomination to a vacant seat , but the new law nullified it .
By contrast , nine election-year nominees and five post–Election Day nominees have been confirmed by the Senate when its majority was of the same party as the president . Only one president , Lyndon Johnson , has had a nominee rejected in this situation . In other words , as you ’ d expect , election-year nominations to the Court have usually been resolved on sharply partisan lines . So the Senate ’ s refusal to act on Garland is well within historical norms , and any Democratic effort to obstruct Gorsuch as payback would break new ground and possibly trigger the end of the judicial filibuster in its entirety .
The Supreme Court confirmation process is a subject of continuing controversy because it has historically been governed mainly by precedents and norms of behavior , not by rules . The Constitution establishes only two rules : The president “ shall nominate ” justices , “ and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate , shall appoint ” them . A third rule is established by the Senate itself : The Senate can ’ t proceed to vote on a nomination until debate has ended . The relevant rule has been changed four times , each time by a Democratic majority . In 1917 , cloture was introduced for legislative debates , allowing a two-thirds vote to end debate ( before then , there was no mechanism to stop even a single senator from filibustering indefinitely ) . In 1949 , the cloture rule was extended from legislative debates to nominations . In 1975 , the majority needed for cloture was dropped from two-thirds to three-fifths . And in 2013 , the filibuster was abolished for all judicial and executive nomination votes except for Supreme Court justices . Yet while Senate minorities have zealously guarded their power to filibuster Supreme Court nominees , that power has been used to stop a nomination only once , in 1968 . Every other time a nomination has been tabled or defeated , it has been done by the action of the majority party and/or a voting majority of senators .
Consider the varying methods by which nominations have failed to end in confirmation after being transmitted to the Senate ( failed nominees in purple on this table were for seats that were eventually filled by a president from a different party ) :
The procedural devices vary here , and the details of some Senate floor actions are lost to history ( I use “ NR ” where vote totals on Senate motions were not recorded and “ NA ” where no vote was taken , but I list Garland as being opposed 54–46 because no senator in either party publicly broke ranks on confirming him ) . Of the 35 failed nominations ( including the repeat nominations by John Tyler ) , twelve received an up-or-down confirmation vote , six were withdrawn without a vote being taken , 13 were defeated by some other Senate action requiring a vote , and four ( including Garland ) were allowed to expire .
Senate norms for confirming Supreme Court justices have changed over time , but there ’ s never been a norm in favor of approving a nomination like Garland ’ s . To see how norms have developed in this area , let ’ s review the history of all Supreme Court nominations sent to the Senate * , broken down by time period .
As was true of many aspects of American politics , the degree of partisanship in Supreme Court nominations varied widely in the Republic ’ s early days . Below is a list of all the nominees from 1789 to 1823 ; the time from the vacancy , nomination , and confirmation or rejection to the next presidential election ; the party of the president , the nominee , and the Senate majority ; the percentage of votes cast ( where available ) against each nominee ; and the ultimate disposition of the nomination . Orange refers to nominations made the year before the end of a presidential term , green to ones made in the final year , and purple to lame-duck nominations .
Congress ’ s sessions tended to be fairly brief in the early years , which explains why there were so many recess appointments in this period .
The next table provides a more granular look at the dates during the year when each nomination occurred . “ Since Nom ” is the time ( in days ) from nomination to resolution ( confirmation or rejection/withdrawal ) , and “ Since Vac ” is the time to those points from the original vacancy . In considering lame-duck nominations , bear in mind that before the 20th Amendment was enacted in 1933 , elections for a new Congress ( and , when applicable , a president ) were held in the fall of even-numbered years , and then in December the “ lame duck ” Congress would reassemble for a final session ending on March 4 . The term of the new Congress ( and , when applicable , the new president ) began on March 4 , though Congress usually did not assemble ( except for a brief Senate session to confirm presidential appointees ) until December .
There were no partisan confrontations over the Court in this period , partly due to the Founding generation ’ s uneasy relationship with open partisanship and partly because the Senate was always under the control of the same party or faction as the president . The First Congress was sufficiently idealistic about nonpartisanship to create a Supreme Court with an even number of justices ( six ; Washington nominated seven justices in 1789–90 because one of them declined to serve after being confirmed ) . The Democrats would add a seventh justice to the roster in the seventh year of Jefferson ’ s term . Of the 22 nominees who were voted on by the Senate between 1789 and 1823 , 19 were confirmed unanimously or by voice vote , and one ( an election-year nominee in 1796 ) was confirmed 21–1 . * * That said , the Senate did reject one of Washington ’ s nominees , a recess appointment to be chief justice ( over his opposition to Washington ’ s own foreign policy ) , and one of James Madison ’ s ( mainly over his enforcement of an unpopular embargo ) .
Four nominees were confirmed in the last year of a presidential term , in each case by a Senate dominated by the president ’ s own party ( two at the end of Washington ’ s second term , one for John Adams , one for Jefferson at the end of his first term ) . And one of those was both highly controversial and highly consequential ; the lame-duck Federalist-controlled Senate , by voice vote , confirmed John Marshall to be chief justice in January 1801 , after both Adams and the Senate majority had been voted out of office . Marshall would go on to rule , indirectly , on the propriety of Adams ’ s “ midnight judges ” in Marbury v. Madison , and would remain on the Court for three and a half decades , long outliving the Federalist party . Marshall ’ s career illustrated to the political branches the power of Supreme Court nominations .
The nation ’ s second two-party system emerged during John Quincy Adams ’ s presidency , as parties coalesced around Adams ( later called the Whigs ) and Andrew Jackson ( later called the Democrats ) . * * * The story of the period from 1826 to 1841 was the Jacksonian faction ’ s partisan struggle to take control of the Court .
Adams had been elected by the House of Representatives after no candidate won a majority of the electoral votes in 1824 , and his opponents charged that he had gained the presidency through a “ corrupt bargain ” with Henry Clay . While the Jacksonians were bent on delegitimizing Adams , he still got his first Supreme Court nominee , Robert Trimble , confirmed by a Jacksonian Senate in 1826 . However , after Adams lost the 1828 election to Jackson , his lame-duck nomination of Robert Crittenden in December 1828 ( to replace Trimble , who had died suddenly in August ) was tabled by the Senate . The Jacksonians had no intention of allowing another Adams to appoint another midnight justice . Jackson nominated Trimble ’ s replacement two days into his term , and he was confirmed the next day .
Jackson ran into his own Senate roadblock when he sent two nominees to the Whig-controlled Senate in January 1835 , and one of them ( Roger Taney ) was — like Crittenden — tabled by the Senate without a formal up-or-down vote on the nomination . But the Democrats had won back the Senate in the 1834 elections , so when John Marshall died the following summer , Jackson filled the original vacancy with another nominee and got Taney confirmed to be chief justice .
The Jacksonians weren ’ t done stocking the Court : On Jackson ’ s last day in office , they passed the Eighth and Ninth Circuits Act , expanding the Court from seven justices to nine , and Jackson nominated two new justices , who were confirmed by the incoming Senate ( which remained in Democratic hands , as did the presidency ) five days later . One of the nominees declined , and his successor was selected by Jackson ’ s successor , Martin Van Buren . Van Buren , in turn , had the help of a Democrat-controlled Senate in confirming his own lame-duck midnight justice , Peter Daniel , in February 1841 after losing his attempt at reelection in 1840 .
No sooner had the Jacksonians established the principle that control of the Supreme Court belonged to the parties than two vacancies fell into the hands of a president who had no base of support in any party .
John Tyler , the first vice president to become president , was a recent convert from the Democrats to the Whigs . He was expelled by the Whig party ( controlled by Henry Clay , who had presidential ambitions ) not long after he became president , leaving him with no party base in Congress . Two Supreme Court vacancies opened near the end of his single term , one in December 1843 , the other in April 1844 . After a combined eight nominations and renominations of four candidates over 13 months , he was finally able to fill the first vacancy by nominating a Democrat after James K. Polk and his fellow Jacksonian Democrats won the 1844 elections . Tyler failed twice on the other vacancy , so it was held open for President Polk ( whose first choice was also rejected ) .
A similar fate to Tyler ’ s befell Millard Fillmore , another “ accidental ” Whig president , who had three nominees shot down by the Democrat-controlled Senate for a vacancy that opened in July 1852 . That vacancy was held open for the next president , Democrat Franklin Pierce , who promptly filled it . Another Democratic appointment followed in 1857 , when the sole Whig-appointed justice , Benjamin Curtis , resigned in protest over Chief Justice Taney ’ s opinion in Dred Scott v. Sandford . By this point the Whig party was a thing of the past .
James Buchanan had a second vacancy open in May of the election year of 1860 , and unwisely waited until February to fill it . By that time the Senate had tipped to the Republicans after Southern Democrats withdrew to join the Confederacy . Republican senators , by a 26–25 vote , held the seat open to be filled by Abraham Lincoln , the first Republican president . President Lincoln would go on , with the help of a Republican Senate , to fill five Supreme Court seats , including one that had been newly created .
In the aftermath of the Civil War , the pro-Reconstruction “ Radical Republicans ” took the most extreme step ever taken by the Senate to prevent a president from nominating Supreme Court justices . When Lincoln was assassinated in April 1865 , the Court consisted of ten justices , five of them Lincoln appointees . Lincoln ’ s successor , Andrew Johnson , was a Union loyalist but still a Southern Democrat at heart , weak on Reconstruction and mistrusted by the Radical Republicans who ran Congress . So when Justice John Catron died in May 1865 and Justice James Wayne died in July 1867 — both Andrew Jackson appointees — the Senate refused to consider any Johnson appointees to the Court . Henry Stanbery , nominated in April 1866 to replace Catron , was never voted on by the Senate .
Instead , Senate Republicans passed the Judicial Circuits Act of 1866 , which Johnson signed into law in July . Under its terms , the Court would be reduced by attrition from ten justices to seven . The act wasn ’ t motivated entirely by obstruction — Chief Justice Chase supported it as a way to raise the justices ’ pay — but after Republican Ulysses S. Grant was elected in 1868 , Congress the following April passed the Circuit Judges Act , which restored the Court to nine justices ( where it has stayed ever since ) and gave President Grant an immediate appointment .
Intraparty battles provided much of the remaining drama between 1868 and 1896 . Senate Republicans rejected three of President Grant ’ s nominees and Senate Democrats rejected two of Grover Cleveland ’ s . In terms of bipartisan norms , however , there were five interesting nominations in this period :
‐William Woods was nominated by lame-duck Republican Rutherford B. Hayes in December 1880 and confirmed by the outgoing Democrat-controlled Senate . The Republicans had just won the 1880 presidential election behind James Garfield , and had gained enough Senate seats that the new Senate would be evenly deadlocked . Woods ’ s easy 39–8 confirmation suggests that the Democrats felt he was the best deal they could get , since Woods lived in Alabama and had been a Democrat before serving the Union in the Civil War . If they had rejected him , Garfield might have nominated someone less acceptable .
‐A month later , Hayes sent the new Senate another nominee , Stanley Matthews . The Senate ignored Hayes this time , but Matthews was renominated by Garfield and confirmed by a one-vote margin , 24–23 , the only justice to be confirmed by just one vote . The Matthews nomination fight would mark the first appearance of what is now a fixture , outside interest groups lobbying against the nominee .
‐In December 1887 , seven months after a vacancy opened on the Court , Cleveland ( the first Democratic president since before the war ) nominated Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar , a respected former senator but also a former Confederate official . Lamar faced stiff opposition in the Republican-controlled Senate but was confirmed in January , 32–28 .
‐In April 1888 , seven months before losing his reelection bid , Cleveland made another nomination , of Melville Fuller to be chief justice . Fuller was the only historical precedent for the confirmation of a nominee in Garland ’ s position : an outgoing Democrat nominated him in the teeth of a hostile Republican Senate . He was a partisan Democrat , having managed Stephen Douglas ’ s presidential campaign against Lincoln in 1860 . But he also arrived at a point of unique , non-ideological crisis for the Court , when it was choked with a multi-year backlog in resolving the cases on its docket . Fuller , as a veteran Supreme Court advocate was well-positioned to play Mr. Fixit . ( In office , Fuller would be instrumental in getting Congress to expand the federal appeals courts to relieve this burden and create the modern Supreme Court ’ s power over what cases it takes . ) Despite fierce criticism from members of the 38–37 Republican majority ( along with one Republican-leaning independent ) , Fuller was confirmed , 41–20 , with nine Republican votes . He went on to lead the Court through a period of rising professionalism but also its notorious decisions in Plessy v. Ferguson and Lochner v. New York .
‐In February 1893 , lame-duck Republican president Benjamin Harrison — having been ousted by Cleveland , and only a few weeks from leaving office — nominated Howell Jackson , who was confirmed by the lame-duck Republican Senate by voice vote . Jackson , however , was a Democrat — he had served in the Senate as a Democrat , had fought for the Confederacy , and had been appointed to the Sixth Circuit by Cleveland . The Jackson nomination was thus a concession of Republican power in the lame-duck session , not an assertion . It would not be the last time a weakened president reached for the bipartisan olive branch .
In short , durable norms of behavior of any kind are hard to identify in this period , from either the White House or the Senate . Confirmation fights were hotly contested , some nominees never got a vote , and presidents who were dealing from a position of weakness tended to choose nominees who would be acceptable to the opposing party .
The Senate ’ s general lack of deference to Supreme Court nominees in the late 19th century was consistent with the weak presidencies of that era , as well as the view of justices as political actors — hence the tendency to appoint senators and Cabinet members to the Court ( not until 1941 would we have a chief justice who had not previously been an elected official ) .
After 1896 , things changed . Only one of 22 Supreme Court nominations was rejected between 1897 and 1932 . With the arrival of more intellectual justices like Holmes and Brandeis , the Court gradually acquired more prestige and less obvious partisanship in this period , during which ( not coincidentally ) the Court rarely clashed with the political branches of the federal government . Of perhaps equal importance , after the Fuller nomination in 1888 , there would not be another Supreme Court nomination until the 1950s by a president whose party did not also control the Senate .
Sixteen of the twenty-two nominations in this period were made in the ideal conditions : the first two years of a presidential term , with a Senate controlled by the president ’ s party . Fifteen of the sixteen were confirmed with nearly no opposition ; the sole exception , Hoover nominee John J. Parker in 1930 , was narrowly defeated with significant opposition from Republican senators ( due to racist remarks and anti-labor judicial decisions ) . The two nominations in the third year of a presidency ( one of them in January , the other in February ) were likewise easily confirmed .
But even in an era of few confirmation fights , there was still some resistance to election-year nominees . Two of the four ( Mahlon Pitney and Louis Brandeis in 1912 and 1916 , respectively ) garnered significant votes in opposition , and in 1932 , a weakened Herbert Hoover abandoned his party to nominate Benjamin Cardozo , a New York Democrat of impeccable liberal credentials , in the midst of a presidential campaign against the Democratic governor of New York , Franklin D. Roosevelt . As with Howell Jackson and Samuel Nelson , Cardozo ’ s election-year confirmation represented a presidential concession .
President Roosevelt ’ s “ Court-packing plan ” of 1937 was unsuccessful , in part , because the idea of the Court as a prestigious , independent , professional institution had firmly established itself in the American mind . That prestige may have helped create — for a time — a more deferential confirmation system , in which both presidents and senators pretended to higher ideals than simple partisan control . And at times they meant it : presidents Taft ( twice ) , Harding , and Truman all appointed justices of the opposite party when they didn ’ t really need to . The same was true of FDR ’ s decision to elevate Republican Harlan Fiske Stone to chief justice in June 1941 , although Roosevelt , like Lincoln with his appointment of Democratic justice Stephen Field , probably had his eye on wartime unity .
Every nominee to the Supreme Court in this period was ultimately confirmed . Among them was Earl Warren , the only Supreme Court justice nominated by a Republican president and confirmed by a Republican Senate between Cardozo in 1932 and Sandra Day O ’ Connor in 1981 .
There were two election-year nominations in this period . One , Frank Murphy in 1940 , was a traditional spoils-system nomination , as Senate Democrats had the votes ( with a 69–23 majority ) to ram through a liberal FDR nominee . The other was Brennan , a recess appointment made by Eisenhower three weeks before the 1956 election ( as a Catholic New Jersey Democrat , he represented three constituencies that Ike was courting for the election ) . Lyndon Johnson ’ s Democratic majority supported Brennan unanimously , and he would go on to be the most consequential liberal justice in the Court ’ s history . Eisenhower is the only president since Theodore Roosevelt to make recess appointments to the Court ; he also used that route to seat Warren and Potter Stewart .
Brown v. Board of Education marked the Court ’ s shift from the economic-policy fights of the New Deal era and the foreign-policy battles of the 1940s to the more incendiary area of social issues . That trend would escalate dramatically in the 1960s , as the Court moved into areas like school prayer , contraception , and pornography . While the Court in prior eras had been downstream of partisan politics , reflecting the political actors who appointed and confirmed its members , the Court since the Warren era has often been a cause of voters ’ partisan alignments . This change has strained the system of norms governing the confirmation process .
The successful filibuster of Abe Fortas ’ s election-year nomination for promotion to chief justice in 1968 was a watershed . Fortas ’ s elevation , and the corresponding nomination of LBJ ’ s Texas crony Homer Thornberry to fill Fortas ’ s old seat , was opposed by a bipartisan alliance of 24 Republicans and 19 mostly Southern Democrats in the Democrat-controlled Senate . Most of the objectors were opponents of the Warren Court ’ s liberalism , but they had other serious concerns : the ethical lapses that would ultimately force Fortas ’ s resignation from the Court ; the cronyist coziness between LBJ , Fortas ( who was accused of helping the Johnson administration draft legislation while on the Court ) , and Thornberry ( who had taken over LBJ ’ s old House seat ) ; and the apparent collusion between Warren and LBJ in arranging the timing of his retirement and his replacements .
The defeats of Fortas and Thornberry left the replacement of Warren in Nixon ’ s hands , and a second vacancy arose when Fortas resigned . But while Nixon got Warren Burger confirmed without incident to replace Warren , Senate Democrats voted down Nixon ’ s first two choices to replace Fortas , both conservative , before he settled on Harry Blackmun , a moderate who moved steadily leftward during his time on the Court .
No nominee since Fortas and Thornberry has been formally filibustered , although some Democrats made attempts with William Rehnquist ’ s elevation to chief justice and later with Samuel Alito . Obama ’ s nomination of Merrick Garland , by contrast , was simply ignored by the Senate , without even a hearing .
After Scalia , no conservative has been confirmed with anything like unanimous support ; after Stephen Breyer , no liberal has , either . The open entry of ideology into the confirmation process was heralded by Biden in the fight over Rehnquist ’ s nomination for chief justice and deployed ruthlessly in the following year ’ s fight against Robert Bork , which , like the 1971 fight against Nixon ’ s nominees , ultimately resulted in the nomination of a more socially liberal justice ( Anthony Kennedy ) .
The Senate filibuster against legislation exists for good and valid reasons as a sobriety checkpoint for federal legislation . The 2013 abolition of the filibuster for executive nominations is likewise a welcome development , as executive appointees are merely an extension of the president and should not be defeated over mere differences with the executive branch .
But Supreme Court nominations exist in a gray area , and the importance and permanence of Supreme Court decisions drives each side to disregard norms and act to the greatest extent of its power . Lacking , for now , a workable mechanism to compel both sides to play by the same rules , there is only politics and tradition .
That tradition shows that election-year nominations really are different . Senate Republicans , in stopping the Garland nomination , may have used different tools than past Senate majorities , but they acted in accordance with the dominant Senate tradition in election-year nominations since 1828 , and did not “ steal ” a Supreme Court seat . If Democrats want to break the process further by filibustering Gorsuch , they should be denied the fig leaf of claiming that the Garland precedent supports such a step .
* My tally of nominations does not count a couple of nominations ( Pierce Butler , William Hornblower ) that were sent twice by the same president to the same Senate without any intervening action . It also doesn ’ t count nominees who publicly declined their nominations before they were submitted ( one of whom , John Quincy Adams , later became president ) . I also ignored John Roberts ’ nomination to succeed Justice O ’ Connor , which was withdrawn when Chief Justice Rehnquist died and Roberts was renominated to be chief justice instead .
* * One of Washington ’ s nominees , William Paterson , was withdrawn and resubmitted because he had been a sitting senator when the Court was created , and thus needed under the Constitution to wait for an intervening election . I ’ ve counted him as a failure and resubmitted nominee .
* * * For simplicity , I classify John Quincy Adams and his party as the Whigs and Jackson and his party going back to Jefferson as the Democrats , although in each case , the party labels were not used regularly until later .
Correction : This article originally identified the Senate that confirmed Rufus Peckham ( an appointment by Democratic president Grover Cleveland ) by voice vote in December 1895 as Democrat-controlled . In fact , while neither party had a majority due to six senators from the Populist and Silver parties , the 54th Congress opened in March 1895 with a 42-39 Republican plurality , and Republicans controlled the chamber in December . The chart referencing Peckham has been updated . Since Peckham ( best known as the author of the pro-business Lochner v. New York decision ) was neither nominated nor confirmed in a presidential election year , this does not affect the rest of the article .","Neil Gorsuch arrives for his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill (Reuters: Jim Bourg)

Election-year Supreme Court nominations are always governed by partisan concerns.

Neil Gorsuch is a careful judge, a lively writer, and a brilliant legal scholar. He’s received the highest possible rating from the left-leaning American Bar Association and the support of a number of liberals who have worked with him over the years. There’s nothing bad you can say about Gorsuch as a Supreme Court nominee.

Nothing, that is, except that Gorsuch is (1) a conservative who (2) was nominated by Donald Trump to (3) fill the same seat as Merrick Garland, the Obama nominee to whom Senate Republicans refused to give a vote, or even a hearing. Arch-partisan Democrats regard the seat vacated by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia as stolen, and Trump’s election as illegitimate, and they think these are reasons enough to vote against any Trump nominee to replace Scalia. As a result, the Gorsuch nomination will largely be a proxy fight over the legitimacy of the Senate’s rejection of the Garland nomination.

The Supreme Court confirmation process has been badly broken over the past three decades, and both parties have had a role in that. But the Garland nomination was a rare event in the modern Senate, because he was nominated in a presidential-election year by a president whose party did not control the Senate. Only once in U.S. history (in 1888) has the Senate acted before Election Day to confirm a justice who was nominated in the last year of a presidential term by a president of the opposing party. Three others (in 1845, 1880, and 1957) were confirmed only after the election:

‐In February 1845, outgoing president John Tyler (elected as a Whig but by then a man without a party) had nominations pending for two open seats. The Democrats had won control of both the presidency and the Senate in the 1844 elections. The lame-duck Whig Senate confirmed one of Tyler’s two nominees (Samuel Nelson, a Democrat, Tyler’s sixth nomination for that seat in 13 months), and left the other seat open for the incoming president after rejecting three efforts by Tyler to fill it.

‐In December 1880, a vacancy opened after Election Day. Republicans had won the presidential election as well as enough Senate seats to deadlock the Senate. The lame-duck Democratic Senate confirmed William Woods, a Republican nominated by outgoing Republican president Rutherford B. Hayes, but when a second vacancy opened in January, they left that seat open for the incoming president (James Garfield, another Republican).

‐In October 1956, Republican president Dwight Eisenhower made a recess appointment of William Brennan, a liberal Democrat. Eisenhower went on to win a landslide reelection, and in January, the Democratic Senate confirmed Brennan.

By contrast, the Scalia vacancy was the seventh time that the Senate has held a Supreme Court vacancy open rather than confirm an election-year nominee. Besides Obama, and the Tyler and Hayes cases mentioned above, this happened to John Quincy Adams, Millard Fillmore, James Buchanan, and Lyndon Johnson. In all these cases but Hayes’s, the failure to confirm meant that a president of a different party would make the nomination; in all but LBJ’s and Tyler’s, the incoming president would be from the same party that controlled the outgoing Senate. The Republican Congress went even further when Andrew Johnson was president: It eliminated Supreme Court seats as they became vacant, then restored them to be filled by the next Republican president. Johnson had made one nomination to a vacant seat, but the new law nullified it.

By contrast, nine election-year nominees and five post–Election Day nominees have been confirmed by the Senate when its majority was of the same party as the president. Only one president, Lyndon Johnson, has had a nominee rejected in this situation. In other words, as you’d expect, election-year nominations to the Court have usually been resolved on sharply partisan lines. So the Senate’s refusal to act on Garland is well within historical norms, and any Democratic effort to obstruct Gorsuch as payback would break new ground and possibly trigger the end of the judicial filibuster in its entirety.

A Historical Scorecard

The Supreme Court confirmation process is a subject of continuing controversy because it has historically been governed mainly by precedents and norms of behavior, not by rules. The Constitution establishes only two rules: The president “shall nominate” justices, “and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint” them. A third rule is established by the Senate itself: The Senate can’t proceed to vote on a nomination until debate has ended. The relevant rule has been changed four times, each time by a Democratic majority. In 1917, cloture was introduced for legislative debates, allowing a two-thirds vote to end debate (before then, there was no mechanism to stop even a single senator from filibustering indefinitely). In 1949, the cloture rule was extended from legislative debates to nominations. In 1975, the majority needed for cloture was dropped from two-thirds to three-fifths. And in 2013, the filibuster was abolished for all judicial and executive nomination votes except for Supreme Court justices. Yet while Senate minorities have zealously guarded their power to filibuster Supreme Court nominees, that power has been used to stop a nomination only once, in 1968. Every other time a nomination has been tabled or defeated, it has been done by the action of the majority party and/or a voting majority of senators.

Consider the varying methods by which nominations have failed to end in confirmation after being transmitted to the Senate (failed nominees in purple on this table were for seats that were eventually filled by a president from a different party):

The procedural devices vary here, and the details of some Senate floor actions are lost to history (I use “NR” where vote totals on Senate motions were not recorded and “NA” where no vote was taken, but I list Garland as being opposed 54–46 because no senator in either party publicly broke ranks on confirming him). Of the 35 failed nominations (including the repeat nominations by John Tyler), twelve received an up-or-down confirmation vote, six were withdrawn without a vote being taken, 13 were defeated by some other Senate action requiring a vote, and four (including Garland) were allowed to expire.

Senate norms for confirming Supreme Court justices have changed over time, but there’s never been a norm in favor of approving a nomination like Garland’s. To see how norms have developed in this area, let’s review the history of all Supreme Court nominations sent to the Senate*, broken down by time period.

1789–1823: Unity

As was true of many aspects of American politics, the degree of partisanship in Supreme Court nominations varied widely in the Republic’s early days. Below is a list of all the nominees from 1789 to 1823; the time from the vacancy, nomination, and confirmation or rejection to the next presidential election; the party of the president, the nominee, and the Senate majority; the percentage of votes cast (where available) against each nominee; and the ultimate disposition of the nomination. Orange refers to nominations made the year before the end of a presidential term, green to ones made in the final year, and purple to lame-duck nominations.

Congress’s sessions tended to be fairly brief in the early years, which explains why there were so many recess appointments in this period.

The next table provides a more granular look at the dates during the year when each nomination occurred. “Since Nom” is the time (in days) from nomination to resolution (confirmation or rejection/withdrawal), and “Since Vac” is the time to those points from the original vacancy. In considering lame-duck nominations, bear in mind that before the 20th Amendment was enacted in 1933, elections for a new Congress (and, when applicable, a president) were held in the fall of even-numbered years, and then in December the “lame duck” Congress would reassemble for a final session ending on March 4. The term of the new Congress (and, when applicable, the new president) began on March 4, though Congress usually did not assemble (except for a brief Senate session to confirm presidential appointees) until December.

There were no partisan confrontations over the Court in this period, partly due to the Founding generation’s uneasy relationship with open partisanship and partly because the Senate was always under the control of the same party or faction as the president. The First Congress was sufficiently idealistic about nonpartisanship to create a Supreme Court with an even number of justices (six; Washington nominated seven justices in 1789–90 because one of them declined to serve after being confirmed). The Democrats would add a seventh justice to the roster in the seventh year of Jefferson’s term. Of the 22 nominees who were voted on by the Senate between 1789 and 1823, 19 were confirmed unanimously or by voice vote, and one (an election-year nominee in 1796) was confirmed 21–1.** That said, the Senate did reject one of Washington’s nominees, a recess appointment to be chief justice (over his opposition to Washington’s own foreign policy), and one of James Madison’s (mainly over his enforcement of an unpopular embargo).

Four nominees were confirmed in the last year of a presidential term, in each case by a Senate dominated by the president’s own party (two at the end of Washington’s second term, one for John Adams, one for Jefferson at the end of his first term). And one of those was both highly controversial and highly consequential; the lame-duck Federalist-controlled Senate, by voice vote, confirmed John Marshall to be chief justice in January 1801, after both Adams and the Senate majority had been voted out of office. Marshall would go on to rule, indirectly, on the propriety of Adams’s “midnight judges” in Marbury v. Madison, and would remain on the Court for three and a half decades, long outliving the Federalist party. Marshall’s career illustrated to the political branches the power of Supreme Court nominations.

1826–1841: Spoils

The nation’s second two-party system emerged during John Quincy Adams’s presidency, as parties coalesced around Adams (later called the Whigs) and Andrew Jackson (later called the Democrats).*** The story of the period from 1826 to 1841 was the Jacksonian faction’s partisan struggle to take control of the Court.

Adams had been elected by the House of Representatives after no candidate won a majority of the electoral votes in 1824, and his opponents charged that he had gained the presidency through a “corrupt bargain” with Henry Clay. While the Jacksonians were bent on delegitimizing Adams, he still got his first Supreme Court nominee, Robert Trimble, confirmed by a Jacksonian Senate in 1826. However, after Adams lost the 1828 election to Jackson, his lame-duck nomination of Robert Crittenden in December 1828 (to replace Trimble, who had died suddenly in August) was tabled by the Senate. The Jacksonians had no intention of allowing another Adams to appoint another midnight justice. Jackson nominated Trimble’s replacement two days into his term, and he was confirmed the next day.

Jackson ran into his own Senate roadblock when he sent two nominees to the Whig-controlled Senate in January 1835, and one of them (Roger Taney) was — like Crittenden — tabled by the Senate without a formal up-or-down vote on the nomination. But the Democrats had won back the Senate in the 1834 elections, so when John Marshall died the following summer, Jackson filled the original vacancy with another nominee and got Taney confirmed to be chief justice.

The Jacksonians weren’t done stocking the Court: On Jackson’s last day in office, they passed the Eighth and Ninth Circuits Act, expanding the Court from seven justices to nine, and Jackson nominated two new justices, who were confirmed by the incoming Senate (which remained in Democratic hands, as did the presidency) five days later. One of the nominees declined, and his successor was selected by Jackson’s successor, Martin Van Buren. Van Buren, in turn, had the help of a Democrat-controlled Senate in confirming his own lame-duck midnight justice, Peter Daniel, in February 1841 after losing his attempt at reelection in 1840.

1844–1864: The Man without a Party

No sooner had the Jacksonians established the principle that control of the Supreme Court belonged to the parties than two vacancies fell into the hands of a president who had no base of support in any party.

John Tyler, the first vice president to become president, was a recent convert from the Democrats to the Whigs. He was expelled by the Whig party (controlled by Henry Clay, who had presidential ambitions) not long after he became president, leaving him with no party base in Congress. Two Supreme Court vacancies opened near the end of his single term, one in December 1843, the other in April 1844. After a combined eight nominations and renominations of four candidates over 13 months, he was finally able to fill the first vacancy by nominating a Democrat after James K. Polk and his fellow Jacksonian Democrats won the 1844 elections. Tyler failed twice on the other vacancy, so it was held open for President Polk (whose first choice was also rejected).

A similar fate to Tyler’s befell Millard Fillmore, another “accidental” Whig president, who had three nominees shot down by the Democrat-controlled Senate for a vacancy that opened in July 1852. That vacancy was held open for the next president, Democrat Franklin Pierce, who promptly filled it. Another Democratic appointment followed in 1857, when the sole Whig-appointed justice, Benjamin Curtis, resigned in protest over Chief Justice Taney’s opinion in Dred Scott v. Sandford. By this point the Whig party was a thing of the past.

James Buchanan had a second vacancy open in May of the election year of 1860, and unwisely waited until February to fill it. By that time the Senate had tipped to the Republicans after Southern Democrats withdrew to join the Confederacy. Republican senators, by a 26–25 vote, held the seat open to be filled by Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican president. President Lincoln would go on, with the help of a Republican Senate, to fill five Supreme Court seats, including one that had been newly created.

1865–1895: Power Struggle

In the aftermath of the Civil War, the pro-Reconstruction “Radical Republicans” took the most extreme step ever taken by the Senate to prevent a president from nominating Supreme Court justices. When Lincoln was assassinated in April 1865, the Court consisted of ten justices, five of them Lincoln appointees. Lincoln’s successor, Andrew Johnson, was a Union loyalist but still a Southern Democrat at heart, weak on Reconstruction and mistrusted by the Radical Republicans who ran Congress. So when Justice John Catron died in May 1865 and Justice James Wayne died in July 1867 — both Andrew Jackson appointees — the Senate refused to consider any Johnson appointees to the Court. Henry Stanbery, nominated in April 1866 to replace Catron, was never voted on by the Senate.

Instead, Senate Republicans passed the Judicial Circuits Act of 1866, which Johnson signed into law in July. Under its terms, the Court would be reduced by attrition from ten justices to seven. The act wasn’t motivated entirely by obstruction — Chief Justice Chase supported it as a way to raise the justices’ pay — but after Republican Ulysses S. Grant was elected in 1868, Congress the following April passed the Circuit Judges Act, which restored the Court to nine justices (where it has stayed ever since) and gave President Grant an immediate appointment.

Intraparty battles provided much of the remaining drama between 1868 and 1896. Senate Republicans rejected three of President Grant’s nominees and Senate Democrats rejected two of Grover Cleveland’s. In terms of bipartisan norms, however, there were five interesting nominations in this period:

‐William Woods was nominated by lame-duck Republican Rutherford B. Hayes in December 1880 and confirmed by the outgoing Democrat-controlled Senate. The Republicans had just won the 1880 presidential election behind James Garfield, and had gained enough Senate seats that the new Senate would be evenly deadlocked. Woods’s easy 39–8 confirmation suggests that the Democrats felt he was the best deal they could get, since Woods lived in Alabama and had been a Democrat before serving the Union in the Civil War. If they had rejected him, Garfield might have nominated someone less acceptable.

‐A month later, Hayes sent the new Senate another nominee, Stanley Matthews. The Senate ignored Hayes this time, but Matthews was renominated by Garfield and confirmed by a one-vote margin, 24–23, the only justice to be confirmed by just one vote. The Matthews nomination fight would mark the first appearance of what is now a fixture, outside interest groups lobbying against the nominee.

‐In December 1887, seven months after a vacancy opened on the Court, Cleveland (the first Democratic president since before the war) nominated Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar, a respected former senator but also a former Confederate official. Lamar faced stiff opposition in the Republican-controlled Senate but was confirmed in January, 32–28.

‐In April 1888, seven months before losing his reelection bid, Cleveland made another nomination, of Melville Fuller to be chief justice. Fuller was the only historical precedent for the confirmation of a nominee in Garland’s position: an outgoing Democrat nominated him in the teeth of a hostile Republican Senate. He was a partisan Democrat, having managed Stephen Douglas’s presidential campaign against Lincoln in 1860. But he also arrived at a point of unique, non-ideological crisis for the Court, when it was choked with a multi-year backlog in resolving the cases on its docket. Fuller, as a veteran Supreme Court advocate was well-positioned to play Mr. Fixit. (In office, Fuller would be instrumental in getting Congress to expand the federal appeals courts to relieve this burden and create the modern Supreme Court’s power over what cases it takes.) Despite fierce criticism from members of the 38–37 Republican majority (along with one Republican-leaning independent), Fuller was confirmed, 41–20, with nine Republican votes. He went on to lead the Court through a period of rising professionalism but also its notorious decisions in Plessy v. Ferguson and Lochner v. New York.

‐In February 1893, lame-duck Republican president Benjamin Harrison — having been ousted by Cleveland, and only a few weeks from leaving office — nominated Howell Jackson, who was confirmed by the lame-duck Republican Senate by voice vote. Jackson, however, was a Democrat — he had served in the Senate as a Democrat, had fought for the Confederacy, and had been appointed to the Sixth Circuit by Cleveland. The Jackson nomination was thus a concession of Republican power in the lame-duck session, not an assertion. It would not be the last time a weakened president reached for the bipartisan olive branch.

In short, durable norms of behavior of any kind are hard to identify in this period, from either the White House or the Senate. Confirmation fights were hotly contested, some nominees never got a vote, and presidents who were dealing from a position of weakness tended to choose nominees who would be acceptable to the opposing party.

1897–1932: De-escalating the Court

The Senate’s general lack of deference to Supreme Court nominees in the late 19th century was consistent with the weak presidencies of that era, as well as the view of justices as political actors — hence the tendency to appoint senators and Cabinet members to the Court (not until 1941 would we have a chief justice who had not previously been an elected official).

After 1896, things changed. Only one of 22 Supreme Court nominations was rejected between 1897 and 1932. With the arrival of more intellectual justices like Holmes and Brandeis, the Court gradually acquired more prestige and less obvious partisanship in this period, during which (not coincidentally) the Court rarely clashed with the political branches of the federal government. Of perhaps equal importance, after the Fuller nomination in 1888, there would not be another Supreme Court nomination until the 1950s by a president whose party did not also control the Senate.

Sixteen of the twenty-two nominations in this period were made in the ideal conditions: the first two years of a presidential term, with a Senate controlled by the president’s party. Fifteen of the sixteen were confirmed with nearly no opposition; the sole exception, Hoover nominee John J. Parker in 1930, was narrowly defeated with significant opposition from Republican senators (due to racist remarks and anti-labor judicial decisions). The two nominations in the third year of a presidency (one of them in January, the other in February) were likewise easily confirmed.

But even in an era of few confirmation fights, there was still some resistance to election-year nominees. Two of the four (Mahlon Pitney and Louis Brandeis in 1912 and 1916, respectively) garnered significant votes in opposition, and in 1932, a weakened Herbert Hoover abandoned his party to nominate Benjamin Cardozo, a New York Democrat of impeccable liberal credentials, in the midst of a presidential campaign against the Democratic governor of New York, Franklin D. Roosevelt. As with Howell Jackson and Samuel Nelson, Cardozo’s election-year confirmation represented a presidential concession.

1937–1967: Liberal Hegemony

President Roosevelt’s “Court-packing plan” of 1937 was unsuccessful, in part, because the idea of the Court as a prestigious, independent, professional institution had firmly established itself in the American mind. That prestige may have helped create — for a time — a more deferential confirmation system, in which both presidents and senators pretended to higher ideals than simple partisan control. And at times they meant it: presidents Taft (twice), Harding, and Truman all appointed justices of the opposite party when they didn’t really need to. The same was true of FDR’s decision to elevate Republican Harlan Fiske Stone to chief justice in June 1941, although Roosevelt, like Lincoln with his appointment of Democratic justice Stephen Field, probably had his eye on wartime unity.

Every nominee to the Supreme Court in this period was ultimately confirmed. Among them was Earl Warren, the only Supreme Court justice nominated by a Republican president and confirmed by a Republican Senate between Cardozo in 1932 and Sandra Day O’Connor in 1981.

There were two election-year nominations in this period. One, Frank Murphy in 1940, was a traditional spoils-system nomination, as Senate Democrats had the votes (with a 69–23 majority) to ram through a liberal FDR nominee. The other was Brennan, a recess appointment made by Eisenhower three weeks before the 1956 election (as a Catholic New Jersey Democrat, he represented three constituencies that Ike was courting for the election). Lyndon Johnson’s Democratic majority supported Brennan unanimously, and he would go on to be the most consequential liberal justice in the Court’s history. Eisenhower is the only president since Theodore Roosevelt to make recess appointments to the Court; he also used that route to seat Warren and Potter Stewart.

1968–2017: Consensus Frays

Brown v. Board of Education marked the Court’s shift from the economic-policy fights of the New Deal era and the foreign-policy battles of the 1940s to the more incendiary area of social issues. That trend would escalate dramatically in the 1960s, as the Court moved into areas like school prayer, contraception, and pornography. While the Court in prior eras had been downstream of partisan politics, reflecting the political actors who appointed and confirmed its members, the Court since the Warren era has often been a cause of voters’ partisan alignments. This change has strained the system of norms governing the confirmation process.

The successful filibuster of Abe Fortas’s election-year nomination for promotion to chief justice in 1968 was a watershed. Fortas’s elevation, and the corresponding nomination of LBJ’s Texas crony Homer Thornberry to fill Fortas’s old seat, was opposed by a bipartisan alliance of 24 Republicans and 19 mostly Southern Democrats in the Democrat-controlled Senate. Most of the objectors were opponents of the Warren Court’s liberalism, but they had other serious concerns: the ethical lapses that would ultimately force Fortas’s resignation from the Court; the cronyist coziness between LBJ, Fortas (who was accused of helping the Johnson administration draft legislation while on the Court), and Thornberry (who had taken over LBJ’s old House seat); and the apparent collusion between Warren and LBJ in arranging the timing of his retirement and his replacements.

The defeats of Fortas and Thornberry left the replacement of Warren in Nixon’s hands, and a second vacancy arose when Fortas resigned. But while Nixon got Warren Burger confirmed without incident to replace Warren, Senate Democrats voted down Nixon’s first two choices to replace Fortas, both conservative, before he settled on Harry Blackmun, a moderate who moved steadily leftward during his time on the Court.

No nominee since Fortas and Thornberry has been formally filibustered, although some Democrats made attempts with William Rehnquist’s elevation to chief justice and later with Samuel Alito. Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland, by contrast, was simply ignored by the Senate, without even a hearing.

After Scalia, no conservative has been confirmed with anything like unanimous support; after Stephen Breyer, no liberal has, either. The open entry of ideology into the confirmation process was heralded by Biden in the fight over Rehnquist’s nomination for chief justice and deployed ruthlessly in the following year’s fight against Robert Bork, which, like the 1971 fight against Nixon’s nominees, ultimately resulted in the nomination of a more socially liberal justice (Anthony Kennedy).

The Broken System

The Senate filibuster against legislation exists for good and valid reasons as a sobriety checkpoint for federal legislation. The 2013 abolition of the filibuster for executive nominations is likewise a welcome development, as executive appointees are merely an extension of the president and should not be defeated over mere differences with the executive branch.

But Supreme Court nominations exist in a gray area, and the importance and permanence of Supreme Court decisions drives each side to disregard norms and act to the greatest extent of its power. Lacking, for now, a workable mechanism to compel both sides to play by the same rules, there is only politics and tradition.

That tradition shows that election-year nominations really are different. Senate Republicans, in stopping the Garland nomination, may have used different tools than past Senate majorities, but they acted in accordance with the dominant Senate tradition in election-year nominations since 1828, and did not “steal” a Supreme Court seat. If Democrats want to break the process further by filibustering Gorsuch, they should be denied the fig leaf of claiming that the Garland precedent supports such a step.

* My tally of nominations does not count a couple of nominations (Pierce Butler, William Hornblower) that were sent twice by the same president to the same Senate without any intervening action. It also doesn’t count nominees who publicly declined their nominations before they were submitted (one of whom, John Quincy Adams, later became president). I also ignored John Roberts’ nomination to succeed Justice O’Connor, which was withdrawn when Chief Justice Rehnquist died and Roberts was renominated to be chief justice instead.

** One of Washington’s nominees, William Paterson, was withdrawn and resubmitted because he had been a sitting senator when the Court was created, and thus needed under the Constitution to wait for an intervening election. I’ve counted him as a failure and resubmitted nominee.

*** For simplicity, I classify John Quincy Adams and his party as the Whigs and Jackson and his party going back to Jefferson as the Democrats, although in each case, the party labels were not used regularly until later.

Correction: This article originally identified the Senate that confirmed Rufus Peckham (an appointment by Democratic president Grover Cleveland) by voice vote in December 1895 as Democrat-controlled. In fact, while neither party had a majority due to six senators from the Populist and Silver parties, the 54th Congress opened in March 1895 with a 42-39 Republican plurality, and Republicans controlled the chamber in December. The chart referencing Peckham has been updated. Since Peckham (best known as the author of the pro-business Lochner v. New York decision) was neither nominated nor confirmed in a presidential election year, this does not affect the rest of the article.",www.nationalreview.com,right,KHvLSgxTGWUMJSMu

Risks for all three branches

In a stalemate between the White House and Congress, they could refuse to release them or hand them over.

Trump's lawyers say it's a fishing expedition to see if the president is guilty of tax fraud or money laundering.

All three branches of government have much at stake:

• The political earthquake that some justices may be seeking to sidestep would be most acutely felt if the president loses and the documents are made public during his reelection campaign. For nearly five years since declaring his candidacy in 2015, Trump has managed to keep his tax returns and much of his financial data from prying eyes.

The justices granted a request from the Trump administration to block a federal appeals court decision that , according to the Justice Department , would have allowed up to 24,000 additional refugees to enter the United States than would otherwise have been eligible .
The Supreme Court ruling gives Trump a partial victory as the high court prepares for a key October hearing on the constitutionality of Trump ’ s controversial executive order , which banned travelers from six Muslim-majority countries and limited refugee admissions .
The March 6 order suspended travel for people from Iran , Libya , Somalia , Sudan , Syria and Yemen for 90 days and locked out most aspiring refugees for 120 days in a move the Republican president argued was needed to prevent terrorist attacks and allow the government to put in place more stringent vetting procedures .
The order took effect in late June , following a Supreme Court ruling that narrowed the scope of lower court rulings .
In a ruling last week , the 9th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals said grandparents , aunts , uncles and cousins of legal U.S. residents would be exempt from the travel ban .
The Justice Department opted not to appeal that part of the 9th Circuit decision .
However , the 9th Circuit also ruled that Trump ’ s refugee policy was too broad , and the court allowed entry to refugees from around the world if they had a formal offer from a resettlement agency .
The Justice Department appealed , and the full Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with the administration in a one-sentence order .
Naureen Shah , Amnesty International USA ’ s senior director of campaigns , said the refugee ban is inherently cruel .
“ The Supreme Court today has dealt yet another devastating blow to vulnerable people who were on the cusp of obtaining safety for themselves and their families , ” she said . “ They continue to be subjected to unimaginable violence and fear while their lives are in limbo . ”
Earlier on Tuesday the state of Hawaii , which challenged the policy , said in a court filing that the U.S. government could still “ bar tens of thousands of refugees from entering the country. ” All the 9th Circuit ruling did is “ protect vulnerable refugees and the American entities that have been eagerly preparing to welcome them to our shores , ” Hawaii ’ s lawyers added .

The justices granted a request from the Trump administration to block a federal appeals court decision that, according to the Justice Department, would have allowed up to 24,000 additional refugees to enter the United States than would otherwise have been eligible.

The Supreme Court ruling gives Trump a partial victory as the high court prepares for a key October hearing on the constitutionality of Trump’s controversial executive order, which banned travelers from six Muslim-majority countries and limited refugee admissions.

The March 6 order suspended travel for people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days and locked out most aspiring refugees for 120 days in a move the Republican president argued was needed to prevent terrorist attacks and allow the government to put in place more stringent vetting procedures.

The order took effect in late June, following a Supreme Court ruling that narrowed the scope of lower court rulings.

In a ruling last week, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins of legal U.S. residents would be exempt from the travel ban.

The Justice Department opted not to appeal that part of the 9th Circuit decision.

However, the 9th Circuit also ruled that Trump’s refugee policy was too broad, and the court allowed entry to refugees from around the world if they had a formal offer from a resettlement agency.

The Justice Department appealed, and the full Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with the administration in a one-sentence order.

Naureen Shah, Amnesty International USA’s senior director of campaigns, said the refugee ban is inherently cruel.

“The Supreme Court today has dealt yet another devastating blow to vulnerable people who were on the cusp of obtaining safety for themselves and their families,” she said. “They continue to be subjected to unimaginable violence and fear while their lives are in limbo.”

Earlier on Tuesday the state of Hawaii, which challenged the policy, said in a court filing that the U.S. government could still “bar tens of thousands of refugees from entering the country.” All the 9th Circuit ruling did is “protect vulnerable refugees and the American entities that have been eagerly preparing to welcome them to our shores,” Hawaii’s lawyers added.

supreme_court,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jun/25/supreme-court-strikes-down-bulk-ariz-immigration-l/,Supreme Court upholds key plank of Arizona immigration law ,2012-06-25,Stephen Dinan,"The Supreme Court on Monday struck down most of Arizona ’ s tough immigration law as an unlawful infringement on federal power , but it upheld the most important plank , which allows police to stop and question the immigration status of those they suspect are in the country illegally .
Arizona ’ s governor said she ’ ll move quickly to begin enforcing that part of the law , even as the rest of it lies on the cutting floor .
In the complex 5-3 ruling , all eight justices said Arizona police can continue to question the legal status of those they stop , but the five-justice majority struck down the parts of the law in which Arizona sought to impose its own criminal penalties for immigration violations , with the majority saying that that power is reserved exclusively to the federal government .
The decision comes little more than a week after Mr. Obama announced he would stop deporting most young adult illegal immigrants , and coupled with the ruling , it marks a seismic shift in the national immigration debate .
Writing for the majority , Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said states can not try to act in an area in which the Constitution specifically grants powers to Congress — in this case , Article I , Section 8 , Clause 4 , which says Congress has powers over naturalization . That long has been interpreted to mean only the federal government can set immigration policy unless it specifically invites states to play a role .
“ Arizona may have under­standable frustrations with the problems caused by illegal immigration while that process continues , but the state may not pursue policies that undermine federal law , ” Justice Kennedy wrote .
He was joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Sonia Sotomayer , Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer .
Justices Antonin Scalia , Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. each wrote dissents .
All eight justices ruled that Arizona law enforcement can question those they stop about their legal status , but the three dissenting justices said the state should have been allowed to enact its own penalties for immigration violations as well .
Justice Scalia said the question at the founding of the country was not whether states had power to exclude people , but rather whether the federal government had that power as well .
“ Arizona is entitled to have ‘ its own immigration policy ’ — including a more rigorous enforcement policy — so long as that does not conflict with federal law , ” he wrote .
Arizona Gov . Jan Brewer , a Republican , signed the law in 2010 , saying her state needed to act because the federal government wasn ’ t doing its job .
Her signature on the bill , known as SB 1070 , instantly ignited a national debate about Mr. Obama ’ s policy at the federal level , which increasingly had tilted away from deporting rank-and-file illegal immigrants .
Mrs . Brewer said the decision was “ a victory for the rule of law ” and said she ’ ll move forward with the new authorities for police — saying police in her state are prepared to enforce it fairly .
“ After more than two years of legal challenges , the heart of SB 1070 can now be implemented in accordance with the U.S. Constitution , ” she said .
The law required police to check immigration status of those they encountered whom they had reasonable suspicion were in the country illegally , and required that they contact federal immigration authorities to give them a chance to put the individuals in deportation proceedings .
The law also imposed state penalties on illegal immigrants who applied for jobs .
The Obama administration sued and lower courts stayed both of those parts of the law , and Mrs . Brewer appealed .
In the intervening two years a handful of other states moved ahead with their own crackdown laws , while other localities actually went the other direction to codify so-called sanctuary-city policies that discouraged police from reporting illegal immigrants to federal authorities .
Mr. Obama ’ s administration sued to stop the state crackdown laws but has not taken action against the sanctuary city policies .
During the debate over SB 1070 , Mr. Obama and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. both criticized the law as opening up the chance for racial profiling . But when they sued , they didn ’ t make that argument , instead confining their challenge to issues of federal versus state power .
The racial profiling challenge could still come later , though , as the law begins to be enforced — something Mrs . Brewer said she expects .
“ Our critics are already preparing new litigation tactics in response to their loss at the Supreme Court , and undoubtedly will allege inequities in the implementation of the law , ” she said . “ As I said two years ago on the day I signed SB 1070 into law : ‘ We can not give them that chance . We must use this new tool wisely , and fight for our safety with the honor Arizona deserves . ’ ”
Last week Mrs . Brewer issued an executive order asking that training materials be distributed to all police to refresh them on what constitutes reasonable suspicion for a stop . Race or ethnicity alone is not enough to meet the threshold .
Still to be seen is whether Thursday ’ s ruling opens the floodgates on other states to follow suit .
In 2011 the court upheld an earlier Arizona law that required all businesses in the state to use E-Verify , the voluntary electronic system the federal government makes available for businesses to make sure their new hires are legal workers .
After Arizona , a series of other states passed similar E-Verify laws , but that pace slackened in 2012 , according to a study by ImmigrationWorks USA , which pushes for a broad national legalization solution to illegal immigration .
Sen. Charles E. Schumer , New York Democrat and chairman of the Senate ’ s subcommittee overseeing immigration , said before the Supreme Court ’ s oral arguments in April that he would try to pass a law undoing both this year ’ s decision and a 2010 ruling by the court that allowed states to require businesses to use E-Verify , the electronic worker verification system .","The Supreme Court on Monday struck down most of Arizona’s tough immigration law as an unlawful infringement on federal power, but it upheld the most important plank, which allows police to stop and question the immigration status of those they suspect are in the country illegally.

David Axelrod

We bantered about my hometown of Chicago, where he had taught law before ascending to the bench. He opined on wine and music and generally lived up to his reputation as a man who told and enjoyed a good story.

And then our conversation took an unexpected turn.

Justice David Souter, Scalia's longtime colleague on the court, had just announced his retirement, creating a vacancy for President Obama to fill. Scalia figured that as senior adviser to the new president, I might have some influence on the decision -- or at least enough to pass along a message.

WASHINGTON – It began Thursday as an emotionally charged Senate hearing with Christine Blasey Ford offering gripping testimony that rallied congressional Democrats to her side. It ended with a fiery, passionate defense from Brett Kavanaugh that cemented Republican support for their embattled Supreme Court nominee.

After more than seven hours of questions and answers, heated rhetoric and tearful recollections, not one senator said publicly they had changed their mind about Kavanaugh's bid to sit on the nation's highest court.

And most lawmakers on the fence – specifically just a handful of moderates in each party – stayed there, at least for now.

Only one, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., announced his decision. Both Ford and Kavanaugh were ""compelling,"" but the nominee ""deserves the presumption of innocence"" and he's qualified for the lifetime appointment, Corker said.

Other wavering senators, including Republicans Susan Collins of Maine and Jeff Flake of Arizona, hold Kavanaugh’s fate in their hands. They stayed mostly mum on Thursday, with several going out of their way to avoid reporters stationed across the Capitol.

Flake, a member of the committee, gave no hint of his leanings and asked no questions at the hearing. Instead, he described the committee as a group of 21 ""imperfect"" individuals, and said that the two witnesses' conflicting accounts left considerable doubt.

""We’ll never move beyond that,"" the Arizona senator declared.

Others lawmakers in Washington absorbed the bruising hearing and then retreated to their partisan camps. Senate Democrats escalated their demands for an FBI investigation and a delay in the nomination process. Republicans stuck to their collective message that the vote should be held as quickly as possible.

supreme_court,National Review,2,http://www.nationalreview.com/article/446515/supreme-court-nomination-filibuster-gone,"Karma, Precedent, and the Nuclear Option",2017-04-06,"Charles Krauthammer, John Mccormack, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Mairead Mcardle, Robert Verbruggen, Carrie Severino, Tobias Hoonhout, Rich Lowry, John Fund","The Democrats reap what they sowed with Harry Reid ’ s court-packing .
For euphemism , dissimulation , and outright hypocrisy , there is nothing quite as entertaining as the periodic Senate dust-ups over Supreme Court appointments and the filibuster . The arguments for and against the filibuster are so well known to both parties as to be practically memorized . Both nonetheless argue their case with great shows of passion and conviction . Then shamelessly switch sides — and scripts — depending on the ideology of the nominee .
Everyone appeals to high principle , when everyone knows these fights are about raw power . When Democrat Harry Reid had the majority in the Senate and Barack Obama in the White House , he abolished the filibuster in 2013 for sub–Supreme Court judicial appointments in order to pack three liberal judges onto the D.C . Circuit Court of Appeals .
Bad karma , bad precedent , he was warned . Republicans would one day be in charge . That day is here and Republicans have just stopped a Democratic filibuster of Neil Gorsuch by extending the Reid Rule to the Supreme Court .
To be sure , there are reasoned arguments to be offered on both sides of the filibuster question . It is true that the need for a supermajority does encourage compromise and coalition building . But given the contemporary state of hyperpolarization — the liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats of 40 years ago are long gone — the supermajority requirement today merely guarantees inaction , which , in turn , amplifies the current popular disgust with politics in general and Congress in particular . In my view , that makes paring back the vastly overused filibuster , on balance , a good thing .
Moreover , killing the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations ( the so-called nuclear option ) yields two gratifications : It allows a superb young conservative jurist to ascend to the seat once held by Antonin Scalia . And it constitutes condign punishment for the reckless arrogance of Reid and his erstwhile Democratic majority .
A major reason these fights over Supreme Court nominations have become so bitter and unseemly is the stakes — the political stakes . The Supreme Court has become more than ever a superlegislature . From abortion to gay marriage , it has appropriated to itself the final word . It rules — and the normal democratic impulses , expressed through the elected branches , are henceforth stifled .
Why have we had almost half a century of massive street demonstrations over abortion ? Because the ballot box is not available . The court has spoken , and the question is supposedly settled for all time .
This transfer of legislative authority has suited American liberalism rather well . When you command the allegiance of 20 to 25 percent of the population ( as measured by Gallup ) , you know that whatever control you will have of the elected branches will be fleeting ( 2009–10 , for example ) . So how do you turn the political order in your direction ? Capture the courts .
They are what banks were to Willie Sutton . They are where you go for the right political outcomes . Note how practically every argument at the Gorsuch hearings was about political outcomes . Where would he come out on abortion ? Gay marriage ? The Democrats pretended this was about principle , e.g. , the sanctity of precedent . But everyone knows which precedents they selectively cherish : Roe v. Wade and , more recently , Obergefell v. Hodges .

The Democrats reap what they sowed with Harry Reid’s court-packing.

For euphemism, dissimulation, and outright hypocrisy, there is nothing quite as entertaining as the periodic Senate dust-ups over Supreme Court appointments and the filibuster. The arguments for and against the filibuster are so well known to both parties as to be practically memorized. Both nonetheless argue their case with great shows of passion and conviction. Then shamelessly switch sides — and scripts — depending on the ideology of the nominee.

Everyone appeals to high principle, when everyone knows these fights are about raw power. When Democrat Harry Reid had the majority in the Senate and Barack Obama in the White House, he abolished the filibuster in 2013 for sub–Supreme Court judicial appointments in order to pack three liberal judges onto the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.

Bad karma, bad precedent, he was warned. Republicans would one day be in charge. That day is here and Republicans have just stopped a Democratic filibuster of Neil Gorsuch by extending the Reid Rule to the Supreme Court.

To be sure, there are reasoned arguments to be offered on both sides of the filibuster question. It is true that the need for a supermajority does encourage compromise and coalition building. But given the contemporary state of hyperpolarization — the liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats of 40 years ago are long gone — the supermajority requirement today merely guarantees inaction, which, in turn, amplifies the current popular disgust with politics in general and Congress in particular. In my view, that makes paring back the vastly overused filibuster, on balance, a good thing.

Moreover, killing the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations (the so-called nuclear option) yields two gratifications: It allows a superb young conservative jurist to ascend to the seat once held by Antonin Scalia. And it constitutes condign punishment for the reckless arrogance of Reid and his erstwhile Democratic majority.

A major reason these fights over Supreme Court nominations have become so bitter and unseemly is the stakes — the political stakes. The Supreme Court has become more than ever a superlegislature. From abortion to gay marriage, it has appropriated to itself the final word. It rules — and the normal democratic impulses, expressed through the elected branches, are henceforth stifled.

Why have we had almost half a century of massive street demonstrations over abortion? Because the ballot box is not available. The court has spoken, and the question is supposedly settled for all time.

This transfer of legislative authority has suited American liberalism rather well. When you command the allegiance of 20 to 25 percent of the population (as measured by Gallup), you know that whatever control you will have of the elected branches will be fleeting (2009–10, for example). So how do you turn the political order in your direction? Capture the courts.

They are what banks were to Willie Sutton. They are where you go for the right political outcomes. Note how practically every argument at the Gorsuch hearings was about political outcomes. Where would he come out on abortion? Gay marriage? The Democrats pretended this was about principle, e.g., the sanctity of precedent. But everyone knows which precedents they selectively cherish: Roe v. Wade and, more recently, Obergefell v. Hodges.

Liberalism does not want to admit that the Court has become its last reliable instrument for achieving its political objectives. So liberals have created a great philosophical superstructure to justify their freewheeling, freestyle constitutional interpretation. They present themselves as defenders of a “living Constitution,” under which the role of the Court is to reflect the evolving norms of society. With its finger on the pulse of the people, the Court turns contemporary culture into constitutional law.

But this is nonsense. In a democracy, what better embodiment of evolving norms can there be than elected representatives? By what logic are the norms of a vast and variegated people better reflected in nine appointed lawyers produced by exactly three law schools?

If anything, the purpose of a constitutional court such as ours is to enforce old norms that have preserved both our vitality and our liberty for 230 years. How? By providing a rugged, reliable frame within which the political churnings of each generation take place.

The Gorsuch nomination is a bitter setback to the liberal project of using the courts to ratchet leftward the law and society. However, Gorsuch’s appointment simply preserves the Court’s ideological balance of power. Wait for the next nomination. Having gratuitously forfeited the filibuster, Democrats will be facing the loss of the Court for a generation.

The other thing about them is that they do n't want to be on the wrong side of history . It seems pretty clear where this is going , with a much broader recognition of same-sex marriage , and so the justices do n't want to call that into question when the country is headed in that direction .

In fact , the court has set itself up to `` punt '' on both Proposition 8 and DOMA , avoiding for now consideration of the constitutional questions .
Such a `` legal letdown '' could turn on `` standing , '' or the legal authority or eligibility of those involved in the lawsuit to argue the case . California 's governor has refused to defend Proposition 8 in court , leaving a coalition of private groups to step in . Can they satisfy court scrutiny by establishing they would suffer tangible harm if the lower court ruling stands ?
The justices could also `` DIG '' it , that is , have the case `` dismissed as improvidently granted . '' Basically , the justices would be saying they should not have taken the Proposition 8 appeal in the first place .
Justice Sonia Sotomayor at the March oral argument suggested as much : `` If the issue is letting the states experiment and letting the society have more time to figure out its direction , why is taking a case now the answer ? '' Some of her conservative colleagues seemed to agree as well .
The difference between rejecting the case on standing or DIG grounds would be important . A DIG would be likely to mean lower court rulings striking down Proposition 8 would hold , allowing California gay and lesbian couples to marry if they chose . How quickly that would happen is unclear because further legal challenges could be filed .
But a `` standing '' ruling would likely nullify everything , perhaps forcing both sides to start all over again in the lower courts , and limiting the reach of gay marriage to perhaps only a few California counties . Another statewide referendum , likely to be held next year , could finally settle the matter . Recent polls show growing support for same-sex marriage in California , reflecting a trend nationwide .
DOMA has its own sticky procedural questions . Obama now supports gay marriage , and has refused to defend the 1996 federal law . That has left House Republicans as the official parties in support of DOMA .
So the court could also dismiss that case on standing grounds . Most legal analysts , however , expect a more substantive ruling , one based on DOMA 's merits .
Picking winners and losers at this stage is a subjective , even partisan , exercise . The court itself will be both cheered and vilified however it rules . But as an institution , it has survived similar crises of confidence over its discretionary authority in rulings involving slavery , racial integration , corporate power , abortion -- even Bush v.

supreme_court,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/2018/2/26/17053202/daca-supreme-court-ruling-trump,The Supreme Court may have just kept DACA on life support for several more months,2018-02-26,"Dara Lind, Sigal Samuel, Terry Nguyen, Rebecca Jennings, Hannah Brown, Lauren Katz, Theodore Schleifer","The judicial battle over the Trump administration ’ s efforts to wind down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) program , which protected 690,000 young unauthorized immigrants from deportation , has just been extended by several months .
On Monday , the Supreme Court rejected a highly unusual request from the Trump administration : to skip over the second level of the federal court process ( the courts of appeals ) by having the Supreme Court consider an order made in January by a California district court judge .
The January order partially reanimated the DACA program , which the Trump administration began winding down in September 2017 ( with the expectation that work permits issued under the program would start expiring in large numbers on March 5 of this year ) .
Immigrants who have work permits under DACA ( or whose work permits recently expired ) are currently eligible to apply for renewals under the order . The Trump administration is trying to get that order overturned , so that it doesn ’ t have to renew anyone ’ s work permits while the case over the constitutionality of ending DACA works its way through the courts .
By rejecting the administration ’ s request , the Supreme Court isn ’ t saying anything about the merits of the DACA program itself , or about the legal arguments over the Trump administration ’ s decision to end it . It ’ s just insisting that the case proceed the normal way , with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals hearing the administration ’ s appeal of the California judge ’ s order ( and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals on the East Coast hearing an appeal of a similar order issued in February by a New York judge ) .
That process is likely to take months — and it ’ s extremely unlikely that both appeals courts ( both of which are fairly liberal and have consistently ruled against the Trump administration on immigration issues ) are going to side with the administration . That means that renewals will likely remain open at least until the Supreme Court agrees to take up the cases after the appeals courts rule — which will almost certainly be during the Court ’ s next term , which starts in October of this year .
In theory , by that point , Congress may have passed a bill to provide a longer-term solution for the status of DACA recipients and other unauthorized immigrants who came to the US as children ( including those who meet the criteria for DACA but didn ’ t apply before September 5 , 2017 ; even under the federal court orders , no one can apply for DACA for the first time ) .
On the other hand , it ’ s possible that Congress could point to the now-prolonged court fight as yet another reason it ’ s not urgent for them to act .
The court fight over DACA is keeping the program on life support — but it won ’ t save it for good
On September 5 , the Trump administration announced that it was ending DACA . The administration immediately stopped accepting new applications for two-year deportation protections and work permits . DACA recipients whose work permits were set to expire before March 5 , 2018 were given a month to apply for one last two-year renewal . And immigrants whose work permits were set to expire after March 5 were given no chance to renew at all — the expiration date on the work permit they held would mark the last day they were able to work legally , and live without fear , in the United States .
( Because not everyone who was eligible for renewals applied in time , an average of 122 immigrants are losing DACA protections each day right now ; on March 5 , that number is estimated to climb to over 400 a day , and around August 2018 , it would climb to over 1,000 a day . )
Several different lawsuits got filed over the end of DACA , arguing that the Trump administration had acted illegally in winding down the program . In one of those — filed by the University of California — federal judge William Alsup ruled in January that there was evidence to suggest that the administration had in fact violated the law , by not going through a standard deliberative process or doing enough to consider the costs of ending DACA . Therefore , he said , he was going to put the rollback of the program on hold while he considered the legal questions more fully .
Here ’ s the way the process is supposed to go from there : the Trump administration would appeal the judge ’ s ruling to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals , then , if the 9th Circuit sided with the judge and against the administration ( as is likely , given the 9th Circuit ’ s track record ) , take that appeal to the Supreme Court . Here ’ s the way the process actually went : the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to let them skip the 9th Circuit .
The Department of Justice ’ s ostensible reason was that the question of ending DACA was so important that it couldn ’ t be dragged out ( though , weirdly , the Trump administration didn ’ t ask the Supreme Court to immediately put a hold on Judge Alsup ’ s ruling ) .
It ’ s also possible that the administration ’ s disdain for the “ liberal 9th Circuit , ” rooted in the meme that the Supreme Court routinely smacks down liberal decisions made by the West Coast court , led it to figure that the Supreme Court might be okay with bending the rules if it meant cutting the 9th Circuit out .
In the meantime , a New York judge issued a similar ruling to Judge Alsup ’ s — meaning that even if the 9th Circuit were to somehow side with Trump , it wouldn ’ t change anything about what the administration could do . The Department of Justice now has two different rulings it has to overturn to get its way — whether in the 2nd and 9th Circuit Courts , or at the Supreme Court level after one of those circuit courts rules .
But the administration ’ s repeated legal setbacks don ’ t mean that DACA is going to last . For one thing , the program is already living in a weird , zombified form . For another thing , the legal arguments against the administration that the judges have relied on haven ’ t been about whether it was legal to end DACA at all — they ’ ve been about whether the administration went about it the right way .
Even in a worst-case scenario for the administration , in which even the Supreme Court ( which has granted the administration much more leeway on immigration policy than the 2nd and 9th Circuits ) rules that the administration acted too hastily in killing DACA , it probably wouldn ’ t prevent the administration from going through a slower , more deliberative process and achieving the same result .
Approximately 122 immigrants each day , since October , have had their DACA-issued work permits expire because they were unable to apply in time for renewals ( after the Trump administration suddenly shortened the application window in September ) . That ’ ll add up to about 22,000 immigrants by the time we get to March 5 .
Approximately 668,000 immigrants have work permits issued under DACA that won ’ t expire until March 5 or later .
Both of these groups of immigrants — as well as immigrants whose DACA expired between September 5 , 2016 , and September 5 , 2017 — can apply for a two-year renewal ( thanks to the court order issued in January ) . An unknown number of them have already applied .
USCIS has started approving renewal applications and sending out two-year work permits to DACA recipients who applied after the renewal window opened in January . But we don ’ t know how many of those applications have been approved , or how long USCIS is taking to process applications . Even when DACA was in full swing , USCIS recommended that applicants give them 90 to 120 days to process a renewal application . So it is likely that some DACA recipients are watching their work permits expire while their renewals wait in the processing queue .
Immigrants whose existing DACA permits have expired haven ’ t been rounded up en masse by ICE . However , some have been turned over to ICE agents and put in deportation proceedings .
An average of 425 immigrants are currently set to lose their work permits each day from March 5 to March 31 , in the absence of USCIS sending out any renewals . That pace will rocket up to over 1,000 a day starting in August . But ...
Any immigrant worried about the loss of her work permit will be able to apply for a two-year renewal , at least until the court order issued in January is struck down . Some of them have already done so .
Because it ’ s not yet clear how long USCIS is taking to process DACA renewals , it ’ s not clear how much risk DACA recipients run of losing their existing work permits while they wait for the new ones to come in . If USCIS is working quickly to send out renewed work permits before March 5 , it will probably reduce the number of people losing their work permits each day by some amount ; it ’ s more likely , given processing time , that the pace of people losing DACA will stay at its projected pace through April , and would then slow as USCIS starts sending new work permits to renewal applicants .
The lion ’ s share of DACA recipients will still be safe for several more months . As many as 622,000 immigrants have work permits issued under DACA that won ’ t expire until August 1 or later . At this pace , it would take until February 2019 for more than half of DACA recipients to lose their protections — and that pace doesn ’ t reflect any of the renewals that could be issued under the court order .
The Trump administration has said clearly that ICE won ’ t actively target people whose DACA work permits have expired en masse . But it ’ s said just as clearly that if ICE agents happen to come across immigrants who have lost DACA protections , they ’ re just as vulnerable to arrest or deportation as anyone else .
Hundreds of thousands of immigrants have been in a state of uncertainty and anxiety since September 2017 — and even earlier , as DACA recipients wondered what President Trump would do to them . Congress still has the power to alleviate that uncertainty . But if it couldn ’ t do so without the impetus of a deadline , it may feel even less urgency without one .","The judicial battle over the Trump administration’s efforts to wind down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which protected 690,000 young unauthorized immigrants from deportation, has just been extended by several months.

On Monday, the Supreme Court rejected a highly unusual request from the Trump administration: to skip over the second level of the federal court process (the courts of appeals) by having the Supreme Court consider an order made in January by a California district court judge.

The January order partially reanimated the DACA program, which the Trump administration began winding down in September 2017 (with the expectation that work permits issued under the program would start expiring in large numbers on March 5 of this year).

Immigrants who have work permits under DACA (or whose work permits recently expired) are currently eligible to apply for renewals under the order. The Trump administration is trying to get that order overturned, so that it doesn’t have to renew anyone’s work permits while the case over the constitutionality of ending DACA works its way through the courts.

By rejecting the administration’s request, the Supreme Court isn’t saying anything about the merits of the DACA program itself, or about the legal arguments over the Trump administration’s decision to end it. It’s just insisting that the case proceed the normal way, with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals hearing the administration’s appeal of the California judge’s order (and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals on the East Coast hearing an appeal of a similar order issued in February by a New York judge).

That process is likely to take months — and it’s extremely unlikely that both appeals courts (both of which are fairly liberal and have consistently ruled against the Trump administration on immigration issues) are going to side with the administration. That means that renewals will likely remain open at least until the Supreme Court agrees to take up the cases after the appeals courts rule — which will almost certainly be during the Court’s next term, which starts in October of this year.

In theory, by that point, Congress may have passed a bill to provide a longer-term solution for the status of DACA recipients and other unauthorized immigrants who came to the US as children (including those who meet the criteria for DACA but didn’t apply before September 5, 2017; even under the federal court orders, no one can apply for DACA for the first time).

On the other hand, it’s possible that Congress could point to the now-prolonged court fight as yet another reason it’s not urgent for them to act.

The court fight over DACA is keeping the program on life support — but it won’t save it for good

On September 5, the Trump administration announced that it was ending DACA. The administration immediately stopped accepting new applications for two-year deportation protections and work permits. DACA recipients whose work permits were set to expire before March 5, 2018 were given a month to apply for one last two-year renewal. And immigrants whose work permits were set to expire after March 5 were given no chance to renew at all — the expiration date on the work permit they held would mark the last day they were able to work legally, and live without fear, in the United States.

(Because not everyone who was eligible for renewals applied in time, an average of 122 immigrants are losing DACA protections each day right now; on March 5, that number is estimated to climb to over 400 a day, and around August 2018, it would climb to over 1,000 a day.)

Several different lawsuits got filed over the end of DACA, arguing that the Trump administration had acted illegally in winding down the program. In one of those — filed by the University of California — federal judge William Alsup ruled in January that there was evidence to suggest that the administration had in fact violated the law, by not going through a standard deliberative process or doing enough to consider the costs of ending DACA. Therefore, he said, he was going to put the rollback of the program on hold while he considered the legal questions more fully.

Here’s the way the process is supposed to go from there: the Trump administration would appeal the judge’s ruling to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, then, if the 9th Circuit sided with the judge and against the administration (as is likely, given the 9th Circuit’s track record), take that appeal to the Supreme Court. Here’s the way the process actually went: the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to let them skip the 9th Circuit.

The Department of Justice’s ostensible reason was that the question of ending DACA was so important that it couldn’t be dragged out (though, weirdly, the Trump administration didn’t ask the Supreme Court to immediately put a hold on Judge Alsup’s ruling).

It’s also possible that the administration’s disdain for the “liberal 9th Circuit,” rooted in the meme that the Supreme Court routinely smacks down liberal decisions made by the West Coast court, led it to figure that the Supreme Court might be okay with bending the rules if it meant cutting the 9th Circuit out.

In the meantime, a New York judge issued a similar ruling to Judge Alsup’s — meaning that even if the 9th Circuit were to somehow side with Trump, it wouldn’t change anything about what the administration could do. The Department of Justice now has two different rulings it has to overturn to get its way — whether in the 2nd and 9th Circuit Courts, or at the Supreme Court level after one of those circuit courts rules.

But the administration’s repeated legal setbacks don’t mean that DACA is going to last. For one thing, the program is already living in a weird, zombified form. For another thing, the legal arguments against the administration that the judges have relied on haven’t been about whether it was legal to end DACA at all — they’ve been about whether the administration went about it the right way.

Even in a worst-case scenario for the administration, in which even the Supreme Court (which has granted the administration much more leeway on immigration policy than the 2nd and 9th Circuits) rules that the administration acted too hastily in killing DACA, it probably wouldn’t prevent the administration from going through a slower, more deliberative process and achieving the same result.

What this means for DACA recipients

Here’s how DACA is working right now:

Approximately 122 immigrants each day, since October, have had their DACA-issued work permits expire because they were unable to apply in time for renewals (after the Trump administration suddenly shortened the application window in September). That’ll add up to about 22,000 immigrants by the time we get to March 5.

Approximately 668,000 immigrants have work permits issued under DACA that won’t expire until March 5 or later.

Both of these groups of immigrants — as well as immigrants whose DACA expired between September 5, 2016, and September 5, 2017 — can apply for a two-year renewal (thanks to the court order issued in January). An unknown number of them have already applied.

USCIS has started approving renewal applications and sending out two-year work permits to DACA recipients who applied after the renewal window opened in January. But we don’t know how many of those applications have been approved, or how long USCIS is taking to process applications. Even when DACA was in full swing, USCIS recommended that applicants give them 90 to 120 days to process a renewal application. So it is likely that some DACA recipients are watching their work permits expire while their renewals wait in the processing queue.

Immigrants whose existing DACA permits have expired haven’t been rounded up en masse by ICE. However, some have been turned over to ICE agents and put in deportation proceedings.

Here’s what will happen after March 5:

An average of 425 immigrants are currently set to lose their work permits each day from March 5 to March 31, in the absence of USCIS sending out any renewals. That pace will rocket up to over 1,000 a day starting in August. But ...

Any immigrant worried about the loss of her work permit will be able to apply for a two-year renewal, at least until the court order issued in January is struck down. Some of them have already done so.

Because it’s not yet clear how long USCIS is taking to process DACA renewals, it’s not clear how much risk DACA recipients run of losing their existing work permits while they wait for the new ones to come in. If USCIS is working quickly to send out renewed work permits before March 5, it will probably reduce the number of people losing their work permits each day by some amount; it’s more likely, given processing time, that the pace of people losing DACA will stay at its projected pace through April, and would then slow as USCIS starts sending new work permits to renewal applicants.

The lion’s share of DACA recipients will still be safe for several more months. As many as 622,000 immigrants have work permits issued under DACA that won’t expire until August 1 or later. At this pace, it would take until February 2019 for more than half of DACA recipients to lose their protections — and that pace doesn’t reflect any of the renewals that could be issued under the court order.

The Trump administration has said clearly that ICE won’t actively target people whose DACA work permits have expired en masse. But it’s said just as clearly that if ICE agents happen to come across immigrants who have lost DACA protections, they’re just as vulnerable to arrest or deportation as anyone else.

Hundreds of thousands of immigrants have been in a state of uncertainty and anxiety since September 2017 — and even earlier, as DACA recipients wondered what President Trump would do to them. Congress still has the power to alleviate that uncertainty. But if it couldn’t do so without the impetus of a deadline, it may feel even less urgency without one.",www.vox.com,left,ynZe3swiAj7UtKZc

But William Burck, a lawyer representing Bush in the document production, said in a letter released by the committee that after conferring with the White House and the Justice Department, some records would be withheld on the grounds of executive privilege.

‘Candid Advice’

According to the letter, the bulk of the documents withheld cover “deliberations and candid advice” about potential nominees for federal courts, while the remainder include substantive communications between Bush and his staff regarding executive orders and legislation. Kavanaugh “dealt with some of the most sensitive communications of any White House official,” the letter said.

An assertion of executive privilege, used to block release of information to Congress, the courts or the public on grounds of national security or to protect private White House deliberations, can only be made by a sitting president. Trump’s White House is asserting the privilege to protect communications of the Bush White House.

‘Not Normal’

Kennedy’s Seat

Kavanaugh’s nomination to fill the seat held by Justice Anthony Kennedy, who stepped down at the end of the Supreme Court’s term in June, has worried some senators concerned about his views on decisions such as Roe v. Wade in 1973, which established a woman’s right to obtain an abortion.

Tuesday's ruling is a victory for school choice proponents and some conservative religious groups who had challenged the provision in court. Montana's program was similar to many across the U.S., and other states have proposed tax-credit scholarship programs but not passed them due to confusion about their legality.

Roberts once again served as the swing vote in a 5-4 decision. This time, he joined his fellow justices in the conservative wing of the court. On Monday, Republicans railed against him for siding with the liberal contingent in a 5-4 case that struck down a Louisiana law that place restrictions on abortions by requiring that those who perform the procedures have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.

The high court will hear arguments for the case in late April , with a decision by late June .
Justices were slated to hear the case on Feb. 19 , but last month , justices suspended oral arguments on the plan to add a citizenship question to the census next year . The justices put the matter on hold after a federal district court judge ruled the government could not proceed with its plans .
FEDERAL JUDGE BARS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION FROM ADDING CITIZENSHIP QUESTION TO 2020 CENSUS
The Trump administration , though , announced last month that it would directly ask the Supreme Court to overrule the federal court judge , who said in a court opinion that such a question would dramatically reduce the response rate—and congressional representation—of non-citizens .
The judge , though , ruled that while a question on citizenship would be constitutional , U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had added it arbitrarily and did not follow proper procedure . Among other things , the judge said that Ross didn ’ t follow a law requiring that he give Congress three years notice of any plan to add a question about citizenship to the census . That ruling came in a case in which a dozen states or big cities and immigrants ’ rights groups argued that the Commerce Department , which designs the census , had failed to properly analyze the effect the question would have on immigrant households .
The Commerce Department , last May , said in a statement that the citizenship question would be added to the 2020 census count in response to a request made by the Justice Department in December 2017 . The statement said that Ross had “ determined that reinstatement of a citizenship question on the 2020 decennial census questionnaire is necessary to provide complete and accurate census block level data . ”
The census count is required by the Constitution , and its results are used to determine federal spending , as well as the number of congressional seats allocated to each state for the next decade , as well as the number of electoral votes available from each state .
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ESCALATES FIGHT OVER CENSUS CITIZENSHIP QUESTION , TURNING TO SUPREME COURT
Republicans largely supported the additional census question as a logical step . Democrats say the inclusion of such a question amounts to an effort to intimidate immigrant communities and siphon money and electoral power away from them .
But last year , the Commerce Department pointed out that almost every decennial census between 1820 and 1950 “ asked a question about citizenship in some form. ” The department also said the citizenship question would be “ the same as the one that it asked on the yearly American Community Service ( ACS ) , ” which is sent to a much smaller percentage of American homes than the actual census .
“ The citizenship data provided to the [ Department of Justice ] will be more accurate with the question than without it , ” Ross said last May . “ Which is of greater importance than any adverse effect that may result from people violating their legal duty to respond . ”","The Supreme Court will decide whether the 2020 census can include a question about citizenship, ensuring a quick review of a lower court ruling that blocked the Trump administration from doing so.

FEDERAL JUDGE BARS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION FROM ADDING CITIZENSHIP QUESTION TO 2020 CENSUS

The Trump administration, though, announced last month that it would directly ask the Supreme Court to overrule the federal court judge, who said in a court opinion that such a question would dramatically reduce the response rate—and congressional representation—of non-citizens.

The judge, though, ruled that while a question on citizenship would be constitutional, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had added it arbitrarily and did not follow proper procedure. Among other things, the judge said that Ross didn’t follow a law requiring that he give Congress three years notice of any plan to add a question about citizenship to the census. That ruling came in a case in which a dozen states or big cities and immigrants’ rights groups argued that the Commerce Department, which designs the census, had failed to properly analyze the effect the question would have on immigrant households.

The Commerce Department, last May, said in a statement that the citizenship question would be added to the 2020 census count in response to a request made by the Justice Department in December 2017. The statement said that Ross had “determined that reinstatement of a citizenship question on the 2020 decennial census questionnaire is necessary to provide complete and accurate census block level data.”

The census count is required by the Constitution, and its results are used to determine federal spending, as well as the number of congressional seats allocated to each state for the next decade, as well as the number of electoral votes available from each state.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ESCALATES FIGHT OVER CENSUS CITIZENSHIP QUESTION, TURNING TO SUPREME COURT

Republicans largely supported the additional census question as a logical step. Democrats say the inclusion of such a question amounts to an effort to intimidate immigrant communities and siphon money and electoral power away from them.

But last year, the Commerce Department pointed out that almost every decennial census between 1820 and 1950 “asked a question about citizenship in some form.” The department also said the citizenship question would be “the same as the one that it asked on the yearly American Community Service (ACS),” which is sent to a much smaller percentage of American homes than the actual census.

“The citizenship data provided to the [Department of Justice] will be more accurate with the question than without it,” Ross said last May. “Which is of greater importance than any adverse effect that may result from people violating their legal duty to respond.”

The end is near. Maybe.

Friday and Saturday could bring Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to a conclusion with the Senate taking up a full vote over his confirmation to the Supreme Court.

But how will that work and how do we expect the vote to go once it begins? These are among the questions being asked on social media by people on the edge of their digital seats watching the process unfold.

So here is a quick breakdown of what we know and what is expected to happen this weekend.

When will the Senate begin the voting process?

It's called a ""cloture"" vote and it puts the Senate on the clock. This procedural vote on the Kavanaugh nomination is scheduled for Friday at 10:30 a.m. EDT. If it passes, it could pave the way for a final vote as early as Saturday.

It's an important vote because it also effectively blocks any filibuster attempt by Democrats to delay a vote on Kavanaugh and officially gives the Senate 30 hours to debate the nomination.

The 30 hours gets divided equally between Republicans and Democrats. The debate could take less than the 30-hour maximum if either party decides not to use all of its allotted time.

What happens when the time is up?

After those 30 hours, the Senate would take a final vote on whether to confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. A vote could happen as early as Saturday. However, there is one hitch: Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., who is a reliable vote for Kavanaugh, will be walking his daughter down the aisle at her wedding on Saturday and will not be available to vote. That could lead Republican leaders to delay the vote until Sunday or later next week.

It would take only a simple majority of 51 votes to approve Kavanaugh. Republicans hold 51 seats, while Democrats and two independents aligned with them hold the remaining 49.

How have senators indicated they will vote?

Three Republican senators are still undecided as of Thursday afternoon: Jeff Flake of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.

If only one of those senators votes against Kavanaugh, and the other two vote in favor of him, that would bring the vote total to 50-50. In that case, Vice President Mike Pence would become the tiebreaker.

But more uncertainty remains because there is one undecided Democrat: Joe Manchin of West Virginia. He hails from a state President Donald Trump won in 2016, and faces a tough re-election bid this fall.

If two of the undecided Republican senators were to vote against Kavanaugh, but Manchin voted for him, that would also result in a tie and give the vote to Pence.

However, as noted above, Montana Republican Sen. Steve Daines will be attending his daughter's wedding on Saturday, which makes getting enough votes harder for Republicans. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., could decide to delay the vote past Saturday if he believes he needs Daines' vote.

The Supreme Court struck an extraordinary blow for criminal justice reform on Wednesday, placing real limitations on policing for profit across the country. Its unanimous decision for the first time prohibits all 50 states from imposing excessive fines, including the seizure of property, on people accused or convicted of a crime. Rarely does the court hand down a ruling of such constitutional magnitude—and seldom do all nine justices agree to restrict the power that police and prosecutors exert over individuals. The landmark decision represents a broad agreement on the Supreme Court that law enforcement’s legalized theft has gone too far.

Wednesday’s ruling in Timbs v. Indiana, authored by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, is sharp and concise. It revolves around a single question of extraordinary importance. The Eighth Amendment guarantees that no “excessive fines” may be “imposed,” an ancient right enshrined in the Magna Carta and enthusiastically adopted by the Framers. But the Bill of Rights originally applied only to the federal government, not the states. After the Civil War, the 14th Amendment was ratified to apply these rights to the states, which had engaged in grotesque civil rights violations to perpetuate slavery. The Supreme Court, however, slowly applied (or “incorporated”) these rights against the states one by one, not all at once. And before Timbs, it had never incorporated the Excessive Fines Clause—allowing states to exploit their residents for huge sums of cash and property.

They did so through civil asset forfeiture, a process that we would call theft in any other context. Here’s how it works: Prosecutors accuse an individual of a crime, then seize assets that have some tenuous connection to the alleged offense. The individual need not be convicted or even charged with an actual crime, and her assets are seized through a civil proceeding, which lacks the due process safeguards of a criminal trial. Law enforcement can seize money or property, including one’s home, business, or vehicle. It gets to keep the profits, creating a perverse incentive that encourages police abuses. Because the standards are so loose, people with little to no involvement in criminal activity often get caught up in civil asset forfeiture. For instance, South Carolina police tried to seize an elderly woman’s home because drug deals occurred on the property—even though she had no connection to the crimes and tried to stop them.

Her current boss and his party may struggle to do that in the midterms .
A number of polls have shown Trump ’ s approval dipping more sharply with women than with men , and party insiders had already been worried about facing a reckoning with moderate , suburban women on Election Day .
A CNN poll released last week indicated that the president ’ s job performance won the approval of 42 percent of men but only 29 percent of women . A Quinnipiac University poll , also released last week , showed women favoring Democrats in the midterms by a 20-point margin ( 55-35 percent ) while men did so only by a 6-point margin ( 48-42 percent ) .
All of that was before Ford gave up her anonymity at the weekend to allege that Kavanaugh had held her down , groped her and tried to undress her at a party in the Maryland suburbs of Washington in the 1980s , when both were high school students . Ford ’ s attorney , Deborah Katz , has said that her client considers Kavanaugh ’ s actions to be tantamount to attempted rape .
Kavanaugh has emphatically denied the allegations , and no witness has corroborated them . The White House has stood with him .
In a statement released through the White House on Monday morning , the judge said that the allegations were “ completely false , ” that he has “ never done anything like what the accuser describes—to her or to anyone , ” and that he was so perplexed by the allegation , which first emerged anonymously , that he did not know who the accuser was until she identified herself .
Still , even Republicans who were relieved by Trump ’ s modulated initial response worry about the controversy ’ s capacity to hurt the party politically .
“ There are so many moving parts that may make it easier for this to be handled poorly , ” said Doug Heye , a former communications director for the Republican National Committee .
“ Even if the [ Senate Judiciary ] committee does a good job , if the president is not on message and tweeting things that only serve to further excite a Democratic base , that could be a real problem . ”
Democrats , opposed to Kavanaugh ’ s nomination because of his overarching conservative philosophy , are hoping that new allegations may be enough to persuade some Republicans to thwart the effort to confirm him .
“ I think there are so many reasons to be against Kavanaugh , but if the Republicans ’ fear about the election is the thing that ultimately drives enough of them to pull back , we ’ ll take it , ” said Democratic strategist Hilary Rosen .
“ Look , I think if Republicans confirm a sexual harasser to the bench , it will inflame women — and many men — across the country , significantly , in the election . But I hope it doesn ’ t come to that , ” Rosen added .
The bulk of the Senate — in which the GOP holds a 51-49 majority — is expected to vote along party lines on Kavanaugh .
Attention is therefore focused on Republicans who could potentially oppose him — Sens .

Collins told reporters on Monday that , if Kavanaugh were found to by lying about the incident described by Ford , that would be “ disqualifying . ”
In a statement , Murkowski noted that both Ford and Kavanaugh should get the opportunity to testify .
Manchin and Heitkamp share that view , and Donnelly had said that the Judiciary Committee vote scheduled for Thursday should be postponed — a request that has now been met .
But the controversy will also percolate through other key races .

Vanderbilt University professor Bruce Oppenheimer pointed to a seeming paradox in the Volunteer State : Whoever lost the battle over Kavanaugh ’ s nomination was more likely to get an electoral boost , he suggested .
“ If Republicans go right ahead and confirm him , I think there will be a cost for that to Republicans running for the Senate , because it will activate women who will feel the charges have not been taken seriously enough , ” he said .
But he added that if Kavanaugh were derailed , that might also allow Republicans to paint his Democratic critics as overly dogmatic or partisan .

In a statement released through the White House on Monday morning, the judge said that the allegations were “completely false,” that he has “never done anything like what the accuser describes—to her or to anyone,” and that he was so perplexed by the allegation, which first emerged anonymously, that he did not know who the accuser was until she identified herself.

Still, even Republicans who were relieved by Trump’s modulated initial response worry about the controversy’s capacity to hurt the party politically.

“There are so many moving parts that may make it easier for this to be handled poorly,” said Doug Heye, a former communications director for the Republican National Committee.

“Even if the [Senate Judiciary] committee does a good job, if the president is not on message and tweeting things that only serve to further excite a Democratic base, that could be a real problem.”

Democrats, opposed to Kavanaugh’s nomination because of his overarching conservative philosophy, are hoping that new allegations may be enough to persuade some Republicans to thwart the effort to confirm him.

“I think there are so many reasons to be against Kavanaugh, but if the Republicans’ fear about the election is the thing that ultimately drives enough of them to pull back, we’ll take it,” said Democratic strategist Hilary Rosen.

“Look, I think if Republicans confirm a sexual harasser to the bench, it will inflame women — and many men — across the country, significantly, in the election. But I hope it doesn’t come to that,” Rosen added.

The bulk of the Senate — in which the GOP holds a 51-49 majority — is expected to vote along party lines on Kavanaugh.

Attention is therefore focused on Republicans who could potentially oppose him — Sens. Susan Collins Susan Margaret CollinsLawmakers under pressure to pass benefits fix for military families Senate GOP waves Trump off early motion to dismiss impeachment charges GOP senators warn against Trump firing intelligence community official MORE (Maine) and Lisa Murkowksi (Alaska) in particular — as well as three Democratic senators who are fighting for reelection this fall in states Trump won by wide margins in 2016: Sens.

Collins told reporters on Monday that, if Kavanaugh were found to by lying about the incident described by Ford, that would be “disqualifying.”

In a statement, Murkowski noted that both Ford and Kavanaugh should get the opportunity to testify.

Manchin and Heitkamp share that view, and Donnelly had said that the Judiciary Committee vote scheduled for Thursday should be postponed — a request that has now been met.

But the controversy will also percolate through other key races.

In Arizona, for example, two female candidates — Rep. Kyrsten Sinema (D) and Rep.

Vanderbilt University professor Bruce Oppenheimer pointed to a seeming paradox in the Volunteer State: Whoever lost the battle over Kavanaugh’s nomination was more likely to get an electoral boost, he suggested.

“If Republicans go right ahead and confirm him, I think there will be a cost for that to Republicans running for the Senate, because it will activate women who will feel the charges have not been taken seriously enough,” he said.

But he added that if Kavanaugh were derailed, that might also allow Republicans to paint his Democratic critics as overly dogmatic or partisan.

For now, however, everything is in a state of flux.

The political world is bracing for Monday’s hearing — and the fierce fight that will inevitably follow.

US Supreme Court judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg has fractured three ribs in a fall on Wednesday, the court says.

The fall happened in her office at the Supreme Court in Washington.

Ms Ginsburg, 85, went home but was in discomfort and went to George Washington University hospital on Thursday morning, a statement said.

Tests showed that she had fractured three ribs on her left side and she has been admitted for observation and treatment.

The appointment, confirmed last month by the Senate, restores the nine-member court's conservative majority. The court has the final say on issues such as abortion, gun control and voting rules.

President Donald Trump, who nominated Mr Kavanaugh and described the claims against him as a ""hoax"", attended his investiture.

On Twitter, many were quick to offer the liberal justice assistance in the form of extra ribs and human shields to ensure she made it through the Trump presidency.

Prospect of head-spinning change

By Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America Reporter

Many on the left have quipped that Ms Ginsburg, the liberal lioness of the Supreme Court, should be encased in bubble-wrap to ensure she remains safe and healthy until the end of Donald Trump's term. The next time they say that, they may not be joking.

The justice's recent fall has once again sparked concerns for her health and worries about the prospect that the Supreme Court could tilt even further to the right.

When Mr Trump replaced the ultra-conservative Antonin Scalia with Neil Gorsuch, there was no ideological change. But swapping right-leaning moderate Anthony Kennedy with Brett Kavanaugh shifted the court to the right in varying degrees based on the issue.

If the president has the opportunity to fill Ms Ginsburg's seat because she resigns or dies, the change would be a nightmare scenario for Democrats.

Just two days after the mid-term elections, the significance of Republicans maintaining control of the Senate - which confirms presidential nominees - has been put in stark relief. For many conservative voters, another opportunity to shape the Supreme Court was a big part of what the mid-term election fight was all about.

Who is the 'Notorious RBG'?

Ms Ginsburg was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1993 by President Bill Clinton. She had previously focused her work on women's rights and started the first law journal dedicated to the topic.

Ms Ginsburg has survived cancer and in 2012 cracked two ribs in a fall at her home.

Some of her legal opinions, coupled with her refusal to step down during the Obama era, have seen her gain popularity in some quarters and earned her the nickname Notorious RBG.

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in as the 114th Supreme Court justice in a private ceremony Saturday just hours after the Senate voted to confirm him, solidifying conservative control of the highest court in the land for years to come and ending a bitter battle over his nomination.

The confirmation delivered a major win to President Donald Trump, who defended his embattled nominee when sexual assault accusations were leveled against him. Kavanaugh has denied the accusations.

Trump, speaking at a rally in Topeka, Kansas, called it a ""truly historic night"" and a ""tremendous victory."" He added: ""What he and his wonderful family endured at the hands of Democrats is unthinkable.""

Kavanaugh's confirmation was not just a chance for Republicans to shift the court to the right for what could be decades. It was also a test of how public officials responded to the raw emotions unleashed by the #MeToo movement amid accusations from Christine Blasey Ford that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when they were teens. He said the incident never happened.

That controversy will likely be scrutinized even further with the Nov. 6 midterm elections a month away, giving Democrats have a chance to take control of one or more chambers of Congress.

The anger among Kavanaugh's critics was evident on the steps of the Capitol where hundreds of protesters, many dressed in black garb, had gathered on the steps holding signs and chanting. A cordon of police officers stood in front of the doors.

Capitol Police said they arrested 164 people from among the hundreds of protestors who had gathered. Most, some 150, were arrested on the Capitol's east side.

The final Senate vote was 50-48. Sen. Joe Manchin was the only Democrat to break ranks and vote in favor of him.

Trump congratulated Kavanaugh on Twitter and called him a ""great nominee."" He signed Kavanaugh's commission to the Supreme Court aboard Air Force One so he could get to work immediately on the court.

Shortly after, Kavanaugh, accompanied by his family, was sworn in by Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. and retired Justice Anthony Kennedy, who Kavanaugh is replacing, during a private ceremony at the Supreme Court. The 6 p.m. ceremony marks the beginning of his lifetime appointment.

He will hear his first cases next week.

Twists and turns

For weeks, Kavanaugh's future had hung in the balance during hours of hearings, FBI investigations into the sexual assault allegations. The remarkable and ugly set of twists and turns that ended with Saturday's vote.

Kavanaugh's path to confirmation became clear Friday afternoon when Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who had been on the fence for months, announced her support in a 45-minute speech on the Senate floor.

""It is when passions are most inflamed that fairness is most in jeopardy,"" she said. ""I will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh.""

The gesture did not affect the outcome of the final vote but changed the tally to 50-48 in favor of Kavanaugh's confirmation.

Kavanaugh's confirmation was marked by mudslinging from both sides that divided the nation even deeper, but there was one thing both Democrats and Republicans agreed one: It was an ugly process that shouldn't be repeated.

Protesters held signs reading ""Kava Nope"" and ""Shame, Collins,"" the latter a reference to the announcement by Collins that she planned to vote in support of the controversial Kavanaugh. Many of the protesters said they felt powerless but vowed that next month's midterms would change that.

Before Vice President Mike Pence called for the first vote, protesters in the Senate angrily began yelling and were dragged out of the chamber by police.

“I do not consent,” a woman could be heard screaming more than a minute after she was taken away.

“I’m a mother,” one woman shouted.

“I’m a patriot,” another said.

Pence, who is also president of the Senate, had to ask the sergeant at arms to restore order in the gallery at least a half dozen times.

Themes for the midterms

Both Republicans and Democrats expect the Kavanaugh decision to be a central theme in the midterm elections.

Trump's promise during his 2016 campaign to put conservatives on the Supreme Court reinforced his support among Republicans.

In 2018, Democrats hope to ride to a ""blue wave"" of anger over Trump and Kavanaugh that could flip control of Congress. But Republicans believe the battle over Kavanaugh will help energize their voters, too.

Democrats are seen as having a solid chance to captured the House, fueled in part by women voters who are upset over Kavanaugh and dislike Trump. But taking over the Senate is likely to be a lot tougher. Democrats are defending multiple seats in states Trump easily carried in that chamber. In those states, the Kavanaugh vote could help Republicans.

Dianne Feinstein Dianne Emiel FeinsteinSenate Democrats introduce Violence Against Women Act after bipartisan talks break down Harris shares video addressing staffers the night Trump was elected: 'This is some s---' Centrist Democrats seize on state election wins to rail against Warren's agenda MORE (D- Calif.) and the handpicked lawyers who did not have either the process or Dr. Ford’s best interests at heart and encourage as well greater examination of the facts provided by Dr. Ford.

For example, the FBI ought to be able to get more definitive answers about how many people were present at the party, whose house this was (surely the home must have been one of the party goers? Presumably it was not their habit to go into homes with no adults present to gather and have a party in an unoccupied home?) and how she left the party.

The FBI ought to be able to get access to the therapist's full notes, not least because we already know there are significant discrepancies between the details contained in those (late teens, mid 80’s, 4 boys), Dr. Ford’s testimony (15, '82, 2 boys) and the deliberately ambiguous polygraph statement regarding the date.

We do know Democrats are already doing a little pre-suasion, trying to discredit the investigation before it concludes and shift the narrative from sexual abuse to alcohol abuse and perjury — indicators that they don’t think the witnesses will contradict their prior testimony. But because they don’t want a strict constitutionalist on the court, they will persist in any and every attack — and that has another consequence.

Democrats underestimate how completely terrifying this spectacle appears to ordinary people. Here is a man who volunteers in a homeless shelter and coaches girl's basketball and has more female clerks than any other federal judge; and he is being destroyed on accusation alone. How could an ordinary person, without powerful friends, survive such an onslaught?

The same public watched #MeToo start with pretty clear cases against guys who were creeps. Now, some of the cases are much muddier. This new Kavanaugh standard the left wants to impose would mean any one could be named, his reputation and future destroyed and subjected to intense ridicule when he defends himself.

It means what you did in high school, like drinking too much or yearbook references can be a reputation and career destroyer. This terrifies people. Both men and women who have men in their lives.

This controversy could end up working in Republicans favor. The recent drama with Kavanaugh will motivate many to come out — not just the conservative base, but fair-minded Independents who recognize that Democrats have waged an ugly, opportunistic political war to personally destroy a man with a stellar reputation as a public servant and politicized and harmed the reputation of the approval process and the Supreme Court itself, all in hopes of gaining power.

This is not how they think the Senate should behave, it is not the America they want, nor the sort of public drama they want to have to explain to their children.

The Left hopes that they have further sullied Republicans in this episode, but they have shown to many that the Republicans is the party of fairness and themselves extremists.

Democrats just killed the blue wave.

Donald Trump is set to make one of the most consequential decisions of his presidency on Monday when he names a new justice to sit on the US supreme court .
The president ’ s announcement , which with his usual taste for suspense is to be televised live at 9pm from the east room of the White House , could set the direction of the court for decades and light the fuse of an acrimonious political battle .

The nominee ’ s record will come under particular scrutiny for clues as to how he or she might vote in any future review of Roe v Wade , the landmark 1973 decision that guaranteed women ’ s right to abortion .
Trump ’ s pick comes less than two weeks after Justice Anthony Kennedy , often the “ swing vote ” in the court ’ s rulings , announced his retirement , and 18 months after the president won plaudits from conservatives for appointing Neil Gorsuch to the court . This followed a fiercely criticised but ultimately successful strategy by Senate Republicans to block Barack Obama ’ s nominee , Merrick Garland , in 2016 .

Trump has moved quickly to prevent Democrats attempting a similar maneuver before November ’ s midterm elections . Last week the president conducted interviews on Monday and Tuesday , whittling down a list of 25 figures vetted by conservative groups . On Thursday , traveling on Air Force One , he told reporters : “ I think I have it down to four people . And I think of the four people I have it down to three or two . ”
On Friday , in his weekly address , Trump made clear he was looking for a justice who adopts an “ originalist ” interpretation of the constitution . “ Judges are not supposed to rewrite the law , reinvent the constitution , or substitute their own opinions for the will of the people expressed through their laws , ” he said .
And on Monday , the former reality TV celebrity sought to build the drama further by tweeting : “ I have long heard that the most important decision a U.S. President can make is the selection of a Supreme Court Justice - Will be announced tonight at 9:00 P.M . ”
The shortlist reportedly consists of the federal appeals court judges Amy Coney Barrett , Thomas Hardiman , Brett Kavanaugh and Raymond Kethledge . Trump was leaning towards Hardiman and Kavanaugh and has now made a final decision , the New York Times said , citing advisers familiar with the discussions .
Notably , Mike Pence , the vice-president who frequently describes himself as “ a Christian , a conservative and a Republican , in that order ” , is understood to have met the leading contenders and had lunch with Trump on Monday . The White House counsel Donald McGahn , Fox News host Sean Hannity and Trump ’ s sister Judge Maryanne Trump Barry are also believed to have weighed in with their views .
Any one of the shortlisted judges is young enough to potentially sit on the nine-person court for decades and could tip it to the right and revisit landmark rulings on abortion access , racial discrimination , gay rights , voting rights and other issues .
Supreme court pick could put 40 years of affirmative action precedent at risk Read more
Kirsten Gillibrand , a Democratic senator for New York , tweeted : “ You can bet that anyone on @ realDonaldTrump ’ s list of potential SCOTUS nominees would overturn Roe v Wade .

Sarah Weddington , who as a 26-year-old lawyer successfully represented “ Jane Roe ” in the Roe v Wade case , expressed no preference for anyone on Trump ’ s shortlist . “ None of the above , ” she said by phone from Austin , Texas . “ I don ’ t think Trump would be picking someone if they weren ’ t very much opposed to Roe v Wade . I can see lots of reasons why Trump might pick one person or another but none that would be beneficial to Roe v Wade . ”
Trump ’ s relatively recent anti-abortion stance was all about where he thought the votes were rather than principle , she added . “ I think that what it ’ s going to do is create a real backlash by women across the country before the midterm elections . There will be more women who vote in key races in various states . ”
But others suggest that predictions of doom for Roe v Wade are exaggerated . Curt Levey , president of the rightwing advocacy group the Committee for Justice , said : “ I don ’ t see [ chief justice ] John Roberts overturning it . I think conservative justices are also conservative in the small ‘ c ’ sense . They just don ’ t see the courts ’ role as being radical change .
“ Will they slowly eat away at Roe so at future date it might be overturned ? Possibly . But right now I just don ’ t see it . ”
One day after the high-stakes announcement , Trump will head to Europe for a Nato summit , a visit to Britain and a meeting with Vladimir Putin , sure to leave a bitter political brawl in his wake . The White House announced on Monday that the former senator Jon Kyl of Arizona would serve as “ sherpa ” , guiding the nominee through the Senate confirmation process .
But with the Senate on a knife-edge , split 51-49 in favour of Republicans over Democrats , the process is expected to be drawn out and ugly . Activist groups on both sides are waging a multimillion-dollar advertising war urging citizens to pile pressure through phone calls , emails and protests .
Liberals are focused on the Republican senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska , who have previously defended reproductive rights . Collins has said she would not back someone who has demonstrated hostility to Roe v Wade .
Ilyse Hogue , president of Naral Pro-Choice America , told reporters that senators “ need to be examining their conscience and their moral maps and stand with us . And if they don ’ t , they need to examine their political futures . ”
Some activists are calling for Democrats to adopt a scorched-earth policy and block confirmation at all costs . But 62 % of Americans want a new justice in place before the November midterms , according to an NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll .
Levey said : “ The Democrats have very little chance of stopping the nominee where they are . They have to put on a show for their base but I suspect , when it ’ s over , we ’ ll be surprised that it was not a fight to the death , just a fight to clawing each other ’ s eyes out . ”
Meanwhile , conservatives are poised to target three Democrats seeking re-election in November in states that Trump won overwhelmingly in 2016 : Indiana ’ s Joe Donnelly , West Virginia ’ s Joe Manchin and North Dakota ’ s Heidi Heitkamp , all of whom attended a recent White House meeting with the president .

Or he could tap a younger Republican who is politically moderate enough to appeal to Democrats but would still hem in Republicans. Gov. Brian Sandoval of Nevada supports abortion rights and, after the court’s same-sex marriage decision last year, said his state’s arguments “against marriage equality are no longer defensible.” He is also from a fast-growing and increasingly diverse swing state, is Hispanic and was state attorney general and a federal judge before becoming governor.",www.nytimes.com,left,wvFHDF1Gepoxc8c9

A key provision in one of the U.S.’s best known civil rights laws, the Voting Rights Act, received a highly skeptical and sometimes downright hostile response from the conservative justices at the Supreme Court on Wednesday.

During contentious oral arguments, several liberal justices argued vigorously in favor of preserving a portion of the 1965 law which requires parts or all of 16 states to get permission from the Justice Department or a court before changing voting requirements or redrawing election districts.

However, the court’s conservatives seemed persuaded that when Congress renewed the Voting Rights Act for another 25 years in 2006, lawmakers lacked a sufficient basis for essentially keeping as is the list of states subject to the unusual pre-approval rule, known as Section 5.

Justice Antonin Scalia argued that the court needed to step in because the overwhelming, bipartisan vote in favor of renewing the law in 2006 showed that lawmakers were reluctant to disturb what amounted to a “racial entitlement.”

“I think it is attributable, very likely attributable, to a phenomenon that is called perpetuation of racial entitlement,” Scalia said. “Whenever a society adopts racial entitlements, it is very difficult to get out of them through the normal political processes….This is not the kind of a question you can leave to Congress. There are certain districts in the House that are black districts by law just about now.”

The conservative justices seemed to have the votes to strike the provision down.

Scalia suggested that regardless of the facts, lawmakers were very reluctant to disturb the law for fear for being accused of racism. “Even the name of it is wonderful: the Voting Rights Act,” he said sarcastically. “Who is going to vote against that in the future?”

No other justice responded immediately to Scalia’s comments, but Justice Sonia Sotomayor made clear a few minutes later that she was irked by Scalia’s language.

“Do you think that the right to vote is a racial entitlement in Section 5?…Do you think Section 5 was voted for because it was a racial entitlement?” she asked lawyer Bert Rein, who argued for Alabama’s Shelby County that the provision should be struck down.

“No,” said Rein, who said the measure was Congress’s response “to a problem of race discrimination which it thought was prevalent in certain jurisdictions.”

Earlier, Rein began his argument by arguing that there had been “unmistakable” change in the South in the nearly half-century since the the law was passed.

That assertion, too, provoked Sotomayor.

“Assuming some portions of the South have changed, your county pretty much hasn’t,” she interjected. She said Rein was arguing for “a county whose record is the epitome of what caused the passage of the [law] in the first place.”

“You may be the wrong party bringing this,” Sotomayor said .

Justice Elena Kagan noted that Alabama has no statewide officials who are black. “You’re objecting to a [coverage] formula, but any formula Congress could devise would capture Alabama,” she said.",www.politico.com,left,pYA8Ffjic1JUhsmc

The First Amendment makes it unconstitutional for government officials to retaliate against you because they dislike your speech. At the same time, federal law gives you the right to sue state officials for compensation if they violate constitutional rights such as your right to free speech. But on Tuesday, the Supreme Court invented a rule that will often allow police officers to arrest people in retaliation for disfavored speech without liability.

By enabling police officers to target viewpoints they dislike with near impunity, the decision could be catastrophic for protesters and the press. The justices, meanwhile, didn’t even try to ground their decision in the text or history of the statute they were interpreting. Instead, the court was surprisingly frank about its rationale: The justices simply don’t want police officers to have to defend themselves in court against these types of allegations.

In Nieves v. Bartlett, a divided court ruled that individuals can’t sue police officers for retaliatory arrest if those officers had probable cause to arrest them for any crime, no matter how minor—and that’s true even if the real reason for the arrest was speech the officers didn’t like. In other words, if you are jaywalking in violation of a local ordinance, officers can arrest you without fear of liability even if they’re making the arrest only because you’re participating in a Black Lives Matter demonstration or wearing a “Make America Great Again” cap.

Because local laws are full of minor infractions, like “loitering,” that are frequently violated without incident, police will often have a pretext to arrest people engaged in speech the officers don’t like. By immunizing such abuse, Nieves may have devastating effects on demonstrators, press photographers, and anyone who wants to exercise their speech rights in public, like the right to film the police or verbally challenge officer misconduct.

In a fractured media environment, the best way to get attention is often to provoke the other side into attacking you.

Why did Clinton do it?

I realize that a question like that needs to be a lot more specific, so let’s try again.

Why did Hillary Clinton tweet this on Wednesday?

I want to be sure we're all clear about something that Brett Kavanaugh said in his confirmation hearings last week. He referred to birth-control pills as ""abortion-inducing drugs.""

There was a hitch, though.

This claim — that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh considers birth-control pills to be “abortion-inducing drugs” — had been widely debunked when California senator Kamala Harris tried to peddle it with a deceptively edited video.

Kavanaugh had been describing the views of specific plaintiffs in a specific case, Priests for Life v. HHS. “It’s pretty clear from the context,” the Washington Post’s fact-checker, Glenn Kessler, wrote, “that he was quoting the views of the plaintiffs rather than offering a personal view.” He gave Harris four Pinocchios — the worst rating.

And with a ruling expected in the midst of a presidential election year , the case puts the high court at the center of one of the most politically charged issues since the start of President Trump ’ s term .
TRUMP DECISION TO END DACA WAS LAWFUL , JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAYS
For the administration and Dreamers alike , it all comes down to the Supreme Court , where Trump picks Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch now sit . Federal appeals courts across the country have rejected efforts to phase out the Obama-era program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , or DACA , but the administration has looked to the high court for support .
`` The administration has basically chalked up the fact that they are going to lose a lot of these cases in the lower courts , '' said Thomas Dupree , a former top Bush Justice Department official and now an appellate attorney .
`` But they 're playing the long game . I think that there are those in the White House and the Justice Department who have made a calculation saying , ‘ Look we can absorb all these losses in the lower courts because we are going to win the endgame when this case gets into the Supreme Court . ’ ”
It remains to be seen how the court will rule , however , on this complicated issue -- which concerns the limits of one president trying to rescind the policies of his predecessor .
Created under executive order , DACA gives some undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children the opportunity to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and become eligible for a work permit .
`` The reason the [ Trump administration ] gave was their belief that it was illegal to have such a program that gives protected status to a group of people who are not here legally , '' said Paul Smith , a Georgetown Law professor who has argued cases before the Supreme Court . `` They were caught between the political reality that they did n't want to dump on the Dreamers , but they still wanted to get rid of DACA as Obama 's policy .

An estimated 700,000 young adults currently in the DACA program could be affected , with a ruling for the administration potentially putting them at risk for deportation once again .
The Trump administration announced its plan to phase out the program in 2017 , only for the federal courts to rule that it could not apply retroactively and that DACA should be restarted in full . The White House fought back on those decisions , saying the president has broad authority over immigration enforcement policy .
DACA proponents have argued that Trump ’ s planned termination violates federal law requiring adequate notice-and-comment periods before certain federal rules are changed , as well as other constitutional equal protection and due process guarantees .

""But they're playing the long game. I think that there are those in the White House and the Justice Department who have made a calculation saying, ‘Look we can absorb all these losses in the lower courts because we are going to win the endgame when this case gets into the Supreme Court.’”

Created under executive order, DACA gives some undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children the opportunity to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and become eligible for a work permit.

The Supreme Court took the unusual step of taking up the cases before they had been fully heard at the lower court level. Those federal courts have issued nationwide injunctions, blocking the administration's plans, at least for now.

The Arguments

The Trump administration argues that the DACA program is not working and is unlawful, and that the president should have the ""absolute discretion"" to adopt a revised overall immigration strategy.

""Given the unacceptably high numbers of illegal border crossings,"" the Justice Department wrote in its appeal to the Supreme Court, ""it was critically important for DHS [Department of Homeland Security] to project a message that leaves no doubt regarding the clear, consistent, and transparent enforcement of the immigration laws against all classes and categories of aliens.""

Hundreds of pro-DACA demonstrators are expected to rally Tuesday outside the Supreme Court while arguments are taking place.

The Impact

Among those anxiously awaiting the Supreme Court's decision is Daniela, a college student in Washington, D.C. She asked her last name not be used.

""It's really sad thinking that by the time I graduate I might not even be able to be a teacher,"" she told Fox News in a recent interview. ""It's frustrating for sure. And so I really hope that something can change within the next few months.""

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — Thirteen cases remain to be decided at the Supreme Court this month, but all eyes are on three of them.

With the tumultuous 2015-16 term marked by Justice Antonin Scalia's death winding down, decisions on access to abortion, the use of affirmative action in college admissions, and the fate of millions of undocumented immigrants will determine whether the evenly-divided court tilted liberal or conservative. Other cases still pending before the eight-member court include one that could set a higher bar for public corruption and another that could affect drunk drivers who refuse breath or blood tests.

Last week, the court released six decisions, one of which denied Puerto Rico's effort to restructure more than $20 billion of its $72 billion debt. The justices also ruled that companies doing business with the government can be sued for fraud if they fail to disclose significant legal or regulatory violations.

The court has struggled at times with an even number of justices, prompting several tie votes, some compromise rulings on divisive issues and more caution in granting cases for next term.

Here's a look at the big three cases:

Affirmative action

A former white student's challenge to the University of Texas' use of racial preferences in admissions dates back the longest. The case was heard in early December, after being returned to the Supreme Court for a second go-round. In 2013, the justices demanded tougher judicial scrutiny of the school's use of race, but an appeals court again sided with UT.

Unlike the other cases, this one will be decided by just seven justices, because Justice Elena Kagan has recused herself after working on it as U.S. solicitor general. Without the risk of a tie, advocates and opponents of affirmative action anticipate a ruling for or against the policy — perhaps with repercussions for other universities as well. The betting line tilts slightly against UT.

Supreme Court skeptical of racial preferences in university admissions

Abortion

Another case from Texas challenges a state law that imposed major restrictions on abortion clinics, ostensibly to protect women's health. The law requires clinics to meet the same standards as ambulatory surgical centers and forces doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals — rules that threaten to leave only nine fully functioning abortion clinics in a state with 5.4 million women of reproductive age.

Two lower federal courts have upheld the law, but abortion rights proponents say it places too great a burden on women seeking abortions, without a justifiable health benefit. They may have a winning hand if Justice Anthony Kennedy joins the court's four liberals against one or both restrictions. A substantive ruling could represent the most significant abortion decision by the court since 1992.

Supreme Court closely divided on abortion case

Immigration

Case number three from Texas is President Obama's effort to overturn lower court rulings that have blocked him from offering more than 4 million undocumented immigrants a chance to remain in the country without fear of deportation. It represents his last chance to help the parents of those brought to the country as children who have already won such a reprieve.

Texas led a group of 26 states against the plan, complaining that it would have to pay for driver's licenses if the parents dodge deportation proceedings. Obama's best chance appears to be the hope that a majority of justices will decide the cost of licenses does not give Texas sufficient standing in court. Otherwise, a 4-4 tie would uphold the verdict of the lower courts, and the program would be dead.

In an upcoming documentary , “ Created Equal : Clarence Thomas In His Own Words , ” Thomas describes his faith , his political awakening , his judicial philosophy , and the role race has played in his life , offering viewers rare insight into the mind of a justice known for his reticence on the public stage .
“ ‘ This is the wrong black guy , he has to be destroyed , ' ” Thomas says at one point in the film , characterizing those who opposed his nomination to the Supreme Court nomination in 1991 . “ Just say it . And now at least we ’ re honest with each other. ” Remembering the moment that Anita Hill ’ s allegations that he had sexually harassed her were made public , Thomas says , that ’ s when “ all heck broke loose . ”
The new documentary , which TIME saw in an intimate advance screening , will be released in 2020 and set to air on PBS in May . It was made by Manifold Productions , which is led by Michael Pack , a conservative filmmaker who has worked with Steve Bannon . President Donald Trump nominated Pack to be the head of the Broadcasting Board of Governors .
The film is largely sympathetic to Thomas . On its website , Manifold Productions says the purpose of the movie is to “ tell the Clarence Thomas story truly and fully , without cover-ups or distortions. ” Thomas and his wife Virginia are the only people whose interviews appear in the film . ( Other voices , including Hill ’ s , are included in old footage . )

But a significant section of the movie also revisits Thomas ’ s contentious confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee , which was at the time overseen by then-Delaware Senator Joe Biden , who is now running for president . “ One of the things you do in hearings is you have to sit there and look attentively at people you know have no idea what they ’ re talking about , ” Thomas says , in reference to a line of questioning from Biden .

In an upcoming documentary, “Created Equal: Clarence Thomas In His Own Words,” Thomas describes his faith, his political awakening, his judicial philosophy, and the role race has played in his life, offering viewers rare insight into the mind of a justice known for his reticence on the public stage.

“‘This is the wrong black guy, he has to be destroyed,'” Thomas says at one point in the film, characterizing those who opposed his nomination to the Supreme Court nomination in 1991. “Just say it. And now at least we’re honest with each other.” Remembering the moment that Anita Hill’s allegations that he had sexually harassed her were made public, Thomas says, that’s when “all heck broke loose.”

The new documentary, which TIME saw in an intimate advance screening, will be released in 2020 and set to air on PBS in May. It was made by Manifold Productions, which is led by Michael Pack, a conservative filmmaker who has worked with Steve Bannon. President Donald Trump nominated Pack to be the head of the Broadcasting Board of Governors.

The film is largely sympathetic to Thomas. On its website, Manifold Productions says the purpose of the movie is to “tell the Clarence Thomas story truly and fully, without cover-ups or distortions.” Thomas and his wife Virginia are the only people whose interviews appear in the film. (Other voices, including Hill’s, are included in old footage.)

Pack interviewed Thomas for more than 30 hours over a six month period. Speaking after a screening on Oct. 22, he said he worried that including other original interviews would cause him to “lose Justice Thomas’s voice.” “I felt it would also let viewers make up their own mind,” Pack says. “My deal with the audience was to let Justice Thomas tell his story and be fair to his story.”

The Supreme Court must reverse the ruling of a lower court in Love Terminal Partners v. United States.

While public attention is riveted on Democrats with extravagant proposals for government expansion — a Green New Deal, single-payer health care, tuition-free college — few observers have noticed a recent federal court ruling that will, absent Supreme Court intervention, grant the government immense powers to confiscate private property in violation of the Fifth Amendment.

The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution mandates that private property cannot be taken for public use “without just compensation.” But this clause was eviscerated by U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Love Terminal Partners v. United States, which held that any property not earning a current positive cash flow can be taken by the government without a dime of compensation. Unless this ruling is reversed on appeal, it will have a devastating impact on the value of millions of properties with excellent prospects for appreciation but no current tenants. And it will put all real-estate investments not earning money at risk of being stolen by the government.

supreme_court,Christian Science Monitor,1,http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2016/0316/Merrick-Garland-raises-prospect-of-a-centrist-Supreme-Court-video,Merrick Garland raises prospect of a centrist Supreme Court,2016-03-16,Henry Gass,"With the most prized United States Supreme Court vacancy in a generation hanging in the balance , President Obama announced his nominee to fill it – a moderate , veteran federal judge – on Wednesday morning .
Whether Merrick Garland , chief judge of the D.C . Circuit Court of Appeals , gets to fill that vacancy remains unclear . On Wednesday , two Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee , Orrin Hatch and Jeff Flake , said that Chief Judge Garland might get a hearing during the lame-duck session of Congress after the election .
That offers the nominee some hope , even as he faces potentially one of the longest and toughest confirmation processes in history . If he manages to make it through , he could have a significant effect on the court .
Since the unexpected death of conservative stalwart Justice Antonin Scalia , legal experts have said the next justice could help define the ideological identity of the nation ’ s highest court for the next generation .
If Garland is appointed – which remains a big if , given Republican senators ’ vow not to hold hearings – his track record as a centrist suggests that the court may not shift radically to the left , as conservatives may fear , or maintain the center-right position it has held in recent decades .
Instead , experts say Garland could become another moderate `` swing vote '' like Justice Anthony Kennedy , a shift that could see the court become much more malleable based on the individual cases it 's deciding .
`` I still think the court would live at the center , '' writes Stephen Vladeck , a professor at the American University Washington College of Law and a Supreme Court expert , in an e-mail to the Monitor , `` but perhaps with a more diverse set of coalitions in different cases than over the past decade , where it was almost always Justice Kennedy whose vote drove the outcome . ''
Professor Vladeck writes that Garland ’ s impact would likely `` be very specific to the subject-matter in question . ''
Garland would certainly shift the court to the left on most social issues , experts say , but he may be more conservative on criminal justice issues .
SCOTUSblog 's Tom Goldstein wrote that Garland `` rarely votes in favor of criminal defendants ’ appeals of their convictions . ''
If he were confirmed , Garland and Kennedy `` would become the most-watched justices on the court . As they go , so goes the court , '' Timothy O'Neill , a professor at the John Marshall Law School in Chicago , writes in an e-mail to the Monitor .
And given the absence of Justice Scalia , who was among the most prominent conservative voices in court history , even a slightly ambiguous shift would be significant .
`` Even a modest liberal will make a sea change in the court compared to one with Justice Scalia , '' writes Jay Wexler , a professor at the Boston University Law School , in an e-mail .
Garland began his career clerking for Justice William Brennan , a liberal stalwart of the court , before moving onto private firm Arnold & Porter . After making partner , he left the firm to become a federal prosecutor , eventually rising to direct the investigation and prosecution of the Oklahoma City bombers and Unabomber Ted Kaczynski in the 1990s .
He was confirmed to the D.C . Circuit on a 76-to-23 vote in 1997 , with 32 Republicans senators voting for him , including seven who are still in the chamber .
In his remarks in the Rose Garden Wednesday , Garland choked up as he spoke about how his experience with the Oklahoma City bombings continues to guide his judicial philosophy today .
`` I saw up close the devastation that can happen when someone abandons the justice system as a way of absolving grievances and instead takes matters into his own hands , '' he said , referring to the bomber , Timothy McVeigh , who carried out the attacks in protest of government overreach .
`` [ A judge ] must put aside his personal views and preferences and follow law , not make it , '' he added . `` Fidelity to the Constitution and the law has been the cornerstone of my professional life , and is the hallmark of the kind of judge I have tried to be for past 18 years . If the Senate sees fit to confirm me ... I promise to continue on that course . ''
Having served on the D.C . Circuit for 19 years , and as chief judge for three years , Garland has more federal judicial experience than any Supreme Court nominee in history . SCOTUSblog 's Tom Goldstein wrote in 2010 that his time on the bench shows that he `` is essentially the model , neutral judge . He is acknowledged by all to be brilliant . His opinions avoid unnecessary , sweeping pronouncements . ''
With the implications for American constitutional law – particularly on hot-button issues such as campaign finance , affirmative action , and religious freedom – so significant , the political machines of both sides of the aisle have gone into overdrive . Both the Republican and Democratic parties began planning multimillion-dollar campaigns around the nomination weeks before any nominee was announced .
While Professor Wexler doubts Garland will get appointed , he adds that the judge would `` become a fairly reliable liberal vote in most kinds of cases . ''
`` Although Garland 's voice might not be strikingly liberal , his votes likely will be , '' he adds .
The significance of that fact has not escaped Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell , who in a statement released shortly after Mr. Obama 's announcement maintained his pledge to not hold a hearing for any nominee named by the current president .
`` The next justice could fundamentally alter the direction of the Supreme Court and have a profound impact on our country , so of course the American people should have a say in the Court ’ s direction , '' he said in the statement . `` It is a President 's constitutional right to nominate a Supreme Court justice , and it is the Senate 's constitutional right to act as a check on a President and withhold its consent . ''

`` If President Obama had any shot at a nominee being confirmed before November , Garland is about as strong a candidate as he could have put forward , '' he adds .","With the most prized United States Supreme Court vacancy in a generation hanging in the balance, President Obama announced his nominee to fill it – a moderate, veteran federal judge – on Wednesday morning.

Whether Merrick Garland, chief judge of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, gets to fill that vacancy remains unclear. On Wednesday, two Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Orrin Hatch and Jeff Flake, said that Chief Judge Garland might get a hearing during the lame-duck session of Congress after the election.

That offers the nominee some hope, even as he faces potentially one of the longest and toughest confirmation processes in history. If he manages to make it through, he could have a significant effect on the court.

Since the unexpected death of conservative stalwart Justice Antonin Scalia, legal experts have said the next justice could help define the ideological identity of the nation’s highest court for the next generation.

If Garland is appointed – which remains a big if, given Republican senators’ vow not to hold hearings – his track record as a centrist suggests that the court may not shift radically to the left, as conservatives may fear, or maintain the center-right position it has held in recent decades.

Instead, experts say Garland could become another moderate ""swing vote"" like Justice Anthony Kennedy, a shift that could see the court become much more malleable based on the individual cases it's deciding.

""I still think the court would live at the center,"" writes Stephen Vladeck, a professor at the American University Washington College of Law and a Supreme Court expert, in an e-mail to the Monitor, ""but perhaps with a more diverse set of coalitions in different cases than over the past decade, where it was almost always Justice Kennedy whose vote drove the outcome.""

Professor Vladeck writes that Garland’s impact would likely ""be very specific to the subject-matter in question.""

Garland would certainly shift the court to the left on most social issues, experts say, but he may be more conservative on criminal justice issues.

SCOTUSblog's Tom Goldstein wrote that Garland ""rarely votes in favor of criminal defendants’ appeals of their convictions.""

If he were confirmed, Garland and Kennedy ""would become the most-watched justices on the court. As they go, so goes the court,"" Timothy O'Neill, a professor at the John Marshall Law School in Chicago, writes in an e-mail to the Monitor.

And given the absence of Justice Scalia, who was among the most prominent conservative voices in court history, even a slightly ambiguous shift would be significant.

""Even a modest liberal will make a sea change in the court compared to one with Justice Scalia,"" writes Jay Wexler, a professor at the Boston University Law School, in an e-mail.

Garland began his career clerking for Justice William Brennan, a liberal stalwart of the court, before moving onto private firm Arnold & Porter. After making partner, he left the firm to become a federal prosecutor, eventually rising to direct the investigation and prosecution of the Oklahoma City bombers and Unabomber Ted Kaczynski in the 1990s.

He was confirmed to the D.C. Circuit on a 76-to-23 vote in 1997, with 32 Republicans senators voting for him, including seven who are still in the chamber.

In his remarks in the Rose Garden Wednesday, Garland choked up as he spoke about how his experience with the Oklahoma City bombings continues to guide his judicial philosophy today.

""I saw up close the devastation that can happen when someone abandons the justice system as a way of absolving grievances and instead takes matters into his own hands,"" he said, referring to the bomber, Timothy McVeigh, who carried out the attacks in protest of government overreach.

""[A judge] must put aside his personal views and preferences and follow law, not make it,"" he added. ""Fidelity to the Constitution and the law has been the cornerstone of my professional life, and is the hallmark of the kind of judge I have tried to be for past 18 years. If the Senate sees fit to confirm me ... I promise to continue on that course.""

Having served on the D.C. Circuit for 19 years, and as chief judge for three years, Garland has more federal judicial experience than any Supreme Court nominee in history. SCOTUSblog's Tom Goldstein wrote in 2010 that his time on the bench shows that he ""is essentially the model, neutral judge. He is acknowledged by all to be brilliant. His opinions avoid unnecessary, sweeping pronouncements.""

With the implications for American constitutional law – particularly on hot-button issues such as campaign finance, affirmative action, and religious freedom – so significant, the political machines of both sides of the aisle have gone into overdrive. Both the Republican and Democratic parties began planning multimillion-dollar campaigns around the nomination weeks before any nominee was announced.

While Professor Wexler doubts Garland will get appointed, he adds that the judge would ""become a fairly reliable liberal vote in most kinds of cases.""

""Although Garland's voice might not be strikingly liberal, his votes likely will be,"" he adds.

The significance of that fact has not escaped Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, who in a statement released shortly after Mr. Obama's announcement maintained his pledge to not hold a hearing for any nominee named by the current president.

""The next justice could fundamentally alter the direction of the Supreme Court and have a profound impact on our country, so of course the American people should have a say in the Court’s direction,"" he said in the statement. ""It is a President's constitutional right to nominate a Supreme Court justice, and it is the Senate's constitutional right to act as a check on a President and withhold its consent.""

On Wednesday, five Republican senators, including Sens. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Susan Collins of Maine, agreed to meet with Garland.

In a political climate as heated as this, Garland may be Obama’s best chance of filling the vacancy before he leaves office.

""Based on his age, his prosecutorial and lengthy judicial experience, his centrism, and his other characteristics, Chief Judge Garland is a nominee who simply cannot be opposed on the merits,"" writes Vladeck.

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court came down against double taxation Monday in a case that could cost some states and cities millions of dollars.

The justices sided with taxpayers over governments in a case that tested Maryland's income tax system, which does not grant a full credit to residents who also pay income taxes in states where they work.

Maryland is among the few that collect some income taxes on residents who work out of state. Among others that could be affected are North Carolina and Wisconsin, along with New York City, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Detroit, St. Louis, Kansas City and Wilmington, Del., according to a brief filed by the International Municipal Lawyers Association.

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court's defense of religious freedom may be on the decline.

Still reeling from the death of its most devout justice, Antonin Scalia, the high court has put preventing discrimination above protecting religion in a series of cases over the past year, from same-sex marriage to abortion and contraception.

It took an obscure order issued on the last day of the recent term for Justice Samuel Alito to drive home the point. By refusing to consider a family-owned pharmacy's objection to a Washington state regulation forcing it to stock and sell emergency contraceptives, he warned, the court was sending an ""ominous sign.""

Supreme Court refuses to hear another case on contraceptives

""If this is a sign of how religious liberty claims will be treated in the years ahead, those who value religious freedom have cause for great concern."" Alito said.

Indeed, to some groups that work at the intersection of law and religion, the court appears to be taking a left turn on issues where it has steered right in the past — a trend that, if it continues, could affect an upcoming case involving a Missouri church's effort to qualify for state playground funds and potentially another challenge to the pharmacy rule.

Under Chief Justices William Rehnquist and John Roberts, the court generally has carved out protections for religious groups and individuals. In recent years, it ruled that a Missouri church could sidestep employment discrimination laws, private corporations could avoid federal health regulations regarding contraceptives, and a New York town could open meetings with Christian prayers.

Last year, it ruled in favor of a Muslim prisoner who sought to wear a beard, a Muslim woman denied a job because she wore a headscarf, and a tiny Arizona church that protested municipal restrictions on street signs.

But after ruling for the craft giant Hobby Lobby in the 2014 contraceptives case, the court did not side with religious non-profits or the government this year in similar cases, instead sending them back for further appellate review. It struck down Texas restrictions on abortion clinics and, on the final day of the term, refused to hear the pharmacy's petition.

Seeing 'red flags'

That case was brought by the Stormans family, which operates Ralph's Thriftway in Olympia, Wash. The family had what conservatives considered a slam-dunk case against a unusual state regulation that pharmacies must fill prescriptions for contraceptives, including morning-after pills that prevent a fertilized egg from reaching the uterus.

""Ralph’s has made a strong case ... that the regulations here are improperly designed to stamp out religious objectors,"" Alito wrote in his dissent, joined by Roberts and Justice Clarence Thomas. In his final footnote, Alito invited another legal challenge.

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — There is no vacancy at the Supreme Court, but liberal and conservative activists are ready to do battle over one.

The potential retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy — the deciding vote on dozens of controversial cases over a 30-year career — has energized both sides for what likely would be the most divisive confirmation battle in decades.

Strategy sessions are being held with increasing frequency. Commercial messages are being crafted in favor and against any potential nominee. Moderate senators on both sides of the political aisle whose votes will be critical already have targets on their backs.

Unlike last year, when Justice Neil Gorsuch of Colorado was confirmed to the seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, a fellow conservative, any nominee chosen by President Trump would push the court further to the right. That has liberal interest groups on high alert.

""It’s hard to fathom something more important to our rights and freedoms, and especially at this critical time for our democracy,"" says Kristine Lucius, executive vice president for policy at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition of more than 200 organizations. ""I think you would see engagement larger than you've seen in recent memory.""

Conservative groups that came together in the $17 million campaign leading to Gorsuch's confirmation a year ago are prepared for a similar effort to unify Republicans around the next nominee.

“We have a policy of always being ready,"" says Carrie Severino, chief counsel at the Judicial Crisis Network, which ran television ads in key states aimed at pressuring wavering Republicans and Democrats. ""We are prepared for a vacancy, whenever that might be.”

Both sides are ready for a reason. The last justices to retire, David Souter and John Paul Stevens, announced their plans in April 2009 and 2010. Their successors, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, were nominated in May, confirmed in August and hearing cases by October.

The court concluded the term's oral arguments Wednesday with another high-profile case to which Kennedy likely holds the key — Trump's immigration travel ban on five predominantly Muslim countries. Kennedy's wife, Mary, watched from a special guest seat.

The preparation, however, may be for naught. Kennedy, 81, has been tight-lipped about his plans, and his clout as the court's swing vote is at its zenith. With Senate Republicans holding only a 51-49 edge and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., seriously ill with brain cancer, Kennedy — nominated to the court in 1987 by President Reagan — may decide now is not the time to drop the legal equivalent of a nuclear bomb.

If he calls it quits, attention swiftly will turn to those believed to be atop Trump's list of 25 potential replacements. They include federal appeals court judges Brett Kavanaugh of the District of Columbia, Thomas Hardiman of Pennsylvania, Raymond Kethledge of Michigan, Amy Coney Barrett of Indiana and Amul Thapar of Kentucky.

""Our goal will be to humanize that person by telling their story right away,"" says Ron Bonjean, a former top adviser to House and Senate Republican leaders who helped with Gorsuch's confirmation. ""And television advertising is going to be a big part of that.”

A conservative nominee could create what Supreme Court expert Lee Epstein at Washington University School of Law has said would be the most conservative court in 80 years. For that reason, liberals would do their best to defeat the nomination.

Says Nan Aron, president of the liberal Alliance for Justice: “It would be malpractice on our part not to be ready.”

Emphasis on social issues

Trump's opportunity to replace Kennedy, if it comes, would motivate Democrats in much the same way that President Obama's attempt to replace Scalia in 2016 moved Republicans. That's because Kennedy, while conservative on business cases and others, has been a liberal — and decisive — voice on social issues such as abortion and gay rights.

“It will make everything that has happened previously look small,” says Anita Dunn, a senior partner at SKDKnickerbocker, the strategic communications firm at the fulcrum of opposition to Gorsuch last year.

While that ended in defeat, liberals hope improved planning, marketing and particularly fundraising will be more effective the second time around. They plan to model the effort on the successful ""Protect Our Care"" campaign to stop Republicans in Congress from repealing Obamacare.

Expect to hear a lot about abortion rights, which Kennedy helped to protect in a 2016 case from Texas, and gay rights, three years after Kennedy wrote the 5-4 opinion legalizing same-sex marriage. Pro-choice Republican senators such as Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska would be prime targets.

""The easiest way to lose one of them is abortion,"" says Curt Levey, president of the conservative Committee for Justice.

Liberals also hope to use public support for gun control, as well as the court's potential role in cases involving Trump as president, candidate or businessman, as reasons to oppose his nominee.

But they also would tap supporters of gay rights, women's rights, environmental protection and other popular left-wing causes.

“We have fewer billionaires than they do, and we have fewer millionaires than they do,"" says Ian Millhiser, a legal analyst at the liberal Center for American Progress. ""We have less money to go around.”

'Success follows success'

Conservative groups had to defend Scalia's seat in 2016-17 by opposing Obama's nominee, federal appeals court Judge Merrick Garland, and championing Gorsuch. This time, they would be on offense, seeking to pick up a fifth solidly conservative justice.

Fortunately for Republicans, they control the White House and Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to consider Garland in 2016, then cleared the way for Gorsuch by abolishing the 60-vote requirement needed to bring Supreme Court nominations to the floor.

""Success follows success,"" Bonjean says. ""I think donors are going to be more emboldened to provide the necessary resources for television advertising and for grass-roots.”

White House counsel Don McGahn and outside adviser Leonard Leo, executive vice president of the Federalist Society, would play key roles along with the Judicial Crisis Network and the Kochs' grass-roots organization, fronted by Americans for Prosperity.

For now, both sides are waiting for Kennedy to tip his hand — and possibly tip the balance on the Supreme Court for years to come.

“We’re playing for a generation,"" Aron says. ""Whoever his successor is could well cement the right half on the court and the country for the next 40 years.”

supreme_court,CBS News,0,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-lgbtq-rights-cases-job-discrimination-arguments-today-2019-10-08/,Supreme Court takes up 2 landmark cases for LGBTQ rights,2019-10-08,,"A seemingly divided Supreme Court on Tuesday heard highly anticipated cases on whether federal civil rights law should apply to LGBTQ people , with Chief Justice John Roberts questioning how doing so would affect employers . In the first of two cases , the justices heard arguments on whether a federal law banning job discrimination on the basis of sex should also protect sexual orientation .
Lower courts have split on the issue . A related case on transgender employees was also being heard Tuesday .
Roberts , a possible swing vote in the cases , wondered about the implications of what he described as an expansion of the job-discrimination law . `` If we 're going to be expanding the definition of what 'sex ' covers , what do we do about that issue ? '' Roberts asked .
Justice Neil Gorsuch said the case seems close . He wondered whether the justices should consider `` the massive social upheaval '' that might follow a ruling in favor of LGBTQ employees .
Justice Samuel Alito , a conservative , suggested that the high court would be usurping the role of Congress by reading protection for sexual orientation into the 1964 Civil Rights Act , when lawmakers at the time likely envisioned they were doing no such thing . `` You 're trying to change the meaning of 'sex , ' '' he said .
Justice Elena Kagan , a liberal , suggested sexual orientation is a clear subset of sex discrimination , saying that a man who loves other men can not be treated differently by an employer than a woman who loves men .

In the first of two cases, the justices heard arguments on whether a federal law banning job discrimination on the basis of sex should also protect sexual orientation.

Lower courts have split on the issue. A related case on transgender employees was also being heard Tuesday.

Roberts, a possible swing vote in the cases, wondered about the implications of what he described as an expansion of the job-discrimination law. ""If we're going to be expanding the definition of what 'sex' covers, what do we do about that issue?"" Roberts asked.

Justice Neil Gorsuch said the case seems close. He wondered whether the justices should consider ""the massive social upheaval"" that might follow a ruling in favor of LGBTQ employees.

Justice Samuel Alito, a conservative, suggested that the high court would be usurping the role of Congress by reading protection for sexual orientation into the 1964 Civil Rights Act, when lawmakers at the time likely envisioned they were doing no such thing. ""You're trying to change the meaning of 'sex,'"" he said.

Justice Elena Kagan, a liberal, suggested sexual orientation is a clear subset of sex discrimination, saying that a man who loves other men cannot be treated differently by an employer than a woman who loves men.

The cases Tuesday are the court's first on LGBTQ rights since Justice Anthony Kennedy's retirement and replacement by Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Kennedy upheld gay rights as the author of the landmark ruling in 2015 that made same-sex marriage legal throughout the United States. Kavanaugh generally is regarded as more conservative.

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court refused Monday to review a federal judge's order that the Trump administration continue a program protecting undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children.

The denial leaves in place the popular DACA program, which has protected some 690,000 undocumented immigrants from deportation and enabled them to get work permits.

The program had faced a March 5 deadline for congressional action set by Trump last summer. Two federal courts have ruled the administration's action was illegal.

The justices could have agreed to hear the case this spring, leapfrogging a federal appeals court based in California that has been sympathetic to the cause of immigrants. They also could have overruled federal District Judge William Alsup without a hearing.

Instead, they simply allowed the case to run its normal course through the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.

""It is assumed that the Court of Appeals will proceed expeditiously to decide this case,"" the justices said in denying the Trump administration's petition. The case still could come to the high court in the future.

The action represents a temporary victory for the young adults brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents or guardians under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program established by President Barack Obama in 2012. And it represents a major setback for the Trump administration, which vowed to continue the legal battle in the lower courts.

“DACA is fully legal,"" Becerra said. “The Trump administration’s attempts to end it were fully illegal. And we hope that this has become clearer at each step of the way.”

The dispute dates back to 2012, when Obama established the program without congressional action. The goal was to protect from deportation undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children, but many Republicans called it executive overreach and have remained opposed to the program.

Trump vowed to end the program on the campaign trail, but seemed to change his mind after winning election. He went back and forth over the future of DACA during his first months in office, but made his decision in September: he announced that the program would end, but not until March 5, giving Congress six months to find a solution.

Democrats and Republicans have been squabbling over the fate of those so-called DREAMers ever since. Democrats want the program left alone or made permanent through a new law; Republicans, with Trump's backing, have demanded other immigration enforcement and border security enhancements in exchange, including an expansion of the wall along the Mexican border.

The negotiations have been tense, even leading to a three-day government shutdown in January as Democrats briefly demanded a DACA solution as part of a spending bill.

But now that the Supreme Court has decided not to fast-track the legal battle, the program will continue allowing DACA recipients to renew their protections. That eliminates the deadline faced by Congress.

The case now goes back to the 9th Circuit, which must consider the ruling from Alsup that preserved DACA.

In his ruling last month, Alsup granted a request by California, the University of California system, and several California cities to block Trump's decision to end the DACA program while their lawsuit challenging the program's termination plays out in court. He said those already approved for protection and work permits must be allowed to renew them before they expire.

Alsup said the challengers were likely to succeed by claiming that the Trump administration's decision to end the program was ""arbitrary and capricious"" and based on a flawed legal premise. He said the plaintiffs would be harmed, in part through economic disruptions and the loss of tax revenue caused by the DREAMers' change in status.

supreme_court,BBC News,1,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45673858,Kavanaugh hearing: A moment of reckoning for American women,,Georgina Rannard,"Even before Christine Blasey Ford accused Supreme Court choice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault , the nomination was said to be about women .
Appointing Mr Kavanaugh would tip the court 's balance in favour of Republicans . This sparked real fear amongst progressive women that landmark Roe v Wade decision that granted the right to abortion could be overturned .
In 2016 the potential for the first majority conservative line-up on the court in decades brought reluctant Trump voters to the ballot box .
Once Mr Kavanaugh denied Ms Ford 's allegations , the hearings became a test of how far the Me Too movement has changed America .
The BBC spoke to women before and after the extraordinary hearing to find out whether this is really about women 's rights . Did listening to Dr Ford and Mr Kavanaugh change their minds about who and what to believe ?
Already suspicious of Mr Kavanaugh 's social values , progressive women 's opposition escalated when sexual assault claims emerged .
Julia Peters , 33 , has been attending protests in Washington DC for a week .
`` This is n't someone we can elect out . He will be in there for a lifetime , and we know he does n't stand for our values , '' she said at Capitol Hill before the hearings began .
Grace Perret , a college junior , is from New Orleans , Louisiana , one of the four US states with a `` trigger law '' that mean abortion would be banned automatically if Roe v Wade was overturned .
`` This would have devastating implications for poor women especially , who likely can not afford to travel '' to other states to seek abortions , she explained .
The promise `` we believe women '' is core for Julia : `` We are here to let Christine Blasey Ford know we believe her . ''
There is anger at how quickly some on the right dismissed Dr Ford 's allegations , which have caused great distress to her family .
`` The attempts by so many on the right to paint this as a co-ordinated political smear campaign is incredibly damaging to the anti-rape culture movement and to survivors everywhere , '' commented Ms Perret .
But conservative women are deeply concerned about what they see as an abuse of the confirmation process .
Rachel Gill , 22 , went to Capitol Hill on Thursday to show her support for Mr Kavanaugh because she believes in the `` principle of innocent until proven guilty '' .
`` I absolutely do support women who have come forward to talk about these experiences , but I also think there needs to be proof if you 're going to take someone to court .
`` I 'm here because I want to hear the truth , and if there is any truth to these accusations , '' she explained .
Talk of a smear campaign against Mr Kavanaugh is common as some conservative women fear the assault allegations are being weaponised by Democrats who want to prevent Mr Kavanaugh 's confirmation .
Nancy Wilson , a grandmother of 11 , travelled to Washington from Fairfax County , Virginia , with two friends . Wearing `` I Stand With Brett '' T-shirts , they explained they believe women are being misused . They want Mr Kavanaugh on the court because he 's a `` constitutionalist judge '' .
`` The process is being abused . It 's become a circus . Sex should not be inserted into politics like this . Someone came along at the 11th hour with an accusation about something that happened 35 years ago , '' Nancy explained .
On Thursday the world finally heard from Dr Ford and Mr Kavanaugh , in tearful testimonies that took strikingly different tones .
# KavanaughHearings trended all day on social media , prompting survivors of sexual violence to tell their own stories , including a 76-year-old woman who called the TV network C-Span about her experience of rape .
After protesting outside the Senate , Chicago-born Lucy Melchor , 36 , watched the hearings .
`` I thought Ms Ford 's testimony was heartbreaking and compelling . It just reinforced that I believe her , '' she said .
`` When asked who committed the assault , she replied without skipping a beat . And I thought , she is there under oath , with her family life having been destroyed . What has she got to gain from this ? Her motive seemed pure and clear . ''
In contrast , she felt Mr Kavanaugh 's testimony turned the attention away from a woman 's claims of sexual assault to his anger about the political process .
`` I was really upset by the level of vitriol that he brought to this . It took the focus away from her and put it on politics . That was so difficult to see , '' she said .
But where progressives found Ms Ford powerfully believable , conservative women felt exactly the same about Mr Kavanaugh .
`` I think they both believe what they are saying . I believe that Ms Ford probably was assaulted but not by Mr Kavanaugh . My heart really does go out to Dr Ford , '' Rachel Gill explained .
Kay Lucien , one of the grandmothers who joined rallies on Capitol Hill , called Mr Kavanaugh 's comments `` compelling '' and `` passionate . '' Like the judge , Mrs Lucien has a strong religious faith .
`` I found it so moving that Mr Kavanaugh 's child would offer to pray for a woman who has brought so much pain to her family , '' she explained after the hearing .
While she feels sympathy for Dr Ford , she says her confidence in Mr Kavanaugh 's suitability for the court increased .
`` I would be pleased if the balance of the Supreme Court court changed in favour of conservatives - we 've seen our country slide in the other direction and we would like to move it back a little bit .

Even before Christine Blasey Ford accused Supreme Court choice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, the nomination was said to be about women.

Appointing Mr Kavanaugh would tip the court's balance in favour of Republicans. This sparked real fear amongst progressive women that landmark Roe v Wade decision that granted the right to abortion could be overturned.

In 2016 the potential for the first majority conservative line-up on the court in decades brought reluctant Trump voters to the ballot box.

Once Mr Kavanaugh denied Ms Ford's allegations, the hearings became a test of how far the Me Too movement has changed America.

The BBC spoke to women before and after the extraordinary hearing to find out whether this is really about women's rights. Did listening to Dr Ford and Mr Kavanaugh change their minds about who and what to believe?

Pivotal moment

Already suspicious of Mr Kavanaugh's social values, progressive women's opposition escalated when sexual assault claims emerged.

Julia Peters, 33, has been attending protests in Washington DC for a week.

""This isn't someone we can elect out. He will be in there for a lifetime, and we know he doesn't stand for our values,"" she said at Capitol Hill before the hearings began.

Grace Perret, a college junior, is from New Orleans, Louisiana, one of the four US states with a ""trigger law"" that mean abortion would be banned automatically if Roe v Wade was overturned.

""This would have devastating implications for poor women especially, who likely cannot afford to travel"" to other states to seek abortions, she explained.

The promise ""we believe women"" is core for Julia: ""We are here to let Christine Blasey Ford know we believe her.""

There is anger at how quickly some on the right dismissed Dr Ford's allegations, which have caused great distress to her family.

""The attempts by so many on the right to paint this as a co-ordinated political smear campaign is incredibly damaging to the anti-rape culture movement and to survivors everywhere,"" commented Ms Perret.

A circus

But conservative women are deeply concerned about what they see as an abuse of the confirmation process.

Rachel Gill, 22, went to Capitol Hill on Thursday to show her support for Mr Kavanaugh because she believes in the ""principle of innocent until proven guilty"".

""I absolutely do support women who have come forward to talk about these experiences, but I also think there needs to be proof if you're going to take someone to court.

""I'm here because I want to hear the truth, and if there is any truth to these accusations,"" she explained.

Talk of a smear campaign against Mr Kavanaugh is common as some conservative women fear the assault allegations are being weaponised by Democrats who want to prevent Mr Kavanaugh's confirmation.

Nancy Wilson, a grandmother of 11, travelled to Washington from Fairfax County, Virginia, with two friends. Wearing ""I Stand With Brett"" T-shirts, they explained they believe women are being misused. They want Mr Kavanaugh on the court because he's a ""constitutionalist judge"".

""The process is being abused. It's become a circus. Sex should not be inserted into politics like this. Someone came along at the 11th hour with an accusation about something that happened 35 years ago,"" Nancy explained.

Pure and clear

On Thursday the world finally heard from Dr Ford and Mr Kavanaugh, in tearful testimonies that took strikingly different tones.

#KavanaughHearings trended all day on social media, prompting survivors of sexual violence to tell their own stories, including a 76-year-old woman who called the TV network C-Span about her experience of rape.

Image caption Lucy Melchor (left) watched the hearings after rally for Christine Blasey Ford on Capitol Hill

After protesting outside the Senate, Chicago-born Lucy Melchor, 36, watched the hearings.

""I thought Ms Ford's testimony was heartbreaking and compelling. It just reinforced that I believe her,"" she said.

""When asked who committed the assault, she replied without skipping a beat. And I thought, she is there under oath, with her family life having been destroyed. What has she got to gain from this? Her motive seemed pure and clear.""

In contrast, she felt Mr Kavanaugh's testimony turned the attention away from a woman's claims of sexual assault to his anger about the political process.

""I was really upset by the level of vitriol that he brought to this. It took the focus away from her and put it on politics. That was so difficult to see,"" she said.

Increased confidence

But where progressives found Ms Ford powerfully believable, conservative women felt exactly the same about Mr Kavanaugh.

Image caption Ann Trible (left), Nancy Wilson (centre), and Kay Lucien (right) travelled from Virginia to show their support for Brett Kavanaugh

""I think they both believe what they are saying. I believe that Ms Ford probably was assaulted but not by Mr Kavanaugh. My heart really does go out to Dr Ford,"" Rachel Gill explained.

Kay Lucien, one of the grandmothers who joined rallies on Capitol Hill, called Mr Kavanaugh's comments ""compelling"" and ""passionate."" Like the judge, Mrs Lucien has a strong religious faith.

""I found it so moving that Mr Kavanaugh's child would offer to pray for a woman who has brought so much pain to her family,"" she explained after the hearing.

While she feels sympathy for Dr Ford, she says her confidence in Mr Kavanaugh's suitability for the court increased.

""I would be pleased if the balance of the Supreme Court court changed in favour of conservatives - we've seen our country slide in the other direction and we would like to move it back a little bit.

""I would worry less about losing some rights, such as religious rights and gun rights and a lot of things that seem to be attacked constantly in recent years,"" she added.

The hearings are also a moment of reckoning for women's rights in America.

Democrat Ms Melchor commented, ""It's now almost a year since the Me Too movement, and if the cards fall onto the side of not believing her story, it's really detrimental for the women who have been assaulted and will be assaulted in the future.

The US Supreme Court has quashed the conviction of a black death row inmate in Mississippi because the prosecution excluded black jurors.

The justices ruled 7-2 that Curtis Flowers' right to a fair trial had been violated.

Flowers, 49, has been tried six times for the murders of four furniture store workers in Winona, Mississippi, in 1996.

The state could still put him on trial a seventh time.

What happened in the trials?

Flowers was found guilty in his first three trials - the first one with an all-white jury and the next two with just one black juror. The fourth and fifth trials ended in mistrials.

Mississippi's Supreme Court overturned the first three convictions due to ""numerous instances of prosecutorial misconduct"", including discriminating against black jurors.

US prosecutors are able to dismiss a limited number of potential jurors at the start of a case without stating a reason, but a 1986 Supreme Court ruling made it illegal to do so on the basis of race.

In the sixth trial prosecutors disallowed five of six black jurors, which Flowers argued was discriminatory.

The Mississippi Supreme Court upheld the sixth conviction, but the US Supreme Court overturned it on Friday.

What did the US Supreme Court decision say?

Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who wrote the majority opinion, said the state had ""engaged in dramatically disparate questioning"" of prospective jurors based on race.

His opinion pointed out that one excluded black juror in particular, Carolyn Wright, was ""similarly situated"" to white jurors whom the prosecution did not oppose.

Justice Kavanaugh said the lower court had ""committed clear error"" by ruling that this selection ""was not 'motivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent'"".

In a concurring opinion, Justice Samuel Alito noted it was ""risky"" for the case to be tried ""once again by the same prosecutor"".

Montgomery County District Attorney Doug Evans, who is white, tried Flowers six times.

What did the dissenting justices say?

Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch disagreed.

In his dissent, Justice Thomas called the majority opinion ""manifestly incorrect"", saying it would prolong the ""nightmare"" of the victims' families.

He also noted the majority did not dispute the guilty verdict, or the impartiality of the jury - just the prosecutor's conduct.

Justice Thomas - who is the court's only African-American justice - pointed out that the defence had also used peremptory strikes to remove potential white jurors.

He wrote: ""If the Court's opinion today has a redeeming quality, it is this: The State is perfectly free to convict Curtis Flowers again.""

What happened in the quadruple murders?

The murders occurred on 16 July 1996 in Winona, Mississippi, a small town with a population of around 5,000 that is 53% black and 46% white.

Store owner Bertha Tardy, 59, deliveryman Robert Golden, 42, part-time employee Derrick Stewart, 16, and bookkeeper Carmen Rigby, 45, were shot and killed at the Tardy Furniture Store. Mr Golden was black; the other victims were white.

Flowers had worked at the store, but had recently been fired. Ms Tardy, the store owner, reportedly withheld his pay after firing him, and close to $300 was missing from the store after the murders.

He did not have an alibi for the morning of the murders, but had no prior criminal record. Eyewitness accounts and evidence at the scene were contested.

What's the reaction?

After the ruling, Benny Rigby, whose wife Carmen was killed in the shooting, told the Mississippi Clarion Ledger newspaper: ""There is no justice.""

""If he was white, he would have been executed by now,"" Mr Rigby added.

And he pointed out that he had linked to other similar artistic expressions , including a comedy sketch about the nature of threats , and rap songs from Eminem whose verse has fantasized about killing his ex-wife .
At the end of the trial , the judge instructed the jury that to convict , it must find that Elonis ' Facebook posts constituted true threats , meaning that in context `` a reasonable person would foresee that the statements would be interpreted ... as a serious expression of an intent to inflict bodily injury . ''
Elonis was convicted and sentenced to 44 months in prison . He appealed all the way to the Supreme Court , contending that under the Constitution and the federal threat statute , a jury must find not just that a reasonable person would interpret the words as threatening , but that Elonis actually intended his words to be threatening .
`` If the question had been what did he intend , did he intend to place her in fear , it would 've been an entirely different trial , '' says attorney John Elwood , who will argue the case in the Supreme Court on Monday .
Elwood points to evidence that he contends shows Elonis never intended to put his wife in fear for her life .
`` The disclaimer posted all around the page saying basically , 'this is all for entertainment purposes only ' or that 'this is venting , do n't take this too seriously , ' and when you put all that in context , '' it indicates `` he did not have an intent to put anyone in fear , '' argues Elwood .
Elwood notes that lots of great songs have revenge fantasies , including the Beatles ' `` Run for Your Life '' in which John Lennon sings , `` I 'd rather see you dead little girl than to see you with another man . ... Run , run for your life . ''
But longtime federal prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald sees the context in the Elonis case differently . He notes that most of the posts occurred after Elonis ' wife had gotten a protective court order , and that Elonis posted his messages on his Facebook page without restriction . Thus , Fitzgerald contends that the husband reasonably foresaw what the reaction would be .
`` The wife would read this and think , this is not an artistic statement , this is not a political statement about a larger cause , '' says Fitzgerald . `` This is trying to get inside her head and make her think there could be someone doing violence to her . ''
Fitzgerald also rejects the comparison to Eminem 's rap fantasies . You ca n't have `` this little out where you dress up a threat as being rap lyrics '' and are allowed to `` terrorize people , '' he says .
Fitzgerald , who served 24 years as a federal prosecutor — 11 of them as the U.S. attorney for Chicago — sees threats as such a problem that he actually put a `` threat button '' on his prosecutors ' computers in Chicago , requiring them to report any threat made to a witness , prosecutor or judge .
`` There 's an epidemic of threats out there , and with the Internet it 's going to get worse . So , in terms of the societal value of making sure there is a safe zone where people are n't picking up the Internet and feeling like they 're being singled out for violence , that 's a very real issue , '' he says .
Cindy Southworth , vice president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence , underlines the point , contending that Facebook and other social media sites enable abusers to reach their victims with a `` click of a mouse or the touch of a screen . ''
`` We have stalking statutes all over the country that are based on a reasonable person versus proving the intent of the stalker or abuser . So I 'm quite concerned about what ripple impact this may have on other statutes and other prosecutions if we have to somehow get into the mind of an abuser , '' she says .
But most of the friend-of-the-court briefs filed in the Elonis case take the opposite side . They argue that if the court allows this conviction to stand , it would have enormous implications for free speech rights and artistic expression . Briefs full of references to the F-word or female genitalia attempt to provide a crash course on rap storytelling for justices whose tastes , as one wag observed , run more to Wagner and Puccini than Eminem and Wu-Tang Clan .","Is A Threat Posted On Facebook Really A Threat?

The U.S. Supreme Court is tackling a question of increasing importance in the age of social media and the Internet: What constitutes a threat on Facebook?

Anthony Elonis was convicted of making threats against his estranged wife, and an FBI agent. After his wife left him, taking the couple's two children with her, Elonis began posting about her on his Facebook page.

There's one way to love ya, but a thousand ways to kill ya, And I'm not going to rest until your body is a mess, Soaked in blood and dying from all the little cuts. Hurry up and die bitch.

In another post Elonis opined, ""Revenge is a dish that is best served cold with a delicious side of psychological torture.""

Elonis' wife, Tara, went to court and, after a three-hour hearing attended by both husband and wife, she obtained a restraining order, barring her estranged husband from threatening, harassing or contacting her, even indirectly. Elonis, however, continued his unrestricted posting practices.

Just three days after the court hearing, he posted another Facebook message: ""Did you know that it's illegal for me to say I want to kill my wife?"" he wrote, explaining, ""Now, it was okay for me to say it right then because...I'm just letting you know that it's illegal for me to say that.""

He appealed all the way to the Supreme Court, contending that under the Constitution and the federal threat statute, a jury must find not just that a reasonable person would interpret the words as threatening, but that Elonis actually intended his words to be threatening.

""If the question had been what did he intend, did he intend to place her in fear, it would've been an entirely different trial,"" says attorney John Elwood, who will argue the case in the Supreme Court on Monday.

Elwood points to evidence that he contends shows Elonis never intended to put his wife in fear for her life.

""The disclaimer posted all around the page saying basically, 'this is all for entertainment purposes only' or that 'this is venting, don't take this too seriously,' and when you put all that in context,"" it indicates ""he did not have an intent to put anyone in fear,"" argues Elwood.

Elwood notes that lots of great songs have revenge fantasies, including the Beatles' ""Run for Your Life"" in which John Lennon sings, ""I'd rather see you dead little girl than to see you with another man. ... Run, run for your life.""

But longtime federal prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald sees the context in the Elonis case differently. He notes that most of the posts occurred after Elonis' wife had gotten a protective court order, and that Elonis posted his messages on his Facebook page without restriction. Thus, Fitzgerald contends that the husband reasonably foresaw what the reaction would be.

""The wife would read this and think, this is not an artistic statement, this is not a political statement about a larger cause,"" says Fitzgerald. ""This is trying to get inside her head and make her think there could be someone doing violence to her.""

Fitzgerald also rejects the comparison to Eminem's rap fantasies. You can't have ""this little out where you dress up a threat as being rap lyrics"" and are allowed to ""terrorize people,"" he says.

Fitzgerald, who served 24 years as a federal prosecutor — 11 of them as the U.S. attorney for Chicago — sees threats as such a problem that he actually put a ""threat button"" on his prosecutors' computers in Chicago, requiring them to report any threat made to a witness, prosecutor or judge.

""There's an epidemic of threats out there, and with the Internet it's going to get worse. So, in terms of the societal value of making sure there is a safe zone where people aren't picking up the Internet and feeling like they're being singled out for violence, that's a very real issue,"" he says.

Cindy Southworth, vice president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence, underlines the point, contending that Facebook and other social media sites enable abusers to reach their victims with a ""click of a mouse or the touch of a screen.""

""We have stalking statutes all over the country that are based on a reasonable person versus proving the intent of the stalker or abuser. So I'm quite concerned about what ripple impact this may have on other statutes and other prosecutions if we have to somehow get into the mind of an abuser,"" she says.

But most of the friend-of-the-court briefs filed in the Elonis case take the opposite side. They argue that if the court allows this conviction to stand, it would have enormous implications for free speech rights and artistic expression. Briefs full of references to the F-word or female genitalia attempt to provide a crash course on rap storytelling for justices whose tastes, as one wag observed, run more to Wagner and Puccini than Eminem and Wu-Tang Clan.

Dr. Blasey , 51 , a university professor in Northern California who is also known by her married name , Ford , has accused Judge Kavanaugh , 53 , of pinning her to a bed , groping her , trying to remove her clothing and covering her mouth to keep her from screaming during a party in the early 1980s when the two were teenagers in Maryland .

Another high school friend , Patrick J. Smyth , came forward on Wednesday , saying he was one of two other people Dr. Blasey identified being elsewhere in the house at the time of the alleged assault . In a letter to the Judiciary Committee , Mr. Smyth said he did not remember anything like it .
“ I have no knowledge of the party in question ; nor do I have any knowledge of the allegations of improper conduct she has leveled against Brett Kavanaugh , ” he wrote . He added , “ I have never witnessed any improper conduct by Brett Kavanaugh towards women . ”
With the conflict over the confirmation and the supercharged allegations taking place so close to the midterms , both sides were deeply anxious about the possible effect and were eager to blame the other . Republicans argued that they have given Dr. Blasey an opportunity to tell her story to the Senate , either in public or in private , while Democrats said the refusal to call in the F.B.I . showed that the president ’ s party was not really interested in finding the truth .
“ This process has been off the rails for a long time now , but the last 24 hours signal a new low , ” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse , Democrat of Rhode Island . He noted that Dr. Blasey has been harassed and forced to leave her own home since bringing her account to the public . “ In the face of this , Republicans are jamming her into a ‘ take it or leave it ’ kangaroo hearing without even the courtesy of proper investigation of her claims . It is a disgrace . ”","Still, the emergence of Dr. Blasey’s allegation may have cost Republicans the chance of winning support from any of the red-state Democrats they were hoping to enlist.

Another high school friend, Patrick J. Smyth, came forward on Wednesday, saying he was one of two other people Dr. Blasey identified being elsewhere in the house at the time of the alleged assault. In a letter to the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Smyth said he did not remember anything like it.

“I have no knowledge of the party in question; nor do I have any knowledge of the allegations of improper conduct she has leveled against Brett Kavanaugh,” he wrote. He added, “I have never witnessed any improper conduct by Brett Kavanaugh towards women.”

With the conflict over the confirmation and the supercharged allegations taking place so close to the midterms, both sides were deeply anxious about the possible effect and were eager to blame the other. Republicans argued that they have given Dr. Blasey an opportunity to tell her story to the Senate, either in public or in private, while Democrats said the refusal to call in the F.B.I. showed that the president’s party was not really interested in finding the truth.

“This process has been off the rails for a long time now, but the last 24 hours signal a new low,” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island. He noted that Dr. Blasey has been harassed and forced to leave her own home since bringing her account to the public. “In the face of this, Republicans are jamming her into a ‘take it or leave it’ kangaroo hearing without even the courtesy of proper investigation of her claims. It is a disgrace.”",www.nytimes.com,left,c7FRW4PMSpm63ToR

Former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced Tuesday she is in the early stages of what is likely Alzheimer's disease and is retiring from public life.

O'Connor, 88, released a public letter about her diagnosis.

Read the full statement below.

Friends and fellow Americans,

I want to share some personal news with you.

Some time ago, doctors diagnosed me with the beginning stages of dementia, probably Alzheimer’s disease. As this condition has progressed, I am no longer able to participate in public life. Since many people have asked about my current status and activities, I want to be open about these changes, and while I am still able, share some personal thoughts.

Not long after I retired from the Supreme Court twelve years ago, I made a commitment to myself, my family, and my country that I would use whatever years I had left to advance civic learning and engagement.

I feel so strongly about the topic because I’ve seen first-hand how vital it is for all citizens to understand our Constitution and unique system of government, and participate actively in their communities. It is through this shared understanding of who we are that we can follow the approaches that have served us best over time – working collaboratively together in communities and in government to solve problems, putting country and the common good above party and self-interest, and holding our key governmental institutions accountable.

Eight years ago, I started iCivics for just this purpose – to teach the core principles of civics to middle and high school students with free online interactive games and curriculum that make learning relevant and remarkably effective. Today, iCivics (www.icivics.org) reaches half the youth in our country. We must reach all our youth, and we need to find ways to get people – young and old – more involved in their communities and in their government. As my three sons are tired of hearing me say, “It’s not enough to understand, you’ve got to do something.” There is no more important work than deepening young people’s engagement in our nation.

I can no longer help lead this cause, due to my physical condition. It is time for new leaders to make civic learning and civic engagement a reality for all. It is my great hope that our nation will commit to educating our youth about civics, and to helping young people understand their crucial role as informed, active citizens in our nation. To achieve this, I hope that private citizens, counties, states, and the federal government will work together to create and fund a nationwide civics education initiative. Many wonderful people already are working towards this goal, but they need real help and public commitment. I look forward to watching from the sidelines as others continue the hard work ahead.

I will continue living in Phoenix, Arizona, surrounded by dear friends and family. While the final chapter of my life with dementia may be trying, nothing has diminished my gratitude and deep

appreciation for the countless blessings in my life. How fortunate I feel to be an American and to have been presented with the remarkable opportunities available to the citizens of our country. As a young cowgirl from the Arizona desert, I never could have imagined that one day I would become the first woman justice on the U.S. Supreme Court.

I hope that I have inspired young people about civic engagement and helped pave the pathway for women who may have faced obstacles pursuing their careers. My greatest thanks to our nation, to my family, to my former colleagues, and to all the wonderful people I have had the opportunity to engage with over the years.

God bless you all.

WASHINGTON — For his first Supreme Court nomination, President Trump wanted as staunch a conservative as he could get confirmed. Neil Gorsuch emerged as the guy who looks like he could thread the needle.

He's not the fiery conservative that federal appeals court Judge William Pryor has been for more than a decade on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, based in the South. But conservatives advising Trump judged that Pryor, 54, might not get through the Senate; he failed in 2003 before getting a second chance for his current post.

He's also not the lesser-known jurist that federal appeals court Judge Thomas Hardiman has been for more than a decade, first on a federal trial court before ascending to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit, based in Philadelphia. But conservatives feared that Hardiman, 51, might not turn out to be a worthy successor to the late Justice Antonin Scalia.

In Gorsuch, Trump gets someone who enthuses conservatives but possesses the stellar credentials and winning personality needed to assuage some Senate Democrats — or, at a minimum, virtually every Senate Republican.

With confirmation in mind, here are Gorsuch's pros and cons:

Pro: He's out of central casting. He has degrees from Columbia, Harvard Law and Oxford to boot, where he got a doctorate in legal philosophy.

Con: He's out of central casting. Trump originally sought to diversify the court from its Ivy League pedigree.

Pro: He's a true Westerner, born and raised in Denver, an avid skier who used to go fishing with Scalia. For a court dominated by New Yorkers and with only one Californian, he brings geographical diversity.

Con: He isn't Merrick Garland. Most Senate Democrats likely will argue that no Trump nominee deserves their support after Republicans refused to grant a hearing or a vote to Garland, President Obama's compromise choice last March to replace Scalia.

Pro: He's Scalia Light. A firm adherent of the late justice's belief that the Constitution and laws should be followed rather than liberally interpreted, Gorsuch seems like a deserving recipient of Scalia's seat.

Con: ""Scalia"" is a dirty word among liberals who excoriated the late justice for his acerbic opinions and rhetoric, even if on the losing side, on issues ranging from civil rights to same-sex marriage.

Pro: He's a gifted writer who goes out of his way to make his opinions accessible to average readers, in the tradition of Scalia and the most recent Supreme Court nominee, Justice Elena Kagan.

Con: His rhetorical flourishes, in opinions and outside speeches, could give Democrats fodder to question and attack him on issues such as abortion and assisted suicide — the latter being a topic Gorsuch tackled (and opposed) in a 2006 book.

Pro: He's been around the block. Even at 49, Gorsuch boasts considerable experience in Washington, D.C., where he worked in private practice and at the Justice Department.

Con: Washington experience is a double-edged sword. Democrats surely will associate Gorsuch with decisions made by the Bush administration while he worked there. Anti-Washington sentiment kept top-notch prospects such as federal appeals court Judge Brett Kavanaugh and former U.S. solicitor general Paul Clement off Trump's list.

Note the uproar over Brett Kavanaugh’s behavior — nice or nasty — at a high school party he attended at age 17. This, during the early years of the Reagan administration. The invitation to a good grime festival comes from Democrats, the national media, and even Republicans like Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona. Who are we to refuse? We like our dirt where we can find it. It is the attribute Democrats give every evidence of counting on to sink a Supreme Court nomination.

Sen. Democratic leader Chuck Schumer is shocked, you may have heard, to learn of “credible evidence” that Kavanaugh may have perpetrated violence upon a young woman at a party. The woman herself says he did. Which settles things? Hardly. Kavanaugh stoutly denies the allegations. And it was 37 years ago, during the Reagan presidency, and before cellphone cameras.

Major decisions are expected this month, as the U.S. Supreme Court works its way through several cases still pending before it closes out its calendar for the 2014-2015 term.

Among the biggest issues hanging fire: the status of same-sex marriages, subsidies for health insurance under Obamacare and the drugs that states may use to administer the death penalty by lethal injection. But the court is also expected to weigh in on the drawing of lines for congressional elections, the right to put the Confederate flag on license plates and the right of a municipality to regulate outdoor signage.

""Decision days"" are scheduled for each Monday this month, along with Thursday, June 18 — and there could be yet another day announced, as well. The court has not gone beyond June in more than 20 years.

It is typical for the court to issue its most important and controversial rulings in the final days of its annual session. Many expect the same-sex-marriage and Obamacare decisions to come later in the month. But many court observers are expecting the lethal injection decision sooner, along with more than a dozen cases that carry considerable significance of their own.

The court meets at 10 a.m. ET Monday and on the other decision days of the month. NPR will be covering the proceedings and reporting on the decisions as soon as they become available, on our regular radio programs, on NPR.org, NPR One and other platforms.

Lethal Injection (Glossip v. Gross)

As traditional methods such as hanging, firing squad and electrocution have fallen from favor, states with the death penalty have been injecting a ""protocol,"" or series of drugs, to execute death row prisoners. But pharmaceutical companies now refuse to provide sodium thiopental, the drug used at the beginning of the series to make the prisoner lose consciousness.

States have looked for substitutes, including midazolam, which is a sedative and not an anesthetic. Inmates who have brought this case say that those who receive this drug may remain conscious after dosage, when they receive subsequent drugs. Some members of the court were clearly sympathetic to this viewpoint in the oral argument earlier this year. But some of the court's conservatives seemed to regard it as a ""backdoor"" means to undermine the death penalty itself.

If the court sides with the inmates, states will have to scramble to find alternative means of execution, which may include a return to the more traditional methods.

Obamacare (King v. Burwell)

Plaintiffs have argued that only those states that have set up their own exchanges for the purchase of health care insurance are entitled to give subsidies to lower-income people. States that let the federal government set up their exchanges for them, they contend, may not accept the federal tax credits that subsidize those eligible in state-run exchanges. The administration argues that the intent of the legislators was clear, whatever the exact wording of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, and that all exchanges are eligible for the subsidies.

If the court rules for the plaintiffs, subsidies could go away for more than 6 million current recipients, although the timetable for their losing insurance is somewhat uncertain. Congress would be under pressure to act.

Taking this many people out of the system would also affect the private health insurance market and the amount that people pay in insurance premiums. The degree of impact would depend on how sweeping the justices' ruling is. But it could affect individuals, small business, large business, the insurance industry, doctors and hospitals.

Same-Sex Marriage (Obergefell v. Hodges and related cases)

A series of recent rulings by the high court has led to the legalization of same-sex marriage in three dozen states, which are home to more than 70 percent of the U.S. population. This has happened despite many states' efforts to enact bans on such marriages, either by legislation or by referendum.

These laws and state constitutional amendments have been consistently struck down by federal courts at the district and appellate levels — except for the Federal Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit. This one court, sitting in Cincinnati, upheld the ban enacted in that state and several others and said states did not have to recognize marriages performed legally in other states. This ""circuit split"" between appeals judges brought the case before the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year.

The court now has the opportunity to clarify the legal situation by legalizing same-sex marriage in all 50 states or to adopt any of several more complicated resolutions — leaving some states with legal same-sex marriage but others — perhaps most — without. The court is also deciding a related case regarding the right of a state to refuse to recognize a same-sex marriage that took place legally in another state.

Other cases to watch ...

Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission

Are state laws that put redistricting in the hands of independent commissions unconstitutional? Arizona voters created a commission by constitutional amendment, and some state legislators say that this strips them of their redistricting power, thus violating the U.S. Constitution.

Walker v. Texas Division, Sons Of The Confederacy

May states constitutionally ban the Sons of the Confederacy from displaying the Confederate battle flag on vanity license plates?

Reed v. Town of Gilbert, Ariz.

What should be the constitutional rules for municipalities seeking to limit sign clutter? In this case, a church posted signs that the town wanted to regulate or remove.

Michigan v. EPA

At what point does the federal Clean Air Act require the Environmental Protection Agency to take into account the costs that factory owners face in complying with EPA regulation? Should it be before or after deciding to regulate hazardous pollutants?

supreme_court,Fox Online News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/09/18/moral-and-political-dilemma-created-by-kavanaughs-accuser.html,The moral and political dilemma created by Kavanaugh's accuser,2018-09-18,Howard Kurtz,"In less than 24 hours , the Supreme Court confirmation process has been utterly transformed from a virtual certainty to a dramatic dilemma .
When Brett Kavanaugh faced only an unnamed accuser with a vague story about something that allegedly happened nearly four decades ago , when he was at Georgetown Prep , it was clear that the Republicans had no intention of slowing down the train . And a rough media consensus , including some on the left , decided that this was a late hit and an unfair one at that .
But when Christine Blasey Ford came forward to The Washington Post , she changed the equation . And when her lawyer said on two morning shows yesterday that Ford is willing to testify , it created an unstoppable momentum that forced Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley to invite her and Kavanaugh to testify next Monday . Once Jeff Flake and Susan Collins joined the call for hearings , there was no turning back . So much for Grassley 's initial suggestion that they just chat by phone .
Kavanaugh , too , with an expanded but equally vociferous denial , said he is willing to testify . So the initial proposal by Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley , that both be interviewed over the phone , looks dead in the water .
Even President Trump , whose first instinct is always to counterattack , was restrained in comments about his nominee .
While praising Kavanaugh , the president also said , `` I wish the Democrats could have done this a lot sooner , because they had this information for many months . And they should n't have waited til literally the last days . They should have done it a lot sooner . But with all of that being said we want to go through the process . ''
And he added : `` If it takes a little delay , it 'll take a little delay . ''
Earlier , Kellyanne Conway said that `` this woman should not be insulted and she should not be ignored . ''
Much of this is driven by math . With Jeff Flake , who is retiring , and Susan Collins saying there should be hearings , and the Republicans holding only a 51-49 majority , two defections could kill the nomination , even if the GOP bypasses the committee for a floor vote .
Look , the process was terrible . Dianne Feinstein had been sitting on the anonymous letter since July . Even the liberal editorial page of the San Francisco Chronicle said Feinstein was `` unfair '' to everyone—the nominee , the accuser and the panel ’ s members . The 11th-hour nature of the charge makes it look like desperation politics .
In the Post interview , Ford , now a research psychologist at Palo Alto University , expanded on her account , saying that Kavanaugh groped her as he tried to pull off her bathing suit and put his hand over her mouth when she screamed .
`` I thought he might inadvertently kill me , '' Ford told the paper . `` He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing . ''
And on `` Today , '' her lawyer Debra Katz said that Ford `` clearly considers this an attempted rape . She believes that if it were not for the severe intoxication of Brett Kavanaugh , she would 've been raped . ''
The Post examined a therapist 's notes from 2012 , which `` do not mention Kavanaugh 's name but say [ Ford ] reported that she was attacked by students 'from an elitist boys ’ school ' who went on to become 'highly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington . ' The notes say four boys were involved , a discrepancy Ford says was an error on the therapist ’ s part . ''
Orrin Hatch , meanwhile , says he spoke to Kavanaugh and the judge maintains that he was n't even at such a party , with the senator suggesting this is a case of mistaken identity .
So here is what the senators , the media and the public have to face :
An allegation of attempted rape is extremely serious . It can traumatize a woman for the rest of her life . The fear can linger for a very long time . It ca n't simply be written off as old news .
At the same time , if Kavanaugh did anything like what is alleged , he was a high school student . He has since built an outstanding career , worked well with women , coaches his daughters ' teams -- and 65 women who knew him at Georgetown Prep have vouched for his character . Should a horrible , drunken episode at the age of 17 ruin a man ’ s career decades later ?
But Kavanaugh says unequivocally this never happened . If lawmakers were to conclude otherwise , they could deem him to be lying — as an adult .
Throw in all the twists and turns as journalists dig into the matter and the testimony that will rivet the nation next week under the glare of television lights . No one , at this point , knows how this will play out .","In less than 24 hours, the Supreme Court confirmation process has been utterly transformed from a virtual certainty to a dramatic dilemma.

When Brett Kavanaugh faced only an unnamed accuser with a vague story about something that allegedly happened nearly four decades ago, when he was at Georgetown Prep, it was clear that the Republicans had no intention of slowing down the train. And a rough media consensus, including some on the left, decided that this was a late hit and an unfair one at that.

But when Christine Blasey Ford came forward to The Washington Post, she changed the equation. And when her lawyer said on two morning shows yesterday that Ford is willing to testify, it created an unstoppable momentum that forced Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley to invite her and Kavanaugh to testify next Monday. Once Jeff Flake and Susan Collins joined the call for hearings, there was no turning back. So much for Grassley's initial suggestion that they just chat by phone.

Kavanaugh, too, with an expanded but equally vociferous denial, said he is willing to testify. So the initial proposal by Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, that both be interviewed over the phone, looks dead in the water.

Even President Trump, whose first instinct is always to counterattack, was restrained in comments about his nominee.

While praising Kavanaugh, the president also said, ""I wish the Democrats could have done this a lot sooner, because they had this information for many months. And they shouldn't have waited til literally the last days. They should have done it a lot sooner. But with all of that being said we want to go through the process.""

And he added: ""If it takes a little delay, it'll take a little delay.""

Earlier, Kellyanne Conway said that ""this woman should not be insulted and she should not be ignored.""

Much of this is driven by math. With Jeff Flake, who is retiring, and Susan Collins saying there should be hearings, and the Republicans holding only a 51-49 majority, two defections could kill the nomination, even if the GOP bypasses the committee for a floor vote.

Look, the process was terrible. Dianne Feinstein had been sitting on the anonymous letter since July. Even the liberal editorial page of the San Francisco Chronicle said Feinstein was ""unfair"" to everyone—the nominee, the accuser and the panel’s members. The 11th-hour nature of the charge makes it look like desperation politics.

In the Post interview, Ford, now a research psychologist at Palo Alto University, expanded on her account, saying that Kavanaugh groped her as he tried to pull off her bathing suit and put his hand over her mouth when she screamed.

""I thought he might inadvertently kill me,"" Ford told the paper. ""He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.""

And on ""Today,"" her lawyer Debra Katz said that Ford ""clearly considers this an attempted rape. She believes that if it were not for the severe intoxication of Brett Kavanaugh, she would've been raped.""

The Post examined a therapist's notes from 2012, which ""do not mention Kavanaugh's name but say [Ford] reported that she was attacked by students 'from an elitist boys’ school' who went on to become 'highly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington.' The notes say four boys were involved, a discrepancy Ford says was an error on the therapist’s part.""

Orrin Hatch, meanwhile, says he spoke to Kavanaugh and the judge maintains that he wasn't even at such a party, with the senator suggesting this is a case of mistaken identity.

So here is what the senators, the media and the public have to face:

An allegation of attempted rape is extremely serious. It can traumatize a woman for the rest of her life. The fear can linger for a very long time. It can't simply be written off as old news.

At the same time, if Kavanaugh did anything like what is alleged, he was a high school student. He has since built an outstanding career, worked well with women, coaches his daughters' teams--and 65 women who knew him at Georgetown Prep have vouched for his character. Should a horrible, drunken episode at the age of 17 ruin a man’s career decades later?

But Kavanaugh says unequivocally this never happened. If lawmakers were to conclude otherwise, they could deem him to be lying — as an adult.

Throw in all the twists and turns as journalists dig into the matter and the testimony that will rivet the nation next week under the glare of television lights. No one, at this point, knows how this will play out.

The 87-year-old Ginsburg , a four-time cancer survivor who announced in January that she was cancer-free , said a periodic scan and a biopsy revealed lesions on her liver , but chemotherapy treatment that began in May is `` yielding positive results . '' Her most recent scan last week showed `` significant reduction '' of the lesions , the justice said in a brief statement .
`` I am tolerating chemotherapy well and am encouraged by the success of my current treatment , '' Ginsburg said . `` I will continue bi-weekly chemotherapy to keep my cancer at bay , and am able to maintain an active daily routine . Throughout , I have kept up with opinion writing and all other court work . ''
This is Ginsburg 's fifth bout with cancer , following colon cancer in 1999 , pancreatic cancer in 2009 , lung cancer in 2018 and more pancreatic cancer last year . Still , she said she would stay on the court `` as long as I can do the job full steam , '' a phrase she has used many times in the past .
For years , Ginsburg 's health has been a concern for Democrats who worry that the high court 's 5-4 conservative majority could be expanded if she were to leave the bench before the November presidential election . Even if Democrats sweep to victories , Republicans will control the Senate at least until Jan. 3 , and President Donald Trump will be in office at least until Jan. 20 .
Ginsburg said her recent hospitalizations to remove gall stones and treat an infection were unrelated to her cancer .
Ginsburg was taken to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore earlier this week after she experienced fever and chills . She was treated for a possible infection and underwent an endoscopic procedure to clean out a bile duct stent that was inserted last August .
She had been hospitalized in May following an infection caused by a benign gallbladder condition , the Supreme Court said .
An oncologist , who has not treated the jurist , suggested that the lesions on Ginsburg 's liver could be a recurrence of pancreatic cancer . `` I believe it is metastatic pancreatic cancer , '' Dr. Wasif M. Saif , of the Northwell Health Cancer Institute , told ███ , citing the type of chemotherapy Ginsburg is receiving . He added : `` It seems like her cancer is back in the liver . The good news is that she seems to be responding . ”
The doctor also praised Ginsburg 's longevity , more than a decade after she was first diagnosed with pancreatic cancer . `` She was diagnosed with this cancer in 2009 . And now today , it is 2020 . This gives us hope with patients that some people can do better . It also speaks to her willpower , '' Saif said .
And Saif opined that Ginsburg should be able to continue to work . He said patients receiving chemotherapy every two weeks , rather than every week , tend to handle side effects more easily . `` I think she is one of those people who are super human . I think definitely , her commitment to what she is doing and her willpower is so strong that I will not be surprised if she continues to work during this time . ”
Ginsburg , the second-longest-serving justice on the bench , was nominated by President Bill Clinton in 1993 . She is the leader of the court 's liberal wing , which includes Associate Justices Stephen Breyer , Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan .

Marshall ultimately lived four days into the administration of Democratic President Bill Clinton . But by then his seat was held by Thomas , now the court 's longest-serving and most conservative justice .

In May , she participated in oral arguments by telephone from the hospital .
Before her fourth cancer was diagnosed , Ginsburg had said she hoped to stay on the bench for at least five more years , noting that the late Associate Justice John Paul Stevens served until age 90 . Stevens died a year ago at 99 .

University of Texas case could be handed down as soon as this Tuesday , May 28 . The court – and the public – have heard a host of arguments both for and against the practice . One opposing argument in particular has been more specious than many of the others .
For nearly a decade , UCLA Law professor Richard Sander has demanded an overhaul of affirmative action practices at colleges and universities , citing his own research on the “ mismatch ” theory . According to Mr. Sander ’ s theory , affirmative action harms blacks and Latinos because it pushes them into situations ( elite universities ) where their peers outmatch them in standardized test scores . This “ mismatch , ” Sander claims , leads to underperformance , which then leads to the students ’ failure to achieve their ultimate goals .
Scholars have been quick to point out holes in the mismatch argument . For example , scholars have highlighted how Sander ’ s research fails to capture the complexities of admissions decisionmaking , which is not simply based on test scores , but instead involves holistic reviews of the many well-qualified students who are vying for limited seats at competitive institutions .
Scholars also have noted how Sander ’ s analysis does not adequately take into account the impact of hostile racial environments ( at elite institutions ) on student performance . They have further noted how the mismatch theory improperly rests on one narrow view of merit , failing to acknowledge the many ways in which different students may be mismatched against one another . Other research shows that students who enter elite institutions under affirmative action policies excel – even more than their white peers .
Indeed , as anyone who has attended college will tell you , there are a plethora of factors that determine a student ’ s success or struggle in college . And my own experiences as a parent have taught me that , when children are “ outmatched , ” they often grow the most both in confidence and ability .
Recently , my 10-year-old daughter reminded me of this very point when she engaged in actions that demonstrated exactly why Sander ’ s mismatch theory fails in many instances . Unlike most girls , my daughter has maintained an interest in math , robotics , and numerous other things that her physics professor father is geekily proud of and , more important , that boys seem to dominate even at the tender age of 10 .
This year , my daughter joined the chess club . Having never played chess before and having parents who were not chess players , she was initially “ outmatched ” by her peers , most of whom had been playing for years . However , over time and with training and the constant challenge of being “ outmatched , ” she has become one of the stronger players in her group .
Like thousands of college students who have benefited from affirmative action programs over the past three decades , my daughter possessed the native intelligence and skill for the program she was joining . Having the additional challenge of being outmatched brought out the best in her and pushed her to excel . As my former colleague Alan Brownstein from the University of California , Davis School of Law once said to me , “ Mismatch is what we want for our kids . ”
Indeed , those of us who are parents tell our children to seek mismatches all the time . When our children want to improve their basketball skills , we do not tell them , “ Play basketball with kids who play just at your level or lower. ” Instead , we say , “ Find the best players because playing with them will improve your skills . It will make you better , stronger , wiser . ”
Of course , as parents , we know that there are limits to what our children can achieve . Some kids may not be able to make the varsity team or the honor society . Still , they also can not know their own limits until they confront challenges that test their capabilities and their determination . If they have the fortitude and the raw talent to take on these challenges , we should not slam the door in their faces and tell them that we are so sure they will fail that we refuse to even give them the opportunity to prove us wrong .
In their book “ The Shape of the River : Long-Term Consequences of Considering Race in College and University Admissions , ” William Bowen and Derek Bok , former presidents of Princeton University and Harvard University , respectively , confirmed that our parental instinct to encourage mismatches is on the mark . The book ’ s data revealed that racial minority students who benefited from affirmative action at elite schools graduated at higher rates than those at less selective institutions . And they earned advanced degrees at rates similar to their white peers .
The data that Mr. Bowen and Mr. Bok highlight also show that such students contributed to civic and community activities after college more than their white counterparts and made significant achievements in business and government upon graduation .
These findings are further affirmed by the work featured in the book “ Crossing the Finish Line : Completing College at America 's Public Universities ” by Bowen ; Matthew Chingos , a Brookings Institution fellow ; and Michael S. McPherson , a former president of Macalester College .
“ Crossing the Finish Line ” revealed that students who are “ undermatched ” – meaning students who attended a college that was less selective than their credentials would have allowed them to attend ( and thus should have been easier for them ) – graduated at a lower rate than those students who “ matched ” – meaning students who attended a college that was as selective as their credentials would have allowed them to attend .
As this research shows , success in college , and later in life , is about more than just numbers ; it is about resources , support of intellectual development , environment , networks , and numerous other factors .
In fact , as many of our parenting experiences have taught us , mismatches are not just good for the “ outmatched , ” but also for the “ overmatched ” – meaning those students at elite institutions with ample qualifications and privileged backgrounds . Much like Justice Sandra Day O ’ Connor highlighted in Grutter v. the University of Michigan Law School , the “ overmatched ” benefit just as greatly from their diverse surroundings in elite institutions as the “ outmatched . ”

“ Trump is the most financially conflicted president of the modern era , and his tenure has shown the inadequacy of voluntary disclosure . He hasn ’ t released his tax returns , and the trust controlling his business interests , overseen by his two eldest sons and his longtime accountant , is anything but blind . Litigants typically don ’ t withhold information that speaks well of themselves so it ’ s natural to wonder about what it is in Trump ’ s financial records that he has been so determined to hide…
“ In the meantime , the Supreme Court has removed Team Trump ’ s ability to argue that the president resides atop Olympus , untouched by the rules that govern the rest of us . ”
“ When Congress subpoenas the President , the Court found , issues relating to the separation of powers come into play in a way that they don ’ t when a President is asked to give evidence in a criminal proceeding . The middle way the Court offered was a four-step test : Did the legislative purpose really warrant a subpoena ? Was the demand for documents broader than it had to be ?

The left is generally supportive of the decisions but dismayed that Trump may be able to delay releasing documents until after the election.

“Trump is the most financially conflicted president of the modern era, and his tenure has shown the inadequacy of voluntary disclosure. He hasn’t released his tax returns, and the trust controlling his business interests, overseen by his two eldest sons and his longtime accountant, is anything but blind. Litigants typically don’t withhold information that speaks well of themselves so it’s natural to wonder about what it is in Trump’s financial records that he has been so determined to hide…



“In the meantime, the Supreme Court has removed Team Trump’s ability to argue that the president resides atop Olympus, untouched by the rules that govern the rest of us.”

Timothy L. O’Brien, Bloomberg

“When Congress subpoenas the President, the Court found, issues relating to the separation of powers come into play in a way that they don’t when a President is asked to give evidence in a criminal proceeding. The middle way the Court offered was a four-step test: Did the legislative purpose really warrant a subpoena? Was the demand for documents broader than it had to be? Did courts think that there was good evidence establishing that the purpose Congress claimed was, indeed, its purpose? And how much of a burden did it place on the President?…



“This obviously makes for a longer path toward revealing Trump’s financial entanglements than if the Court had simply ordered the President to open his files today. But… The rulings were a reminder that this country still has laws.”

USA TODAY

The Supreme Court late Monday blocked the first of at least six executions planned in Arkansas over the next two weeks after a dizzying day of state and federal court disputes about lethal injection drugs, mental health claims and the right to legal representation.

The justices’ action represented a setback, but not a final blow, for Arkansas officials as they race the clock to execute convicted murderers before the state’s supply of a controversial sedative used for executions passes its expiration date. If that happens, all the executions will be put on hold.

Justices turned down Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge’s request to vacate a stay for Don Davis, 54, who was set to die Monday night by lethal injection. It’s the second time in seven years that Davis, who was convicted in a 1992 murder, has come within hours of execution before courts intervened.

Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson released a statement saying he was disappointed in the delay. ""While this has been an exhausting day for all involved, tomorrow we will continue to fight back on last minute appeals and efforts to block justice for the victims’ families,” the statement read.

Pause on Arkansas executions highlights national trend

The order does not affect executions still planned for Thursday and next week, among eight originally scheduled with unprecedented haste over an 11-day period because of the looming deadline. A federal district court had blocked all the executions Saturday, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit reversed that decision. Other courts blocked two of the executions over separate issues of competency and clemency.

While the last-minute appeals raised technical issues involving the defendants’ legal rights and courts’ jurisdiction, the state’s effort to execute its first prisoners since 2005 focused largely on the drugs to be used. One of them, the sedative midazolam, has been associated with botched executions in Alabama, Arizona, Ohio and Oklahoma. Another, vecuronium bromide, was said by its manufacturer to have been obtained by the state under false pretenses.

The planned executions have renewed the debate over lethal injection in particular and capital punishment in general, which has been in decline for nearly two decades. No state has executed so many prisoners in such a short time span. Twice in 1997, Texas executed eight prisoners in a single month, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.

The Supreme Court refused to hear the prisoners’ appeal in February, along with another case from Alabama. At the time, Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen Breyer dissented. Sotomayor has been the court's leading critic of midazolam; Breyer has questioned the constitutionality of capital punishment.

The high court has tossed out two Texas death sentences this year — one because of racially discriminatory testimony, the other because of an outdated definition of intellectual disability. It is scheduled to hear two more death penalty cases on April 24, the date two more Arkansas prisoners are slated for execution.

supreme_court,National Review,2,https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/07/conservative-supreme-court-reform-more-important-than-ever/,Is the Conservative Movement for Supreme Court Reform Dead?,2018-07-07,"J. J. Mccullough, John Mccormack, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Mairead Mcardle, Robert Verbruggen, Carrie Severino, Tobias Hoonhout, Rich Lowry, John Fund","As more and more of our political debates are settled by the judiciary , it has become uncontroversial to describe the Supreme Court as a political institution . We understand the ideologies of Supreme Court judges to be broadly continuous with the ideologies of the elected politicians who appoint and confirm them , and thus the rulings they generate . The consensus of the political class regarding Supreme Court appointments is that presidents should seek politically simpatico justices .
Justice Clarence Thomas was the last high-court nominee confirmed by a Senate of a different party from the president who nominated him . Liberal justices Ginsberg , Breyer , Sotomayor , and Kagan were appointed by Democratic presidents and ratified by a Democratic Senate ; conservatives Roberts , Alito , and Gorsuch were appointed and approved by Republicans .
From one perspective this looks petty and partisan . Yet such ideological sorting also concedes the court ’ s unglamorous modern reality . If judges are to be summoned to address matters that in an earlier era would have been managed by elected politicians — health-care policy , abortion , etc . — then it is democratically defensible for those judges to represent clearly and accurately the divide of American thought .
Justice Anthony Kennedy helped delay an inevitable conclusion , in which one side of America ’ s ideological divide would eventually secure clear control of the Supreme Court . During his 2006–2018 peak of influence , four conservative justices faced down four liberal ones , and Kennedy ’ s esoteric personal philosophy broke the ties in various , often seemingly random directions . But with Kennedy now gone , and a Republican president and Senate eager to confirm his successor , we are set to enter a new age in which the Supreme Court will likely be understood as more overtly political than ever . Having secured America ’ s most-sought political prize , Republicans will shift their priorities defensively and opportunistically , as victorious political factions always do .
One likely casualty will be the death of the conservative movement for Supreme Court reform . During the Kennedy era , and the even more unsatisfying age before that , conservatives railed in countless books , columns , and speeches against the Supreme Court ’ s power , partially on the basis of politics , but not entirely so . The Court , they argued , was too powerful , being the only major constitutional institution whose decisions were not subject to the equivalent of a veto or veto override . As human lifespans increased , they said , the lifetime terms for Supreme Court justices were similarly metamorphosing into something grotesque and monarchical . Cloistered justices enjoyed terms that meandered across decades . A president who left office a generation ago , or even died , could still be exerting ideological influence on the country , fulfilling Thomas Paine ’ s famous warning about “ the vanity and presumption of governing beyond the grave , ” which he called “ the most ridiculous and insolent of all tyrannies . ”
Supreme Court reform is a good idea whose time never seems right , because the court ’ s powers have made the stakes so impossibly high .
Now poised to enjoy a 5–4 majority of the justices , conservatives will , one imagines , quickly abandon their irritation with the Court . But the accuracy of the Right ’ s institutional critiques will not cease to be valid simply because the Court ’ s outcomes will now be more politically agreeable . The debate over how to best hold accountable a Supreme Court that can not help but act as a political institution remains valid , even when — perhaps especially when — conservatives are less interested in it .
There ’ s certainly little reason to believe a newly desperate Left will fill the reformist void competently . Already , there appears to be a conscious progressive effort afoot to mainstream the idea that the next Democratic president and Senate should engage in FDR-style court packing , expanding the SCOTUS bench with additional judges via ordinary legislation . Their political calculation holds blunt control of the Court to be the only thing that matters ; they are mostly disinterested in any deeper critique of its authority in our constitutional system .
Supreme Court reform is a good idea whose time never seems right , because the court ’ s powers have made the stakes so impossibly high . When you ’ re in government , as Republicans are now , the temptation is to not look a gift horse in the mouth .

It shouldn’t be.

As more and more of our political debates are settled by the judiciary, it has become uncontroversial to describe the Supreme Court as a political institution. We understand the ideologies of Supreme Court judges to be broadly continuous with the ideologies of the elected politicians who appoint and confirm them, and thus the rulings they generate. The consensus of the political class regarding Supreme Court appointments is that presidents should seek politically simpatico justices.

Justice Clarence Thomas was the last high-court nominee confirmed by a Senate of a different party from the president who nominated him. Liberal justices Ginsberg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan were appointed by Democratic presidents and ratified by a Democratic Senate; conservatives Roberts, Alito, and Gorsuch were appointed and approved by Republicans.

From one perspective this looks petty and partisan. Yet such ideological sorting also concedes the court’s unglamorous modern reality. If judges are to be summoned to address matters that in an earlier era would have been managed by elected politicians — health-care policy, abortion, etc. — then it is democratically defensible for those judges to represent clearly and accurately the divide of American thought.

Justice Anthony Kennedy helped delay an inevitable conclusion, in which one side of America’s ideological divide would eventually secure clear control of the Supreme Court. During his 2006–2018 peak of influence, four conservative justices faced down four liberal ones, and Kennedy’s esoteric personal philosophy broke the ties in various, often seemingly random directions. But with Kennedy now gone, and a Republican president and Senate eager to confirm his successor, we are set to enter a new age in which the Supreme Court will likely be understood as more overtly political than ever. Having secured America’s most-sought political prize, Republicans will shift their priorities defensively and opportunistically, as victorious political factions always do.

One likely casualty will be the death of the conservative movement for Supreme Court reform. During the Kennedy era, and the even more unsatisfying age before that, conservatives railed in countless books, columns, and speeches against the Supreme Court’s power, partially on the basis of politics, but not entirely so. The Court, they argued, was too powerful, being the only major constitutional institution whose decisions were not subject to the equivalent of a veto or veto override. As human lifespans increased, they said, the lifetime terms for Supreme Court justices were similarly metamorphosing into something grotesque and monarchical. Cloistered justices enjoyed terms that meandered across decades. A president who left office a generation ago, or even died, could still be exerting ideological influence on the country, fulfilling Thomas Paine’s famous warning about “the vanity and presumption of governing beyond the grave,” which he called “the most ridiculous and insolent of all tyrannies.”

Supreme Court reform is a good idea whose time never seems right, because the court’s powers have made the stakes so impossibly high.

Now poised to enjoy a 5–4 majority of the justices, conservatives will, one imagines, quickly abandon their irritation with the Court. But the accuracy of the Right’s institutional critiques will not cease to be valid simply because the Court’s outcomes will now be more politically agreeable. The debate over how to best hold accountable a Supreme Court that cannot help but act as a political institution remains valid, even when — perhaps especially when — conservatives are less interested in it.

There’s certainly little reason to believe a newly desperate Left will fill the reformist void competently. Already, there appears to be a conscious progressive effort afoot to mainstream the idea that the next Democratic president and Senate should engage in FDR-style court packing, expanding the SCOTUS bench with additional judges via ordinary legislation. Their political calculation holds blunt control of the Court to be the only thing that matters; they are mostly disinterested in any deeper critique of its authority in our constitutional system.

Supreme Court reform is a good idea whose time never seems right, because the court’s powers have made the stakes so impossibly high. When you’re in government, as Republicans are now, the temptation is to not look a gift horse in the mouth. When you’re in opposition, as Democrats are now, calling a time out to question the rules of the game looks weak and cynical. Conservatives do have an advantage, though, in that their pedigree on this issue is more established, which makes an era like this the best test of their seriousness.

Like Rand Paul and Marco Rubio, I’m personally a fan of term and/or age limits for Supreme Court justices, which already exist at the state level everywhere except Rhode Island. Implementing some sort of mechanism through which the Constitution’s insistence that justices “shall hold their offices during good behavior” can be enforced would probably be advisable as well, in order to give this most-unchecked branch some degree of ongoing oversight, beyond the extraordinarily high bar of judicial impeachment.

A more rightward Supreme Court will yield many good things, yet political enthusiasm for outcomes should not supersede all other concerns.

You have opponents whose first and only objective is delay . From the start of the confirmation proceedings on Judge Brett Kavanaugh ’ s nomination to the Supreme Court , those opponents , Senate Democrats , have thus pushed for delay . At every turn . Of course they never come out and say that ’ s what they ’ re doing — they never come out and say , “ We ’ ve abused the confirmation process and dropped a bomb at the eleventh hour , an uncorroborated , 36-year-old allegation of sexual assault , because we ’ re trying to delay the vote until after the midterms. ” But delay is what they want .
It doesn ’ t matter what sheep ’ s clothing the wolf comes in ; the wolf is always delay . When they say , “ We ’ re protecting survivors , ” they mean , “ We want delay. ” When they posture that “ women must be believed , ” their aim is more delay . When they say , “ The FBI must investigate to remove any cloud over the nominee , ” the translation is : “ Give us a delay so we can come up with new reasons for delay . ”
So , finally , we get to a committee vote over two weeks after it should have happened ; after reopening a hearing that involved 31 hours of testimony from the nominee ; after 65 meetings with senators and followed by over 1,200 answers to post-hearing questions , more than the combined number of post-hearing questions in the history of Supreme Court nominations . We finally get Kavanaugh ’ s nomination voted out of committee . And then , as a final floor vote is about to be scheduled and debated , Republicans — taking their lead from the ineffable Jeff Flake — agree to accede to one more Democratic request ( really , just one more , cross-our-hearts . . . ) . And what would that be ?
The rationale for this delay is priceless : We need an FBI investigation . It is understandable that the public does not realize how specious this demand is . But who would have thought Senate Republicans were in need of a civics lesson ?
The Constitution assigns the advice-and-consent function to the legislative branch . The FBI is a component of the executive branch . The constitutional powers of the legislature are not contingent on the cooperation of the executive . Moreover , the FBI did not exist until it was created by statute at the start of the 20th century , meaning the Senate was quite capably vetting judicial nominations for over a century before there was an FBI .
The Senate Judiciary Committee , which is charged with assessing judicial nominees , has one of the largest professional staffs of any committee on Capitol Hill . The staff includes many former federal prosecutors and investigators . The committee never needs to wait for the FBI ; it can conduct its own , very thorough investigation of any judicial nominee .
In connection with appointments to the judiciary and executive-branch offices , the FBI assists the Senate by conducting background investigations of nominees . These investigations are not like criminal investigations , in which the FBI attempts to build a prosecution by developing proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the essential elements of federal penal offenses . The investigations are not like counterintelligence investigations , in which the FBI gathers intelligence about threats to American interests posed by foreign powers . In a background investigation , the FBI simply checks its indicies ( such as its databank of rap sheets ) and conducts interviews with colleagues , associates , neighbors , and other acquaintances of the nominee . The point is not to conduct criminal investigations of any allegations that develop — particularly not of state-law violations that may be time-barred for prosecution and that the FBI does not have jurisdiction to investigate anyway . The point is to flag issues for the Senate so that it may make a discriminating appraisal of the nominee ’ s professional competence and character .
In conducting a background check , the FBI does not draw a conclusion about a nominee ’ s suitability . If alleged misconduct is not the subject of a conviction or acquittal , the FBI does not make an assessment of guilt or innocence . To do these things would be to usurp the constitutional role of the Senate — it is the Senate , not the FBI , that decides whether a nominee is fit for the responsibilities of the office to which he is nominated .
Moreover , the Senate typically does not abdicate its responsibilities or judgment to executive agencies . If , for example , the FBI were to decide tomorrow that some state police agency had not committed a civil-rights violation for which it was being investigated following some racially charged incident , Democratic senators would revert to their default position of announcing that they would conduct their own investigation because the FBI is highly fallible . On most issues , Dianne Feinstein and Judiciary Committee Democrats do not suggest that the exercise of the Senate ’ s constitutional prerogatives must be suspended until Christopher Wray descends from Mount Sinai with the relevant tablets .
An FBI investigation of unsubstantiated allegations against Judge Kavanaugh would not resolve those allegations . If the FBI tried to resolve them but came out in Kavanaugh ’ s favor , Democrats would say the investigation was flawed — politicized by the Trump administration . But , in fact , the FBI would not try to resolve them ; the bureau would simply interview some pertinent witnesses — if they agreed to speak to the FBI , which they would not be required to do . It would then pass the interview summaries along to the Judiciary Committee so that it could decide what probative value , if any , they had on the matter of Kavanaugh ’ s suitability . In other words , the FBI would only do exactly what the committee could do by itself — talk to people who might have germane information . There is nothing magical , dispositive , or conclusive about an FBI background investigation .
Judiciary Committee Democrats do not want an FBI investigation of allegations against Judge Kavanaugh because they think it will be especially illuminating or reliable . They want it because it will result in delay , giving them the breathing room necessary to come up with more reasons for delay .
So , naturally , Republicans are giving them their FBI investigation , and more delay .
Observing that the GOP majority is giving Democrats exactly what they want does not adequately convey how incompetently Republicans have performed . In announcing that the floor vote on Kavanaugh ’ s nomination will be delayed , the Senate Judiciary Committee , under Republican control , issued a press release Friday afternoon , which states ( my italics ) : “ The supplemental FBI background investigation would be limited to current credible allegations against the nominee. ” But there are no credible allegations against Kavanaugh ; there are incredible allegations that stand uncorroborated and convincingly denied .
Unbelievably , Republicans put this statement out right before President Trump agreed to the ( purported ) one-week delay for the investigation . Thus , the media can now accurately report that the president was convinced to direct an additional FBI probe after Senate Republicans expressly conceded that the sexual-assault allegations against Judge Kavanaugh are credible .
And why are they “ credible ” ? Because Christine Blasey Ford , Kavanaugh ’ s principal accuser , was widely deemed credible in her testimony at Thursday ’ s hearing — even though her story has no support from independent evidence , is rejected by the witnesses she named , and is incoherent because she can not recall and relate rudimentary details .
How did such an account get labeled “ credible ” ? Well , to question Dr. Ford at the hearing , Judiciary Committee Republicans retained Arizona prosecutor Rachel Mitchell . In principle , this was not a bad plan , but somebody forgot to tell Ms. Mitchell that this was a high-stakes hearing in need of searching cross-examination , not the rambling , information-gathering questioning typical of a deposition .
Maybe Republicans instructed Mitchell to refrain from asking Ford hard questions ; or maybe , her experience notwithstanding , Mitchell took it on herself to conduct a gentle , confrontation-free examination . Either way , in the one and only chance they will ever have to question Ford , Republicans failed to highlight the deep flaws in her account .
Mitchell invited Ford to wax scientific about how “ the etiology of PTSD is multi-factorial , ” and to school Mitchell on the topography of Montgomery County . But if you were listening for basic questions about the alleged sexual assault , you listened in vain . This isn ’ t hard . A lawyer could have been completely respectful of Dr. Ford ’ s emotional distress and still have asked elementary questions :
Isn ’ t it a fact that you don ’ t know where or when this purported assault happened ?
Isn ’ t it a fact that you can ’ t tell us how you got there ?
You just know the house was several miles from your home , but it is a fact , is it not , that you can ’ t tell us how you got home ?
You ’ ve told us that you were terrified running out of the house after the attack , but you can ’ t tell us who rescued you and drove you away ?
You remember 36 years ago that you had exactly one beer at the party , you remember hearing your alleged attackers go downstairs , you remember exactly the route you took to get out of the house , yet you can ’ t tell us what happened after you left the house ?
So , you ’ re sure the party happened , but you can ’ t say when it happened , you can ’ t say where it happened , you don ’ t know how you got there , you don ’ t know how you got home , and every person you ’ ve identified as a witness says that they have no memory of the party and that they never saw Brett Kavanaugh act the way you ’ ve described , isn ’ t that right ?
It would not have taken very long . Certainly Democrats demonstrated to Ms. Mitchell that five-minute rounds can be used very effectively if you have a plan . But the only plan Republicans seem to have had was not to offend anyone by asking questions that were , you know , about the subject matter of the hearing that the whole country was watching . A witness can seem awfully credible if she ’ s not asked about the incredible aspects of her story .
And — voila ! — the Democrats have their next delay and can proclaim that Senate Republicans found the allegations so credible that President Trump had to call in the FBI to investigate .","Senate Judiciary Committee members (from left) Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), Jeff Flake (R., Ariz.) and Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), September 28, 2018.

Some took an optimistic approach , saying approval of the exemptions will prevent few visitors from entering the U.S. under either the travel ban or the refugee pause . Others were outraged that the court gave an imprimatur to any of the president ’ s policy .
The Homeland Security Department said it will soon issue guidance about how it will carry out the court ’ s directives .
Advocacy groups said they will be watching closely and will be prepared to file lawsuits if they think the government is refusing entry to deserving visitors , refugees and immigrants .

The court has set oral arguments on the full case for October , when the next term begins .
But all the justices Monday signaled a reluctance to follow the lead of several lower courts , which said Mr. Trump ’ s campaign rhetoric regarding Muslims poisoned his executive orders .
During the presidential campaign , Mr. Trump proposed a full ban on admitting any Muslims to the U.S . In January , after taking office , he issued an executive order that imposed a 120-day pause on all new refugees , dropped the annual ceiling of refugees to 50,000 — down from the 110,000 that President Obama had set , and called for a 90-day halt in admissions from Iran , Iraq , Libya , Somalia , Sudan , Syria and Yemen .
Those seven countries — all predominantly Muslim — had been first identified by Congress and Mr. Obama as so terror-prone and dangerous that their citizens needed extra vetting .
After courts ruled against the January executive order , Mr. Trump issued a revised order in March removing Iraq from the targeted countries and allowing waivers that granted admission to people who the government deemed already had connections to the U.S. , such as an approved visa or family living in the country .
Some legal analysts said the Supreme Court ruling did little more than codify that latest policy .
“ An American individual or entity that has a bona fide relationship with a particular person seeking to enter the country as a refugee can legitimately claim concrete hardship if that person is excluded , ” the justices said in the unsigned opinion . “ But when it comes to refugees who lack any such connection to the United States , for the reasons we have set out , the balance tips in favor of the Government ’ s compelling need to provide for the Nation ’ s security . ”
Three members of the court — Justices Clarence Thomas , Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch — issued their own opinion saying they would have gone further and upheld the president ’ s entire policy .
“ I fear that the Court ’ s remedy will prove unworkable , ” said Justice Thomas , writing for the dissenters . He said the decision creates a nightmare for the administration , which must come up with definitions of what constitutes “ sufficient connection . ”
The court also created an exemption to Mr. Trump ’ s 50,000-refugee cap , saying that anyone already in the pipeline with close connections to the U.S. must be admitted — a striking move that garnered little explanation in the 13-page ruling .
Some advocacy groups argued that meant no refugees will be blocked because of the ban , because everyone in the pipeline already has ties to the U.S. by dint of the fact that a resettlement agency in the U.S. is working on their case .
Other groups feared that some refugees will be left on the outside and stranded in dangerous conditions .
Those future fights aside , the ruling is the first major legal victory for Mr. Trump , who had been blasted by lower courts — chiefly Democratic-appointed judges — for showing “ animus ” to Muslims and for failing to justify his national security concerns .
The justices , though , said the president deserves deference when acting on national security concerns in immigration matters , where Congress has given the executive branch significant leeway .
“ The Supreme Court did what the lower court judges would not : treat President Trump like any other president with the ‘ presumption of regularity , ’ ” Josh Blackman , associate professor at South Texas College of Law in Houston , wrote on his blog . “ The justices did not delve into the president ’ s Twitter account , nor did they parse his campaign statements . ”
The justices did , however , signal that they expect Mr. Trump to use the reprieve to quickly figure out and put into place new vetting policies — which was the point of the temporary pauses in the first place , according to the administration .
“ Given the Government ’ s representations in this litigation concerning the resources required to complete the 20-day review , we fully expect that the relief we grant today will permit the Executive to conclude its internal work and provide adequate notice to foreign governments ” within the time frame laid out by Mr. Trump , the justices said .
That could make much of the case moot by October , when the next session of the court begins .","The Supreme Court revived President Trump’s extreme vetting travel ban Monday, ruling that much of it can go into effect — and along the way delivering an implicit rebuke to the army of lower-court judges who blasted the president as anti-Muslim.

supreme_court,Daily Beast,0,http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/03/04/likely-supreme-court-nominee-judge-jane-kelly-is-a-true-moderate.html,Likely Supreme Court Nominee Judge Jane Kelly Is a True Moderate,2016-03-04,Jay Michaelson,"Judge Jane Kelly , now being vetted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as a potential Supreme Court nominee , has emerged as a leading contender to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia .
Kelly may have the best chance of any nominee : she was confirmed to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2013 by a 96-0 vote ; she is from Iowa , home state of Republican Charles Grassley , chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Chair ; and Grassley himself has praised her effusively in the past . All that may make it harder for Grassley to honor his pledge not to hold hearings on a potential Supreme Court Justice , in defiance of custom and constitutional law .
There ’ s not much to go on . Prior to becoming a judge , Jane Kelly served as a public defender for 17 years , which afforded few opportunities for making public statements on the finer points of jurisprudence .
But she has been an appellate court judge for the past three years , and during that time has written 82 opinions for the court . Over the past week , I have read and reviewed all of them . And what emerges is , as her reputation suggests , a moderate , thoughtful jurist without ideological biases , though with a slight tilt to the conservative side of some issues .
Now , a word of caution : These opinions only give hints . In 80 of the 82 cases , Judge Kelly was writing for a unanimous three-judge panel , not simply for herself . Often , such opinions represent a consensus view more than an individual one : The rhetoric and scope of opinions are often adjusted to gain the assent of colleagues .
Moreover , about half of the 82 cases are garden variety criminal appeals , contract disputes , insurance claims , and the other mundane cases that make up the bulk of an appellate court ’ s workload . ( There ’ s a rent dispute involving Smuckers , a former salesman suing Farmers Insurance . ) Most of this has nothing to do with the contentious issues to which Supreme Court watchers pay attention—indeed , that ’ s even true of the Supreme Court itself .
First , the overwhelming majority of criminal appeals that Judge Kelly wrote the opinions for were rejected . This does not necessarily mean Judge Kelly is “ tough on crime. ” The national reversal rate for criminal appeals is only 7 percent , which makes sense , given the heightened standards of review at the appellate level . It does suggest that Judge Kelly is not disproportionately disposed toward criminal defendants as a result of having been a career public defender .
Still , there were some close cases that did suggest a “ tough on crime ” perspective . For example , in U.S. v. Axsom , the Eighth Circuit affirmed a 15-year-jail sentence for a child pornography conviction stemming solely from 15 images traded on Limewire ( a peer-to-peer technology where batches of files may be shared without an individual ’ s knowledge of what ’ s inside ) .
In another child porn case , the court affirmed conviction even though the state showed five minutes ’ worth of images to the jury , an act which had no evidentiary value but likely disgusted and prejudiced the jurors . It ’ s easy to imagine these two cases going the other way under a more liberal judge .
When it comes to police conduct , Judge Kelly again appears to be a centrist . Most of her Fourth Amendment opinions ( US v. Meidel , Fagnan v. Lino Lakes , Greenman v. Jessen , US v. Guevara , Yang v. Roy , US v. Thompson ) find for the police and against defendants complaining of unconstitutional search or seizure . Again , that is usually the case .
In Peterson v. Kopp , Judge Kelly wrote an opinion granting immunity to an arresting officer for most of his actions , but not for pepper-spraying a defendant who asked to see his badge . That , Judge Kelly wrote , was a First Amendment violation . And in Ziesmer v. Hagen , the appeals court overturned a lower court opinion and allowed a police officer to be sued for injuring someone pulled over at a roadside stop , in an arrest that led to no criminal charges . In these cases , one might imagine a more conservative judge siding with police .
When it comes to hot-button issues that would come up in nomination hearings , Judge Kelly ’ s record is also right up the middle .
In Jackson v. Nixon , Judge Kelly wrote a 2-1 opinion upholding an atheist prisoner ’ s claim that being effectively forced to participate in an Alcoholics Anonymous-like substance abuse program violated his First Amendment rights to be free from religious coercion . ( A similar appeal from a Native American objecting to a 12-step program was rejected , but mostly on procedural grounds . )
This could be read in several ways . Though the petitioner is an atheist , this is actually a conservative-style , pro-religious-liberty holding , not unlike the recent Supreme Court case of Holt v. Hobbs , which required an Arkansas prison to let a Muslim prisoner grow a half-inch-long beard . In terms of the current debates over religious liberty and civil rights laws , Jackson is on the side of individual religious liberty ( here , to be free of religious coercion ) over a particular public policy ( in this case , the rehab program ) .
On the other hand , affirming an atheist ’ s First Amendment rights to be free from the relatively anodyne spirituality of 12-step programs could also be read as extremely liberal . Is the program ’ s suggestion to substitute “ Good Orderly Direction ” for the word “ God ” really religious coercion ? Whether Jackson is a conservative or liberal opinion depends on how you look at it .
On another hot-button issue , immigration , Judge Kelly wrote eight opinions on deportation appeals , affirming seven of them . While , again , standards of review favor upholding the decisions of immigration officials , no one could argue that Judge Kelly is soft on illegal immigration . She affirmed the deportation of a former child slave from Mexico , a Chinese woman fearing reprisal for having three children , and a victim of gang violence ( PDF ) .
Of the eight deportation appeals , the only one Judge Kelly wrote to remand was from an individual who had the help of a fraudulent assistant ( PDF ) . Here , Judge Kelly wrote , the entire application should not have been dismissed simply because the preparer was a liar .
Finally , Judge Kelly wrote a contentious 2-1 opinion in the case of US v. Fast Horse ( the Eighth Circuit has jurisdiction over several Native American lands ) . In that case , Judge Kelly reversed a conviction for sexual assault , because the defendant may not have known that his victim couldn ’ t consent . Judge Steven Colloton filed an angry dissent .
Even here , however , the tea leaves can be read in opposing ways . On the one hand , this is an opinion that makes it harder for women to prevail against sexual predators , which might anger some liberals . On the other hand , it sides with a criminal defendant over the state , which might anger some conservatives .
Perhaps most notably , Fast Horse relied on a particular ( and controversial ) Eighth Circuit precedent regarding the intent necessary to prove a rape claim : that the defendant must know the victim did not , or could not , consent . ( The dissent attacked this court for “ vacat [ ing ] yet another conviction of a sexual aggressor who engaged in sexual intercourse with a woman who was passed out or asleep. ” ) This is interesting because judicial nominees often use pat phrases like “ I would follow Supreme Court precedent ” to avoid answering questions about abortion . Here , however , is an appellate judge actually doing it : applying a precedent which some might find dubious , because it is the controlling law in the case .
Now , that could apply to Roe v. Wade but also to Citizens United . Which , finally , is the point . Over the course of 82 opinions , Judge Kelly emerges as a thoughtful centrist who would disappoint ideologues on the left and the right . There is no consistent bias in her opinions , and the fact that they may be read in multiple ways attests ( for better or for worse ) to their centrism .
Contrary to Ted Cruz ’ s outrageous statement at last night ’ s GOP debate that anyone Harry Reid supports must be a constitutional liberal , Judge Kelly ’ s record , to the extent it can be interpreted , suggests judicial moderation . It may not matter in today ’ s Senate , but if President Obama is looking for a consensus candidate , it ’ s hard to imagine a better one . Jane Kelly ’ s opinions are boring in all the right ways .","Judge Jane Kelly, now being vetted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as a potential Supreme Court nominee, has emerged as a leading contender to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia.

All that may make it harder for Grassley to honor his pledge not to hold hearings on a potential Supreme Court Justice, in defiance of custom and constitutional law.

But what does Judge Kelly believe?

There’s not much to go on. Prior to becoming a judge, Jane Kelly served as a public defender for 17 years, which afforded few opportunities for making public statements on the finer points of jurisprudence.

But she has been an appellate court judge for the past three years, and during that time has written 82 opinions for the court. Over the past week, I have read and reviewed all of them.

This does not necessarily mean Judge Kelly is “tough on crime.” The national reversal rate for criminal appeals is only 7 percent, which makes sense, given the heightened standards of review at the appellate level.

Axsom, the Eighth Circuit affirmed a 15-year-jail sentence for a child pornography conviction stemming solely from 15 images traded on Limewire (a peer-to-peer technology where batches of files may be shared without an individual’s knowledge of what’s inside).

In another child porn case, the court affirmed conviction even though the state showed five minutes’ worth of images to the jury, an act which had no evidentiary value but likely disgusted and prejudiced the jurors. It’s easy to imagine these two cases going the other way under a more liberal judge.

When it comes to police conduct, Judge Kelly again appears to be a centrist. Most of her Fourth Amendment opinions (US v. Meidel, Fagnan v. Lino Lakes, Greenman v. Jessen, US v. Guevara, Yang v. Roy, US v. Thompson) find for the police and against defendants complaining of unconstitutional search or seizure. Again, that is usually the case.

But there are some exceptions.

In Peterson v. Kopp, Judge Kelly wrote an opinion granting immunity to an arresting officer for most of his actions, but not for pepper-spraying a defendant who asked to see his badge. That, Judge Kelly wrote, was a First Amendment violation. And in Ziesmer v. Hagen, the appeals court overturned a lower court opinion and allowed a police officer to be sued for injuring someone pulled over at a roadside stop, in an arrest that led to no criminal charges. In these cases, one might imagine a more conservative judge siding with police.

When it comes to hot-button issues that would come up in nomination hearings, Judge Kelly’s record is also right up the middle.

In Jackson v. Nixon, Judge Kelly wrote a 2-1 opinion upholding an atheist prisoner’s claim that being effectively forced to participate in an Alcoholics Anonymous-like substance abuse program violated his First Amendment rights to be free from religious coercion. (A similar appeal from a Native American objecting to a 12-step program was rejected, but mostly on procedural grounds.)

This could be read in several ways. Though the petitioner is an atheist, this is actually a conservative-style, pro-religious-liberty holding, not unlike the recent Supreme Court case of Holt v. Hobbs, which required an Arkansas prison to let a Muslim prisoner grow a half-inch-long beard. In terms of the current debates over religious liberty and civil rights laws, Jackson is on the side of individual religious liberty (here, to be free of religious coercion) over a particular public policy (in this case, the rehab program).

On the other hand, affirming an atheist’s First Amendment rights to be free from the relatively anodyne spirituality of 12-step programs could also be read as extremely liberal. Is the program’s suggestion to substitute “Good Orderly Direction” for the word “God” really religious coercion? Whether Jackson is a conservative or liberal opinion depends on how you look at it.

On another hot-button issue, immigration, Judge Kelly wrote eight opinions on deportation appeals, affirming seven of them. While, again, standards of review favor upholding the decisions of immigration officials, no one could argue that Judge Kelly is soft on illegal immigration. She affirmed the deportation of a former child slave from Mexico, a Chinese woman fearing reprisal for having three children, and a victim of gang violence (PDF).

Of the eight deportation appeals, the only one Judge Kelly wrote to remand was from an individual who had the help of a fraudulent assistant (PDF). Here, Judge Kelly wrote, the entire application should not have been dismissed simply because the preparer was a liar.

Finally, Judge Kelly wrote a contentious 2-1 opinion in the case of US v. Fast Horse (the Eighth Circuit has jurisdiction over several Native American lands). In that case, Judge Kelly reversed a conviction for sexual assault, because the defendant may not have known that his victim couldn’t consent. Judge Steven Colloton filed an angry dissent.

Even here, however, the tea leaves can be read in opposing ways. On the one hand, this is an opinion that makes it harder for women to prevail against sexual predators, which might anger some liberals. On the other hand, it sides with a criminal defendant over the state, which might anger some conservatives.

Perhaps most notably, Fast Horse relied on a particular (and controversial) Eighth Circuit precedent regarding the intent necessary to prove a rape claim: that the defendant must know the victim did not, or could not, consent. (The dissent attacked this court for “vacat[ing] yet another conviction of a sexual aggressor who engaged in sexual intercourse with a woman who was passed out or asleep.”) This is interesting because judicial nominees often use pat phrases like “I would follow Supreme Court precedent” to avoid answering questions about abortion. Here, however, is an appellate judge actually doing it: applying a precedent which some might find dubious, because it is the controlling law in the case.

Now, that could apply to Roe v. Wade but also to Citizens United. Which, finally, is the point. Over the course of 82 opinions, Judge Kelly emerges as a thoughtful centrist who would disappoint ideologues on the left and the right. There is no consistent bias in her opinions, and the fact that they may be read in multiple ways attests (for better or for worse) to their centrism.

Contrary to Ted Cruz’s outrageous statement at last night’s GOP debate that anyone Harry Reid supports must be a constitutional liberal, Judge Kelly’s record, to the extent it can be interpreted, suggests judicial moderation. It may not matter in today’s Senate, but if President Obama is looking for a consensus candidate, it’s hard to imagine a better one. Jane Kelly’s opinions are boring in all the right ways.",www.thedailybeast.com,left,75nK15F6HzlvNYfq

That’s a pretty good description of the sound and fury signifying nothing on display this week from Democrats and protesters alike.

The central complaint of the Democrats is that they haven’t been given access to records from Kavanaugh’s time working in the Bush administration. They demand their release by the current White House, or the Senate Judiciary Committee, or Kavanaugh, or, perhaps by this writing, Aslan the Lion, deity of Narnia.

Explaining the ginned-up controversy would be a waste of time, because the point of these demands merely is to put on an absurdist drama in which the finale is never in doubt.

Judge Brett Kavanaugh, an indisputably qualified nominee, even according to the typically liberal American Bar Association, will be confirmed no matter what the Democrats do and no matter how many indecipherable yawps get shouted by the hysterics in the hearing room.

The most obvious proof that this is all theater, isn’t The Handmaid’s Tale cosplayers outside the hearing rooms, it’s the senators most passionately shouting that they require more information despite already declaring they won’t vote for Kavanaugh, no matter what that information reveals.

One of the lead protagonists of this drama, New Jersey senator Cory Booker, exclaimed Thursday morning that “this is the closest I’ll ever get in my life to an ‘I am Spartacus’ moment,” and threatened to divulge confidential documents to the public, even if it meant risking losing his job.

“I am going to release the email about racial profiling, and I understand that the penalty comes with potential ousting from the Senate,” Booker declared.

Again, because nothing actually matters when the goal is to create dramatic sound bites for Twitter and TV and your 2020 presidential campaign videos, he later insisted that he wasn’t breaking the rules by releasing confidential documents.

He was right the first time: It is against the rules to release confidential documents.

Booker was hardly alone in the forced buffoonery. More than a dozen of his fellow Democrats joined in the rebellion against Senate rules, in effect shouting “I am Spartacus” too, and with mawkish bravery dared the Senate to expel them.

But all this Sturm und Drang on the public stage was pointless.

Indeed, the documents he ended up releasing had already been cleared for public viewing — and Booker reportedly knew that beforehand, but pretended otherwise. Gotta stay in character.

Oh, and the ominous email “about racial profiling” Booker released? It showed that Kavanaugh was opposed to racial profiling.

In Yiddish humor, which has its own absurdist bent, a schlemiel is a clumsy person who often spills his soup, and a schlimazel is the sort of chronically unlucky person the soup lands on. Booker achieved a double play: He spilled the soup on himself.

Nebraska senator Ben Sasse, in one of the best opening statements of any hearing I’ve ever heard, cut through it all.

“Since your nomination in July,” Sasse said, “you’ve been accused of hating women, hating children, hating clean air, wanting dirty water. You’ve been declared an existential threat to our nation. Alumni of Yale Law School, incensed that faculty members at your alma mater praised your selection, wrote a public letter to the school saying, quote, ‘People will die if Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed.’”

“This drivel is patently absurd,” he continued, “and I worry that we’re going to hear more of it over the next few days. But the good news is, it is absurd, and the American people don’t believe any of it.”

Sasse eloquently expanded on a point I’ve been banging my spoon on my highchair about for a while now: The legislative branch is becoming a parliament of pundits, in which both parties teem with people desperate to emote, preen, and shriek for voters and donors who follow politics like it’s a form of entertainment, and, in this case, a theater of the absurd.

Instead of picking a jurist with an expedient , built-in constituency , whose confirmation fight with the Republican Senate could be used as leverage in the November elections , Obama appeared to strip the nomination of any overt political subtext by offering forth the most bipartisan , even-tempered name on his Supreme Court short list .
Seasoned court watchers had favored fellow D.C . Circuit Court judge Sri Srinivasan for the Supreme Court nod , citing the 49-year-old ’ s bipartisan background , sterling ( but brief ) credentials , and his ability to mobilize minority voters in the upcoming elections . Jeffrey Toobin , who had once called Srinivasan a “ nominee-in-waiting , ” had predicted shortly after Antonin Scalia ’ s death that he would be the pick , as did several other outlets . Garland , on the other hand , does little to excite the Democratic base , while offering about the same chance of being successfully confirmed : none . Within hours of Scalia ’ s death , Republican Senate leaders vowed not to confirm , or even meet with , any Obama nominee , arguing that the next president should get the opportunity to fill the late justice ’ s seat .
On the surface , the decision to nominate the 63-year-old is somewhat perplexing . “ On paper , Garland is exactly the sort of candidate one might expect President Obama to appoint at this time , meaning relatively conservative , a moderate who doesn ’ t have a lot of enemies , who is on the second most powerful court in the land , ” noted ABC ’ s chief legal correspondent and LawNewz owner , Dan Abrams , who admitted he was surprised by the announcement . But Garland lacks the kind of background that would “ pressure ” Republicans in this political environment , he said , whereas Srinavasan ’ s youth and Asian-American heritage would have mobilized Democratic interest groups to lobby on his behalf . “ He doesn ’ t have the kind of political juice to force the Republicans ’ hand that other candidates would . ”
In many ways , Garland makes more sense as a sacrificial lamb . In floor remarks immediately after Obama ’ s announcement , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reiterated that he would not break his promise to block any Obama nominee , arguing that his opposition was based on principle , and not “ about a person. ” Obama surely knew that Garland , despite being widely respected for his 19 years on the D.C . Circuit Court , would never be nominated before November . If Hillary Clinton wins the election , Republicans would likely race to nominate Garland in the ensuing lame-duck session , preempting Clinton from picking her own more progressive nominee . And it would preserve the reputation of a potential future candidate , like Srinavasan , if Garland is forced to withdraw . Either way , Garland—who was confirmed 76 to 23 to the D.C . Circuit Court in 1997—will test the depths of the G.O.P. ’ s opposition to Obama .
Garland ’ s centrism is also , in many ways , in line with how Obama has maneuvered to shape his own political legacy , going all the way back to his years at the head of the Harvard Law Review . At the time , Obama surprised his fellow liberals by reaching out to conservatives and appointing them to editorial positions , in an attempt to bridge the partisan divide then polarizing the campus . That animating belief in the promise of bipartisanship drove his political career , beginning with his 2004 Democratic convention speech , in which he declared there was no blue or red America , up through the 2008 election , when he ran on a platform of ending Bush-era divisions in Washington . Despite seven long years of unprecedented Republican opposition , it was a theme Obama returned to again in his final State of the Union address , in which he urged Americans to overcome mutual suspicion and work together . The nomination of Garland , a fellow Harvard man , is a fitting bookend for a president who tried and failed , and is perhaps now trying again , to make post-partisanship a central theme of his presidency . “ I think that President Obama likes and respects Merrick Garland enormously , ” Abrams told me . “ I also think that if this were two years ago , my guess is that President Obama may have nominated somebody else . ”
As Obama spoke Wednesday in the Rose Garden about the legacy he wanted to leave America , his words seemed to echo that hopeful rhetoric . “ This is precisely the time when we should play it straight , and treat the process of appointing a Supreme Court justice with the seriousness and care it deserves , ” he said bluntly . “ It ’ s supposed to be above politics . It has to be . And it should stay that way . ”","With the announcement Wednesday that President Barack Obama would nominate centrist appeals court judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court, the White House caught the Washington political establishment by surprise.

The nomination of Garland, a fellow Harvard man, is a fitting bookend for a president who tried and failed, and is perhaps now trying again, to make post-partisanship a central theme of his presidency. “I think that President Obama likes and respects Merrick Garland enormously,” Abrams told me. “I also think that if this were two years ago, my guess is that President Obama may have nominated somebody else.”

As Obama spoke Wednesday in the Rose Garden about the legacy he wanted to leave America, his words seemed to echo that hopeful rhetoric. “This is precisely the time when we should play it straight, and treat the process of appointing a Supreme Court justice with the seriousness and care it deserves,” he said bluntly. “It’s supposed to be above politics. It has to be. And it should stay that way.”",www.vanityfair.com,left,FCQycWD6YZ5gZFJG

As the presidential race heads into the home stretch, the Supreme Court is poised to wade into a series of contentious issues that neither President Barack Obama nor Mitt Romney seems eager to discuss.

The justices begin their next term on Monday. Smack in the middle of the presidential debates next month, they’re scheduled to take up the racially polarizing question of affirmative action. Around the same time, the court could announce that it’s jumping into the fray over same-sex marriage.

And just eight days before voters head the polls, the justices will hear their first case relating to the federal government’s so-called terrorist surveillance program that allows tapping phones and email communications as part of the war on terror.

None of these subjects come up often this year on the campaign trail — and all are topics the candidates have reasons to avoid. Justices aren’t likely to rule on any of them before the election. But after the historic, 5-4 decision last term upholding the crux of Obama’s signature health law, the high court’s docket could once again reverberate in the presidential race.

The case on the University of Texas’s affirmative action program, set to be argued Oct. 10, could resurrect an issue that has slipped off the national political radar for more than a decade. The first presidential debate, on domestic issues, takes place exactly one week before that. The vice presidential debate is Oct. 11.

“I’ve got to believe at this point in the campaign neither the president or Governor Romney is going to want to give a quote on any of this,” said Richard Taylor, a business diversity advocate and former Massachusetts transportation secretary under Romney. “If I was preparing either candidate for the debate, this would be on the checklist, … but I don’t think either campaign will be anxious to talk about it.”

In court briefs, the Obama administration has backed the University of Texas’s right to run its affirmative action program. It’s being challenged by Abigail Fisher, a white undergraduate applicant who was denied admission. But Obama aides have a history of being skittish about getting publicly enmeshed in debates over race — and education-related affirmative action in particular.

A federal government policy statement on the use of race in education languished in protracted interagency debates until last December.

“It took three long years to pull that policy out of the Obama administration. It was only after we pestered and cajoled them that they finally got it out,” John Brittain, a civil rights activist and law professor at the University of the District of Columbia, said in an interview soon after the document was released. “The administration had a paralysis of analysis. ….

As the oldest justices on the bench , Ginsburg and Breyer have faced recurring questions about retirement . When asked , Ginsburg has often replied that she would continue working on the court “ as long as I can do it full steam . ”
Ginsburg , who is considered the leader of the court ’ s liberal wing , has survived a total of four bouts with cancer since being appointed to the Supreme Court by former President Clinton in 1993 .
Most recently , she underwent treatment earlier this month for a benign gallbladder condition . While recovering in the hospital , Ginsburg called in to oral arguments , which the Supreme Court held remotely by teleconference as part of its response to the coronavirus pandemic .
Ginsburg was expected to return to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore over the following weeks for follow-up outpatient visits and to have a gallstone non-surgically removed , a court spokeswoman said .
Earlier this term , Ginsburg missed a day of oral arguments in November due to a stomach bug but returned to work later that week . She missed oral arguments for the first time during the previous court term while recovering from surgery to remove two cancerous nodules from her lung .
The justice sounded a positive note earlier this year about the state of her health when she announced publicly for the first time that she was cancer-free . But her recurring health episodes have caused some to worry about her longevity on the bench .
Neither Ginsburg nor Breyer are expected to retire while the Republican Party is in control over their successors .
According to the legal industry website Above The Law , both Ginsburg and Thomas have hired at least two clerks so far for next term , and Breyer has hired a clerk for the term that begins October 2021 .
A spokeswoman for the Supreme Court did not respond to a request for comment .
Studies have shown that justices are more likely to retire when the White House is held by the same party as the president who appointed them , sometimes referred to as a “ strategic retirement . ”
Over nearly the past 50 years , “ strategic retirements have been more the rule than the exception , ” Scott Lemieux , a political science professor at the University of Washington , wrote in a Washington Post op-ed last year .
“ The only justices since 1968 who resigned while still alive and with a president they weren ’ t positively disposed to on ideological or partisan grounds were [ William ] Brennan and Thurgood Marshall , who waited as long as they could during a 12-year run of Republican control of the White House but were ultimately forced off the court by serious health issues , ” Lemieux wrote .
Both Ginsburg and Breyer have signaled that the ideological makeup of the court they would leave behind is a factor in their thinking .
In a recent interview with Axios , Breyer said that who the president is and the court ’ s future ideological balance were `` not totally irrelevant '' considerations for justices weighing when to leave the bench .
But when asked about retirement , Breyer , a Clinton nominee , said , `` I do n't really think about it , '' and added , `` I enjoy what I 'm doing . ''
Breyer has had no known health scares other than a fractured shoulder he sustained in a bicycle accident in 2013 .
The other justices , nominated by Obama and former President George W. Bush , as well as Trump ’ s two picks , are not often mentioned in terms of possible near-term vacancies .
Even if no surprise vacancy opens up on the bench , the Supreme Court may well be a factor in many voters ’ minds come November .
In coming weeks , the court is expected to issue rulings that could determine the fate of Trump ’ s tax returns , LGBT rights in the workplace and the deportation status of nearly 700,000 young undocumented immigrants .","Just months before Election Day, the question of whether President Trump Donald John TrumpFauci says his meetings with Trump have 'dramatically decreased' McEnany criticizes DC mayor for not imposing earlier curfew amid protests Stopping Israel's annexation is a US national security interest MORE will get to select a third Supreme Court justice hangs over the final weeks of the court’s term.

Mitchell , who was hired by the Senate Judiciary Committee to assist Republicans , addressed the letter to “ All Republican Senators , ” and said no senator approved the memo . She noted in the assessment that she is a Republican , but said she is not a political person .

Mitchell, who was hired by the Senate Judiciary Committee to assist Republicans, addressed the letter to “All Republican Senators,” and said no senator approved the memo. She noted in the assessment that she is a Republican, but said she is not a political person.

She identified Ford's case as an example of “he said, she said,” and said her case is “even weaker than that.”

Ford, a California psychology professor, claims Kavanaugh assaulted her while at a house party in the 1980s when they were both teenagers. She said he pinned her to a bed, attempted to forcibly remove her clothes and prevented her from screaming.

Ford said she was ""100 precent"" certain that Kavanaugh was her attacker.

Kavanaugh has vehemently denied the allegations.

Mitchell, who worked as a sex-crimes prosecutor for nearly 25 years in Arizona, pointed out what she identified as timing inconsistencies. She wrote that Ford appeared to jump around on the timing of the alleged sexual assault, ranging from the “mid 1980s” to “early 1980s,” and then the “summer of 1982.”

On the Saturday afternoon last February when he received word of Justice Scalia ’ s death , Neil M. Gorsuch “ immediately lost [ his ] breath ” and “ couldn ’ t see . . . for the tears . ”
In his grief over the death of a justice he deeply admired and emulated , Judge Gorsuch could hardly have imagined the series of events that would lead to his being selected today to fill the Scalia vacancy . And while he has rightly recognized that no one could ever replace Justice Scalia , there are strong reasons to expect Justice Gorsuch to be an eminently worthy successor to the great justice .
Gorsuch is a brilliant jurist and dedicated originalist and textualist . He thinks through issues deeply . He writes with clarity , force , and verve . And his many talents promise to give him an outsized influence on future generations of lawyers .
Gorsuch ’ s judicial outlook is reflected in his beautiful speech ( text and video ) celebrating — and embracing — Justice Scalia ’ s traditional understanding of the judicial role and his originalist methodology :
Perhaps the great project of Justice Scalia ’ s career was to remind us of the differences between judges and legislators . To remind us that legislators may appeal to their own moral convictions and to claims about social utility to reshape the law as they think it should be in the future . But that judges should do none of these things in a democratic society . That judges should instead strive ( if humanly and so imperfectly ) to apply the law as it is , focusing backward , not forward , and looking to text , structure , and history to decide what a reasonable reader at the time of the events in question would have understood the law to be—not to decide cases based on their own moral convictions or the policy consequences they believe might serve society best .
In that speech , Gorsuch acknowledges that Justice Scalia ’ s project had its critics , from the secular moralist Ronald Dworkin to the pragmatist Richard Posner . He explains why he rejects those critics and instead sides with Justice Scalia in believing that “ an assiduous focus on text , structure , and history is essential to the proper exercise of the judicial function. ” The Constitution itself carefully separates the legislative and judicial powers . Whereas the legislative power is the “ power to prescribe new rules of general applicability for the future , ” the judicial power is a “ means for resolving disputes about what existing law is and how it applies to discrete cases and controversies. ” This separation of powers is “ among the most important liberty-protecting devices of the constitutional design. ” Among other things , if judges were to act as legislators by imposing their preferences as constitutional dictates , “ how hard it would be to revise this so-easily-made judicial legislation to account for changes in the world or to fix mistakes. ” Indeed , the “ very idea of self-government would seem to wither to the point of pointlessness . ”
‘ American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom , relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box. ’ — Neil Gorsuch
As Gorsuch put it ( in Cordova v. City of Albuquerque ) , the Constitution “ isn ’ t some inkblot on which litigants may project their hopes and dreams . . . , but a carefully drafted text judges are charged with applying according to its original public meaning ” ( emphasis added ) . In his one foray as a ███ Online contributor , in 2005 ( before he took the bench ) , Gorsuch lamented that “ American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom , relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box , as the primary means of effecting their social agenda on everything from gay marriage to assisted suicide to the use of vouchers for private-school education . ”
At 49 years of age , Gorsuch has already served for more than a decade on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit , which reviews decisions of the federal district courts in the states of Colorado , Kansas , New Mexico , Oklahoma , Utah , and Wyoming . His judicial record ( which I am detailing more extensively in a series of posts on NRO ’ s Bench Memos blog ) is remarkably impressive .
On issues of religious liberty , Gorsuch has an especially strong record . In 2013 , he determined that Hobby Lobby was entitled under the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act to relief from the HHS Obamacare mandate that would have required it to provide its employees insurance coverage for abortifacient drugs and devices . ( By a 5–4 vote , the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby in 2014 . ) In 2015 , he objected vigorously to a Tenth Circuit ruling that held that the massive fines that the Obama administration threatened to impose on the Little Sisters of the Poor for refusing to facilitate insurance coverage for contraceptives and abortifacients did not seriously implicate their religious liberty . ( In 2016 , the Supreme Court sent the case back to the Tenth Circuit to enable the government to work out a more sensible approach . )
Gorsuch has also fought against a hyper-expansive reading of the establishment clause that would exclude religion from the public square . In 2009 ( in Green v. Haskell County Board of Commissioners ) , he disputed a panel decision that ruled that a county ’ s Ten Commandments display was unconstitutional . He memorably complained that the panel ’ s hypothetical “ reasonable observer ” — whose imagined perceptions dictate what does and does not violate the establishment clause — was not “ someone who got things right ” but was instead “ an admittedly unreasonable ” observer who “ just gets things wrong ” “ because , the panel tells us , our observer is from a small town , where such errors can not be helped. ” In another case ( American Atheists , Inc. v. Davenport ) , he disagreed with a panel ruling that Utah violated the establishment clause when it allowed the private Utah Highway Patrol Association to memorialize troopers killed in the line of duty by erecting large white crosses on public property near the locations of their deaths . The Tenth Circuit ’ s “ reasonable observer , ” in his view , “ continues to be biased , replete with foibles , and prone to mistake ” ( as well as “ a bit of a hot-rodder ” ) .
Gorsuch has earned special acclaim for his insights on administrative law and separation of powers . In an opinion last August ( Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch ) , he argued that the Supreme Court ’ s precedents on deference to reasonable agency interpretations of law “ permit executive bureaucracies to swallow huge amounts of core judicial and legislative power and concentrate federal power in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution of the framers ’ design. ” He called for the Supreme Court to reconsider whether the so-called Chevron doctrine of deference is sound . In another recent opinion ( United States v. Nichols ) , he said that Congress had gone too far in delegating power to an agency to decide what conduct is criminal : For Congress to “ effectively pass off to the prosecutor the job of defining the very crime he is responsible for enforcing ” is “ by any plausible measure . . . a delegation run riot , a result inimical to the people ’ s liberty and our constitutional design . ”
Gorsuch dissented strenuously when the Tenth Circuit refused to reconsider a panel ruling in favor of Planned Parenthood ’ s Utah affiliate .
Gorsuch has had only one case involving the matter of abortion ( Planned Parenthood of Utah v. Herbert ) . Last October , he dissented strenuously when the Tenth Circuit refused to reconsider a panel ruling in favor of Planned Parenthood ’ s Utah affiliate . The panel had granted Planned Parenthood a preliminary injunction against the Utah governor ’ s directive to state agencies to stop acting as intermediaries for federal funds flowing to Planned Parenthood . Gorsuch faulted the panel for failing to accord the appropriate degree of deference to the district court ’ s factual findings and for making its own bizarre inferences about the governor ’ s reasons for acting .
In a case involving a firearms conviction ( United States v. Games-Perez ) , Gorsuch protested that “ people sit in prison because our circuit ’ s case law allows the government to put them there without proving a statutorily specified element of the charged crime. ” In support of his interpretation of the statute , Gorsuch invoked , quoting Justice Thomas , the “ long tradition of widespread lawful gun ownership by private individuals in this country ” and the Supreme Court ’ s recognition that the Second Amendment “ protects an individual ’ s right to own firearms and may not be infringed lightly . ”
On criminal law and procedure , Gorsuch has a strong and balanced record . He has protected the privacy rights of Americans while respecting the proper powers of the police . Reversing a lower court , he concluded that when law-enforcement officers open and examine private e-mails , they are engaging in a search governed by the Fourth Amendment . He has argued , in dissent , that a homeowner who posted No Trespassing signs all over her property didn ’ t consent to police entering her property and knocking on her front door . But he has also explained that the Fourth Amendment must be applied in a manner that “ takes a realistic view of human capacities and limitations . ”
Gorsuch has complained that the overcriminalization of “ so many facets of daily life [ means ] that prosecutors can almost choose their targets with impunity. ” He has insisted that laws and regulations provide clear notice of what is prohibited , and he has prevented police officers from being held personally liable for conduct that wasn ’ t clearly unlawful .
Neil Gorsuch combines an appealing Rocky Mountain profile with a stellar personal history . He has deep roots in his hometown of Denver and absorbed his work ethic from his family . One of his grandfathers worked his way through law school with a job as a streetcar conductor in Denver . The other grew up in an Irish tenement in Denver and , at the age of eight , began working to support his family as a porter at a train station . Both of his parents were lawyers in Denver . His mother , Anne Gorsuch Burford , was one of the first women to work as a prosecutor in Denver , was twice elected to the Colorado legislature , and was President Reagan ’ s first head of the EPA .
In his youth , Gorsuch worked a variety of everyday jobs : shoveling snow , moving furniture , working the front desk at a Howard Johnson ’ s hotel .

A new state electoral map, devised by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court after it invalidated the Republican-drawn districts in January, is seen as giving Democrats a better shot at gaining seats in the U.S. House of Representatives in the Nov. 6 congressional elections in which President Donald Trump’s fellow Republicans are seeking to retain control of Congress.

The case involves a practice called partisan gerrymandering in which electoral maps are drafted in a manner that helps one party tighten its grip on power by undermining the clout of voters that tend to favor the other party. The high court in June failed to determine whether partisan gerrymandering violates the U.S. Constitution after hearing high-profile cases from Wisconsin and Maryland.

The justices, with no noted dissents, on Monday rejected the Republican appeal of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling throwing out the previous Republican-drawn map because it violated the state constitution’s requirement that elections be “free and equal” by marginalizing Democratic voters.

The high court previously rejected two Republican requests to block the new district boundaries that the state high court issued to replace the old map, which had been in effect since 2011.

GOP leaders , caught in the undertow of an election in which the conservative grass-roots are already in revolt , immediately renewed their refusal to consider Garland , 63 , saying their reservations were not personal but motivated by a desire for the American people to weigh in on Scalia 's replacement . The showdown is even more fraught than most Supreme Court fights , since Obama 's choice could tilt the ideological balance of the court away from conservatives -- possibly for years .
In a speech in the evocative ceremonial surroundings of the White House Rose Garden , Obama praised Garland as `` one of America 's sharpest legal minds , '' making a case that he was so eminently qualified for the job in terms of legal learning , experience and temperament that any attempt to ignore his appointment could only be the result of base political motivations .
`` I have selected a nominee who is widely recognized not only as one of America 's sharpest legal minds , but someone who brings to his work a spirit of decency modesty , integrity , evenhandedness and excellence , '' Obama said . These qualities and his long commitment to public service have earned him the respect and admiration from leaders from both sides of the aisle . ''
Senate Republicans do not plan to vet or have hearings on Garland , let alone a vote on his nomination . Obama and Democrats argue that with 10 months left in his term , there is plenty of time for the Senate to take up and confirm a new justice . The gravity of Obama 's announcement on Wednesday was part of an attempt to pressure Republicans , especially senators with an eye on their own legacies or those who face tough re-election fights , to peel away from their leadership .

But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the GOP chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , Chuck Grassley of Iowa , have both expressed little leeway in their determination to forgo hearings for Obama 's nominee .
`` The American people may well elect a president who decides to nominate Judge Garland for Senate consideration , '' McConnell said Wednesday . `` The next president may also nominate someone very different . Either way , our view is this : Give the people a voice in the filling of this vacancy . ''
`` Rather than put Judge Garland through more unnecessary political routines orchestrated by the White House , the leader decided it would be more considerate of the nominee 's time to speak with him today by phone , '' McConnell spokesman Don Stewart said . `` And since the Senate will not be acting on this nomination , he would not be holding a perfunctory meeting , but he wished Judge Garland well . ''
Garland , the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit , has been on short lists before . An appointee of President Bill Clinton , Garland is a graduate of Harvard and Harvard Law School . As a Justice Department lawyer , he supervised investigations in the Unabomber case as well as the Oklahoma City bombing .
His voice cracking with emotion , Garland called Obama 's decision to nominate him `` the greatest honor of my life . ''
`` For me , their could be no higher public service than serving as a member of the Supreme Court , '' Garland said .
Obama 's announcement amplifies the ongoing political battle over the precedent and propriety of considering a Supreme Court nomination amid a heated presidential election .
The announcement comes after a big night in the 2016 election , with both party 's front-runners -- Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump -- emerging with sweeping victories as they march toward their respective nominations . Some believed Obama would time his pick so it would n't get lost in a news cycle dominated by election results . But the timing seems suited to directly insert the selection into the political conversation .
Fueling the argument is the potential for the first shift in the court 's ideological leaning in two decades . If confirmed , Obama 's nominee will likely offer a vastly different legal outlook that Scalia , who was considered one of the court 's most conservative members .
CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the pick of Garland , who is well-respected in legal circles `` takes the issue of qualifications off the table , '' but noted the fight now is all about politics . ''
`` He is the chief judge of the second most important court in the country , but the political calculation here is , I think , quite clear , '' Toobin said . `` President Obama is saying to the Senate Republicans , you can take my 63-year-old now or wait for President Hillary Clinton to bring up a 45-year-old in 10 months . ''
At 63 , Garland is much older than the other contenders on the short list such as Judges Sri Srinivasan , Paul Watford and Jane Kelly . Garland 's supporters argue he is the nominee that the senators could n't refuse even in a contentious environment .

`` It is my intention to nominate somebody who has impeccable credentials , somebody who should be a consensus candidate , '' Obama told CNN en Español anchor Juan Carlos Lopez in an interview last week .
This is Obama 's third nomination to the high court . Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were confirmed in 2009 and 2010 , respectively . But those confirmation hearings and votes occurred when Democrats were firmly in control of the Senate .
Democrats have already begun a campaign to pressure Republicans into considering Obama 's nomination . In their sights : vulnerable senators up for reelection , some of whom are already facing backlash from opponents for refusing to consider even a hypothetical Obama nominee .
The White House launched a Twitter account , @ SCOTUSnom , designed to promote the nomination as well .
But while some moderate Republicans have expressed willingness to meet with the nominee , their ability to force hearings before the full judiciary panel appear slim .
A McConnell aide said noted the Kentucky senator voted against Garland when he was confirmed to the appeals court in 1997 and argued Obama 's choice is a recognition that this pick not getting through -- otherwise the President would have picked a younger nominee who would serve longer .
Sen. Pat Roberts , one of seven current Republicans to vote for Garland in 1997 , told CNN he will not back the judge now .
`` It 's not about the person . It 's about the process . Let the people decide , '' Roberts said .
Asked why he voted for Garland previously , Roberts replied , `` I supported him . ''
Trump said he agrees with the stance of the Hill Republicans . `` I think the next president should make the pick . And I think they should n't go forward . And I believe I 'm pretty much in line with what the Republicans are saying , '' Trump told CNN 's Chris Cuomo Wednesday on `` New Day . ''
Toobin said it will be difficult for them to change tactics now .
`` I do n't see how at this point they can go back on this promise , '' not to move on the nominee , Toobin said Wednesday morning .
Polls show most Americans support giving a nominee a congressional hearing . A CNN/ORC survey taken late last month indicated sizable majorities of Republicans , Democrats and independents want Senate Republican leaders to hold hearings on the nominee .
Grassley last week said the Senate retained a prerogative to forgo hearings for Obama 's selection .
`` It is n't any different if the President of the United States notifies Congress well in advance of a piece of legislation that he 's going to veto it , '' Grassley said at a Judiciary panel hearing , citing criticism from Republicans over the role of the high court .
`` Whether it 's today or tomorrow or whether it 's for the next seven or eight months , this is a very important debate that we ought to have about the Constitution and about not only who 's going to be a replacement for Justice Scalia but about the role of the Supreme Court , '' he added . `` At the grassroots of America , there 's a real feeling of 'Is the Supreme Court doing what the Constitution requires ? ' ''
The announcement comes 32 days after Scalia 's death , only slightly longer than it took him to name his two previous appointments to the high court . Unlike his nominations of Sotomayor and Kagan , the vacancy this time was n't expected . White House officials have said they were n't anticipating another Supreme Court nomination during Obama 's term ahead of Scalia 's death .
Obama oversaw a team led by his counsel Neil Eggleston , chief of staff Denis McDonough , and his senior adviser Brian Deese to select and vet a group of potential nominees . After conducting interviews last week , Obama narrowed his list to include Merrick , Watford and Srinivasan , each of them considered `` consensus '' candidates for their history in gaining confirmation support from Republicans .

The ruling in the New York dispute makes it more likely that Trump's tax returns are eventually made public, though it’s unclear if they would be disclosed before the November general election. More fundamentally, the decision flatly rejects Trump’s argument that a sitting president enjoys absolute immunity from investigations.

Retiring Republican Rep. Lynn Jenkins holds the seat, and Democrats hope to flip it. Both joined him on stage at the Expocentre to speak.

Trump has been holding rallies across the country as he tries to boost Republican turnout in November's midterm elections, which will determine which party will control the House and Senate during the second half of Trump's term.

He said Saturday he thinks Republicans ""are going to do incredibly well"" in the elections after Kavanaugh's confirmation.

""I think we have a momentum that hasn't been seen in years,"" he said.

Mr. Trump , who has installed twice as many judges on the federal bench as President Barack Obama had done by the same time in office , announced Friday a list of five more candidates he ’ ll consider for the next Supreme Court vacancy .
The new list of candidates for the high court includes Judge Brett Kavanaugh , a conservative stalwart on the high-profile U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit who clerked for Justice Anthony M. Kennedy , and Judge Amy Barrett of the 7th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals , an outspoken opponent of the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion .
Rounding out the list are Judge Britt Grant of the Georgia Supreme Court , Judge Kevin Newsom of the 11th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals and Oklahoma Supreme Court Justice Patrick Wyrick . Judge Grant previously clerked for Judge Kavanaugh on the appeals court .
While there are no vacancies on the high court , there has been persistent speculation about possible retirements , including liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and centrist Justice Kennedy .
The White House said the new candidates , who are added to the president ’ s original campaign list of 20 potential judicial nominees , are in the mold of Supreme Court Justice Neil M. Gorsuch .
“ President Trump will choose a nominee for a future Supreme Court vacancy , should one arise , from this updated list of 25 individuals , ” the White House said . “ The president remains deeply committed to identifying and selecting outstanding jurists in the mold of Justice Gorsuch . These additions , like those on the original list released more than a year ago , were selected with input from respected conservative leaders . ”
Judicial Crisis Network chief counsel and policy director Carrie Severino called the new candidates “ some of the best and brightest judges in the nation . ”
“ These men and women have spent years in the trenches of state and federal government fighting for the Constitution and the rule of law , ” she said . “ They represent a diverse range of backgrounds , including both state and federal judges — three who were former state solicitors general with first-hand experience protecting our constitutional balance of powers . ”
In his first year in office , Mr. Trump has already appointed eight federal appeals court judges , the most at this point in a presidency since President Richard Nixon . The Senate is expected to confirm the ninth appellate judicial nominee — former Trump deputy White House counsel Gregory Katsas — within weeks .
The Senate has now confirmed 14 Trump judicial nominees overall . By this point of his presidency in 2009 , Mr. Obama had only seven judges confirmed .
Conservative leaders have been pressuring Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to pick up the pace of judicial confirmations . And the GOP could lose another seat from its thin 52-48 majority next month in Alabama ’ s special Senate election , where Republican nominee Roy Moore is embroiled in multiple accusations of sexual harassment . He denies the allegations .
White House counsel Don McGahn said Mr. Trump ’ s judicial nominees demonstrate his commitment to conservative jurists who won ’ t make new law .
“ They have a demonstrated commitment to originalism and textualism … there ’ s nothing unknown about them , ” Mr. McGahn said of the new candidates at a Federalist Society event on Friday . “ What you see is what you get . I ’ m very fortunate to serve a president who is very committed to what we are here , which is nominating and appointing committed originalists and textualists . He ’ s made good on what he said . ”
Mr. Trump has a rare opportunity to reshape the judiciary , inheriting 100 vacancies , twice as many as Mr. Obama inherited . There are currently 160 judicial vacancies , including 18 on appellate courts and 118 on district courts .
“ When the history books are written about the Trump administration , I believe perhaps the most long-lasting and significant legacy will be the men and women appointed and confirmed to the federal bench , ” said Sen. Ted Cruz , Texas Republican , at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last week .
Committee for Justice President Curt Levey said conservatives are “ especially pleased ” to see Judge Barrett on the president ’ s new list .
“ It sends a clear signal to Democrat senators that anti-Catholic or any other type of religious bias in the appointment of federal judges will not be tolerated , ” Mr. Levey said . “ The Committee for Justice has been at the forefront of opposing this type of bias dating back to its defense of U.S. Court of Appeals nominee Bill Pryor in 2003 , including our ‘ Catholics Need Not Apply ’ ads , which put Senate Democrats on the defensive after they criticized Pryor for being Catholic , and continues to exert influence as it is still discussed to this day . ”
He said Mr. Trump ’ s new list will “ invigorate his supporters by reminding them why they voted for Trump . ”
“ Polls show that the president ’ s campaign promise to appoint constitutionalist rather than activist judges , backed up by a list of 21 stellar potential nominees , was a big part of why he was elected , ” Mr. Levey said .
As Senate Republican leaders pick up the pace of confirmations , Democrats lost a tactic to throw up roadblocks to Mr. Trump ’ s nominees last week . Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley , Iowa Republican , said he will hold hearings on some nominees even if both home-state senators haven ’ t given their approval , a traditional courtesy known as the “ blue-slip ” process .
Mr. Grassley announced he would schedule a hearing for Nov. 29 for Minnesota Supreme Court Justice David Stras , nominated for the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals . Sen. Al Franken , Minnesota Democrat , had said in September that he would not return his blue slip for Judge Stras , saying the nominee “ would be a deeply conservative jurist in the mold of Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia . ”
Mr. Franken also found himself in a political furor last week when a Los Angeles radio personality accused him of sexual harassment before he was elected to the Senate . The lawmaker has apologized and said he welcomes an ethics investigation .
Mr. Grassley said that the blue slip tradition was not intended to give senators “ veto power ” over nominees .
The Judiciary Committee ’ s ranking Democrat , Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California , said Mr. Grassley ’ s decision “ couldn ’ t be more troubling . ”

The House has voted to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress over his failure to turn over documents related to the Fast and Furious scandal, the first time Congress has taken such a dramatic move against a sitting Cabinet official.

The vote was 255-67, with 17 Democrats voting in support of a criminal contempt resolution, which authorizes Republicans leaders to seek criminal charges against Holder. This Democratic support came despite a round of behind-the-scenes lobbying by senior White House and Justice officials - as well as pressure from party leaders - to support Holder.

Two Republicans, Reps. Steve LaTourette (Ohio) Scott Rigell (Va.), voted against the contempt resolution.

Another civil contempt resolution, giving the green light for the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to sue the Justice Department to get the Fast and Furious documents, passed by a 258-95 margin. Twenty-one Democrats voted for that measure.

But dozens of other Democrats marched off the floor in protest during the vote, adding even more drama to a tumultuous moment in the House chamber.

The heated House floor fight over Holder capped a historic day in Washington, coming just hours after the Supreme Court, just across the street from the Capitol, issued its landmark ruling upholding most of Barack Obama’s health care law. The passions of the day were evident inside the Capitol, where Democrats accused Republicans of ginning up the contempt vote for political purposes while Republicans continued to charge the Justice Department with a cover up on the Fast and Furious scandal.

The fight over the Holder contempt resolution also drew intense interest from outside groups ranging from the NAACP to the National Rifle Association.

In a statement released by his office, Holder blasted the contempt votes as “politically motivated” and “misguided,” and he singled out Rep. Darrell Issa (Calif.), chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee and lead Republican on the Fast and Furious probe, for special criticism.

“Today’s vote is the regrettable culmination of what became a misguided – and politically motivated – investigation during an election year,” Holder said in his statement. “By advancing it over the past year and a half, Congressman Issa and others have focused on politics over public safety.

Mccarthy, John Mccormack, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Mairead Mcardle, Robert Verbruggen, Carrie Severino, Tobias Hoonhout, Rich Lowry, John Fund","Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh testifies during the second day of his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington , D.C. , September 5 , 2018 . ( Joshua Roberts/Reuters )
If Ford won ’ t agree to testify , hold the vote tomorrow as planned .
In my column yesterday , I contended that the unverifiable sexual-assault allegation against Judge Brett Kavanaugh bore “ all the hallmarks of a set-up. ” I based that assessment on the patently flimsy evidence , coupled with Senate Democrats ’ duplicitous abuse of the confirmation-hearing process . To repeat myself :
If the Democrats had raised the allegation in a timely manner , its weakness would have been palpable , it would have been used for what little it ’ s worth in examining Kavanagh during his days of testimony , it would be put to rest as unverifiable , and we ’ d be on to a confirmation vote . Instead , we ’ re on to a delay — precisely the Democrats ’ objective . They want to slow-walk Kavanaugh ’ s confirmation vote until after the midterms , in the hopes that they swing the Senate in their favor and have the numbers to defeat the nomination .
Well , whaddaya know : Late last night , the partisan Democratic attorneys retained by the putative victim , Christine Blasey Ford , delivered a letter to Senator Chuck Grassley ( R. , Iowa ) , the Judiciary Committee chairman , contending that before any hearing at which she is summoned to testify takes place , there must be a “ full investigation by law enforcement officials [ to ] ensure that the crucial facts and witnesses in this matter are assessed in a non-partisan manner . ”
My personal favorite part of the missive is the lawyers ’ complaint that , based on published reports , it seems that some of the senators have already “ made up their minds ” about Professor Ford ’ s story . This takes some gumption , coming from Democratic activists who are working in tandem with Democratic senators who decided to vote against Judge Kavanaugh long before the hearing started . The lawyers utter this tripe while in the middle of a transparent gambit to block the nomination by delaying it interminably — or at least until after the November election .
The committee had invited Ford to testify at a hearing on Monday of next week ( September 24 ) . This was more solicitude than the allegation merits given the Democrats ’ willful abuse of the process . Ford should have been invited to submit her claims in writing , Kavanaugh could have been asked to respond , and the committee could have assessed the allegation — a 36-year-old alleged incident that the claimed victim , then 15 , did not mention for 30 years , can not fix in time and place , and claimed to want anonymity about , and which is flatly denied by the only other witnesses , Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge , then 17-year-old high-school students .
The committee could have weighed Ford ’ s allegation against the mountain of contrary information posited in favor of Kavanaugh ’ s character , and his treatment of women and girls , professionally and socially , over the last three dozen years . ( There is also , we might remember , the — apparently — small matter of the 300 appellate opinions Kavanaugh has penned since his appointment twelve years ago to one of the nation ’ s most distinguished courts . ) As in any formal proceeding ( other than a kangaroo court ) , the committee could also have considered that the partisans with the greatest incentive to publicize derogatory information about Kavanaugh — if they believed it to be true — instead sat on it , springing it at the last second in a palpable attempt to obstruct the committee ’ s vote on the nomination ( which they were certain to lose ) . The committee vote , scheduled for Thursday , could have gone forward .
Instead , the vote was delayed to provide Ford an opportunity to testify . This was wholly unnecessary under the circumstances , but the committee went the extra mile in order to exhibit sensitivity to Ford ’ s alleged trauma . Rather than accept , however , Ford ’ s partisan Democratic lawyers countered that there must be an investigation first — never mind that the committee hearing is an investigation of the only thing that matters : how the Senate should exercise its constitutional advice-and-consent duty .
First , in no case does even the most sympathetic , convincing victim of a crime get to dictate the terms of the investigation .
Second , in any sexual-assault investigation , an interview of the alleged victim is among the first things that must be done . Here , moreover , it would be the first thing , since after 36 years a forensic investigation is not possible . Because the alleged victim ’ s version of events would dictate the course of the rest of the investigation , it would be absurd to delay an interview .
Third , as long as Ford ’ s counsel want to talk about regular , independent investigations , we should note that there is not a police organization in America that would entertain her allegation , in light of the lapse of time and the long-ago exhaustion of the statute of limitations . Professional investigators understand only too well the inherent unreliability of allegations raised in the manner Ford ’ s have been raised . The only relevance of this alleged incident is to a Senate function , so it is for the Senate committee to decide how to proceed .
Fourth , as Ford ’ s lawyers well know , in our adversary system , we do not submit disputes to a team of independent expert investigators . We have advocates for each side — partisans — make the case as well as it can be made from their side ’ s perspective , and we let the other side attack with all its partisan might . We allow each side to examine the other ’ s witnesses . Based on this often heated clash , we expect that members of the public will be able to figure out what information is reliable , what is nonsense , and what the truth is . That is the process we use for deciding life-and-death criminal sentences , as well as civil judgments that can be financially ruinous . We have used it for centuries because it works .
It is fashionable throat-clearing at this point to offer some vertiginous , ostentatiously sympathetic twaddle about how Professor Ford is credible in the sense that she truly believes what she has claimed , yet mistaken about . . . well . . . everything that matters . Sorry , I ’ m a simple man . What ’ s happening here is pure BS .
I don ’ t know if something awful really happened to Ford when she was 15 . None of us will ever know . Apparently , Ford herself does not know basic facts either , since she can not tell us where and when the alleged assault happened , and what she did in the aftermath . Giving her the benefit of the doubt that it happened as she claims it happened , she hasn ’ t come close to establishing that Brett Kavanaugh , as opposed to some other kid she has forgotten , was her assailant ; that is , she has not established that her memory of the assailant can be trusted when she can not recall other rudimentary details . We can feel sympathy for her while nevertheless inferring that she does not want to testify because she can not explain the oddities of her account . Or we can justifiably suspect that the whole thing is a partisan stunt .
If Democrats had believed Ford ’ s story was convincing , and had followed the committee-hearing process in good faith , we ’ d have heard about it in July , and we ’ d have been hearing about nothing else since — especially during the hours upon hours that Kavanaugh answered aggressively provocative , politically loaded questions under oath . Senator Feinstein knew about Ford ’ s allegation all that time and never uttered a peep about it — not in face-to-face interviews with Kavanaugh or in her rounds of questioning at the hearing . And don ’ t tell me Feinstein had to stay mum to honor Ford ’ s desire for anonymity . There is good reason to believe Ford had no intention of remaining anonymous ( hiring Democrat-activist lawyers , taking a polygraph , etc. ) . But even if Ford truly wanted to remain unidentified , Senator Feinstein could easily have questioned Kavanaugh about the purported incident without mentioning Ford ’ s name . That would have preserved anonymity while adhering to the hearing process . Instead , the Democrats ’ ranking committee member contemptuously undermined the committee ’ s process , and now other Senate Democrats are following her lead .

If Ford won’t agree to testify, hold the vote tomorrow as planned.

In my column yesterday, I contended that the unverifiable sexual-assault allegation against Judge Brett Kavanaugh bore “all the hallmarks of a set-up.” I based that assessment on the patently flimsy evidence, coupled with Senate Democrats’ duplicitous abuse of the confirmation-hearing process. To repeat myself:

If the Democrats had raised the allegation in a timely manner, its weakness would have been palpable, it would have been used for what little it’s worth in examining Kavanagh during his days of testimony, it would be put to rest as unverifiable, and we’d be on to a confirmation vote. Instead, we’re on to a delay — precisely the Democrats’ objective. They want to slow-walk Kavanaugh’s confirmation vote until after the midterms, in the hopes that they swing the Senate in their favor and have the numbers to defeat the nomination.

Well, whaddaya know: Late last night, the partisan Democratic attorneys retained by the putative victim, Christine Blasey Ford, delivered a letter to Senator Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), the Judiciary Committee chairman, contending that before any hearing at which she is summoned to testify takes place, there must be a “full investigation by law enforcement officials [to] ensure that the crucial facts and witnesses in this matter are assessed in a non-partisan manner.”

My personal favorite part of the missive is the lawyers’ complaint that, based on published reports, it seems that some of the senators have already “made up their minds” about Professor Ford’s story. This takes some gumption, coming from Democratic activists who are working in tandem with Democratic senators who decided to vote against Judge Kavanaugh long before the hearing started. The lawyers utter this tripe while in the middle of a transparent gambit to block the nomination by delaying it interminably — or at least until after the November election.

What a crock.

The committee had invited Ford to testify at a hearing on Monday of next week (September 24). This was more solicitude than the allegation merits given the Democrats’ willful abuse of the process. Ford should have been invited to submit her claims in writing, Kavanaugh could have been asked to respond, and the committee could have assessed the allegation — a 36-year-old alleged incident that the claimed victim, then 15, did not mention for 30 years, cannot fix in time and place, and claimed to want anonymity about, and which is flatly denied by the only other witnesses, Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge, then 17-year-old high-school students.

The committee could have weighed Ford’s allegation against the mountain of contrary information posited in favor of Kavanaugh’s character, and his treatment of women and girls, professionally and socially, over the last three dozen years. (There is also, we might remember, the — apparently — small matter of the 300 appellate opinions Kavanaugh has penned since his appointment twelve years ago to one of the nation’s most distinguished courts.) As in any formal proceeding (other than a kangaroo court), the committee could also have considered that the partisans with the greatest incentive to publicize derogatory information about Kavanaugh — if they believed it to be true — instead sat on it, springing it at the last second in a palpable attempt to obstruct the committee’s vote on the nomination (which they were certain to lose). The committee vote, scheduled for Thursday, could have gone forward.

Instead, the vote was delayed to provide Ford an opportunity to testify. This was wholly unnecessary under the circumstances, but the committee went the extra mile in order to exhibit sensitivity to Ford’s alleged trauma. Rather than accept, however, Ford’s partisan Democratic lawyers countered that there must be an investigation first — never mind that the committee hearing is an investigation of the only thing that matters: how the Senate should exercise its constitutional advice-and-consent duty.

Four points, to state the obvious.

First, in no case does even the most sympathetic, convincing victim of a crime get to dictate the terms of the investigation.

Advertisement

Second, in any sexual-assault investigation, an interview of the alleged victim is among the first things that must be done. Here, moreover, it would be the first thing, since after 36 years a forensic investigation is not possible. Because the alleged victim’s version of events would dictate the course of the rest of the investigation, it would be absurd to delay an interview.

Third, as long as Ford’s counsel want to talk about regular, independent investigations, we should note that there is not a police organization in America that would entertain her allegation, in light of the lapse of time and the long-ago exhaustion of the statute of limitations. Professional investigators understand only too well the inherent unreliability of allegations raised in the manner Ford’s have been raised. The only relevance of this alleged incident is to a Senate function, so it is for the Senate committee to decide how to proceed.

Fourth, as Ford’s lawyers well know, in our adversary system, we do not submit disputes to a team of independent expert investigators. We have advocates for each side — partisans — make the case as well as it can be made from their side’s perspective, and we let the other side attack with all its partisan might. We allow each side to examine the other’s witnesses. Based on this often heated clash, we expect that members of the public will be able to figure out what information is reliable, what is nonsense, and what the truth is. That is the process we use for deciding life-and-death criminal sentences, as well as civil judgments that can be financially ruinous. We have used it for centuries because it works.

It is fashionable throat-clearing at this point to offer some vertiginous, ostentatiously sympathetic twaddle about how Professor Ford is credible in the sense that she truly believes what she has claimed, yet mistaken about . . . well . . . everything that matters. Sorry, I’m a simple man. What’s happening here is pure BS.

Advertisement

I don’t know if something awful really happened to Ford when she was 15. None of us will ever know. Apparently, Ford herself does not know basic facts either, since she cannot tell us where and when the alleged assault happened, and what she did in the aftermath. Giving her the benefit of the doubt that it happened as she claims it happened, she hasn’t come close to establishing that Brett Kavanaugh, as opposed to some other kid she has forgotten, was her assailant; that is, she has not established that her memory of the assailant can be trusted when she cannot recall other rudimentary details. We can feel sympathy for her while nevertheless inferring that she does not want to testify because she cannot explain the oddities of her account. Or we can justifiably suspect that the whole thing is a partisan stunt.

If Democrats had believed Ford’s story was convincing, and had followed the committee-hearing process in good faith, we’d have heard about it in July, and we’d have been hearing about nothing else since — especially during the hours upon hours that Kavanaugh answered aggressively provocative, politically loaded questions under oath. Senator Feinstein knew about Ford’s allegation all that time and never uttered a peep about it — not in face-to-face interviews with Kavanaugh or in her rounds of questioning at the hearing. And don’t tell me Feinstein had to stay mum to honor Ford’s desire for anonymity. There is good reason to believe Ford had no intention of remaining anonymous (hiring Democrat-activist lawyers, taking a polygraph, etc.). But even if Ford truly wanted to remain unidentified, Senator Feinstein could easily have questioned Kavanaugh about the purported incident without mentioning Ford’s name. That would have preserved anonymity while adhering to the hearing process. Instead, the Democrats’ ranking committee member contemptuously undermined the committee’s process, and now other Senate Democrats are following her lead.

When independent counsel Kenneth Starr was heading the investigation into President Bill Clinton , he hired Kavanaugh as an assistant .

Kavanaugh 's 12 years on the D.C . Circuit – longer than any recent Supreme Court nominee but Ginsburg , who served there 13 years – have included some controversial cases . Among them :
In 2011 , he dissented from an appeals court decision upholding the Affordable Care Act 's individual mandate . But rather than declare it unconstitutional , he wrote a 65-page dissent arguing that judges had no authority to decide the case . `` We ’ re courts of judicial restraint , '' he said during oral argument . `` It ’ s a delicate act to declare an act of Congress unconstitutional. ” That has caused some conservatives to liken him to Roberts , who saved Obamacare from extinction in a 5-4 ruling the following year .
During a hearing in 2016 on Obama 's `` clean power '' plan to combat global warming , he called the policy `` laudable '' but said it set unachievable limits that would drive plants out of business . `` Lots of people are going to lose their jobs , lose their livelihoods , '' he said . The plan never took effect .
Last year , he dissented from the appeals court 's ruling in favor of an undocumented teenage girl seeking an abortion . He cited Supreme Court precedents , under which he said that `` the government has permissible interests in favoring fetal life , protecting the best interests of a minor , and refraining from facilitating abortion .

Washington insider

When President Donald Trump put together his first and second lists of potential nominees last year, Kavanaugh's name was missing. The reason? He was a product of Washington, D.C., from the day he was born, and the renegade president wanted an outsider.

When independent counsel Kenneth Starr was heading the investigation into President Bill Clinton, he hired Kavanaugh as an assistant.

Controversial cases

Throughout the search for Trump's second Supreme Court nominee, Kavanaugh was a favorite of the conservative legal cognoscenti. They sought someone with a long track record that included most of the controversial issues likely to come before the high court.

WASHINGTON – Brett Kavanaugh will be on the Supreme Court in time to hear cases on immigration, product liability and the Armed Career Criminal Act.

Kavanaugh was sworn in Saturday by Chief Justice John Roberts and former associate justice Anthony Kennedy, for whom he clerked a quarter century ago. A White House ceremony will be held Monday, and the 53-year-old judge will take a seat on the far right side of the bench Tuesday, next to Associate Justice Elena Kagan, who hired him to teach at Harvard Law School when she was dean.

Although he will give the court its first reliable conservative majority in decades, the docket facing the justices in the term that began Monday isn't filled with the types of major cases that produce 5-4 rulings.

That said, the first week's cases that Kavanaugh missed featured some in which the justices did appear closely divided. The first case involved an endangered frog that liberal justices seemed intent on protecting, while their conservative colleagues sided with a corporation whose land might lose value as a result.

Before the week was out, a majority of the eight justices appeared sympathetic to a death row prisoner in Alabama whose severe dementia renders him incapable of remembering his crime. But they were again split on a Pennsylvania town's right to require public access to a recently discovered cemetery on private land.

Kavanaugh will not participate in deliberations on those cases, so one or more of them could emerge with a 4-4 tie. That result merely leaves a lower court's verdict intact, unless the court decides to rehear the case with Kavanaugh's participation.

Kavanaugh's first cases

Here's a look at the first cases Kavanaugh will hear:

• Tuesday will feature a 1984 federal law that has been before the Supreme Court often: the Armed Career Criminal Act, which sets a 15-year minimum sentence for crimes involving firearms if the offender has three prior serious or violent felony convictions. Questions arise continually regarding what crimes are ""serious"" or ""violent.""

• On Wednesday, the justices will consider another question they've heard before: which undocumented immigrants can be detained during deportation proceedings? The case involves an immigrant with a prior criminal record, but who no longer is in custody.

• Also Wednesday, the court will hear a case filed by Navy sailors seeking to recover damages for injuries caused by asbestos exposure. The companies being sued manufactured the equipment, but the asbestos was added later by companies that are now bankrupt.

The justices already are scheduled to consider whether police can gain access without a warrant to cellphone location data held by wireless service providers , so the addition of the Microsoft case makes this term a major one for the intersection of technology and the law .
The Microsoft case dates back to 2013 , when U.S. prosecutors demanded the Internet giant turn over emails linked to a drug-trafficking case . The emails were stored only on Microsoft servers in Ireland .

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court agreed Monday to hear another major case on digital privacy, this time pitting the federal government against Microsoft in a battle over emails held overseas.

The justices already are scheduled to consider whether police can gain access without a warrant to cellphone location data held by wireless service providers, so the addition of the Microsoft case makes this term a major one for the intersection of technology and the law.

The Microsoft case dates back to 2013, when U.S. prosecutors demanded the Internet giant turn over emails linked to a drug-trafficking case. The emails were stored only on Microsoft servers in Ireland.

Microsoft turned over information it had stored in the United States but sued to block the warrant, saying U.S. law enforcement couldn't seize evidence held in another country. It warned that if it was forced to do so, foreign governments could force U.S. companies to turn over evidence stored here.

Microsoft lost the first round in 2014 when U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska said the company had to hand over the emails. Then last year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in New York reversed and ruled in Microsoft's favor.

By agreeing to hear the case, the justices are taking on an issue they could have left alone, since there is no split among federal appeals courts. That's true in the cellphone location data case as well.

In addition, Congress is considering legislation that would fill in some blanks left by the Stored Communications Act of 1986, which did not address communications held overseas.

Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said the court should have waited for Congress to act.

“The current laws were written for the era of the floppy disk, not the world of the cloud,"" he said on his blog. ""We believe that rather than arguing over an old law in court, it is time for Congress to act by passing new legislation.""

But the Trump administration urged the high court to take on the case. ""Neither the absence of a circuit conflict nor the speculative possibility of eventual legislative action diminishes the acute and present need for this court’s review of a legally unsound

decision that is frustrating important investigations around the country,"" it said in legal papers.

Thirty-three states weighed in on the government's side, arguing in a brief submitted by Vermont that the appeals court decision ""is interfering with the ability of state and local law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute crime in their jurisdictions.""

""Email and other electronic communication services provided by companies like Microsoft, Google, Yahoo!, Facebook, and Twitter are ubiquitous in today’s world,"" the states argued. ""The companies that provide these services control their customers’ data and thus often possess evidence that state and local law enforcement agencies need to investigate and prosecute crimes in their jurisdictions.""

Microsoft argued that Congress is the proper forum to address the issue, noting that the Justice Department proposed a legislative fix before appealing the lower court ruling to the Supreme Court.

""Revising a federal statute to account for the globalization of data is a job for Congress, not courts,"" Microsoft told the justices.

The company warned that the nation's technology sector would be harmed ""if it becomes the conduit through which U.S. law enforcement can seize the private communications of every U.S. service provider’s customers, no matter where in the world those customers are located or their data is stored.""

A Sri Lankan migrant named Vijayakumar Thuraissigiam , who was apprehended just 25 yards from the southern border after entering the country illegally , is at the center of the case . The legal question was whether asylum seekers can seek habeas corpus , the basic right to have your detention reviewed by a judge , when they are fast-tracked for removal .
`` This ruling fails to live up to the Constitution 's bedrock principle that individuals deprived of their liberty have their day in court , and this includes asylum seekers , '' said ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt , who argued before the justices for Thuraissigiam . `` This decision means that some people facing flawed deportation orders can be forcibly removed with no judicial oversight , putting their lives in grave danger .

Thursday 's decision follows a Tuesday ruling from a federal appeals court that allowed the Trump administration to expand fast-track deportations . Taken together , the rulings are a boon to Trump 's efforts to speed the pace of deportations , burnishing his border hawk credentials ahead of the November election .
The bottom-line outcome was 7-2 . Justice Samuel Alito delivered the majority opinion , which the Court 's conservatives joined . Justices Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg agreed with the result but did not join the majority . Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented , joined by Justice Elena Kagan .
Thuraissigiam is a member of Sri Lanka 's Tamil minority , who face abuse by the Sri Lankan government according to human rights groups . In January 2017 , Thuraissigiam asked for asylum after he was intercepted entering the United States unlawfully . An immigration officer determined he did not have a `` credible fear '' of persecution and his superiors signed off , teeing up a quick deportation . Asylum seekers who fail the credible-fear test are placed in a speedy expulsion protocol called `` expedited removal . ''
A 1996 immigration law dictates that courts ca n't review a credible-fear determination . Immigration authorities get the final word . Nonetheless , Thuraissigiam went to a federal judge and asked for a second chance at his asylum interview , arguing he should have passed the credible-fear stage . The judge refused . But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit revived Thuraissigiam 's bid and ruled that the 1996 law violates the Constitution 's suspension clause , which forbids rescinding habeas corpus except in case of emergency .
The High Court reversed the Ninth Circuit 's ruling Thursday and said Thuraissigiam 's claim went well beyond the scope of habeas corpus as understood when the Constitution was adopted .
`` Habeas has traditionally been a means to secure release from unlawful detention , but [ Thuraissigiam ] invokes the writ to achieve an entirely different end , '' namely the right to stay in the United States and get a new credible-fear interview , Alito wrote .
`` Claims so far outside the core of habeas may not be pursued through habeas , '' he wrote elsewhere , citing earlier cases from 2008 and 2011 .
There was also a practical concern . Given that thousands of asylum seekers are placed in expedited removal , the government feared a ruling for Thuraissigiam would prompt a surge of habeas petitions in federal courts . That 's contrary to the design of the 1996 law , Alito said .
`` The potential for a flood would be , of course , far greater if this Court holds that there is a right to file a habeas-seeking review of a negative credible-fear determination , '' Justice Department lawyer Edwin Kneedler told the justices during oral arguments in March . By the Justice Department 's count , about 100 asylum seekers sought habeas following the Ninth Circuit 's decision in Thuraissigiam 's case , he said .
In a separate opinion , Breyer agreed that Thuraissigiam should lose , but said the Court should not go further and explore `` difficult questions '' touching deportations and the suspension clause .

The vote went against her moderate image , say critics , given Justice Kavanaugh ’ s own views and allegations against him of sexual assault . To Democrats it ’ s overshadowed Senator Collins ’ votes supporting “ Obamacare ” and her leadership in ending government shutdowns .
Some say that Senator Collins in recent years has become less attentive to local voters . But if there is one thing that has sparked her decline in popularity , particularly among women , it ’ s her deciding vote to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh .
“ I ’ m really disappointed . And you ’ ll hear that ’ s what the tenor is around here , ” says voter Cheryl Clukey of Augusta , Maine .
Susan Collins may be in trouble . For the first time in her career , the moderate Republican senator from Maine is facing sustained anger from a substantial number of voters at home . She ’ s dropped from the second most popular U.S. senator , as measured by polls , to the second most unpopular .
Despite being a Republican in a state that leans slightly Democratic , she has handily won every reelection since her entry to the Senate in 1996 . During her most recent race in 2014 , Senator Collins won every county in Maine by at least 24 percentage points . She ’ s frequently named the most bipartisan senator , and has long been a political icon in her state .
But her political position has changed . Senator Collins has gone from the country ’ s second-most popular senator , to the second-most unpopular in 2019 , right behind Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell . The Cook Political Report shifted its forecast of Senator Collins ’ race from “ lean Republican ” to “ toss-up ” in August .
In the age of President Donald Trump and the increasing political polarization of the Republican and Democratic parties , the national space for moderates like Senator Collins has shrunk . Senator Collins seemed to be one of the last leaders in Washington standing on a centrist island between the two parties , and Maine voters , who prize themselves on independent thinking , loved her for that . But in 2020 , there may no longer be enough land on the island for Senator Collins to stand .
“ I was always really proud of the idea that I could vote for two Republican women , ” says Emily Qualey , a Democrat from Portland , Maine , referring to Senator Collins and former Sen. Olympia Snowe . Ms. Qualey , who says she has voted for Senator Collins since she turned 18 , traveled to Washington on an overnight bus in October in hopes of meeting with Senator Collins about Judge Brett Kavanaugh . Since his confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court she has been active in a group raising funds for Senator Collins ’ Democratic opponent in 2020 .
Story Hinckley/The ███ Emily Qualey says she 's backed Sen. Susan Collins since she was eligible to vote , but the last few years have been a wakeup call . Sen. Collins has `` forgotten who she works for , '' says Ms. Qualey on September 4 , 2019 , in Portland Maine .
No longer can she vote for a GOP Senate candidate , she says . Among the reasons : the partisan split on “ Me Too ” and women ’ s stories of sexual harassment .
“ We are in such an incredible time when voices are being heard who haven ’ t been , ” says Ms. Qualey . “ Senator Collins should be using her experience to make the kind of difference the world needs right now . ”
The election is still more than a year away , and Senator Collins hasn ’ t announced that she is running . But if she does run , the 2020 race – projected to be the most expensive in Maine ’ s history – is shaping up to be her toughest yet . Senator Collins ’ seat is considered pivotal to Democrats ’ efforts to regain the Senate , and she will be on the Republican ticket with President Trump in a state that some pundits consider a swing state . At least four Democrats have announced challenges – challenges that , in past years , they might have considered futile .
“ When you ’ re a thoughtful moderate , it ’ s rare that 100 % of the people are going to agree with you 100 % of the time , ” says Kevin Kelley , a Collins campaign spokesman . “ But what Mainers appreciate about Senator Collins is that even when they may not agree with her decision , they know that she took the time to study the facts , and votes with integrity . ”
Voters that aren ’ t registered as Democrats or Republicans are the largest voting bloc in Maine , and much of Senator Collins ’ past success as a Republican has hinged on attracting these independents , as well as moderate Democrats . But after at least two dozen interviews with female Democrats and independent voters across Maine , it ’ s clear that the senator would face unprecedented headwinds to maintain her seat . While they say they ’ ve always voted for Senator Collins in the past , these interviewees say 2020 might be the first election they choose not to support the four-term incumbent .
“ I ’ ll have to think really hard if I ’ m going to vote for her again , ” says Cheryl Clukey while soaking up the last of the summer sun with her friend along the Kennebec River in Hallowell . “ I ’ m really disappointed . And you ’ ll hear that ’ s what the tenor is around here . ”
They say a small flame of frustration with Senator Collins has been burning over the past few years . Some accuse her of a shrinking schedule of town halls and local events . Others say they ’ ve written the senator too many unanswered letters or left too many unanswered voicemails . A few pin it to particular events such as her vote to confirm former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions , or her vote for President Trump ’ s tax overhaul .
But one event in particular , they say , fanned the flame into a fire .
“ Kavanaugh was the straw that broke the camel ’ s back , ” says Ms. Clukey .
Almost one year after Senator Collins cast the deciding vote to confirm Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh , her vote has remained fixed in Vacationland ’ s collective consciousness . In a political climate where a typical news story lingers for a median of seven days , and during a presidential administration that has almost weekly crises , it ’ s somewhat surprising that Mainers ’ resentment over Justice Kavanaugh has persisted one year later .
It could be because resentment over Justice Kavanaugh has persisted nationally , too . Just this Sunday , Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Elizabeth Warren , Sen. Kamala Harris , Sen. Bernie Sanders , and former housing secretary Julian Castro called for Justice Kavanaugh ’ s impeachment , following a published excerpt from an upcoming book by two New York Times reporters who investigated allegations of sexual misconduct against the justice as a college student .
“ Like the man who appointed him , Kavanaugh should be impeached , ” Senator Warren tweeted Sunday afternoon .
But female moderates say Senator Collins ’ vote on Justice Kavanaugh has stuck with them not only because of its definitive nature , but also because it so clearly went against what they wanted as constituents and against what she has represented as a leader .
Senator Collins has branded herself as a vocal pro-choice Republican woman and fair representative , calling balls and strikes as she sees them – not how party lines dictate . So they say it feels contradictory for her to endorse a man who has acknowledged that the Supreme Court “ can always overrule ” Roe v. Wade , and been confronted with several allegations of sexual misconduct himself .
“ It ’ s like if the lady who wrote the book on etiquette went to dinner and didn ’ t use a napkin , ” says Amy Dyer , assistant manager of Frosty ’ s doughnuts in Gardiner . Ms. Dyer interrupts herself to tell a customer that , unfortunately , Frosty ’ s has run out of their popular Boston cremes , before adding : “ We were shocked . ”
Story Hinckley/The ███ Amy Dyer , assistant manager of Frosty 's Donuts in Gardiner , Maine , says she 's always liked Sen. Collins , but she does n't think Sen. Collins will win reelection in 2020 on Sept 5 , 2019 .
Senator Collins ’ vote was surprising , say many women , because they have seen the senator make tough calls in the past and they were optimistic that she would do so again . Mainers point to her leadership in ending the 2014 government shutdown , her votes against the confirmation of Department of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos , the GOP repeal of the Affordable Care Act , and the military ’ s ban on openly LGBTQ people , or her vocal decision not to vote for President Trump , as evidence that she might once again challenge today ’ s partisanship .
“ I was holding onto a glimmer of hope that [ Senator Collins ] was going to surprise us all by putting herself on the line , for the benefit of the many , ” says Ms. Qualey .
“ I ’ m an optimist and I ’ ve seen Collins support women , ” says Pam Maus , a documentary filmmaker who lives in Owls Head , and says she has voted for Senator Collins in the past . “ Leading up to 2016 she came out with her disdain for Trump and I was encouraged . I was like , ‘ This is the Susan Collins I know . ’ ”
But like Ms. Qualey and Ms. Clukey , Ms. Maus says the vote for Justice Kavanaugh was “ the last straw. ” Ms. Maus has since done some canvassing for the Democratic Party , and says she ’ s heard from dozens of Mainers who have supported Senator Collins in the past , but plan on voting for her opponent in 2020 .
Ahead of her vote last Oct. 6 , Senator Collins gave a nearly hour-long speech , announcing that she would vote to confirm Justice Kavanaugh despite her “ reservations. ” As a judge , Justice Kavanaugh has respected legal precedent in regards to two Supreme Court cases that legalized abortion , she explained . And although Christine Blasey Ford ’ s testimony was “ sincere , painful , and compelling , ” the lack of corroborating evidence raised questions .
It ’ s likely that Senator Collins would be criticized whichever way she voted on Justice Kavanaugh . It ’ s also likely that Sen. Collins , who wields considerable power in a divided Senate , was going to be criticized for difficult decisions in today ’ s Washington even without the confirmation of a contentious Supreme Court justice .
Now , as Maine Democrats and independents feel increasingly scared and angry under the Trump administration , they may have less patience for a moderate leader . In their eyes her brand of moderation is abetting presidential extremism .
“ To us , she is out of step with what we want . We want a leader who speaks out. ” says Marie Follayttar , director of the political action committee Mainers for Accountable Leadership , from a coffee shop in Portland .
Following Justice Kavanaugh ’ s nomination by President Trump last year , Ms. Follayttar helped organize protest rallies around the state . She also collected at least 3,000 handwritten notes from Mainers pleading with the senator to vote against Justice Kavanaugh , many of which she has posted on the Facebook page , “ Mainers writing Collins. ” Many of the women , including Ms. Follayttar , included their own stories of sexual assault . They also debuted a video , “ Senator Collins : Be a Hero , ” in which female Mainers pledged to unseat her if she voted in favor of Justice Kavanaugh .
To date , Mainers for Accountable Leadership and other local groups have raised more than $ 4 million in donations for whoever wins the Democratic primary to challenge Senator Collins next November .
Many Maine women , including Ms. Follayttar , say it ’ s not just the fact that Senator Collins voted for Justice Kavanaugh . Their frustration , anger , and disappointment also stem from how she went about it . They say she didn ’ t take the time to hear from voters , like their other senator , Angus King , did . They say they found her speech on the Senate floor dismissive and patronizing .
“ At many points there were opportunities for her to be a better leader , ” says Ms. Follayttar . “ I would have been disappointed in her regardless . ... But would the reaction have been so visceral ? I don ’ t know . ”
Mark Brewer , a political science professor at the University of Maine in Orono , says the race will likely be a tough one . After all , Senator Collins is still a four-term incumbent with substantial campaign funds already on hand , backed by a national party that sees her seat as pivotal to keeping control of the Senate . And Maine Republicans who may have been frustrated with the senator ’ s centrism before Justice Kavanaugh ’ s confirmation , adds Mr . Brewer , have likely solidified their support just as Democrats have solidified opposition . He says the race will likely come down to independents – the majority of Maine ’ s voting bloc .
“ She has a tough race on her hands , ” says Mr . Brewer . “ The question I think the senator is asking , and potential democratic challengers are asking , is what percentage of those unenrolled independent voters , who say they have voted for Collins in the past , how many of them will really turn away from her and vote for her opponent in 2020 ? ”
In front of a small , standing-room only crowd in Bangor , Betsy Sweet twists a fake knife into her stomach .
“ When Susan Collins voted for Kavanaugh , it felt like this , ” says Ms. Sweet , as the crowd nods in agreement . A longtime progressive activist in Maine who most recently ran in the Democratic primary for governor in 2018 , Ms. Sweet is running for the Democratic nomination to unseat Senator Collins .
“ It was clear she has become the senator of Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump , not the senator of Maine , ” says Ms. Sweet , as a few men in the back of the small storefront let out a whoop . “ The path to beat Susan Collins next year is narrow , but it ’ s possible . ”
At least three other Democrats besides Ms. Sweet have announced campaigns for the Senate seat , including the presumed favorite , Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives Sara Gideon . Ms. Gideon has already received the endorsements of groups such as Emily ’ s List , NARAL Pro-Choice America , and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee .
The Collins campaign says that Democratic challengers in the past have pushed the notion that women were set to abandon her . Opponents in 2008 and 2014 ran television ads in which female Maine voters said that in the upcoming election they would turn their back on Susan Collins . Both times the senator handily won reelection . “ If you have watched the videos , you see that this is a pattern , ” says Mr. Kelley .
A Gravis poll from June gave Senator Collins a 14-point lead over Ms. Gideon . It ’ s a considerable lead , but also considerably less than Senator Collins ’ final tally in the 2014 race , which she won by 37 points .

“ I actually feel bad for her , ” says Ms. Maus . “ I think she ’ s in over her head in toeing the Republican line . She used to be respected for being a moderate and now she doesn ’ t know how to maneuver . ”
This story has been updated to better characterize some of those interviewed .","“To us, she is out of step with what we want,” says Marie Follayter, director of the political group Mainers for Accountable Leadership.

The vote went against her moderate image, say critics, given Justice Kavanaugh’s own views and allegations against him of sexual assault. To Democrats it’s overshadowed Senator Collins’ votes supporting “Obamacare” and her leadership in ending government shutdowns.

Some say that Senator Collins in recent years has become less attentive to local voters. But if there is one thing that has sparked her decline in popularity, particularly among women, it’s her deciding vote to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

While they say they’ve always voted for Senator Collins in the past, these interviewees say 2020 might be the first election they choose not to support the four-term incumbent.

“I’ll have to think really hard if I’m going to vote for her again,” says Cheryl Clukey while soaking up the last of the summer sun with her friend along the Kennebec River in Hallowell. “I’m really disappointed. And you’ll hear that’s what the tenor is around here.”

They say a small flame of frustration with Senator Collins has been burning over the past few years. Some accuse her of a shrinking schedule of town halls and local events. Others say they’ve written the senator too many unanswered letters or left too many unanswered voicemails. A few pin it to particular events such as her vote to confirm former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, or her vote for President Trump’s tax overhaul.

But one event in particular, they say, fanned the flame into a fire.

“Kavanaugh was the straw that broke the camel’s back,” says Ms. Clukey.

Almost one year after Senator Collins cast the deciding vote to confirm Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh, her vote has remained fixed in Vacationland’s collective consciousness. In a political climate where a typical news story lingers for a median of seven days, and during a presidential administration that has almost weekly crises, it’s somewhat surprising that Mainers’ resentment over Justice Kavanaugh has persisted one year later.

It could be because resentment over Justice Kavanaugh has persisted nationally, too. Just this Sunday, Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Sen. Kamala Harris, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and former housing secretary Julian Castro called for Justice Kavanaugh’s impeachment, following a published excerpt from an upcoming book by two New York Times reporters who investigated allegations of sexual misconduct against the justice as a college student.

“Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached,” Senator Warren tweeted Sunday afternoon.

But female moderates say Senator Collins’ vote on Justice Kavanaugh has stuck with them not only because of its definitive nature, but also because it so clearly went against what they wanted as constituents and against what she has represented as a leader.

Senator Collins has branded herself as a vocal pro-choice Republican woman and fair representative, calling balls and strikes as she sees them – not how party lines dictate. So they say it feels contradictory for her to endorse a man who has acknowledged that the Supreme Court “can always overrule” Roe v. Wade, and been confronted with several allegations of sexual misconduct himself.

“It’s like if the lady who wrote the book on etiquette went to dinner and didn’t use a napkin,” says Amy Dyer, assistant manager of Frosty’s doughnuts in Gardiner. Ms. Dyer interrupts herself to tell a customer that, unfortunately, Frosty’s has run out of their popular Boston cremes, before adding: “We were shocked.”

Story Hinckley/The Christian Science Monitor Amy Dyer, assistant manager of Frosty's Donuts in Gardiner, Maine, says she's always liked Sen. Collins, but she doesn't think Sen. Collins will win reelection in 2020 on Sept 5, 2019.

Senator Collins’ vote was surprising, say many women, because they have seen the senator make tough calls in the past and they were optimistic that she would do so again. Mainers point to her leadership in ending the 2014 government shutdown, her votes against the confirmation of Department of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, the GOP repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and the military’s ban on openly LGBTQ people, or her vocal decision not to vote for President Trump, as evidence that she might once again challenge today’s partisanship.

“I was holding onto a glimmer of hope that [Senator Collins] was going to surprise us all by putting herself on the line, for the benefit of the many,” says Ms. Qualey.

“I’m an optimist and I’ve seen Collins support women,” says Pam Maus, a documentary filmmaker who lives in Owls Head, and says she has voted for Senator Collins in the past. “Leading up to 2016 she came out with her disdain for Trump and I was encouraged. I was like, ‘This is the Susan Collins I know.’”

But like Ms. Qualey and Ms. Clukey, Ms. Maus says the vote for Justice Kavanaugh was “the last straw.” Ms. Maus has since done some canvassing for the Democratic Party, and says she’s heard from dozens of Mainers who have supported Senator Collins in the past, but plan on voting for her opponent in 2020.

Less patience for a moderate leader

Ahead of her vote last Oct. 6, Senator Collins gave a nearly hour-long speech, announcing that she would vote to confirm Justice Kavanaugh despite her “reservations.” As a judge, Justice Kavanaugh has respected legal precedent in regards to two Supreme Court cases that legalized abortion, she explained. And although Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony was “sincere, painful, and compelling,” the lack of corroborating evidence raised questions.

It’s likely that Senator Collins would be criticized whichever way she voted on Justice Kavanaugh. It’s also likely that Sen. Collins, who wields considerable power in a divided Senate, was going to be criticized for difficult decisions in today’s Washington even without the confirmation of a contentious Supreme Court justice.

Now, as Maine Democrats and independents feel increasingly scared and angry under the Trump administration, they may have less patience for a moderate leader. In their eyes her brand of moderation is abetting presidential extremism.

“To us, she is out of step with what we want. We want a leader who speaks out.” says Marie Follayttar, director of the political action committee Mainers for Accountable Leadership, from a coffee shop in Portland.

Following Justice Kavanaugh’s nomination by President Trump last year, Ms. Follayttar helped organize protest rallies around the state. She also collected at least 3,000 handwritten notes from Mainers pleading with the senator to vote against Justice Kavanaugh, many of which she has posted on the Facebook page, “Mainers writing Collins.” Many of the women, including Ms. Follayttar, included their own stories of sexual assault. They also debuted a video, “Senator Collins: Be a Hero,” in which female Mainers pledged to unseat her if she voted in favor of Justice Kavanaugh.

To date, Mainers for Accountable Leadership and other local groups have raised more than $4 million in donations for whoever wins the Democratic primary to challenge Senator Collins next November.

Many Maine women, including Ms. Follayttar, say it’s not just the fact that Senator Collins voted for Justice Kavanaugh. Their frustration, anger, and disappointment also stem from how she went about it. They say she didn’t take the time to hear from voters, like their other senator, Angus King, did. They say they found her speech on the Senate floor dismissive and patronizing.

“At many points there were opportunities for her to be a better leader,” says Ms. Follayttar. “I would have been disappointed in her regardless. ... But would the reaction have been so visceral? I don’t know.”

Mark Brewer, a political science professor at the University of Maine in Orono, says the race will likely be a tough one. After all, Senator Collins is still a four-term incumbent with substantial campaign funds already on hand, backed by a national party that sees her seat as pivotal to keeping control of the Senate. And Maine Republicans who may have been frustrated with the senator’s centrism before Justice Kavanaugh’s confirmation, adds Mr. Brewer, have likely solidified their support just as Democrats have solidified opposition. He says the race will likely come down to independents – the majority of Maine’s voting bloc.

“She has a tough race on her hands,” says Mr. Brewer. “The question I think the senator is asking, and potential democratic challengers are asking, is what percentage of those unenrolled independent voters, who say they have voted for Collins in the past, how many of them will really turn away from her and vote for her opponent in 2020?”

“I actually feel bad for her”

In front of a small, standing-room only crowd in Bangor, Betsy Sweet twists a fake knife into her stomach.

“When Susan Collins voted for Kavanaugh, it felt like this,” says Ms. Sweet, as the crowd nods in agreement. A longtime progressive activist in Maine who most recently ran in the Democratic primary for governor in 2018, Ms. Sweet is running for the Democratic nomination to unseat Senator Collins.

“It was clear she has become the senator of Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump, not the senator of Maine,” says Ms. Sweet, as a few men in the back of the small storefront let out a whoop. “The path to beat Susan Collins next year is narrow, but it’s possible.”

At least three other Democrats besides Ms. Sweet have announced campaigns for the Senate seat, including the presumed favorite, Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives Sara Gideon. Ms. Gideon has already received the endorsements of groups such as Emily’s List, NARAL Pro-Choice America, and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.

The Collins campaign says that Democratic challengers in the past have pushed the notion that women were set to abandon her. Opponents in 2008 and 2014 ran television ads in which female Maine voters said that in the upcoming election they would turn their back on Susan Collins. Both times the senator handily won reelection. “If you have watched the videos, you see that this is a pattern,” says Mr. Kelley.

A Gravis poll from June gave Senator Collins a 14-point lead over Ms. Gideon. It’s a considerable lead, but also considerably less than Senator Collins’ final tally in the 2014 race, which she won by 37 points.

“I actually feel bad for her,” says Ms. Maus. “I think she’s in over her head in toeing the Republican line. She used to be respected for being a moderate and now she doesn’t know how to maneuver.”

supreme_court,CNN (Web News),0,http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/24/politics/john-roberts-supreme-court-gay-marriage/index.html,Will Chief Justice John Roberts anger conservatives?,2015-04-24,Ariane De Vogue,"Washington ( CNN ) Chief Justice John Roberts is back in the spotlight .
Roberts -- who shocked conservatives nearly three years ago by providing a pivotal vote to uphold Obamacare -- once again faces a judicial crossroads in a historic case .
The U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments Tuesday in a case that could decide whether gay and lesbian couples nationwide have the constitutional right to marry . The question at the core of Obergefell v. Hodges is one of the most consequential debates of the early 21st century , and one that is already helping to shape the 2016 presidential race .
Appeals courts nationwide have moved decisively toward supporting same-sex marriage , but a split at the appellate level helped propel the issue to the nation 's highest court , led by Roberts .
Appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush , Roberts has a solid conservative record and would seem an unlikely vote to support a constitutional right to same-sex marriage . He dissented in United States v. Windsor , a landmark case in which a narrowly divided court struck down a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act , which denied federal benefits to lawfully married same-sex couples . And he 's expressed sympathy with legal arguments that would allow same-sex marriage bans .
Yet both sides see the case as a legacy-making moment for the 60-year-old chief justice , and advocates for same-sex couples hold out hope that he will emerge as their ally . They will be scrutinizing his words and actions Tuesday for clues about how he 'll vote -- and whether he will upset some conservatives once again .
`` If the Windsor majority votes in favor of marriage equality , the ruling will be one of the most momentous decisions of the Roberts court , '' said Judith E. Schaeffer of the Constitutional Accountability Center , which is advocating for same-sex marriage . `` Will John Roberts want to be remembered as having dissented from such a historic decision ? ''
For some conservatives , a vote in favor of same-sex marriage in the case would be a huge disappointment . It would be akin to the type of betrayal they felt when Justice David Souter , who was nominated to the bench by George H.W . Bush and who retired in 2009 , consistently voted with the liberals or when Justice Anthony Kennedy , a Ronald Reagan appointee , disappointed them on earlier gay rights cases as well as abortion and the death penalty . Or when Roberts infuriated conservative allies by providing the crucial fifth vote to uphold Obamacare on the grounds that the law is a constitutional use of the government 's taxing authority .
The hope in conservative circles is that Roberts will see his legacy as ensuring that the issue of same-sex marriage gets decided by the people , not the courts .
`` The chief surely knows that his job is to be on the right side of the Constitution , '' said Edward Whelan , president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center . `` Blatherings about the 'wrong side of history ' are an appeal to intellectual cowardice . ''
Those hoping that he will vote to uphold the state bans see a strong signal in the Windsor case .
In his majority opinion , Kennedy said the `` principal purpose '' of the Defense of Marriage Act was to `` impose inequality . ''
Roberts disagreed . He wrote separately to say he thought Congress acted constitutionally when it passed the law in 1996 in an attempt to provide `` uniformity and stability '' at a time when every state defined marriage as between a man and a woman .
Roberts picked up on Kennedy 's language that emphasized the states ' power to define the marital relationship and said that power will someday `` come into play on the other side of the board in future cases about the constitutionality of state marriage definitions . ''
David Cruz of the University of Southern California Gould School of Law said that Roberts could use that reasoning to vote in favor of state bans in the Obergefell case .
`` Roberts is suggesting that concerns about the powers of states will support state laws excluding same-sex couples from marriage , '' Cruz said .
Indeed , the lower court that upheld the marriage bans in Michigan , Tennessee , Ohio and Kentucky in the Obergefell case relied heavily on the argument that states have a right to define marriage .
Another clue to Roberts ' thinking in the Windsor dissent is that he took particular issue with any notion that the Defense of Marriage Act was passed out of a desire to harm -- noting it had the support of majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate as well as President Bill Clinton , who signed it into law .
`` I would not tar the political branches with the brush of bigotry , '' Roberts wrote .
The comments suggest he would reject an argument in the Obergefell case that rested on the idea that same-sex marriage bans reflected animus against gay people .
But backers of same-sex marriage are reading some tea leaves of their own .
Schaeffer points out that Roberts did n't join the parts of the dissents penned by Justices Antonin Scalia Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito , which clearly stated a belief that state bans on same-sex marriage do n't violate the Constitution .
`` Roberts did n't join them in expressing those views , '' Schaeffer said .
At the time , Roberts simply wrote that the court `` does not have before it , and the logic of its opinion does not decide '' whether states can ban same-sex marriage .
Schaeffer said the chief justice could have simply chosen to remain silent on an issue that was n't before the court .
`` But I think one reasonable explanation is that Roberts was preserving a clean slate for himself on the ultimate issue of marriage equality , '' she said .
The Defense of Marriage Act decision overshadowed another 2013 case -- Hollingsworth v. Perry -- that could have determined whether states could ban same-sex marriage .
The case concerned a challenge to California 's Proposition 8 , a state constitutional amendment that barred same-sex couples from marriage . But Roberts , writing for the majority , dismissed the case , holding that the challengers did not have the legal standing to bring it to the court .
The ruling left in place a lower court decision that had invalidated Proposition 8 and thus paved the way for same-sex marriage in California . Roberts ' lesbian cousin , who lives in California , sat in the courtroom during arguments in the Prop 8 case .
Few people predicted that the issue would return so quickly to the Supreme Court , but waves of lower court judges -- sometimes citing Windsor -- struck down the state bans .
On the first day of the term last fall , the court was presented with seven different petitions on the issue . Conventional wisdom was that the justices would garner the four necessary votes and grant one of the cases . But conventional wisdom was completely wrong .
Without comment , the court declined to take up any of the cases , clearing the way for thousands of additional same-sex marriages .
The court 's vote count in such decisions is kept a secret and may never be known . But some speculate on one possible scenario : Roberts chose not to provide the fourth vote to the conservatives who dissented in Windsor .
Then again , even if the speculation were true , it does n't reveal much about Roberts ' thinking . There 's a big difference between voting not to take up a case , which expresses no opinions on the merits , and issuing an opinion on the merits .
And even when Roberts ' actions -- such as effectively allowing same-sex marriage to proceed in California -- seem to suggest a willingness to consider such unions nationwide , his comments along the way make it much harder to gain insight into his ultimate thinking .
`` When the institution of marriage developed historically , people did n't get around and say , 'Let 's have this institution , but let 's keep out homosexuals , ' `` Roberts said during the Proposition 8 oral arguments . `` The institution developed to serve purposes that , by their nature , did n't include homosexual couples . ''","Washington (CNN) Chief Justice John Roberts is back in the spotlight.

The U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments Tuesday in a case that could decide whether gay and lesbian couples nationwide have the constitutional right to marry. The question at the core of Obergefell v. Hodges is one of the most consequential debates of the early 21st century, and one that is already helping to shape the 2016 presidential race.

Appeals courts nationwide have moved decisively toward supporting same-sex marriage, but a split at the appellate level helped propel the issue to the nation's highest court, led by Roberts.

Appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush, Roberts has a solid conservative record and would seem an unlikely vote to support a constitutional right to same-sex marriage . He dissented in United States v. Windsor, a landmark case in which a narrowly divided court struck down a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act, which denied federal benefits to lawfully married same-sex couples. And he's expressed sympathy with legal arguments that would allow same-sex marriage bans.

Legacy

Yet both sides see the case as a legacy-making moment for the 60-year-old chief justice, and advocates for same-sex couples hold out hope that he will emerge as their ally. They will be scrutinizing his words and actions Tuesday for clues about how he'll vote -- and whether he will upset some conservatives once again.

""If the Windsor majority votes in favor of marriage equality, the ruling will be one of the most momentous decisions of the Roberts court,"" said Judith E. Schaeffer of the Constitutional Accountability Center , which is advocating for same-sex marriage. ""Will John Roberts want to be remembered as having dissented from such a historic decision?""

For some conservatives, a vote in favor of same-sex marriage in the case would be a huge disappointment. It would be akin to the type of betrayal they felt when Justice David Souter, who was nominated to the bench by George H.W. Bush and who retired in 2009, consistently voted with the liberals or when Justice Anthony Kennedy, a Ronald Reagan appointee, disappointed them on earlier gay rights cases as well as abortion and the death penalty. Or when Roberts infuriated conservative allies by providing the crucial fifth vote to uphold Obamacare on the grounds that the law is a constitutional use of the government's taxing authority.

The hope in conservative circles is that Roberts will see his legacy as ensuring that the issue of same-sex marriage gets decided by the people, not the courts.

""The chief surely knows that his job is to be on the right side of the Constitution,"" said Edward Whelan, president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center . ""Blatherings about the 'wrong side of history' are an appeal to intellectual cowardice.""

Dissent in Windsor

Those hoping that he will vote to uphold the state bans see a strong signal in the Windsor case.

In his majority opinion, Kennedy said the ""principal purpose"" of the Defense of Marriage Act was to ""impose inequality.""

Roberts disagreed. He wrote separately to say he thought Congress acted constitutionally when it passed the law in 1996 in an attempt to provide ""uniformity and stability"" at a time when every state defined marriage as between a man and a woman.

Roberts picked up on Kennedy's language that emphasized the states' power to define the marital relationship and said that power will someday ""come into play on the other side of the board in future cases about the constitutionality of state marriage definitions.""

David Cruz of the University of Southern California Gould School of Law said that Roberts could use that reasoning to vote in favor of state bans in the Obergefell case.

""Roberts is suggesting that concerns about the powers of states will support state laws excluding same-sex couples from marriage,"" Cruz said.

Indeed, the lower court that upheld the marriage bans in Michigan, Tennessee, Ohio and Kentucky in the Obergefell case relied heavily on the argument that states have a right to define marriage.

Another clue to Roberts' thinking in the Windsor dissent is that he took particular issue with any notion that the Defense of Marriage Act was passed out of a desire to harm -- noting it had the support of majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate as well as President Bill Clinton, who signed it into law.

""I would not tar the political branches with the brush of bigotry,"" Roberts wrote.

The comments suggest he would reject an argument in the Obergefell case that rested on the idea that same-sex marriage bans reflected animus against gay people.

But backers of same-sex marriage are reading some tea leaves of their own.

Schaeffer points out that Roberts didn't join the parts of the dissents penned by Justices Antonin Scalia Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito , which clearly stated a belief that state bans on same-sex marriage don't violate the Constitution.

""Roberts didn't join them in expressing those views,"" Schaeffer said.

At the time, Roberts simply wrote that the court ""does not have before it, and the logic of its opinion does not decide"" whether states can ban same-sex marriage.

Schaeffer said the chief justice could have simply chosen to remain silent on an issue that wasn't before the court.

""But I think one reasonable explanation is that Roberts was preserving a clean slate for himself on the ultimate issue of marriage equality,"" she said.

'Clean slate'

The Defense of Marriage Act decision overshadowed another 2013 case -- Hollingsworth v. Perry -- that could have determined whether states could ban same-sex marriage.

The case concerned a challenge to California's Proposition 8, a state constitutional amendment that barred same-sex couples from marriage. But Roberts, writing for the majority, dismissed the case, holding that the challengers did not have the legal standing to bring it to the court.

The ruling left in place a lower court decision that had invalidated Proposition 8 and thus paved the way for same-sex marriage in California. Roberts' lesbian cousin, who lives in California, sat in the courtroom during arguments in the Prop 8 case.

Few people predicted that the issue would return so quickly to the Supreme Court, but waves of lower court judges -- sometimes citing Windsor -- struck down the state bans.

On the first day of the term last fall, the court was presented with seven different petitions on the issue. Conventional wisdom was that the justices would garner the four necessary votes and grant one of the cases. But conventional wisdom was completely wrong.

Without comment, the court declined to take up any of the cases, clearing the way for thousands of additional same-sex marriages.

The court's vote count in such decisions is kept a secret and may never be known. But some speculate on one possible scenario: Roberts chose not to provide the fourth vote to the conservatives who dissented in Windsor.

Then again, even if the speculation were true, it doesn't reveal much about Roberts' thinking. There's a big difference between voting not to take up a case, which expresses no opinions on the merits, and issuing an opinion on the merits.

And even when Roberts' actions -- such as effectively allowing same-sex marriage to proceed in California -- seem to suggest a willingness to consider such unions nationwide, his comments along the way make it much harder to gain insight into his ultimate thinking.

""When the institution of marriage developed historically, people didn't get around and say, 'Let's have this institution, but let's keep out homosexuals,' "" Roberts said during the Proposition 8 oral arguments. ""The institution developed to serve purposes that, by their nature, didn't include homosexual couples.""",www.cnn.com,left,NfaaUhqI1eHYp88C

The drastically conflicting statements , delivered to the Senate Judiciary Committee in dramatic testimony that carried echoes of the 1991 Anita Hill hearings , left senators to make a judgment call on whose story is accurate . Kavanaugh 's confirmation process was thrown into chaos by the 11th-hour charges , and it remains unclear whether the hearing will sway enough senators to secure confirmation .
Kavanaugh let loose in his hearing appearance , abandoning much of his prepared remarks to blast the process as a `` disgrace '' and a `` circus , '' and later sparring with Democratic senators . The hearing ended Thursday evening after eight hours worth of testimony from Ford and Kavanaugh .
`` This confirmation process has become a national disgrace , '' Kavanaugh told the committee . `` The Constitution gives the Senate an important role in the confirmation process . But you have replaced advise and consent with search and destroy . ''
Earlier in the same hearing room , Ford appeared in public for the first time to testify on her allegations and told lawmakers in no uncertain terms that the Supreme Court nominee `` sexually assaulted me . '' She insisted she was not mistaking him for another person .
`` Brett 's assault on me drastically altered my life , '' Ford told the committee .
But Kavanaugh described the allegations , from Ford and others , as part of a calculated political hit deployed by Democrats when he was getting too close to confirmation .
`` I am innocent of this charge , '' he said repeatedly . Kavanaugh told senators he has `` categorically and unequivocally '' denied the allegations since they first aired .
He described the toll taken by those charges , especially others that emerged in recent days : `` My family and my name have been totally and permanently destroyed by vicious and false additional accusations . ''
As the hearing continued into the late afternoon , the proceedings got more heated . In one tense exchange , Sen. Dick Durbin , D-Ill. , repeatedly asked Kavanaugh to support a FBI investigation . `` If there is no truth to the charges , the FBI investigation will show that , '' Durbin said . `` Are you afraid that they might not ? ''
After Durbin 's comments , a fired-up Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , lashed out at the Democrats . `` This is the most unethical sham since I have been in politics , '' Graham said , raising his voice at the Democrats . `` And if you really wanted to know the truth , you sure as hell would n't have done what you have done to this guy . ''
At another point , Sen. John Cornyn , R-Texas , told Kavanaugh , `` Judge , I ca n't think of a more embarrassing scandal for the United States Senate since the McCarthy hearings . ''
When Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse repeatedly pressed Kavanaugh about alcohol , the nominee shot back : `` I like beer . I do n't know if you like beer , senator , or not ? What do you like to drink ? ''
Similarly , when Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar asked Kavanaugh if he ’ d ever blacked out while drinking , Kavanaugh said no , and then said , `` I 'm curious if you have ? ''
Later in the hearing , after a brief break , Kavanaugh expressed regret over his question .
`` I ’ m sorry I did that , '' he told Klobuchar . `` This is a tough process . ''
The judged choked up repeatedly throughout his opening statement , including recounting how his 10-year-old daughter said of Ford , `` We should pray for the woman . ''
At another point , Kavanaugh said , `` I am never going to get my reputation back . My life is totally and permanently altered . '' Cornyn replied , `` Judge , do n't give up . ''
Kavanaugh insisted the allegations are n't true , and said , `` I ’ ve never sexually assaulted anyone . '' He added , `` I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process . ''
Kavanaugh rebutted a number of claims from Ford , who said he attempted to rape her at a party in 1982 : Kavanaugh said he didn ’ t run in the same crowd as Ford ; he referenced that the others listed as being at the party said later they did n't remember it ; he pointed out how Ford didn ’ t remember where the party was or how she got there ; and he said his personal calendars from the time didn ’ t indicate he attended a party like the one described .
`` I 'm not questioning that Dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person in some place at some time , '' he said . `` But I have never done this to her or to anyone . That 's not who I am , it is not who I was . I am innocent of this charge . ''
Ford , however , was equally adamant in standing by her account . She , too , choked up at times but voiced confidence , under sustained questioning , that the judge attacked her .
`` So what you are telling us is that this could not be a case of mistaken identity ? '' Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D-Calif. , asked .
`` Absolutely not , '' Ford replied . She added she 's `` 100 percent '' certain it was Kavanaugh who attacked her .
As her testimony was winding down , Ford was pressed by questioner Rachel Mitchell about how the four people named by Ford as being at the party have said they have no memory of the event . She dismissed the significance of that , saying `` nothing remarkable happened '' to two of them that evening ; the other two are the ones being accused .
And in a striking moment , Ford said the one female there , her friend Leland Ingham , has `` significant health challenges '' and is getting treatment . Ford said Ingham texted her an apology following her statement claiming no recollection of the party , while saying she would n't expect her to remember the incident since she was downstairs .
The partisan divide over the allegations was on full display , with Democrats assuring Ford they support her . `` I want to thank you for your courage and I want to tell you I believe you , '' California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris told Ford during the hearing .
Republicans still expressed skepticism about the allegations but did not criticize Ford herself . Cornyn said after her testimony he found no reason `` to find her not credible '' but said `` there are obviously gaps in her story . '' Graham said he was n't convinced : `` I did not find her allegations to be corroborated against Mr . Kavanaugh . ''
In her opening remarks , Ford choked up as she described growing up in the suburbs of Washington , D.C. , and hanging out with boys from different schools in the area , including Kavanaugh , `` the boy who sexually assaulted me . ''
Ford then described a drunk Kavanaugh attacking her in the 1980s at a high school party . She told senators she `` thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me . '' Ford said she was able to run away .
On Thursday , Ford said she was `` terrified '' to detail her accusations but felt it was her `` civic duty . ''
She continued , `` I believed he was going to rape me . ''
Ford said Kavanaugh caught her in a room , while a friend , Mark Judge , was present . Ford said the strongest memory she had of the event was the `` uproarious laughter between the two , and they 're having fun at my expense . ''
Thursday ’ s hearing followed days of negotiations between Senate Republicans and Ford ’ s attorneys – and amid more lurid last-minute allegations from other women who have accused Kavanaugh of improper sexual behavior in high school and college .
The stakes for Kavanaugh could not be higher : Key swing-vote senators have said Thursday 's hearing would present a pivotal opportunity to assess Ford 's credibility and determine whether to advance Kavanaugh to the nation 's highest court .
Republicans retained Mitchell , an experienced sex-crimes prosecutor , to handle some of their questioning , hoping it would help avoid an overtly political atmosphere . Republicans , through Mitchell , questioned Ford on apparent discrepancies or holes in the story .
In one curious exchange , Ford acknowledged she didn ’ t personally pay for the polygraph examination she took in August , and said she doesn ’ t know who did . Later in the hearing , her attorney Debra Katz said Ford ’ s `` lawyers have paid for her polygraph . ''
Another Ford attorney , Michael Bromwich , said during the hearing that Ford 's attorneys have been working pro bono .
Pressed by Mitchell , Ford said she couldn ’ t be more specific about the date of the incident , other than it was likely in 1982 .
Under questioning from Mitchell , Ford said the area of the party was probably about a 20-minute drive from her parents ’ home . She said someone probably drove her there , but she could not remember who it was .
`` Has anyone come forward to say to you , 'hey , remember , I was one who drove you home ? '' Mitchell asked .
Mitchell pressed Ford over her reported comments that she was reluctant to give an interview to the committee because of her fear of flying . Asked how she traveled from California to Washington for Thursday 's hearing , Ford acknowledged she flew .
`` I eventually was able to get up the gumption with the help of some friends and get on the plane , '' she said . Ford acknowledged she regularly flies – including once a year during the summer to visit family on the East Coast .
The hearing , which for days had been in doubt , was the first chance for the public to see Ford , in person , explain in detail what she claimed happened at the Maryland house party in 1982 where Kavanaugh allegedly jumped on top of her and tried to muffle her screams -- and why she did n't tell anyone about the episode until 2012 .
`` He began running his hands over my body and grinding into me , '' Ford testified on Thursday , describing that day . `` I tried to get away from him , but his weight was heavy . Brett groped me and tried to take off my clothes . ''
She said she eventually got away , locking herself in a bathroom as the two eventually went downstairs .
In her opening statement , Ford said she remembered `` four boys '' being at the party , including one `` whose name I can not recall . '' The people she did name -- Kavanaugh and his classmates Mark Judge and P.J . Smyth -- have denied under penalty of felony knowing anything about the alleged episode .
Ford also named a girl , `` my friend Leland Ingham , '' as also being in attendance . Ingham , in a previously released statement , has denied knowing Kavanaugh or having information about the alleged assault .
Ford told senators she finally decided to disclose the alleged assault during a therapy session in 2012 because during a remodeling of her house that year , she insisted on installing a `` second front door '' -- leaving her husband and others wondering why .
Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley kicked off Thursday ’ s highly anticipated hearing before the panel by noting past FBI background checks of Kavanaugh turned up no evidence of any wrongdoing .
`` Nowhere in any of these six FBI reports , which committee investigators have reviewed on a bipartisan basis , was there a whiff of any issue , '' Grassley said .
Feinstein , the committee 's top Democrat , defended her decision not to turn over the accusations earlier to the FBI and other lawmakers . She said Ford wanted it to `` be held confidential . ''
Though she learned of the allegations in July , Feinstein did n't disclose them to her Senate colleagues or federal authorities until days before a crucial Judiciary Committee vote on Kavanaugh 's confirmation earlier this month .
Ford said Thursday she decided to go public with her allegations after reporters began staking out her home and work .
The proceedings were jolted by late-breaking developments : In a statement released Wednesday evening , Judiciary Committee Republicans revealed that on Monday , they conducted interviews with two separate men who claimed they , and not Kavanaugh , had the encounter with Dr. Ford in 1982 .
In response , an aide to Democrats on the Judiciary Committee reportedly unloaded on Senate Republicans , accusing them of `` desperately trying to muddy the waters . ''

`` The Swetnick thing is a joke , '' Kavanaugh said Thursday , raising his voice . `` It 's a farce . ''
On Tuesday , a constituent told the office of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse , D-R.I. , that in 1985 , two `` heavily inebriated men '' referred to as `` Brett and Mark '' had sexually assaulted a `` close friend '' on a boat . But that person recanted the claim Wednesday night on Twitter .
In another case , Kavanaugh was asked by GOP investigators this week about a new claim in a letter received by Sen. Cory Gardner , R-Colo. , from an anonymous individual apparently in Denver , alleging that Kavanaugh `` shoved '' someone up against a wall `` very aggressively and sexually '' during an outing in front of four witnesses in 1998 .
Speaking to Judiciary Committee investigators , Kavanaugh maintained his innocence and lamented the `` total feeding frenzy '' of last-minute accusations .

The court ruled 5-4 along ideological lines, with its conservative justices in the majority and its liberal justices dissenting, that federal authorities could place such immigrants into indefinite detention anytime without the possibility of bail, not just immediately after they finish prison sentences.

The ruling, authored by conservative Justice Samuel Alito, left open the possibility that some immigrants could challenge their detention. These immigrants potentially could argue that the use of the 1996 federal law involved in the case, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, against them long after finishing their sentences would violate their due process rights under the U.S. Constitution.

Most of the plaintiffs in the case are legal immigrants.

The law states the government can detain convicted immigrants “when the alien is released” from criminal detention. Civil rights lawyers in the case argued that the language of the law shows that it applies only immediately after immigrants are released. The Trump administration said the government should have the power to detain such immigrants anytime.

In dissent, liberal Justice Stephen Breyer said the ruling raises serious due process questions.

“It runs the gravest risk of depriving those whom the government has detained of one of the oldest and most important of our constitutionally guaranteed freedoms,” Breyer wrote.

But Alito wrote that it is not the court’s job to impose a time limit for when immigrants can be detained after serving a prison sentence. Alito noted that the court has previously said that “an official’s crucial duties are better carried out late than never.” Alito said the challengers’ assertion that immigrants had to be detained within 24 hours of ending a prison sentence is “especially hard to swallow.”

It marked Trump’s latest immigration victory at the court. The conservative justices also were in the majority in June 2018 when the court upheld on a 5-4 vote Trump’s travel ban targeting people from several Muslim-majority countries.

Tuesday’s decision follows a February 2018 ruling in a similar case in which the conservative majority, over liberal dissent, curbed the ability of immigrants held in long-term detention during deportation proceedings to argue for release.

‘MOST EXTREME INTERPRETATION’

American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Cecilia Wang, who argued the newly decided case for the challengers, said that in both rulings “the Supreme Court has endorsed the most extreme interpretation of immigration detention statutes, allowing mass incarceration of people without any hearing, simply because they are defending themselves against a deportation charge.”

Wang said the ACLU is “looking into follow-up litigation along various avenues.”

Trump has backed limits on legal and illegal immigrants since taking office in January 2017.

Kerri Kupec, a U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman, said administration officials were pleased with the ruling.

The case’s plaintiffs included two legal U.S. residents involved in separate lawsuits filed in 2013, a Cambodian immigrant named Mony Preap convicted of marijuana possession and a Palestinian immigrant named Bassam Yusuf Khoury convicted of attempting to manufacture a controlled substance.

In the two detention case rulings, the Supreme Court reversed the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a liberal leaning court with jurisdiction over a large part of the western United States that Trump has frequently criticized. In both cases, litigation against the federal government started before Trump took office.

In the latest case, the administration had appealed a 2016 9th Circuit ruling that favored immigrants, a decision it said would undermine the government’s ability to deport immigrants who have committed crimes.

The 9th Circuit had ruled that convicted immigrants who are not immediately detained by immigration authorities after finishing their sentences but then later picked up by immigration authorities could seek bond hearings to argue for their release.

Other regional federal appeals courts that have addressed the issue did not rule the same way as the 9th Circuit and were more in line with the Supreme Court’s ruling. That means immigrants in those regions who were subject to mandatory detention already were not entitled to bond hearings.

Under federal immigration law, immigrants convicted of certain offenses are subject to mandatory detention during their deportation process. They can be held indefinitely without a bond hearing after completing their sentences.

In April 2018, conservative Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch joined the court’s four liberals in a 5-4 ruling that could hinder the administration’s ability to step up the removal of immigrants with criminal records, invalidating a provision in another law, the Immigration and Nationality Act.",www.reuters.com,center,UMfxW8bHlnh0gSv7

Since the birth of our nation, religious liberty has laid the foundation for America to become the freest society in the history of mankind.

This spirit of freedom began when the pilgrims fled to the New World to practice their faith freely. It continued when America’s founding fathers ratified the Bill of Rights, which begins with the declaration that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” It was strengthened when Congress almost unanimously adopted the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, ensuring that interests in religious freedom are protected. And it thankfully endured through the Supreme Court case Burwell v. Hobby Lobby.

At issue in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby was the Affordable Care Act’s Health and Human Service Mandate, which would have required our family business to provide and facilitate four potentially life-terminating drugs and devices in our health insurance plan, against our religious convictions, or pay severe fines of $1.3 million a day. Unlike the 16 contraceptives we do provide, these four drugs can take effect after conception, which is where we believe life begins.

Just as religious liberty laid the foundation for America, my family’s Christian beliefs laid the foundation for our business. First and foremost, as Christians, we are called to love people. As individuals and business owners, we try our best to be true to that calling. We provide excellent benefits to our 30,000 employees and a starting wage for full-time hourly employees that is more than double the federal minimum wage. We have also donated half a billion dollars to philanthropic endeavors. Our Christian beliefs also guided my family’s decision not to pay for the termination of life.

Paul Ryan & Ron Johnson: The feds are losing the war on poverty

Fortunately, the Supreme Court issued a 5-4 ruling in favor of Hobby Lobby in 2014, but it’s frightening to think that we — and all Americans — were just one judge away from losing our religious freedom. Make no mistake, the vacancy left by Justice Scalia and the subsequent appointment to fill his seat makes this presidential election one of the most significant in modern times. During a 2015 speech at the Women in the World Summit, Hillary Clinton declared that religious beliefs “have to be changed.”

What I fear she really means is that the beliefs of people of faith across our nation will be discounted, and those people will be forced to violate their conscience under her presidency — a philosophy that would be carried out by anyone she nominates for the Supreme Court.

The Constitution was created for the express purpose of protecting certain fundamental rights — not just when they’re aligned with the current administration’s policies, and not just when they’re convenient — but as the highest priority for our lawmakers and elected officials.

Clinton has made no secret she believes government interests supersede the protection of religious liberty.

In contrast, Donald Trump has been steadfast in expressing his commitment to uphold the Constitution, and his list of possible Supreme Court nominees inspires confidence that there is hope in my future — and in my grandchildren’s future — for a country that will value those most fundamental rights.

America’s foundation of religious liberty is already at risk. With Hillary Clinton as president, our foundation will surely crumble. For Americans who value freedom of religion, we must elect a president who will support a Supreme Court that upholds not only this freedom, but all that have emanated from it. That president is Donald Trump.

Donald Trump released a list of 11 judges Wednesday he said he would consider for nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court if elected president . The move was seen as an effort to assuage Republican suspicions that he would not choose genuine conservatives to fill Supreme Court vacancies , one of which exists right now .
Trump did not pledge to name any of the 11 judges on the list to the Supreme Court seat of the late justice Antonin Scalia . Instead , he said he planned to use it as a `` guide '' for filling not just the Scalia seat but potentially as many as three other seats that could realistically come open during the next president 's tenure . Three of the current justices are in their late 70s and early 80s .
The list proved Trump 's media mastery once again . He got the headlines , but he did not commit to actually naming any of the judges on the list to the nation 's highest court .
Reaction was predictably polarized . Progressive groups call the judges on the list `` extremists . '' Nan Aron , president of the liberal Alliance for Justice , said the list included `` some of the most extreme conservatives on the federal bench today , '' judges who , if named to the high court , would do `` terrible damage to liberties and protections most Americans now take for granted . '' Ilyse Hogue , president of NARAL Pro-Choice America , called the list `` a woman 's worst nightmare . ''
White House Press Secretary Josh Ernest said , `` I would be surprised if there are any Democrats who would describe those individuals as 'consensus nominees , ' '' the words Republicans once used to describe President Obama 's nominee to the court — Merrick Garland . The Garland nomination has been in limbo for months now , because Senate Republicans have refused to hold a hearing on it .
In contrast , conservative activists and Senate Republicans welcomed the Trump list warmly . Carrie Severino , of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network , said the judges on the list `` share in common a record of putting the law and the Constitution ahead of their political preferences . '' Sen. Charles Grassley , the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , expressed admiration for some on the list .
The Trump list includes six federal judges , all very conservative jurists appointed to federal appeals courts by President George W. Bush , and five conservative state Supreme Court justices . The federal judges are : Steven Colloton of Iowa , Raymond Gruender of Missouri , Thomas Hardiman of Pennsylvania , Raymond Kathledge of Michigan , William Pryor of Alabama , and Diane Sykes of Wisconsin . The five state Supreme Court justices are : Alison Eid of Colorado , Joan Larsen of Michigan , Thomas Lee of Utah , David Stras of Minnesota , and Don Willet of Texas .
What is surprising about the list are the names not on it .
Among them : Brett Kavanaugh , a very conservative and respected judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia , the court that Scalia served on before being elevated to the Supreme Court ; Judge Jeffrey Sutton , a beloved former Scalia clerk , now a highly respected conservative judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit , based in Cincinnati . ( Sutton was the author of two controversial opinions , one in which he upheld Obamacare based on previous Supreme Court rulings , and the other , upholding same-sex marriage laws . ) ; Lastly , not on the list is Paul Clement , who served as the Bush administration 's chief advocate in the Supreme Court and who has become the go-to lawyer for conservative causes in the High Court — causes ranging from the attack on Obamacare to the attack on the federal birth-control mandate because of religious objections .
For the most part , the names that are on the Trump list are not household names , not even in legal households . Some were controversial when they were nominated to the federal appeals courts they now serve on .

Donald Trump released a list of 11 judges Wednesday he said he would consider for nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court if elected president. The move was seen as an effort to assuage Republican suspicions that he would not choose genuine conservatives to fill Supreme Court vacancies, one of which exists right now.

Trump did not pledge to name any of the 11 judges on the list to the Supreme Court seat of the late justice Antonin Scalia. Instead, he said he planned to use it as a ""guide"" for filling not just the Scalia seat but potentially as many as three other seats that could realistically come open during the next president's tenure. Three of the current justices are in their late 70s and early 80s.

The list proved Trump's media mastery once again. He got the headlines, but he did not commit to actually naming any of the judges on the list to the nation's highest court.

Reaction was predictably polarized. Progressive groups call the judges on the list ""extremists."" Nan Aron, president of the liberal Alliance for Justice, said the list included ""some of the most extreme conservatives on the federal bench today,"" judges who, if named to the high court, would do ""terrible damage to liberties and protections most Americans now take for granted.""

White House Press Secretary Josh Ernest said, ""I would be surprised if there are any Democrats who would describe those individuals as 'consensus nominees,'"" the words Republicans once used to describe President Obama's nominee to the court — Merrick Garland. The Garland nomination has been in limbo for months now, because Senate Republicans have refused to hold a hearing on it.

In contrast, conservative activists and Senate Republicans welcomed the Trump list warmly. Carrie Severino, of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, said the judges on the list ""share in common a record of putting the law and the Constitution ahead of their political preferences."" Sen. Charles Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, expressed admiration for some on the list.

The Trump list includes six federal judges, all very conservative jurists appointed to federal appeals courts by President George W. Bush, and five conservative state Supreme Court justices. The federal judges are: Steven Colloton of Iowa, Raymond Gruender of Missouri, Thomas Hardiman of Pennsylvania, Raymond Kathledge of Michigan, William Pryor of Alabama, and Diane Sykes of Wisconsin. The five state Supreme Court justices are: Alison Eid of Colorado, Joan Larsen of Michigan, Thomas Lee of Utah, David Stras of Minnesota, and Don Willet of Texas.

What is surprising about the list are the names not on it.

Among them: Brett Kavanaugh, a very conservative and respected judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the court that Scalia served on before being elevated to the Supreme Court; Judge Jeffrey Sutton, a beloved former Scalia clerk, now a highly respected conservative judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, based in Cincinnati.

A ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would create a volatile situation for both political parties . They ’ d need to collaborate on any federal fix , but they ’ d also be angling for position in the next battle – over whether health-care policy would move toward saving Obamacare or replacing it .
And in the process , both parties would be trying to avoid being blamed for any mess that ensues .
What ’ s at stake in court isn ’ t the whole of Obamacare , but it is an important piece . In the King v. Burwell case , opponents of Obamacare allege that the law ’ s federal subsidies to help people buy insurance extend only to states that actively set up their own health-plan marketplaces under the law . ( They say a phrase in the law , about marketplaces “ established by the state , ” makes this clear . )
By some estimates , 7.5 million Americans in 34 states are at risk of losing their subsidies , because most states opted to rely on a federally created marketplace rather than establishing their own . For many individuals , not having subsidies would make the insurance unaffordable .
Premiums could surge , meanwhile , for individuals who continue with health plans in those same states , because insurers would be struggling to make up for the loss of those subsidized payers .
Republicans , who now hold a majority in both branches of Congress , say they have a plan that can allow Americans to retain health coverage , even if the court rules against the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) as implemented by the Obama administration .
But much remains unclear . Will Republicans have the legislation ready in time for a possible June court ruling ? Will they have the votes to pass it in both House and Senate ? Will their plan really find a viable fix for people who lose subsidies ? And if the Republican-backed legislation differs with President Obama ’ s vision for the ACA , will the president sign it ?
“ People do not deserve further disruption from this law , ” Sen. Orrin Hatch and two other Republican leaders wrote over the weekend in an opinion column in The Washington Post , asserting that their legislation can keep such a disruption from happening .
Mr. Obama would face his own political challenge from the case , which went before the Supreme Court for oral arguments Wednesday .
In a ruling that could come in June , he ’ d potentially be put in the position of having to make a public case for the 2010 law all over again , this time without a Democratic Congress at his side .
As president , he might be able to use the bully pulpit to grab the high ground and blame Republicans for insurance-market chaos .
But Republicans could put Obama on the spot by arguing that the law is unpopular and that the way forward is to chart a new course while offering a temporary fix for those thrown off the subsidies .
Senator Hatch of Utah , joined by fellow Republicans Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Rep. John Barrasso of Wyoming , voiced that goal in their joint column this past weekend .
“ A ruling [ against the 34-state subsidies ] would also give Congress an opportunity , ” they wrote , “ to stop Obamacare ’ s damage and create a pathway to reforms that move our health-care system in the direction of freedom , choice and lower costs . ”
Another handful of Republican leaders , including Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin , wrote Monday in The Wall Street Journal along similar lines .
“ No family should pay for this administration ’ s overreach , ” they argued in the Journal . Their proposal wouldn ’ t extend ACA subsidies to the 34 states , but it would “ offer those in the affected states a tax credit to buy insurance . ”
They proposed that states be offered an “ off-ramp out of ObamaCare , ” so states could opt out of ACA coverage rules and expand the insurance choices available to consumers .
Democrats argue that the ACA coverage rules are vital , to ensure that people don ’ t end up with low-quality coverage .

A ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would create a volatile situation for both political parties. They’d need to collaborate on any federal fix, but they’d also be angling for position in the next battle – over whether health-care policy would move toward saving Obamacare or replacing it.

And in the process, both parties would be trying to avoid being blamed for any mess that ensues.

What’s at stake in court isn’t the whole of Obamacare, but it is an important piece. In the King v. Burwell case, opponents of Obamacare allege that the law’s federal subsidies to help people buy insurance extend only to states that actively set up their own health-plan marketplaces under the law. (They say a phrase in the law, about marketplaces “established by the state,” makes this clear.)

By some estimates, 7.5 million Americans in 34 states are at risk of losing their subsidies, because most states opted to rely on a federally created marketplace rather than establishing their own. For many individuals, not having subsidies would make the insurance unaffordable.

Premiums could surge, meanwhile, for individuals who continue with health plans in those same states, because insurers would be struggling to make up for the loss of those subsidized payers.

Republicans, who now hold a majority in both branches of Congress, say they have a plan that can allow Americans to retain health coverage, even if the court rules against the Affordable Care Act (ACA) as implemented by the Obama administration.

But much remains unclear. Will Republicans have the legislation ready in time for a possible June court ruling? Will they have the votes to pass it in both House and Senate? Will their plan really find a viable fix for people who lose subsidies? And if the Republican-backed legislation differs with President Obama’s vision for the ACA, will the president sign it?

“People do not deserve further disruption from this law,” Sen. Orrin Hatch and two other Republican leaders wrote over the weekend in an opinion column in The Washington Post, asserting that their legislation can keep such a disruption from happening.

Mr. Obama would face his own political challenge from the case, which went before the Supreme Court for oral arguments Wednesday.

In a ruling that could come in June, he’d potentially be put in the position of having to make a public case for the 2010 law all over again, this time without a Democratic Congress at his side.

As president, he might be able to use the bully pulpit to grab the high ground and blame Republicans for insurance-market chaos.

But Republicans could put Obama on the spot by arguing that the law is unpopular and that the way forward is to chart a new course while offering a temporary fix for those thrown off the subsidies.

Senator Hatch of Utah, joined by fellow Republicans Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Rep. John Barrasso of Wyoming, voiced that goal in their joint column this past weekend.

“A ruling [against the 34-state subsidies] would also give Congress an opportunity,” they wrote, “to stop Obamacare’s damage and create a pathway to reforms that move our health-care system in the direction of freedom, choice and lower costs.”

Another handful of Republican leaders, including Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, wrote Monday in The Wall Street Journal along similar lines.

“No family should pay for this administration’s overreach,” they argued in the Journal. Their proposal wouldn’t extend ACA subsidies to the 34 states, but it would “offer those in the affected states a tax credit to buy insurance.”

They proposed that states be offered an “off-ramp out of ObamaCare,” so states could opt out of ACA coverage rules and expand the insurance choices available to consumers.

Democrats argue that the ACA coverage rules are vital, to ensure that people don’t end up with low-quality coverage.

For now, it’s not clear which way the court will rule. Both parties are positioning for the possible battle ahead, but also to influence the ruling itself.

Legal scholars say Supreme Court justices will consider whether their decision will have unsettling effects on the ground. If chaos in insurance markets looks likely, they might be reluctant to rule against the Obama administration and its defendant, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell.

Some political analysts say that explains why the administration has downplayed its ability to put contingency plans in place to help affected states.

Republicans, by contrast, could make a ruling against the Obama administration more likely if they can persuade justices that contingency plans are ready.

“Republicans have a plan to create a bridge away from Obamacare,” Hatch and his colleagues asserted, mentioning the idea of “transitional” assistance for affected individuals. They cited “a great deal of consensus” among Republicans, but made no mention of how to navigate the potential for a Democratic filibuster in the Senate.

If Washington didn’t come up with a timely fix, meanwhile, it could be hard for states to act. Setting up an Obamacare exchange wasn’t a quick process for the states that have done it.

Deep in the partisan trenches

Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington

Republican strategists have been saying for weeks that they believe Brett Kavanaugh could still be confirmed to the Supreme Court - if no new accusers emerge.

Now another woman has come forward.

Deborah Ramirez's recollection of the events from their first year at Yale is admittedly foggy. And as with Christine Blasey Ford, there are no supporting witnesses. Nevertheless, it becomes increasingly difficult for Judge Kavanaugh's side to dismiss what could now be characterised as a pattern of conduct, rather than an isolated accusation.

Thursday's hearing, if it takes place, will probably be as much about Judge Kavanaugh's history with alcohol and the 1980s teen party culture as it will about any specific incident. That is much trickier ground for the nominee.

The latest developments are already forcing both sides deeper into their partisan trenches. The White House is sticking by its man and focusing fire on what it views as a Democratic conspiracy. Those on the left see Republicans in a headlong rush to confirmation no matter the consequences or new information coming to light.

Meanwhile, in the middle, are the same handful of moderate Republican senators. And in just over a month, mid-term voters also will have their say.",www.bbc.com,center,25ffqA91nYTzf2Nz

'' In a 5-to-4 ruling , the justices rejected the ruling and sent it back to the lower court .
Justice Steven Breyer , who delivered the opinion , was joined by the court 's other liberals , Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan , as well as Justice Anthony Kennedy , the swing vote . The court 's conservatives — Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia , Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas — dissented . Thomas wrote a separate dissent .
As NPR 's Nina Totenberg reported last November , the high court was asked to decide `` whether a 2010 state legislative redistricting in Alabama overloaded some districts with black Democrats on the basis of race or party . ''
`` In 2000 , Democrats controlled the state Legislature , and the redistricting process . They used their power to create districts with black majorities under the Voting Rights Act , while at the same time putting enough reliably Democratic black voters into majority white districts so that white Democratic candidates could build black-white coalitions and have a chance of winning . `` By 2010 , Republicans controlled the Legislature , and they set about consolidating the black vote into existing majority-black districts . Under the plan , about one-sixth of all eligible black voters were moved from majority white state Senate districts to majority-black districts . The result was that in some of those districts , the black majority increased to over 70 percent .

According to The Associated Press , Justice Breyer said the lower court `` should have reviewed claims of racial gerrymandering on a district-by-district level , not just statewide .

`` State officials say they had no choice but to concentrate black voters in some districts , making neighboring seats more white and apt to elect Republicans . ''","Supreme Court Rejects Ruling That Upheld Alabama's Gerrymandering

The U.S. Supreme Court called a district court ruling that upheld Alabama's redistricting plan, which overloaded some districts with black Democrats, ""legally erroneous."" In a 5-to-4 ruling, the justices rejected the ruling and sent it back to the lower court.

Justice Steven Breyer, who delivered the opinion, was joined by the court's other liberals, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, as well as Justice Anthony Kennedy, the swing vote. The court's conservatives — Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas — dissented. Thomas wrote a separate dissent.

As NPR's Nina Totenberg reported last November, the high court was asked to decide ""whether a 2010 state legislative redistricting in Alabama overloaded some districts with black Democrats on the basis of race or party.""

Here's the background on the case, from Nina's story:

""In 2000, Democrats controlled the state Legislature, and the redistricting process. They used their power to create districts with black majorities under the Voting Rights Act, while at the same time putting enough reliably Democratic black voters into majority white districts so that white Democratic candidates could build black-white coalitions and have a chance of winning. ""By 2010, Republicans controlled the Legislature, and they set about consolidating the black vote into existing majority-black districts. Under the plan, about one-sixth of all eligible black voters were moved from majority white state Senate districts to majority-black districts. The result was that in some of those districts, the black majority increased to over 70 percent. At the same time, the majority white districts got whiter, and more safely Republican. ""The redistricting came after the 2010 census showed population shifts that made some existing districts way too big in population terms, and others too small. The Republicans tried to equalize the size of the districts. They also tried to maintain the same number of majority-black districts, [contending] that under the Voting Rights Act, a simple majority of black voters in those districts was not enough. ... ""Democrats disagree and contend that the GOP plan calls for unconstitutional racial quotas.""

According to The Associated Press, Justice Breyer said the lower court ""should have reviewed claims of racial gerrymandering on a district-by-district level, not just statewide. He also said the court didn't apply the right test when it found that race wasn't the primary motivating factor.""

The Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Thursday , when Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his accuser Christine Blasey Ford will both face questions about her accusations of assault , is going to be hard to watch for different reasons for different people . The cognitive dissonance stems from the fact that the hearing is functioning on two levels that coexist uncomfortably .
On one level , the hearing will be a televised capsule of the # MeToo moment , considering allegations of sexual assault against a significant public figure . On another level , the hearing will be pure political theater , one act of many in these hyperpartisan times .
In that political dimension , the relevant question isn ’ t what happened decades ago or who should be held accountable for it . Rather , Republican senators will be seeking the cover they need to do what party activists desperately want them to do : confirm Judge Kavanaugh and consolidate a conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court for decades to come .
The disjunction between these two paradigms for the hearing can already be seen in the run-up . Consider the announcement by the committee ’ s Republican majority that its members — all men — won ’ t be questioning Ford directly . Instead they have hired Rachel Mitchell , an Arizona prosecutor who specializes in sex-crimes cases , to ask the questions .
There is no problem of formal legal authority here . Senators can delegate question-asking to staff members if they so choose , and in some specialized hearings it might even be described as ordinary practice . But when television cameras are watching , modern senators almost always do the questioning themselves .
Seen from the standpoint of a # MeToo investigation , the decision to outsource the questioning to a woman who is not a senator seems at least a bit condescending . It looks as though the committee Republicans are so predetermined not to believe Ford that they need a buffer between them and her . A similar possibility is that the committee Republicans want to express skepticism about Ford ’ s account but don ’ t want to do it themselves on camera .
Understood politically , however , the decision not to question Ford directly has a certain logic to it . The Republicans remember the terrible optics when male Judiciary Committee members went after Anita Hill for her sexual harassment claims during Justice Clarence Thomas ’ s confirmation hearings in 1991 . They don ’ t want to create the same visual again — because it would raise the cost of voting to confirm Kavanaugh .
The political aspects of the coming hearing also help explain why Kavanaugh has adopted a strategy of outright denial of all allegations , rather than offering apologies for drunken behavior and saying he doesn ’ t remember the incidents alleged to have happened . Kavanaugh is not seeking # MeToo absolution . He ’ s seeking to get confirmed to the Supreme Court .
Voting to confirm Kavanaugh is much easier for Senate Republicans if the nominee gives a straightforward denial . It allows senators to say that the facts are disputed and , given the doubt that creates , that they will vote to confirm an accomplished jurist with an otherwise strong record .

The cognitive dissonance stems from the fact that the hearing is functioning on two levels that coexist uncomfortably.

Kavanaugh to Deny Allegations, Tell Panel He Wasn't Perfect

On one level, the hearing will be a televised capsule of the #MeToo moment, considering allegations of sexual assault against a significant public figure. On another level, the hearing will be pure political theater, one act of many in these hyperpartisan times.

In that political dimension, the relevant question isn’t what happened decades ago or who should be held accountable for it. Rather, Republican senators will be seeking the cover they need to do what party activists desperately want them to do: confirm Judge Kavanaugh and consolidate a conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court for decades to come.

The disjunction between these two paradigms for the hearing can already be seen in the run-up. Consider the announcement by the committee’s Republican majority that its members — all men — won’t be questioning Ford directly. Instead they have hired Rachel Mitchell, an Arizona prosecutor who specializes in sex-crimes cases, to ask the questions.

There is no problem of formal legal authority here. Senators can delegate question-asking to staff members if they so choose, and in some specialized hearings it might even be described as ordinary practice.

Guns : when and how to regulate them . It 's one of the biggest issues across the country . But the U.S. Supreme Court has rarely weighed in on the issue . In modern times , it has ruled decisively just twice . Now it 's on the brink of doing so again .
With the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy , there now are five conservative justices who may be willing to shut down many attempts at regulation , just as the NRA 's lock on state legislatures may be waning .
For the past decade , the court has been wary of gun cases . In 2008 the court ruled for the first time that the Second Amendment right to bear arms is an individual right . Two years later , the court said that right applied to state laws , not just federal laws regulating gun ownership and use . Since then , however , there has been radio silence as the justices have turned away challenges , one after another , to gun laws across the country . Until now .
On Monday the court hears arguments in a case from New York , a city and a state with some of the toughest gun regulations in the country . Several gun owners and the NRA 's New York affiliate challenged the rules for having a handgun at home . They contended the city gun license was so restrictive it was unconstitutional .
Specifically , they said the state law and city regulations violated the right to bear arms because they forbid handgun owners from carrying their pistols anywhere other than seven firing ranges within the city limits . That meant that pistol owners could not carry their guns to a second home , or to shooting ranges or competitions in other states nearby . The lower courts upheld the regulations as justified to protect safety in the most densely populated city in the country .
But when the Supreme Court agreed to hear the gun owners ' appeal , the state and the city changed the law to allow handgun owners to transport their locked and unloaded guns to second homes or shooting ranges outside the city .
With those changes , the first question Monday will be whether the case is moot and should be thrown out because New York has already given the gun owners everything they asked for in their lawsuit .
`` This is an instance where it appears the petitioners wo n't say 'yes ' for an answer , '' says James Johnson , counsel for the city of New York .
But former Solicitor General Paul Clement , who represents the gun owners , counters that the amended regulations still give the city too much power to regulate .
`` The city of New York never expressed any doubt about the constitutionality of these regulations when they were winning in the district court and the court of appeals , '' argues Clement . `` And then lo and behold , all of a sudden the city decides you know maybe we do n't need these regulations after all . ''
And , he observes , the city is still defending the original regulations .
The city is indeed doing that because the justices refused in October to throw the case out on mootness grounds , opting instead to hear the mootness arguments today , along with the direct challenge to the regulations themselves .
That does put the city in a weird position . The city is forced to defend regulations that are no longer in place , and that it claims it has no intention of reviving .
`` It 's our position that by justifiably restricting the ability to carry firearms broadly on the streets of New York , it contributes to making the city safe , '' says Johnson .
And there 's the rub . What did the Supreme Court mean in its 2008 decision when it said that the right to bear arms is an individual right ? Back then , Justice Antonin Scalia , writing for the five justice court majority , framed the right most explicitly as the right to own a gun for self-defense in one 's home .
Moreover , the opinion contained a paragraph of specific qualifiers that , according to court sources , were added to Scalia 's opinion at the insistence of Justice Kennedy , who provided the fifth vote needed to prevail in the case . The court said , for instance , that its opinion `` cast no doubt on '' longstanding bans on `` carrying firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings , or bans on dangerous and unusual weapons . ''
`` It will make a difference that Justice Kavanaugh is on the court . ''
But Kennedy — who insisted on that limiting language — has now retired , replaced by Justice Brett Kavanaugh . And Kavanaugh , as a lower court judge , wrote in favor of expansive gun rights .
`` I do think it will make a difference that Justice Kavanaugh is on the court , '' says the gun owners ' Clement .
He notes that not only does Kavanaugh have a record sympathetic to broad gun rights , but that the new justice was constrained by the court 's precedents when he sat on the lower court .
`` Now he can interpret the Constitution in a different way in his new perch , '' says Clement . `` He 's somebody who I would think is going to be receptive to arguments that the Second Amendment fully protects an individual right and is not strictly limited to the home . ''
New York argues that the history of gun ownership dating back to Colonial times shows that in this densely populated city , the law forbids the discharge of firearms on `` any street , lane , alley , garden or other places where people frequently walk .

Guns: when and how to regulate them. It's one of the biggest issues across the country. But the U.S. Supreme Court has rarely weighed in on the issue. In modern times, it has ruled decisively just twice. Now it's on the brink of doing so again.

With the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, there now are five conservative justices who may be willing to shut down many attempts at regulation, just as the NRA's lock on state legislatures may be waning.

For the past decade, the court has been wary of gun cases. In 2008 the court ruled for the first time that the Second Amendment right to bear arms is an individual right. Two years later, the court said that right applied to state laws, not just federal laws regulating gun ownership and use. Since then, however, there has been radio silence as the justices have turned away challenges, one after another, to gun laws across the country. Until now.

On Monday the court hears arguments in a case from New York, a city and a state with some of the toughest gun regulations in the country. Several gun owners and the NRA's New York affiliate challenged the rules for having a handgun at home. They contended the city gun license was so restrictive it was unconstitutional.

Specifically, they said the state law and city regulations violated the right to bear arms because they forbid handgun owners from carrying their pistols anywhere other than seven firing ranges within the city limits. That meant that pistol owners could not carry their guns to a second home, or to shooting ranges or competitions in other states nearby. The lower courts upheld the regulations as justified to protect safety in the most densely populated city in the country.

But when the Supreme Court agreed to hear the gun owners' appeal, the state and the city changed the law to allow handgun owners to transport their locked and unloaded guns to second homes or shooting ranges outside the city.

""Won't say 'yes' for an answer""

With those changes, the first question Monday will be whether the case is moot and should be thrown out because New York has already given the gun owners everything they asked for in their lawsuit.

""This is an instance where it appears the petitioners won't say 'yes' for an answer,"" says James Johnson, counsel for the city of New York.

But former Solicitor General Paul Clement, who represents the gun owners, counters that the amended regulations still give the city too much power to regulate.

""The city of New York never expressed any doubt about the constitutionality of these regulations when they were winning in the district court and the court of appeals,"" argues Clement. ""And then lo and behold, all of a sudden the city decides you know maybe we don't need these regulations after all.""

And, he observes, the city is still defending the original regulations.

The city is indeed doing that because the justices refused in October to throw the case out on mootness grounds, opting instead to hear the mootness arguments today, along with the direct challenge to the regulations themselves.

Defending nonexistent laws

That does put the city in a weird position. The city is forced to defend regulations that are no longer in place, and that it claims it has no intention of reviving.

""It's our position that by justifiably restricting the ability to carry firearms broadly on the streets of New York, it contributes to making the city safe,"" says Johnson.

And there's the rub. What did the Supreme Court mean in its 2008 decision when it said that the right to bear arms is an individual right? Back then, Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the five justice court majority, framed the right most explicitly as the right to own a gun for self-defense in one's home.

Moreover, the opinion contained a paragraph of specific qualifiers that, according to court sources, were added to Scalia's opinion at the insistence of Justice Kennedy, who provided the fifth vote needed to prevail in the case. The court said, for instance, that its opinion ""cast no doubt on"" longstanding bans on ""carrying firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or bans on dangerous and unusual weapons.""

""It will make a difference that Justice Kavanaugh is on the court.""

But Kennedy — who insisted on that limiting language — has now retired, replaced by Justice Brett Kavanaugh. And Kavanaugh, as a lower court judge, wrote in favor of expansive gun rights.

""I do think it will make a difference that Justice Kavanaugh is on the court,"" says the gun owners' Clement.

He notes that not only does Kavanaugh have a record sympathetic to broad gun rights, but that the new justice was constrained by the court's precedents when he sat on the lower court.

""Now he can interpret the Constitution in a different way in his new perch,"" says Clement. ""He's somebody who I would think is going to be receptive to arguments that the Second Amendment fully protects an individual right and is not strictly limited to the home.""



Manhattan: 1.6 million residents in 23 square miles

New York argues that the history of gun ownership dating back to Colonial times shows that in this densely populated city, the law forbids the discharge of firearms on ""any street, lane, alley, garden or other places where people frequently walk."" And by 1784 the state regulated the storage and transport of gun powder, too.

Today, as the city observes in its briefs, the city is far and away the most densely populated city in the country, with 27,000 residents per square mile. Manhattan alone packs around 1.6 million residents into 23 square miles, and that population doubles every weekday with commuters. These people, plus tens of thousands of tourists, move through through the city's crowded streets, traveling ""to, near and around a staggering concentration of sensitive places such as schools, daycare centers, government buildings, playgrounds and places of worship"" — all places that the Supreme Court seemed to say in 2008 are legitimate places to ban guns.

Countering that argument, lawyer Clement maintains that the Founding Fathers never intended the right to own a gun to be limited to the home. At the very minimum, he notes, our Founders allowed gun owners to carry their firearms from one place to another.

Libraries are not lethal

Like any good advocate, Clement is offering the justices alternative routes to a gun-friendly ruling.

""They could say the Second Amendment is not limited strictly to the home and therefore this regulation has to go,"" says Clement. Even that, he would see as a major victory.

The alternative and broader ruling, he says, would treat the right to own a gun in the same way that limits on free speech are treated. With considerable suspicion.



""I don't think anybody would think that if the city of New York said, you know we have seven perfectly nice libraries in the city of New York and there's really no reason for any of you to go to libraries in New Jersey,"" posits Clement. ""Everybody would recognize that that's clearly a First Amendment problem.""

Johnson, the city's lawyer, dismisses that analogy, noting that libraries have no ""lethality.""

""It kind of falls on me""

And that's something at least one of the individual plaintiffs on the gun-rights side thinks. Retired NYC bus driver Efrain Alvarez is one of the three individuals joining the New York State Rifle & Pistol Association to challenge this law.

""If a bad apple grabs a gun and he does something stupid, it kind of falls on me because I'm part of what's going on,"" Alvarez said in an interview with Reuters. In that same interview, he said he admires the NRA but sometimes disagrees with its policies.

Alvarez has had his handgun license suspended twice in the past decade. Most recently the city confiscated 45 firearms, including five handguns, from a steel vault in his back bedroom.

`` Chief Justice Rehnquist did bring a sort of solemnity to the occasion or a seriousness that tried to sort of tamp down maybe on politics and really focus on the facts of the case , '' said Robert Schaffer , who was a Rehnquist law clerk during that momentous court term .
Despite voting as a member of the high court a year earlier to allow a sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton to proceed -- which set the subsequent impeachment process in motion -- there was no real objection to having Rehnquist preside .

The chief justice, for the most part, has maintained his steady, low-key leadership under both Republican and Democratic presidents, and the 64-year-old Roberts is unlikely to care much what is said about him personally. Life tenure on the bench gives him such security.

But he knows maintaining his -- and the court's reputation -- during a hyper-partisan impeachment drama will test his leadership skills. Colleagues say he is fully prepared for the challenge.

""He has a history of being a very impartial, fair, almost umpire-like justice, who calls them as he sees them,"" said Schaffer. ""I don't think he'll treat this trial any differently.""

Again and again, Kennedy made rulings that aggrandized the power of the Court and of himself as its swing justice. No justice, right or left, was more willing to substitute his judgment for that of elected officials and voters. No justice was less willing to tie himself down to clear rules or a legal philosophy that would constrain him in future cases, let alone rules or a philosophy that bore a plausible relation to the Constitution. We moved toward a system of government no Founder intended, in which his whim determined policy on a vast range of issues.

Still a conservative

However, sometimes Kennedy voted with the four conservatives on the bench. It was Kennedy who penned the majority opinion in Citizens United v. FEC -- striking down election spending limits for corporations and unions in support of individual candidates.

He's also sided with the right side of the bench on issues such as gun control and voting rights. Kennedy joined Chief Justice John Roberts' 2012 opinion, Shelby County V. Holder striking down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act.

And Kennedy sided with George W. Bush in the case that essentially decided the 2000 presidential election for the GOP candidate.

Why now?

On one side is his age -- a desire to spend more time with his grandchildren is driving any decision, and in many ways he has already established an enduring legacy on the court.

In terms of a replacement, Kennedy might take comfort in the list of 20 judges Trump has vowed to draw from when considering the next vacancy on the court.

Another consideration is that if Kennedy were to delay his retirement for a year, his replacement would face confirmation during the mid-term election year, something that could further inject politics into an already controversial process.

Dig a little deeper , and you ’ ll find potentially momentous implications for the nationwide debate over school choice voucher programs .
The case to be argued before the high court on Wednesday – now with a full complement of nine justices after Justice Neil Gorsuch took his seat at the bench this week – dates back to 2012 , when the Trinity Lutheran Church in Columbia , Mo. , applied for a state grant to fund the resurfacing of its preschool ’ s playground with recycled tire rubber . While the state ranked the church ’ s application fifth out of the 44 it received , it denied the application , citing a provision in the Missouri constitution – known colloquially as a Blaine amendment – that prohibits money from the state treasury from going “ directly or indirectly in aid of any church , sect , or denomination of religion . ”

Trinity Lutheran challenged the decision in federal court , saying it violated both the free exercise and equal protection provisions of the First Amendment , but both the district court and the 8th Circuit court of Appeals ruled for Missouri . The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case 15 months ago , and the unusually long wait before arguments ( the longest such delay in 2015 was 12 months ) is one sign of how contentious the case could be , with the justices possibly delaying until a ninth justice took office to avoid a 4-to-4 tie . ( Missouri Gov .

In Milwaukee , home to the country ’ s first ever school choice program ( created in 1990 ) , Catholic churches now get more revenue from vouchers than any other source , according to research from Daniel Hungerman , an associate professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana .
“ The legal landscape [ around school choice ] going forward is going to matter a lot for the bottom line of churches , ” he says . “ When you think about school choice , and when you think about American religion , in the coming decades the future of those two things may be very much intertwined . ”","Dig beneath the rubber playground surface at issue in the latest landmark case before the United States Supreme Court and you’ll find a tricky question – a conundrum born out of the gray area between the Constitution’s two key religious protection provisions.

Dig a little deeper, and you’ll find potentially momentous implications for the nationwide debate over school choice voucher programs.

The case to be argued before the high court on Wednesday – now with a full complement of nine justices after Justice Neil Gorsuch took his seat at the bench this week – dates back to 2012, when the Trinity Lutheran Church in Columbia, Mo., applied for a state grant to fund the resurfacing of its preschool’s playground with recycled tire rubber. While the state ranked the church’s application fifth out of the 44 it received, it denied the application, citing a provision in the Missouri constitution – known colloquially as a Blaine amendment – that prohibits money from the state treasury from going “directly or indirectly in aid of any church, sect, or denomination of religion.”

Trinity Lutheran challenged the decision in federal court, saying it violated both the free exercise and equal protection provisions of the First Amendment, but both the district court and the 8th Circuit court of Appeals ruled for Missouri. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case 15 months ago, and the unusually long wait before arguments (the longest such delay in 2015 was 12 months) is one sign of how contentious the case could be, with the justices possibly delaying until a ninth justice took office to avoid a 4-to-4 tie. (Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens announced a change in the state policy last week, saying religious organizations are now eligible for those grants, but the case itself is still scheduled to proceed.)

The Trinity case could just be the beginning of “a pivotal period” for the school voucher movement in America, says Patrick Wolf, a professor of education policy at the University of Arkansas.

supreme_court,Politico,0,http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/hillary-clinton-merrick-garland-nomination-226967,Dem senators to Clinton: Stick with Garland,2016-08-12,"Edward-Isaac Dovere, Burgess Everett, Michael Grunwald, Louis Nelson, Sarah Wheaton, Josh Gerstein","Top Senate Democrats are pushing Hillary Clinton to renominate Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court , a move party strategists argue would give her an early advantage against Republicans if she wins the presidency .
They 're not waiting until Election Day — or a lame-duck session of Congress — to define the first major decision of a Clinton presidency .
“ In her first 100 days , does she want a Supreme Court fight ? ” asked a senior Democratic aide .
The calls follow months of chatter among Democrats on both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue that Clinton ’ s smartest political play if she takes the White House would be , essentially , calling the Republicans bluff : they ’ ve praised Garland , but insisted on a principle that President Barack Obama shouldn ’ t get to put anyone on the high court in his final year in office .
By sticking with Garland , the thinking goes , Clinton would save herself some of the political capital inherent in making a court nomination , as well as the stress on what would be a brand new White House staff to vet nominee and promote them on the Hill and in the media .
“ He ’ s somebody who the voters clearly think should be confirmed and has the kind of resonating background that would be broadly appealing to voters , ” said Geoff Garin , a prominent Democratic pollster . “ There are obvious advantages but presidents also like to have the opportunity to make their own choices as well . ”
Some Democrats have even mulled the possibility that , if Democrats retake control of the Senate in November , they might move on Garland in the two weeks after the new Senate is in session but before Inauguration Day . That might take on more steam if , despite recent polls showing him far behind , Donald Trump is elected president .
But renominating Garland would mean that Clinton , who ’ s already running the 2016 campaign as more of an extension of Obama than she ever planned , would have to make one of her first and most significant decisions as president a direct extension of his presidency , long after he ’ s settled into his new home in Washington 's Kalorama neighborhood . It also could cause an instant letdown on the left , which has long been skeptical of Clinton 's liberal credentials and may want a pure progressive choice .
“ Yes . I would recommend it . I think he ’ s an extraordinary judge who has a highly , well-qualified rating from the bar associations , ” said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin ( D-Ill. ) , joining outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid , who Thursday expressed his support for the renomination in a conference call with reporters .
Durbin and Reid are not alone among Senate Democrats spoiling to give Garland another shot under a new Democratic president . Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D-Calif. ) supports renominating Garland , an aide said , as does Sen. Chris Coons ( D-Del. ) . Both are members of the Judiciary Committee .
“ I think she should strongly consider renominating him , ” said Coons , in an interview late last month during the Democratic convention .
Coons , who said he was still optimistic about the lame duck , warned his Republican colleagues that they shouldn ’ t let it get to the point when they risk a President Clinton , fresh in office , nominating a younger and more progressive judge .
“ He ’ s somebody who the voters clearly think should be confirmed , ” said a prominent Democratic pollster of Merrick Garland . | AP Photo
Reid went further than anyone else on Thursday , professing not only hope that Garland is selected by Clinton but also predicting that the Democratic presidential nominee would choose Garland in an effort not to “ rock the boat ” upon assuming the presidency .
Incoming Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer , speaking late last month , argued that “ the odds of Merrick Garland getting on the court and getting on the court sooner rather than later are higher than you would think . ”
But Schumer ducked on whether he thinks Clinton should renominate him .
“ I ’ m not going to judge what she should do , ” he said .
Democrats are confident that if Garland received a vote next year he would breeze through the Judiciary Committee and break a filibuster on the Senate floor with support of moderate Republicans and GOP lawmakers who still believe in some deference to the president . Garland already has two GOP senators publicly asking to bring him up for a vote and is likely to find himself increasingly popular among Republicans if Trump continues his sharp slide in the polls .
Sen. Susan Collins ( R-Maine ) told NBC ” s Chuck Todd that Republicans could be “ hoisted on their own petard ” by ignoring Garland because Clinton may choose someone far more liberal .
“ I very much want Judge Garland to be brought up before the full Senate , ” Collins told Todd this week . “ It would be the height of irony if Hillary wins and asked President Obama to withdraw the nomination so that she can make her own choice , which almost certainly would result in a much more liberal nomination . ”
Sen. Jeff Flake ( R-Ariz. ) has already said that GOP leaders should consider confirming Garland if it appears that their party is going to lose the election . Sen. Mark Kirk ( R-Ill. ) , who ’ s trying to hold on to his seat this year , has argued for hearing and said he ’ d consider supporting Garland
The prospect of Clinton going with a new nominee presents other concerns for Democrats . Moderate Democrats like Joe Manchin of West Virginia were already noncommittal about Garland—a more liberal nominee could bleed centrist support . Five Democrats representing red states are up for reelection in 2018 , with their voting records under intense scrutiny in what ’ s already looking like it will be a very difficult year for the party .
Aides to several more liberal senators said their bosses aren ’ t wedded to Garland , and are deferential to Clinton . During his presidential run , Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt. ) said he would withdraw Garland ’ s nomination as president if the spot remained open , though he often blasted Republicans for blockading Garland as Obama ’ s choice . Now Michael Briggs , a spokesman for Sanders , said simply : “ I 'm sure he 'd be far preferable to any Trump nominee . ”
Sanders “ had said he would pick someone different . But it 's not going to be his choice , ” Briggs said .
As Democrats repeat their current mantra that somehow McConnell will break and confirm Garland this year , Republicans say that by pressing Garland to be renominated , Democrats are effectively waving the white flag for 2016 .
“ It ’ s nice that Sen. Reid is reversing himself and no longer claiming that a SCOTUS nominee will be confirmed this year , ” said a senior Republican staffer .
The White House has maintained the same position from the beginning : it ’ s ridiculous that Senate Republicans are engaged in obstructing a Supreme Court nominee , and that the confirmation should come immediately , regardless of the election or other considerations .
Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon declined comment on what she might do as president , but pointed to past statements calling Garland `` a brilliant jurist '' and saying Republicans have no reason not to confirm him .
But Garland backers have welcomed the swell of support after the Democratic National Convention rolled through Philadelphia with nary a mention of the party ’ s Supreme Court pick .
“ This is obviously promising news for the Merrick Garland camp , ” said a Democratic strategist working the confirmation . “ If there was ever a lingering sense that he should be tossed to the side should Democrats win in November , this now sends a strong signal that the Senate Democratic leadership will be standing by him . ”
The strategist added , “ This mostly adds to the inevitability that Garland will be on the Supreme Court—further exposing the Republican stalling tactic for what it is : a joke . ”","Top Senate Democrats are pushing Hillary Clinton to renominate Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court, a move party strategists argue would give her an early advantage against Republicans if she wins the presidency.

They're not waiting until Election Day — or a lame-duck session of Congress — to define the first major decision of a Clinton presidency.

By sticking with Garland, the thinking goes, Clinton would save herself some of the political capital inherent in making a court nomination, as well as the stress on what would be a brand new White House staff to vet nominee and promote them on the Hill and in the media.

“He’s somebody who the voters clearly think should be confirmed and has the kind of resonating background that would be broadly appealing to voters,” said Geoff Garin, a prominent Democratic pollster. “There are obvious advantages but presidents also like to have the opportunity to make their own choices as well.”

Some Democrats have even mulled the possibility that, if Democrats retake control of the Senate in November, they might move on Garland in the two weeks after the new Senate is in session but before Inauguration Day. That might take on more steam if, despite recent polls showing him far behind, Donald Trump is elected president.

But renominating Garland would mean that Clinton, who’s already running the 2016 campaign as more of an extension of Obama than she ever planned, would have to make one of her first and most significant decisions as president a direct extension of his presidency, long after he’s settled into his new home in Washington's Kalorama neighborhood. It also could cause an instant letdown on the left, which has long been skeptical of Clinton's liberal credentials and may want a pure progressive choice.

“Yes. I would recommend it. I think he’s an extraordinary judge who has a highly, well-qualified rating from the bar associations,” said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), joining outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, who Thursday expressed his support for the renomination in a conference call with reporters.

Durbin and Reid are not alone among Senate Democrats spoiling to give Garland another shot under a new Democratic president. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) supports renominating Garland, an aide said, as does Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.). Both are members of the Judiciary Committee.

“I think she should strongly consider renominating him,” said Coons, in an interview late last month during the Democratic convention.

Coons, who said he was still optimistic about the lame duck, warned his Republican colleagues that they shouldn’t let it get to the point when they risk a President Clinton, fresh in office, nominating a younger and more progressive judge.

Reid went further than anyone else on Thursday, professing not only hope that Garland is selected by Clinton but also predicting that the Democratic presidential nominee would choose Garland in an effort not to “rock the boat” upon assuming the presidency.

Incoming Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, speaking late last month, argued that “the odds of Merrick Garland getting on the court and getting on the court sooner rather than later are higher than you would think.”

But Schumer ducked on whether he thinks Clinton should renominate him.

“I’m not going to judge what she should do,” he said.

Democrats are confident that if Garland received a vote next year he would breeze through the Judiciary Committee and break a filibuster on the Senate floor with support of moderate Republicans and GOP lawmakers who still believe in some deference to the president. Garland already has two GOP senators publicly asking to bring him up for a vote and is likely to find himself increasingly popular among Republicans if Trump continues his sharp slide in the polls.

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) told NBC”s Chuck Todd that Republicans could be “hoisted on their own petard” by ignoring Garland because Clinton may choose someone far more liberal.

“I very much want Judge Garland to be brought up before the full Senate,” Collins told Todd this week. “It would be the height of irony if Hillary wins and asked President Obama to withdraw the nomination so that she can make her own choice, which almost certainly would result in a much more liberal nomination.”

Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) has already said that GOP leaders should consider confirming Garland if it appears that their party is going to lose the election. Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), who’s trying to hold on to his seat this year, has argued for hearing and said he’d consider supporting Garland

The prospect of Clinton going with a new nominee presents other concerns for Democrats. Moderate Democrats like Joe Manchin of West Virginia were already noncommittal about Garland—a more liberal nominee could bleed centrist support. Five Democrats representing red states are up for reelection in 2018, with their voting records under intense scrutiny in what’s already looking like it will be a very difficult year for the party.

Aides to several more liberal senators said their bosses aren’t wedded to Garland, and are deferential to Clinton. During his presidential run, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said he would withdraw Garland’s nomination as president if the spot remained open, though he often blasted Republicans for blockading Garland as Obama’s choice. Now Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Sanders, said simply: “I'm sure he'd be far preferable to any Trump nominee.”

Sanders “had said he would pick someone different. But it's not going to be his choice,” Briggs said.

As Democrats repeat their current mantra that somehow McConnell will break and confirm Garland this year, Republicans say that by pressing Garland to be renominated, Democrats are effectively waving the white flag for 2016.

“It’s nice that Sen. Reid is reversing himself and no longer claiming that a SCOTUS nominee will be confirmed this year,” said a senior Republican staffer.

The White House has maintained the same position from the beginning: it’s ridiculous that Senate Republicans are engaged in obstructing a Supreme Court nominee, and that the confirmation should come immediately, regardless of the election or other considerations.

Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon declined comment on what she might do as president, but pointed to past statements calling Garland ""a brilliant jurist"" and saying Republicans have no reason not to confirm him.

But Garland backers have welcomed the swell of support after the Democratic National Convention rolled through Philadelphia with nary a mention of the party’s Supreme Court pick.

“This is obviously promising news for the Merrick Garland camp,” said a Democratic strategist working the confirmation. “If there was ever a lingering sense that he should be tossed to the side should Democrats win in November, this now sends a strong signal that the Senate Democratic leadership will be standing by him.”

The strategist added, “This mostly adds to the inevitability that Garland will be on the Supreme Court—further exposing the Republican stalling tactic for what it is: a joke.”",www.politico.com,left,p6PqHElPhNSocCne

53 percent say it 's too soon to make a judgment .
64 percent of those who favor Obamacare trust the court to handle healthcare policy , compared to only 39 percent who are opposed .
63 percent say they believe gay and lesbian couples have a constitutional right to marry , with 49 percent said that was a constitutional right as recently as 2010 .
Support reaches across most age demographics , including 73 percent of those under age 50 and 52 percent older than 50 .
Democrats , by 74 percent , and independents , at 69 percent , agree gays have a constitutional right to marry .
Only 35 percent of Republicans agree with the constitutional right for same-sex marriage .
Republicans under 50 agree on the issue by 59 percent , compared with 36 percent of Republicans older than 50 .
63 percent of those agree on a constitutional right to same-sex marriage say they trust the court at least a moderate amount on the issue .
Only 25 percent of those who disagree trust the court .
Voters across party lines agreed everyone should be eligible for the same subsidies , including Democrats ( 74/20 ) , independents ( 56/38 ) , and Republicans ( 49/41 ) .
62 percent of voters said they would be more likely to vote for someone who works to ensure a universal subsidy level , compared to 28 percent who said the would not .
Republicans could pay the biggest price : 41 percent of voters say they ’ d be less likely to vote for a Republican who didn ’ t vote to fix Obamacare , compared to only 31 percent who say they would be more likely .
Americans are leery of how the Supreme Court will handle upcoming landmark decisions on Obamacare and same-sex marriage , according to a new CNN/ORC poll , even though they mostly approve of how the court handles its business overall . The poll , conducted of 1,025 adults at the end of May , showed that 52 percent approve of the Supreme Court 's overall performance , with 41 percent disapproving , an improvement from a 48 percent each-way split two years ago.However , the ratings were worse on healthcare and same-sex marriage , with only about half saying they have at least a moderate amount of trust in the court as it considers those issues.On healthcare , with the court considering if the law should allow subsidies for people purchasing policies through the federal exchange : The court 's upcoming decision on the King v. Burwell case could determine the future of Obamacare itself . The plaintiffs in the case argue that President Barack Obama 's signature legislation allows only for federal subsidies on state-run exchanges , not for those in states that use the federal exchange.If the court agrees , 7.5 million people in those states could lose their subsidies , driving the price for their insurance policies up too high for them to afford . Tax credits for plans bought on the federal exchange reduce the monthly cost for those eligible to about $ 100 a month for insurance . But without the subsidies , the monthly cost could go to $ 350 or even higher for the residents of the 37 states that rely on the federal healthcare exchange.Just 13 states and the District of Columbia would not be affected if the Supreme Court rules for the plaintiffs , as they have their own exchanges.The decision is also coming as many Americans who already do not qualify for coverage have been scrambling to find other ways to afford the mandatory healthcare plans , reports The Wall Street Journal . Many people who purchased the lower-cost silver or bronze individual plans on the exchanges have still seen their premiums and out-of-pocket payments climbs from anywhere between 14 percent and 28 percent.The Supreme Court 's decision could also slam Americans who are facing insurance companies ' calls for double-digit premium hikes in some states , like New Mexico , where Blue Cross Blue Shield has proposed a 50 percent premium increase for its Obamacare plans . On the issue of same-sex marriage , the poll revealed : The court is currently divided on the issue , which is expected to be decided later this month . Conservative justices are leaning toward the view that the decision should be made on the state level , while liberal judges say same-sex marriage is a right that should be observed in all 50 states.Only 11 states have granted marriage rights to same-sex couples through the ballot or the legislature , while court rulings resulted in other legalization efforts.The cases are coming before the court from Kentucky , Michigan , Ohio and Tennessee , four of the 14 remaining states that allow only heterosexual marriage.A federal appeals court in Cincinnati last November upheld marriage bans from the four states , marking the only time the states got a federal ruling in favor of their side since 2013 , when the Supreme Court struck down part of the federal anti-gay marriage law.Just 10 years ago , Massachusetts was the first state that allowed same sex-marriages , and as recently as last October , just one-third of states permitted the unions . Now , same-sex couples can marry in 36 states and Washington , D.C. , marking a dramatic change in public opinion.Also in the current CNN poll , the Supreme Court 's trust levels rose on freedom of speech , at 69 percent ; voting rights , at 65 percent ; and the death penalty , at 60 percent.Meanwhile , Chief Justice John Roberts is still carrying a positive opinion among those polled , with 33 percent seeing him favorably and 24 percent unfavorably . This is a drop from 41 percent seeing him favorably after the court upheld the Obamacare individual mandate provision , the CNN poll shows.Roberts ' decline was most marked among Democrats , with 51 percent of them seeing him favorably in 2012 compared to 35 percent now.The opinions revealed in the CNN/ORC poll on Obamacare results mirror those of a new ABC News/Washington Post poll released on Monday that shows most Americans would like subsidies to be left alone , even if they do generally disapprove of the health reform law.In that poll , respondents said , by a margin of 54 to 39 percent , they oppose the law , while 55 percent said the justices should leave the subsidies alone . However , 38 percent of those polled said the subsidies should be outlawed.In another poll released Monday , by Public Policy Polling , 61 percent of those questioned believe all Americans earning similar incomes should be eligible for the same subsidies , no matter where they live.And if the court rules in favor of eliminating the subsidies , the PPP survey found that most voters want Congress to apply a fix so nobody loses their subsidies , and if they do n't fix it , they should lose votes.The findings showed :","43 percent approve of Obamacare overall, matching a previous high in 2013, with 55 percent opposed.

11 percent agree Obamacare is an overall success.

35 percent say it has been a failure.

53 percent say it's too soon to make a judgment.

64 percent of those who favor Obamacare trust the court to handle healthcare policy, compared to only 39 percent who are opposed.

63 percent say they believe gay and lesbian couples have a constitutional right to marry, with 49 percent said that was a constitutional right as recently as 2010.

Support reaches across most age demographics, including 73 percent of those under age 50 and 52 percent older than 50.

Democrats, by 74 percent, and independents, at 69 percent, agree gays have a constitutional right to marry.

Only 35 percent of Republicans agree with the constitutional right for same-sex marriage.

Republicans under 50 agree on the issue by 59 percent, compared with 36 percent of Republicans older than 50.

63 percent of those agree on a constitutional right to same-sex marriage say they trust the court at least a moderate amount on the issue.

Only 25 percent of those who disagree trust the court.

Voters across party lines agreed everyone should be eligible for the same subsidies, including Democrats (74/20), independents (56/38), and Republicans (49/41).

62 percent of voters said they would be more likely to vote for someone who works to ensure a universal subsidy level, compared to 28 percent who said the would not.

Republicans could pay the biggest price: 41 percent of voters say they’d be less likely to vote for a Republican who didn’t vote to fix Obamacare, compared to only 31 percent who say they would be more likely.

Americans are leery of how the Supreme Court will handle upcoming landmark decisions on Obamacare and same-sex marriage, according to a new CNN/ORC poll, even though they mostly approve of how the court handles its business overall. The poll, conducted of 1,025 adults at the end of May, showed that 52 percent approve of the Supreme Court's overall performance, with 41 percent disapproving, an improvement from a 48 percent each-way split two years ago.However, the ratings were worse on healthcare and same-sex marriage, with only about half saying they have at least a moderate amount of trust in the court as it considers those issues.On healthcare, with the court considering if the law should allow subsidies for people purchasing policies through the federal exchange: The court's upcoming decision on the King v. Burwell case could determine the future of Obamacare itself. The plaintiffs in the case argue that President Barack Obama's signature legislation allows only for federal subsidies on state-run exchanges, not for those in states that use the federal exchange.If the court agrees, 7.5 million people in those states could lose their subsidies, driving the price for their insurance policies up too high for them to afford. Tax credits for plans bought on the federal exchange reduce the monthly cost for those eligible to about $100 a month for insurance. But without the subsidies, the monthly cost could go to $350 or even higher for the residents of the 37 states that rely on the federal healthcare exchange.Just 13 states and the District of Columbia would not be affected if the Supreme Court rules for the plaintiffs, as they have their own exchanges.The decision is also coming as many Americans who already do not qualify for coverage have been scrambling to find other ways to afford the mandatory healthcare plans, reports The Wall Street Journal. Many people who purchased the lower-cost silver or bronze individual plans on the exchanges have still seen their premiums and out-of-pocket payments climbs from anywhere between 14 percent and 28 percent.The Supreme Court's decision could also slam Americans who are facing insurance companies' calls for double-digit premium hikes in some states, like New Mexico, where Blue Cross Blue Shield has proposed a 50 percent premium increase for its Obamacare plans. On the issue of same-sex marriage, the poll revealed: The court is currently divided on the issue, which is expected to be decided later this month. Conservative justices are leaning toward the view that the decision should be made on the state level, while liberal judges say same-sex marriage is a right that should be observed in all 50 states.Only 11 states have granted marriage rights to same-sex couples through the ballot or the legislature, while court rulings resulted in other legalization efforts.The cases are coming before the court from Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee, four of the 14 remaining states that allow only heterosexual marriage.A federal appeals court in Cincinnati last November upheld marriage bans from the four states, marking the only time the states got a federal ruling in favor of their side since 2013, when the Supreme Court struck down part of the federal anti-gay marriage law.Just 10 years ago, Massachusetts was the first state that allowed same sex-marriages, and as recently as last October, just one-third of states permitted the unions.

Trump named Gorsuch , a well-respected conservative who sits on the Colorado-based 10th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals , after a drama-packed day that resembled the president ’ s former reality show “ The Apprentice . ”
Trump , making the announcement from the East Wing of the White House before a star-studded GOP crowd , said he had promised to nominate a judge who respected the law and loved the Constitution .
“ Millions of voters said this was the single most important issue to them , and I am a man of my word and will do what I say , something the American people have been asking of Washington for a very long time , ” Trump said .

“ Was that a surprise ? Was it ? ” Trump asked after Gorsuch and the judge ’ s wife joined him on the podium .
He smiled before turning to the couple to shake their hands .
Trump said Gorsuch is a man our country needs to ensure the rule of law and the rule of justice .
“ I hope Senate Democrats and Republican can come together for once for the good of the country , ” he said .
Gorsuch said he looked forward to speaking with lawmakers from both sides of the aisle to answer their questions and hear their concerns .
“ Standing here , in a house of history and acutely aware of my own imperfections , I pledge that if I ’ m confirmed I ’ ll do all my powers permit to be a faithful servant of the Constitution and laws of this great country , ” Gorsuch said .
The White House sought to keep the news of Gorsuch 's pick a secret , and it was kept relatively under wraps .
The president phoned Gorsuch on Monday to inform him he was the nominee , White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters . Staff from the White House counsel ’ s office traveled to Gorsuch 's hometown of Boulder , Colo. , where they met him at a friend ’ s house .
Gorsuch was driven on back roads to the airport and was flown on a military jet to Washington , the spokesman said .
Senators in the East Room for the ceremony said they only found out Gorsuch would be the nominee hours before it was announced .
If confirmed by the Senate , Gorsuch would fill out a court split evenly between conservatives and liberals , with Justice Antonin Kennedy , an appointee of President Reagan , often casting the swing vote .

Gorsuch represented a less provocative choice for the court than Bill Pryor , a judge on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals touted by conservatives . Pryor ’ s views on abortion and gay rights might have made a filibuster unavoidable .
Like Pryor , Gorsuch is seen as an “ originalist , ” someone who attempts to interpret the Constitution as it was written at the time .
But he has won bipartisan support in past confirmation battles . In 2006 , he was confirmed to the appeals court by a voice vote after unanimously passing through the Judiciary Committee with praises from the late Sen. Arlen Specter , a Pennsylvania Republican who became a Democrat after Obama was elected .
A Denver native , Gorsuch was appointed to the appeals court by President George W. Bush in 2006 . He served as a law clerk for the late Justice Byron White and Justice Anthony Kennedy in the early 1990s .
In 2013 , Gorsuch joined the appeals court in siding with the craft store chain Hobby Lobby and Christian bookstore chain Mardel Inc. in their challenge of ObamaCare ’ s requirement that employee healthcare plans cover birth control .
In a concurring opinion in the case , Gorsuch said it was “ not for secular courts to rewrite the religious complaint of a faithful adherent , or to decide whether a religious teaching about complicity imposes ‘ too much ’ moral disapproval on those only ‘ indirectly ’ assisting wrongful conduct . ”
“ Whether an act of complicity is or isn ’ t ‘ too attenuated ’ from the underlying wrong is sometimes itself a matter of faith we must respect , ” he wrote .
The Supreme Court upheld that decision in a 5-4 vote .
At 49 , Gorsuch would be the youngest member of the court — a major consideration for Trump , who wants his picks to potentially remain on the bench for decades . Supreme Court justices receive lifetime appointments .
Like Gorsuch , Trump ’ s runner-up is another young conservative who would have likely pleased GOP members . Hardiman serves on the 3rd Circuit alongside Trump ’ s sister Judge Maryanne Trump Barry and has a record of defending the Second Amendment .
But Trump may have another chance to pick Hardiman in the future . Three of the court ’ s liberal justices , two of whom are in their 80s , could retire on his watch .

But it is unclear whether Democrats at large will back a filibuster . Republicans have 52 seats in the Senate , meaning they need eight Democratic votes to break a filibuster . Ten Democrats are up for reelection in 2018 in states Trump won . It may be difficult for them to filibuster a nominee such as Gorsuch — though they will be under tremendous pressure from liberal groups to do so .
Democrats remain bitter over the GOP ’ s treatment of Judge Merrick Garland , whom Obama nominated after Scalia ’ s death in February 2016 . Senate Republicans refused to give Garland a vote or a hearing , arguing the decision on filling Scalia ’ s seat should be made by the next president .
The fact that the new justice will fill Scalia ’ s seat is significant to both sides .
It raised the stakes for Republicans in 2016 , as a liberal justice would have shifted the court to the left .
The stakes for Democrats in 2017 are somewhat lower , because Gorsuch would replace a conservative in Scalia . That could be another factor in the decision by many Democrats over whether to join a filibuster .
If Democrats were to block Gorsuch , Republicans would face the choice of whether to change Senate rules using the “ nuclear option ” so that Supreme Court nominees can be approved with a simple majority vote .

A divided U.S. Supreme Court ruled that employers can force workers to use individual arbitration instead of class-action lawsuits to press legal claims . The decision potentially limits the rights of tens of millions of employees .
The justices , voting 5-4 along ideological lines , said for the first time Monday that a 1925 federal law lets employers enforce arbitration agreements signed by workers , even if they bar group claims . The majority rejected contentions that a separate law guarantees workers the right to join forces in pressing claims .
The ruling builds on previous Supreme Court decisions that let companies channel disputes with consumers and other businesses into arbitration . The latest decision applies directly to wage-and-hour claims , and its reasoning might let employers avoid class action job-discrimination suits as well .
`` The policy may be debatable but the law is clear : Congress has instructed that arbitration agreements like those before us must be enforced as written , '' Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the majority .
Arbitration supporters say that forum is cheaper and more efficient than traditional litigation . Critics say companies are trying to strip individuals of important rights , including the ability to band together on claims that as a practical matter are too small to press individually .
Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Stephen Breyer , Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan dissented . Ginsburg called the ruling `` egregiously wrong . ''
`` The inevitable result of today ’ s decision will be the underenforcement of federal and state statutes designed to advance the well-being of vulnerable workers , '' Ginsburg wrote .
Ginsburg called on Congress to pass legislation to override the court ’ s decision . Ginsburg successfully issued a similar call a decade ago , urging Congress to bolster the rights of women to press equal-pay lawsuits .
The ruling shows the impact of the 14-month battle over the seat left vacant when Justice Antonin Scalia died unexpectedly in 2016 . President Donald Trump filled the opening with Gorsuch last year after Senate Republicans blocked a vote in 2016 on then-President Barack Obama ’ s nominee , Merrick Garland .
Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas , Anthony Kennedy and Samuel Alito -- all Republican appointees and members of the court ’ s conservative wing -- joined Gorsuch in the majority .
About 25 million employees have signed arbitration accords that bar group claims , a lawyer for the workers in the case told the court .
The workers said the National Labor Relations Act guarantees them the right to press claims as a group , either in arbitration or in court . The 1935 law protects `` concerted activities '' by workers , without explicitly mentioning lawsuits .
The majority said that language wasn ’ t specific enough to overcome a separate law , the 1925 Federal Arbitration Act , which says arbitration agreements must be enforced like any other contract .
That provision `` focuses on the right to organize unions and bargain collectively , '' Gorsuch wrote . `` It may permit unions to bargain to prohibit arbitration . But it does not express approval or disapproval of arbitration . It does not mention class or collective action procedures . It does not even hint at a wish to displace the Arbitration Act . ''
Ginsburg sought to limit the impact of the ruling , saying its logic shouldn ’ t prevent workers from banding together to press broad discrimination claims under the 1964 Civil Rights Act .
`` It would be grossly exorbitant to read the FAA to devastate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other laws enacted to eliminate , root and branch , class-based employment discrimination , '' she wrote .
The high court ruling is a victory for three companies involved in the fight . The group includes the accounting firm Ernst & Young LLP , which was fighting allegations that it misclassified thousands of employees to make them ineligible for overtime pay .
The court was also considering an appeal from Epic Systems Corp. , a health-care software company that was sued by Jacob Lewis , an employee who says the company misclassified him and other technical writers so that they wouldn ’ t be eligible for overtime pay .
The third case involved a Murphy USA unit fighting allegations that it underpaid four employees at its gas station in Calera , Alabama . The National Labor Relations Board had concluded the company engaged in an unfair labor practice by refusing to let the workers pursue their claims together .
Although the Trump administration backed the employers , the National Labor Relations Board took the side of the workers during arguments in October . At the time , the board ’ s general counsel was a Democratic appointee .
The ruling drew cheers from business advocates , who said it will reduce costly litigation .
`` Today ’ s decision is a victory for everyone but lawyers , '' said Andrew Pincus , a Washington lawyer who filed a brief for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce . `` Employees and businesses will continue to have access to a quick , less expensive , and fair system for resolving claims . ''
Some civil rights advocates suggested the ruling will undermine class action discrimination lawsuits , even though the court didn ’ t directly address that issue .
“ The Supreme Court has taken away a powerful tool for women to fight discrimination at work , '' said Fatima Goss Graves , president of the National Women ’ s Law Center . `` Instead of banding together with coworkers to push back against sexual harassment , pay discrimination , pregnancy discrimination , racial discrimination , wage theft and more , employees may now be forced behind closed doors into an individual , costly -- and often secret -- arbitration process . ''
Still , the impact on civil rights claims is likely to be a subject of future court fights . Raymond Audain , senior counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund , said that `` we agree with Justice Ginsburg that the decision does not apply to discrimination claims . ''

The justices, voting 5-4 along ideological lines, said for the first time Monday that a 1925 federal law lets employers enforce arbitration agreements signed by workers, even if they bar group claims. The majority rejected contentions that a separate law guarantees workers the right to join forces in pressing claims.

The ruling builds on previous Supreme Court decisions that let companies channel disputes with consumers and other businesses into arbitration. The latest decision applies directly to wage-and-hour claims, and its reasoning might let employers avoid class action job-discrimination suits as well.

""The policy may be debatable but the law is clear: Congress has instructed that arbitration agreements like those before us must be enforced as written,"" Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the majority.

Arbitration supporters say that forum is cheaper and more efficient than traditional litigation. Critics say companies are trying to strip individuals of important rights, including the ability to band together on claims that as a practical matter are too small to press individually.

Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan dissented. Ginsburg called the ruling ""egregiously wrong.""

""The inevitable result of today’s decision will be the underenforcement of federal and state statutes designed to advance the well-being of vulnerable workers,"" Ginsburg wrote.

Ginsburg called on Congress to pass legislation to override the court’s decision. Ginsburg successfully issued a similar call a decade ago, urging Congress to bolster the rights of women to press equal-pay lawsuits.

Scalia Seat

The ruling shows the impact of the 14-month battle over the seat left vacant when Justice Antonin Scalia died unexpectedly in 2016. President Donald Trump filled the opening with Gorsuch last year after Senate Republicans blocked a vote in 2016 on then-President Barack Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland.

Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Anthony Kennedy and Samuel Alito -- all Republican appointees and members of the court’s conservative wing -- joined Gorsuch in the majority.

About 25 million employees have signed arbitration accords that bar group claims, a lawyer for the workers in the case told the court.

The workers said the National Labor Relations Act guarantees them the right to press claims as a group, either in arbitration or in court. The 1935 law protects ""concerted activities"" by workers, without explicitly mentioning lawsuits.

The majority said that language wasn’t specific enough to overcome a separate law, the 1925 Federal Arbitration Act, which says arbitration agreements must be enforced like any other contract.

That provision ""focuses on the right to organize unions and bargain collectively,"" Gorsuch wrote. ""It may permit unions to bargain to prohibit arbitration. But it does not express approval or disapproval of arbitration. It does not mention class or collective action procedures. It does not even hint at a wish to displace the Arbitration Act.""

Discrimination Suits

Ginsburg sought to limit the impact of the ruling, saying its logic shouldn’t prevent workers from banding together to press broad discrimination claims under the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

""It would be grossly exorbitant to read the FAA to devastate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other laws enacted to eliminate, root and branch, class-based employment discrimination,"" she wrote.

The high court ruling is a victory for three companies involved in the fight. The group includes the accounting firm Ernst & Young LLP, which was fighting allegations that it misclassified thousands of employees to make them ineligible for overtime pay.

The court was also considering an appeal from Epic Systems Corp., a health-care software company that was sued by Jacob Lewis, an employee who says the company misclassified him and other technical writers so that they wouldn’t be eligible for overtime pay.

The third case involved a Murphy USA unit fighting allegations that it underpaid four employees at its gas station in Calera, Alabama. The National Labor Relations Board had concluded the company engaged in an unfair labor practice by refusing to let the workers pursue their claims together.

Although the Trump administration backed the employers, the National Labor Relations Board took the side of the workers during arguments in October. At the time, the board’s general counsel was a Democratic appointee.

Chamber of Commerce

The ruling drew cheers from business advocates, who said it will reduce costly litigation.

""Today’s decision is a victory for everyone but lawyers,"" said Andrew Pincus, a Washington lawyer who filed a brief for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ""Employees and businesses will continue to have access to a quick, less expensive, and fair system for resolving claims.""

Some civil rights advocates suggested the ruling will undermine class action discrimination lawsuits, even though the court didn’t directly address that issue.

“The Supreme Court has taken away a powerful tool for women to fight discrimination at work,"" said Fatima Goss Graves, president of the National Women’s Law Center. ""Instead of banding together with coworkers to push back against sexual harassment, pay discrimination, pregnancy discrimination, racial discrimination, wage theft and more, employees may now be forced behind closed doors into an individual, costly -- and often secret -- arbitration process.""

Still, the impact on civil rights claims is likely to be a subject of future court fights. Raymond Audain, senior counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said that ""we agree with Justice Ginsburg that the decision does not apply to discrimination claims.""
