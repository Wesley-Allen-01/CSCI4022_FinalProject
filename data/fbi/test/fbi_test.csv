It did not go exactly as the lawmakers hoped .
If the House GOP ’ s goal in grilling Strzok at length was to distract from the ongoing investigation of Trump campaign ties to Russia and the president ’ s conspicuously pro-Kremlin behavior—including his recent suggestions that the US might withdraw from NATO—then Thursday ’ s hearing was a success . But the showdown also cost Republicans : They were forced to let Strzok openly defend himself for the first time . And their own eagerness to continue a purely partisan attack on special counsel Robert Mueller ’ s investigation was on glaring display .
At the joint hearing of the House Judiciary and the Oversight and Government Reform committees , GOP members mostly spent their time leveling accusations of extreme bias against Strzok , who played a key role in the bureau ’ s investigations into Hillary Clinton ’ s use of a email and allegations that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia . They read aloud Strzok ’ s text messages to Page , and forced him to read some aloud too . But those texts have long been public and widely discussed in the media . What was new Wednesday was that Strzok had the chance to explain them , and he made the most of it .
Strzok was able to explain why he sent the famous text in which he told Page that “ we ’ ll stop ” Trump from becoming president . He said the text was a response to events that included “ Trump insulting the immigrant family of a fallen war hero , and my presumption based on that horrible , disgusting behavior that the American people would not elect someone demonstrating that behavior to be president of the United States. ” ( Strzok was referring to Trump ’ s attacks on Khizr Khan , who famously criticized Trump at the Democratic National Convention in 2016 ; his son , Captain Humayun Khan , was killed in Iraq in 2004 . )
Strzok continued : “ I can assure you , Mr. Chairman , that at no time in any of these texts did those personal beliefs ever enter into the realm of any action I took . He added that the committee did not need to rely on his word , due the multiple layers agents involved in investigative decisions . “ They would not tolerate any improper behavior in me any more than I would tolerate it in them , ” he said . “ That is who we are as the FBI . ”
Strozk also told the panels that the “ we ” he ’ d referred to in the text about “ stopping ” Trump was not the FBI , as Republicans have asserted , but American voters . His forceful remarks did not appease his critics , but they served to deflate the anti-Trump partisan narrative about him that his critics constructed over months while he remained silent . His statement in defense of himself and the FBI drew applause from some hearing attendees .
Strzok had used his opening statement at the hearing to make an obvious but overlooked point : If he wanted to “ stop ” Trump ’ s election , he could have leaked information on the Trump campaign ’ s extensive contacts with Russia . But “ the thought of exposing that information never crossed my mind , ” Strzok said . That made for an interesting contrast : As Democratic lawmakers noted , senior FBI officials in 2016 believed that agents in the FBI ’ s New York bureau were leaking information intended to damage Hillary Clinton ’ s campaign . The Justice Department ’ s Inspector General concluded this year that concerns about leaks from that FBI field office influenced former FBI Director James Comey ’ s possibly fateful decision to make public that the FBI had reopened its investigation of Hillary Clinton ’ s emails just ahead of Election Day .
Strzok , citing advice from FBI lawyers , declined to detail his work on the Trump-Russia investigation . But he managed to highlight the significance of the Trump campaign ’ s alleged actions . “ If there were people within the campaign who were colluding or working with the government of Russia , then there is very little that is more important for … the FBI [ to ] get to the bottom of , ” he said . Strozk also expressed concern that Russia succeeded in influencing the outcome of the 2016 election by “ putting their finger on the scale ” of American public opinion .
Democrats used the hearing to highlight Republican efforts to hinder the investigation into Trump . When Republicans threatened to hold Strzok in contempt of Congress for failing to answer some questions about the Russia probe , Democrats responded by forcing a joint committee vote aimed at subpoenaing former White House advisor Steve Bannon , who earlier this year refused to comply with a subpoena from the House Intelligence Committee . Republicans voted down that effort . Notably , Rep. Trey Gowdy ( R-SC ) appeared less than eager on this front : He said “ pass ” during the roll call vote .
Democrats also used the hearing to point out that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Robert Goodlatte and Gowdy previously justified their refusal to look into Trump ’ s ties to Russia by asserting they wanted to avoid interfering with Mueller ’ s investigation .
Rep. Jerry Nadler ( D-NY ) , the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee , noted that Goodlatte said last year that “ until Mr. Mueller ’ s investigation is complete , it is redundant for the House of Representatives to engage in fact-gathering on many of the same issues. ” Goodlatte has also claimed that his committee “ would never intrude on an active criminal investigation , ” Nadler pointed out . But Nadler said that was belied by the fact that the Republicans , during an 11-hour private interview earlier in the week , asked Strzok more than 200 questions about the special counsel ’ s investigation , including about the FBI ’ s use of confidential sources .
“ Are we no longer going to wait until special counsel Mueller concludes his work , Mr. Chairman ? ” Nadler asked , adding : “ Or perhaps the rules of this joint investigation , such as they are , operate differently now that we are approaching the midterm elections and special counsel Mueller is closing in on the President ’ s close associates . ”","Republicans finally got their chance Thursday to publicly question senior FBI agent Peter Strzok about his politically charged text messages with Lisa Page, a former FBI attorney he was personally involved with.

The document outlines , with striking new details , the rapid sequence of events that led to Flynn 's sudden fall from the Trump administration . The filing also seemingly demonstrates that the FBI took a significantly more aggressive tack in handling the Flynn interview than it did during other similar matters , including the agency 's sit-downs with Hillary Clinton and ex-Trump adviser George Papadopoulos .
While Flynn is among several Trump associates to have been charged with making false statements as part of the Russia probe , no one interviewed during the FBI ’ s Clinton email investigation was hit with false statement charges – though investigators believed some witnesses were untruthful .
FALSE STATEMENT CHARGES ABOUND IN MUELLER PROBE , IN CONTRAST TO CLINTON CASE
According to Flynn 's legal team , FBI agents in his case deliberately did not instruct Flynn that any false statements he made could constitute a crime , and decided not to `` confront '' him directly about anything he said that contradicted their knowledge of his wiretapped communications with former Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak . ( Federal authorities undertaking a national security probe are ordinarily under no obligation to inform interviewees of their right to an attorney unless they are in custody , as long as agents do not act coercively . )
FBI AGENT STRZOK , WHO INTERVIEWED FLYNN , DISCUSSED 'MEDIA LEAK STRATEGY '
If “ Flynn said he did not remember something they knew he said , they would use the exact words Flynn used , . . . to try to refresh his recollection , '' FBI agents wrote in a so-called `` 302 '' witness interview report cited by the filing . `` If Flynn still would not confirm what he said , . . . they would not confront him or talk him through it . ”
McCabe -- who was fired earlier this year for making unauthorized media leaks and violating FBI policy -- wrote in a memorandum that shortly after noon on Jan. 24 , 2017 , he called Flynn on his secure line at the White House , and the two briefly discussed an unrelated FBI training session at the White House . Quickly , the conversation turned to a potential interview , according to an account provided by McCabe that was also cited in the Tuesday filing .
McCabe said that he told Flynn he “ felt that we needed to have two of our agents sit down ” to discuss his contacts with Russian officials .
“ I explained that I thought the quickest way to get this done was to have a conversation between [ Flynn ] and the agents only , '' McCabe wrote . `` I further stated that if LTG Flynn wished to include anyone else in the meeting , like the White House Counsel for instance , that I would need to involve the Department of Justice . [ General Flynn ] stated that this would not be necessary and agreed to meet with the agents without any additional participants . ''
Explaining why Flynn was not warned about the possible consequences of making false statements , one of the agents wrote in the 302 that FBI brass had `` decided the agents would not warn Flynn that it was a crime to lie during an FBI interview because they wanted Flynn to be relaxed , and they were concerned that giving the warnings might adversely affect the rapport . ''
FBI INCORRECTLY SUGGESTED TO FISA COURT IN WARRANT TO SURVEIL TRUMP AIDE THAT YAHOO STORY WAS N'T BASED ON DISCREDITED SPY 'S REPORT
The tactics were apparently in sharp contrast to the FBI 's approach to interviewing former Trump aide George Papadopoulos , who also pleaded guilty to making false statements and was recently released from prison . In a court filing last year , Special Counsel Mueller 's team took pains to note that FBI agents who interviewed Papadopoulos on January 27 , 2017 -- just days after the Flynn interview -- had advised Papadopoulos that `` lying to them 'is a federal offense ' '' and that he could get `` in trouble '' if he did not tell the truth .
The revelations in the court filing , if accurate , would also sharply differ from the FBI 's handling of its interview with then-presidential candidate Clinton in 2016 , during the height of the presidential campaign . Clinton brought a total of nine lawyers to her interview -- a number that fired FBI Director James Comey said was `` unusual ... but not unprecedented '' in House testimony in September .
A scathing report released earlier this year by the Department of Justice 's Inspector General ( IG ) found that the FBI had taken actions `` inconsistent with typical investigative strategy '' by allowing former Clinton chief of staff Cheryl Mills and ex-campaign staffer Heather Samuelson to sit in on the Clinton interview -- even though `` they had also both served as lawyers for Clinton after they left the State Department . ''
In fact , the IG wrote , FBI officials fretted about how many FBI representatives should be at the interview , for fear of prejudicing Clinton against the agency if , as expected , she went on to become president .
“ [ S ] he might be our next president , '' FBI attorney Lisa Page wrote , in urging that the number of people at the interview be limited to four or six . `` The last thing you need us going in there loaded for bear . You think she ’ s going to remember or care that it was more doj than fbi ? ”
The IG report further noted : “ Witnesses told us , and contemporaneous emails show , that the FBI and Department officials who attended Clinton ’ s interview found that her claim that she did not understand the significance of the ‘ ( C ) ’ marking strained credulity .

FLYNN HAS PROVIDED 'SUBSTANTIAL ASSISTANCE ' ON CRIMINAL PROBE , MUELLER WRITES
In his fateful interview at the White House with since-fired anti-Trump FBI agent Peter Strzok and another FBI agent , Flynn `` clearly saw the FBI agents as allies , '' according to one FBI 302 , which was dated Aug. 22 , 2017 -- nearly seven months after the actual interview . ( The August 302 was from the FBI 's interview with Strzok about the January Flynn interview ; a separate 302 exists for Flynn 's conversations . The Flynn 302 was approved by FBI brass in mid-February , three weeks after the initial interview at the White House . )

According to the Strzok 302 , Flynn was “ relaxed and jocular ” as he gave the agents a `` little tour '' of his West Wing office . ( McCabe reportedly testified later that the agents , after speaking with Flynn , “ didn ’ t think he was lying '' at the time . )
In his report on FBI and DOJ misconduct during the Russia and Clinton probes , the IG additionally noted that Strzok , who was one of the two agents who interviewed Flynn and who was later also fired for violating FBI policies , had compromised the FBI 's appearance of impartiality by sending a slew of anti-Trump texts on his government-issued phone .

fbi,National Review,2,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/liberals-against-investigating-cia-fbi/,OPINION: Since When Are Liberals against Investigating the CIA and FBI?,2019-06-17,"Jonathan S. Tobin, Kyle Smith, Kathryn Jean Lopez, Victor Davis Hanson, Katherine Timpf, Kevin D. Williamson, Zachary Evans, David Harsanyi, Robert Verbruggen, Jim Geraghty","Was there ever a time when Americans had unquestioning faith in federal law-enforcement agencies ? Maybe in the days before Vietnam and Watergate , most citizens did believe that those in charge of the nation ’ s fate could be trusted . Before World War II , the FBI ’ s formidable public-relations machine actually produced a popular radio and television program lauding its efforts “ in peace and war. ” After the war , when the CIA became the country ’ s first full-time foreign-intelligence agency , few Americans understood much about what it was doing , and what little they did know was colored by the government ’ s propaganda efforts .
But ever since the upheaval of the late 1960s and early 1970s seemed to make cynicism about government our new national pastime , the notion that the intelligence community is above politics has been as outdated as the adulation once accorded to J. Edgar Hoover . It ’ s in that context that we should understand the recent debate about whether it ’ s appropriate to scrutinize the CIA and FBI ’ s role in the origins of the Russia probe . Though Democrats are now treating criticism of federal law enforcement as beyond the pale , their newfound faith is every bit as partisan as Republicans ’ newfound skepticism . A sober look at the history of the past few decades reveals that , to paraphrase Clausewitz , in Washington , intelligence has always been a matter of politics by other means .
Attorney General William Barr ’ s decision to launch an investigation into the origins of the Russia investigation has caused some predicable anger among Democrats and other Trump-administration critics . This discomfort stems from what they regard as an attempt to flip the narrative from Trump ’ s alleged collusion with Russia to a dubious decision by the FBI to begin spying on the political opponents of Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration .
Given the failure of the investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller to prove the collusion allegations , Barr ’ s attempt to determine whether the unprecedented probe of a presidential campaign was an abuse of power seems reasonable . But Barr ’ s decision is a huge problem for Democrats who are hoping to pursue the impeachment of Trump by picking up the case that Mueller failed to make after two years of effort .
So we saw CNN crime-and-justice reporter Shimon Prokupecz this week telling host Don Lemon that it is “ troubling ” that the Department of Justice is questioning the work of CIA agents . “ You don ’ t do this , ” Prokupecz said . “ The CIA kind of operates in their own world. ” Indeed the CIA does , but that never stopped Democrats or the press from going all out to probe its activities as long as said activities were perceived to further their opponents ’ political agenda .
Prokupecz and the House Democrats who are rushing to the barricades to defend the actions of former CIA director John Brennan at the beginning of the Mueller probe are acting as if the agency ’ s reputation has never before been called into question . Some of them may be too young to have experienced the political ferment of the 1970s and ’ 80s , in which congressional committees led by Democrats such as Frank Church and Otis Pike conducted far-reaching investigations that embarrassed the intelligence establishment . But surely they have some memory of the debates about intelligence after the 9/11 attacks and the heated run-up to George W. Bush ’ s Iraq War . The only difference between those episodes and this one is that the political parties have switched sides .
In the past , it was Republicans defending the FBI and the CIA against Democrats ’ charges that these agencies were out of control . But since the summer of 2016 , when the intelligence establishment seemed to join forces to raise alarms about Russian meddling in the presidential election and , more important , to raise concerns about untrue allegations of Trump-campaign collusion in that meddling , Democrats have acted as if Langley and Quantico are beyond reproach .
Once Trump started criticizing the intelligence agencies ’ consensus about Russians ’ election interference , and then after it became known that the FBI and CIA had begun probing his campaign in the summer of 2016 , Democrats became unstinting in their defense of the agencies . By contrast , Republicans who had been stalwart CIA and FBI defenders suddenly became bitter critics , demanding transparency and sometimes floating the same sort of conspiracy theories about the intelligence community ’ s activities that used to be the province of the Left .
Sensible people of either party will always seek to mix deference to the intelligence community ’ s mission , which often requires a fair degree of secrecy , with an understanding that all government officials and agencies must be kept on a tight leash lest they abuse the awesome power vested in them .
To those who have followed past controversies involving the FBI and CIA , it should seem entirely plausible that some federal law-enforcement agents could let their distaste for Trump get the better of them . That Democrats no longer care and Republicans suddenly do testifies to the fact that in Washington , most things always boil down to politics .","CIA Headquarters Building in McLean, Va.

Since Trump took office, of course.

Was there ever a time when Americans had unquestioning faith in federal law-enforcement agencies? Maybe in the days before Vietnam and Watergate, most citizens did believe that those in charge of the nation’s fate could be trusted. Before World War II, the FBI’s formidable public-relations machine actually produced a popular radio and television program lauding its efforts “in peace and war.” After the war, when the CIA became the country’s first full-time foreign-intelligence agency, few Americans understood much about what it was doing, and what little they did know was colored by the government’s propaganda efforts.

But ever since the upheaval of the late 1960s and early 1970s seemed to make cynicism about government our new national pastime, the notion that the intelligence community is above politics has been as outdated as the adulation once accorded to J. Edgar Hoover. It’s in that context that we should understand the recent debate about whether it’s appropriate to scrutinize the CIA and FBI’s role in the origins of the Russia probe. Though Democrats are now treating criticism of federal law enforcement as beyond the pale, their newfound faith is every bit as partisan as Republicans’ newfound skepticism. A sober look at the history of the past few decades reveals that, to paraphrase Clausewitz, in Washington, intelligence has always been a matter of politics by other means.

Attorney General William Barr’s decision to launch an investigation into the origins of the Russia investigation has caused some predicable anger among Democrats and other Trump-administration critics. This discomfort stems from what they regard as an attempt to flip the narrative from Trump’s alleged collusion with Russia to a dubious decision by the FBI to begin spying on the political opponents of Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration.

Given the failure of the investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller to prove the collusion allegations, Barr’s attempt to determine whether the unprecedented probe of a presidential campaign was an abuse of power seems reasonable. But Barr’s decision is a huge problem for Democrats who are hoping to pursue the impeachment of Trump by picking up the case that Mueller failed to make after two years of effort.

So we saw CNN crime-and-justice reporter Shimon Prokupecz this week telling host Don Lemon that it is “troubling” that the Department of Justice is questioning the work of CIA agents. “You don’t do this,” Prokupecz said. “The CIA kind of operates in their own world.” Indeed the CIA does, but that never stopped Democrats or the press from going all out to probe its activities as long as said activities were perceived to further their opponents’ political agenda.

Prokupecz and the House Democrats who are rushing to the barricades to defend the actions of former CIA director John Brennan at the beginning of the Mueller probe are acting as if the agency’s reputation has never before been called into question. Some of them may be too young to have experienced the political ferment of the 1970s and’80s, in which congressional committees led by Democrats such as Frank Church and Otis Pike conducted far-reaching investigations that embarrassed the intelligence establishment. But surely they have some memory of the debates about intelligence after the 9/11 attacks and the heated run-up to George W. Bush’s Iraq War. The only difference between those episodes and this one is that the political parties have switched sides.

In the past, it was Republicans defending the FBI and the CIA against Democrats’ charges that these agencies were out of control. But since the summer of 2016, when the intelligence establishment seemed to join forces to raise alarms about Russian meddling in the presidential election and, more important, to raise concerns about untrue allegations of Trump-campaign collusion in that meddling, Democrats have acted as if Langley and Quantico are beyond reproach.

Once Trump started criticizing the intelligence agencies’ consensus about Russians’ election interference, and then after it became known that the FBI and CIA had begun probing his campaign in the summer of 2016, Democrats became unstinting in their defense of the agencies. By contrast, Republicans who had been stalwart CIA and FBI defenders suddenly became bitter critics, demanding transparency and sometimes floating the same sort of conspiracy theories about the intelligence community’s activities that used to be the province of the Left.

Sensible people of either party will always seek to mix deference to the intelligence community’s mission, which often requires a fair degree of secrecy, with an understanding that all government officials and agencies must be kept on a tight leash lest they abuse the awesome power vested in them.

To those who have followed past controversies involving the FBI and CIA, it should seem entirely plausible that some federal law-enforcement agents could let their distaste for Trump get the better of them.

The Justice Department 's official watchdog concluded that the memos Comey kept were , in fact , `` official FBI records , '' and said Comey set a `` dangerous example '' with his actions .
`` By not safeguarding sensitive information obtained during the course of his FBI employment , and by using it to create public pressure for official action , Comey set a dangerous example for the over 35,000 current FBI employees—and the many thousands more former FBI employees—who similarly have access to or knowledge of non-public information , '' the report stated .
While the findings of the probe were forwarded to the DOJ , the department has declined prosecution , as Fox News reported earlier this month . But for Comey , who has cultivated the image of a by-the-book and irreproachable leader since his termination in 2017 , the review shined a harsh light on his decisionmaking in the final , beleaguered weeks of his tenure at the head of the nation 's top law enforcement agency .
The 83-page document outlined a series of violations , including that he broke FBI policies and the bureau 's employment agreement `` by providing one of the unclassified memos that contained official FBI information , including sensitive investigative information , to his friend with instructions for the friend to share the contents of the memo with a reporter . ''
Further , the IG determined that Comey kept copies of four memos ( out of the total seven he drafted ) in a personal safe at home after his removal as director -- and in doing so `` violated FBI policies and his FBI Employment Agreement by failing to notify the FBI that he had retained them . '' The IG said Comey again violated the rules `` by providing copies ... of the four memos he had kept in his home to his three private attorneys without FBI authorization , '' and by failing to alert the FBI once he learned one of the memos contained sections later deemed classified at the confidential level .
Comey 's GOP critics slammed the former FBI boss in the wake of the report . Rep. Jim Jordan , R-Ohio , top Republican on the House Oversight Committee , called his actions `` disgraceful . ''
The report repeatedly and pointedly alleged that Comey wrongly violated policies for personal reasons -- in this case , in order to spur a special counsel probe .
`` [ E ] ven when these employees believe that their most strongly-held personal convictions might be served by an unauthorized disclosure , the FBI depends on them not to disclose sensitive information . Former Director Comey failed to live up to this responsibility , '' the report said .
For his part , Comey zeroed in on a section that said he did n't leak classified material directly to the media -- and urged his critics to tell him `` sorry we lied about you . ''
The inspector general 's separate , broader review of potential intelligence community surveillance abuses remains ongoing . Earlier this month , it emerged that IG Michael Horowitz had referred Comey 's case to the DOJ for a possible criminal prosecution , but that lawyers opted against bringing charges -- with one source telling Fox News it `` was n't a close call . ''
Comey admitted to Congress during testimony in June 2017 that , after he was fired , he purposefully leaked several memos through an intermediary to ensure that a special counsel would be appointed . Comey specifically leaked his memos to a friend , Columbia Law School Professor Daniel Richman , who now serves as Comey 's legal counsel . Richman ultimately leaked the contents of the memo to The New York Times .
The media firestorm that followed the leak proved a watershed moment that led to Special Counsel Robert Mueller 's appointment .
`` Comey had several other lawful options available to him to advocate for the appointment of a Special Counsel , which he told us was his goal in making the disclosure , '' the inspector general report stated . `` What was not permitted was the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive investigative information , obtained during the course of FBI employment , in order to achieve a personally desired outcome . ''
The inspector general report revealed that former FBI agent Peter Strzok spoke to Richman after Comey admitted sharing his memos . Strzok , according to the report , urged Richman to `` please preserve '' anything Comey had given him . Richman told the inspector general that after his initial conversation with Strzok , he had multiple conversations with members of the FBI about the `` mechanics '' and `` logistical complexities '' of retrieving Comey 's memos from his computer .
By June 13 , 2017 , FBI agents went to Richman 's home in New York to remove his desktop computer and returned it only after they took steps `` to permanently remove '' the memos from it . According to the report , the FBI agents also assisted Richman in deleting the text message with photographs of Comey 's memo -- specifically `` memo 4 '' -- from his cell phone .
Public outrage centered on the news that Comey wrote in one of his memos that Trump had told him , `` I hope you can let this go , '' amid reports that former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn had lied to the FBI and senior White House officials about his contacts with Russia 's government .
'Comey set a dangerous example for the over 35,000 current FBI employees . ' — IG report , on Comey 's actions
Flynn later pleaded guilty to one count of lying to FBI agents in the White House .
Although Comey said he wrote the memos so that they would not contain classified information , two of his memos -- memos `` 1 '' and `` 3 '' -- contained information later classified at the `` SECRET '' level . Memos `` 2 '' and `` 7 '' contained small amounts of information classified at the `` CONFIDENTIAL '' level . The FBI designated memos `` 4 , 5 , and 6 '' remained unclassified -- '' For Official Use Only . ''
Comey , whom Trump fired in May 2017 , denied that sharing the memos with his legal team constituted a leak of classified information . Instead , he compared the process to keeping “ a diary . ”
“ I didn ’ t consider it part of an FBI file , ” Comey told Fox News ' Bret Baier last year , referring to the memos . “ It was my personal aide-memoire…I always thought of it as mine . ''
According to the report , Comey reviewed his memos on the back porch of his home on June 7 , 2017 , after the FBI provided them to him . His first reaction was that some of the classification markings seemed `` reasonable '' and some seemed `` overly conservative . '' Comey took issue with the classification markings on `` memo 2 , '' noting that he `` did not see how release of that [ information ] damages the security of the United States . ''
Despite Comey 's comments last year claiming that he considered his memos `` personal , '' the inspector general 's report stated that : `` As Comey well knew , classified information is never considered personal property ; rather , it is the property of the U.S . government . ''
Comey 's memos included a slew of other secretive information , including the `` code name and true identity '' of a confidential source , according to a court-ordered filing by the Justice Department earlier this year .
Comey meticulously outlined `` foreign intelligence information obtained from and through '' the key human source , `` information about whether the FBI initiated coverage through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) on a particular individual , '' relevant `` sources and methods '' used in the FBI 's investigation , as well as `` information concerning the President 's foreign policy decisionmaking , '' according to the DOJ .

The president argues the charges against Flynn were trumped-up and that officials in the Obama administration leaked information about Flynn’s phone conversations with Russia’s former U.S. ambassador after learning Flynn’s identity in intelligence reports to hurt his incoming administration.

Trump and Republicans have also criticized the FBI in their public remarks, suggesting agency officials may have been biased against Flynn and Trump.

Democrats say Barr’s unprecedented decision to drop charges against Flynn after he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI was a political move that has undermined the Department of Justice.

Wray is the man in the middle who is charged with leading his embattled organization while reporting to a president deeply suspicious and critical of the FBI and to congressional Democrats with oversight over federal law enforcement.

Wray has a thin line to walk, seeking to protect his agency but not alienate the president.

But he also acknowledged Wray has an institution to uphold.

“The longer that this lingers, the more suspicion grows and the more he himself is brought into question, and I think that’s unfortunate.”

Flynn was fired by Trump in 2017 for misleading Vice President Pence about his conversations with then-Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak less than a month into the new administration. He pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying to federal agents about the conversations he had with the Russian diplomat about the Obama administration’s sanctions on Moscow, before he sought to withdraw that plea.

The battle took another turn late last month when the government released the field notes in which one bureau agent asked in a handwritten note whether it was their goal to get Flynn “to lie, so we can prosecute him or get him fired.”

Trump allies and Flynn’s legal team said the notes showed Flynn was a victim of prosecutorial misconduct, and they have sought to cast blame on the Obama administration.

Republicans want to know how long Wray has known about these notes and if he could have released them earlier.

Trump’s claims of a bias against him at the FBI are nothing new.

An investigation led by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz was critical of former FBI Director James Comey James Brien ComeyFBI director Wray orders internal review of Flynn case Grenell says intelligence community working to declassify Flynn-Kislyak transcripts FBI director stuck in the middle with 'Obamagate' MORE and other officials for their handling of the Russia probe, but he did not determine a bias was apparent in their decision to open the investigation.

He did, however, determine there were multiple errors in the bureau’s process to obtain surveillance warrants. Wray and the FBI have accepted those findings and vowed to take steps to address them.

There have been some recent signs that Wray is not completely on the outs with Trump and Barr, who praised the FBI for its “relentless effort” to unlock the two iPhones belonging to Mohammed Alshamrani, the gunman who opened fire at the Pensacola Naval Base in December.

Yet it is clear there are tensions under the surface.

Wray has found himself a target for not seeking to root out what Trump sees as corruption within the top levels of the FBI.

Starting in late April and early May, following the release of the Flynn documents, Wray faced attacks from conservative allies of the president.

“Christopher Wray must go,” tweeted Dan Bongino, a conservative commentator, in late April.

Pressure has also increased with acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell’s move to declassify information surrounding the government’s early days of tracking Flynn’s contacts. On Tuesday, Grenell sent a declassified copy of the email that former national security adviser Susan Rice sent to herself detailing a Jan. 5, 2017, meeting with President Obama, Comey and other top officials.

Amid the drip of documents being released, the spotlight has increasingly focused on Wray as questions swirl around whether he can weather the growing pressure.

While Trump has reportedly been encouraged by advisers not to fire Wray out of fear he could trigger a political firestorm so close to the presidential election, some have privately jested that the president doesn’t always adhere to such advice.",www.thehill.com,center,2K41XdnWiMQnVk5i

The president's show of solidarity comes after Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russian officials during the presidential transition.

The retired Army lieutenant general is cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russia's election interference. Investigators are looking at whether the Trump campaign cooperated with the Kremlin's election meddling effort.

Trump spoke at the White House before departing for Utah, where he is scheduled to make a speech.

Flynn’s guilty plea could spell trouble for Trump’s White House.

He is the first person who served in the Trump administration to face charges in Mueller’s probe and could possibly reveal damaging information about other close Trump confidants, or the president himself, to the special counsel.

Trump is responding by trying to undermine the credibility of Mueller and the FBI’s team of investigators.

Trump should be very worried.,2017-12-01,"Andrew Prokop, Zack Beauchamp, Alex Ward, Jane Coaston, Anna North, Emily Stewart, Julia Belluz","Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn agreed to a plea deal with prosecutors in special counsel Robert Mueller ’ s Russia probe . It ’ s the biggest development yet in the investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia — and the legal move that poses the most direct threat to the Trump presidency itself .
Flynn pleaded guilty to a single count of lying to the FBI on or around January 24 about conversations with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in December 2016 , the Office of the Special Counsel announced Friday . It ’ s important to note that he did not admit to colluding with Russia during the 2016 presidential election .
Ty Cobb , a White House lawyer , immediately tried to minimize the importance of Flynn ’ s plea deal . “ Nothing about the guilty plea or the change implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn , ” he said in a statement on Friday .
But the plea deal will strengthen Mueller ’ s sprawling probe into Trumpworld ’ s possible criminal acts and ties with Russia . In October , Mueller charged Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and former deputy campaign manager Rick Gates with money laundering and failing to properly disclose their lobbying work on behalf of foreign clients . Mueller also unsealed a guilty plea in October from former Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos , who admitted to lying to federal investigators about meetings in which he discussed potentially colluding with Russian agents to acquire Hillary Clinton ’ s private emails .
The Flynn plea deal is the most significant moment in Mueller ’ s probe to date . Flynn is the first person who had actually served in the Trump White House to admit he broke the law . And he wasn ’ t just any old official : His role as national security adviser is one of the highest-level and most powerful posts in Washington , and the retired three-star general temporarily had enormous sway over Trump ’ s early policy and personnel choices .
Due to his unique ties to both the Trump campaign and the Trump White House , Flynn is particularly well-suited to answer the two central questions in the Mueller probe : Did the Trump campaign knowingly collude with Russia , and did Trump obstruct justice by trying to limit or derail the FBI ’ s investigation ? A plea deal would get Mueller closer to answering those questions .
The announcement comes after weeks of speculation that Flynn was looking for a way to protect himself from a more serious criminal indictment . The New York Times reported on November 23 that Flynn ’ s lawyers told Trump ’ s legal team they could no longer share information , a move that signaled Flynn wanted to work with Mueller . And on November 27 , ABC News reported that Flynn ’ s lawyers met with Mueller ’ s team , which was the strongest sign that a plea deal was imminent .
There were signs early on that Mueller had a solid case against Flynn . Flynn offered to testify earlier this year in exchange for full immunity from prosecution , but Mueller refused the deal . Now Mueller gets Flynn to talk and also an admission of guilt .
That ’ s of course bad news for Flynn . But it could potentially be even worse news for Trump .
“ When you flip somebody , you ’ re using them to go up the chain , ” Asha Rangappa , a legal expert at Yale ’ s Jackson Institute for Global Affairs , said in an interview before Flynn agreed to a plea deal . “ This suggests that Mueller ’ s investigation is going to go into the even-tighter inner circle of the campaign and possibly the administration . ”
Flynn possibly did many illegal things . He will admit to one crime .
A retired lieutenant general who had served in the Army for more than 30 years , Flynn was named head of the Defense Intelligence Agency , the Pentagon ’ s intelligence arm , in 2012 . There , he clashed with other Obama administration officials , who viewed him as sloppy with facts and incompetent at management . He was soon pushed out , and stepped down from his post in 2014 . By all accounts , he was furious .
Out of government , Flynn began commenting on foreign policy and military issues in the media , distinguishing himself with extreme rhetoric about Islam . In February of last year , to take one representative example , he tweeted , “ Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL. ” This kind of language , combined with his poor track record at DIA , made Flynn a pariah in the mainstream foreign policy community — but a perfect fit for a Trump campaign that was championing policies like a ban on Muslim immigration .
In the fall of 2015 , Flynn began occasionally briefing then-presidential candidate Donald Trump on foreign affairs , and his involvement in the campaign gradually deepened . By late May 2016 , he was mentioned in the press as a potential vice presidential pick for Trump , and in July of that year he gave a now-ironic speech at the Republican convention in which he said ( in response to crowd chants ) that Hillary Clinton should be locked up .
The former national security adviser is in a very bad way
At the time that Flynn was advising the campaign , he was operating a lobbying and consulting firm called the Flynn Intel Group — which , crucially , also employed his son . He also was a frequent guest on RT , the Russian government ’ s English-language propaganda outlet , where he would often espouse the view that the US and Russia had a shared interest in teaming up against Islamic extremism .
It ’ s these activities — lobbying and work for the Russian government — that appear to have first led Flynn into dangerous legal territory .
In December 2015 , Flynn traveled to Moscow to attend a gala celebrating RT ’ s 10th anniversary . He sat next to Putin himself , and delivered a speech to the attendees about his vision of foreign policy . RT paid a $ 45,000 speaker ’ s fee for Flynn ’ s services ; the former general was also paid a total $ 22,500 by Russian companies for speeches during the same trip .
That in and of itself isn ’ t necessarily illegal . However , Flynn reportedly lied about the source of the payments in his security clearance renewal form , saying they came from “ US companies. ” Lying on this form is considered the equivalent of lying to federal investigators , which is a felony — and may be one of the reasons Flynn took the plea deal .
Furthermore , in August 2016 , Flynn ’ s consulting firm was hired by something called Inovo BV — a Dutch company that turned out to be a shell corporation for a wealthy member of the Turkish government . Flynn appears to have continued working for Turkey until November at the earliest , and was paid at least $ 530,000 by Ankara , Turkey 's capital . ( He oddly published an op-ed on Turkey policy in the Hill on election day , without any disclosure . )
Under the Foreign Agent Registration Act ( FARA ) , Flynn needed to publicly disclose any lobbying work he did with the Turkish government when he started doing it . At the time , Flynn ’ s FARA paperwork said he had worked for a Dutch company — not the Turkish government . In March , Flynn filed paperwork correcting this error — admitting that Inovo was really paying him to work on behalf of Turkish interests .
If that ’ s all he did , then he probably would ’ ve been fine : The US government generally doesn ’ t arrest people for filing incorrect FARA paperwork after they correct it . But if there is more undisclosed lobbying for foreign governments — more Turkey payments , or undisclosed activity for Russia — than he disclosed in March , then he potentially would ’ ve faced serious legal trouble .
You ’ d think that Flynn ’ s questionably legal behavior would have ended in November , when Trump announced that he would serve as national security adviser in the new administration . That ’ s especially true since outgoing Obama officials warned the Trump transition team about appointing Flynn . But if anything , it got worse .
Throughout the transition , Flynn had several contacts with Kislyak , the Russian ambassador . In one early December meeting at Trump Tower , he and Jared Kushner talked to Kislyak about setting up a secret channel through which they could communicate , according to the Washington Post .
Then on December 29 , 2016 , the day President Barack Obama announced sanctions on Russia in response to the country ’ s hacking efforts , Flynn and Kislyak reportedly exchanged five phone calls , and they discussed the topic of sanctions . But Flynn reportedly told Vice President-elect Mike Pence and others on the Trump team that sanctions hadn ’ t come up in the calls , spurring them to make false statements to that effect in public . This conversation between Flynn and Kislyak is part of the just-released document the special counsel sent to the court .
In the first week of the Trump presidency , Flynn was questioned by the FBI , in which he reportedly denied contact with Kislyak during the transition . In the same week , then-acting Attorney General Sally Yates warned the White House that intelligence showed Flynn had been misrepresenting his conversations with Kislyak , and that he was vulnerable to Russian blackmail . The White House did nothing about this until it leaked to the press a few weeks later , when they were spurred to fire Flynn on February 13 .
Then there ’ s an entirely separate matter of whether Flynn improperly acted on Turkey ’ s behalf during the transition or while in office . The Wall Street Journal has reported that Mueller is investigating “ an alleged plan ” in which Flynn and his son would be paid as much as $ 15 million for forcibly removing Fethullah Gülen , a Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania , from the United States and delivering him to Turkey . Per the Journal , Flynn discussed this possibility with Turkish government representatives at a December meeting during the transition , while he was the incoming national security adviser .
Altogether , there was a lot of circumstantial evidence that Flynn broke the law . The plea deal where he will admit to lying to federal investigators confirms he did , and he ’ s now trying to minimize the punishment — and the best way he can do that is tell Mueller everything he knows about Trump and Russia .
Mueller will want Flynn to answer vital questions about collusion
The next important question , but the one on which there ’ s been the least solid evidence , is whether other members of the Trump campaign aided Russian efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential campaign . If there was collusion , the thinking goes , Flynn very well may have known about it .
That ’ s probably why Mueller wanted Flynn to strike a deal — one where Flynn likely agreed to a lesser sentence in exchange for giving an honest accounting of what he knows about Trump-Russia ties . Recall that in October the special counsel revealed that George Papadopoulos , a foreign policy aide in the Trump campaign , agreed to cooperate with Mueller ’ s team . But getting Flynn to likely cooperate is a much bigger prize .
And it ’ s possible that Flynn has even more Russia ties than is known , since there ’ s already some reporting that suggests we don ’ t have the full story when it comes to Flynn and Russia . The Wall Street Journal ’ s Shane Harris reported in June that Peter Smith , a Trump-supporting GOP operative and private equity executive , embarked on an effort to track down Hillary Clinton ’ s infamous 30,000 or so deleted emails during the fall of 2016 — and contacted Russian hackers to ask if they had them .
Smith was not part of Trump ’ s campaign . But according to sources interviewed by Harris , Smith told people working with him that he was coordinating with Michael Flynn , Trump ’ s main campaign foreign policy adviser .
While trying to recruit for the effort , Smith also distributed a document naming the Trump campaign as one of four groups involved , per the Journal .
Another piece of information pointing toward Flynn , Harris reported , was that US officials were aware of some intelligence that Russian hackers were at least discussing sending leaked emails to Flynn through a third party . He wrote :
Investigators have examined reports from intelligence agencies that describe Russian hackers discussing how to obtain emails from Mrs. Clinton ’ s server and then transmit them to Mr. Flynn via an intermediary , according to U.S. officials with knowledge of the intelligence .
Smith died this year , reportedly by his own hand , and Flynn hasn ’ t commented on the Journal report . Still , all of this is enough to raise serious questions about just what Flynn knew about this or any other attempted outreach to Russian hackers or other Russian entities .
But we don ’ t yet know if this led to any actual collusion implicating Flynn or anyone on the Trump team . It ’ s at least possible that Smith was just trying to make his effort seem important by name-dropping Flynn , rather than actually working closely with him . Furthermore , Smith ’ s efforts to find Clinton ’ s deleted emails appear to have failed , since the emails never surfaced .
So this could be an issue of vital significance , or it could be nothing — and Mueller is about to find out which one it is .
Flynn is also central to the question of whether Trump obstructed justice as president
Somewhat separate from the question of collusion is the question of whether Trump committed obstruction of justice after taking office , essentially by unlawfully interfering with former FBI Director James Comey ’ s inquiry . Flynn is a central character in the entire drama — and his fate could prefigure Trump ’ s .
“ I think Flynn ’ s value to Mueller is less on the collusion part and has more to do with obstruction of justice , ” Rangappa told me before the plea deal announcement . “ If Trump had any knowledge of any kind of criminal liability that Flynn may have had — and he was trying to get Comey to drop the investigation — that essentially seals Mueller ’ s obstruction case . ”
Flynn was fired on February 13 . The next day , Trump held a counterterrorism meeting with his remaining national security officials — which ended when he ordered everyone except then-Director Comey to clear the room . According to Comey ’ s written notes , Trump then asked him to lay off the FBI investigation into Flynn ’ s Russia statements , urging Comey “ to see your way clear to letting this go , to letting Flynn go. ” Comey refused to make that promise , and Trump eventually fired him .
Whether the president wanted Flynn protected purely out of friendship , or because he feared what Flynn might know , is something Flynn ’ s testimony could help answer either way .
It ’ s not enough , former federal prosecutor Alex Whiting wrote in July for the legal site Just Security , to show that Trump believed the Russia investigation was going in the wrong direction . A prosecutor or member of Congress pushing for impeachment would need to show that Trump was actually trying to cover up some kind of wrongdoing on his own part to establish an obstruction case .
And the specifics of Trump ’ s relationship with Flynn , Whiting explained , matter a great deal on this point :
Did [ Trump ] know that Flynn ’ s story was an important piece in the larger picture , one that he did not want revealed ? Or did he know that the FBI ’ s pressure on Flynn could force him to give up other incriminating evidence ? Far from simply acting to shield a former subordinate and ally , was Trump actually just trying to protect himself , and those close to him ? If the answer to any of these questions is yes , then Trump ’ s actions will have a very different feel to them , and his potential defenses much harder , if not impossible , to swallow .
Flynn may very well know the answer to Whiting ’ s questions . Mueller will likely hear those answers soon .","Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn agreed to a plea deal with prosecutors in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe. It’s the biggest development yet in the investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia — and the legal move that poses the most direct threat to the Trump presidency itself.

Flynn pleaded guilty to a single count of lying to the FBI on or around January 24 about conversations with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in December 2016, the Office of the Special Counsel announced Friday. It’s important to note that he did not admit to colluding with Russia during the 2016 presidential election.

Ty Cobb, a White House lawyer, immediately tried to minimize the importance of Flynn’s plea deal. “Nothing about the guilty plea or the change implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn,” he said in a statement on Friday.

But the plea deal will strengthen Mueller’s sprawling probe into Trumpworld’s possible criminal acts and ties with Russia. In October, Mueller charged Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and former deputy campaign manager Rick Gates with money laundering and failing to properly disclose their lobbying work on behalf of foreign clients. Mueller also unsealed a guilty plea in October from former Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, who admitted to lying to federal investigators about meetings in which he discussed potentially colluding with Russian agents to acquire Hillary Clinton’s private emails.

The Flynn plea deal is the most significant moment in Mueller’s probe to date. Flynn is the first person who had actually served in the Trump White House to admit he broke the law. And he wasn’t just any old official: His role as national security adviser is one of the highest-level and most powerful posts in Washington, and the retired three-star general temporarily had enormous sway over Trump’s early policy and personnel choices.

Comey, who was fired by Trump in May, testified before Congress in June that Trump pressured him during an Oval Office meeting in February to end the investigation into Flynn. Trump's lawyers have disputed that account.

Flynn on Friday pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators about his conversations during the presidential transition with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. about sanctions related to the Kremlin’s election interference. He became the first person to have held a position in the Trump administration to be charged by the special counsel.

Trump in an apparent shift on Saturday tweeted that he had to fire Flynn as national security adviser because the retired Army general lied to Vice President Pence and the FBI.

""I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies,"" he said in the tweet, which was sent while he was traveling in New York City for fundraising events.

""It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful,"" he added. ""There was nothing to hide!""

Two sources familiar with that tweet, however, told The Washington Post on Saturday that John Dowd, Trump's personal lawyer, had crafted that tweet.

After Flynn was fired, Trump said in February that “I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence Michael (Mike) Richard PenceFive takeaways from Parnas's Maddow interview Trump, Erdoğan discuss tensions in Iran, Syria, Libya Trump signs first phase of US-China trade deal MORE. Very simple.”

Some legal experts have speculated that if Trump knew that Flynn had lied to the FBI and then asked Comey to drop the investigation, it could amount to obstruction of justice.

""This is a pretty substantial confession to essential knowledge elements of an obstruction of justice charge,"" Susan Hennessey, a national security fellow at the Brookings Institution, tweeted on Saturday.

Trump told NBC News in May that he was thinking of ""this Russia thing"" when he decided to fire Comey, who had been leading the FBI probe into Russia's election meddling.

“When I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said 'you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, it's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won.’ ""

Comey himself offered a cryptic message on Saturday shortly after Trump's tweet about Flynn's firing.

“Beautiful Long Island Sound from Westport, CT,” Comey wrote in the caption of an Instagram post. “To paraphrase the Buddha — Three things cannot be long hidden: the sun; the moon; and the truth.”

fbi,ThinkProgress,0,https://thinkprogress.org/whitefish-puerto-rico-aftermath-668c3639491a/,Puerto Rico’s power restoration efforts hit a snag as Trump-connected company gets the boot,,,"Puerto Rico ’ s decision to cancel its contract with Whitefish Energy Holdings LLC , a small Montana-based company with ties to the Trump administration , has thrown the island ’ s electricity restoration efforts into disarray .
Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority ( PREPA ) CEO Ricardo Ramos said Sunday he would move to cancel the $ 300 million contract with Whitefish Energy , which has drawn intense scrutiny . The cancellation comes on the heels of revelations that the contract was awarded to a company with deep ties to Trump donors and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke . The contract included a clause that barred the government from reviewing the company ’ s profits related to its electric grid work .
While Puerto Rico Gov . Ricardo A. Rosselló contends power restoration efforts will remain on schedule , PREPA Executive Director Ricardo Ramos warned that cancellation of the contract could cause up to 12-week delay in getting electricity turned on for residents across the island . Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico more than 40 days ago , yet only about 30 percent of utility customers on the island have had their power restored .
New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo ( D ) said Sunday he plans to deploy additional utility crews and equipment to help Puerto Rico jump-start the repairs . “ It ’ s very hard to get the society up and running until you have the power restored . And there ’ s been very little progress on the power , ” Cuomo told CNN . New York previously deployed resources to Puerto Rico immediately following Hurricane Maria .
New York is deploying additional utility crews and equipment to help restore power in Puerto Rico . — Andrew Cuomo ( @ NYGovCuomo ) October 29 , 2017
Rosselló said in a press conference on Sunday that the island would coordinate with New York and Florida to reinforce electric power brigades . To further help with relief efforts , Cuomo has organized a 28-person power restoration team consisting of engineers and supervisors that specialize in the supervision of transmission and distribution system recovery . The workers , pulled from various utility companies across New York State , reportedly will be deployed in early November .
Sen. Maria Cantwell ( D-WA ) , the ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee , welcomed the decision to cancel the Whitefish Energy contract and stressed that an investigation into how the contract came about should continue . “ Taxpayers should pay a fair rate for the emergency repairs Puerto Rico desperately needs — not be gouged by Whitefish Energy or anyone else , ” Cantwell said in a statement .
PREPA ’ s contract with Whitefish Energy raised red flags soon after it was signed . The company , based in Whitefish , Montana , was was tiny two-person operation with annual revenues of only $ 1 million .
The company also appeared to have close ties to Zinke , who lives in Whitefish . Zinke and Whitefish Energy CEO Andy Techmanski have denied any wrongdoing , but both acknowledged that they have known each other for years . One of Zinke ’ s sons worked as a flagger at construction sites where Whitefish Energy was operating .
Among Whitefish Energy ’ s investors is the Dallas-based HBC Investments LLC . Joseph Colonnetta , founding and general partner of HBC , donated $ 5,400 to Donald Trump ’ s presidential campaign and $ 14,600 to the Republican National Committee through the Trump Victory fund , set up to raise money from big donors .
On Monday , the Wall Street Journal reported that the FBI is investigating PREPA ’ s contract with Whitefish Energy . FBI agents from the San Juan field office are looking into the deal , the newspaper said , citing three people familiar with the matter .
PREPA also has signed a $ 200 million contract with Cobra Acquisitions LLC to support the work on the island by Whitefish Energy to restore the main lines of transmission . Cobra , a subsidiary of Mammoth Energy Services , is based in Oklahoma .
Mammoth executives said officials with FEMA were “ involved every step of the way to make sure the contract complies with their reimbursement requirements. ” Prior to beginning any work , Mammoth received a $ 15 million up-front payment , and billing will occur twice weekly .
Mammoth spokesman Matt Wagner said the company is confident its contract with PREPA will withstand scrutiny . The subsidiary was formed last spring and currently has 275 employees .
Arty Straehla , Mammoth ’ s CEO , said on a October 20 conference call that Cobra ’ s primary clients are electric utilities and that prior to winning the Puerto Rico contract , the subsidiary had sent crews to help with recovery efforts in Texas following Hurricane Harvey and in Florida following Hurricane Irma .
The contract was completed on October 20 , and within days Cobra had a 60-person advance crew on the island starting to set up a base of operation . Over the coming weeks , more than 500 workers will be mobilized to the island to help restore the electric utility infrastructure , Cobra said in a statement .
Last week , Whitefish Energy reportedly hired a former House member to lobby on its behalf as lawmakers called for investigations into its contract with PREPA . Former Rep. Dennis Cardoza ( D-CA ) told Politico that he would “ meet people on the Hill ” to make the case that Whitefish Energy won the contract fairly .

In mid-October , Rosselló said his goal was to have 30 percent of the island ’ s power restored by the end of the month . After that , the target would be to restore 50 percent by November 15 , 80 percent by December 1 , and 95 percent by December 15 .

Why the government of Puerto Rico decided to forgo mutual aid agreements and instead signed the agreement with Whitefish Energy remains an unanswered question . “ No one in Puerto Rico , not Rosselló nor PREPA Executive Director Ricardo Ramos , has satisfactorily explained the decision to put off bringing in external crews and equipment and forego mutual aid agreements , which raises suspicions that the job had been set aside from the outset for mainland private interests , ” Armando Valdés Prieto , former director of Puerto Rico ’ s Office of Management and Budget , wrote in an op-ed published Monday in the Washington Post .
The cancellation of the contract raises many questions , Valdés Prieto wrote . How much more will Puerto Rico have to pay on top of the $ 8 million to $ 10 million PREPA said it has already been disbursed to demobilize work crews under the contract ’ s cancellation clause ? How will PREPA make up for 10- to 12-week delay that Ramos predicted could result from the termination of the contract ?","Puerto Rico’s decision to cancel its contract with Whitefish Energy Holdings LLC, a small Montana-based company with ties to the Trump administration, has thrown the island’s electricity restoration efforts into disarray.

Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) CEO Ricardo Ramos said Sunday he would move to cancel the $300 million contract with Whitefish Energy, which has drawn intense scrutiny. The cancellation comes on the heels of revelations that the contract was awarded to a company with deep ties to Trump donors and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. The contract included a clause that barred the government from reviewing the company’s profits related to its electric grid work.

While Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló contends power restoration efforts will remain on schedule, PREPA Executive Director Ricardo Ramos warned that cancellation of the contract could cause up to 12-week delay in getting electricity turned on for residents across the island. Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico more than 40 days ago, yet only about 30 percent of utility customers on the island have had their power restored.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) said Sunday he plans to deploy additional utility crews and equipment to help Puerto Rico jump-start the repairs. “It’s very hard to get the society up and running until you have the power restored. And there’s been very little progress on the power,” Cuomo told CNN. New York previously deployed resources to Puerto Rico immediately following Hurricane Maria.

Rosselló said in a press conference on Sunday that the island would coordinate with New York and Florida to reinforce electric power brigades. To further help with relief efforts, Cuomo has organized a 28-person power restoration team consisting of engineers and supervisors that specialize in the supervision of transmission and distribution system recovery. The workers, pulled from various utility companies across New York State, reportedly will be deployed in early November.

Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA), the ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, welcomed the decision to cancel the Whitefish Energy contract and stressed that an investigation into how the contract came about should continue. “Taxpayers should pay a fair rate for the emergency repairs Puerto Rico desperately needs — not be gouged by Whitefish Energy or anyone else,” Cantwell said in a statement.

PREPA’s contract with Whitefish Energy raised red flags soon after it was signed. The company, based in Whitefish, Montana, was was tiny two-person operation with annual revenues of only $1 million.

The company also appeared to have close ties to Zinke, who lives in Whitefish. Zinke and Whitefish Energy CEO Andy Techmanski have denied any wrongdoing, but both acknowledged that they have known each other for years. One of Zinke’s sons worked as a flagger at construction sites where Whitefish Energy was operating.

Among Whitefish Energy’s investors is the Dallas-based HBC Investments LLC. Joseph Colonnetta, founding and general partner of HBC, donated $5,400 to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and $14,600 to the Republican National Committee through the Trump Victory fund, set up to raise money from big donors.

On Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported that the FBI is investigating PREPA’s contract with Whitefish Energy. FBI agents from the San Juan field office are looking into the deal, the newspaper said, citing three people familiar with the matter.

PREPA also has signed a $200 million contract with Cobra Acquisitions LLC to support the work on the island by Whitefish Energy to restore the main lines of transmission. Cobra, a subsidiary of Mammoth Energy Services, is based in Oklahoma.

Mammoth executives said officials with FEMA were “involved every step of the way to make sure the contract complies with their reimbursement requirements.” Prior to beginning any work, Mammoth received a $15 million up-front payment, and billing will occur twice weekly.

Mammoth spokesman Matt Wagner said the company is confident its contract with PREPA will withstand scrutiny. The subsidiary was formed last spring and currently has 275 employees.

Arty Straehla, Mammoth’s CEO, said on a October 20 conference call that Cobra’s primary clients are electric utilities and that prior to winning the Puerto Rico contract, the subsidiary had sent crews to help with recovery efforts in Texas following Hurricane Harvey and in Florida following Hurricane Irma.

The contract was completed on October 20, and within days Cobra had a 60-person advance crew on the island starting to set up a base of operation. Over the coming weeks, more than 500 workers will be mobilized to the island to help restore the electric utility infrastructure, Cobra said in a statement.

Last week, Whitefish Energy reportedly hired a former House member to lobby on its behalf as lawmakers called for investigations into its contract with PREPA. Former Rep. Dennis Cardoza (D-CA) told Politico that he would “meet people on the Hill” to make the case that Whitefish Energy won the contract fairly.

The Sierra Club described the Whitefish Energy contract as “only the latest scandal” for the Trump administration. “Puerto Ricans need someone capable of turning on the lights which obtains its contract through an open and transparent process in order to transform the electric grid, not one mired in controversy,” Ramón Cruz, a member of the Sierra Club’s national board and former member of the Puerto Rico Energy Commission, said in a statement.

The overall decline follows a national trend that is 10 years in the making , says Tod Burke , a criminologist at Radford University in Radford , Va. “ The trend is downward . This is all good news , ” he says .
The Federal Bureau of Investigation reported Tuesday that homicides dropped nearly 7 percent in the first half of 2013 , compared with the same period a year earlier . Violent crime fell 5 percent . The greatest drop in homicides , 14.5 percent , took place in the Northeast , but other regions also reported a falloff in homicide rates : the West ( 6.9 percent ) , South ( 5.4 percent ) and Midwest ( 4.3 percent ) .
Arson was the only category represented by a double-digit decrease last year at nearly 16 percent . Burglaries fell the second most , 8 percent . Robbery ( 1.8 percent ) and motor vehicle theft ( 3.2 percent ) fell the least .
There are multiple reasons why crime rates continue to fall . One is more effective policing techniques , which incorporate technology and data to target specific areas or individuals , and are much more effective in prevention efforts .
“ It is no longer how many officers you have , it ’ s where you place them . You ’ re seeing a lot more creative policing than what was going on in the past , ” Professor Burke says .
Digital and mobile technologies are also creating more awareness and connecting the public with law enforcement more immediately . Not only can the public serve as “ the eyes and ears of the police ” via the cameras they have on their devices , but they are able to send and receive alerts immediately , which can help preventing and solving crime . “ The community becomes an extension of the police , ” he says .
Other factors include rising incarceration rates , which remove those most likely to commit crimes from the streets ; and urban removal efforts , which have improved blighted areas most likely to be havens for crime .
The FBI data are not a comprehensive representation of national crime trends , as only 272 cities report their statistics .
“ It ’ s a snapshot and we should take it as just that , ” Burke says . Besides not including every city in the US , one disadvantage is that some municipalities may , intentionally or not , have different reporting methods for classifying certain crimes .
In releasing the data , the FBI announced it was the first time that the number of rapes was based on a new definition , which it said represents a clearer picture of sexual violence .
Starting in 1927 , the FBI began collecting data on “ forcible rape , ” that is `` the carnal knowledge of a female , forcibly and against her will . '' In its latest crime report , the FBI has expanded its definition to include both genders of victim and perpetrator and a broader definition of what constitutes rape .
The difference in reporting is reflected in the numbers . Under the new definition , data show that rapes increased nearly nine percent in the first six months of 2013 , compared with the same time period the previous year . Under the old definition , the opposite was true : rape fell nearly 11 percent in 2013 .
Katie Hanna , executive director of the Ohio Alliance to End Sexual Violence in Cleveland , says that the former definition did not “ reflect the large number of victims we know , as advocates , are out there . ”
“ By including the new definition , what it says is this is a public health issue we need to take seriously , '' Ms. Hanna says , adding that the number of rape victims is likely much greater , since a large percentage of victims choose not to report the crime .","Overall reported crime was down in the first half of last year, according to new federal data from more than 270 cities that show declines in all categories except rape.

The U.S. government is pressuring Apple to unlock two phones belonging to a Saudi air force officer who went on a deadly shooting rampage at a Pensacola , Fla. , naval base in December .
Mohammed Alshamrani killed three people and injured eight others before dying in a shootout with sheriff ’ s deputies . Last week Attorney General William Barr — who called the shooting an act of terrorism — admonished Apple for refusing to unlock Alshamrani ’ s phones , which are protected by passwords . President Trump blasted the company on Twitter and called for Apple “ to step up to the plate and help our great Country , NOW ! ''
Apple has declined to open the phones but said it had helped the investigation by handing over “ many gigabytes of information ” from Alshamrani ’ s account stored on its servers .
This isn ’ t the first time Apple has butted heads with the Justice Department over access to its devices after a mass shooting . A similar issue arose over a phone belonging to one of the people behind a 2015 terrorist attack that killed 14 people in San Bernardino , Calif. A court ordered Apple to build software to unlock the phone , but the company refused . The government ultimately found outside help unlocking the phone and abandoned the case before it reached higher courts , leaving the underlying legal issues unresolved .
The government argues that Apple is standing in the way of its ability to combat terrorism by refusing to unlock the phones . “ Apple has a notorious history of siding with terrorists over law enforcement , ” Republican Sen. Tom Cotton tweeted . Barr said it was “ critical ” for the Justice Department to be able to access digital evidence in terror investigations .
Apple has maintained that it can not create a “ backdoor ” for the FBI to access an individual phone without creating a pathway that would make all iPhones vulnerable . Privacy advocates worry that an entry point created for this case could fall into the hands of criminals , hackers or rival governments .
Others have accused the Justice Department of leveraging a high-profile terrorism case to pressure Apple into developing a tool it can use , or abuse , whenever it likes .
Apple appears committed to defying the FBI ’ s request , which may lead to another protracted legal battle . Some lawmakers have suggested that Congress may pursue legislation to mandate that technology companies comply with government demands for access to devices .
“ By choosing privacy for all citizens , we also allow privacy to criminals . Law enforcement today relies on a hodgepodge of methods that try to go around end-to-end encryption , allowing sophisticated criminals freedom of action. ” — Security expert Daniel Goldberg to Washington Examiner

What’s happening

The U.S. government is pressuring Apple to unlock two phones belonging to a Saudi air force officer who went on a deadly shooting rampage at a Pensacola, Fla., naval base in December.

Mohammed Alshamrani killed three people and injured eight others before dying in a shootout with sheriff’s deputies. Last week Attorney General William Barr — who called the shooting an act of terrorism — admonished Apple for refusing to unlock Alshamrani’s phones, which are protected by passwords. President Trump blasted the company on Twitter and called for Apple “to step up to the plate and help our great Country, NOW!""

Apple has declined to open the phones but said it had helped the investigation by handing over “many gigabytes of information” from Alshamrani’s account stored on its servers.

This isn’t the first time Apple has butted heads with the Justice Department over access to its devices after a mass shooting. A similar issue arose over a phone belonging to one of the people behind a 2015 terrorist attack that killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif. A court ordered Apple to build software to unlock the phone, but the company refused. The government ultimately found outside help unlocking the phone and abandoned the case before it reached higher courts, leaving the underlying legal issues unresolved.

Why there’s debate

The government argues that Apple is standing in the way of its ability to combat terrorism by refusing to unlock the phones. “Apple has a notorious history of siding with terrorists over law enforcement,” Republican Sen. Tom Cotton tweeted. Barr said it was “critical” for the Justice Department to be able to access digital evidence in terror investigations.

Apple has maintained that it cannot create a “backdoor” for the FBI to access an individual phone without creating a pathway that would make all iPhones vulnerable. Privacy advocates worry that an entry point created for this case could fall into the hands of criminals, hackers or rival governments.

Others have accused the Justice Department of leveraging a high-profile terrorism case to pressure Apple into developing a tool it can use, or abuse, whenever it likes.

What’s next

Apple appears committed to defying the FBI’s request, which may lead to another protracted legal battle. Some lawmakers have suggested that Congress may pursue legislation to mandate that technology companies comply with government demands for access to devices.

Protecting user privacy makes law enforcement’s job more difficult

“By choosing privacy for all citizens, we also allow privacy to criminals. Law enforcement today relies on a hodgepodge of methods that try to go around end-to-end encryption, allowing sophisticated criminals freedom of action.” — Security expert Daniel Goldberg to Washington Examiner

WASHINGTON - The second woman who came forward with sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh has been contacted by the FBI, her attorney told USA TODAY.

Deborah Ramirez claimed Kavanaugh exposed himself to her and shoved his penis in her face at a dorm party while they were students at Yale University. Her allegations first appeared in the New Yorker.

Kavanaugh denies these allegations and others that have been lodged against him.

Her attorney, John Clune, said Ramirez is cooperating with the FBI as agents investigate the batch of allegations in Kavanaugh's reopened background check.

""We can confirm the FBI has reached out to interview Ms. Ramirez and she has agreed to cooperate with their investigation,"" Clune said in a statement. ""Out of respect for the integrity of the process, we will have no further comment at this time.""

The FBI investigation was ordered by President Donald Trump Friday after Sen. Jeff Flake, R-AZ., a key deciding vote for Republicans, said he would only confirm Kavanaugh in the if the investigation was done.

The FBI was given a week to reexamine Kavanaugh's background and investigate the batch of claims, but even in that small window former FBI officials said agents could reach a quick resolution.

""They could knock this thing out in a couple of days,"" said Jim Davis, a former agent who participated in at least 50 such background inquiries. ""The great and beautiful thing about the FBI is that it can apply incredible resources to whatever the issue requires.""

Griffiths, Matthew Nussbaum","Trump-Putin meeting Trump publicly sides with Putin on election interference The president said he doesn ’ t ‘ see any reason ’ why Russia would have wanted to hack Democratic Party servers .
President Donald Trump on Monday publicly sided with Russian President Vladimir Putin over his own intelligence agencies , refusing to condemn the Kremlin for interference in the 2016 election and saying that “ I don ’ t see any reason ” why Russia would have hacked Democratic computer servers .
Trump ’ s remarkable statements , during a joint news conference in Helsinki , Finland , after holding a two-hour one-on-one meeting with Putin , came after special counsel Robert Mueller indicted 12 Russians on Friday over allegations of involvement in the state-ordered election-interference operation .
Trump repeatedly attacked the FBI , praised Putin as a “ good competitor , ” refused to say Russia was accountable for any aspects of fraying U.S.-Russia relations , and attacked Mueller ’ s inquiry as “ a disaster for our country . ”
Putin , for his part , denied that Russia interfered in the U.S election , though he declared that he did want Trump to win the 2016 presidential election .
While Trump seemed ready to take Putin 's word over that of his own intelligence chiefs on the question of Russian election meddling , Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats was quick to counter the U.S. president , issuing a statement that the U.S. intelligence community has `` been clear in our assessments of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and their ongoing , pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy , and we will continue to provide unvarnished and objective intelligence in support of our national security . ''
The president 's remarks towards Putin and Russia , as well as the overall congenial tone , drew a swift rebuke not just from Democrats but also from Republicans , including some in GOP leadership who have otherwise been allies and defenders of Trump . In a statement issued Monday , House Speaker Paul Ryan said that `` the president must appreciate that Russia is not our ally '' and that `` there is no moral equivalence between the United States and Russia , which remains hostile to our most basic values and ideals . ''
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker , who had expressed reservations about the Helsinki summit and has clashed regularly and loudly with Trump , told reporters Monday that `` I did not think this was a good moment for our country '' and that `` the president 's comments made us look as a nation more like a pushover . '' Of Putin , Corker said `` I would guess he 's having caviar right now . ''
Throughout the 45-minute news conference , Trump made his admiration of Putin clear .
“ Our relationship has never been worse than it is now ; however , that changed as of about four hours ago , I really believe that , ” Trump declared . “ Today ’ s meeting is only the beginning of a longer process . But we have taken the first steps toward a brighter future . ”
Trump was directly asked at one point whether he believed the U.S. intelligence agencies , which concluded Russia carried out the hacking of Democratic servers to help Trump , or Putin , who has said it did not . Trump acknowledged that his own intelligence chiefs “ think it ’ s Russia . ”
“ I have President Putin , he just said it ’ s not Russia , ” Trump went on . “ I will say this : I don ’ t see any reason why it would be . But I really do want to see the server . But I have confidence in both parties . ”
The news conference left observers gobsmacked , as Trump — who delights in flaying opponents and perceived opponents , and has made a habit of attacking American allies — refused to say a single negative word about Russia and used the international stage to praise the country ’ s strongman leader and attack American institutions .
“ Donald Trump ’ s press conference performance in Helsinki rises to & exceeds the threshold of ‘ high crimes & misdemeanors , ’ ” former CIA director John Brennan wrote on Twitter . “ It was nothing short of treasonous . Not only were Trump ’ s comments imbecilic , he is wholly in the pocket of Putin . Republican Patriots : Where are you ? ? ? ”
Republican Sen. Jeff Flake called the appearance “ shameful. ” Former GOP Sen. Chuck Hagel , who served as secretary of defense under former President Barack Obama , told CNN that `` President Trump failed America today . He failed America , our interests , in every way . ''
Perhaps the harshest criticism came from Sen. John McCain , the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee who has been among the GOP 's most open critics of the president . McCain , a POW during the Vietnam War whom Trump once suggested was not a war hero because he had been captured , called the president 's meeting in Helsinki `` one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory . ''
`` The damage inflicted by President Trump ’ s naiveté , egotism , false equivalence , and sympathy for autocrats is difficult to calculate . But it is clear that the summit in Helsinki was a tragic mistake , '' McCain , who has been away from the Senate for months as he undergoes cancer treatment , said in a statement . `` No prior president has ever abased himself more abjectly before a tyrant . ''
In a flurry of posts to Twitter , Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer questioned `` what could possibly cause @ realDonaldTrump to put the interests of Russia over those of the United States '' and suggested that the president 's performance on Monday would fuel speculation that the Kremlin is in possession of compromising information regarding Trump .
`` Millions of Americans will continue to wonder if the only possible explanation for this dangerous behavior is the possibility that President Putin holds damaging information over President Trump , '' Schumer wrote online , seemingly alluding to a salacious but unverified dossier of intelligence compiled by a former British intelligence agent , who alleged that the Kremlin possesses video footage of the president engaging in lewd acts with prostitutes in a Moscow hotel room .
After he departed Helsinki , Trump appeared to try to shore up the intelligence community , after publicly refusing to back their assessment . `` As I said today and many times before , ' I have GREAT confidence in MY intelligence people . ' '' Trump tweeted . `` However , I also recognize that in order to build a brighter future , we can not exclusively focus on the past – as the world ’ s two largest nuclear powers , we must get along ! ''
Later Monday evening , Trump returned to his charges about the Mueller probe . The president said he was intrigued by Putin 's offer to welcome Mueller 's prosecutors into Russia to investigate the allegations laid out against 12 members of Russian intelligence , but said the special counsel 's team would never go for it .
`` 13 angry Democrats , you think they are going to want to go ? , '' Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity in an interview aired Monday night . `` I do n't think so . ''
To Hannity , Trump repeated his claims that the probe has hurt his ability to conduct foreign policy , especially with Russia . He added some of the individuals who have become ensnared in the investigation , including his former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign manager Paul Manafort , have been treated very unfairly .
`` With Paul Manafort , who clearly is a nice man , '' Trump said , `` you look at what is going on with him . It 's like Al Capone . ''
Coming just days after Trump castigated NATO allies in Belgium and called the European Union a “ foe , ” the summit with Putin offered the clearest display yet of Trump ’ s eagerness to forge a bond with a country that is clashing with the U.S. and its allies on issues that span the globe .
Asked at one point if he held Russia accountable for any aspects of the charged relations between the two countries , Trump demurred .
“ I hold both countries responsible , ” he said . “ I think that the United States has been foolish , I think that we ’ ve all been foolish . ”
He quickly turned his ire on the special counsel probe and declared that he ran a “ clean campaign ” in defeating Hillary Clinton and that there was “ zero collusion ” between his campaign and Russia .
When Putin was then asked by a reporter why Americans should trust his denials , Trump jumped in to again say that “ there was no collusion . ”
“ You can trust no one , ” Putin said , before falsely declaring that “ there ’ s no evidence ” that Russia was involved in the interference .
Hours after Trump 's news conference had concluded , and in the thick of the uproar it created in the the U.S. and beyond , the Justice Department announced it had charged Maria Butina , a 29-year-old Russian citizen living in Washington , with conspiracy to act as an agent of the Kremlin without registering as such .
In a statement , the Justice Department said Butina was arrested Sunday and appeared in court Monday . Charges against her were announced by the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia — not Mueller 's office — in conjunction with the assistant attorney general for national security and the FBI 's assistant director in charge of the bureau 's Washington field office .
Trump and Putin met at the Presidential Palace in Helsinki , at first appearing tense and subdued and initially forgoing a handshake as they appeared together before sitting down for the highly anticipated one-on-one meeting .
“ I think we have great opportunities together as two countries that , frankly , we have not been getting along very well for the last number of years , ” Trump said as he sat beside Putin before an array of Russian and American flags prior to their one-on-one meeting . “ But I think we will end up having an extraordinary relationship . I hope so . ”
The president then repeated what has become something of a mantra as he pursues warmer relations with Moscow : “ Getting along with Russia is a good thing , not a bad thing . ”
Putin , in his own remarks , said that he looked forward to a discussion “ about our bilateral relationship and problem points in the world . ”
Trump made no mention in his opening remarks of Russia ’ s election interference , nor of other areas where the country has been seen as an aggressor , such as Ukraine , Syria and Britain .
The summit came at an extraordinary moment , just days after Mueller indicted 12 Russians for their roles in hacking Democratic Party computer systems as part of the interference campaign .
Those indictments were just the latest in Mueller ’ s inquiry , which Trump continues to dismiss as a “ witch hunt. ” Mueller has so far brought indictments against 32 people , including Trump ’ s former campaign manager Paul Manafort , who is in jail after having his bail revoked over allegations that he sought to tamper with witnesses , and Trump ’ s former national security adviser Michael Flynn , who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI .
The investigation has not yet determined whether Trump ’ s campaign colluded with Russia in the interference effort , something that Trump has repeatedly denied . Moscow is also on the defensive over allegations that it was involved in nerve-agent poisonings in England targeting a former KGB agent that have left at least one British civilian dead .
There also remain the issues of the Syrian civil war , where Putin has backed the President Bashar Al Assad as his government has carried out atrocities against civilians , and Ukraine , where Russia-backed rebels continue to resist the government in Kiev .
Trump in the past has been wary of challenging Putin on Russian aggression abroad , including the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine , and has repeatedly stressed his desire for a warm relationship with Moscow .
Before Trump had breakfast with Finland President Sauli Niinistö , on Monday , reporters asked him what he would say to Putin . “ We ’ ll do just fine , ” Trump responded .
Hours before the day ’ s events , the president took to Twitter to blame the United States and the investigation of Russian interference — not the interference itself — for chilly relations between Washington and Moscow . It was an extraordinary attack from an American president on both his predecessor and American institutions upholding domestic law and order .
“ Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now , the Rigged Witch Hunt ! ” Trump tweeted , deploying his favorite derogatory nickname for Mueller ’ s sprawling investigation .
That move — to blame the United States for poor relations , and to attack the investigation of election interference but not the interference itself — was welcomed by Russia .
Moments before Putin and Trump sat down to meet , the Russian Foreign Ministry tweeted out Trump ’ s pronouncement with a simple addition : “ We agree . ”
The declaration of American “ foolishness and stupidity ” was not Trump ’ s only pre-meeting message .
“ President Obama thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election , so when he was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling , he said it couldn ’ t happen , was no big deal , & did NOTHING about it . When I won it became a big deal and the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by Strzok ! ” the president wrote earlier in the morning , referring to Agent Peter Strzok , who has come under criticism for personal texts he sent that were critical of Trump .
The broadsides were nothing new for the president , who has long railed against the investigation and questioned the intelligence community ’ s conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to aid his chances of winning .
The president has repeated Putin ’ s claim that Moscow had nothing to do with the hacking , after past meetings with the Russian leader . The Helsinki summit will be their first formal one-on-one gathering and comes after Trump caused controversy last week at a NATO summit and in meetings in Britain .
The president rehashed the NATO summit on Twitter on Monday , declaring it a success even after he spent much of the gathering berating allies for not spending enough on defense .
“ Received many calls from leaders of NATO countries thanking me for helping to bring them together and to get them focused on financial obligations , both present & future , ” Trump tweeted . “ We had a truly great Summit that was inaccurately covered by much of the media . NATO is now strong & rich !

When Putin was then asked by a reporter why Americans should trust his denials, Trump jumped in to again say that “there was no collusion.”

“You can trust no one,” Putin said, before falsely declaring that “there’s no evidence” that Russia was involved in the interference.

Hours after Trump's news conference had concluded, and in the thick of the uproar it created in the the U.S. and beyond, the Justice Department announced it had charged Maria Butina, a 29-year-old Russian citizen living in Washington, with conspiracy to act as an agent of the Kremlin without registering as such.

In a statement, the Justice Department said Butina was arrested Sunday and appeared in court Monday. Charges against her were announced by the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia — not Mueller's office — in conjunction with the assistant attorney general for national security and the FBI's assistant director in charge of the bureau's Washington field office.

Trump and Putin met at the Presidential Palace in Helsinki, at first appearing tense and subdued and initially forgoing a handshake as they appeared together before sitting down for the highly anticipated one-on-one meeting.

“I think we have great opportunities together as two countries that, frankly, we have not been getting along very well for the last number of years,” Trump said as he sat beside Putin before an array of Russian and American flags prior to their one-on-one meeting. “But I think we will end up having an extraordinary relationship. I hope so.”

The president then repeated what has become something of a mantra as he pursues warmer relations with Moscow: “Getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing.”

Putin, in his own remarks, said that he looked forward to a discussion “about our bilateral relationship and problem points in the world.”

Trump made no mention in his opening remarks of Russia’s election interference, nor of other areas where the country has been seen as an aggressor, such as Ukraine, Syria and Britain.

The summit came at an extraordinary moment, just days after Mueller indicted 12 Russians for their roles in hacking Democratic Party computer systems as part of the interference campaign.

Those indictments were just the latest in Mueller’s inquiry, which Trump continues to dismiss as a “witch hunt.” Mueller has so far brought indictments against 32 people, including Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort, who is in jail after having his bail revoked over allegations that he sought to tamper with witnesses, and Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.

The investigation has not yet determined whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia in the interference effort, something that Trump has repeatedly denied. Moscow is also on the defensive over allegations that it was involved in nerve-agent poisonings in England targeting a former KGB agent that have left at least one British civilian dead.

There also remain the issues of the Syrian civil war, where Putin has backed the President Bashar Al Assad as his government has carried out atrocities against civilians, and Ukraine, where Russia-backed rebels continue to resist the government in Kiev.

Trump in the past has been wary of challenging Putin on Russian aggression abroad, including the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, and has repeatedly stressed his desire for a warm relationship with Moscow.

Before Trump had breakfast with Finland President Sauli Niinistö, on Monday, reporters asked him what he would say to Putin. “We’ll do just fine,” Trump responded.

Hours before the day’s events, the president took to Twitter to blame the United States and the investigation of Russian interference — not the interference itself — for chilly relations between Washington and Moscow. It was an extraordinary attack from an American president on both his predecessor and American institutions upholding domestic law and order.

“Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!” Trump tweeted, deploying his favorite derogatory nickname for Mueller’s sprawling investigation.

That move — to blame the United States for poor relations, and to attack the investigation of election interference but not the interference itself — was welcomed by Russia.

Moments before Putin and Trump sat down to meet, the Russian Foreign Ministry tweeted out Trump’s pronouncement with a simple addition: “We agree.”

The declaration of American “foolishness and stupidity” was not Trump’s only pre-meeting message.

“President Obama thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election, so when he was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldn’t happen, was no big deal, & did NOTHING about it. When I won it became a big deal and the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by Strzok!” the president wrote earlier in the morning, referring to Agent Peter Strzok, who has come under criticism for personal texts he sent that were critical of Trump.

The broadsides were nothing new for the president, who has long railed against the investigation and questioned the intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to aid his chances of winning.

The president has repeated Putin’s claim that Moscow had nothing to do with the hacking, after past meetings with the Russian leader. The Helsinki summit will be their first formal one-on-one gathering and comes after Trump caused controversy last week at a NATO summit and in meetings in Britain.

The president rehashed the NATO summit on Twitter on Monday, declaring it a success even after he spent much of the gathering berating allies for not spending enough on defense.

“Received many calls from leaders of NATO countries thanking me for helping to bring them together and to get them focused on financial obligations, both present & future,” Trump tweeted. “We had a truly great Summit that was inaccurately covered by much of the media. NATO is now strong & rich!""

Of all the endlessly competing theories for the shocking outcome of the 2016 presidential election, two have always struck me as the most credible. The first is that general overconfidence in a Clinton victory led her campaign to make a series of strategic errors (e.g, putting resources into states like Arizona and Georgia while shirking the “Clinton firewall” states that eventually swung the electoral college to Donald Trump) while convincing many of her potential voters that it was safe to stay home on Election Day. The second is that James Comey’s highly public insertion of the Clinton email issue into the media bloodstream on two occasions late in the contest hurt her decisively among swing voters and obscured the Access Hollywood scandal that had put the spotlight on Trump in a very damaging way.

Now the two competing explanations are beginning to converge.

As Comey confesses in his new book (and in this segment from his forthcoming ABC News interview), his own assumption that Clinton was a lock to win had a big impact on how he handled disclosure of the last-minute email “story”:

It is entirely possible that, because I was making decisions in an environment where Hillary Clinton was sure to be the next president, my concern about making her an illegitimate president by concealing the restarted investigation bore greater weight than it would have if the election appeared closer or if Donald Trump were ahead in all polls.

And as New York’s Jonathan Chait recently reminded us, Comey’s political assumption was widely shared throughout the FBI. In the absence of a competitive election, Chait argues, Comey concluded that heading off a future conspiracy theory was a reasonable thing to do:

In Comey’s mind, bending procedure and announcing he was investigating a candidate was an acceptable price to pay to avoid the opposite: years of hearings and delegitimization that would surely follow Clinton’s expected election.

The belief that Clinton couldn’t lose is the only way to make sense of what a lot of people said and did in October 2016. But most of them did not have as much power to derail her campaign as Comey.

The story is disputed : Comey ’ s side of it comes from secondhand sources .

Rosenstein also criticized the pundit class for putting a political spin on every decision he made .

GOP lawmakers concluded this after grilling FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe on December 21 , behind closed doors , according to John Solomon ’ s molar-grinding exposé in Tuesday ’ s The Hill .
“ For the first time , investigators say they have secured written evidence that the FBI believed there was evidence that some laws were broken , ” Solomon reported . This proof includes what Solomon calls revelations of “ irregularities and contradictions ” in the FBI ’ s inquiry .
‐ Former FBI director James Comey ’ s first draft of his statement exonerating Hillary Clinton was dated May 2 , 2016 . But FBI agents on this case still were collecting subpoenaed documents and other relevant evidence . They cataloged additional exhibits on May 13 , 19 , and 26 .
‐ Comey wrote his “ Free Hillary ! ” speech before 12 to 17 separate witnesses had been questioned , including Hillary herself . She was not interrogated until July 2 — fully two months after Comey penned remarks that kept her out of jail . He publicly delivered his words of absolution that July 5 , in a widely covered press conference .
‐ Comey ’ s May 2 , 2016 , draft reportedly declared , “ The sheer volume of information that was properly classified as Secret at the time it was discussed on email ( that is , excluding the ‘ up classified ’ emails ) supports an inference that the participants were grossly negligent in their handling of that information . ”
‐ Hillary is only human . Even her critics might excuse a couple of goof-ups in which she accidentally exposed a classified record or two . However , Hillary operated a busted water main of classified data that flowed in from State and then gushed out of her lawless , do-it-yourself server . These 113 “ born classified ” records included eight Top Secret emails , ten Confidential ones , and 37 Secret messages .
‐ Comey ’ s first draft correctly called this behavior “ grossly negligent. ” That precise legal standard should have triggered Hillary ’ s prosecution under the Espionage Act of 1917 , 18 U.S. Code § 793 . Luckily for her and her comrades , Peter Strzok — a disgraced , vociferously anti-Trump and volubly pro-Hillary FBI official — excised those words and inserted “ extremely careless , ” language absent from that statute .

It was a veritable spa of special treatment.

The FBI did everything but drive Hillary’s getaway car.

Former secretary of state Clinton is a free woman largely thanks to the tender loving care that the FBI provided her and her conspirators during its probe of her illegal, unsecure email server and related abuse of government secrets. GOP lawmakers concluded this after grilling FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe on December 21, behind closed doors, according to John Solomon’s molar-grinding exposé in Tuesday’s The Hill.

“For the first time, investigators say they have secured written evidence that the FBI believed there was evidence that some laws were broken,” Solomon reported. This proof includes what Solomon calls revelations of “irregularities and contradictions” in the FBI’s inquiry.

‐ Former FBI director James Comey’s first draft of his statement exonerating Hillary Clinton was dated May 2, 2016. But FBI agents on this case still were collecting subpoenaed documents and other relevant evidence. They cataloged additional exhibits on May 13, 19, and 26.

‐ Comey wrote his “Free Hillary!” speech before 12 to 17 separate witnesses had been questioned, including Hillary herself. She was not interrogated until July 2 — fully two months after Comey penned remarks that kept her out of jail. He publicly delivered his words of absolution that July 5, in a widely covered press conference.

‐ Comey’s May 2, 2016, draft reportedly declared, “The sheer volume of information that was properly classified as Secret at the time it was discussed on email (that is, excluding the ‘up classified’ emails) supports an inference that the participants were grossly negligent in their handling of that information.”

‐ Hillary is only human. Even her critics might excuse a couple of goof-ups in which she accidentally exposed a classified record or two. However, Hillary operated a busted water main of classified data that flowed in from State and then gushed out of her lawless, do-it-yourself server. These 113 “born classified” records included eight Top Secret emails, ten Confidential ones, and 37 Secret messages.

‐ Comey’s first draft correctly called this behavior “grossly negligent.” That precise legal standard should have triggered Hillary’s prosecution under the Espionage Act of 1917, 18 U.S. Code § 793. Luckily for her and her comrades, Peter Strzok — a disgraced, vociferously anti-Trump and volubly pro-Hillary FBI official — excised those words and inserted “extremely careless,” language absent from that statute. This removed the pesky formulation and helped Hillary sway voters rather than federal jurors.

“You have a conference call with Secretary Clinton’s attorneys on March 31, 2015, and on that very same day her emails are deleted by someone who was on that conference call using special BleachBit software,” Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley (R., Iowa) said on the Senate floor. “The emails were State Department records under subpoena by Congress,” as of that March 25.

“What did the FBI do to investigate this apparent obstruction?” Grassley wondered. “According to affidavits filed in federal court — absolutely nothing.”

According to Judicial Watch, whose Freedom of Information Act lawsuit liberated State documents, “at least 18 classified e-mails” migrated from the State Department’s secured computers to Hillary’s illegal server to the laptop that Abedin shared with her ex-husband, imprisoned pedophile Anthony Weiner, a former Democratic congressman from Brooklyn. “This classified material includes discussions about Saudi Arabia, The Hague, Egypt, South Africa, Zimbabwe, the identity of a CIA official, Malawi, the war in Syria, Lebanon, Hamas, and the PLO,” a Judicial Watch news release noted on Thursday.

Donald Trump plans to nominate Christopher Wray to be the next director of the FBI , he announced on Twitter on Wednesday .
Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) I will be nominating Christopher A. Wray , a man of impeccable credentials , to be the new Director of the FBI . Details to follow .
The announcement comes nearly one month after Trump fired FBI director James Comey – one of the most controversial decisions of his young presidency – and just one day before Comey is scheduled to testify before the Senate intelligence committee .
During the hearing , Comey is expected to be asked about Trump ’ s attempts to soft-pedal the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn ’ s contacts with Russia .
Trump has indicated that the FBI ’ s investigation into Russia ’ s meddling in the 2016 elections and links to his campaign made up part of his thinking when he dismissed the director .

In the tweet , Trump called Wray – whose name emerged as one of those in the frame on 31 May – “ a man of impeccable credentials ” . An FBI director must be confirmed by the Senate and typically serves a single , 10-year term .
Hours after Trump ’ s morning tweet , the White House issued a formal statement on the president ’ s selection .
“ I am proud to announce Christopher as my choice as the director of the FBI , ” Trump said in the statement .
“ He is an impeccably qualified individual , and I know that he will again serve his country as a fierce guardian of the law and model of integrity once the Senate confirms him to lead the FBI . ”
During a visit to Cincinnati , Ohio , on Wednesday , Trump remarked briefly on his decision , telling the traveling press : “ He ’ s gon na be great . ”
Wray called his selection a “ great honor ” and said : “ I look forward to serving the American people with integrity as the leader of what I know firsthand to be an extraordinary group of men and women who have dedicated their careers to protecting this country . ”
Wray , 50 , was the assistant attorney general overseeing the criminal division under George W Bush , in charge of investigations into corporate fraud .

Wray more recently represented the New Jersey governor , Chris Christie , during the investigation into the George Washington Bridge lane-closing case , in which two of Christie ’ s former aides were convicted of plotting to close lanes of the bridge to punish a Democratic mayor who would not endorse the governor . Christie , who has informally advised the president , was not charged in the case .
“ I have the utmost confidence in Chris , ” Christie told the Bergen Record last week . “ He ’ s an outstanding lawyer . He has absolute integrity and honesty , and I think that the president certainly would not be making a mistake if he asked Chris Wray to be FBI director , ” Christie said Thursday .
Christie , who remains a loyal supporter of Trump and served briefly as head of the transition team before being edged out , would not tell the paper whether he had any involvement in the president ’ s decision to consider Wray .
Wray works as a litigation partner at King and Spalding , an Atlanta-based law firm , where he oversees the company ’ s government investigations practice , representing a number of Fortune 100 financial institutions . The unit represents companies and clients in a variety of white-collar criminal and regulatory enforcement matters .
An archived search of his company biography revealed that as early as November 2016 Wray ’ s profile listed as one of his clients “ an energy company president in a criminal investigation by Russian authorities ” .
Prior to joining the firm , Wray served from 2003 to 2005 as assistant attorney general in charge of the US Department of Justice ’ s criminal division under Comey , then the US deputy attorney general . The Senate confirmed Wray to that post by unanimous consent – a feat that may be difficult to achieve again amid the current polarization in the chamber .
Wray began his legal career in private practice . In 1997 , he joined the US attorney ’ s office for the northern district of Georgia as a federal prosecutor before joining the leadership ranks at the justice department in 2001 , months before the September 11 attacks would reshape law enforcement response to terrorism .
According to his biography , Wray played an pivotal role in the department ’ s response to the 9/11 attacks , overseeing legal and operational actions in the continuing war on terrorism . He also served as a member of the Bush administration ’ s corporate fraud taskforce and led the fraud investigation of Enron Corp .
Wray graduated from Yale University in 1989 and Yale Law School in 1992 , where he served as executive director of the Yale Law Journal .
Trump ’ s announcement took lawmakers in Washington by surprise . Trump did not consult the two highest ranking members of the Senate judiciary committee before announcing his decision to pick Wray . A spokesman for the Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley , the committee ’ s chairman , said he had learned about the decision as everyone else had : on Twitter .
Diane Feinstein , the top Democrat on the committee , told reporters she too learned about Wray from Trump ’ s tweet and needed more time to review his background before commenting .
The House speaker , Paul Ryan , also said the president hadn ’ t consulted him before making the announcement .
Wray - right ? I don ’ t know the guy ... but he seems like the perfect kind of person House Speaker Paul Ryan
“ Wray – right ? ” Ryan asked in reply to a reporter ’ s question . “ I don ’ t know the guy . But I ’ ve looked at his résumé [ and ] he seems like the perfect kind of person . I thought we should have a career person take over the FBI , someone with a deep bench of experience . He certainly seems to fit that bill . ”
Senator Patrick Leahy , a Democrat from Vermont and a member of the judiciary committee , said in a statement that he was “ particularly interested ” in Wray ’ s ability to maintain the independence of his agency in light of reports that Trump attempted to pressure his FBI director into curtailing an investigation into his national security adviser .
“ For obvious reasons that could not be clearer right now , ” Leahy said in a statement , “ Mr Wray ’ s ability , willingness and commitment to be independent of the White House and presidential pressure is the threshold hurdle , and a cardinal test . ”
But US attorney general Jeff Sessions congratulated the president on his nomination of Wray , who he called a “ leader of proven skill , independence , and integrity , a man in whom all Americans can have confidence ” . Sessions said the former justice department official “ combines a brilliant legal mind , outstanding accomplishments , and a proven record of public service ” , adding that he Wray had “ tremendous ” respect for the FBI and in turn , the agents he worked with at the agency “ enthusiastically affirm his leadership and integrity ” .
Sessions recused himself from the FBI investigation into Trump associates ’ contacts with Russia after it was revealed that he had failed to disclose meetings with the Russian ambassador .
It was reported on Tuesday that Sessions offered to resign amid escalating tensions with the president , who apparently believes his attorney general should not have recused himself from the investigation .
In an early signal of possible conflicts of interest senators are likely to pursue during Wray ’ s confirmation hearing , the ACLU flagged parts of his professional background that the group said raised questions about his ability to lead the FBI with the “ independence , even-handed judgment and commitment to the rule of law that the agency deserves ” .
“ Given that Wray touts his deep involvement in the Bush administration ’ s response to the 9/11 attacks , which includes his connections to some of the most unlawful legal memos on Bush-era torture programs , the Senate should press Wray to come clean about his role in the programs , ” said Faiz Shakir , the national political director for the ACLU .
The group also raised potential conflicts of interest over the fact that Wray ’ s law firm has advised Trump ’ s family trust and his history of donating to Republican candidates and causes .
“ In this important moment for our country , the American people deserve a commitment from any nominee for FBI director to the foundational principles of our constitution , and that that commitment outweighs any loyalty to a political party or a single politician . We will be watching closely in the coming days to ensure Wray makes these commitments and earns the trust of the public . ”","After firing James Comey, president calls Wray a ‘man of impeccable credentials’ as Paul Ryan says: ‘I don’t know the guy’

The indictment filed Friday charges Mr. Manafort and Konstantin Kilimnik—a 48-year-old Moscow resident who worked for Mr. Manafort ’ s lobbying firm in Ukraine—with conspiracy to obstruct justice and obstruction of justice . Messrs. Manafort and Kilimnik are alleged to have “ knowingly and intentionally ” sought this year to influence the testimony of two unnamed witnesses who could be called to testify at Mr. Manafort ’ s trial set for September in Washington .
In a previous court filing , the office of the special counsel , Robert Mueller , has said Mr. Kilimnik is a former Russian spy , according to another Manafort associate who is now cooperating in the investigation , Richard Gates .
Mr. Manafort ’ s spokesman , Jason Maloni , didn ’ t immediately respond to emails seeking comment . Mr. Kilimnik couldn ’ t be reached . He has previously denied any ties to Russian intelligence .
In court papers filed late Friday , Mr. Manafort ’ s legal team argued the special counsel hadn ’ t established that the former Trump campaign chairman had tampered with any witnesses . “ The Special Counsel contrives dubious allegations , ” the lawyers wrote , adding that Mr. Mueller ’ s prosecutors were engaging in “ heavy-handed gamesmanship . ”

The indictment filed Friday charges Mr. Manafort and Konstantin Kilimnik—a 48-year-old Moscow resident who worked for Mr. Manafort’s lobbying firm in Ukraine—with conspiracy to obstruct justice and obstruction of justice. Messrs. Manafort and Kilimnik are alleged to have “knowingly and intentionally” sought this year to influence the testimony of two unnamed witnesses who could be called to testify at Mr. Manafort’s trial set for September in Washington.

In a previous court filing, the office of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, has said Mr. Kilimnik is a former Russian spy, according to another Manafort associate who is now cooperating in the investigation, Richard Gates.

Mr. Manafort’s spokesman, Jason Maloni, didn’t immediately respond to emails seeking comment. Mr. Kilimnik couldn’t be reached. He has previously denied any ties to Russian intelligence.

In court papers filed late Friday, Mr. Manafort’s legal team argued the special counsel hadn’t established that the former Trump campaign chairman had tampered with any witnesses. “The Special Counsel contrives dubious allegations,” the lawyers wrote, adding that Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors were engaging in “heavy-handed gamesmanship.”

“Mr. Manafort asked no one to provide a false affidavit or false testimony at trial, or perjure themselves,” the attorneys wrote, “and he has not given—nor offered to give—any potential witness anything in exchange for false testimony.”

Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz , in a voluminous report , singled out as troubling Mr. Strzok ’ s decision to move quickly from working on Hillary Clinton ’ s email case to investigating Mr. Trump .
“ In assessing Strzok ’ s decision to prioritize the Russia investigation … these text messages led us to conclude that we did not have confidence that Strzok ’ s decision was free from bias , ” Mr. Horowitz wrote .

The FBI agent , who was demoted from counterintelligence to FBI human resources , claimed the comment was innocent . Republicans have wondered whether the “ insurance policy ” statement referred to the unproven dossier or the investigation itself .
Said Mr. Horowitz : “ Strzok said the reference in his text message to an ‘ insurance policy ’ reflected his conclusion that the FBI should investigate the allegations thoroughly right away , as if Trump were going to win . ”
How Mr. Strzok conducted the Trump investigation was influenced by news media indications that Mrs. Clinton was sure to win .
The inspector general said : “ As part of this discussion , the team debated how aggressive to be and whether to use overt investigative methods .

Mr. Strzok also downplayed his most explosive message — that Mr. Trump would not become president because “ We ’ ll stop it . ”
“ When asked about this text message , ” the Horowitz report said , “ Strzok stated that he did not specifically recall sending it , but that he believed that it was intended to reassure Page that Trump would not be elected , not to suggest that he would do something to impact the investigation .

Mr. Strzok said that if he wanted to affect the outcome , then he could have leaked the Russia investigation to news media .

From July to November 2016 , Mr. Strzok ramped up the Trump case by using the dossier to obtain warrants and guide the investigation . Fired FBI Director James B.

WASHINGTON — Former FBI director James Comey will soon testify in open session before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, following revelations Friday that President Trump told Russian leaders that Comey is a ""nut job"" who was adding pressure to the high-stakes investigation of possible interference in the 2016 election.

Comey, abruptly fired by Trump last week, has agreed to testify in public sometime after Memorial Day, the committee said in a statement.

The Times, citing a report on the meeting a source read to them, said that Trump told the Russians: “I just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job ... I faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off.” The president also reportedly said: “I’m not under investigation.”

The news said the documents that included the president's comments were based on notes taken from inside the Oval Office and have been circulated as the official account of the May 10 meeting. The report says one official read quotations to The Times, and a second official confirmed the broad outlines of the discussion. Other news reports also said that, during that same meeting, Trump discussed classified counter-terrorism information with the Russians.

Democrats said the new stories underscore their belief that Trump fired Comey in order to shut down the Russia probe. ""If there was any question as to why Comey was really fired, @realDonaldTrump just answered it. As I said, Nixonian,"" said Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa.

CNN reported that at one point during the 2016 campaign, Russian officials bragged in conversations that they had cultivated a strong relationship with Flynn and believed they could use him to influence Donald Trump and his team.

Citing two unidentified sources, CNN also reported that White House lawyers have begun researching impeachment procedures in an effort to prepare for what officials still believe is a distant possibility that Trump could have to fend off attempts to remove him from office.

White House officials believe the President has the backing of Republican allies in Congress and that impeachment is not in the cards, CNN reported. Even Democrats have tried to calm impeachment talk out of concern it is premature. But lawyers in the White House counsel's office have consulted experts in impeachment during the past week and have begun collecting information on how such proceedings would work, a person briefed on the matter told CNN.

Trump's glibness in private - and even public - statements has apparently caused his staff some consternation. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump’s aides have been pressing for more restraint by the president on Twitter, and some weeks ago they organized what one official called an “intervention.” Aides have been concerned about the president’s use of Twitter to push inflammatory claims, notably his unsubstantiated allegation from March that his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, had wiretapped his offices, the Journal reported.

In that meeting, aides warned Mr. Trump that certain kinds of comments made on Twitter would “paint him into a corner,” both in terms of political messaging and legally, an unnamed official told the Journal.

The top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, D-Md., called on Republican leaders to obtain the documents related to Trump's comments to Russian officials about Comey.

“This new report that President Trump openly admitted to the Russians that he ‘faced great pressure’ from the FBI’s criminal investigation that was ‘taken off’ when he fired Director Comey is astonishing — and extremely troubling,"" Cummings said in a statement.

""If these White House documents in fact exist memorializing the President’s statements to the Russians, the Oversight Committee needs to obtain copies immediately,"" he continued. ""Chairman (Jason) Chaffetz should request these White House documents today and have his subpoena pen ready— just as he did earlier this week with the memos written by Director Comey.”

The FBI applications to federal judges under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) are a central focus of the Justice Department ’ s special review of how the Obama administration started its probe into the Donald Trump campaign .
Obtaining four surveillance warrants on Carter Page from October 2016 to September 2017 was one of the FBI ’ s most aggressive steps to try to prove that Trump associates conspired with the Kremlin to interfere in the 2016 election . The FBI asserted that Mr . Page was a foreign agent for Russia and helped it interfere in the election .
In the end , special counsel Robert Mueller ’ s March report said that his 22-month investigation didn ’ t find any such conspiracy . He essentially cleared Mr . Page .
The FISA warrants first came to public light in July 2018 , when the FBI reluctantly declassified 412 pages of four highly redacted applications signed by senior FBI and Justice Department officials .
At the time they were released , Republicans leveled two main complaints : dubious corroboration of allegations against Mr . Page and the FBI ’ s use of Democratic Party opposition research , known as the dossier , to justify spying on the Trump campaign .
President Trump approved the release based on efforts by Rep. Devin Nunes , California Republican and then-chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence . Mr. Nunes ’ principal complaint was that agents relied on the 35-page dossier compiled by ex-British intelligence officer Christopher Steele , who was paid with funds from the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party .
What is known more fully today about the FISA applications ’ accuracy comes from three main sources : a formal investigation by congressional Republicans into FBI actions , the Mueller report and court filings by Mr. Steele in London . He is being sued by Russians named in his infamous dossier .
Here are six FISA application discrepancies , based on an analysis by The ███ . The applications state at the beginning that they are “ verified. ” The four documents were submitted to a FISA judge under penalty of perjury .
⦁ The FBI told judges the bureau had “ closed Mr. Steele out as an active source ” after agents discovered he violated its rules and leaked information to a news outlet right before the election .
This is misleading . The Republican investigation showed that the FBI continued to solicit and rely on Mr. Steele via two go-betweens — a special agent and Justice Department official Bruce Ohr — well into 2017 .
⦁ Fusion GPS , Mrs. Clinton ’ s opposition research firm that handled Mr. Steele , never told the British ex-spy the “ motivation ” behind the investigation into Mr. Trump ’ s ties to Russia , the FBI told judges .
But Mr. Steele appeared to have a firm understanding that his work was partisan , according to his August 2018 court filing . His research was to help Mrs. Clinton file a legal challenge if she lost the Nov. 8 election . The challenge would be based on Russia helping Mr. Trump .
Mr. Steele was paid by the law firm Perkins Coie , which represented the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party .
Mr. Steele declared in court : “ Fusion ’ s immediate client was law firm Perkins Coie . It engaged Fusion to obtain information necessary for Perkins Coie LLP to provide legal advice on the potential impact of Russian involvement on the legal validity of the outcome of the 2016 US Presidential election . Based on that advice , parties such as the Democratic National Committee and HFACC Inc. ( also known as Hillary for America ) could consider steps they would be legally entitled to take to challenge the validity of the outcome of that election . ”
In addition , Mr. Steele took his dossier material in October 2016 to a senior State Department official . According to a State Department memo , he said his research was “ at the behest of an institution he declined to identify that had been hacked . ”
This would suggest Mr. Steele knew he was working for Democrats whose computers were hacked by Russians .
⦁ As corroboration of Mr. Steele ’ s allegations , the FBI cited a Sept. 23 , 2016 , Yahoo News story that essentially said the same thing — that Mr . Page had met with two high-level associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow to discuss removing U.S.-imposed sanctions on Russian oligarchs and businesses . Mr. Steele said Mr . Page agreed in exchange for a brokerage fee — in other words , a bribe .
The FBI told the judges that Mr. Steele wasn ’ t a source for the story because Mr. Steele said he only provided his information to Fusion .
“ The FBI does not believe that [ Steele ] directly provided this information to the identified news organization that published the September 23rd news article , ” the FBI told the judge .
The FBI was wrong . Mr. Steele was the exclusive Yahoo source , so there was no corroboration .
By the time the FBI filed its fourth wiretap request in June 2017 , it had ample opportunity to find out that Mr. Steele had in fact contacted the press in Washington .
He filed a declaration in a London court in April that read : “ Save that it is admitted that the Second Defendant [ Mr. Steele ] gave off the record briefings to a small number of journalists about the pre-election memoranda in late summer/autumn 2016 . ”
One of the reporters he briefed , Michael Isikoff , wrote the Yahoo story .
That declaration became public in an April 25 story in The ███ , headlined “ Christopher Steele admits dossier charge unverified . ”
The story was widely circulated . The Times published the Steele document . The FBI had weeks to review the Steele case in London and amend its June application to reflect that Mr. Steele had spoken to reporters before the Yahoo story ran .
⦁ The FBI never told judges that Democrats funded Mr. Steele .
Instead , the FBI wrote in all four applications , including the June 2017 one : “ The FBI speculates that the identified U.S. person [ Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS ] was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate # l ’ s campaign . ”
Former FBI Director James B. Comey testified to Congress in December 2018 that he knew Democrats funded the dossier before the first FISA application was submitted in October 2016 .
⦁ The FBI told judges that Mr . Page coordinated with Russia to influence the election .
“ The FBI believes that Page has been collaborating and conspiring with the Russian government , ” the FBI said in the FISA application .
“ The FBI believes that the Russian Government ’ s efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. Presidential election were being coordinated with Page and perhaps other individuals associated with Candidate , ” the FBI told judges .
These may be a reference to Mr. Steele ’ s allegation that former campaign manager Paul Manafort and Mr . Page worked together with the Kremlin .
In fact , no evidence ever surfaced that the two men knew each other , much less worked tougher .
“ The investigation did not establish that Page coordinated with the Russian government in its efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election , ” Mr. Mueller said .
⦁ The FBI told FISA judges that Mr. Steele was “ credible ” based on previous research as a paid human source .
The applications ’ uncensored sections don ’ t disclose that the FBI did a report card on Mr. Steele . It said it had only “ minimally corroborated ” the dossier and had only “ medium confidence ” in his work .
The grade was contained in a “ Human Source Validation Report , ” a copy of which was obtained by The ███ under an open-records request .
The assessment was written after the FBI fired Mr. Steele in November 2016 .
In closing his case , Mr. Mueller came to this conclusion regarding Mr. Steele ’ s dozen or so felony accusations against Mr. Trump and associates that had circulated in the Obama administration : “ The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities . ”
Today , the dossier and Mr. Steele have gone from FBI source to an investigative focus .
Attorney General William Barr , alarmed that the Obama administration put the Trump campaign under investigation , has tapped John Durham , the U.S. attorney for Connecticut , to review how the FBI conducted the probe .
“ These counterintelligence activities that were directed at the Trump campaign were not done in the normal course and not through the normal procedures , as far as I can tell , ” Mr. Barr told CBS News on Friday .
There are conflicting media reports that Mr. Steele has agreed or refused to meet with Mr. Durham in London .
The first dossier verdict will likely come from Michael Horowitz , the Justice Department ’ s inspector general . He has been investigating what Republicans call “ FISA abuse ” since last year .
At one time , Mr. Trump was set to declassified larger FISA application portions . But he backed off in September 2018 partly because allies objected .
That would indicate that the FBI tapped Western intelligence sources to fill out the wiretap applications .","Four FBI wiretap applications targeting a Trump campaign volunteer were more inaccurate than previously known based on subsequent investigative information, an analysis shows.

⦁ As corroboration of Mr. Steele’s allegations, the FBI cited a Sept. 23, 2016, Yahoo News story that essentially said the same thing — that Mr. Page had met with two high-level associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow to discuss removing U.S.-imposed sanctions on Russian oligarchs and businesses. Mr. Steele said Mr. Page agreed in exchange for a brokerage fee — in other words, a bribe.

The FBI told the judges that Mr. Steele wasn’t a source for the story because Mr. Steele said he only provided his information to Fusion.

“The FBI does not believe that [Steele] directly provided this information to the identified news organization that published the September 23rd news article,” the FBI told the judge.

The FBI was wrong. Mr. Steele was the exclusive Yahoo source, so there was no corroboration.

By the time the FBI filed its fourth wiretap request in June 2017, it had ample opportunity to find out that Mr. Steele had in fact contacted the press in Washington.

He filed a declaration in a London court in April that read: “Save that it is admitted that the Second Defendant [Mr. Steele] gave off the record briefings to a small number of journalists about the pre-election memoranda in late summer/autumn 2016.”

One of the reporters he briefed, Michael Isikoff, wrote the Yahoo story.

That declaration became public in an April 25 story in The Washington Times, headlined “Christopher Steele admits dossier charge unverified.”

The story was widely circulated. The Times published the Steele document. The FBI had weeks to review the Steele case in London and amend its June application to reflect that Mr. Steele had spoken to reporters before the Yahoo story ran.

⦁ The FBI never told judges that Democrats funded Mr. Steele.

Instead, the FBI wrote in all four applications, including the June 2017 one: “The FBI speculates that the identified U.S. person [Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS] was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate #l’s campaign.”

Former FBI Director James B. Comey testified to Congress in December 2018 that he knew Democrats funded the dossier before the first FISA application was submitted in October 2016.

⦁ The FBI told judges that Mr. Page coordinated with Russia to influence the election.

“The FBI believes that Page has been collaborating and conspiring with the Russian government,” the FBI said in the FISA application.

“The FBI believes that the Russian Government’s efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. Presidential election were being coordinated with Page and perhaps other individuals associated with Candidate,” the FBI told judges.

These may be a reference to Mr. Steele’s allegation that former campaign manager Paul Manafort and Mr. Page worked together with the Kremlin.

In fact, no evidence ever surfaced that the two men knew each other, much less worked tougher.

Months later, the Mueller report found no such conspiracy.

“The investigation did not establish that Page coordinated with the Russian government in its efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election,” Mr. Mueller said.

⦁ The FBI told FISA judges that Mr. Steele was “credible” based on previous research as a paid human source.

The applications’ uncensored sections don’t disclose that the FBI did a report card on Mr. Steele. It said it had only “minimally corroborated” the dossier and had only “medium confidence” in his work.

The grade was contained in a “Human Source Validation Report,” a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Times under an open-records request.

The assessment was written after the FBI fired Mr. Steele in November 2016.

In closing his case, Mr. Mueller came to this conclusion regarding Mr. Steele’s dozen or so felony accusations against Mr. Trump and associates that had circulated in the Obama administration: “The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.”

Today, the dossier and Mr. Steele have gone from FBI source to an investigative focus.

Attorney General William Barr, alarmed that the Obama administration put the Trump campaign under investigation, has tapped John Durham, the U.S. attorney for Connecticut, to review how the FBI conducted the probe.

“These counterintelligence activities that were directed at the Trump campaign were not done in the normal course and not through the normal procedures, as far as I can tell,” Mr. Barr told CBS News on Friday.

There are conflicting media reports that Mr. Steele has agreed or refused to meet with Mr. Durham in London.

The first dossier verdict will likely come from Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department’s inspector general. He has been investigating what Republicans call “FISA abuse” since last year.

At one time, Mr. Trump was set to declassified larger FISA application portions. But he backed off in September 2018 partly because allies objected.

That would indicate that the FBI tapped Western intelligence sources to fill out the wiretap applications.

Previous media reports said the FBI probe would be limited in how many accusers the agency would interview regarding Kavanaugh ’ s past – but the president wrote Saturday that he had placed no such barriers on investigators .
Trump ’ s message , tweeted after his “ Make America Great Again ” rally in Wheeling , W. Va. , targeted a report by NBC News , though the Wall Street Journal had reported a similar story .
“ NBC News incorrectly reported ( as usual ) that I was limiting the FBI investigation of Judge Kavanaugh , and witnesses , only to certain people , ” the president wrote . “ Actually , I want them to interview whoever they deem appropriate , at their discretion . Please correct your reporting ! ”
The president ’ s message , however , did not address the timeframe of about a week that the FBI had been given to complete its “ supplemental investigation , ” ordered in the wake of Thursday ’ s Senate Judiciary Committee testimony by accuser Christine Blasey Ford and Judge Kavanaugh .
NBC and the Journal had reported Saturday that a White House official had stated that the FBI would investigate the claims against Kavanaugh made by accusers Ford and Deborah Ramirez , but would not examine the claims made by Julie Swetnick , who like the others had asserted that Kavanaugh engaged in sexual misconduct during his high school years .
Neither Ramirez nor Swetnick participated in Thursday ’ s hearing on Capitol Hill .
But Trump ’ s statement late Saturday suggested that FBI personnel face no restrictions against interviewing Swetnick – or any other person they deemed relevant to the accusations against Kavanaugh .
Earlier , White House spokesman Raj Shah also contradicted the claims of limits on the FBI that were attributed to an unnamed White House official .

The previous reports on the possible exclusion of Swetnick had angered her attorney , Michael Avenatti , the same lawyer who represents porn star Stormy Daniels in her claims against President Trump .
“ If true , this is outrageous , '' Avenatti tweeted Saturday afternoon . `` Why are Trump and his cronies in the Senate trying to prevent the American people from learning the truth ? Why do they insist on muzzling women with information submitted under penalty of perjury ? Why Ramirez but not my client ? ”
Later , Avenatti tweeted : “ Trump has now determined that he and he alone will be the sole arbiter of whether a woman ’ s claims of sexual assault and misogyny are credible .

McCabe , a former acting FBI director , was fired Friday night after multiple federal probes and reports showed that he lied to investigators reviewing the bureau ’ s probe into whether Hillary Clinton sent and received classified information on private email servers while secretary of state .
He was fired days before he would have been eligible for a lifetime pension .
Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he officially fired McCabe after receiving a report from the Inspector General , the findings from the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and the recommendation of the Justice Department ’ s senior career official . He said the firing was based on Justice Department procedure .
The attorney general said the reports concluded that McCabe made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor -- including under oath -- on multiple occasions . Sessions also said McCabe was fired after a “ fair and extensive ” investigation .
“ Andrew McCabe FIRED , a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy , ” Trump tweeted Friday night . “ Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy . He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI ! ”
On Saturday afternoon he tweeted : `` As the House Intelligence Committee has concluded , there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign . As many are now finding out , however , there was tremendous leaking , lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI , Justice & State . # DrainTheSwamp ''
Republicans on the GOP-controlled committee ealier this month reached that conclusion , though Democrats on the panel disagree .
Trump has been feuding with FBI leadership since taking office , suggesting top bureau officials are undermining him and his administration – particularly with its investigation into whether his 2016 presidential campaign colluded with Russia .
“ When the full extent of your venality , moral turpitude , and political corruption becomes known , you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history , ” Brennan , an Obama administration CIA director , tweeted in response to Trump ’ s tweet . “ You may scapegoat Andy McCabe , but you will not destroy America ... America will triumph over you . ”
McCabe , who served as the FBI ’ s acting director after Trump fired James Comey in May 2017 , said his dismissal is “ part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally , but to taint the FBI , law enforcement and intelligence professionals more generally . ”
`` It is part of this Administration ’ s ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the Special Counsel ( Russia collusion ) investigation , ” he said in a statement . “ For the last year and a half , my family and I have been the targets of an unrelenting assault on our reputation and my service to this country .
He continued : “ The President ’ s tweets have amplified and exacerbated it all . He called for my firing . He called for me to be stripped of my pension after more than 20 years of service . ''
McCabe led the bureau , independently , until Aug. 2 , 2017 -- during the early months of the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates .
Republicans have long criticized McCabe for his ties to the Democratic Party — his wife received donations during a failed 2015 Virginia Senate run from a group tied to a Clinton ally , former Virginia Gov . Terry McAuliffe — all while the Clinton email probe was underway .
McCabe returned to the spotlight when Republicans on the House Intelligence committee released its memo on Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuses in connection with the Russia probe , saying that McCabe signed a FISA warrant targeting former Trump campaign volunteer adviser Carter Page .","Former CIA Director John Brennan slammed President Trump on Saturday for firing Andrew McCabe days before being eligible for a lifetime pension, suggesting the president is a “demagogue” headed for the “dustbin of history.”

Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he officially fired McCabe after receiving a report from the Inspector General, the findings from the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and the recommendation of the Justice Department’s senior career official. He said the firing was based on Justice Department procedure.

The attorney general said the reports concluded that McCabe made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor -- including under oath -- on multiple occasions. Sessions also said McCabe was fired after a “fair and extensive” investigation.

“Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy,” Trump tweeted Friday night. “Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!”

On Saturday afternoon he tweeted: ""As the House Intelligence Committee has concluded, there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign. As many are now finding out, however, there was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI, Justice & State. #DrainTheSwamp""

Republicans on the GOP-controlled committee ealier this month reached that conclusion, though Democrats on the panel disagree.



Trump has been feuding with FBI leadership since taking office, suggesting top bureau officials are undermining him and his administration – particularly with its investigation into whether his 2016 presidential campaign colluded with Russia.

“When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history,” Brennan, an Obama administration CIA director, tweeted in response to Trump’s tweet. “You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will not destroy America...America will triumph over you.”

McCabe, who served as the FBI’s acting director after Trump fired James Comey in May 2017, said his dismissal is “part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally, but to taint the FBI, law enforcement and intelligence professionals more generally.”

""It is part of this Administration’s ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the Special Counsel (Russia collusion) investigation,” he said in a statement. “For the last year and a half, my family and I have been the targets of an unrelenting assault on our reputation and my service to this country.

He continued: “The President’s tweets have amplified and exacerbated it all. He called for my firing. He called for me to be stripped of my pension after more than 20 years of service.""

McCabe led the bureau, independently, until Aug. 2, 2017 -- during the early months of the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates.

Republicans have long criticized McCabe for his ties to the Democratic Party — his wife received donations during a failed 2015 Virginia Senate run from a group tied to a Clinton ally, former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe — all while the Clinton email probe was underway.

McCabe returned to the spotlight when Republicans on the House Intelligence committee released its memo on Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuses in connection with the Russia probe, saying that McCabe signed a FISA warrant targeting former Trump campaign volunteer adviser Carter Page.

The president’s announcement came a day before Mr. Comey’s highly anticipated testimony before a Senate committee. Mr. Comey is scheduled Thursday to describe publicly for the first time his private interactions with the president.

Mr. Trump’s decision to fire Mr. Comey last month—as the Federal Bureau of Investigation probed whether the president’s associates colluded with Moscow—roiled Washington and the FBI. Mr. Trump has denied any collusion, and Russian officials have denied interfering in the U.S. election.

The Justice Department’s recent decision to name Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation in a sense removed pressure from Mr. Trump’s search for a new FBI director because the agency’s new leader won’t oversee the Russia inquiry as Mr. Comey had.

Trump announced the move five days after he surprised many in Washington by making the conservative Republican lawmaker from Texas his selection to replace Daniel Coats as director of national intelligence , a post that oversees the 17 U.S. civilian and military intelligence agencies including the CIA .
According to a source familiar with the situation , Trump is considering Republican Representatives Michael McCaul and Devin Nunes for the job . McCaul is a former chairman of the House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee and Nunes is a former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee .
Trump told reporters at the White House he has “ a list of three people ” he will consider for the job this weekend . The Republican president blamed unflattering news coverage for Ratcliffe ’ s decision to bow out and instead remain in the House . Ratcliffe , 53 , faced a potentially difficult Senate confirmation process .
The vacancy comes as the U.S. intelligence community grapples with an array of challenges , including the threat of foreign interference in next year ’ s U.S. elections , the impact of a rising China , escalating tensions with Iran , North Korea ’ s nuclear program and the desire to end years of conflict in Afghanistan , Iraq and Syria .
Trump announced last Sunday that Coats , who had clashed with him over assessments involving Russia , Iran and North Korea , will step down on Aug. 15 .
Ratcliffe , a Trump loyalist and the most junior member of the House Intelligence Committee , had been tapped , but not formally nominated , to replace Coats .
“ Rather than going through months of slander and libel , I explained to John how miserable it would be for him and his family to deal with these people , ” Trump said on Twitter .
The change in leadership at the top of the U.S. intelligence community comes after a half-year of turmoil atop the Pentagon . The Senate on July 23 confirmed Army Secretary Mark Esper as defense secretary , ending the longest period that the Pentagon had been without a permanent top official , a stint that began after James Mattis resigned in December over policy differences with Trump .
Trump ’ s previous pick for defense secretary , Patrick Shanahan , withdrew in June after reports of domestic violence in his family .
The post of director of national intelligence was created after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks on the United States .
Ratcliffe , confirming he had withdrawn from consideration , said he thought the confirmation process would become a partisan battle between Republicans and Democrats .
“ I do not wish for a national security and intelligence debate surrounding my confirmation , however untrue , to become a purely political and partisan issue , ” Ratcliffe said .
Ratcliffe gained attention by defending Trump and criticizing former Special Counsel Robert Mueller during a July hearing on Mueller ’ s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election .
Although Ratcliffe had touted his counter-terrorism experience as a federal prosecutor in Texas , media outlets including ███ reported on concerns that he may have exaggerated his achievements in the post .
Democratic lawmakers and some former senior U.S. intelligence officers had said Ratcliffe lacked the expertise and experience to replace Coats . Some voiced concern that he would warp U.S. intelligence to support Trump ’ s views . Ratcliffe served for six months on the intelligence panel .
Trump said he might name the No . 2 intelligence official , Sue Gordon , as acting director of national intelligence . That is required when there is a vacancy in the top job . Such a move would likely be reassuring to many U.S. intelligence experts because of her deep experience .
However , some Trump allies , according to the source familiar with the matter , were floating the possibility of instead naming CIA Director Gina Haspel as acting director until a permanent director is confirmed by the Senate .
Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr said while he was “ heartened ” that the office of the director of national intelligence has an experienced team in place during the transition , “ there is no substitute for having a Senate-confirmed director in place ” leading it .
Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer , a critic of Ratcliffe for the job , said in a statement , “ The next Director of National Intelligence must be someone who is nonpartisan , sees the world objectively and speaks truth to power . ”

While Trump regularly attacks the media , he told reporters , “ You ’ re part of the vetting process . ... We save a lot of money that way . ”","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Friday dropped his choice of John Ratcliffe to be U.S. spy chief after questions arose about the congressman’s lack of experience and possible exaggerations in his resume, marking the latest upheaval over a top national security post.

Trump announced the move five days after he surprised many in Washington by making the conservative Republican lawmaker from Texas his selection to replace Daniel Coats as director of national intelligence, a post that oversees the 17 U.S. civilian and military intelligence agencies including the CIA.

According to a source familiar with the situation, Trump is considering Republican Representatives Michael McCaul and Devin Nunes for the job. McCaul is a former chairman of the House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee and Nunes is a former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.

Trump told reporters at the White House he has “a list of three people” he will consider for the job this weekend. The Republican president blamed unflattering news coverage for Ratcliffe’s decision to bow out and instead remain in the House. Ratcliffe, 53, faced a potentially difficult Senate confirmation process.

The vacancy comes as the U.S. intelligence community grapples with an array of challenges, including the threat of foreign interference in next year’s U.S. elections, the impact of a rising China, escalating tensions with Iran, North Korea’s nuclear program and the desire to end years of conflict in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria.

Trump announced last Sunday that Coats, who had clashed with him over assessments involving Russia, Iran and North Korea, will step down on Aug. 15.

Ratcliffe, a Trump loyalist and the most junior member of the House Intelligence Committee, had been tapped, but not formally nominated, to replace Coats.

“Rather than going through months of slander and libel, I explained to John how miserable it would be for him and his family to deal with these people,” Trump said on Twitter.

“John has therefore decided to stay in Congress.”

PENTAGON TURMOIL

The change in leadership at the top of the U.S. intelligence community comes after a half-year of turmoil atop the Pentagon. The Senate on July 23 confirmed Army Secretary Mark Esper as defense secretary, ending the longest period that the Pentagon had been without a permanent top official, a stint that began after James Mattis resigned in December over policy differences with Trump.

Trump’s previous pick for defense secretary, Patrick Shanahan, withdrew in June after reports of domestic violence in his family.

The post of director of national intelligence was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.

Ratcliffe, confirming he had withdrawn from consideration, said he thought the confirmation process would become a partisan battle between Republicans and Democrats.

“I do not wish for a national security and intelligence debate surrounding my confirmation, however untrue, to become a purely political and partisan issue,” Ratcliffe said.

Ratcliffe gained attention by defending Trump and criticizing former Special Counsel Robert Mueller during a July hearing on Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.

Although Ratcliffe had touted his counter-terrorism experience as a federal prosecutor in Texas, media outlets including Reuters reported on concerns that he may have exaggerated his achievements in the post.

Democratic lawmakers and some former senior U.S. intelligence officers had said Ratcliffe lacked the expertise and experience to replace Coats. Some voiced concern that he would warp U.S. intelligence to support Trump’s views. Ratcliffe served for six months on the intelligence panel.

Trump said he might name the No. 2 intelligence official, Sue Gordon, as acting director of national intelligence. That is required when there is a vacancy in the top job. Such a move would likely be reassuring to many U.S. intelligence experts because of her deep experience.

However, some Trump allies, according to the source familiar with the matter, were floating the possibility of instead naming CIA Director Gina Haspel as acting director until a permanent director is confirmed by the Senate.

Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr said while he was “heartened” that the office of the director of national intelligence has an experienced team in place during the transition, “there is no substitute for having a Senate-confirmed director in place” leading it.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, a critic of Ratcliffe for the job, said in a statement, “The next Director of National Intelligence must be someone who is nonpartisan, sees the world objectively and speaks truth to power.”

What will the FBI investigation do?

Announcing the move, President Trump said: ""I've ordered the FBI to conduct a supplemental investigation to update Judge Kavanaugh's file.

""As the Senate has requested, this update must be limited in scope and completed in less than one week.""

The inquiry involves the FBI reopening its previously completed background check on Judge Kavanaugh. This may mean going back to old witnesses - or speaking to new ones.

Dr Ford's lawyer said her client welcomed the step but questioned the time limit of a week to hold the investigation.",www.bbc.com,center,LFMVHFfUBcynfHrC

Texts that have been made public , which show the two employees and reported lovers talking about their antipathy toward the president and efforts to impeach him , have become a major embarrassment for an FBI already reeling from accusations of bias and bungling .
But the Justice Department said it lost five months of texts from FBI agent Peter Strzok during a key period when he and FBI lawyer Lisa Page were venting about Mr. Trump and investigations surrounding the 2016 presidential election .
Mr. Trump on Tuesday called the missing messages “ one of the biggest stories in a long time , ” and the White House said reporters should treat the lost texts with the “ same obsession ” they have approached suspicions of collusion between Russia and the presidential campaign .
The FBI couple exchanged more than 50,000 texts from July 1 , 2015 , to July 28 , 2017 .
The FBI was expected to provide Congress with a new batch of texts that the couple exchanged from Dec. 14 , 2016 , to May 17 , 2017 . But the agency told lawmakers over the weekend that “ misconfiguration issues ” caused a loss of the texts .

Mr. Horowitz has until Jan. 29 to respond to the letter , the senators said in an announcement .
While politicians debate whether to release the content of the text messages , technology analysts question how five months of texts could have disappeared .

FBI Director James Comey on Wednesday defended his decision to tell Congress in October that he was revisiting the bureau's investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails.

Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Comey said he believed revisiting the investigation just before the election — knowing it could affect the outcome — would be really bad, but that not to do so would be catastrophic for the agency's independence. In retrospect, he said, he still believes he made the right choice.

""Look, this was terrible. It makes me mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election. But honestly, it wouldn't change the decision,"" he said.

Comey's remarks were his first public comment on his decision to reopen the Clinton email investigation, which came after FBI agents discovered new communications connected to the former secretary of state's private server. Comey's letter to congressional leaders informing them of the action was immediately leaked, and Clinton says it contributed to her loss on Election Day.

Wednesday's testimony by Comey came during what was intended to be a routine oversight hearing of the FBI, but was instead dominated by questions relating to investigations surrounding the 2016 campaign.

Senators also asked Comey about Russia. He said Russia represents ""the greatest threat of any nation on Earth, given their intention and capability.""

He insisted that the FBI's investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election and the possible links between Trump campaign and Russian officials are being treated ""consistently under the same principles"" as the Clinton email probe. He said the bureau ""didn't say a word"" about the Russia-Trump probe ""until months into it,"" and that he expects ""we're not gonna say another peep about it until we're done."" He insisted that was the way the bureau handled the Clinton investigation as well.

The repercussions from Comey's action continue to reverberate across the political spectrum. At a forum in New York on Tuesday, Clinton said Comey's letter to Congress on Oct. 28 was a factor in her loss to President Trump. ""If the election had been on Oct. 27, I would be your president,"" she said, while also putting responsibility for her loss on her own actions.

Trump tweeted later Tuesday night that Comey ""was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds.""

Comey said being in the middle of — if not creating — a political firestorm has taken a toll. ""Lordy, has this been painful,"" he told committee members. ""I've gotten all kinds of rocks thrown at me, and this has been really hard, but I think I've done the right thing at each turn.""

Comey also disclosed that he has been interviewed by the Justice Department's Inspector General Office, which is conducing its own investigation into how the FBI handled the Clinton email probe. Comey said he welcomed the review.

Comey was asked if he was looking into whether FBI agents may have leaked information about the Clinton investigation. Trump adviser and former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said former agents had told him in advance of the reopening of the Clinton email investigation. Comey said if he finds out people leaked information about FBI investigations, ""there will be severe consequences.""

FBI Director James B. Comey , in a brief letter to Congress , said his agents have gone through all of the messages sent or received by Mrs. Clinton during her four-year tenure in the State Department that were on Ms. Abedin ’ s laptop .
“ Based on our review , we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton , ” Mr. Comey said .

This fall , FBI agents looking into sexting accusations against Ms. Abedin ’ s estranged husband , former Rep. Anthony D. Weiner , came across emails on a computer that the spouses shared . There was enough concern about the messages to prompt Mr. Comey to renew his probe .

Mr. Comey did say agents checked through all of the messages that could have involved Mrs. Clinton during her time in the State Department and that none of those messages changed the assessment announced in July after a yearlong investigation .

Sunday ’ s correction was seen by Democrats as a belated , though important , move .
“ While the original letter should never have been sent so close to an election , the expeditious review of these emails should put to rest — once and for all — the irresponsible speculation indulged in by the Trump campaign and others , ” said Rep.

But House Speaker Paul D. Ryan , Wisconsin Republican , said nothing changes the FBI ’ s original finding that Mrs. Clinton risked national security with her unique email practices .

Updated at 4:20 p.m. ET

The Justice Department's inspector general, Michael Horowitz, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday about his report on the origins of the FBI's probe into the 2016 Trump campaign's possible ties with Russia.

The 400-plus page report, released Monday, found that the FBI had ample evidence to open its investigation — despite allegations of political bias.

But, Horowitz told the panel, ""Our review identified significant concerns with how certain aspects of the investigation were conducted and supervised.""

He said the FBI failed to adhere ""to its own standards of accuracy and completeness"" when it filed applications under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act regarding former Trump campaign aide Carter Page.

""The activities we found here don't vindicate anybody,"" he said in response to a question about whether former FBI Director James Comey should feel vindicated about how the bureau handled the investigation, dubbed ""Crossfire Hurricane.""

The report found that the bureau's decision to open an investigation ""was in compliance with Department and FBI policies, and we did not find documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias or improper motivation influenced"" the decision.

Counterclaims about the findings

In lengthy opening remarks at the hearing, Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., blasted the FBI's conduct in its handling of the Russia investigation. ""What happened here is not a few irregularities,"" he said. ""What happened here is the system failed. People at the highest level of our government took the law in their own hands.""

""It's as if [former FBI Director] J. Edgar Hoover came back to life,"" Graham said, alluding to ""the old FBI ... that had a chip on its shoulder and wanted to intimidate people.""

Graham also asserted, counter to claims by the president and other Republicans, that Russia — not Ukraine — was responsible for meddling in the 2016 election. ""We know the Russians are messing in our elections. It was the Russians, ladies and gentlemen, who stole the Democratic National Committee emails, [former Clinton campaign chairman John] Podesta's emails and screwed around with Hillary Clinton. It wasn't the Ukrainians,"" Graham said. ""It was the Russians, and they're coming after us again.""

The top Democrat on the panel, Sen. Dianne Feinstein D-Calif., said in her opening statement that the IG's report rebutted President Trump's claims that the investigation into his campaign was politically motivated.

""There is no deep state,"" she said. ""Simply put, the FBI investigation was motivated by fact, not bias.""

In response to Democrats on the panel, Horowitz said his office ""certainly didn't see any evidence"" in FBI or Justice Department files that former President Barack Obama asked the U.S. government to investigate Donald Trump's campaign, as Trump has charged.

Nor, Horowitz said, was there any evidence that the Obama administration tapped Trump's phones at Trump Tower.

Horowitz also reaffirmed that the so-called Steele dossier, a collection of partly unverified reports about then-candidate Trump, ""had no impact"" on the bureau's decision to open the investigation.

The FISA warrant

A British former intelligence officer, Christopher Steele, was paid for his research by Democrats. Trump and Republicans have slammed the material as outrageous and say it's further egregious that it was used to justify surveillance on Page.

Referring to the Page surveillance application, Horowitz stated Wednesday, ""We are deeply concerned that so many basic and fundamental errors were made by three separate, hand-picked investigative teams, on one of the most sensitive FBI investigations, after the matter had been briefed to the highest levels within the FBI.""

According to the IG report, ""The Crossfire Hurricane team failed to inform Department officials of significant information that was available to the team at the time that the FISA applications were drafted and filed. Much of that information was inconsistent with, or undercut, the assertions contained in the FISA applications that were used to support probable cause and, in some instances, resulted in inaccurate information being included in the applications.""

Page was not charged with a crime.

An ongoing investigation

In addition to talking about Monday's report, Horowitz took questions from lawmakers about FBI conduct beyond the Trump campaign investigation, including how agents allegedly leaked details of the Clinton email probe.

The IG, in a previous report on the FBI's investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server, found that leaks from FBI agents to journalists and others were pervasive.

Horowitz said Wednesday that ""we are looking at, still,"" the issue of leaks from the FBI's New York field office. But he said that the challenge ""is proving who spoke to whom and when, based on records of the FBI.""

Democrats believe agents in New York leaked details of the investigation to Trump surrogate Rudy Giuliani, who said in October 2016 that ""big surprises"" were coming, shortly before then-FBI Director James Comey announced that new emails had been discovered relating to Clinton.

Reaction to the IG report

Horowitz announced his investigation into the FBI's investigation of the Trump campaign in March 2018 after requests from the attorney general and lawmakers.

Trump and allied Republicans have long argued that the Russia probe was a political ""witch hunt"" without legal merit. For Democrats, the findings of the Russia inquiry have helped fuel the move toward impeachment.

The release of the inspector general's report only hardened that divide, as further demonstrated in Wednesday's hearing.

In an interview Tuesday, Attorney General William Barr blasted Horowitz's report, telling NBC News that ""I think our nation was turned on its head for three years based on a completely bogus narrative that was largely fanned and hyped by a completely irresponsible press.""

Barr has commissioned a separate report on the origins of the Russia investigation, led by veteran prosecutor John Durham. Durham said Monday that his findings, while still in progress, differ from the inspector general's.

FBI Director Christopher Wray, meanwhile, promised to make reforms in light of the report. But Trump cast doubt on Wray's ability to ""fix"" the FBI, which Trump contended in a tweet Tuesday ""is badly broken.""",www.npr.org,center,k86Vx9aR3NuDtDsP

The Washington Post writes:

The referral to the D.C. U.S. Attorney’s Office occurred some time ago, after the inspector general concluded McCabe had lied to investigators or his own boss, then-FBI Director James B. Comey, on four occasions, three of them under oath. [...] The referral raises at least the possibility that McCabe could be charged and jailed for his alleged misconduct — perhaps with Comey testifying as a witness against him. A referral to federal prosecutors, though, does not necessarily mean McCabe will be charged with a crime. Michael R. Bromwich, McCabe’s lawyer, said in a statement: “We were advised of the referral within the past few weeks.

FBI counterintelligence investigators have tremendous capabilities at their disposal , and are in a very good position to find proof of coordination between the Trump campaign and Moscow if it exists .
President Trump , for his part , spent Monday morning denying there was any real story here :
The Democrats made up and pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running a terrible campaign . Big advantage in Electoral College & lost ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) March 20 , 2017
This , at least for the time being , is clearly false . The FBI investigation means the Russia story isn ’ t made up , and won ’ t go away .
What we know about the Trump campaign ’ s ties to Russia
Rumors of Trump-Russia coordination really began after we found out about the hack of the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) in June 2016 . Suspicion fell on Russia almost immediately , given Trump ’ s pro-Russian approach to foreign policy and Russia ’ s long history of interfering in Western elections . As emails hacked from Clinton allies continued to leak to the press in a way that seemed designed to damage her campaign , these suspicions grew stronger .
At this point , the evidence that Russia is responsible is pretty conclusive . Private cybersecurity firms and researchers have linked some of the code in the hack to known Russian operations ; there ’ s consensus in the US intelligence community that Russia ’ s operation was designed in part to help Trump .
All of this raised the million-dollar question : Did Trump , or anyone on his team , know about the hack targeting Clinton while it was going on ? And did they plan their campaign strategy , which centered on “ Crooked Hillary ” and her emails , around Russian interference ?
There is certainly circumstantial evidence . Paul Manafort , who was Trump ’ s campaign manager at the time the first emails went public , has longstanding ties to the Russian state . He resigned in late August — right in the middle of the campaign — after a secret ledger was discovered with his name in it , suggesting he had quietly received $ 12.7 million between 2007 and 2012 from Ukraine ’ s pro-Russian former president , Viktor Yanukovych .
In August , longtime conservative political operative and close Trump confidant Roger Stone said that he was in touch with WikiLeaks , the source through which Russia released the hacked emails to the public . On October 2 , Stone sent a tweet hinting he had inside knowledge that WikiLeaks was about to torpedo Clinton ’ s campaign :
Five days later , on October 7 , WikiLeaks released the first tranche of emails hacked from Clinton campaign manager John Podesta .
Trump himself seemed to encourage Russian involvement in the election . In a July 2016 press conference , his final presser of the campaign , Trump publicly called on Russia to hack Clinton and publish emails from her private server .
`` Russia , if you ’ re listening , I hope you ’ re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing , '' Trump said . `` I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press . ''
After the campaign was over , Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov publicly admitted that members of Trump ’ s “ entourage ” were in touch with Russia . “ I can not say that all of them , but quite a few have been staying in touch with Russian representatives , ” he told the Russian news service Interfax .
Subsequent news reports , sourced to members of the US government and intelligence services , confirmed Ryabkov ’ s comments . The New York Times reported in February that members of Trump ’ s campaign team and other “ Trump associates ” had “ repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials ” prior to the November vote . The calls were intercepted by US officials monitoring Russian intelligence , who then leaked their existence to the Times .
Manafort was the only Trump official identified by name in the Times report , though he denied the allegations .
“ I have never knowingly spoken to Russian intelligence officers , ” Manafort told the Times reporters . “ It ’ s not like these people wear badges that say , ‘ I ’ m a Russian intelligence officer . ’ ”
Then in early March , the Washington Post reported that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak twice during the 2016 campaign , when he was serving as a Trump adviser . This is despite the fact that Sessions said in his confirmation hearing that “ I did not have communications with the Russians ” — while under oath . The disclosure forced Sessions to recuse himself from any involvement in the FBI ’ s Russia investigation .
Put this all together and two things become clear . First , an unknown number of Trump campaign operatives and Trump-adjacent people were in touch with agents of the Russian government . Second , the Trump camp had no problem with Russian interference in the election , and at times seemed to welcome it .
What we don ’ t know is whether there ’ s a connection between those two things — that is , whether the Trump camp knew about the Russian hack while it was ongoing or worked with the Kremlin to weaponize it . There ’ s no confirmation , in the Times or Post reports , to support this .
“ The officials interviewed in recent weeks said that , so far , they had seen no evidence of such cooperation , ” the Times reports .
There is a smidgen of evidence outside of the calls to support cooperation allegations . An uncorroborated dossier put together by a former British intelligence operative , Christopher Steele , claims there was an “ extensive conspiracy ” between Trump and the Russians to weaken the Clinton campaign . The evidence comes entirely from testimony from anonymous sources , with little identifiable corroboration , and thus is very far from conclusive ( though parts of it have apparently been deemed credible ) .
“ Source E , an ethnic Russian close associate of Republican US presidential candidate Donald TRUMP , admitted that there was a well-developed conspiracy between them and the Russian leadership , ” Steele writes in the dossier . “ This was managed of the TRUMP side by the Republican candidate ’ s campaign manager , Paul MANAFORT . ”
So the question of whether the American president assisted in a Russian effort to interfere with the democratic process is still very much open . And the FBI , we now know , is investigating it thoroughly .","FBI Director James Comey has just dropped a bombshell — confirming for the first time that the FBI is investigating links between Trump allies and Russia.

MARK PENN : FBI TRUMP-RUSSIA INVESTIGATION SHOWS DEEP STATE WAS WORSE THAN WE THOUGHT
To readers of my book , `` The Russia Hoax : The Illicit Scheme To Clear Hillary Clinton And Frame Donald Trump , ” this comes as no surprise . As detailed therein , Comey and his faithful confederates at the Bureau twisted facts and contorted the law to absolve Clinton of all criminal acts she most certainly committed in the mishandling of her classified emails while Secretary of State .
On the same day Comey exonerated Clinton , his FBI was furtively meeting with the author of the fictitious anti-Trump `` dossier '' funded by Clinton and the Democrats . Although nothing in the phony document was true or ever verified , the FBI used it as a pretext to commence and advance a malicious investigation into whether Trump `` colluded '' with Russia to steal the 2016 presidential election . They also exploited the `` dossier '' as the basis to gain a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign , concealing the truth from the intelligence court and deceiving the judges .
Over the next ten months , the FBI failed to corroborate anything in the `` dossier . '' Bureau agents uncovered no evidence that Trump had somehow conspired or coordinated with Russia to influence the election . Then came the firing of Comey for just cause . Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , Comey 's direct boss , volunteered to author a memorandum recommending his termination for multiple acts of misconduct and serious violations of Justice Department and FBI rules in the Clinton case . Six former Attorneys General and Deputy Attorneys General from different eras and both political parties endorsed his termination . Comey was canned for reasons that were entirely merited and had nothing whatsoever to do with the Russia probe . The president was constitutionally authorized to take such action , which Comey confirmed in a letter to his colleagues at the FBI .
As I noted in my book , `` Almost immediately , demands for impeachment of President Trump were heard in the corridors of Congress . The liberal media were crazed with excitement over the prospect that the president had obstructed justice in trying to block the Russian investigation . In truth and in law , neither scenarios were remotely rational . ''
When the people we entrust to enforce the law become the lawbreakers , they must be held accountable .
Among those who were aggrieved over Comey 's firing was his loyal lieutenant , Andrew McCabe , who became Acting FBI Director , as well as bureau lawyer Lisa Page and her paramour , Peter Strzok , a top counterintelligence agent . Page and Strzok were intimately involved in the `` collusion '' investigation and were virulently opposed to the president both politically and personally , as evidence by their numerous anti-Trump text messages .
In the eight-day period after Comey 's termination , top officials at the FBI decided to take action . They would originate a counterintelligence investigation of Trump for being a foreign agent of Russia . Critically , they had no evidence or even reasonable suspicion to support their operation . They simply despised Trump and chose to misuse their positions of power in an illegal act of reprisal .
Once again , the FBI needed a pretext.They coalesced around the idea that Comey 's firing might constitute obstruction of justice if it was intended to stop or impede the original Russian probe . In other words , the president must surely be a Russian agent if it can be shown that he wanted to halt the Russian probe . According to the New York Times , Trump made two comments that served the FBI 's improper purpose . They are worth examining .
First , Trump wrote a letter to Comey thanking him for telling him three times that he was not under investigation . Comey later confirmed that he had , in fact , told the president he was not under investigation . Obviously , Trump wanted the American public to learn that he was not personally being investigated for Russian `` collusion . '' Yet , Comey refused to disclose this truth . How this letter can , therefore , be viewed plausibly as obstruction of an investigation is baffling . Trump wanted to promote the truth , not conceal it .
Second , Trump gave an interview to NBC News two days after Comey was dismissed in which he made reference to the Russia investigation . How is this evidence of obstruction ? It is not . As I explained in my book , `` A rigorous reading of what Trump said confirms that his intent was not to interfere with or end the Russia investigation , but to place someone who was neutral and competent in charge . '' In fact , Trump told NBC that he might want to lengthen the investigation to get to the bottom of any wrongdoing . This is hardly evidence of a corrupt purpose to interfere in an investigation as the law of obstruction demands .
The FBI 's illegitimate decision to begin an investigation of Trump as a Russian agent based on an obstruction premise was a false and fabricated excuse . This is shown by the testimony of McCabe who appeared before the Senate Intelligence committee after Comey was fired . He stated , `` There has been no effort to impede our investigation to date . '' Days later , Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told Congress , `` There never has been ... any political interference in any matter under my supervision in the Department of Justice . '' Six days before he was fired , Comey told the Senate Judiciary Committee that no one had told him to stop something for a political reason . `` It 's not happened in my experience , '' he said .
Not only did these key people involved in the Russia case affirm that the president never interfered or obstructed , there was no other evidence that Trump was working for the Russians that would have justified the FBI 's punitive decision to launch its investigation . Both Comey and Page testified before House investigators that by the time the director was fired and Special Counsel Robert Mueller was appointed there was no hard evidence of `` collusion . '' The investigation had been running for ten months . Comey admitted , `` In fact , when I was fired as director , I still did n't know whether there was anything to it . '' Nevertheless , top officials at the FBI opened their investigation of Trump in May of 2017 without sufficient evidence and in direct violation of FBI and DOJ regulations . They broke the law . And they did it to depose Trump .
The FBI was not alone in its attempt to remove Trump from office . According to another New York Times story , Rosenstein also sought retribution by proposing to secretly record the president in an attempt to gain some damaging information about him . He allegedly suggested that he and others wear hidden devices to record their conversations with Trump and discussed recruiting Cabinet members to remove him under the Constitution 's 25th Amendment . Three top FBI officials confirmed various elements of Rosenstein 's efforts to mount the equivalent of a palace coup . The Deputy Attorney General has consistently resisted requests by Congress to question him about his actions .
It is now undeniable that critical decisions made by senior FBI leadership were driven by political bias and personal animus , not sustainable facts or credible evidence . These powerful officials could not abide that Donald Trump had emerged , against their wishes , as the duly elected president of the United States . They could not accept that he had unceremoniously shown Comey the door . In an act of rank retaliation , they decided to abuse their positions of power to drive him from office . They invented facts and ignored the law to subvert our system of justice and undermine the democratic process . They compromised essential principles and betrayed the nation 's trust . Their conduct was , and is , unconscionable .
When William Barr takes office as our nation 's next Attorney General , he must review their actions and present all evidence of wrongdoing to federal prosecutors and , if appropriate , a grand jury . When the people we entrust to enforce the law become the lawbreakers , they must be held accountable . No one is above the law .","Dishonesty and corruption are endemic at the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Bureau agents uncovered no evidence that Trump had somehow conspired or coordinated with Russia to influence the election. Then came the firing of Comey for just cause. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, Comey's direct boss, volunteered to author a memorandum recommending his termination for multiple acts of misconduct and serious violations of Justice Department and FBI rules in the Clinton case. Six former Attorneys General and Deputy Attorneys General from different eras and both political parties endorsed his termination. Comey was canned for reasons that were entirely merited and had nothing whatsoever to do with the Russia probe. The president was constitutionally authorized to take such action, which Comey confirmed in a letter to his colleagues at the FBI.

As I noted in my book, ""Almost immediately, demands for impeachment of President Trump were heard in the corridors of Congress. The liberal media were crazed with excitement over the prospect that the president had obstructed justice in trying to block the Russian investigation. In truth and in law, neither scenarios were remotely rational.""

When the people we entrust to enforce the law become the lawbreakers, they must be held accountable.

Among those who were aggrieved over Comey's firing was his loyal lieutenant, Andrew McCabe, who became Acting FBI Director, as well as bureau lawyer Lisa Page and her paramour, Peter Strzok, a top counterintelligence agent. Page and Strzok were intimately involved in the ""collusion"" investigation and were virulently opposed to the president both politically and personally, as evidence by their numerous anti-Trump text messages.

In the eight-day period after Comey's termination, top officials at the FBI decided to take action. They would originate a counterintelligence investigation of Trump for being a foreign agent of Russia. Critically, they had no evidence or even reasonable suspicion to support their operation. They simply despised Trump and chose to misuse their positions of power in an illegal act of reprisal.

Once again, the FBI needed a pretext.They coalesced around the idea that Comey's firing might constitute obstruction of justice if it was intended to stop or impede the original Russian probe. In other words, the president must surely be a Russian agent if it can be shown that he wanted to halt the Russian probe. According to the New York Times, Trump made two comments that served the FBI's improper purpose. They are worth examining.

First, Trump wrote a letter to Comey thanking him for telling him three times that he was not under investigation. Comey later confirmed that he had, in fact, told the president he was not under investigation. Obviously, Trump wanted the American public to learn that he was not personally being investigated for Russian ""collusion."" Yet, Comey refused to disclose this truth. How this letter can, therefore, be viewed plausibly as obstruction of an investigation is baffling. Trump wanted to promote the truth, not conceal it.

Second, Trump gave an interview to NBC News two days after Comey was dismissed in which he made reference to the Russia investigation. How is this evidence of obstruction? It is not. As I explained in my book, ""A rigorous reading of what Trump said confirms that his intent was not to interfere with or end the Russia investigation, but to place someone who was neutral and competent in charge."" In fact, Trump told NBC that he might want to lengthen the investigation to get to the bottom of any wrongdoing. This is hardly evidence of a corrupt purpose to interfere in an investigation as the law of obstruction demands.

The FBI's illegitimate decision to begin an investigation of Trump as a Russian agent based on an obstruction premise was a false and fabricated excuse. This is shown by the testimony of McCabe who appeared before the Senate Intelligence committee after Comey was fired. He stated, ""There has been no effort to impede our investigation to date."" Days later, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told Congress, ""There never has been...any political interference in any matter under my supervision in the Department of Justice."" Six days before he was fired, Comey told the Senate Judiciary Committee that no one had told him to stop something for a political reason. ""It's not happened in my experience,"" he said.

Not only did these key people involved in the Russia case affirm that the president never interfered or obstructed, there was no other evidence that Trump was working for the Russians that would have justified the FBI's punitive decision to launch its investigation. Both Comey and Page testified before House investigators that by the time the director was fired and Special Counsel Robert Mueller was appointed there was no hard evidence of ""collusion."" The investigation had been running for ten months. Comey admitted, ""In fact, when I was fired as director, I still didn't know whether there was anything to it."" Nevertheless, top officials at the FBI opened their investigation of Trump in May of 2017 without sufficient evidence and in direct violation of FBI and DOJ regulations. They broke the law. And they did it to depose Trump.

The FBI was not alone in its attempt to remove Trump from office. According to another New York Times story, Rosenstein also sought retribution by proposing to secretly record the president in an attempt to gain some damaging information about him. He allegedly suggested that he and others wear hidden devices to record their conversations with Trump and discussed recruiting Cabinet members to remove him under the Constitution's 25th Amendment. Three top FBI officials confirmed various elements of Rosenstein's efforts to mount the equivalent of a palace coup. The Deputy Attorney General has consistently resisted requests by Congress to question him about his actions.

It is now undeniable that critical decisions made by senior FBI leadership were driven by political bias and personal animus, not sustainable facts or credible evidence. These powerful officials could not abide that Donald Trump had emerged, against their wishes, as the duly elected president of the United States. They could not accept that he had unceremoniously shown Comey the door. In an act of rank retaliation, they decided to abuse their positions of power to drive him from office. They invented facts and ignored the law to subvert our system of justice and undermine the democratic process. They compromised essential principles and betrayed the nation's trust. Their conduct was, and is, unconscionable.

When William Barr takes office as our nation's next Attorney General, he must review their actions and present all evidence of wrongdoing to federal prosecutors and, if appropriate, a grand jury. When the people we entrust to enforce the law become the lawbreakers, they must be held accountable. No one is above the law.

“It was the right thing to do. The facts were pretty clear on it. He made a big mistake and he testified only a few weeks before the termination that he would do it again [announce reopening the Clinton probe] if he had the opportunity,” Sessions said.

McCabe wasn’t fired until March of this year, following a separate inspector general finding that he leaked a self-serving story to the press and later lied about it to Comey and federal investigators.

The Clinton campaign has for months thought the worst of the email server controversy was over . In July , to their great relief , FBI Director James Comey said that Clinton would not face criminal charges for sending emails over a private server while secretary of state .
But whatever new emails authorities have found are apparently enough to trigger a second look at whether she broke the law . Comey ’ s letter to Congress on Friday doesn ’ t say much , but it does at least suggest that the FBI is still looking into whether Clinton violated federal law by sending classified email over her private server . ( Comey said the FBI had come across new emails in “ an unrelated case , ” and that the bureau will review them “ to determine whether they contain classified information , as well as to assess their importance to our investigation ” into Clinton . )
There ’ s a lot we don ’ t know yet . But , citing anonymous sources , multiple news outlets have reported that these emails are from “ a device ” belonging to Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband Anthony Weiner and were discovered via an unrelated investigation .
Of course , the new line of investigation does not necessarily mean that Clinton broke the law . With less than two weeks until the election , Comey ’ s letter to Congress will lead to ferocious new partisan attacks over her private server . ( Donald Trump is already making them . ) We have no more proof that Clinton broke the law today than we did yesterday . All we know is that Comey has new records he thinks are worthy of further investigation .
That said , it ’ s important to be clear about just why Clinton ’ s email server is now one of the biggest stories of the 2016 presidential campaign . And to understand that , you have to understand why she was under investigation in the first place .
One of the big challenges in writing about the “ Hillary Clinton email controversy ” is that it ’ s one overly broad category that ’ s being used to capture several distinct accusations against the Democratic presidential nominee .
The shorthand “ Hillary ’ s emails , ” though somewhat irresistible , suggests a single controversy that is somehow both monolithic and strangely sprawling . The reality is that there are actually four ( or , if you include claims of a cover-up , five ; or , if you include Benghazi , six ) distinct controversies that involve both Clinton and email . Indeed , there are several separate groups of emails , and some of the accusations against Clinton are contradictory .
To understand what ’ s happening , it ’ s useful to split up these controversies rather than lump them together :
One controversy related to Clinton ’ s emails is that she exchanged classified information over a private server that was susceptible to hacking by foreign agents . This is an issue about cybersecurity — that Clinton didn ’ t do enough to safeguard government secrets . This is what the FBI ’ s investigation is about , and what appears to be behind Comey ’ s new investigation . The FBI has discovered a new set of emails — apparently emerging from its separate inquiry into Anthony Weiner — that is making it look again at this question of whether Clinton broke a law .
Another claim is that Clinton ’ s private server allowed her to avoid public records laws . This is a controversy related to the idea of transparency — that government officials have to keep records of their work , and that Clinton deliberately avoided doing so .
Separately , emails from Clinton ’ s aides have also fed into different controversies about the Clinton Foundation and the Benghazi compound attack . At heart , these stories are about donor access and foreign policy .
More recently , there ’ s also the internal Clinton campaign emails revealed by WikiLeaks . These , generally speaking , have nothing to do with any of the emails above .
It ’ s crucial to separate these investigations in your head to understand the significance of the FBI ’ s investigation . The FBI was mostly concerned — and , according to today ’ s announcement , remains concerned — that Clinton took risks by using a private server to expose state secrets that could be obtained by malicious foreign actors .
In July , the FBI said its investigation into Clinton looked at whether “ classified information was improperly stored or transmitted on ( her ) personal system , in violation of a federal statute making it a felony to mishandle classified information either intentionally or in a grossly negligent way , ” or if she broke a second law making it illegal to “ knowingly remove classified information from appropriate systems or storage facilities. ” We have no idea if the new emails will provide evidence of that , but it appears to be what the FBI will be looking at .
It ’ s not in dispute that Clinton used a private email account and a `` homebrew '' private email server exclusively during her four years as secretary of state .
In doing so , she wound up exchanging emails containing classified information over communications systems that did not have the safeguards of the government . In all , Clinton sent or received more than 100 emails considered classified — seven of which were marked `` top secret '' — on the private server installed in her family ’ s home in Westchester , New York .
The FBI ’ s investigation , the records of which were released in September in a 58-page report , makes clear there ’ s no direct proof that `` hostile agents '' penetrated Clinton ’ s private server . And as ███ ’ s Dylan Matthews has noted , prosecutors would need evidence not just that Clinton sent classified information outside secure government networks but that she did so knowing that it was supposed to be classified . That ’ s the standard the FBI needs to prove Clinton broke the law .
Clinton has denied this , insisting that any classified material in the emails was classified after the fact or she did not realize it had been classified . And the FBI had cleared Clinton of the charge that she had knowingly sent classified information .
But even short of committing a crime , Comey has also made clear that Clinton ’ s private server made it more vulnerable to foreign hackers , that outside actors repeatedly tried to break into her email account , and that exchanging classified email over private servers at all was `` extremely careless . ''
Trump has suggested that China and/or Russia have actually obtained Clinton ’ s emails . That is , characteristically , a dramatic overstatement of the facts . But the claim that Clinton ’ s decision to use a private server really did give foreign hackers a greater opportunity to find classified information is hard to dismiss out of hand . As ███ ’ s Timothy Lee has written , hackers are really good at covering their tracks if they don ’ t want to be discovered . The New York Times interviewed several cybersecurity experts in July , and they all concluded that it was probable Clinton ’ s server was indeed hacked .
There have been three main defenses to this line of criticism .
The first is that much of the `` classified '' information exchanged almost certainly didn ’ t actually risk exposing national security secrets . That ’ s because the US government has a notoriously broad classification system that treats anodyne information ( or information that ’ s already public ) as secret .
`` My standard joke is that the NSA is so crazy they classify their lunch menu , '' says James Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington . `` Was it a bad idea to set up a private server ? Probably . Did it hurt national security or cause any real damage ? We certainly can ’ t conclude that . ''
The second defense , noted to me in an email by Steven Aftergood of the Project on Government Secrecy , is that the State Department server may not really have been that much safer than the private servers . After all , State 's own servers were successfully breached in 2006 and then again in 2015 — so maybe Clinton 's emails were actually safer on the private server ?
The third defense is also persuasive : Private accounts are pretty routine for government officials . A 2009 email sent by then-Secretary of State Colin Powell , released Wednesday , suggests that Powell frequently used a private server to communicate with foreign governments . ( Powell ’ s private server wasn ’ t a `` homebrew , '' but it was still outside the government ’ s systems . )
Critics have correctly said that Clinton ’ s use of her server appeared to go further than that of other government officials , but the Powell revelation makes this controversy look like a broader indictment of a broken email system — with Clinton being singled out unfairly as a particularly bad example .
Those defenses may be persuasive on the merits .

Understanding the confusion surrounding the “Hillary Clinton email controversy”

One of the big challenges in writing about the “Hillary Clinton email controversy” is that it’s one overly broad category that’s being used to capture several distinct accusations against the Democratic presidential nominee.

The shorthand “Hillary’s emails,” though somewhat irresistible, suggests a single controversy that is somehow both monolithic and strangely sprawling.

Separately, emails from Clinton’s aides have also fed into different controversies about the Clinton Foundation and the Benghazi compound attack. At heart, these stories are about donor access and foreign policy.

More recently, there’s also the internal Clinton campaign emails revealed by WikiLeaks. These, generally speaking, have nothing to do with any of the emails above.

Did Clinton knowingly send classified information?

It’s not in dispute that Clinton used a private email account and a ""homebrew"" private email server exclusively during her four years as secretary of state.

In doing so, she wound up exchanging emails containing classified information over communications systems that did not have the safeguards of the government. In all, Clinton sent or received more than 100 emails considered classified — seven of which were marked ""top secret"" — on the private server installed in her family’s home in Westchester, New York.

The FBI’s investigation, the records of which were released in September in a 58-page report, makes clear there’s no direct proof that ""hostile agents"" penetrated Clinton’s private server. And as Vox’s Dylan Matthews has noted, prosecutors would need evidence not just that Clinton sent classified information outside secure government networks but that she did so knowing that it was supposed to be classified. That’s the standard the FBI needs to prove Clinton broke the law.

Clinton has denied this, insisting that any classified material in the emails was classified after the fact or she did not realize it had been classified. And the FBI had cleared Clinton of the charge that she had knowingly sent classified information.

But even short of committing a crime, Comey has also made clear that Clinton’s private server made it more vulnerable to foreign hackers, that outside actors repeatedly tried to break into her email account, and that exchanging classified email over private servers at all was ""extremely careless.""

Trump has suggested that China and/or Russia have actually obtained Clinton’s emails. That is, characteristically, a dramatic overstatement of the facts. But the claim that Clinton’s decision to use a private server really did give foreign hackers a greater opportunity to find classified information is hard to dismiss out of hand.

Why Clinton’s camp thinks these charges are ridiculous

Part of the problem , it seems , is with the way Trump dismissed Comey — namely , out of the blue and without so much as an opportunity to save face . As one source told The Los Angeles Times , Comey was `` caught flat-footed '' and only learned of his termination from a TV news report while speaking to FBI agents in Los Angeles .
As former FBI agent Lewis Schiliro told Politico , `` I think the way it was done was not real nice . He could have asked for his resignation and given him a little bit of time to bow out gracefully . '' Another senior official told the site that `` we were caught totally off guard . '' Yet another official told Politico that `` no one knew this was coming . Everyone is just shocked that this happened . ''
Another problem is that the timing of Comey 's firing raises questions about whether it was the result of the bureau 's ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign 's alleged relationship with Russia .
As one official told Politico , `` Everyone is asking , ‘ Why now ? What is the reason for doing it now ? ’ If this had happened immediately after the election , that would be one thing . Everyone was thinking it may happen then . But now ? People keep asking if it ’ s because of Russia . ''
Another agent said that `` the working agents don ’ t like the way the FBI has been portrayed over the last six or eight or 10 months . I think this will be very tough . It ’ s really going to require a non-politicized effort to ensure the current investigations are allowed to proceed without any interference . ''
None of this has stopped one of Trump 's greatest media boosters , Fox News host Sean Hannity , from praising the decision on the grounds that Comey was a `` national embarrassment '' for his handling of the Hillary Clinton email scandal . Hannity also tweeted on Wednesday that he believed many rank-and-file FBI agents were happy at the decision .","Agents who work for the FBI are reported to be devastated at President Donald Trump's decision to fire FBI Director James Comey.

As one source told The Los Angeles Times, Comey was ""caught flat-footed"" and only learned of his termination from a TV news report while speaking to FBI agents in Los Angeles.

As former FBI agent Lewis Schiliro told Politico, ""I think the way it was done was not real nice. He could have asked for his resignation and given him a little bit of time to bow out gracefully."" Another senior official told the site that ""we were caught totally off guard."" Yet another official told Politico that ""no one knew this was coming. Everyone is just shocked that this happened.""

Another problem is that the timing of Comey's firing raises questions about whether it was the result of the bureau's ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign's alleged relationship with Russia.

As one official told Politico, ""Everyone is asking, ‘Why now? What is the reason for doing it now?’ If this had happened immediately after the election, that would be one thing. Everyone was thinking it may happen then. But now? People keep asking if it’s because of Russia.""

Another agent said that ""the working agents don’t like the way the FBI has been portrayed over the last six or eight or 10 months. I think this will be very tough. It’s really going to require a non-politicized effort to ensure the current investigations are allowed to proceed without any interference.""

None of this has stopped one of Trump's greatest media boosters, Fox News host Sean Hannity, from praising the decision on the grounds that Comey was a ""national embarrassment"" for his handling of the Hillary Clinton email scandal. Hannity also tweeted on Wednesday that he believed many rank-and-file FBI agents were happy at the decision.

Manafort , a criminal defendant fighting two separate cases , is uniquely positioned to try to dredge up information on bias or potential overreach by FBI and Justice Department officials who have played roles in special counsel Robert Mueller ’ s probe of ties between the Trump campaign and Russia .
Whether Manafort will seek to uncover and spotlight disparaging details about federal officials , potentially including an FBI agent dismissed from Mueller ’ s team last year , has become the subject of speculation and anticipation by lawyers involved in the Russia investigation .
“ This is something we ’ ve all been talking about , ” said one defense attorney representing a witness in Mueller ’ s probe . “ It ’ s a hard question . ”
Some expect Manafort to take a slash-and-burn approach . “ I think they ’ re going to try to throw any dirt possible , ” said former federal prosecutor Randall Eliason . “ If he ’ s going to trial , then I would expect it to be an all-out war , and I wouldn ’ t be surprised if they try to make those kinds of claims that the prosecution is tainted . ”

An aggressive claim of bias by Manafort is unlikely to derail the prosecution that now threatens him with the prospect of spending the rest of his life behind bars . It would also bring some risk : Lawyers warn that it could anger the judges presiding over his cases , who might see the strategy as a frivolous diversion that could drag the trials into a political morass .
But such moves could also draw public attention to alleged abuses by federal investigators , whom some congressional Republicans have accused of a brazen anti-Trump vendetta . That might draw the attention and sympathy of President Donald Trump , from whom Manafort may be hoping to win a pardon .
“ The degree to which he can show broader FBI misconduct in his investigation can lay a foundation for a pardon , ” said George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley . “ Thus far , Manafort has not been able to benefit from the controversy surrounding the FBI . To the extent he can make himself part of that narrative , it can only help him — certainly with the president . ”
Manafort is facing numerous charges related to his political work for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine , including money laundering , bank fraud , tax evasion and failing to disclose that he was lobbying for a foreign power . Democrats also suspect that Manafort may have been a key intermediary between the 2016 Trump campaign and Kremlin agents .
With deadlines looming for pretrial motions , many lawyers say that for Manafort , the risk of raising the misconduct issue in court is well worth taking .
“ I don ’ t see a particular downside , other than angering the judge , ” said Solomon Wisenberg , a defense attorney and former deputy independent counsel in the Whitewater investigation who noted that Manafort ’ s team has already irritated one presiding judge .
Manafort ’ s defense could allege outrageous government conduct , but such motions rarely prevail . Demands for details on any malfeasance by investigators and attorneys who have worked on the case might stand a better chance , lawyers say .
Prosecutors have told the federal judges overseeing the pair of cases against Manafort that they are nearly finished turning over relevant information about his alleged crimes . That process would typically include documents , witness statements , FBI reports and more .
Prosecutors are obliged to give defense attorneys any evidence that tends to show a defendant ’ s innocence — so-called exculpatory evidence — or otherwise bolster his defense , including information undercutting the credibility of government witnesses .
However , those basic principles leave room for disagreement — including over how prosecutors should handle derogatory information about an investigator removed from the case for alleged bias or malfeasance but who will not take the witness stand .
That could describe FBI agent Peter Strzok , whom Mueller removed from his team last summer over texts he exchanged with an FBI lawyer in 2016 that were harshly critical of Trump . Strzok had a senior role in the Russia investigation , although it is not clear how involved he was in Manafort ’ s case .

Mccarthy, John Mccormack, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Mairead Mcardle, Robert Verbruggen, Carrie Severino, Tobias Hoonhout, John Fund, Rich Lowry","What do you do with an FBI agent , sworn to uphold the law , who flagrantly violates the law in a rogue investigation aimed at making a name for himself by bringing down some high-profile targets ?
At least that is the way the Justice Department answered that question in the case of David Chaves , an FBI agent who serially and lawlessly leaked grand-jury information , wiretap evidence , and other sensitive investigative intelligence to the media in his quest to make an insider-trading case against some celebrities . And when finally called on it , the Justice Department circled the wagons : proceeding with its tainted prosecution , referring the now-retired Chaves for an internal investigation that has gone exactly nowhere after nearly two years , and using legal maneuvers to block the courts and the public from scrutinizing the scope of the misconduct .
It has become a refrain among defenders of the FBI and Justice Department that critics are trying to destroy these vital institutions . In point of fact , these agencies are doing yeoman ’ s work destroying themselves — much to the chagrin of those of us who spent much of our professional lives proudly carrying out their mission .
The problem is not the existence of miscreants ; they are an inevitable part of the human condition , from which no institution of any size will ever be immune . The challenge today is the ethos of law-enforcement . You see it in texts expressing disdain for lawmakers ; in the above-it-all contempt for legislative oversight ; in arrogant flouting of the Gang of Eight disclosure process for sensitive intelligence ( because the FBI ’ s top-tier unilaterally decides when Bureau activities are “ too sensitive ” to discuss ) ; in rogue threats to turn the government ’ s law-enforcement powers against Congress ; and in the imperious self-perception of a would-be fourth branch of government , insulated from and unaccountable to the others — including its actual executive-branch superiors .
Once law enforcement saw the virtue in self-policing , in a duty to expose and purge itself of rogue actors . Now , it tends toward not just burying bad behavior but — the best defense being a good offense — hiding it behind claims of a job well done , behind claims that its ends are so noble its means are justified no matter how unseemly .
In the years after the “ Great Recession , ” progressives were frustrated by the incapacity of prosecutors to hold financial institutions responsible for the subprime-mortgage crisis and the housing crash , to which government policies had contributed mightily . One response was a flurry of securities-fraud investigations : If you can ’ t nail the evil banks , at least nail big-time market players , even if less than compelling evidence needs propping up by extravagant legal theories .
Among those who found themselves on the FBI ’ s radar were three celebrities : investor Carl Icahn , pro golfer Phil Mickelson , and sports gambler Billy Walters . In early 2011 , for example , Icahn made a $ 10.2 billion bid on Clorox Co. , triggering what investigators regarded as suspicious stock trading . In particular , they eyed Walters , who was known to talk stocks with Icahn and give investment advice to Mickelson .
But they had nothing , and the investigation stalled . Two years later , the effort was described as “ dormant ” by David Chaves , the supervising FBI agent for a squad handling big-time insider-trading investigations in Manhattan ( where the Bureau ’ s headquarters is just a five-minute walk to Wall Street ) . Working in conjunction with the U.S. attorney ’ s office for the Southern District of New York ( SDNY ) , agent Chaves and his subordinates had aggressively used a federal grand jury to investigate Walters , and had even obtained court orders enabling agents to monitor phone calls — a burdensome commitment of time and public resources , generally reserved for conspiracy cases involving insulated mega-crooks who orchestrate major felonies . But it was to no avail .
There is more crime than federal law enforcement ’ s finite resources can handle . So when an investigation yields nothing after a reasonable time — to say nothing of two years— it is usually deemed time to move on to more-fruitful cases . But not for agent Chaves . He doubled down with a new strategy : strategic leaks of grand jury , surveillance , and other sensitive investigative information to select journalists .
In 2013 , Chaves began arranging phone calls , meetings in restaurants , and other modes of communication with reporters for the New York Times and Wall Street Journal . Although federal law criminalizes the disclosure of grand-jury and sealed wiretap information , details of the probe were expansively revealed to the press : the targets of the investigation ; the stocks in which they traded and specific transactions that were being scrutinized ; the investigative techniques that were being used and that were under consideration ; and potential prosecution theories of insider trading .
The FBI ’ s goal was twofold . First came intelligence-gathering : improper quid pro quo arrangements in which Chaves exchanged details from the government ’ s investigation for information from the journalists — in essence , trying to turn reporters , who are not subject to FBI guidelines and protocols , into sources .
Second , the Bureau hoped that the pressure generated by media coverage would “ tickle the wire. ” This is a venerable law-enforcement expression for sudden events that panic conspirators into blurting out incriminating statements on tapped phones . Unexpected developments — e.g. , the disappearance or arrest of a conspirator , a price spike or crash — can yield valuable evidence of association , pecking order , and consciousness of guilt . . . but investigators are not supposed to bait their targets with lawless leaks to the media . Here , Chaves hoped for a windfall from the press coverage — it would get the phones humming , ratcheting up pressure on accomplices to “ flip ” and become cooperating witnesses .
The public media blitz began in late May 2014 , with major stories in the Journal and the Times about how Icahn , Mickelson , and Walters were under the federal microscope for a scheme involving Icahn ’ s investments in Clorox — a scheme for which there was apparently scant evidence and no coherent insider-trading prosecution theory .
No Clorox case was ever brought . In fact , on June 11 , a few days after the initial report , the Timesconceded that it had been misled by its ( unidentified ) law-enforcement source and that the FBI , in fact , had no evidence that Mickelson had traded Clorox stock while Icahn was preparing to bid for the company . One Times reporter actually called the U.S. attorney ’ s office to complain that his source — whom prosecutors suspected was an agent — had lied to the media . ( Who knew there was a Code of Ethics for leaking ! )
As the continuing press coverage showed , the investigators ’ attention shifted from Clorox to a company called Dean Foods , which had a promising subsidiary called White Wave . Consistent with much market speculation , White Wave was spun off from Dean Foods in 2012 . Walters , it turns out , was friendly with Tom Davis , chairman of the Dean Foods board , and traded heavily in the stock .
At one point , after FBI agents approached Walters but he declined to speak with them , an article appeared in the Times the following day , outlining new details about the investigation and Walters ’ s trading patterns . The FBI sought cooperation from Davis , too , but he repeatedly denied engaging in any wrongdoing with Walters . In August 2015 , “ people familiar with the investigation ” identified Davis to the Journal as a target who had tipped Walters to the White Wave spinoff and other inside information . The humiliating public revelation cost Davis his job and , according to Walters , drove him into the arms of the FBI .
Davis agreed to cooperate and plead guilty . After five years of FBI pursuit , Walters was indicted for insider trading based on allegations that tips from Davis netted him over $ 40 million ( in combined profits and avoided losses ) . He was eventually tried and convicted . Mickelson , who traded in Dean Foods stock largely based on advice from Walters , was not charged ; he paid a nearly $ 1 million settlement to the SEC and avoided testifying in Walters ’ s trial by announcing that he would assert his privilege against self-incrimination if called .
There is irrefutable evidence that high-ranking officials in the FBI and SDNY were aware when the leaks began in 2014 that they were coming from law enforcement . Significant efforts were made to persuade the Journal and the Times to delay their initial reports . On the day when they began appearing , George Venizelos , then the agent in charge of the FBI ’ s New York field office , emailed his underlings that contacts with the Journal must stop “ for now ” :
Just stop talking to this reporter for now ! If we don ’ t have enough evidence by now its [ sic ] over . I mean it when I say cease contact with this reporter for now , if I find out someone is still talking to this reporter after today than [ sic ] there will be reassignments immediately .
They didn ’ t have enough evidence but , as we ’ ve seen , it wasn ’ t over .
When a follow-up Journal report indicated that publicity about the investigation had undermined the use of wiretaps , the SDNY ’ s then–U.S . attorney Preet Bharara emailed Venizelos to lament that “ these leaks are outrageous and harmful , ” and to suggest that they jointly take corrective action . An angry Venizelos forwarded Bharara ’ s email to his underlings , grousing that the “ not good ” situation was now a “ bad ” one , and ordered a meeting the following morning .
Subsequently , top SDNY officials discussed the astonishing revelation that , when the Times had to retract its initial accusation against Mickelson , not only did reporter Ben Protess complain about having “ to walk back his story ” ; Protess also described being threatened by the FBI . The reporter told the SDNY that his source “ did not like being called out for lying or the story being walked back ” ; the source had also become “ a bit threatening , ” warning Protess that he and the Times were now “ on the radar. ” With the investigation ongoing , the SDNY decided that the time was not right to discuss the situation “ generally , ” but that “ obviously we need to discuss and will need to address this with the FBI . ”
Clearly , this level of alarm was appropriate , yet it does not appear to have resulted in any meaningful corrective action . Chaves kept leaking investigative information to his media sources . And there are significant reasons to believe the leaks went well beyond the Walters investigation — when a top government official is an incorrigible leaker , it is virtually never confined to one case . But here ’ s the kicker : By the end of 2014 , Chaves was promoted , becoming the head of all white-collar FBI investigations in New York .
When the government was finally called out for the outrageous leaking , its first reaction was to deny , deny , deny .
In September 2016 , after being indicted , Walters filed a motion seeking a hearing to explore a pattern of government misconduct , including “ leaking grand jury information to the press , as part of a concerted effort to breathe life into a flagging investigation. ” The SDNY indignantly replied that Walters ’ s allegations were “ false ” and “ baseless ” ; further , prosecutors insisted that Walters “ can not show that the source of the information contained in the articles was an agent or attorney for the Government , ” and that “ the natural and logical inferences lead to the conclusion that the source was not a Government official . ”
The huffing and puffing proved futile . Federal district judge P. Kevin Castel declined to dismiss Walters ’ s motion and ordered a hearing .
Now forced to take the motion seriously , the government abruptly changed course . The SDNY admitted that agent Chaves had , in fact , disclosed to the media a “ significant amount of confidential information relating to the investigation. ” Taken aback , Judge Castel could not help but note the irony : “ Mr . Walters is charged with . . . tipping material nonpublic information to another . And to help support that case , the special agent apparently tipped material nonpublic information improperly to another . ”
Still , despite the gamesmanship piled atop the indefensible misconduct , the court withdrew its grant of a hearing . Judge Castel reasoned that the government ’ s concession made it unnecessary to air out the dirty laundry ; the only question was whether Walters could demonstrate that he had been prejudiced by the years of leaking , and the judge remarkably found that he had failed to do so .
In appealing his conviction , Walters has vigorously disputed this conclusion and mocked the Justice Department ’ s efforts to contain the damage . The effort to portray Chaves as the lone bad actor is belied , his lawyers point out , by the media stories that describe multiple sources . While the government vowed to the court that it would conduct a zealous investigation of Chaves , he has never been charged — notwithstanding that a year and a half has gone by and Judge Castel has threatened to appoint a private attorney to pursue a criminal contempt case . Walters further contends that , although the leaking went on for nearly two years , the SDNY ’ s investigation covered only three months ( around the time of the first press stories in May 2014 ) ; and while prosecutors represented that they had reviewed “ thousands of emails and text messages ” relevant to the dispute , they disclosed a grand total of just six .
Nor did the government dispute that the misconduct here was part of an extensive pattern spanning numerous other insider trading investigations in which information was leaked to the same Journal and Times reporters . Walters has identified at least five such investigations overseen by Chaves . The resulting articles span an eight-year period from 2009 to 2016 , and cover some of [ U.S. attorney ] Bharara ’ s most-touted insider trading prosecutions . They reveal vast quantities of “ inside information from the government , ” including “ the names of unindicted co-conspirators , ” their “ statements to investigators ” which “ hadn ’ t previously been reported , ” nonpublic “ subpoenas , ” “ meetings with defense lawyers , ” whether a “ probe ” was “ at an advanced stage , ” how the government was “ preparing to present evidence to the grand jury , ” and the nature and expected timing of the “ charges ” the government was “ preparing. ” The government has not disclosed what , if anything , it has done to investigate the leaks in these cases or identify other cases in which leaking occurred .
A little over a year ago , I wrote about another of these cases . It involved David Ganek and his hedge fund , Level Global . The government obtained a search warrant for the firm and alerted the media before the raid . Predictably , the reputational damage caused by publicity about Ganek ’ s status as a suspect destroyed the business . Yet , Ganek was never charged , and it appears that the government falsely represented in its search-warrant application that an informant had implicated him in insider trading .
At the time , I opined that investigative excesses and lawlessness are a serious problem best addressed by Congress and Justice Department leadership . The courts are limited to weighing the legal claims raised by parties to a litigation ; they are simply not equipped to investigate official misconduct , nor is it their responsibility . And indeed , since I posited that argument , Ganek ’ s lawsuit against the government has been dismissed on a finding that law-enforcement officials have immunity , and it is an open question whether the Second Circuit ( which dismissed Ganek ’ s claims ) will take action on the misconduct in Walters ’ s case .
Regrettably , the ensuing year has also exhibited Justice Department leadership more inclined to conceal and soft-pedal evidence of official wrongdoing than deal with it forthrightly and accountably . And no wonder . Just this week , the report on the Clinton emails investigation filed by the Justice Department ’ s inspector general included this stunning passage ( on page 430 , footnotes are omitted ) :
Although FBI policy strictly limits the employees who are authorized to speak to the media , we found that this policy appeared to be widely ignored during the period we reviewed . We identified numerous FBI employees , at all levels of the organization and with no official reason to be in contact with the media , who were nevertheless in frequent contact with reporters . The large number of FBI employees who were in contact with journalists during this time period impacted our ability to identify the sources of leaks . For example , during the periods we reviewed , we identified dozens of FBI employees that had contact with members of the media . . . . [ We also ] identified social interactions between FBI employees and journalists that were , at a minimum , inconsistent with FBI policy and Department ethics rules . For example , we identified instances where FBI employees received tickets to sporting events from journalists , went on golfing outings with media representatives , were treated to drinks and meals after work by reporters , and were the guests of journalists at nonpublic social events .
As in the Justice Department ’ s stonewalling of the congressional committees pressing for answers about investigative tactics in the Russia probe , if the president does not take remedial action and demand transparency , the disreputable behavior will continue , and public faith will continue to plummet .
For their part , if the Justice Department and FBI wish to maintain their standing as rule-of-law pillars in a free society , they need to stop whining about their critics — many of whom love these institutions . They need to start looking within .","(Yuri Gripas/Reuters)

And they won’t be solved by whining about criticism.

What do you do with an FBI agent, sworn to uphold the law, who flagrantly violates the law in a rogue investigation aimed at making a name for himself by bringing down some high-profile targets?

Why . . . you promote him, of course.

At least that is the way the Justice Department answered that question in the case of David Chaves, an FBI agent who serially and lawlessly leaked grand-jury information, wiretap evidence, and other sensitive investigative intelligence to the media in his quest to make an insider-trading case against some celebrities. And when finally called on it, the Justice Department circled the wagons: proceeding with its tainted prosecution, referring the now-retired Chaves for an internal investigation that has gone exactly nowhere after nearly two years, and using legal maneuvers to block the courts and the public from scrutinizing the scope of the misconduct.

The Ethos of Law Enforcement

It has become a refrain among defenders of the FBI and Justice Department that critics are trying to destroy these vital institutions. In point of fact, these agencies are doing yeoman’s work destroying themselves — much to the chagrin of those of us who spent much of our professional lives proudly carrying out their mission.

The problem is not the existence of miscreants; they are an inevitable part of the human condition, from which no institution of any size will ever be immune. The challenge today is the ethos of law-enforcement. You see it in texts expressing disdain for lawmakers; in the above-it-all contempt for legislative oversight; in arrogant flouting of the Gang of Eight disclosure process for sensitive intelligence (because the FBI’s top-tier unilaterally decides when Bureau activities are “too sensitive” to discuss); in rogue threats to turn the government’s law-enforcement powers against Congress; and in the imperious self-perception of a would-be fourth branch of government, insulated from and unaccountable to the others — including its actual executive-branch superiors.

Once law enforcement saw the virtue in self-policing, in a duty to expose and purge itself of rogue actors. Now, it tends toward not just burying bad behavior but — the best defense being a good offense — hiding it behind claims of a job well done, behind claims that its ends are so noble its means are justified no matter how unseemly.

In the years after the “Great Recession,” progressives were frustrated by the incapacity of prosecutors to hold financial institutions responsible for the subprime-mortgage crisis and the housing crash, to which government policies had contributed mightily. One response was a flurry of securities-fraud investigations: If you can’t nail the evil banks, at least nail big-time market players, even if less than compelling evidence needs propping up by extravagant legal theories.

Among those who found themselves on the FBI’s radar were three celebrities: investor Carl Icahn, pro golfer Phil Mickelson, and sports gambler Billy Walters. In early 2011, for example, Icahn made a $10.2 billion bid on Clorox Co., triggering what investigators regarded as suspicious stock trading. In particular, they eyed Walters, who was known to talk stocks with Icahn and give investment advice to Mickelson.

But they had nothing, and the investigation stalled. Two years later, the effort was described as “dormant” by David Chaves, the supervising FBI agent for a squad handling big-time insider-trading investigations in Manhattan (where the Bureau’s headquarters is just a five-minute walk to Wall Street). Working in conjunction with the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), agent Chaves and his subordinates had aggressively used a federal grand jury to investigate Walters, and had even obtained court orders enabling agents to monitor phone calls — a burdensome commitment of time and public resources, generally reserved for conspiracy cases involving insulated mega-crooks who orchestrate major felonies. But it was to no avail.

The FBI’s New Strategy: Strategic Leaks to Media

There is more crime than federal law enforcement’s finite resources can handle. So when an investigation yields nothing after a reasonable time — to say nothing of two years— it is usually deemed time to move on to more-fruitful cases. But not for agent Chaves. He doubled down with a new strategy: strategic leaks of grand jury, surveillance, and other sensitive investigative information to select journalists.

In 2013, Chaves began arranging phone calls, meetings in restaurants, and other modes of communication with reporters for the New York Times and Wall Street Journal. Although federal law criminalizes the disclosure of grand-jury and sealed wiretap information, details of the probe were expansively revealed to the press: the targets of the investigation; the stocks in which they traded and specific transactions that were being scrutinized; the investigative techniques that were being used and that were under consideration; and potential prosecution theories of insider trading.

The FBI’s goal was twofold. First came intelligence-gathering: improper quid pro quo arrangements in which Chaves exchanged details from the government’s investigation for information from the journalists — in essence, trying to turn reporters, who are not subject to FBI guidelines and protocols, into sources.

Second, the Bureau hoped that the pressure generated by media coverage would “tickle the wire.” This is a venerable law-enforcement expression for sudden events that panic conspirators into blurting out incriminating statements on tapped phones. Unexpected developments — e.g., the disappearance or arrest of a conspirator, a price spike or crash — can yield valuable evidence of association, pecking order, and consciousness of guilt . . . but investigators are not supposed to bait their targets with lawless leaks to the media. Here, Chaves hoped for a windfall from the press coverage — it would get the phones humming, ratcheting up pressure on accomplices to “flip” and become cooperating witnesses.

The public media blitz began in late May 2014, with major stories in the Journal and the Times about how Icahn, Mickelson, and Walters were under the federal microscope for a scheme involving Icahn’s investments in Clorox — a scheme for which there was apparently scant evidence and no coherent insider-trading prosecution theory.

No Clorox case was ever brought. In fact, on June 11, a few days after the initial report, the Timesconceded that it had been misled by its (unidentified) law-enforcement source and that the FBI, in fact, had no evidence that Mickelson had traded Clorox stock while Icahn was preparing to bid for the company. One Times reporter actually called the U.S. attorney’s office to complain that his source — whom prosecutors suspected was an agent — had lied to the media. (Who knew there was a Code of Ethics for leaking!)

As the continuing press coverage showed, the investigators’ attention shifted from Clorox to a company called Dean Foods, which had a promising subsidiary called White Wave. Consistent with much market speculation, White Wave was spun off from Dean Foods in 2012. Walters, it turns out, was friendly with Tom Davis, chairman of the Dean Foods board, and traded heavily in the stock.

At one point, after FBI agents approached Walters but he declined to speak with them, an article appeared in the Times the following day, outlining new details about the investigation and Walters’s trading patterns. The FBI sought cooperation from Davis, too, but he repeatedly denied engaging in any wrongdoing with Walters. In August 2015, “people familiar with the investigation” identified Davis to the Journal as a target who had tipped Walters to the White Wave spinoff and other inside information. The humiliating public revelation cost Davis his job and, according to Walters, drove him into the arms of the FBI.

Davis agreed to cooperate and plead guilty. After five years of FBI pursuit, Walters was indicted for insider trading based on allegations that tips from Davis netted him over $40 million (in combined profits and avoided losses). He was eventually tried and convicted. Mickelson, who traded in Dean Foods stock largely based on advice from Walters, was not charged; he paid a nearly $1 million settlement to the SEC and avoided testifying in Walters’s trial by announcing that he would assert his privilege against self-incrimination if called.

Circling the Wagons

There is irrefutable evidence that high-ranking officials in the FBI and SDNY were aware when the leaks began in 2014 that they were coming from law enforcement. Significant efforts were made to persuade the Journal and the Times to delay their initial reports. On the day when they began appearing, George Venizelos, then the agent in charge of the FBI’s New York field office, emailed his underlings that contacts with the Journal must stop “for now”:

Just stop talking to this reporter for now! If we don’t have enough evidence by now its [sic] over. I mean it when I say cease contact with this reporter for now, if I find out someone is still talking to this reporter after today than [sic] there will be reassignments immediately.

They didn’t have enough evidence but, as we’ve seen, it wasn’t over.

When a follow-up Journal report indicated that publicity about the investigation had undermined the use of wiretaps, the SDNY’s then–U.S. attorney Preet Bharara emailed Venizelos to lament that “these leaks are outrageous and harmful,” and to suggest that they jointly take corrective action. An angry Venizelos forwarded Bharara’s email to his underlings, grousing that the “not good” situation was now a “bad” one, and ordered a meeting the following morning.

Subsequently, top SDNY officials discussed the astonishing revelation that, when the Times had to retract its initial accusation against Mickelson, not only did reporter Ben Protess complain about having “to walk back his story”; Protess also described being threatened by the FBI. The reporter told the SDNY that his source “did not like being called out for lying or the story being walked back”; the source had also become “a bit threatening,” warning Protess that he and the Times were now “on the radar.” With the investigation ongoing, the SDNY decided that the time was not right to discuss the situation “generally,” but that “obviously we need to discuss and will need to address this with the FBI.”

Control the Damage . . . Or Repair It?

With his actions as an unregistered lobbyist for Turkey , his scheme to kidnap a Muslim cleric in exchange for a $ 15 million payoff , and failure to properly report multiple trips overseas—including one that involved a genuine Russian nuclear scheme—the list of potential charges against Flynn is lengthy . Flynn ’ s son is also exposed as a candidate for serious charges , considering his involvement in many of these deals .
But the plea that Flynn made on Friday admitted only lying to the FBI concerning his meetings with the Russian ambassador . The details of the plea are significant , in that they are directly tied to the Trump campaign and to Russia . However , while lying to the FBI can be a significant charge , it ’ s a charge rarely levied on its own ( see Martha Stewart ) .

If that wasn ’ t the same kind of idle nonsense that fills most of Flynn Jr. ’ s posts , it could indicate that there ’ s a bigger connection between Michael Flynn ’ s plea and that of George Papadopoulos : both may have been working with Mueller for a long time before that news became public .","News that former national security adviser Michael Flynn would plead guilty to lying to the FBI came after weeks of speculation surrounding potential charges and deals. With his actions as an unregistered lobbyist for Turkey, his scheme to kidnap a Muslim cleric in exchange for a $15 million payoff, and failure to properly report multiple trips overseas—including one that involved a genuine Russian nuclear scheme—the list of potential charges against Flynn is lengthy. Flynn’s son is also exposed as a candidate for serious charges, considering his involvement in many of these deals.

But the plea that Flynn made on Friday admitted only lying to the FBI concerning his meetings with the Russian ambassador. The details of the plea are significant, in that they are directly tied to the Trump campaign and to Russia. However, while lying to the FBI can be a significant charge, it’s a charge rarely levied on its own (see Martha Stewart).

However, multiple sources have indicated that Flynn and Mueller have concluded their agreement, suggesting that this may be the only charge Flynn faces. Which leads to the question of why? What kind of deal would allow Flynn and his son to walk away from multiple, serious charges with what could amount to little more than a slap on the wrist?

One clue is George Papadopoulos. His deal with Mueller also includes a charge of lying to the FBI. Which suggests that this is Mueller’s go-to charge for those who have agreed to cooperate with the investigation.

Another clue comes from Flynn Jr.

fbi,Wall Street Journal - News,1,https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-to-demand-investigation-into-whether-fbi-infiltrated-his-campaign-1526849292,Trump to Demand Investigation Into Whether FBI Infiltrated His Campaign,,"Rebecca Ballhaus, Peter Nicholas, Sadie Gurman, Rebecca.Ballhaus Wsj.Com, Peter.Nicholas Wsj.Com","WASHINGTON—The Justice Department asked its internal watchdog to examine if there was any impropriety in the counterintelligence investigation of President Donald Trump ’ s 2016 campaign , after the president demanded Sunday that the department investigate the motives behind the inquiry .
Earlier Sunday , in one of a series of tweets targeting the probe into whether Trump associates colluded with Russia during the 2016 campaign , Mr. Trump wrote : “ I hereby demand , and will do so officially tomorrow , that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration ! ”
Mr. Trump was referring to a man who approached at least two Trump campaign aides in 2016 in connection with the counterintelligence investigation into the campaign . Special counsel Robert Mueller took over that investigation last May when he was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein .
The Wall Street Journal has identified the suspected informant as Stefan Halper , an American who was a foreign policy scholar at the University of Cambridge until 2015 . Mr. Halper couldn ’ t be immediately reached for comment .
The Journal made no agreements to withhold his name from publication and is one of several media outlets identifying him . Some lawmakers and law-enforcement officials have expressed concern about compromising sources for the investigation , saying it could put lives in danger , hurt investigations and damage international partnerships .
Justice Department spokesperson Sarah Isgur Flores said Sunday afternoon that the agency had asked the inspector general to expand a probe into how the Federal Bureau of Investigation and federal prosecutors obtained warrants from the nation ’ s secret spy court to surveil a onetime Trump campaign aide . The goal , Ms. Flores said , is to examine “ whether there was any impropriety or political motivation in how the FBI conducted its counterintelligence investigation of persons suspected of involvement with the Russian agents who interfered in the 2016 presidential election . ”
Mr. Rosenstein said in a statement Sunday : “ If anyone did infiltrate or surveil participants in a presidential campaign for inappropriate purposes , we need to know about it and take appropriate action . ”
The move by the deputy attorney general to follow an extraordinary order by the president to probe an investigation into his own campaign is the latest turn in a struggle between the White House and the Justice Department . Mr. Trump has more than once considered firing Mr. Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions , who have survived in their roles in part by meeting the demands of the president or his supporters in Congress . Mr. Rosenstein oversees the Russia investigation .
Mr. Trump has railed against the investigation regularly in the year since it began and has stepped up his attacks in recent days . He and his lawyers have seized on reports about the informant as evidence in their view that the probe isn ’ t about Russia ’ s efforts to influence the election but rather a partisan attack leveled by a Democratic administration .
Former law-enforcement officials have said informants in a probe involving a presidential campaign should only be used for law-enforcement or foreign-intelligence purposes , not for political ends .
The president ’ s latest attacks come as his lawyers are seeking to negotiate the terms of a possible interview with Mr. Mueller , who already has indicted or secured guilty pleas from 19 individuals in the investigation , on charges including lying to investigators and tax and bank fraud .

Is it grounds for impeachment ? We asked a law professor to explain . Photo Illustration : Drew Evans/The Wall Street Journal .
Mr. Halper served in three Republican administrations , under former presidents Richard Nixon , Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan . During the Reagan administration , he served as a senior adviser to the Justice Department . He also served as an adviser to former President George H.W . Bush ’ s campaign , and later became a harsh critic of former President George W. Bush ’ s foreign policy , co-authoring a book on the subject in 2004 called “ America Alone . ”
Mr. Halper met with Trump campaign aides Carter Page and Sam Clovis , according to their lawyers . Mr . Page had been on the radar of U.S. counterintelligence officials for years over his dealings with Russia , and Mr. Clovis has met with Mr. Mueller ’ s prosecutors over his involvement with a onetime campaign adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians . Neither Mr . Page nor Mr. Clovis have been accused of wrongdoing .
Mr . Page confirmed the encounter , and a lawyer for Mr. Clovis said that he and Mr. Halper had only discussed China .
Presidents typically avoid ordering the Justice Department to undertake certain investigations and usually refrain from commenting on any ongoing probes to avoid the appearance of meddling in an investigation .
Mr. Trump has made no such efforts . He has attacked the Mueller investigation as a “ witch hunt ” —issuing seven tweets on the subject on Sunday morning alone—and has accused Mr. Mueller , a registered Republican , of having partisan motives . The special counsel is investigating possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia , as well as whether the president sought to obstruct justice . Mr. Trump has denied collusion and obstruction , and Moscow has denied election meddling .
The president has repeatedly alleged wrongdoing in the Russia investigation in the past .

Last year , Mr. Trump ’ s lawyers repeatedly said they expected the probe to close by the end of 2017 .","WASHINGTON—The Justice Department asked its internal watchdog to examine if there was any impropriety in the counterintelligence investigation of President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, after the president demanded Sunday that the department investigate the motives behind the inquiry.

Earlier Sunday, in one of a series of tweets targeting the probe into whether Trump associates colluded with Russia during the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump wrote: “I hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration!”

Mr. Trump was referring to a man who approached at least two Trump campaign aides in 2016 in connection with the counterintelligence investigation into the campaign. Special counsel Robert Mueller took over that investigation last May when he was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

The Wall Street Journal has identified the suspected informant as Stefan Halper, an American who was a foreign policy scholar at the University of Cambridge until 2015. Mr. Halper couldn’t be immediately reached for comment.

The Journal made no agreements to withhold his name from publication and is one of several media outlets identifying him. Some lawmakers and law-enforcement officials have expressed concern about compromising sources for the investigation, saying it could put lives in danger, hurt investigations and damage international partnerships.

Justice Department spokesperson Sarah Isgur Flores said Sunday afternoon that the agency had asked the inspector general to expand a probe into how the Federal Bureau of Investigation and federal prosecutors obtained warrants from the nation’s secret spy court to surveil a onetime Trump campaign aide. The goal, Ms. Flores said, is to examine “whether there was any impropriety or political motivation in how the FBI conducted its counterintelligence investigation of persons suspected of involvement with the Russian agents who interfered in the 2016 presidential election.”

Mr. Rosenstein said in a statement Sunday: “If anyone did infiltrate or surveil participants in a presidential campaign for inappropriate purposes, we need to know about it and take appropriate action.”

The move by the deputy attorney general to follow an extraordinary order by the president to probe an investigation into his own campaign is the latest turn in a struggle between the White House and the Justice Department. Mr. Trump has more than once considered firing Mr. Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who have survived in their roles in part by meeting the demands of the president or his supporters in Congress. Mr. Rosenstein oversees the Russia investigation.

Mr. Trump has railed against the investigation regularly in the year since it began and has stepped up his attacks in recent days. He and his lawyers have seized on reports about the informant as evidence in their view that the probe isn’t about Russia’s efforts to influence the election but rather a partisan attack leveled by a Democratic administration.

Former law-enforcement officials have said informants in a probe involving a presidential campaign should only be used for law-enforcement or foreign-intelligence purposes, not for political ends.

The president’s latest attacks come as his lawyers are seeking to negotiate the terms of a possible interview with Mr. Mueller, who already has indicted or secured guilty pleas from 19 individuals in the investigation, on charges including lying to investigators and tax and bank fraud.

Is it grounds for impeachment? We asked a law professor to explain. Photo Illustration: Drew Evans/The Wall Street Journal.

Mr. Halper served in three Republican administrations, under former presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan. During the Reagan administration, he served as a senior adviser to the Justice Department. He also served as an adviser to former President George H.W. Bush’s campaign, and later became a harsh critic of former President George W. Bush’s foreign policy, co-authoring a book on the subject in 2004 called “America Alone.”

Mr. Halper met with Trump campaign aides Carter Page and Sam Clovis, according to their lawyers. Mr. Page had been on the radar of U.S. counterintelligence officials for years over his dealings with Russia, and Mr. Clovis has met with Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors over his involvement with a onetime campaign adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians. Neither Mr. Page nor Mr. Clovis have been accused of wrongdoing.

Mr. Page confirmed the encounter, and a lawyer for Mr. Clovis said that he and Mr. Halper had only discussed China.

Presidents typically avoid ordering the Justice Department to undertake certain investigations and usually refrain from commenting on any ongoing probes to avoid the appearance of meddling in an investigation.

Mr. Trump has made no such efforts. He has attacked the Mueller investigation as a “witch hunt”—issuing seven tweets on the subject on Sunday morning alone—and has accused Mr. Mueller, a registered Republican, of having partisan motives. The special counsel is investigating possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, as well as whether the president sought to obstruct justice. Mr. Trump has denied collusion and obstruction, and Moscow has denied election meddling.

The president has repeatedly alleged wrongdoing in the Russia investigation in the past. In March 2017, he said he “just found out” that former President Barack Obama had ordered a wiretap on Trump Tower before the election, adding that Mr. Obama was a “bad (or sick) guy.” That assertion was widely discredited.

The president’s lawyers also have sought to use recent revelations about the alleged informant’s contacts with Trump campaign aides as a bargaining chip as they negotiate with Mr. Mueller’s team over the conditions of a possible interview with Mr. Trump.

Rudy Giuliani, one of the president’s lawyers, on Sunday said the special counsel about a month earlier had conveyed to him “as a possibility” that the investigation into whether the president obstructed justice could be wrapped up by Sept. 1 if Mr. Trump agreed to sit for an interview. Asked whether he believed the probe would end by that timeline, Mr. Giuliani said: “We hope.”

The president’s legal team previously has offered a number of end points they expected for the Mueller probe. Last year, Mr. Trump’s lawyers repeatedly said they expected the probe to close by the end of 2017.

WASHINGTON – Federal prosecutors recommended seeking criminal charges against Andrew McCabe, the former deputy director of the FBI and a frequent target of criticism by President Donald Trump, according to people familiar with the decision Thursday.

McCabe was fired from the FBI just before his retirement in March 2018 after the Justice Department's internal watchdog concluded that he improperly authorized a leak about a federal investigation into the Clinton Foundation in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign. Investigators concluded that he displayed a lack of candor when asked about the leak.

The U.S. attorney in Washington, Jessie Liu, recommended moving forward with unspecified charges against McCabe, according to people familiar with the situation who were not authorized to comment publicly. McCabe's lawyers appealed that decision to Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, who rejected their request, one of the people said. McCabe's lawyers were informed of that decision Thursday.

The decision clears the way for prosecutors to ask a grand jury to indict McCabe, though it was unclear Thursday whether that would happen. Whether McCabe is indicted will be up to a federal grand jury in Washington.

The U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington declined to comment.

The recommendation that McCabe be charged is the latest fallout from the FBI's handling of investigations around the 2016 presidential election, when agents investigated both of the major-party candidates. Those investigations – into Russian meddling to help Trump win the presidency and Democrat Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server – inserted the FBI into the center of fraught political controversies.

FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe had learned about the thousands of emails by Sept. 28 , 2016 , and Director James Comey informed Congress about them on Oct. 28 , 11 days before the presidential election , the messages show . Mr. Comey later said nothing in the new emails had changed the Federal Bureau of Investigation ’ s decision that Mrs. Clinton had committed no prosecutable offenses .
That lag is one focus of an investigation by the Justice Department ’ s inspector general , or in-house watchdog , into a variety of FBI actions in advance of the 2016 election , according to people familiar with the matter . Mr. McCabe stepped down this week , and FBI Director Christopher Wray in a note to bureau employees announcing Mr. McCabe ’ s departure also said he wouldn ’ t comment on the inspector-general probe . The Washington Post first reported the inspector general ’ s interest in the time lag .
Mr. McCabe has declined to comment on his departure and the inspector-general investigation .
In the text messages reviewed by the Journal , FBI agent Peter Strzok , who led the probe into Mrs. Clinton ’ s use of a private email server , told FBI lawyer Lisa Page on Sept. 28 that he had just been summoned to speak to Mr. McCabe about the newly discovered emails .
Agents in New York had found them on a laptop belonging to Anthony Weiner , a former congressman and husband of Huma Abedin , one of Mrs. Clinton ’ s closest advisers . The FBI was investigating Mr. Weiner for sexting a 15-year-old girl ; he would later plead guilty to transferring obscene material to a minor and was sentenced to 21 months in prison .
“ Got called up to Andy ’ s earlier , ” Mr. Strzok wrote in a Sept. 28 text . He continued : “ hundreds of thousands of emails turned over by Weiner ’ s atty to sdny , includes a ton of material from spouse . Sending team up tomorrow to review ... this will never end .... ” SDNY refers to the U.S. attorney ’ s office for the Southern District of New York , which was investigating Mr. Weiner .
Republicans and critics of the FBI have suggested the bureau may have sat on the emails to avoid hurting Mrs. Clinton before the Nov. 8 election . They are especially suspicious of Mr. McCabe , whose wife ran unsuccessfully for Virginia state Senate as a Democrat with the help of former Virginia Gov . Terry McAuliffe , a longtime Clinton ally .
Supporters of Mr. McCabe say it was natural for him to deliberate carefully about the significance of the newly discovered emails , which were later deemed irrelevant by investigators to the Clinton probe . Justice Department guidelines recommend against taking significant public actions shortly before an election that could sway the outcome .
Democrats say the true mistake was Mr. Comey ’ s decision in late October to tell Congress that the FBI was reopening its investigation into Mrs. Clinton due to the new emails , a move they blame in part for her election loss .
In the days after Mr. Comey ’ s disclosure , the FBI scrambled to get access to Mr. Weiner ’ s laptop so agents could search for the Clinton-related emails . Mr. Strzok , in texts over the next two days , referred to reviewing an affidavit . The FBI had to file an affidavit to get court approval in order to search for the Clinton-related emails , according to a search-warrant application that was unsealed in December 2016 .
Mr. Strzok and a team of agents spent the following Saturday , extending into Sunday morning , reviewing about 3,000 emails from the Weiner laptop , according to the text messages .
“ The three of us are going through the 3k ( 1000 each ) to narrow down so the team can come back tomorrow early . and de-dupe , ” Mr. Strzok wrote Ms . Page on Sunday , Nov. 6 , a reference to culling duplicate emails the FBI had previously seen .
“ Finishing up , ” he wrote just after 1 a.m. Sunday . “ Leaving finally now , ” he added 30 minutes later , noting that the agents had found “ no new classified ” emails .
That same day , Nov. 6—two days before the election—Mr . Comey wrote another letter to Congress saying nothing in the new emails had changed the FBI ’ s previous conclusion that no prosecution was merited .
Several months earlier , in July 2016 , Mr. Comey had called a news conference to say he was recommending that no charges be brought against Mrs. Clinton for the way she handled classified material on her private email server .
Of 30,000 work-related emails turned over by Mrs. Clinton ’ s lawyers to the State Department , about 110 were determined to have varying levels of classified material on them , Mr. Comey said then . He called the handling of such information by Mrs. Clinton and her aides “ extremely careless ” but not subject to prosecution .
The timing of Mr. McCabe ’ s departure this week was a surprise , although he was expected to depart before long because he is qualified to retire with full benefits in March .
In an email to the bureau ’ s 35,000 employees on Monday , Mr. Way said : “ It would be inappropriate for me to comment on specific aspects of the IG ’ s review right now . ”","Top FBI officials were aware for at least a month before alerting Congress that emails potentially related to an investigation of Hillary Clinton had emerged during a key stretch of the 2016 presidential campaign, according to text messages reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

That lag is one focus of an investigation by the Justice Department’s inspector general, or in-house watchdog, into a variety of FBI actions in advance of the 2016 election, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. McCabe stepped down this week, and FBI Director Christopher Wray in a note to bureau employees announcing Mr. McCabe’s departure also said he wouldn’t comment on the inspector-general probe. The Washington Post first reported the inspector general’s interest in the time lag.

Mr. McCabe has declined to comment on his departure and the inspector-general investigation.

In the text messages reviewed by the Journal, FBI agent Peter Strzok, who led the probe into Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email server, told FBI lawyer Lisa Page on Sept. 28 that he had just been summoned to speak to Mr. McCabe about the newly discovered emails.

Agents in New York had found them on a laptop belonging to Anthony Weiner, a former congressman and husband of Huma Abedin, one of Mrs. Clinton’s closest advisers. The FBI was investigating Mr. Weiner for sexting a 15-year-old girl; he would later plead guilty to transferring obscene material to a minor and was sentenced to 21 months in prison.

“Got called up to Andy’s earlier,” Mr. Strzok wrote in a Sept. 28 text. He continued: “hundreds of thousands of emails turned over by Weiner’s atty to sdny, includes a ton of material from spouse. Sending team up tomorrow to review ... this will never end ....” SDNY refers to the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York, which was investigating Mr. Weiner.

Republicans and critics of the FBI have suggested the bureau may have sat on the emails to avoid hurting Mrs. Clinton before the Nov. 8 election. They are especially suspicious of Mr. McCabe, whose wife ran unsuccessfully for Virginia state Senate as a Democrat with the help of former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a longtime Clinton ally.

Supporters of Mr. McCabe say it was natural for him to deliberate carefully about the significance of the newly discovered emails, which were later deemed irrelevant by investigators to the Clinton probe. Justice Department guidelines recommend against taking significant public actions shortly before an election that could sway the outcome.

From the Archives Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday defended his role in the firing of former FBI Director James Comey. Mr. Sessions cited the ""significance of the error"" Mr. Comey made in handling the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email use for his recommendation that Mr. Comey be fired.

Democrats say the true mistake was Mr. Comey’s decision in late October to tell Congress that the FBI was reopening its investigation into Mrs. Clinton due to the new emails, a move they blame in part for her election loss.

In the days after Mr. Comey’s disclosure, the FBI scrambled to get access to Mr. Weiner’s laptop so agents could search for the Clinton-related emails. Mr. Strzok, in texts over the next two days, referred to reviewing an affidavit. The FBI had to file an affidavit to get court approval in order to search for the Clinton-related emails, according to a search-warrant application that was unsealed in December 2016.

Mr. Strzok and a team of agents spent the following Saturday, extending into Sunday morning, reviewing about 3,000 emails from the Weiner laptop, according to the text messages.

“The three of us are going through the 3k (1000 each) to narrow down so the team can come back tomorrow early. and de-dupe,” Mr. Strzok wrote Ms. Page on Sunday, Nov. 6, a reference to culling duplicate emails the FBI had previously seen.

“Finishing up,” he wrote just after 1 a.m. Sunday. “Leaving finally now,” he added 30 minutes later, noting that the agents had found “no new classified” emails.

That same day, Nov. 6—two days before the election—Mr. Comey wrote another letter to Congress saying nothing in the new emails had changed the FBI’s previous conclusion that no prosecution was merited.

Newsletter Sign-up

Several months earlier, in July 2016, Mr. Comey had called a news conference to say he was recommending that no charges be brought against Mrs. Clinton for the way she handled classified material on her private email server.

Of 30,000 work-related emails turned over by Mrs. Clinton’s lawyers to the State Department, about 110 were determined to have varying levels of classified material on them, Mr. Comey said then. He called the handling of such information by Mrs. Clinton and her aides “extremely careless” but not subject to prosecution.

The timing of Mr. McCabe’s departure this week was a surprise, although he was expected to depart before long because he is qualified to retire with full benefits in March.

In an email to the bureau’s 35,000 employees on Monday, Mr. Way said: “It would be inappropriate for me to comment on specific aspects of the IG’s review right now.”",www.wsj.com,center,rqHhWiTkCldFnyE0

WASHINGTON – Russia special counsel Robert Mueller Friday rejected any notion that former Trump administration national security adviser Michael Flynn was tricked by FBI agents into lying about his communications with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak, resulting in his prosecution.

""The interview was voluntary, and lacked any indicia of coercion,"" Mueller's prosecutors asserted in new court documents, referring to the Jan. 24, 2017 interview at the White House just days after President Donald Trump's inauguration.

The new filings come after Flynn's attorneys suggested earlier this week that the FBI duped the former national security adviser by not warning him about the criminal consequences for lying to agents during the interview in which Flynn has now acknowledged falsely denying that his conversation with Kislyak included a discussion of Russia sanctions.

The new filings come in advance of Flynn's Dec. 18 sentencing. Prosecutors have recommended no prison time for the former Trump administration official who they said has provided substantial cooperation in the ongoing Russia investigation. Flynn's attorneys also have asked that he be spared prison time.

Before the interview, FBI officials had decided that they would not warn Flynn about the potential criminal jeopardy he faced for making false statements.

The interview, according to court documents, had been arranged by then-Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, who was subsequently fired for unauthorized disclosures to reporters. The primary interviewing agent was Peter Strzok, a senior counterintelligence official who was later dismissed for making disparaging comments about candidate Donald Trump in text messages exchanged with an FBI lawyer who was Strzok's girlfriend.

FBI agents did not follow Justice Department guidelines intended to protect journalists and their sources when they questioned Bryan Carmody during last year ’ s high-profile police raid of the freelance journalist ’ s San Francisco home , according to a recent Reporters Committee legal filing in a public records lawsuit against the Justice Department .
The FBI and the Justice Department ’ s Criminal Division also failed to adequately search for records related to the raid in response to Freedom of Information Act requests filed by the Reporters Committee . And the FBI unlawfully withheld the names of two agents who questioned Carmody .
Reporters Committee attorneys made the case that the authorities ’ inadequate searches violate the Freedom of Information Act in a recent motion in which the organization asked a federal court in Washington , D.C. , to reject the government ’ s request to quickly resolve a FOIA lawsuit in its favor . In the filing , they urged the district court to order the bureau to produce all responsive records related to the Carmody case .
The July 2 court filing marks the latest development in the Reporters Committee ’ s year-long fight to better understand the federal government ’ s involvement in the raid . Although San Francisco police obtained warrants to search Carmody ’ s property in May 2019 , the raid stunned American journalists and press freedom advocates . City police officers , accompanied by FBI agents , searched Carmody ’ s home and office , seized his equipment , and detained and questioned him for six hours as part of an investigation to learn the identity of a confidential source who leaked an internal police report to Carmody . A court later quashed all of the search warrants that gave rise to the searches , as each violated California ’ s shield law , and Carmody reached a $ 369,000 settlement with the City of San Francisco in March .
Meanwhile , the Reporters Committee has learned previously undisclosed details about the raid through public records from the San Francisco Police Department and federal agencies . For example , an FBI document obtained by the Reporters Committee last year through a FOIA lawsuit revealed that FBI agents knew Carmody was a journalist when they questioned him . More recently , a San Francisco Police Department memo obtained by the Reporters Committee showed that officers who conducted the raid on Carmody ’ s home were instructed not to use their body-worn cameras .
But the FBI ’ s latest admission — that the bureau did not follow internal Justice Department rules meant to protect journalists from unlawful searches and seizures — is especially alarming .
“ The government ’ s failure to abide by its own policy in connection with the FBI ’ s questioning of Carmody is deeply troubling , ” Reporters Committee attorneys state in their cross motion for summary judgment . “ Plaintiff and the public have a right to be fully informed as to how and why the federal government ’ s own rules for questioning journalists were not followed here . ”
The Justice Department codified its internal News Media Policy in 1973 , as public outrage grew in response to a tidal wave of federal subpoenas that asked journalists to turn over their confidential materials . The policy , which was most recently updated in 2014 and 2015 , prohibits federal officials from questioning reporters or seizing their work materials without following a certain set of procedures — including getting approval from the U.S. Attorney General , except in extreme circumstances .
But government filings in the Reporters Committee ’ s FOIA lawsuit demonstrate that federal law enforcement officials did not follow the guidelines before questioning Carmody . A declaration submitted to the court by a senior Justice Department FOIA official stated that all consultation and authorization requests made pursuant to the news media guidelines are tracked in a Justice Department database . In response to a Reporters Committee FOIA request , however , a search of the database using Bryan Carmody ’ s name “ produced no hits . ”
While it is clear that the Justice Department violated its own policy , records that have yet to be searched for could reveal whether federal employees considered the news media policy or other laws protecting journalists , such as the federal Privacy Protection Act and the California shield law , before questioning Carmody .
The Reporters Committee ’ s motion centers around the Justice Department ’ s inadequate searches in response to FOIA requests about the Carmody case . In response to the Reporters Committee ’ s request for “ email correspondence , text messages , and other electronic messages ” that referred to “ Carmody ” and other specified keywords , the FBI refused to conduct an actual search for emails and texts .
The agency also failed to search its own San Francisco field office or the records of the two San Francisco-based special agents who questioned Carmody .
These cursory searches , the Reporters Committee argues , fail to satisfy the agency ’ s obligations under FOIA and deprive the public of newsworthy information about a raid that undercut state and federal protections for Carmody and his sources .
In support of its motion , the Reporters Committee submitted proof that the FBI did not search for or locate records responsive to its request . Through a California Public Records Act request , the Reporters Committee obtained email correspondence between a San Francisco police officer , Lt. Pilar Torres , and Michael Eldridge , a FBI special agent .
In the email chain , Eldridge apologized to Torres for not being “ able to get a better result , ” likely referring to his attempted interrogation of Carmody , and thanked the officer for “ letting [ him ] take a shot . ”
The FBI should have also disclosed the email chain in response to the Reporters Committee ’ s federal public records request . However , authorities did not identify this email chain and perhaps other relevant correspondence , as the FBI refused to search through the text of emails and text messages themselves .
In the single document the FBI did disclose to the Reporters Committee , the agency redacted the names of the two special agents who questioned Carmody , citing FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7 ( c ) . Those exemptions apply to personal information , and require agencies and courts to balance privacy interests against the public ’ s interest in the material .
In this case , Reporters Committee attorneys argue , the privacy exemptions should not apply because the FBI special agents who questioned Carmody have no interest in secrecy to begin with . The name of one of the agents , Eldridge , is already public , the brief states , as the San Francisco police disclosed his identity in response to the Reporters Committee ’ s public records request under the California Public Records Act . Eldrige was publicly identified as an FBI special agent at least as far back as 2014 , when he submitted a high-profile search warrant affidavit in a domestic terrorism case .
Even if these FBI agents had any privacy interests , Reporters Committee attorneys argue , it is outweighed by the public ’ s interest in knowing the identity of who questioned a reporter in violation of the Justice Department ’ s News Media Policy .

Agents ignored Justice Department media guidelines

The Justice Department codified its internal News Media Policy in 1973, as public outrage grew in response to a tidal wave of federal subpoenas that asked journalists to turn over their confidential materials. The policy, which was most recently updated in 2014 and 2015, prohibits federal officials from questioning reporters or seizing their work materials without following a certain set of procedures — including getting approval from the U.S. Attorney General, except in extreme circumstances.

But government filings in the Reporters Committee’s FOIA lawsuit demonstrate that federal law enforcement officials did not follow the guidelines before questioning Carmody. A declaration submitted to the court by a senior Justice Department FOIA official stated that all consultation and authorization requests made pursuant to the news media guidelines are tracked in a Justice Department database. In response to a Reporters Committee FOIA request, however, a search of the database using Bryan Carmody’s name “produced no hits.”

While it is clear that the Justice Department violated its own policy, records that have yet to be searched for could reveal whether federal employees considered the news media policy or other laws protecting journalists, such as the federal Privacy Protection Act and the California shield law, before questioning Carmody.

A failure to search

The Reporters Committee’s motion centers around the Justice Department’s inadequate searches in response to FOIA requests about the Carmody case. In response to the Reporters Committee’s request for “email correspondence, text messages, and other electronic messages” that referred to “Carmody” and other specified keywords, the FBI refused to conduct an actual search for emails and texts.

The agency also failed to search its own San Francisco field office or the records of the two San Francisco-based special agents who questioned Carmody.

These cursory searches, the Reporters Committee argues, fail to satisfy the agency’s obligations under FOIA and deprive the public of newsworthy information about a raid that undercut state and federal protections for Carmody and his sources.

In support of its motion, the Reporters Committee submitted proof that the FBI did not search for or locate records responsive to its request. Through a California Public Records Act request, the Reporters Committee obtained email correspondence between a San Francisco police officer, Lt. Pilar Torres, and Michael Eldridge, a FBI special agent.

In the email chain, Eldridge apologized to Torres for not being “able to get a better result,” likely referring to his attempted interrogation of Carmody, and thanked the officer for “letting [him] take a shot.”

The FBI should have also disclosed the email chain in response to the Reporters Committee’s federal public records request. However, authorities did not identify this email chain and perhaps other relevant correspondence, as the FBI refused to search through the text of emails and text messages themselves.

Privacy vs. public interest

In the single document the FBI did disclose to the Reporters Committee, the agency redacted the names of the two special agents who questioned Carmody, citing FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(c). Those exemptions apply to personal information, and require agencies and courts to balance privacy interests against the public’s interest in the material.

In this case, Reporters Committee attorneys argue, the privacy exemptions should not apply because the FBI special agents who questioned Carmody have no interest in secrecy to begin with. The name of one of the agents, Eldridge, is already public, the brief states, as the San Francisco police disclosed his identity in response to the Reporters Committee’s public records request under the California Public Records Act. Eldrige was publicly identified as an FBI special agent at least as far back as 2014, when he submitted a high-profile search warrant affidavit in a domestic terrorism case.

Even if these FBI agents had any privacy interests, Reporters Committee attorneys argue, it is outweighed by the public’s interest in knowing the identity of who questioned a reporter in violation of the Justice Department’s News Media Policy.

“Even assuming … that there is any privacy interest in the names of these agents,” Reporters Committee attorneys wrote in the brief, “it is easily overcome by the strong public interest in knowing who was involved in the questioning of a journalist in violation of the DOJ’s News Media Policy.”

`` There is no such thing as a backdoor just for the good guys , and the American people do not have to choose between weakening encryption and effective investigations . ''
The Justice Department has previously called the attack an act of terrorism that was motivated by `` jihadist ideology .

WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump said Thursday he would have the FBI and the Justice Department review ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett's case, even as Chicago residents said the president should stay out of the racially charged incident.

The FBI has been investigating at least one matter in the Smollett case for weeks.

The agency began probing whether Smollett had any role in sending a threatening letter that was mailed to the actor at the Chicago studio where “Empire” is filmed a week before the alleged assault, a federal government official who has been briefed on the investigation told USA TODAY. FBI officials in Chicago declined to comment.

The letter, which was received on Jan. 22, contained a white substance that was later determined to be acetaminophen, or Tylenol.

Prosecutors in Chicago announced Tuesday they were dropping disorderly conduct charges against Smollett for filing a false police report. The decision came less than three weeks after the actor was indicted on charges that he paid two men to stage a hoax attack to make him look like the victim of a racist hate crime.

Smollett’s legal team objects to comments to the media made by Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office officials, saying prosecutors and police are ""continuing their campaign"" against the actor. Prosecutors said they’ve dropped the charges, but insist that doesn't mean Smollett was exonerated of wrongdoing.

News of the dropped charges outraged a variety of lawmakers, including Mayor Emanuel and Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson.

""This is a whitewash of justice,"" Emanuel declared. ""It’s Mr. Smollett who committed this hoax. He’s still saying he's innocent, still running down the Chicago Police Department. How dare he? How dare he?""

Police and prosecutors say Smollett paid two brothers, Abel and Ola Osundairo, $3,500 to stage an attack on Smollett near his apartment building in Chicago’s swanky Streeterville neighborhood, in which he was made to look like the victim of a vicious hate crime.

Police identified Smollett as a victim of an attack for weeks after the incident. The case shifted gears after the Osundairo brothers, who were on the cusp of being charged by police, told investigators that they worked with Smollett to carry out the attack.

In a terse news conference hours after news of the newly discovered emails , a somber Clinton said she was `` confident '' the information , whatever it is , wo n't change the conclusion the FBI director reached in July .
`` We are 11 days out from , perhaps , the most important national election of our lifetime , '' the Democratic nominee said . `` Voting is already underway in our country . So the American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately . ''
She added that Comey `` has said he does n't know whether the emails … are significant or not . So , let 's get it out . ''
`` I 'm confident , whatever they are , will not change the conclusion reached in July , '' she said , referring to Comey 's closure of the agency 's investigation — without recommendation prosecution — of her use of her private email server while she was secretary of state .
Taking only three questions from the media afterward , Clinton said she was blindsided by the FBI 's announcement it was reviewing the newly discovered emails .

The New York Times reported the astonishing news. “Counterintelligence investigators,” the paper writes, “had to consider whether the president’s own actions constituted a possible threat to national security.” U.S. presidents over the decades have made many foolhardy decisions that have undermined our security; never before have they been deemed a fit subject for an FBI investigation.

The proximate cause for the probe into Trump was his firing of FBI director James Comey, which the FBI considered both a potential crime and a national-security matter because it might shut down the investigation into Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election.

Even if they were shocked by the treatment of Comey, top FBI officials should have been able to quickly ascertain that the Russia investigation continued unimpeded — indeed, it is still ongoing today.

The director of the FBI has said that acts of espionage and theft by China's government pose the ""greatest long-term threat"" to the future of the US.

Speaking to the Hudson Institute in Washington, Christopher Wray described a multi-pronged disruption campaign.

He said China had begun targeting Chinese nationals living abroad, coercing their return, and was working to compromise US coronavirus research.

""The stakes could not be higher,"" Mr Wray said.

""China is engaged in a whole-of-state effort to become the world's only superpower by any means necessary,"" he added.

In a nearly hour-long speech on Tuesday, the FBI director outlined a stark picture of Chinese interference, a far-reaching campaign of economic espionage, data and monetary theft and illegal political activities, using bribery and blackmail to influence US policy.

""We've now reached a point where the FBI is now opening a new China-related counterintelligence case every 10 hours,"" Mr Wray said. ""Of the nearly 5,000 active counterintelligence cases currently under way across the country, almost half are related to China.""

The FBI director mentioned a programme called ""Fox Hunt"", which he said President Xi Jinping had ""spearheaded"" and he said was geared at Chinese nationals living abroad seen as threats to the Chinese government.

""We're talking about political rivals, dissidents, and critics seeking to expose China's extensive human rights violations,"" he said. ""The Chinese government wants to force them to return to China, and China's tactics to accomplish that are shocking.""

He continued: ""When it couldn't locate one Fox Hunt target, the Chinese government sent an emissary to visit the target's family here in the United States. The message they said to pass on? The target had two options: return to China promptly, or commit suicide.""

The programme was originally begun in 2015 to target people accused of corruption and has reportedly led to the capture of thousands of fugitives.

However, reports of extraordinary rendition of political opponents by Beijing have multiplied in recent years, starting with Gui Minhai, one of a group of Hong Kong booksellers who disappeared in 2015 and resurfaced in Chinese custody. Unlike the others, Mr Gui disappeared abroad - in Thailand - rather than from Hong Kong itself.

Globalisation extends Beijing's reach

China is fast becoming a new kind of threat to the West, not so much because of its growing military capabilities - though that is a factor - but because in economic and technical terms it is already a peer competitor of the United States, and a peer competitor in a very different kind of world.

Nineteenth Century great powers competed more or less on equal terms but operated in a far less integrated international system. In the second half of the 20th Century, the Soviet Union was a peer military competitor of the United States, but with a relatively weak economy largely isolated from the wider international system.

China, however, has huge and growing economic muscle. It shares much of the same economic space with the West and its dominance of crucial supply chains - think medical PPE for example - only enhances its power.

The level of integration of today's globalised world and the importance of data and information only act as force multipliers for Beijing's overt and covert global reach.

In the unusual address, Mr Wray asked Chinese-born people living in the US to contact the FBI if Chinese officials target them seeking their return.

The Chinese government has defended this programme in the past, saying it is part of a legitimate anti-corruption effort.

The threat posed by China will be further addressed by the US attorney general and secretary of state in coming weeks, Mr Wray said.

Mccarthy, John Mccormack, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Mairead Mcardle, Robert Verbruggen, Carrie Severino, Tobias Hoonhout, John Fund, Rich Lowry","If Director Comey had not conducted his July 5 press conference clearing Hillary Clinton , there would have been no cause to issue the October 28 letter to Congress .
Even absent Hillary Clinton ’ s latest bleat about how he cost her the election , FBI director James Comey ’ s testimony on Wednesday at a routine oversight hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee was certain to be anything but routine . And sure enough , Comey mounted a vigorous defense of his letter of October 28 , 2016 — eleven days before Election Day — in which he informed Congress that the Clinton e-mails investigation had been reopened .
Director Comey did nevertheless allow that he was made “ mildly nauseous ” by the suggestion that his letter affected the vote ’ s outcome .
Several features of the hearing were especially worth noting . I have dealt with one of them in a separate column — viz. , the director ’ s continuing defense of his assessment that there was insufficient criminal-intent evidence to warrant charging Mrs. Clinton . Now , let ’ s turn to another : the Democrats ’ effort to skew or erase entirely the context of Comey ’ s October 28 letter .
It would be foolish to deny that the letter may have had some impact on voters . The effect was likely very small : By the time of the letter ( as our Jim Geraghty has related ) , 35 million Americans had already voted ; most voters had already made up their minds about the e-mail scandal after many months of coverage and commentary ; Comey ’ s notification did not announce charges or accuse Clinton of additional wrongdoing ; and the ultimate determination that the new evidence did not change the FBI ’ s decision against bringing charges was also announced before Election Day . Still , to say President Trump ’ s margin of victory was “ razor thin ” is an understatement . So close was the contest that it is hard to discount anything as a factor possibly material to the outcome .
That said , Democrats would now have you believe that history began on October 28 . In reality , the critical context of that day ’ s letter to Congress was the Comey press conference four months earlier — on July 5 — followed by the director ’ s extensive congressional testimony in the days that followed . It makes no sense for Democrats to complain about the letter and its departure from protocol but ignore the press conference ’ s far more extensive departures . To the ( debatable ) extent that there was a need to notify Congress in late October that the investigation had been reopened , it was precisely because the director , in early July , had made a highly unusual , highly public pronouncement that the investigation was complete and the case too weak to charge .
You may recall the unrestrained Democratic glee over that particular breach of protocol .
Of course , smarter Democrats perceive this incongruity . Thus , rather than ignore the Comey press conference , they bowdlerize it , choosing to remember only the first three-quarters of Comey ’ s bravura performance . That , you ’ ll recall , is the part in which the director rebuked Clinton for her inappropriate conduct , her “ extreme carelessness ” in handling highly classified information , the cavalier culture that prevailed during Clinton ’ s State Department tenure regarding the need to safeguard intelligence , and so on .
What Democrats choose to forget , and hope you will too , is the closing section of Comey ’ s remarks . That was when he seized the power of the Justice Department to render legal conclusions about both the prosecutorial merits of the case and the interpretation of the relevant criminal statute . In this conclusion , not only did Comey claim that Clinton ’ s conduct did not warrant an indictment , he gratuitously added the declaration that no “ reasonable prosecutor ” could disagree with his assessment .
This was a specious claim , but it commanded a respectful hearing , having come from an official who was not just the nation ’ s top investigator but had been a highly accomplished , top-ranking prosecutor in his own right . And remember ( even if Dems prefer that you forget ) , Comey ’ s “ lack of criminal intent ” theory swept aside not only the classified-information felonies but also Clinton ’ s willful destruction of tens of thousands of government records — more felonies . By the time the press conference ended — poof ! — it was as if someone had taken BleachBit to the thought of filing such charges .
Now that Clinton has lost and Democrats need a scapegoat , they have suddenly developed amnesia over this decisive aspect of the Comey press conference . But it saved Clinton ’ s candidacy . Now that we know what a lousy campaign she ran from July to November , Democrats understandably don ’ t regard this as any great favor . Back in July , however , when they were so sure that only Comey — and certainly not Donald Trump — could derail the next Clinton administration , Democrats could not have been more effusive in proclaiming the director ’ s unwavering integrity and legal acumen .
Now that Clinton has lost and Democrats need a scapegoat .
In fact , back then , while Clinton campaign staffers were a bit miffed over Comey ’ s censorious description of Clinton ’ s misconduct , smart Democrats understood that it was this stern critique that imbued Comey ’ s ultimate rejection of criminal charges with such credibility . Democrats knew they badly needed that credibility : Attorney General Loretta Lynch had just sullied herself with the Bill Clinton tarmac tête à tête . Comey ’ s projection of confident , fair-minded authority was essential if Democrats were to convince voters that Clinton had been exonerated — and on the matter of exoneration , they calculated that it didn ’ t matter how recklessly irresponsible Clinton ’ s actions were as long as they could hang their hat on the FBI director ’ s conclusion of no criminality .
Just as Democrats used to love the specter of Russian meddling in U.S. political processes when the objective was to undermine Ronald Reagan or give Barack Obama more “ flexibility , ” they were equally enamored of FBI intrusion into the election as long as the director ’ s irregular commentary was helping them . They got fastidious about law-enforcement secrecy protocols only when the commentary cut against them in October — and they didn ’ t decide that the commentary was consequential until they lost .
At Wednesday ’ s hearing , Director Comey defended his October 28 letter by opining that to have failed to inform Congress would have been an “ act of concealment , ” which in his view would have been “ catastrophic. ” This is more melodramatic than persuasive .
Almost all criminal investigations are concealed from Congress and the public — indeed , grand jury proceedings are concealed by statute . Far from being outrageous , withholding information from Congress ( and , for that matter , from the political components of the executive branch ) is the norm in law-enforcement . That is why officials refuse to confirm or deny the existence of an investigation . It ’ s why they never describe the evidence collected in an investigation unless and until they are prepared to put their money where their mouth is by filing charges . They know that due process consists of formal judicial proceedings in which the accused has a fair opportunity to defend herself — not trying people in the court of public opinion by public revelations of uncharged investigative information .
Reasonable minds can differ about whether , under the circumstances that Director Comey himself created , the October 28 letter was appropriate . On one hand , having informed Congress that the investigation was closed and that he would keep lawmakers apprised of any important new developments , Comey persuasively contends that the letter was necessary to honor that commitment . On the other hand , there is an equally strong case that he could have held off on the notification while the FBI plowed through the late-discovered information that triggered it — namely , newly recovered e-mails on a device seized in the separate investigation of disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner ( whose wife , Huma Abedin , was Clinton ’ s closest aide ) .
As we now know , that review was also concluded before Election Day . Thus , had Comey waited a few more days to alert Congress while his agents studied the new e-mails , he would have been in a position to know their importance or lack thereof . With that information , Comey might have prudently decided there was no need to say anything prior to the election . And even if he had decided to speak , Clinton would not have been hurt by a letter saying the FBI had reviewed newly discovered evidence but remained convinced that Clinton should not be charged .
First , if Comey had not conducted the unnecessary July 5 press conference , there would have been no cause to issue the October 28 letter .
Second , it is not possible to square the press conference and the claim that politics did not influence the FBI ’ s decision-making . Ordinarily , the FBI does not confirm or deny the existence of an investigation and does not publicize the evidence uncovered in investigations that do not result in charges . In this instance , Comey decided not to follow those strictures . Why ? As he put it during the press conference , he was making his “ unusual statement ” because “ the American people deserve those details in a case of intense public interest. ” Put aside that a lot of investigations are of intense public interest and yet the usual no-comment rules are followed . What made this investigation of intense public interest was politics , pure and simple .
It is not possible to square the press conference and the claim that politics did not influence the FBI ’ s decision-making .
Third , had the protocols been followed , the FBI and Justice Department would have made no statements about the investigation , including no statement that it had been closed . Mrs. Clinton had no right to a clean bill of health from the FBI . She should have had to content herself with being able to note that she had not been charged with a crime and to urge that this meant she was not guilty of one . But she had no right to have voters advised , before going to the polls , that there was no active investigation into her misconduct .
Fourth , there is an important reason why the FBI does not make a formal announcement when an investigation is closed without charges : It frequently happens that new information surfaces , justifying the reopening of the file . The real problem in Clinton ’ s case is not that the public was told that the investigation was reopened ; it is that the public should never have been told that it was closed in the first place .
Fifth and finally , what cost Clinton the election is her unfitness for public office . The e-mails investigation bears on that flaw in that it demonstrates her lack of character , her outsized sense of entitlement , her habitual flouting of rules , her thoroughgoing deceitfulness , and her inability to explain her behavior ( indeed , to explain her explanations ) in a way that does not insult the intelligence . Whether , in addition to all that , her conduct was also illegal is an interesting academic question , but it is superfluous when it comes to the only question that matters : Should the Democrats have made such a person their presidential nominee .
That being the case , if Mrs. Clinton really wants to know why she lost , she will not find the answer in any letter Jim Comey has ever written . She needs to look within .","(Reuters photo: Joshua Roberts)

And sure enough, Comey mounted a vigorous defense of his letter of October 28, 2016 — eleven days before Election Day — in which he informed Congress that the Clinton e-mails investigation had been reopened.

Director Comey did nevertheless allow that he was made “mildly nauseous” by the suggestion that his letter affected the vote’s outcome.

Several features of the hearing were especially worth noting. I have dealt with one of them in a separate column — viz., the director’s continuing defense of his assessment that there was insufficient criminal-intent evidence to warrant charging Mrs. Clinton. Now, let’s turn to another: the Democrats’ effort to skew or erase entirely the context of Comey’s October 28 letter.

It would be foolish to deny that the letter may have had some impact on voters. The effect was likely very small: By the time of the letter (as our Jim Geraghty has related), 35 million Americans had already voted; most voters had already made up their minds about the e-mail scandal after many months of coverage and commentary; Comey’s notification did not announce charges or accuse Clinton of additional wrongdoing; and the ultimate determination that the new evidence did not change the FBI’s decision against bringing charges was also announced before Election Day. Still, to say President Trump’s margin of victory was “razor thin” is an understatement. So close was the contest that it is hard to discount anything as a factor possibly material to the outcome.

That said, Democrats would now have you believe that history began on October 28. In reality, the critical context of that day’s letter to Congress was the Comey press conference four months earlier — on July 5 — followed by the director’s extensive congressional testimony in the days that followed. It makes no sense for Democrats to complain about the letter and its departure from protocol but ignore the press conference’s far more extensive departures. To the (debatable) extent that there was a need to notify Congress in late October that the investigation had been reopened, it was precisely because the director, in early July, had made a highly unusual, highly public pronouncement that the investigation was complete and the case too weak to charge.

You may recall the unrestrained Democratic glee over that particular breach of protocol.

Of course, smarter Democrats perceive this incongruity. Thus, rather than ignore the Comey press conference, they bowdlerize it, choosing to remember only the first three-quarters of Comey’s bravura performance. That, you’ll recall, is the part in which the director rebuked Clinton for her inappropriate conduct, her “extreme carelessness” in handling highly classified information, the cavalier culture that prevailed during Clinton’s State Department tenure regarding the need to safeguard intelligence, and so on.

What Democrats choose to forget, and hope you will too, is the closing section of Comey’s remarks. That was when he seized the power of the Justice Department to render legal conclusions about both the prosecutorial merits of the case and the interpretation of the relevant criminal statute. In this conclusion, not only did Comey claim that Clinton’s conduct did not warrant an indictment, he gratuitously added the declaration that no “reasonable prosecutor” could disagree with his assessment.

This was a specious claim, but it commanded a respectful hearing, having come from an official who was not just the nation’s top investigator but had been a highly accomplished, top-ranking prosecutor in his own right. And remember (even if Dems prefer that you forget), Comey’s “lack of criminal intent” theory swept aside not only the classified-information felonies but also Clinton’s willful destruction of tens of thousands of government records — more felonies. By the time the press conference ended — poof! — it was as if someone had taken BleachBit to the thought of filing such charges.

Now that Clinton has lost and Democrats need a scapegoat, they have suddenly developed amnesia over this decisive aspect of the Comey press conference. But it saved Clinton’s candidacy. Now that we know what a lousy campaign she ran from July to November, Democrats understandably don’t regard this as any great favor. Back in July, however, when they were so sure that only Comey — and certainly not Donald Trump — could derail the next Clinton administration, Democrats could not have been more effusive in proclaiming the director’s unwavering integrity and legal acumen.

Now that Clinton has lost and Democrats need a scapegoat.

In fact, back then, while Clinton campaign staffers were a bit miffed over Comey’s censorious description of Clinton’s misconduct, smart Democrats understood that it was this stern critique that imbued Comey’s ultimate rejection of criminal charges with such credibility. Democrats knew they badly needed that credibility: Attorney General Loretta Lynch had just sullied herself with the Bill Clinton tarmac tête à tête. Comey’s projection of confident, fair-minded authority was essential if Democrats were to convince voters that Clinton had been exonerated — and on the matter of exoneration, they calculated that it didn’t matter how recklessly irresponsible Clinton’s actions were as long as they could hang their hat on the FBI director’s conclusion of no criminality.

Just as Democrats used to love the specter of Russian meddling in U.S. political processes when the objective was to undermine Ronald Reagan or give Barack Obama more “flexibility,” they were equally enamored of FBI intrusion into the election as long as the director’s irregular commentary was helping them. They got fastidious about law-enforcement secrecy protocols only when the commentary cut against them in October — and they didn’t decide that the commentary was consequential until they lost.

At Wednesday’s hearing, Director Comey defended his October 28 letter by opining that to have failed to inform Congress would have been an “act of concealment,” which in his view would have been “catastrophic.” This is more melodramatic than persuasive.

Almost all criminal investigations are concealed from Congress and the public — indeed, grand jury proceedings are concealed by statute. Far from being outrageous, withholding information from Congress (and, for that matter, from the political components of the executive branch) is the norm in law-enforcement. That is why officials refuse to confirm or deny the existence of an investigation. It’s why they never describe the evidence collected in an investigation unless and until they are prepared to put their money where their mouth is by filing charges. They know that due process consists of formal judicial proceedings in which the accused has a fair opportunity to defend herself — not trying people in the court of public opinion by public revelations of uncharged investigative information.

Reasonable minds can differ about whether, under the circumstances that Director Comey himself created, the October 28 letter was appropriate. On one hand, having informed Congress that the investigation was closed and that he would keep lawmakers apprised of any important new developments, Comey persuasively contends that the letter was necessary to honor that commitment. On the other hand, there is an equally strong case that he could have held off on the notification while the FBI plowed through the late-discovered information that triggered it — namely, newly recovered e-mails on a device seized in the separate investigation of disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner (whose wife, Huma Abedin, was Clinton’s closest aide).

As we now know, that review was also concluded before Election Day. Thus, had Comey waited a few more days to alert Congress while his agents studied the new e-mails, he would have been in a position to know their importance or lack thereof. With that information, Comey might have prudently decided there was no need to say anything prior to the election. And even if he had decided to speak, Clinton would not have been hurt by a letter saying the FBI had reviewed newly discovered evidence but remained convinced that Clinton should not be charged.

In any event, let’s be clear on five things.

First, if Comey had not conducted the unnecessary July 5 press conference, there would have been no cause to issue the October 28 letter.

Second, it is not possible to square the press conference and the claim that politics did not influence the FBI’s decision-making. Ordinarily, the FBI does not confirm or deny the existence of an investigation and does not publicize the evidence uncovered in investigations that do not result in charges. In this instance, Comey decided not to follow those strictures. Why? As he put it during the press conference, he was making his “unusual statement” because “the American people deserve those details in a case of intense public interest.” Put aside that a lot of investigations are of intense public interest and yet the usual no-comment rules are followed. What made this investigation of intense public interest was politics, pure and simple.

It is not possible to square the press conference and the claim that politics did not influence the FBI’s decision-making.

Third, had the protocols been followed, the FBI and Justice Department would have made no statements about the investigation, including no statement that it had been closed. Mrs. Clinton had no right to a clean bill of health from the FBI. She should have had to content herself with being able to note that she had not been charged with a crime and to urge that this meant she was not guilty of one. But she had no right to have voters advised, before going to the polls, that there was no active investigation into her misconduct.

Advertisement

Fourth, there is an important reason why the FBI does not make a formal announcement when an investigation is closed without charges: It frequently happens that new information surfaces, justifying the reopening of the file. The real problem in Clinton’s case is not that the public was told that the investigation was reopened; it is that the public should never have been told that it was closed in the first place.

Fifth and finally, what cost Clinton the election is her unfitness for public office. The e-mails investigation bears on that flaw in that it demonstrates her lack of character, her outsized sense of entitlement, her habitual flouting of rules, her thoroughgoing deceitfulness, and her inability to explain her behavior (indeed, to explain her explanations) in a way that does not insult the intelligence. Whether, in addition to all that, her conduct was also illegal is an interesting academic question, but it is superfluous when it comes to the only question that matters: Should the Democrats have made such a person their presidential nominee.

That being the case, if Mrs. Clinton really wants to know why she lost, she will not find the answer in any letter Jim Comey has ever written. She needs to look within.

Opinion columnist

In a bombshell report yesterday, the Justice Department Inspector General found that the Federal Bureau of Investigation made “fundamental errors” and persistently deceived a secret court to authorize surveilling a 2016 Trump presidential campaign official. Inspector General Michael Horowitz did not find that the FBI’s actions were spurred by political bias but that conclusion is not necessarily shared by Attorney General William Barr. Unfortunately, this is only the latest episode of decades of FBI misconduct before America’s most powerful secret court.

Perhaps the most jolting revelations in the IG report detail the FBI’s efforts to secure a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) search warrant to use against the Trump campaign after suspicions were raised of Russian collusion. A FISA warrant is the nuclear bomb of searches, authorizing the FBI “to conduct, simultaneous telephone, microphone, cell phone, e-mail and computer surveillance of the U.S. person target’s home, workplace and vehicles,” as well as “physical searches of the target’s residence, office, vehicles, computer, safe deposit box and U.S. mails,” as a FISA court decision noted. The FISA court is extremely deferential, approving 99% of all search warrant requests.

A litany of missteps by the FBI

The IG report concluded FBI officials made 17 “significant inaccuracies and omissions” in its submissions to the FISA court to secure warrants to target former Trump advisor Carter Page: “FBI personnel fell far short of the requirement in FBI policy that they ensure that all factual statements in a FISA application are ‘scrupulously accurate.’ We identified multiple instances in which factual assertions relied upon in the first FISA application were inaccurate, incomplete, or unsupported by appropriate documentation, based upon information the FBI had in its possession at the time the application was filed.”

The FBI refrained from launching a FISA warrant request until it came into possession of a dossier from Christopher Steele, a former British intelligent agent. The Steele dossier played ""a central and essential role in the decision by FBI [Office of General Counsel] to support the request for FISA surveillance targeting Carter Page, as well as the FBI's ultimate decision to seek the FISA order,"" the IG report concluded. The FBI ""drew almost entirely"" from the Steele dossier to prove a “well-developed conspiracy” between Russians and the Trump campaign. The IG found that FBI agents were “unable to corroborate any of the specific substantive allegations against Carter Page” in the Steele dossier but the FBI relied on Steele’s allegations regardless.

The FBI withheld from the FISA court key details that would have undercut the dossier’s credibility, including a warning from a top Justice Department official that “Steele may have been hired by someone associated with presidential candidate Clinton or the DNC [Democratic National Committee].” The FBI also deceived the FISA court by wrongly claiming that Steele’s prior informant work had been “used in criminal proceedings” by the Justice Department. The CIA disdained the Steele dossier as “an internet rumor,” one FBI official told IG investigators. The IG report obliterated the credibility of the Steele dossier.

Instances of the FBI's abuse of power

Yesterday’s IG report was only the latest in a long series of revelations about FBI misconduct at the FISA court:

*In 2002, the FISA court revealed that FBI agents had false or misleading claims in 75 cases and a top FBI counterterrorism official was prohibited from ever appearing before the court again.

The report chronicles a tense standoff during which FBI agent Peter Strzok steered the Justice Department ’ s Office of Intelligence ( OI ) to finally sign off on a historic spy warrant on Trump campaign adviser Carter Page . A senior Justice attorney had wanted to know more about the political biases of Mr. Steele , a former British intelligence officer who later would be shown to be a Clinton campaign-paid researcher .
In one instance , Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz ’ s report disputed Mr. Strzok ’ s version of events on what he had shared with OI staff writing the spy warrant .
Mr. Strzok showed hostility toward candidate Donald Trump in private messages to his lover , FBI counsel Lisa Page . He talked of stopping Mr. Trump and of having an “ insurance policy . ”
The FBI ’ s sworn affidavit under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) eventually was submitted and approved on Oct. 21 , 2016 , omitting any reference to Mr. Steele ’ s possible Democratic Party/Clinton ties .
Today , Mr. Steele ’ s dossier has been proven to be all wrong when it comes to his dozen or so Trump-Russia conspiracy allegations , including the parts on Mr . Page . Special counsel Robert Mueller said he did not find a conspiracy and exonerated Mr . Page .
In 2016 , the FBI knew Mr. Steele was paid by Fusion GPS through a law firm . The IG report depicts Mr. Strzok ’ s Hurricane Crossfire agents , as the FBI ’ s Russia probe was code-named , as not particularly aggressive in identifying the firm , Perkins Coie . The law firm represented the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee , and funneled the money to Fusion to pay Mr. Steele about $ 160,000 .
If the FBI had identified Perkins Coie , then presumedly its sworn FISA affidavit would have informed the FISA court that Mr. Steele ’ s allegations were partisan opposition research for the Clinton campaign to attack candidate Trump .
The FBI ’ s Crossfire agents began receiving Mr. Steele ’ s memos in mid-September , just in time to provide the pivotal evidence to win the federal court ’ s approval of a wiretap . Mr. Steele had begun providing the dossier memos to the FBI in July . In early October , agents meet with him in Rome to try to sign him up for $ 50,000 to keep investigating Mr. Trump .
Mr. Steele ’ s allegations were many , but the two basic ones used in the affidavit were that Mr . Page met secretly in July with two Kremlin figures and that there was an extensive conspiracy between Mr. Trump and Moscow to interfere in the election .
The FBI knew during the FISA drafting that Russia had hacked Democratic Party computers . WikiLeaks had released thousands of stolen emails in July .
Stuart Evans , a deputy assistant attorney general , oversaw the Justice Department ’ s Office of Intelligence ( OI ) that drafted and approved the Page warrant . He emerged in the Horowitz report as a lone voice of skepticism over Mr. Steele ’ s somewhat mysterious sourcing .
Mr. Evans began raising red flags on Oct. 11 , 2016 . He later told the IG that he was surprised to learn from the FBI for the first time that “ Steele had been paid to develop opposition research . ”
Friction quickly arose between the OI staff and Mr. Strzok .
“ [ Mr. Evans ] told us that he recalled that he , the OI Unit Chief , and the OI Attorney were all quite surprised by this new information and that it was frustrating that they had not been informed sooner , ” the IG report said . “ Evans said that the new information , coupled with the sensitive nature of the case , made him concerned that the source might have a bias that needed to be disclosed to the court . ”
That day Mr. Strzok and Mr. Evans spoke by phone .
Later , Mr. Strzok messaged Ms . Page : “ Currently fighting with Stu [ Evans ] for this FISA . ”
He urged her to persuade her boss , then-Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe , to intervene .
An hour later , Mr. Strzok , who later would be fired for his partisan messages to Ms . Page , emailed a unit chief in the FBI Office of General Counsel . He brought up Mrs. Clinton ’ s name .
“ Stu is very nervous , ” Mr. Strzok said . “ He said he wasn ’ t aware of the fact until a few hours ago that [ Mr. Steele ] was employed to find this information by a named client , in turn hired by an unnamed client presumably affiliated with the Clinton campaign in some manner . ”
Mr. Strzok confided to the FBI attorney that Mr. Evans might sabotage the FISA paperwork . “ I ’ m worried about what Stu whispers in court adviser ’ s ear , ” he said .
He asserted to the FBI lawyer that he “ absolutely informed ” Mr. Evans ‘ office about Mr. Steele ’ s connections .
On this issue , Mr. Horowitz , the inspector general , sided with Mr. Evans and against Mr. Strzok . Mr. Horowitz said he could find no evidence that the Strzok team ever advised Mr. Evans until he made inquiries on Oct. 11 .
The IG report said : “ The OIG did not find any written communications indicating that anyone on the Crossfire Hurricane team advised OI about the potential or suspected political connections to Steele ’ s reporting before Evans raised his questions on October 11 , and nothing to that effect appeared in the October 11 draft FISA application . Further , the emails described above containing Evans ’ s questions about Steele ’ s campaign affiliation or contributions suggest that OI did not have prior knowledge . ”
The next day , Oct. 12 , the Office of Intelligence staff sent more questions to the Crossfire agents and brought up the issue of Mr. Steele ’ s possible ties to Mrs. Clinton .
The OI team asked if the FBI could “ articulate why it deems [ Mr. Steele ‘ s ] reporting to be credible notwithstanding [ Mr. Steele ] did the investigation based on [ a ] private citizen ’ s motivation to help [ Hillary Clinton/Democratic Party ] , ” the IG report said .
The FBI team respond that “ Steele was not a U.S. citizen and therefore had no vested interest in the outcome of the election . ”
An OI attorney told the IG that answer raised even more questions .
It was sometime during Oct. 11-12 that the FBI provided a new detail : that Mr. Steele was hired by the investigative firm Fusion GPS and its co-founder , Glenn Simpson .
Mr. Steele said he had learned in July — well before the FISA warrant — that Fusion was working for Perkins Coie and that he told the FBI .
FBI witnesses told Mr. Horowitz that Mr. Steele didn ’ t want to be asked about the law firm ’ s identity . The IG said he found no evidence that was true .
Later , on Oct. 12 , then-FBI Director James B. Comey and Mr. McCabe , the deputy director , met with Mr. Strzok and top counterintelligence agent Bill Priestap . At that meeting , Mr. Comey was briefed on the Justice Department ’ s concerns that Mr. Steele may be a Clinton operative , meaning his evidence had a partisan motive .
Mr. Comey was “ ‘ supportive ’ of moving forward despite this concerns , ” the IG said , based on participants ’ notes .
Afterward , Ms . Page joined Mr. Strzok in urging approval of the FISA warrant .
She messaged Mr. McCabe : “ OI now has a robust explanation re any possible bias of the chs [ confidential human source ] in the package . Don ’ t know what the holdup is now , other than Stu ’ s continued concerns . Strong operational need to have in place before Monday if at all possible , which means ct tomorrow . ”
By Oct. 21 a compromise was reached . The OI and the FBI agreed that they would address Mr. Steele ’ s motives in an affidavit footnote . It said : “ The FBI speculates that [ Fusion ’ s Mr. Simpson ] was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit [ Mr. Trump ‘ s ] campaign . ”
Mr. Strzok and Ms . Page were quite talkative leading up to Oct. 21 . Mr. Strzok had put the Hillary Clinton email probe behind him .
On the day he and Mr. Priestap opened Crossfire Hurricane on July 31 , he messaged : “ And damn this feels momentous . Because this matters . The other one did too , but that was to ensure we didn ’ t F something up . This matters because this MATTERS . ”
On Aug. 8 , as Mr. Trump squared off against Mrs. Clinton , Ms . Page texted : “ [ Mr. Trump ‘ s ] not ever going to become president , right ? Right . ”
Mr. Strzok responded : “ No . No . he won ’ t . We ’ ll stop it . ”
Mr. Horowitz wrote this in a 2018 report about those texts : “ It is not only indicative of a biased state of mind but , even more seriously , implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate ’ s electoral prospects . This is antithetical to the core values of the FBI and the Department of Justice . ”
Two months later , Mr. Strzok won the battle to spy on Carter Page .
Mr. Horowitz cleared Mr. Strzok of being motivated by bias in his recent report .
Looking back on the internal debate , Mr. Evans told the IG that he objected to the FISA spying not only based on Mr. Steele ’ s skimpy background but also on the blunt political implications of such a wiretap .
The inspector general cast the Evans position this way : “ According to Evans , he raised on multiple occasions with the FBI , including with Strzok , Lisa Page , and later McCabe , whether seeking FISA authority targeting Carter Page was a good idea , even if the legal standard was met . He explained that he did not see a compelling ‘ upside ’ to the FISA because Carter Page knew he was under FBI investigation ( according to news reports ) and was therefore not likely to say anything incriminating over the telephone or in email . On the other hand , Evans saw significant ‘ downside ’ because the target of the FISA was politically sensitive and the Department would be criticized later if this FISA was ever disclosed publicly . ”
Mr. Evans ‘ fears materialized in 2018 . Rep. Devin Nunes , California Republican and then-chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , forced the FBI to release heavily redacted FISA warrants on Mr . Page — the same ones debated by Mr. Evans and Mr. Strzok .
They showed for the first time that the FBI did in fact rely on a Democratic Party-financed dossier to persuade judges to sign four warrants covering October 2016 to September 2017 .
Mr. Horowitz said the dossier was “ central and essential ” to the FBI asking for FISA authority .
The IG blasted the FBI , saying it omitted exculpatory evidence or submitted false information 17 times for affidavits for which an FBI agent had sworn followed federal law .
The most glaring slight , he said , was that Mr. Steele ’ s main source in Moscow told the FBI in January 2017 that the information he provided was rumor and gossip . He said he never suspected that Mr. Steele would put it in a report sent to Washington to damage Mr. Trump and his people . The FBI judged him as truthful .
The source ’ s discrediting of the Steele reporting was not added by the FBI to three subsequent FISA applications .
Mr. Steele ’ s June-to-December 2016 dossier memos contain sensational allegations , such as Mr. Trump funded and oversaw the computer hacking ; his lawyer , Michael Cohen , traveled to Prague to execute a cover-up ; Mr . Page and campaign manager Paul Manafort worked as a team to coordinate with the Kremlin ; and this was all part of an extensive Trump campaign/Russia conspiracy .
None of those allegations proved true . Mr. Mueller said he did not establish such a conspiracy , the FBI concluded that Cohen didn ’ t go to Prague , and Mr . Page and Manafort never met or spoke .","The Hillary Clinton presidential campaign and its possible links to Christopher Steele were discussed inside the FBI’s top echelons before it obtained court authority to wiretap a Trump associate based largely on Mr. Steele’s Democratic Party opposition research, according to the Justice Department’s inspector general report.

The report chronicles a tense standoff during which FBI agent Peter Strzok steered the Justice Department’s Office of Intelligence (OI) to finally sign off on a historic spy warrant on Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. A senior Justice attorney had wanted to know more about the political biases of Mr. Steele, a former British intelligence officer who later would be shown to be a Clinton campaign-paid researcher.

In one instance, Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz’s report disputed Mr. Strzok’s version of events on what he had shared with OI staff writing the spy warrant.

Mr. Strzok showed hostility toward candidate Donald Trump in private messages to his lover, FBI counsel Lisa Page. He talked of stopping Mr. Trump and of having an “insurance policy.”

The FBI’s sworn affidavit under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) eventually was submitted and approved on Oct. 21, 2016, omitting any reference to Mr. Steele’s possible Democratic Party/Clinton ties.

Today, Mr. Steele’s dossier has been proven to be all wrong when it comes to his dozen or so Trump-Russia conspiracy allegations, including the parts on Mr. Page. Special counsel Robert Mueller said he did not find a conspiracy and exonerated Mr. Page.

In 2016, the FBI knew Mr. Steele was paid by Fusion GPS through a law firm. The IG report depicts Mr. Strzok’s Hurricane Crossfire agents, as the FBI’s Russia probe was code-named, as not particularly aggressive in identifying the firm, Perkins Coie. The law firm represented the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, and funneled the money to Fusion to pay Mr. Steele about $160,000.

If the FBI had identified Perkins Coie, then presumedly its sworn FISA affidavit would have informed the FISA court that Mr. Steele’s allegations were partisan opposition research for the Clinton campaign to attack candidate Trump.

The FBI’s Crossfire agents began receiving Mr. Steele’s memos in mid-September, just in time to provide the pivotal evidence to win the federal court’s approval of a wiretap. Mr. Steele had begun providing the dossier memos to the FBI in July. In early October, agents meet with him in Rome to try to sign him up for $50,000 to keep investigating Mr. Trump.

Mr. Steele’s allegations were many, but the two basic ones used in the affidavit were that Mr. Page met secretly in July with two Kremlin figures and that there was an extensive conspiracy between Mr. Trump and Moscow to interfere in the election.

The internal FISA debate begins

Stuart Evans, a deputy assistant attorney general, oversaw the Justice Department’s Office of Intelligence (OI) that drafted and approved the Page warrant. He emerged in the Horowitz report as a lone voice of skepticism over Mr. Steele’s somewhat mysterious sourcing.

The Murphy campaign noted that a conservative super PAC earlier this year filed a complaint on the issue that the FBI is looking into.

“This complaint was written by a Republican super PAC willing to say anything to elect Marco Rubio Marco Antonio RubioGOP senators plan to tune out impeachment week Republicans warn election results are 'wake-up call' for Trump Paul's demand to out whistleblower rankles GOP colleagues MORE,” said Murphy campaign spokesman Joshua Karp. “Neither Patrick nor any current or past employees have ever been contacted regarding this matter, and we are confident an examination of the facts will result in its dismissal.”

Murphy, 33, is running against Rubio, the incumbent Republican, in a race that could help decide which party controls the Senate in 2017. Rubio currently leads Murphy by an average of 5.6 percentage points, according to RealClearPolitics.

The FBI investigation, however, relates to Murphy’s first run for the House in the 2012 campaign cycle.

The allegation — originally submitted by a Republican super PAC run by a former top aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellMcConnell protege emerges as Kentucky's next rising star Hillicon Valley: Schumer questions Army over use of TikTok | Federal court rules against random searches of travelers' phones | Groups push for election security funds in stopgap bill | Facebook's new payment feature | Disney+ launch hit by glitches McConnell, GOP leaders say they won't be watching House impeachment hearing MORE (R-Ky.) — is that Murphy’s high school friend and major political donor, Ibrahim Al-Rashid, coordinated a “straw donor” scheme to boost Murphy.

Al-Rashid didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment. And Murphy’s campaign declined to say whether Murphy’s attorneys had discussed the FBI investigation with Al-Rashid’s attorney.

A straw donor scheme occurs when a wealthy donor skirts legal limits on political donations by funneling money into campaigns using other people’s names.

For any charges to be backed in the Al-Rashid investigation, the FBI must prove that the person or people running the scheme reimbursed donors without their permission. It would also be illegal to agree to be the named donors using somebody else’s money.

The GOP super PAC, the Senate Leadership Fund, claimed in its June complaint to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) that 11 donors in Texas, Pennsylvania and Florida “participated in an unlawful scheme to funnel Ibrahim Al-Rashid’s contributions, or were used by Al-Rashid to funnel contributions without their knowledge.” A total of $24,050 was involved.

Al-Rashid is the son of a powerful and politically connected Saudi billionaire. He’s been a major financial benefactor of Murphy’s, giving almost $400,000 to his campaigns and to outside groups supporting the Florida congressman.

To support its allegation, the Republican group argued that “inconsistent and changing employer and occupation information listed for some of these contributors suggests that some may not have been aware that they made the reported contributions.”

The Senate Leadership Fund, which is spending tens of millions to help GOP Senate candidates including Rubio, has sought to directly implicate Murphy in the alleged scheme.

“At the time the contributions ... were made to Patrick Murphy’s campaign, Murphy served as his own campaign treasurer and signed the FEC reports on which these contributions are listed,” the group stated in its FEC complaint.

“Treasurers are responsible for the reports they file,” added the group, claiming that Murphy ought to have been aware, for example, “that his friend’s housekeeper in Miami” wasn’t a senior executive at the Texas-based company.

In an unrelated development on Monday, Murphy and other Democratic Senate candidates returned thousands of dollars they received from another alleged illegal donation scheme.

After reading an investigative report about Boston’s Thornton Law Firm, published Saturday by the Boston Globe Spotlight team and the Center for Responsive Politics, Murphy decided to return the $21,800 he received from a Thornton fundraiser in January.

“The Globe’s investigation has revealed troubling details about these donations,” Karp told The Hill on Monday. “We’ll be donating it to the U.S. Treasury, because that is the right thing to do.”

The former FBI Director evades and dodges in an interview with Chris Wallace.

Twenty years ago, Bill Clinton gave us “it depends upon what the meaning of the word ‘is’ is.” James Comey has now given us it depends what the meaning of “vindicated” is.

The former FBI director sat down with Chris Wallace of Fox News Sunday over the weekend, and it didn’t go well. Wallace repeatedly pressed Comey on critical findings in the Horowitz IG report, and Comey shimmied and dodged, in a master class in slipperiness and evasion.

To this point, Comey has tended to get away with a lot in media interviews, for several reasons — he has known more about the investigations in question than anyone interviewing him; not much objective, uncontested information about those matters was publicly available; and his interviewers tended to be sympathetic to the point, at times, of sycophancy.

All of these advantages were eroded or nonexistent on Sunday. The Horowitz report has dumped a prodigious amount of material about the investigations out into the public. While Chris Wallace obviously isn’t a law-enforcement professional, he knows the factual record and, as one of the best interviewers on TV, was relentless, yet fair in grilling Comey.

It’s important to give credit to Comey for at least admitting that his previous fulsome statements defending the FISA process were wrong. He’s also on strong ground pushing back against the over-the-top charges against the FBI by the president and his defenders, often put in absurdly inflammatory terms. (Trump just the other day referred to former FBI officials as “scum.”)

But throughout the interview, Comey sought to minimize what had gone wrong in 2016, fighting a rearguard action on behalf of a position no longer worthy of defense.

Off the bat, Wallace juxtaposed Comey’s claim that the IG report was a vindication with Michael Horowitz’s congressional testimony that no one who had anything to do with the FBI’s handling of the investigation should feel vindicated.

Hence, Comey’s posture, “Well, maybe it turns upon how we understand the word.”

He relied repeatedly on such mincing distinctions. Questioned how he can square his past statement that the Steele dossier was “part of a broader mosaic of facts” supporting the Carter Page FISA application with Horowitz’s finding that it was “central and essential” in deciding to seek the FISA order, Comey said there was no contradiction.

This is absurd. It’s true that the application literally had other things in it. But Comey’s “mosaic” characterization clearly minimized the role of the dossier, whereas the Horowitz report finds that the FISA application “relied entirely” on information from the Steele reports regarding Carter Page’s alleged coordination with the Russians. The report also notes that Justice Department officials “accepted the FBI’s decision to move forward with the application, based substantially on the Steele information.”

The White House had to know about this from the start . And look , Larry , it ’ s the kind of thing… An important thing about counterintelligence… there ’ s nothing wrong with the president knowing about it . Because , unlike criminal investigations and prosecutions where we don ’ t want the political people interfering in the four corners of the case , counterintelligence is done for the president . The purpose of it is to gather intelligence , to gather information to enable the president to carry out his most important constitutional responsibility , which is protecting the country from foreign threats to national security .
The intelligence apparatus of the U.S. was spying on the opposing campaign of a presidential race . Who in the media will ask that follow up ? Also , isn ’ t it odd that Obama isn ’ t mentioned anywhere with these developments [ emphasis mine ]
Let ’ s just reflect for a moment ( with the help of Mollie Hemingway at The Federalist ) on the damning revelations in this 4,000-plus article which paint a picture of an Obama White House meddling in a presidential election at a level that would make Vladimir Putin green with envy : “ The story says the FBI was worried that if it came out they were spying on Trump campaign it would “ only reinforce his claims that the election was being rigged against him. ” It is easy to understand how learning that the FBI was spying on one ’ s presidential campaign might reinforce claims of election-rigging. ” “ Now we learn that it wasn ’ t just Page , but that the government was going after four campaign affiliates including the former campaign manager , the top foreign policy advisor , and a low-level advisor whose drunken claim supposedly launched the investigation into the campaign .

It seems like the most important question in this entire episode , wouldn ’ t you think ? Since Sen. Howard Baker uttered the question in the height of the Watergate hearings in the early 1970s we ’ ve been told that this was the most fundamental question when breaking down a presidential scandal . Yet the word “ Obama ” only appears once in the Times article and is only used to reference the president for appointing Sally Yates as Deputy Attorney General .
In March , new texts between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page seemed to suggest there was collusion between the Obama White House , CIA , FBI , and Senate Democrats concerning the Russia probe ( via Fox News ) :
Newly uncovered text messages between FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page suggest a possible coordination between high-ranking officials at the Obama White House , CIA , FBI , Justice Department and former Senate Democratic leadership in the early stages of the investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia , according to GOP congressional investigators on Wednesday . The investigators say the information provided to Fox News “ strongly ” suggests coordination between former President Barack Obama ’ s Chief of Staff Denis McDonough , then-Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid , and CIA Director John Brennan — which they say would “ contradict ” the Obama administration ’ s public stance about its hand in the process . Page texted Strzok on Aug. 2 , 2016 , saying : “ Make sure you can lawfully protect what you sign . Just thinking about congress , foia , etc . You probably know better than me. ” A text message from Strzok to Page on Aug. 3 described former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe as being concerned with “ information control ” related to the initial investigation into the Trump campaign . According to a report from the New York Times , Brennan was sent to Capitol Hill around the same time to brief members of Congress on the possibility of election interference . Days later , on Aug. 8 , 2016 , Strzok texted Page : “ Internal joint cyber cd intel piece for D , scenesetter for McDonough brief , Trainor [ head of FBI cyber division ] directed all cyber info be pulled . I ’ d let Bill and Jim hammer it out first , though it would be best for D to have it before the Wed WH session . ”
The news organization added that “ D ” was in reference to then-White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough . At the time no conclusions could be made , though one GOP congressional source told Fox News that the timeline was troubling , even possibly warranting a special investigator to see if the Obama White House was involved with this probe . Also , the FBI and CIA are supposed to act as independent agencies , not pawns for a coordinated political effort . It hasn ’ t been the FBI ’ s best moment . The bureau ’ s reputation has been scarred due to the level of bias and potential tipping of the scales that occurred concerning both the Russia and Clinton investigations . But these new revelations take it to a new level—and Obama remains under the radar , though all of this happened under his administration .","Katie wrote about it this morning.

Yet the word “Obama” only appears once in the Times article and is only used to reference the president for appointing Sally Yates as Deputy Attorney General.

Seems like a good question—believe me.

In March, new texts between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page seemed to suggest there was collusion between the Obama White House, CIA, FBI, and Senate Democrats concerning the Russia probe (via Fox News):

Newly uncovered text messages between FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page suggest a possible coordination between high-ranking officials at the Obama White House, CIA, FBI, Justice Department and former Senate Democratic leadership in the early stages of the investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, according to GOP congressional investigators on Wednesday. The investigators say the information provided to Fox News “strongly” suggests coordination between former President Barack Obama’s Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, then-Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, and CIA Director John Brennan — which they say would “contradict” the Obama administration’s public stance about its hand in the process. Page texted Strzok on Aug. 2, 2016, saying: “Make sure you can lawfully protect what you sign. Just thinking about congress, foia, etc. You probably know better than me.” A text message from Strzok to Page on Aug. 3 described former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe as being concerned with “information control” related to the initial investigation into the Trump campaign. According to a report from the New York Times, Brennan was sent to Capitol Hill around the same time to brief members of Congress on the possibility of election interference. Days later, on Aug. 8, 2016, Strzok texted Page: “Internal joint cyber cd intel piece for D, scenesetter for McDonough brief, Trainor [head of FBI cyber division] directed all cyber info be pulled. I’d let Bill and Jim hammer it out first, though it would be best for D to have it before the Wed WH session.”

The news organization added that “D” was in reference to then-White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough. At the time no conclusions could be made, though one GOP congressional source told Fox News that the timeline was troubling, even possibly warranting a special investigator to see if the Obama White House was involved with this probe. Also, the FBI and CIA are supposed to act as independent agencies, not pawns for a coordinated political effort. It hasn’t been the FBI’s best moment. The bureau’s reputation has been scarred due to the level of bias and potential tipping of the scales that occurred concerning both the Russia and Clinton investigations. But these new revelations take it to a new level—and Obama remains under the radar, though all of this happened under his administration.",www.townhall.com,right,fa6SLAos51NGItXV

US special counsel Robert Mueller has recommended a prison sentence of up to six months for former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos.

Mr Mueller, head of an investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election, said such a sentence was ""warranted and appropriate"".

Mr Papadopoulos has admitted lying about his contacts with Russians while a member of the Trump campaign team.

Sentencing is due to take place on 7 September.

""The government does not take a position with respect to a particular sentence to be imposed, but respectfully submits that a sentence of incarceration within the applicable guidelines range of zero to six months imprisonment is appropriate and warranted,"" Mr Mueller's memorandum to the judge in the case says.

The memorandum adds that Mr Papadopoulos lied to the FBI about his contacts with alleged Russian go-betweens.

""The defendant's lies undermined investigators' ability to challenge the professor or potentially detain or arrest him while he was still in the United States,"" the memorandum says.

""The defendant's false statements were intended to harm the investigation, and did so.""

Key background

Mr Papadopoulos - a Chicago-based international energy lawyer - is one of three ex-Trump campaign officials who have admitted lying to investigators, including former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and businessman Richard Gates, who served as deputy campaign chairman.

Separately, former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort faces charges of bank and tax fraud in the first trial stemming from the inquiry into alleged Russian meddling. He denies any wrongdoing.

Prosecutors say the 69-year-old dodged taxes on millions of dollars he made lobbying for Ukrainian politicians.

Members of the jury are now deciding their verdict - with their identities protected over safety concerns after the judge in the case admitted he had received threats himself.

If found guilty on the fraud charges, Mr Manafort could spend the rest of his life in jail.

The allegations against him are not linked to Mr Trump and centre on his consultancy work with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine.",www.bbc.com,center,t6IDJoP8ifca7wnZ
fbi,Fox Online News,2,https://www.foxnews.com/media/tucker-carlson-fisa-report-cnn-false-narrative-trump,Tucker Carlson: Horowitz report exposed CNN's Trump-FISA narratives as misleading,,Charles Creitz,"Tucker Carlson said Wednesday Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz 's report on Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) abuse during the 2016 election exposed misleading or false narratives spread on CNN .
The `` Tucker Carlson Tonight '' host said many network hosts , contributors and guests had tried to convince viewers the Steele dossier was `` totally irrelevant '' to the FISA warrant application .
He criticized CNN primetime anchor Don Lemon , who had accused the Trump administration of `` gaslighting '' the American people in response to both President Trump 's impeachment proceedings and the Horowtiz report .
`` There was no spying of course . The FBI obtained proper warrants to read the report ... Facts first , '' claimed Lemon , who added that the report purportedly found the Russia probe 's origins `` legally sound '' and `` unbiased . ''
SEN. JOHN KENNEDY SAYS HE 'THOUGHT I HAD DROPPED ACID ' WHILE READING DOJ IG REPORT
In response , Carlson said Lemon was irresponsibly doubling down on a false narrative , adding the report did not express what the CNN host claimed it did .
`` 'Facts first ' , that 's kind of his motto -- wizened old newsman that he is , '' Carlson said sarcastically .
`` [ New York ] Governor [ Andrew ] Cuomo 's brother agrees with that , '' he added , referring to Lemon 's fellow CNN primetime host Chris Cuomo .
In a recent clip , the younger Cuomo mocked Trump for claiming he is a `` victim '' in the midst of the FISA firestorm .
`` [ The president ] is lying to you about the report . Please do yourself the favor , do the homework -- he 's lying to you , '' Cuomo continued .
Carlson remarked in response that he believed Cuomo himself has not done the `` homework '' he assigned his viewers .
`` Unless he is a pathological liar , Chris Cuomo did n't actually read the IG report , '' he said . `` Otherwise , he would not have sat in the television studio , stared into the camera and pretended that the Justice Department inspector general just confirmed what CNN has been telling you for three years . ''
Carlson also singled out CNN anchor and former Obama administration staffer Jim Scuitto -- who in a 2018 tweet claimed the FBI would `` further corroborate information in the [ Steele ] dossier ... before using such intel to justify the FISA warrant . ''
`` In other words , you can believe your government , ladies and gentlemen , and anyone who doubts that is a bad person , '' Carlson said .
`` Of course , that was a lie too . It did n't happen . In fact , just the opposite happened , '' the host added .
He said the Horowitz report showed the FBI instead hid information exposing the dossier as false and pretended it had been authenticated .
The host said Scuitto was incorrect `` at best '' and had not yet issued a correction .
`` He was too busy tweeting a Nancy Pelosi quote about how solemn impeachment was . What a shill . ''
Carlson added that CNN was not alone in what he claimed was their misleading coverage , but also criticized NBC News intelligence correspondent Ken Dilanian , who tweeted in 2018 that Trump is `` wrong about Carter Page , the dossier and the FISA warrant . ''

Islamic State militants have released several videos in recent months depicting the beheadings of American, French and English citizens, including journalists and aid workers. The narrator and executioner in those videos has a British accent and has been identified by counterterrorism officials. In contrast, the propaganda video, entitled “The Flames of War,” features a fluent English speaker, apparently a recruitment tool designed to lure additional Westerners to the terror organization.

More On This...

An intelligence official close to the matter said the executioner, if confirmed to be an American citizen, will be the first documented case of a U.S. citizen engaging in a mass execution for the ISIS terror network.

FBI Director James Comey said last month that about 12 Americans are believed to be fighting alongside extremist groups in Syria, not more than 100 as had been cited for months.

“When I use a number of more than 100, that means people who have gone and come back, people who have attempted to go and we locked them up, people who have gone and stayed,” Comey told reporters at FBI headquarters. “The figure that I’ve been operating with is, ballparkish, a dozen still there fighting with terrorist groups.”

On Saturday, a 19-year-old Chicago man was arrested for allegedly attempting to travel overseas to join the militants. But federal officials are quick to point out that the threat of U.S. citizens going abroad to fight alongside jihadists is not new. In 2010, another Chicago man was imprisoned for planning to travel to Somalia to join al Shabaab. And last year, an Albanian man living in Brooklyn, N.Y., was sentenced to 15 years in prison for attempting to travel to Pakistan to join terror organizations.

U.S. intelligence officials estimate there are about 15,000 foreign fighters in Iraq and Syria fighting alongside extremist groups, including the Islamic State. At least two Americans have been killed and at least 13 have been arrested. The precise number is a “big unknown,” said Derek Harvey, a former Defense Intelligence Agency official who advises the Pentagon’s Central Command.

“The director is talking about information that they have that is solid,” Harvey told The Associated Press last month in regards to Comey’s remarks. “But there’s a lot of unknowns, and I think that’s why there’s a lot of concern.”

FBI officials have not publicly released the identity of a British-accented masked man in videos depicting the beheadings of American reporters James Foley and Steven Sotloff and a British aid worker, David Haines.

Islamic State militants said in a video after the beheading of a fourth person last week, British aid worker Alan Henning, that an Indiana aid worker, 26-year-old Peter Kassig, a former Army ranger, would be next. Kassig's parents pleaded for their son's freedom in a video statement released Saturday.

Kassig, who reportedly converted to Islam and took the name Abdul-Rahman, was taken captive by the Islamic State group Oct. 1, 2013, in Syria, where he was providing aid for refugees fleeing that country's civil war.

Comey, meanwhile, addressed the issue on Sunday during an interview on ""60 Minutes.""

“These homegrown violent extremists are troubled souls who are seeking meaning in some misguided way,” he said. “And so they come across the propaganda and they become radicalized on their own independent study, and they’re also able to equip themselves with training again on the Internet, and then engage in jihad after emerging from their basement.”

Although use of cameras is considered a good practice , neither the D.C. field office nor a cross-border task force assigned to major narcotics cases in the metropolitan area had them in their evidence rooms , according to a letter sent to 13 defense attorneys in a pending drug conspiracy case .
The details were revealed in court filings involving Matthew Lowry , an FBI agent suspected of pilfering heroin seized in federal narcotics investigations . Prosecutors have sought dismissal of charges against more than two dozen defendants after the investigation into Mr. Lowry was revealed .
Defense lawyers say the lax controls call into question other investigations where FBI agents had custody of critical evidence .
“ If there ’ s a problem in the FBI evidence room , and it ’ s just a room with shelves and anybody can walk in and out , that would have huge implications as far as the trustworthiness of evidence , ” defense lawyer A. Eduardo Balarezo said in an interview .
The lack of cameras was made public in a defense motion filed in a major drug conspiracy case pending in federal court in Washington . Prosecutors are reviewing their case amid the misconduct probe into Mr. Lowry , who has been accused of taking heroin and guns seized by his agency .
Mr. Balarezo said Mr. Lowry was able to check out evidence for extended periods for no apparent purpose .
On Monday , Mr. Balarezo filed a motion asking a judge to order prosecutors to produce all procedures at the FBI field office and task force for logging in and removing evidence .
No federal requirements govern evidence rooms , but video surveillance is considered a best practice to help ensure the integrity of evidence and some states and localities do mandate it , said Joe Latta , executive director for the International Association for Property and Evidence Inc .
“ If you look at general law enforcement , I ’ d say more don ’ t have video surveillance than do , ” Mr. Latta said . “ Should they ? Absolutely . But the evidence room is sometimes low on the food chain in the organization . ”
His organization has been recommending cameras for years , saying surveillance of the door or the room ’ s interior is “ an excellent control . ”
Mr. Latta said the FBI isn ’ t the only law enforcement agency to be hit with thefts in the evidence room .
“ I ’ ve got thousands of headlines and that ’ s no exaggeration , ” he said . “ Every day there is something going on . ”
The U.S. attorney ’ s office in Washington has sought dismissal of charges against at least 28 defendants in recent weeks since disclosing the investigation into Mr. Lowry .
The cases involve major narcotics cases that can take a year or more to investigate and include undercover drug buys and wiretaps .
The FBI did not respond by deadline to questions about the lack of cameras in the evidence control rooms but previously said the agency took “ immediate steps ” to address “ the incident ” involving Mr. Lowry and referred the misconduct accusations to the Justice Department ’ s office of inspector general .
Mr. Balarezo ’ s motion , however , raises broader questions about the reliability of FBI evidence . Prosecutors said Mr. Lowry acted alone , but the defense lawyer said the lack of controls could implicate the way evidence has been collected and secured by other agents , too .
At any trial , he said , the government would argue that evidence was handled properly within a strict chain of custody .
But if Mr. Lowry was able to avoid logging seized evidence and remove it for extended periods , then “ it would stand to reason that the strict chain of custody claimed by the government in most cases is a sham , ” Mr. Balarezo said .","The FBI’s evidence-handling controls are so lax that the agency didn’t have video cameras in its Washington field office evidence room, according to court documents that lawyers say could be used to call into question any number of convictions.

He was under oath when he lied to the FBI agents , the inspector general said in a lengthy new report that could prove devastating to Mr. McCabe ’ s credibility , and to other ongoing investigations .
“ He LIED ! LIED ! LIED ! ” President Trump tweeted . “ McCabe was totally controlled by Comey - McCabe is Comey ! ! No collusion , all made up by this den of thieves and lowlifes ! ”
The inspector general ’ s report , which had been circulating inside the government for weeks , was used to justify Mr. McCabe ’ s firing earlier this year , just days before he was to take retirement and collect his pension .
The inspector general said Mr. McCabe authorized leaks to a Wall Street Journal reporter when he was trying to shape the narrative surrounding his role in the investigation into Hillary Clinton ’ s secret emails .
Investigators said the 2016 leak confirmed the existence of an investigation into the Clinton Foundation — a probe the FBI had studiously avoided confirming . The leak was inappropriate because it was done “ to advance his personal interests , ” the audit found .
He then lied to Mr. Comey , then to FBI agents and the inspector general in May and July 2017 . In a follow-up interview late last year he “ contradicted his prior statements , ” the audit concluded .
“ The OIG found that then-Deputy Director Andrew McCabe lacked candor , including under oath , on multiple occasions in connection with describing his role in connection with a disclosure to the WSJ , and that this conduct violated FBI Offense Codes 2.5 and 2.6 , ” the audit concluded .
“ The OIG also concluded that McCabe ’ s disclosure of the existence of an ongoing investigation in the manner described in this report violated the FBI ’ s and the Department ’ s media policy and constituted misconduct . ”
Investigators said they were cognizant Mr. McCabe ’ s leaks were likely meant to counter opposition leaks from within the FBI , but they said that wasn ’ t a reason to leak .
The report also delves into several other thorny issues of the 2016 campaign .
One of those is an Aug. 12 , 2016 , call to Mr. McCabe from a high-ranking Justice Department official who complained that FBI agents ’ investigation into the Clinton Foundation was too “ overt , ” particularly in the middle of a presidential campaign .
Mr. McCabe said he got the sense the Obama Justice Department was telling him “ to shut down ” the probe . Later he called the exchange as “ very dramatic ” and said he ’ d never had a confrontation like that with the Justice Department .
The justice official , who was not named in the report , confirmed the general tenor of the call to investigators , but denied he was trying to pressure the FBI to stop the probe .
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte said his panel is already looking into those matters , and the report provides further evidence of the need to figure out what was going on at the Justice Department .
The new report is likely to fuel President Trump ’ s complaints about the FBI , about special counsel Robert Mueller ’ s probe into his own behavior and that of his 2016 campaign , and about Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , who is overseeing Mr. Mueller .
“ The report issued by the Inspector General today has absolutely nothing to do with Special Counsel Mueller , Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein , the conduct of federal investigators so far , or the multiple indictments they have secured against Russian nationals and Trump campaign officials , ” said Rep.

Still , he said , “ President Trump will no doubt gloat about these findings and misuse them in his ongoing disinformation campaign . ”
Rep. Trey Gowdy , Republican South Carolina and chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , said the report justifies Mr. McCabe ’ s firing . He vowed that his committee will continue to investigate the FBI ’ s decisions on investigations related to the 2016 election .

“If the election had been on 27 October, I would be your president,” the former Democratic presidential candidate said.

The FBI director said that the discovery in October of a new batch classified emails put him in a near impossible dilemma. He said he had to make a choice between “speak or conceal”: to speak would have been “really bad”, he said; to conceal would have been “catastrophic”. So he chose to speak out.

“One of my junior lawyers asked me: should you consider what you do might help elect Trump as president? I said: not for a moment,” Comey said, arguing that political considerations should never be a factor in such decisions.

Trump responded to Clinton’s comments on Tuesday with a tweet claiming: “FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds!” – an apparent reference to the bureau’s finding that there was nothing to prosecute in the emails case.

Asked about the criticism on Wednesday, the White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, told journalists: “The president has confidence in the director.”

He was asked repeatedly about the contrast between his decision to break silence on the Clinton email case while concealing the existence of a counter-intelligence investigation into the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russian officials during the election.



Comey said that when he first spoke about the Clinton case, in July 2016, he did so because the investigation had been closed, no charges had been made, and he felt that if the Department of Justice in the Obama administration made the announcement it would lose credibility. The discovery of more emails in October might have changed that decision and represented an important development, he added.

The Trump-Russia counter-intelligence investigation, he argued, was highly classified and was in its “very early stages” by the time of the election.

He confirmed that the inquiry was continuing, and agreed when asked whether it was “fair to say that Russia is still involved in American politics”. He went further, describing Russia as “the greatest threat of any nation on earth, given their intention and their capability” to US democracy.

Asked about Comey’s claim that the Russian government is still involved in US politics, Spicer replied: “I think that’s the view of the FBI. We rely on them and the rest of the intelligence community to provide the president with updates on what they’re learning.”



At his hearing, Comey was peppered with questions about leaks about FBI investigations, and repeatedly stated he could neither confirm or deny.

He made one exception, however. Asked about contacts between FBI staff and Rudy Giuliani, a former New York mayor and current Trump aide, he said: “I don’t know yet, but it’s a matter I’m very, very interested in.”

Comey described in detail the process of discovering Clinton’s emails on the laptop of Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin.

He said that “somehow” Clinton’s emails “were being forwarded to Anthony Weiner, including classified information, by her assistant Huma Abedin”. Weiner was being investigated over an alleged online relationship with a teenage girl.

Republican Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the committee, said that the public’s faith in the bureau had been tested lately. Grassley is pressing for answers about the FBI’s investigation into potential coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Comey disclosed the existence of that investigation when he testified at a congressional hearing in March.

Comey also mounted a strong defence of section 702 of the Fisa Amendments Act of 2008, which allows the NSA to use the Prism program to collect internet communications. And he claimed that half the FBI’s work was now affected by encryption on users’ phones or other devices.",www.theguardian.com,left,v1y3NQktTaDFDKaN

( Yuri Gripas/Reuters )
Trey Gowdy and Marco Rubio evidently paid little attention to testimony before their own committees on how Obama officials made the Trump campaign the subject of a counterintelligence investigation .
Well , well , well . The bipartisan Beltway establishment has apparently had its fill of this “ Trump colluded with Russia ” narrative — the same narrative the same establishment has lustily peddled for nearly two years . The Obama administration recklessly chose to deploy the government ’ s awesome counterintelligence powers to investigate — and , more to the point , to smear — its political opposition as a Kremlin confederate . Now that this ploy has blown up on the Justice Department and the FBI , these agencies — the ones that went out of their way , and outside their guidelines , to announce to the world that the Trump campaign was under investigation — want you to know the president and his campaign were not investigated at all , no siree .
What could possibly have made you imagine such a thing ?
And so , to douse the controversy with cold water , dutifully stepping forward in fine bipartisan fettle are the Obama administration ’ s top intelligence official and two influential Capitol Hill Republicans who evidently pay little attention to major testimony before their own committees .
Former National Intelligence director James Clapper was first to the scene of the blaze . Clapper concedes that , well , yes , the FBI did run an informant — “ spy ” is such an icky word — at Trump campaign officials ; but you must understand that this was merely to investigate Russia . Cross his heart , it had nothing to do with the Trump campaign . No , no , no . Indeed , they only used an informant because — bet you didn ’ t know this — doing so is the most benign , least intrusive mode of conducting an investigation .
Me ? I ’ m thinking the tens of thousands of convicts serving lengthy sentences due to the penetration of their schemes by informants would beg to differ . ( Mr. Gambino , I assure you , this was just for you own good . . . ) In any event , I ’ ll leave it to the reader to imagine the Democrats ’ response if , say , the Bush administration had run a covert intelligence operative against Obama 2008 campaign officials , including the campaign ’ s co-chairman . I ’ m sure David Axelrod , Chuck Schumer , the New York Times , and Rachel Maddow would chirp that “ all is forgiven ” once they heard Republicans punctiliously parse the nuances between investigating campaign officials versus the campaign proper ; between “ spies , ” “ informants , ” and other government-directed covert operatives .
Then there are Senator Marco Rubio ( R. , Fla. ) and Representative Trey Gowdy ( R. , S.C. ) , General Clapper ’ s fellow fire extinguishers .
Rubio is a member in good standing of that Washington pillar , the Senate Intelligence Committee , which has had about as much interest in scrutinizing the highly irregular actions of intelligence and law-enforcement officials in the Clinton and Russia probes as Gowdy ’ s Benghazi committee had in revisiting Republican ardor for Obama ’ s unprovoked war on Moammar Qaddafi . ( That would be : roughly zero interest . )
Rubio told ABC News that he has seen “ no evidence ” that the FBI was gathering information about the Trump campaign . Rather , agents “ were investigating individuals with a history of links to Russia that were concerning. ” The senator elaborated that “ when individuals like that are in the orbit of a major political campaign in America , the FBI , who is in charge of counterintelligence investigations , should look at people like that . ”
Gee , senator , when you were carefully perusing the evidence of what the FBI was doing , did you ever sneak a peek at what the FBI said it was doing ?
May I suggest , for example , the stunning public testimony by then-director James Comey on March 20 , 2017 , before the House Intelligence Committee — perhaps Representative Gowdy , who sits on that committee , could lend you the transcript , since he appears not to be using it . Just so we ’ re clear , this is not an obscure scrap of evidence buried within volumes of testimony . It is the testimony that launched the Mueller probe , and that sets ( or , better , fails to set ) the parameters of that probe — a flaw the nation has been discussing for a year .
Comey ’ s House testimony was breathtaking , not just because it confirmed the existence of a classified counterintelligence investigation , but because of what the bureau ’ s then-director said about the Trump campaign ( my italics ) :
I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI , as part of our counterintelligence mission , is investigating the Russian government ’ s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia ’ s efforts . . . .
That is an unambiguous declaration that the FBI was investigating the Trump campaign . That is why , for nearly two years , Washington has been entranced by the specter of “ Trump collusion with Russia , ” not “ Papadopoulos collusion with Russia. ” A campaign , of course , is an entity that acts through the individuals associated with it . But Comey went to extraordinary lengths to announce that the FBI was not merely zeroing in on individuals of varying ranks in the campaign ; the main question was whether the Trump campaign itself — the entity — had “ coordinated ” in Russia ’ s espionage operation .
Gowdy ’ s fire truck pulled into Fox News Tuesday night for an interview by Martha MacCallum . An able lawyer , the congressman is suddenly on a mission to protect the Justice Department and the FBI from further criticism . So , when Ms. MacCallum posed the question about the FBI spying on the Trump campaign , Gowdy deftly changed the subject : Rather than address the campaign , he repeatedly insisted that Donald Trump personally was never the “ target ” of the FBI ’ s investigation . The only “ target , ” Gowdy maintains , was Russia .

We ’ ll come momentarily to the closely connected question of whether Trump can be airbrushed out of his own campaign — I suspect the impossibility of this feat is why Gowdy is resistant to discussing the Trump campaign at all .
It is a diversion for Gowdy to prattle on about how Trump himself was not a “ target ” of the Russia investigation . As we ’ ve repeatedly observed ( and as Gowdy acknowledged in the interview ) , the Trump-Russia probe is a counterintelligence investigation . An accomplished prosecutor , Gowdy well knows that “ target ” is a term of art in criminal investigations , denoting a suspect who is likely to be indicted . The term is inapposite to counterintelligence investigations , which are not about building criminal cases but about divining and thwarting the provocative schemes of hostile foreign powers . In that sense , and in no other , the foreign power at issue — here , Russia — is always the “ target ” of a counterintelligence probe ; but it is never a “ target ” in the technical criminal-investigation sense in which Gowdy used the term . . . unless you think we are going to indict a country .
Apart from the fact that Gowdy is dodging the question about whether the Trump campaign was being investigated , his digression about ‘ targets ’ is gibberish .
Moreover , even if we stick to the criminal-investigation sense of “ target , ” Gowdy knows it is misleading to emphasize that Trump is not one . Just a few short weeks ago , Gowdy was heard pooh-poohing as “ meaningless ” media reporting that Trump had been advised he was not a “ target ” of Special Counsel Robert Mueller ’ s probe ( which is the current iteration of the Russia investigation ) . As the congressman quite correctly pointed out , if Trump is a subject of the investigation — another criminal-law term of art , denoting a person whose conduct is under scrutiny , but who may or may not be indicted — it should be of little comfort that he is not a “ target ” ; depending on how the evidence shakes out , a subject can become a target in the blink of an eye .
So , apart from the fact that Gowdy is dodging the question about whether the Trump campaign was being investigated , his digression about “ targets ” is gibberish . Since the Obama administration was using its counterintelligence powers ( FISA surveillance , national-security letters , unmasking identities in intelligence reporting , all bolstered by the use of at least one covert informant ) , the political-spying issue boils down to whether the Trump campaign was being monitored . Whether Trump himself was apt to be indicted , and whether threats posed by Russia were the FBI ’ s focus , are beside the point ; in a counterintelligence case , an indictment is never the objective , and a foreign power is always the focus .

If this has slipped Gowdy mind , perhaps Rubio could lend him the transcript of Comey ’ s testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee — in particular , a section Rubio seems not to remember , either .
A little background . On January 6 , 2017 , Comey , Clapper , CIA director John Brennan , and NSA chief Michael Rogers visited President-elect Trump in New York to brief him on the Russia investigation . Just one day earlier , at the White House , Comey and then–acting attorney general Sally Yates had met with the political leadership of the Obama administration — President Obama , Vice President Biden , and national-security adviser Susan Rice — to discuss withholding information about the Russia investigation from the incoming Trump administration .
Ms. Rice put this sleight-of-hand a bit more delicately in her CYA memo-to-file about the Oval Office meeting ( written two weeks after the fact , as Rice was leaving her office minutes after Trump ’ s inauguration ) :
President Obama said he wants to be sure that , as we engage with the incoming team , we are mindful to ascertain if there is any reason that we can not share information fully as it relates to Russia . [ Emphasis added . ]
It is easy to understand why Obama officials needed to discuss withholding information from Trump . They knew that the Trump campaign — not just some individuals tangentially connected to the campaign — was the subject of an ongoing FBI counterintelligence probe . Indeed , we now know that Obama ’ s Justice Department had already commenced FISA surveillance on Trump campaign figures , and that it was preparing to return to the FISA court to seek renewal of the surveillance warrants . We also know that at least one informant was still deployed . And we know that the FBI withheld information about the investigation from the congressional “ Gang of Eight ” during quarterly briefings from July 2106 through early March 2017 . ( See Comey testimony March 20 , 2017 , questioning by Representative Elise Stefanik ( R. , N.Y. ) . ) Director Comey said Congress ’ s most trusted leaders were not apprised of the investigation because “ it was a matter of such sensitivity. ” Putting aside that the need to alert Congress to sensitive matters is exactly why there is a Gang of Eight , the palpable reason why the matter was deemed too “ sensitive ” for disclosure was that it involved the incumbent administration ’ s investigation of the opposition campaign .
Clearly , the Obama officials did not want Trump to know the full scope of their investigation of his campaign . But just as important , they wanted the investigation — an “ insurance policy ” that promised to hamstring Trump ’ s presidency — to continue .
Clearly , the Obama officials did not want Trump to know the full scope of their investigation of his campaign .
So , how to accomplish these objectives ? Plainly , the plan called for Comey to put the new president at ease by telling him he was not a suspect . This would not have been a credible assurance if Comey had informed Trump that his campaign had been under investigation for months , suspected of coordinating in Russia ’ s cyber-espionage operation . So , information would be withheld . The intelligence chiefs would tell Trump only about Russia ’ s espionage , not about the Trump campaign ’ s suspected “ coordination ” with the Kremlin . Then , Comey would apprise Trump about only a sliver of the Steele dossier — just the lurid story about peeing prostitutes , not the dossier ’ s principal allegations of a traitorous Trump-Russia conspiracy .
As I ’ ve previously recounted , this did not sit well with everyone at the FBI . Shortly before he met with Trump , Comey consulted his top FBI advisers about the plan to tell Trump he was not a suspect . There was an objection from one of Comey ’ s top advisers — we don ’ t know which one . Comey recounted this disagreement for the Senate Intelligence Committee ( my italics ) :
One of the members of the leadership team had a view that , although it was technically true [ that ] we did not have a counterintelligence file case open on then-President-elect Trump [ , ] . . . because we ’ re looking at the potential . . . coordination between the campaign and Russia , because it was . . . President-elect Trump ’ s campaign , this person ’ s view was , inevitably , [ Trump ’ s ] behavior , [ Trump ’ s ] conduct will fall within the scope of that work .
Representative Gowdy and Senator Rubio might want to read that testimony over a few times .
They might note that Comey did not talk about “ potential coordination between Carter Page or Paul Manafort and Russia. ” The director was unambiguous : The FBI was investigating “ potential coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia. ” With due respect to Gowdy , the FBI did not regard Russia as the “ target ” ; to the contrary , Comey said the focus of the investigation was whether Donald Trump ’ s campaign had coordinated in Russia ’ s election interference . And perspicaciously , Comey ’ s unidentified adviser connected the dots : Because ( a ) the FBI ’ s investigation was about the campaign , and ( b ) the campaign was Trump ’ s campaign , it was necessarily true that ( c ) Trump ’ s own conduct was under FBI scrutiny .
Director Comey ’ s reliance on the trivial administrative fact that the FBI had not written Trump ’ s name on the investigative file did not change the reality that Trump , manifestly , was a subject of the “ Crossfire Hurricane ” investigation . If Trump were not a subject of the investigation , there would be no conceivable justification for Special Counsel Mueller to be pushing to interview the president of the United States . If Trump were not a subject of the investigation , Trump ’ s political opponents would not have spent the last 18 months accusing him of obstruction and demanding that Mueller be permitted to finish his work .
In the interview with Ms. MacCallum , Representative Gowdy further confused matters by stressing Trump ’ s observation , in a phone conversation with Comey on March 30 , 2017 , that it would be good to find out if underlings in his campaign had done anything wrong . This , according to Gowdy , means Trump should be pleased , rather than outraged , by what the FBI did : By steering an informant at three campaign officials , we ’ re to believe that the bureau was doing exactly what Trump suggested .
Gowdy ’ s argument assumes something that is simply not true : namely , that the Trump campaign was not under investigation .
Such a specious argument . So disappointing to hear it from someone who clearly knows better .
First , the informant reportedly began approaching campaign officials in July 2016 . It was nine months later , well after the election , when President Trump told Comey that if would be good if the FBI uncovered any wrongdoing by his “ satellites. ” Trump was not endorsing spying during the campaign ; the campaign was long over . The president was saying that it would be worth continuing the FBI ’ s Russia investigation in order to root out any thus-far-undiscovered wrongdoing — but only if the FBI informed the public that Trump was not a suspect ( an announcement Comey declined to make ) .
Second , Gowdy ’ s argument assumes something that is simply not true : namely , that the Trump campaign was not under investigation . As we ’ ve seen , Comey testified multiple times that the FBI was investigating the Trump campaign for possible coordination with Russia . The bureau was not , as Gowdy suggests , merely investigating a few campaign officials for suspicious contacts with Russia unrelated to the campaign .
That brings us to a final point . In support of the neon-flashing fact that the Trump campaign was under investigation when the Obama administration ran an informant at it , there is much more than former Director Comey ’ s testimony .
Probes conducted by both the House Intelligence Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee have established that the Obama Justice Department and the FBI used the Steele dossier to obtain FISA-court warrants against Carter Page . The dossier , a Clinton-campaign opposition-research project ( a fact withheld from the FISA court ) , was essential to the required probable-cause showing ; the FBI ’ s former deputy director , Andrew McCabe , testified that without the dossier there would have been no warrant .
So . . . what did the dossier say ? The lion ’ s share of it — the part Director Comey omitted from his briefing of Trump — alleged that the Trump campaign was conspiring with the Kremlin to corrupt the election , including by hacking and publicizing Democratic-party emails .
We also know , thanks to more testimony by Director Comey , that dossier information was presented to the FISA court because the Justice Department and the FBI found former British spy Christopher Steele to be reliable ( even if they could not corroborate Steele ’ s unidentified Russian sources ) . That is , the FBI and Justice Department believed Steele ’ s claim that the Trump campaign was willfully complicit in Russia ’ s treachery .
It is a major investigative step to seek surveillance warrants from the FISA court . Unlike using an informant , for which no court authorization is necessary , applications for FISA surveillance require approvals at the highest levels of the Justice Department and the FBI . After going through that elaborate process , the Obama Justice Department and the FBI presented to the court the dossier ’ s allegations that the Trump campaign was coordinating with Russia to undermine the 2016 election .
If that was their position under oath before a secret United States court , why would anyone conceivably believe that it was not their position when they ran an informant at members of the campaign they were investigating ?
To be sure , no sensible person argues that the FBI should refrain from investigating individuals suspected of acting as clandestine agents of a hostile foreign power . The question is : How should such an investigation proceed in a democratic republic whose norms forbid an incumbent administration , in the absence of strong evidence of egregious misconduct , from directing its counterintelligence and law-enforcement powers against its political opposition ?
That norm was flouted by the Justice Department and the FBI , under the direction of the Obama administration ’ s senior political leadership . Representative Gowdy , Senator Rubio , and General Clapper maintain that the Justice Department and the FBI were just doing what we should expect them to do , and that we should applaud them . But this claim is based on the easily refuted fiction that the Justice Department and FBI were not investigating the Trump campaign . The claim also ignores the stubborn fact that , if all the Obama administration had been trying to do was check out a few bad apples with suspicious Russia ties , this could easily have been done by alerting the Trump campaign and asking for its help .
Instead , Obama officials made the Trump campaign the subject of a counterintelligence investigation .","FBI Director James Comey at the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., June 18, 2015. (Yuri Gripas/Reuters)

As we’ve repeatedly observed (and as Gowdy acknowledged in the interview), the Trump-Russia probe is a counterintelligence investigation. An accomplished prosecutor, Gowdy well knows that “target” is a term of art in criminal investigations, denoting a suspect who is likely to be indicted. The term is inapposite to counterintelligence investigations, which are not about building criminal cases but about divining and thwarting the provocative schemes of hostile foreign powers. In that sense, and in no other, the foreign power at issue — here, Russia — is always the “target” of a counterintelligence probe; but it is never a “target” in the technical criminal-investigation sense in which Gowdy used the term . . . unless you think we are going to indict a country.

Apart from the fact that Gowdy is dodging the question about whether the Trump campaign was being investigated, his digression about ‘targets’ is gibberish.

Moreover, even if we stick to the criminal-investigation sense of “target,” Gowdy knows it is misleading to emphasize that Trump is not one.

They knew that the Trump campaign — not just some individuals tangentially connected to the campaign — was the subject of an ongoing FBI counterintelligence probe. Indeed, we now know that Obama’s Justice Department had already commenced FISA surveillance on Trump campaign figures, and that it was preparing to return to the FISA court to seek renewal of the surveillance warrants. We also know that at least one informant was still deployed. And we know that the FBI withheld information about the investigation from the congressional “Gang of Eight” during quarterly briefings from July 2106 through early March 2017. (See Comey testimony March 20, 2017, questioning by Representative Elise Stefanik (R., N.Y.).) Director Comey said Congress’s most trusted leaders were not apprised of the investigation because “it was a matter of such sensitivity.” Putting aside that the need to alert Congress to sensitive matters is exactly why there is a Gang of Eight, the palpable reason why the matter was deemed too “sensitive” for disclosure was that it involved the incumbent administration’s investigation of the opposition campaign.

Clearly, the Obama officials did not want Trump to know the full scope of their investigation of his campaign. But just as important, they wanted the investigation — an “insurance policy” that promised to hamstring Trump’s presidency — to continue.

Clearly, the Obama officials did not want Trump to know the full scope of their investigation of his campaign.

So, how to accomplish these objectives? Plainly, the plan called for Comey to put the new president at ease by telling him he was not a suspect. This would not have been a credible assurance if Comey had informed Trump that his campaign had been under investigation for months, suspected of coordinating in Russia’s cyber-espionage operation. So, information would be withheld. The intelligence chiefs would tell Trump only about Russia’s espionage, not about the Trump campaign’s suspected “coordination” with the Kremlin. Then, Comey would apprise Trump about only a sliver of the Steele dossier — just the lurid story about peeing prostitutes, not the dossier’s principal allegations of a traitorous Trump-Russia conspiracy.

As I’ve previously recounted, this did not sit well with everyone at the FBI. Shortly before he met with Trump, Comey consulted his top FBI advisers about the plan to tell Trump he was not a suspect. There was an objection from one of Comey’s top advisers — we don’t know which one. Comey recounted this disagreement for the Senate Intelligence Committee (my italics):

One of the members of the leadership team had a view that, although it was technically true [that] we did not have a counterintelligence file case open on then-President-elect Trump[,] . . . because we’re looking at the potential . . . coordination between the campaign and Russia, because it was . . . President-elect Trump’s campaign, this person’s view was, inevitably, [Trump’s] behavior, [Trump’s] conduct will fall within the scope of that work.

Representative Gowdy and Senator Rubio might want to read that testimony over a few times.

They might note that Comey did not talk about “potential coordination between Carter Page or Paul Manafort and Russia.” The director was unambiguous: The FBI was investigating “potential coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia.” With due respect to Gowdy, the FBI did not regard Russia as the “target”; to the contrary, Comey said the focus of the investigation was whether Donald Trump’s campaign had coordinated in Russia’s election interference. And perspicaciously, Comey’s unidentified adviser connected the dots: Because (a) the FBI’s investigation was about the campaign, and (b) the campaign was Trump’s campaign, it was necessarily true that (c) Trump’s own conduct was under FBI scrutiny.

Director Comey’s reliance on the trivial administrative fact that the FBI had not written Trump’s name on the investigative file did not change the reality that Trump, manifestly, was a subject of the “Crossfire Hurricane” investigation. If Trump were not a subject of the investigation, there would be no conceivable justification for Special Counsel Mueller to be pushing to interview the president of the United States. If Trump were not a subject of the investigation, Trump’s political opponents would not have spent the last 18 months accusing him of obstruction and demanding that Mueller be permitted to finish his work.

In the interview with Ms. MacCallum, Representative Gowdy further confused matters by stressing Trump’s observation, in a phone conversation with Comey on March 30, 2017, that it would be good to find out if underlings in his campaign had done anything wrong. This, according to Gowdy, means Trump should be pleased, rather than outraged, by what the FBI did: By steering an informant at three campaign officials, we’re to believe that the bureau was doing exactly what Trump suggested.

Gowdy’s argument assumes something that is simply not true: namely, that the Trump campaign was not under investigation.

Such a specious argument. So disappointing to hear it from someone who clearly knows better.

First, the informant reportedly began approaching campaign officials in July 2016. It was nine months later, well after the election, when President Trump told Comey that if would be good if the FBI uncovered any wrongdoing by his “satellites.” Trump was not endorsing spying during the campaign; the campaign was long over. The president was saying that it would be worth continuing the FBI’s Russia investigation in order to root out any thus-far-undiscovered wrongdoing — but only if the FBI informed the public that Trump was not a suspect (an announcement Comey declined to make).

Second, Gowdy’s argument assumes something that is simply not true: namely, that the Trump campaign was not under investigation. As we’ve seen, Comey testified multiple times that the FBI was investigating the Trump campaign for possible coordination with Russia. The bureau was not, as Gowdy suggests, merely investigating a few campaign officials for suspicious contacts with Russia unrelated to the campaign.

The Steele Dossier and FISA Surveillance

That brings us to a final point. In support of the neon-flashing fact that the Trump campaign was under investigation when the Obama administration ran an informant at it, there is much more than former Director Comey’s testimony.

Probes conducted by both the House Intelligence Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee have established that the Obama Justice Department and the FBI used the Steele dossier to obtain FISA-court warrants against Carter Page. The dossier, a Clinton-campaign opposition-research project (a fact withheld from the FISA court), was essential to the required probable-cause showing; the FBI’s former deputy director, Andrew McCabe, testified that without the dossier there would have been no warrant.

So . . . what did the dossier say? The lion’s share of it — the part Director Comey omitted from his briefing of Trump — alleged that the Trump campaign was conspiring with the Kremlin to corrupt the election, including by hacking and publicizing Democratic-party emails.

We also know, thanks to more testimony by Director Comey, that dossier information was presented to the FISA court because the Justice Department and the FBI found former British spy Christopher Steele to be reliable (even if they could not corroborate Steele’s unidentified Russian sources). That is, the FBI and Justice Department believed Steele’s claim that the Trump campaign was willfully complicit in Russia’s treachery.

It is a major investigative step to seek surveillance warrants from the FISA court. Unlike using an informant, for which no court authorization is necessary, applications for FISA surveillance require approvals at the highest levels of the Justice Department and the FBI. After going through that elaborate process, the Obama Justice Department and the FBI presented to the court the dossier’s allegations that the Trump campaign was coordinating with Russia to undermine the 2016 election.

If that was their position under oath before a secret United States court, why would anyone conceivably believe that it was not their position when they ran an informant at members of the campaign they were investigating?

To be sure, no sensible person argues that the FBI should refrain from investigating individuals suspected of acting as clandestine agents of a hostile foreign power. The question is: How should such an investigation proceed in a democratic republic whose norms forbid an incumbent administration, in the absence of strong evidence of egregious misconduct, from directing its counterintelligence and law-enforcement powers against its political opposition?

That norm was flouted by the Justice Department and the FBI, under the direction of the Obama administration’s senior political leadership. Representative Gowdy, Senator Rubio, and General Clapper maintain that the Justice Department and the FBI were just doing what we should expect them to do, and that we should applaud them. But this claim is based on the easily refuted fiction that the Justice Department and FBI were not investigating the Trump campaign. The claim also ignores the stubborn fact that, if all the Obama administration had been trying to do was check out a few bad apples with suspicious Russia ties, this could easily have been done by alerting the Trump campaign and asking for its help.

Instead, Obama officials made the Trump campaign the subject of a counterintelligence investigation.

What triggered strong criticism of the FBI?

It comes after the Federal Bureau of Investigation admitted it did not properly follow up on a warning about Mr Cruz.

Mitch McConnell .
McConnell , speaking on the Senate floor Wednesday evening , said senators would have plenty of time to view the report . He also filed a cloture motion that paves the way for a procedural vote on Kavanaugh 's nomination on Friday and a final up-or-down vote on confirmation as early as Saturday .
`` This evening , the Senate will receive the results of the FBI ’ s supplemental background investigation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh , '' McConnell said on the floor . `` This is now the seventh time the FBI has looked into Judge Kavanaugh ’ s background . And this information comes on top of what has already been one of the most thorough and most exhaustive Senate reviews of any Supreme Court nominee in the entire history of our country . ''
Much of Wednesday was a waiting game as senators prepared for the report and for its aftermath . The document could be a deciding factor for three Republican senators who hold swing votes on Kavanaugh 's appointment since conservatives hold a thin 51-49 majority .
The report , which is planned to be kept secret , is expected to center around accusations of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh when he was young .
The report was to be given to the White House then is expected to be shipped to Capitol Hill .
`` As Leader McConnell stated , the FBI ’ s supplemental background investigation will be transmitted to the Senate tonight , '' said White House spokesman Raj Shah .
The FBI concluding the investigation is all but certain to be criticized . Christine Blasey Ford , who alleged Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teens , was not contacted or interviewed by the FBI during its investigation as of late Wednesday . Nor has another woman , Julie Swetnick , who was the third to accuse Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct .
Ford 's lawyers released a statement late Wednesday night condemning the investigation being done without Ford 's participation .
`` We are profoundly disappointed that after the tremendous sacrifice she made in coming forward , those directing the FBI investigation were not interested in seeking the truth , '' the statement from Ford 's attorneys reads .
The FBI had contacted at least handful of key witnesses in its investigation but some questioned why others were not interviewed .
The report is expected to center on allegations posed by Ford . She testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her while they were in high school . Kavanaugh vehemently denied the allegations .
Sen. Dianne Feinstein , the Democratic leader on the Senate Judiciary Committee , said the FBI 's investigation would n't be deemed credible without testimony from both Ford and Kavanaugh amid reports they might not be interviewed .
`` Last week ’ s hearing is no substitute for FBI interviews , especially when you consider the tenor of Judge Kavanaugh ’ s testimony , '' Feinstein said in a statement . `` We have asked repeatedly for the White House to provide us with the scope of the investigation and what restrictions they placed on the FBI . The White House continues to refuse to answer . It ’ s completely unacceptable to hide this information from the Senate and the public . ''
Early Wednesday , she and other Democrats didn ’ t seem to have much information about the FBI report and how it would be rolled out .
Feinstein said she expected to see the report on Thursday but “ that ’ s just my estimation . I don ’ t know . ”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y. , called for a slowdown in the process , suggesting senators should have a day to study the FBI report before deciding Kavanaugh 's fate .
`` A Supreme Court nominee must , whatever their politics , be a shining example of someone who tells the truth , '' Schumer tweeted . `` Every Senator now must assess these serious allegations , and consider whether Judge Kavanaugh has the temperament , independence , and credibility to serve . ''
Sen. Susan Collins , R-Maine , and Sen. Lisa Murkowski , R-Alaska , whose votes are considered key to the nomination , both said they were satisfied with the pace of the process .
McConnell said Tuesday that the report would be finished quickly enough to allow a Senate vote this week .
`` We ’ ll have an FBI report this week , and we ’ ll have a vote this week , '' McConnell , R-Ky. , told reporters .
McConnell noted that only senators would be able to see the report . He did not say how long he 'd wait to schedule a vote after the report was released , but a full vote on Kavanaugh could happen as early as Saturday afternoon if the Senate is ordered to work over the weekend .
President Donald Trump said he expects there to be a vote by week 's end .
`` And I think the process – I must say , I think – hopefully , as Mitch said , they 'll have a vote by the end of the week , and it will be a positive vote . But it will be dependent on what comes back from the FBI , '' Trump said Tuesday . `` The FBI – the FBI is working . They 're working very hard . And let 's see what happens . ''
The Justice Department referred questions about the probe back to the White House .

The FBI's supplemental background check into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh has apparently wrapped up and the Senate will receive the results Wednesday evening, according to Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell.

McConnell, speaking on the Senate floor Wednesday evening, said senators would have plenty of time to view the report. He also filed a cloture motion that paves the way for a procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination on Friday and a final up-or-down vote on confirmation as early as Saturday.

""This evening, the Senate will receive the results of the FBI’s supplemental background investigation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh,"" McConnell said on the floor. ""This is now the seventh time the FBI has looked into Judge Kavanaugh’s background. And this information comes on top of what has already been one of the most thorough and most exhaustive Senate reviews of any Supreme Court nominee in the entire history of our country.""

Much of Wednesday was a waiting game as senators prepared for the report and for its aftermath. The document could be a deciding factor for three Republican senators who hold swing votes on Kavanaugh's appointment since conservatives hold a thin 51-49 majority.

The report, which is planned to be kept secret, is expected to center around accusations of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh when he was young.

The report was to be given to the White House then is expected to be shipped to Capitol Hill.

""As Leader McConnell stated, the FBI’s supplemental background investigation will be transmitted to the Senate tonight,"" said White House spokesman Raj Shah.

The FBI concluding the investigation is all but certain to be criticized. Christine Blasey Ford, who alleged Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teens, was not contacted or interviewed by the FBI during its investigation as of late Wednesday. Nor has another woman, Julie Swetnick, who was the third to accuse Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.

Ford's lawyers released a statement late Wednesday night condemning the investigation being done without Ford's participation.

""We are profoundly disappointed that after the tremendous sacrifice she made in coming forward, those directing the FBI investigation were not interested in seeking the truth,"" the statement from Ford's attorneys reads.

The FBI had contacted at least handful of key witnesses in its investigation but some questioned why others were not interviewed.

The report is expected to center on allegations posed by Ford. She testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her while they were in high school. Kavanaugh vehemently denied the allegations.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic leader on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the FBI's investigation wouldn't be deemed credible without testimony from both Ford and Kavanaugh amid reports they might not be interviewed.

""Last week’s hearing is no substitute for FBI interviews, especially when you consider the tenor of Judge Kavanaugh’s testimony,"" Feinstein said in a statement. ""We have asked repeatedly for the White House to provide us with the scope of the investigation and what restrictions they placed on the FBI. The White House continues to refuse to answer. It’s completely unacceptable to hide this information from the Senate and the public.""

Early Wednesday, she and other Democrats didn’t seem to have much information about the FBI report and how it would be rolled out.

Feinstein said she expected to see the report on Thursday but “that’s just my estimation. I don’t know.”

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called for a slowdown in the process, suggesting senators should have a day to study the FBI report before deciding Kavanaugh's fate.

""A Supreme Court nominee must, whatever their politics, be a shining example of someone who tells the truth,"" Schumer tweeted. ""Every Senator now must assess these serious allegations, and consider whether Judge Kavanaugh has the temperament, independence, and credibility to serve.""

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, whose votes are considered key to the nomination, both said they were satisfied with the pace of the process.

McConnell said Tuesday that the report would be finished quickly enough to allow a Senate vote this week.

""We’ll have an FBI report this week, and we’ll have a vote this week,"" McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters.

McConnell noted that only senators would be able to see the report. He did not say how long he'd wait to schedule a vote after the report was released, but a full vote on Kavanaugh could happen as early as Saturday afternoon if the Senate is ordered to work over the weekend.

President Donald Trump said he expects there to be a vote by week's end.

""And I think the process – I must say, I think – hopefully, as Mitch said, they'll have a vote by the end of the week, and it will be a positive vote. But it will be dependent on what comes back from the FBI,"" Trump said Tuesday. ""The FBI – the FBI is working. They're working very hard. And let's see what happens.""

The Justice Department referred questions about the probe back to the White House.

Leland Keyser , who Dr. Ford has said was present at the gathering where she was allegedly assaulted in the 1980s , told investigators that Monica McLean , a retired Federal Bureau of Investigation agent and a friend of Dr. Ford ’ s , had urged her to clarify her statement , the people said .
The statement to the FBI offers a glimpse into how Dr. Ford ’ s allies were working behind the scenes to lobby old classmates to bolster their versions of the alleged incident , as were Judge Kavanaugh ’ s .
Judge Kavanaugh , whose Supreme Court nomination will be debated in the Senate Friday , has denied the allegations of sexual misconduct .
On Thursday , a day after sending to the White House the report on its investigation into the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh , the FBI sent the White House and Senate an additional package of information that included text messages from Ms. McLean to Ms. Keyser , according to a person familiar with the matter .
Ms. McLean ’ s lawyer , David Laufman , said in a statement : “ Any notion or claim that Ms. McLean pressured Leland Keyser to alter Ms. Keyser ’ s account of what she recalled concerning the alleged incident between Dr. Ford and Brett Kavanaugh is absolutely false . ”
Ms. Keyser ’ s lawyer on Sept. 23 said in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee that she had no recollection of attending a party with Judge Kavanaugh , whom she said she didn ’ t know . That same day , however , she told the Washington Post that she believed Dr. Ford .

Leland Keyser, who Dr. Ford has said was present at the gathering where she was allegedly assaulted in the 1980s, told investigators that Monica McLean, a retired Federal Bureau of Investigation agent and a friend of Dr. Ford’s, had urged her to clarify her statement, the people said.

The statement to the FBI offers a glimpse into how Dr. Ford’s allies were working behind the scenes to lobby old classmates to bolster their versions of the alleged incident, as were Judge Kavanaugh’s.

Judge Kavanaugh, whose Supreme Court nomination will be debated in the Senate Friday, has denied the allegations of sexual misconduct.

On Thursday, a day after sending to the White House the report on its investigation into the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh, the FBI sent the White House and Senate an additional package of information that included text messages from Ms. McLean to Ms. Keyser, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Ms. McLean’s lawyer, David Laufman, said in a statement: “Any notion or claim that Ms. McLean pressured Leland Keyser to alter Ms. Keyser’s account of what she recalled concerning the alleged incident between Dr. Ford and Brett Kavanaugh is absolutely false.”

Ms. Keyser’s lawyer on Sept. 23 said in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee that she had no recollection of attending a party with Judge Kavanaugh, whom she said she didn’t know. That same day, however, she told the Washington Post that she believed Dr. Ford. On Sept. 29, two days after Dr. Ford and the judge testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Ms. Keyser’s attorney sent a letter to the panel saying his client wasn’t refuting Dr. Ford’s account and that she believed it but couldn’t corroborate it.

Bob Corker (R., Tenn.), who has said he would vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh, told reporters earlier Thursday that he found the most significant interviews in the FBI report to be those from people close to Dr. Ford who wanted to corroborate her account and were “sympathetic in wishing they could, but they could not.”

The FBI declined to comment on the investigation.

There is no indication Dr. Ford and her legal team were involved in any effort to discuss Ms. Keyser’s statement with her, according to people familiar with the matter.

But that was always a somewhat shaky legal argument . As I noted in my Jan. 12 , 2017 , column , which first disclosed Flynn ’ s call , the Logan Act has never been criminally enforced .
I wrote on Feb. 11 , two days before he resigned : “ Michael Flynn ’ s real problem isn ’ t the Logan Act , an obscure and probably unenforceable 1799 statute that bars private meddling in foreign policy disputes .

There was always a deeper problem , one that still isn ’ t resolved . Why was the Trump administration so eager to blunt the punishment Obama gave to Russia for what we now know was gross interference in our presidential election ? In his Dec. 29 expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats , Obama was trying to impose costs on an adversary . The evidence shows that Flynn wanted to reassure this same adversary and to avoid confrontation .
How do we know that was Flynn ’ s intention ? Because he said so in his Nov. 30 , 2017 , guilty plea admitting he had made false statements about his conversations with Kislyak . The “ statement of the offense ” that accompanied the agreement states that on Dec. 29 , 2016 , after discussions with another transition team official , Flynn “ called the Russian Ambassador and requested that Russia not escalate the situation and only respond to the U.S. Sanctions in a reciprocal manner . ”

Why does this matter ? Because the issue Flynn was discussing with Kislyak was so serious . Russia had secretly subverted our democratic elections . Obama , who had delayed sanctions far too long , finally took action with the Dec. 29 expulsions . He did so on behalf of the nation , whose election system had been attacked .
The intelligence community had first disclosed Russia ’ s meddling on Oct. 7 , 2016 , in a statement that charged that “ Russia ’ s senior-most officials ” had conducted a cyberattack “ intended to interfere with the US election process . ”

We know the FBI made some serious mistakes in the Russia investigation . The misstatements and omissions by FBI officials in their applications for surveillance of Trump campaign aide Carter Page were egregious . The recent disclosures about how they prepared to question Flynn in 2017 should trouble anyone who worries about abuse of power by federal investigators seeking damning information from a suspect .
But none of that addresses the fundamental question that got this story rolling in the first place : Why was the incoming national security adviser telling the Kremlin ’ s man in Washington not to worry about the expulsion of 35 of his spies , because when the new administration took office , “ we ’ ll review everything ” ?
That was the wrong message to be sending in December 2016 .

Was Flynn improperly tricked in his Jan. 24, 2017, interview with the FBI into misstating what he had told Kislyak? If so, why did he resign and later plead guilty?

In Flynn’s Feb. 13, 2017, resignation letter, he admitted that he had made misleading statements to Vice President Pence about the Kislyak call. Here’s how he put it: “Because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information regarding phone calls with the Russian ambassador.” That’s not the FBI talking, it’s Flynn.

Obama, who had delayed sanctions far too long, finally took action with the Dec. 29 expulsions. He did so on behalf of the nation, whose election system had been attacked.

The intelligence community had first disclosed Russia’s meddling on Oct. 7, 2016, in a statement that charged that “Russia’s senior-most officials” had conducted a cyberattack “intended to interfere with the US election process.”

That initial damning assessment was amplified in a Jan. 6, 2017, report, in which the intelligence community said Russia had tried to “denigrate” the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, and “harm her electability and potential presidency” and that Moscow had a “clear preference” for Trump.

The Senate Intelligence Committee, led by a Republican, spent the past three years investigating whether our spy chiefs’ finding was correct. Its judgment: “The committee found no reason to dispute the intelligence community’s conclusions.”

We know the FBI made some serious mistakes in the Russia investigation. The misstatements and omissions by FBI officials in their applications for surveillance of Trump campaign aide Carter Page were egregious. The recent disclosures about how they prepared to question Flynn in 2017 should trouble anyone who worries about abuse of power by federal investigators seeking damning information from a suspect.

But none of that addresses the fundamental question that got this story rolling in the first place: Why was the incoming national security adviser telling the Kremlin’s man in Washington not to worry about the expulsion of 35 of his spies, because when the new administration took office, “we’ll review everything”?

Williamson, John Fund, Andrew C. Mccarthy, Allen C. Guelzo, Kyle Smith, Jim Geraghty","Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn departs U.S. District Court in Washington , D.C. , December 1 , 2017 . ( Jonathan Ernst/Reuters )
The Flynn case should never have been brought and was properly disposed of .
Judgments and rules are two different things . Rules are , or should be , clear bright lines that can produce yes-or-no answers . Judgments are more complicated than that . They need not be as standardless as Potter Stewart ’ s famous definition of pornography ( “ I know it when I see it ” ) , but judgments typically involve a good deal more weighing and balancing of multiple factors , sometimes in ways that don ’ t reduce to a mathematical formula . The Justice Department ’ s decision to drop the Michael Flynn false-statement prosecution , three years after he pleaded guilty , might not pass muster as a rules-based decision , which is why Flynn faced an uphill battle trying to convince a court to vacate his plea . But as a judgment , it was the right one .
To start with , remember prosecutorial discretion . It is attractive as a rhetorical strategy to pretend that all violations of the law should be , and normally are , always prosecuted . In the real world , however , that is not how it works . Judgments are always made : about the strength of the evidence , the strength of the legal arguments , the seriousness of the actual crime , the nature of the offender , and the resources needed to pursue the case . These are not judgments that should be made without standards , or they become arbitrary at best , discriminatory at worst . But if your argument in the Flynn case is simply “ he should be prosecuted if the law allows it , ” you ’ re not dealing seriously with the world as it is .
That is especially so given the Justice Department ’ s refusal to prosecute former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe , who was found by the DOJ inspector general to have lied to investigators ; or President Obama ’ s director of national intelligence James Clapper , who lied under oath to the Senate about warrantless surveillance ; or Obama ’ s CIA director John Brennan , who lied under oath about CIA drone strikes and spying on Congress ; or , for that matter , Democratic National Committee chair Thomas Perez , who was reprimanded by Congress for multiple lies and concealment while serving as assistant attorney general for civil rights . We ’ re a long way here from “ let justice be done , though the heavens fall . ”
Flynn , of course , has already been charged and pleaded guilty . The decision to allow him to withdraw his plea and walk away is harder than a decision not to prosecute in the first place . His admission of guilt is itself a sworn statement to a court ( albeit one that most likely would not be admissible evidence in a future prosecution ) . The decision is , however , still an exercise of the kind of judgment that prosecutors are expected to apply throughout the life of a criminal case .
To understand why abandoning the Flynn prosecution was the right move , consider not a single factor but six factors taken together :
First , Flynn was prosecuted only for a process crime : lying to the FBI about his conversation with the Russian ambassador . He was not charged with any underlying wrongdoing regarding Russia . His crime would never even have happened if the FBI had not chosen to interview him . Now , I do not take the rules-based view that we should never prosecute process crimes such as perjury , obstruction , or lies to investigators without an underlying crime . The rules protecting judicial proceedings ( trials , grand juries , civil depositions ) and warrant applications are especially important , since false testimony there has a legal effect . Nor do I argue that we should entirely abolish lying to federal investigators as a criminal offense ( though some rules-based reforms of the statute are overdue ) . Sometimes , we need to prosecute lies and obstruction precisely because they prevent a crime from being discovered or proven . Still , there is undoubtedly more room for exercising judgment when dealing with a solely process-based crime , and everyone knows that such cases are often not pursued when they could be .
Second , Flynn ’ s false statements were completely victimless . The FBI agents he lied to already knew the truth about his conversation with the Russian ambassador ; they had him on tape . No neutral judge or jury was misled . No facts were effectively concealed . No inquiry was impeded . As a matter of rules , the legal requirement that lies be material to an investigation can arguably be met in those circumstances : The materiality standard is about what information would affect an investigation , not whether it actually did . As a matter of rules , Flynn would not meet the high test for entrapment , or for a “ perjury trap , ” even if you applied that doctrine to a lies-to-investigators case . But again , when you move from rules to judgments , this is the most marginal of lies , in a situation created by the investigators .
Third , misconduct in investigating and prosecuting a case matters more when the investigators and prosecutors are the only “ victims ” in the first place . Misconduct plainly happened here , in failing to turn over exculpatory information to Flynn ’ s defense . More broadly , the investigation was conducted as a sting operation against a target who was not under legitimate suspicion of any prosecutable crime . This is not a case where dropping the prosecution because “ the constable blundered ” would be unjust to a victim of violence , theft , or fraud . If you ’ re going to base a prosecution entirely on the integrity of the process , you can not very well hand-wave away your own violations of the integrity of the process .
Fourth , the FBI didn ’ t initiate an investigation of Flynn because it reasonably suspected a crime . Flynn was originally investigated as part of a national-security investigation , in which less rigorous standards are involved because , ordinarily , such investigations never go public . That is how the FBI got to listen to his call with the Russian ambassador . That investigation , at least as far as Flynn was concerned , had wound down by the time he was interviewed . There ’ s a reason for that : National-security investigations exist , ultimately , to inform decisions by the president . The circumstances of his interview rather clearly suggest that the FBI talked to Flynn not because the agents thought that President Trump should know what his national-security adviser had been up to , but precisely because they were worried that Trump approved of it . That ’ s his responsibility , not theirs .
Fifth , there is a grave issue of selective enforcement of the law behind the Flynn interview . The pretext for keeping the Flynn investigation open long enough to interview him was that he might have violated the Logan Act . As I have explained before , however , the Logan Act has been on the books since 1799 without a single conviction ; nobody has even been indicted under it since 1852 , and not for a lack of publicly notorious violations . Moreover , if you were going to test the enforceability after all these years of the Logan Act ’ s ban on talking to foreign governments “ without authority of the United States , ” the worst possible test case would be against a member of the national-security team of an incoming presidential administration , over conversations held during the presidential transition period . The people who interviewed Flynn knew perfectly well that they did not have a snowball ’ s chance in hell of successfully prosecuting him under the Logan Act .
Sixth , the Flynn investigation was political . Investigating a top national-security official for a foreign-policy call is inherently political . The broader context of the investigation was drenched in politics . Even on the most harmless interpretation of the recently revealed notes discussing the interview , it is clear that the FBI investigators were well aware that they were treading on politically sensitive turf where they might well have more success in getting Flynn fired from the White House ( as they did ) than in building a legal case . The political nature of an investigation is not a defense to crime . But it is surely a reason for Attorney General Barr — whose decision was also unavoidably political — to conclude that there was no outcome in the Flynn case that could be characterized as upholding the law without fear or favor .
No one of these six factors demands dismissal of the Flynn false statement case . But all six of them together represent a perfect storm of overreach .
General Flynn does not walk away from this an exonerated man , nor should he , as David French has detailed at greater length . He is not , in fact , an innocent man . He lied to the FBI and admitted doing so . He lied to the vice president , for which he was properly fired . I am glad that Flynn is out of government .
Flynn also admitted in his plea to filing false Foreign Agent Registration Act disclosure forms concealing his work with the Turkish government . He was never charged under FARA , and there are competing theories as to why Flynn pleaded guilty only to the false-statement charge . I leave to others the question of the strength of the FARA charge and whether it would have been unfair to pursue one , given that FARA itself had not previously been enforced very vigorously . If the Justice Department had the goods to prosecute Flynn ( or his son ) for FARA disclosure violations , it should have done so years ago . It would have been quite late in the day for the Justice Department to switch theories and restart this case now solely as a FARA prosecution .
In either event , Flynn ’ s false-statement prosecution simply pushed the envelope to its limits in too many directions at once , and Bill Barr did the right thing in ending it . That is true whether or not you like or trust Barr , Flynn , or Trump .
As to rules , I have argued for years that we should not seek to impose vague , complex , or elastic laws against our political enemies if we do not want them used against our friends . The Flynn prosecution should prompt a rethinking of some of our rules to ensure that others — be they Democrats or ordinary people far less prominent than General Flynn — are not similarly targeted . That should start with repealing the absurd and constitutionally dubious Logan Act , but it shouldn ’ t end there . The false-statements law , section 1001 , should also come under review by Congress ; as then-Judge Kavanaugh wrote a decade ago , of the “ ever-metastasizing §1001 ” :
As many others have noted , §1001 prosecutions can pose a risk of abuse and injustice . In part , that ’ s because §1001 applies to virtually any statement an individual makes to virtually any federal government official—even when the individual making the statement is not under oath ( unlike in perjury cases ) or otherwise aware that criminal punishment can result from a false statement .
There is also a case to be made for clearer boundaries regarding the difference between national-security and criminal investigations , especially when conducting politically sensitive investigations of government officials — although we should be wary of reconstructing the artificial separations that obstructed sharing of information about terrorism in the run-up to 9/11 . Finally , as I have argued before , we should restructure the process for investigating government officials by establishing a cabinet-level Inspector General outside of the Justice Department .
Reforms of this nature would be forward-looking , and ideally would reduce the need to depend solely upon prosecutorial judgment to avoid injustice and abuse . But in applying that judgment , the Flynn case should never have been brought , and was properly disposed of .","Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn departs U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., December 1, 2017.

McCabe suggested in his statement that he was trying to ""set the record straight"" about the FBI's independence against the background of those allegations.

With the FBI disciplinarians recommending the firing, Justice Department leaders were in a difficult situation. Sessions, whose job status has for months appeared shaky under his own blistering criticism from Trump, risked inflaming the White House if he decided against firing McCabe.

But a decision to dismiss McCabe days before his retirement nonetheless carried the risk of angering his rank-and-file supporters at the FBI.

McCabe became entangled in presidential politics in 2016 when it was revealed that his wife, during her unsuccessful legislative run, received campaign contributions from the political action committee of then-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a longtime Clinton friend.

The FBI has said McCabe received the necessary ethics approval about his wife's candidacy and was not supervising the Clinton investigation at the time.

But Trump pounded away on Twitter on Saturday: ""How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife's campaign by Crooked H friend, Terry M ... How many lies? How many leaks? Comey knew it all, and much more!""

fbi,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/20/17879284/democrats-fbi-investigation-kavanaugh,"The fight over reopening the FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh, explained",2018-09-20,"Li Zhou, Tara Golshan, Julia Belluz, Ian Millhiser, Terry Nguyen, Theodore Schleifer, Emily Stewart","Christine Blasey Ford , who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of having sexually assaulted her in high school , says she wants the FBI to independently investigate her claim before she testifies in front of the Senate . Kavanaugh denies Ford ’ s allegations .
Democratic lawmakers have been calling for an independent FBI investigation from the beginning . Senate Republicans , however , say that ’ s not possible because “ It ’ s not the FBI ’ s role to investigate a matter such as this , ” as Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley ( R-IA ) wrote in a letter to Ford ’ s lawyers on Wednesday .
Grassley argued that the FBI ’ s role in the confirmation process is merely to conduct a background check of the nominee , which the Senate then takes into account when determining whether or not to confirm the individual in question .
“ The job of assessing and investigating a nominee ’ s qualifications in order to decide whether to consent to the nomination is ours , and ours alone , ” Grassley wrote .
The Department of Justice , which oversees the FBI , also released a statement Wednesday noting that “ [ t ] he allegation does not involve any potential federal crime . ”
But Senate Democrats aren ’ t asking for a criminal investigation . They want the FBI to reopen Kavanaugh ’ s background check .
Grassley has shut that avenue down too , though . On Tuesday , Grassley told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt in no uncertain terms that the “ FBI investigation of Judge Kavanaugh is closed ” and that the “ FBI is not doing any further investigation . ”
Grassley ’ s correct — the FBI ’ s background investigation is closed . But there ’ s nothing to stop the FBI from reopening or adding to it .
In fact , in 1991 , the agency did just that , at the request of then-President George H.W . Bush , when Anita Hill made sexual harassment allegations against then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas . The FBI investigated and wrote a report that eventually led the White House to declare that Hill ’ s allegations were unfounded .
Back then , Sen. Orrin Hatch ( R-UT ) — who was and still is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee — called it “ the very right thing to do . ”
That ’ s in stark contrast to the tweet his office posted on Tuesday claiming that the “ FBI does not do investigations like this ” and that the “ responsibility falls to us . ”
So what ’ s different with the Kavanaugh case ? Nothing . Except that Republicans are adamant about getting their nominee through the process quickly — and Donald Trump doesn ’ t look like he ’ s about to ask for an FBI investigation anytime soon .
Undergoing an FBI background check is standard operating procedure for a number of federal positions , including nominees for the Supreme Court . It ’ s a review that ’ s meant to probe a nominee ’ s qualifications as well as possible security risks the person could pose to the United States .
Potential vulnerability to blackmail is one such security risk . If someone has big secrets they don ’ t want revealed to the public — like , say , having committed sexual assault 30 years ago — a foreign country or other bad actor could learn that information and use it as blackmail . Some experts say that background checks tend to focus on more recent developments , however .
Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe highlighted the possibility of blackmail in Kavanaugh ’ s case as all the more reason why the FBI should conduct a full review of the sexual assault allegations against him .
The argument that because sexual assault isn ’ t a federal crime FBI can ’ t investigate , its only role being to ensure a nominee isn ’ t a security risk , doesn ’ t work . A justice confirmed under this cloud could be blackmailed if evidence of perjury were to emerge later — Laurence Tribe ( @ tribelaw ) September 19 , 2018
As PBS NewsHour has explained , these background checks are extremely invasive probes of everything from a nominee ’ s romantic history to their credit score :
Candidates ’ taxes , writings , childhoods , business dealings , medical histories and , yes , love lives , are all scrutinized for potential red flags . “ The idea that you miss something that later torpedoed the nomination — that ’ s a nightmare , ” said Jack Quinn , former White House counsel to President Bill Clinton . Among the questions [ Anthony ] Kennedy was asked : Have you ever engaged in kinky sex ? Did you shoplift as a kid ? What about any associations with groups like the Klu Klux Klan [ sic ] ? Ever abuse a girlfriend ? Engage in cruelty to animals ? And tell us about sex in college : How often , how many women , and did you ever contract a venereal disease ?
Failed background checks have led to the downfall of many White House staffers , as well as federal nominees like Zoe Baird , whom President Bill Clinton nominated for attorney general . An FBI background check on Baird found that she was employing undocumented workers and it ultimately scuttled her nomination .
More recently , Trump ’ s ( now former ) White House staff secretary Rob Porter was also flagged during a review by the FBI , after the agency interviewed past partners who detailed allegations of domestic abuse . The White House , at the time , pleaded ignorance and said it had not received the completed results of the check .
During the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W . Bush , background checks for many federal nominees were completed prior to their announcement , according to the New York Times .
Since then , however , as administrations have sought to expedite the nomination process , these checks tend to happen later on in the process . Kavanaugh ’ s background check was completed before his September confirmation hearing , according to Judiciary Committee spokesperson Taylor Foy . Foy added that most Supreme Court nominee checks are usually finished before a confirmation hearing takes place .
As Republicans are quick to point out , Kavanaugh has already undergone six background checks for various roles he ’ s held .
But none of the past background checks on Kavanaugh appeared to include an investigation into Ford ’ s allegation of sexual assault . Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D-CA ) only submitted Ford ’ s letter detailing her experience with Kavanaugh to the FBI on September 12 , after his background check was closed .
There is precedent to add a background check to address new sexual assault allegations
The FBI confirmed last week that it added Ford ’ s letter detailing the allegations to an existing background file on Kavanaugh . But the inclusion of this letter simply means that officials at the White House and senators are now able to access it and evaluate it as part of their consideration of the nominee . It doesn ’ t mean the FBI is conducting an investigation .
On Wednesday , the DOJ released an additional statement saying that it was not the agency ’ s responsibility to weigh the “ credibility ” of allegations like the ones Ford has made , and that the “ FBI ’ s role in such matters is to provide information for the use of the decision makers . ”
But that seems to contradict actions the FBI has taken in the past in response to such allegations . The agency does not make a definitive call about how certain allegations should factor into the review of a nominee , but it has played a fact-finding role before .
In 1991 , the George H.W . Bush administration directed the FBI to gather facts after Anita Hill brought sexual harassment allegations against Clarence Thomas . In Hill ’ s case , the timeline was slightly different .
As a former colleague of Thomas ’ s , she was approached by the Senate Judiciary Committee to provide background information on Thomas before his confirmation hearings had begun . She didn ’ t bring up the harassment allegations until his hearing had already started , according to a timeline compiled by CNN .
Hill spoke to the panel about her experience with harassment a few days after Thomas ’ s hearings were underway , the New York Times reported . A few weeks later , an FBI the committee suggested performing an investigation into the allegations to Hill , she says . The White House said that it found out about her allegations around that time and directed the FBI to investigate them and add them to Thomas ’ s background check .
The agency then compiled a report about the allegations that included interviews with Hill , Thomas , and at least one witness , and submitted it to the White House . The investigation , which took place after the confirmation hearing , but before the committee vote , took three days . Based on the findings in the report , the Bush administration concluded that Hill ’ s allegations were “ unfounded . ”
A little over a week after the committee vote , NPR ’ s Nina Totenberg dropped a bombshell report exposing the confidential investigation to the public . That report spurred another public hearing specifically focused on the sexual harassment allegations , which featured testimony from Hill and Thomas . “ According to sources who ’ ve seen the FBI report , nothing in it contradicted Hill ’ s story except nominee Thomas , who denied any harassment , ” Totenberg ’ s reporting noted .
Democrats remained reluctant to delay Thomas ’ s larger Senate vote , and he went on to get confirmed 52 to 48 , just a few days after Hill testified .
Grassley ’ s office has pointed out that the FBI investigation of Hill ’ s allegations took place when they had not yet been made public . “ The purpose of the background investigation process is to compile information in a confidential manner , ” he writes . “ Because Dr. Ford ’ s allegations are in the public arena , there is no longer a need for a confidential FBI investigation . ”
Trump has not signaled any interest in opening an FBI investigation
The White House clearly has the ability to ask the FBI to reopen or add to a nominee ’ s existing background check . But so far , Trump has signaled that he isn ’ t particularly interested in doing so . In fact , he ’ s tried to shift the onus onto the FBI even though the president is traditionally the one with the ability to prompt such reviews .
“ I don ’ t think the FBI should be involved because they don ’ t want to be involved , if they wanted to be I would certainly do that , ” Trump said at a press appearance on Tuesday . “ As you say , this is not really their thing . The senators will do a good job . ”
In the Hill case , both the majority and minority leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the White House pushed for the FBI to create a report in response to Hill ’ s allegations .
This time around , though , only the Democrats are pushing for the same thing .
Throughout Kavanaugh ’ s entire confirmation process — well before the allegations of sexual assault emerged — Democrats have argued that Republicans are rushing to confirm the judge without giving the Democrats on the committee enough time to examine his record . They say that Republicans have unilaterally handled his vetting and obscured parts of his lengthy paper trail .
Now , Democrats are arguing that Republicans are once again rushing to vote on Kavanaugh ’ s confirmation before Ford ’ s allegations have been thoroughly and impartially investigated . And they ’ re calling on federal investigators to review the allegations and submit a report to the Senate Judiciary Committee before a hearing or vote takes place .
“ A proper investigation must be completed , witnesses interviewed , evidence reviewed and all sides spoken to , ” Feinstein said in a statement Wednesday . “ Only then should the chairman set a hearing date . ”
But Republicans are pushing back , insisting that no FBI investigation is needed and that the Democrats are merely trying to stall the vote . Instead , they ’ ve invited both Ford and Kavanaugh to testify publicly before the committee and address the allegations that way .
Ford previously said she would be open to testifying . On Tuesday , however , Ford ’ s lawyers sent a letter to Grassley saying Ford wants the FBI to investigate the alleged incident before she appears in front of the Senate .
Republicans are now saying that if she doesn ’ t testify Monday , they will proceed with the vote . Democrats don ’ t have much recourse if that happens .
All of this is occurring against the backdrop of the upcoming midterm elections
Republicans have long maintained that they ’ d like to get Kavanaugh ’ s confirmation squared away by early October , November at the latest . Democrats could stand to benefit if the vote does end up stalling .
If a vote takes place closer to the November 6 midterm elections , for example , Democrats could echo the arguments Republicans made to stymie Obama-era Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland and claim that voters deserve to be heard before the Supreme Court vote takes place .
( Democrats ’ wariness toward Grassley ’ s approach comes after Republicans blocked Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland from getting a Supreme Court hearing and changed Senate rules to confirm Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Court . )
There ’ s also a slim possibility that Democrats could win back control of the Senate in the midterm elections . That wouldn ’ t immediately change things , but would give them significantly more leverage over judicial nominees in the future .
An FBI investigation and report doesn ’ t guarantee that the Senate would interpret its findings as vindicating Ford . After all , the Bush White House didn ’ t see its FBI report as vindicating Hill .
That seems to be a risk Ford is willing to take .
“ While no sexual assault survivor should be subjected to such an ordeal , Dr. Ford wants to cooperate with the Committee and with law enforcement officials , ” Ford ’ s lawyer wrote in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee . “ As the Judiciary Committee has recognized and done before , an FBI investigation of the incident should be the first step in addressing the allegations . ”","Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of having sexually assaulted her in high school, says she wants the FBI to independently investigate her claim before she testifies in front of the Senate. Kavanaugh denies Ford’s allegations.

The FBI background check, briefly explained

Undergoing an FBI background check is standard operating procedure for a number of federal positions, including nominees for the Supreme Court. It’s a review that’s meant to probe a nominee’s qualifications as well as possible security risks the person could pose to the United States.

Potential vulnerability to blackmail is one such security risk.

fbi,ABC News,0,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fbi-agent-peter-strzok-claims-government-violated-privacy/story?id=68001195,"Former FBI agent Peter Strzok claims government violated his privacy, free speech rights",,Luke Barr,"Former FBI agent Peter Strzok claims government violated his privacy , free speech rights He argues the Justice Department improperly released his text messages .
Former FBI agent Peter Strzok is claiming the government violated his First Amendment rights by releasing his private text messages that contained his political opinion about President Donald Trump .
In a new court filing Monday , Strzok and his attorneys argue that the Justice Department violated his protected free speech by releasing the text messages he exchanged with then-FBI lawyer Lisa Page .
Trump is “ not ever going to become president , right ? Right ? ! ” Page wrote in one text . “ No . No he won ’ t , ” Strzok responded . “ We ’ ll stop it. ” He also called Trump an `` idiot . ''
Strozk , citing what appears to be a private exchange between him and Page , claims that the FBI fired him because he expressed his political beliefs .
Justice Department lawyers argue that it wasn ’ t the political speech that he was fired for , but because Page and Strozk used their work phones .
Strozk claims others who made similar political remarks , but in favor of President Trump , were not punished .
“ This disparate and discriminatory treatment is but one example of a broader pattern , '' his suit says . `` Throughout the Trump Administration , there has been a pattern of treating political speech by federal employees differently based on its content . While Plaintiff and many others who have criticized the President have faced discipline , up to and including termination , revocation of security clearances , and threats of criminal prosecution , federal employees who praise President Trump and/or attack his political rivals have faced no consequences . ”
Strozk originally sued DOJ in August , claiming that the FBI and DOJ unlawfully disclosed his private text messages that disparaged Trump before and after the 2016 presidential election -- including the time frame during which Strzok helped lead the agency 's investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's private email server and Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election .
Then-FBI Deputy Assistant Director Peter Strzok testifies on Capitol Hill , July 12 , 2018 , in Washington . Evan Vucci/AP , FILE
President Trump has made Strzok a frequent target , citing those disparaging texts , and has repeatedly argued that Strzok 's political bias tainted the early stages of the Russia investigation .
Strzok 's claims of privacy and free speech violations mirror those made in a lawsuit filed by Page .
Page sued the FBI and DOJ earlier this year , alleging her privacy was violated by the release of texts she exchanged with Strzok .

She contends that , after the disclosure of the text messages , she was targeted by President Trump and his allies .
Both claim that DOJ violated the Privacy Act by releasing the text messages to the press .
“ Upon information and belief , the disclosures to the media were intended to discredit the Mueller investigation , engender public distrust of the FBI and the intelligence community , and otherwise serve the partisan political agenda of President Trump and his political allies , ” Strzok ’ s recent court filing says .
Former DOJ spokesperson Sarah Isagur Flores refuted the claim that DOJ mislead Congress and didn ’ t conduct a “ thoughtful review ” from career officials .
`` As the DAG said , after initial inquiries from Congress , the DAG consulted with the IG , and the IG determined that he had no objection to the Department providing the material to the Congressional committees that had requested it ( discussion w IG was only about Congress ) , '' she tweeted in December 2017 .

Former FBI agent Peter Strzok is claiming the government violated his First Amendment rights by releasing his private text messages that contained his political opinion about President Donald Trump.

In a new court filing Monday, Strzok and his attorneys argue that the Justice Department violated his protected free speech by releasing the text messages he exchanged with then-FBI lawyer Lisa Page.

Trump is “not ever going to become president, right? Right?!” Page wrote in one text. “No. No he won’t,” Strzok responded. “We’ll stop it.” He also called Trump an ""idiot.""

Strozk, citing what appears to be a private exchange between him and Page, claims that the FBI fired him because he expressed his political beliefs.

Justice Department lawyers argue that it wasn’t the political speech that he was fired for, but because Page and Strozk used their work phones.

Strozk claims others who made similar political remarks, but in favor of President Trump, were not punished.

“This disparate and discriminatory treatment is but one example of a broader pattern,"" his suit says. ""Throughout the Trump Administration, there has been a pattern of treating political speech by federal employees differently based on its content. While Plaintiff and many others who have criticized the President have faced discipline, up to and including termination, revocation of security clearances, and threats of criminal prosecution, federal employees who praise President Trump and/or attack his political rivals have faced no consequences.”

Strozk originally sued DOJ in August, claiming that the FBI and DOJ unlawfully disclosed his private text messages that disparaged Trump before and after the 2016 presidential election -- including the time frame during which Strzok helped lead the agency's investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private email server and Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

President Trump has made Strzok a frequent target, citing those disparaging texts, and has repeatedly argued that Strzok's political bias tainted the early stages of the Russia investigation.

Strzok's claims of privacy and free speech violations mirror those made in a lawsuit filed by Page.

Page sued the FBI and DOJ earlier this year, alleging her privacy was violated by the release of texts she exchanged with Strzok.

She contends that, after the disclosure of the text messages, she was targeted by President Trump and his allies.

Both claim that DOJ violated the Privacy Act by releasing the text messages to the press.

“Upon information and belief, the disclosures to the media were intended to discredit the Mueller investigation, engender public distrust of the FBI and the intelligence community, and otherwise serve the partisan political agenda of President Trump and his political allies,” Strzok’s recent court filing says.

Former DOJ spokesperson Sarah Isagur Flores refuted the claim that DOJ mislead Congress and didn’t conduct a “thoughtful review” from career officials.

""As the DAG said, after initial inquiries from Congress, the DAG consulted with the IG, and the IG determined that he had no objection to the Department providing the material to the Congressional committees that had requested it (discussion w IG was only about Congress),"" she tweeted in December 2017.

""After that consultation, senior career ethics advisors determined that there were no legal or ethical concerns, including under the Privacy Act, that prohibited the release of the information to the public either by members of Congress or by the Department,"" Flores said.

In the new court filing, Strozk also takes issue with the process by which he was terminated.

“Plaintiff also expressed deep concerns with the lack of due process in his disciplinary process, citing the following facts: repeated public and private statements by President Trump demanding that Plaintiff be fired; Plaintiff’s inability to access his own files or the thousands of pages of materials relied upon by OPR (Office of Professional Responsibility); and “the unusual and unprecedented speed of OPR’s process,” evidenced by the fact that OPR’s letter to Plaintiff still contained language keyed to a prior version of the OIG report that had been changed in the final report, which suggested “a rush to judgment which undermines [Plaintiff’s] right to due process.”

The FBI and DOJ have been burying the investigators ’ questionable judgments and information helpful to Flynn .
Cute how this works : Kick off the week with some “ the Department of Justice is not going to be extorted ” bombast from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , by which he rationalizes that his defiance of subpoenas and slow-walking document production to Congress — which is probing investigative irregularities related to the 2016 campaign — is required by DOJ policy and “ the rule of law. ” Then end the week with the Friday-night bad-news dump : the grudging removal of DOJ and FBI redactions from a House Intelligence Committee report on Russia ’ s election meddling .

They tell us that their lack of transparency is necessary for the protection of national security , vital intelligence , and investigative operations . But what we find out is that they were concealing their own questionable judgments and conflicting explanations for their actions ; their use of foreign-intelligence and criminal-investigative authorities to investigate Michael Flynn , Trump ’ s top campaign supporter and former national-security adviser ; and their explicitly stated belief that Flynn did not lie in the FBI interview for which Special Counsel Robert Mueller has since prosecuted him on false-statements charges .
It is simply ridiculous for President Trump to continue bloviating about this situation on Twitter and in friendly media interviews , and for congressional Republicans to continue pretending that the problem is Justice Department and FBI leadership — as if Trump were not responsible for his own administration ’ s actions . The president has not only the authority but the duty to ensure that his subordinates honor lawful disclosure requests from Congress .
A little over a week ago , the House committee chaired by Representative Devin Nunes ( R. , Calif. ) published its lengthy report on Russia ’ s interference in the 2016 election . The report was actually completed weeks earlier but was withheld while the committee battled to disclose information that the Justice Department and FBI insisted on blacking out .

No , it wouldn ’ t , countered Chairmen Nunes and other Republicans who knew what had been redacted .
When the Comey memos were finally disclosed , we learned that there was no investigative or national-security reason to have concealed them .
This has become a depressingly familiar dance . Justice and the Bureau previously insisted that the sky would fall if Congress forced the release of an Intelligence Committee report on government abuse of foreign-intelligence surveillance powers . To the contrary , we learned that the FBI and DOJ had used the unverified Steele dossier to obtain surveillance warrants on at least one person tied to the Trump campaign , in contravention of express guidelines that “ only documented and verified information may be used to support FBI applications to the [ FISA ] court ” ( see Nunes ’ s March 1 letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions ) . In addition , we learned that the FISA court was not told that the dossier was a Clinton campaign opposition-research project , and that its author , Christopher Steele , had been terminated as an informant for lying to the FBI about his contacts with the media .
More recently , the FBI severely restricted access to former FBI director James Comey ’ s memos of his meetings with President Trump . Finally , three congressional committees protested that there was no legal basis for such restriction . When the memos were finally disclosed , we learned that there was no investigative or national-security reason to have concealed them . They did , however , provide greater insight about such matters as how a briefing of then-president-elect Trump on a salacious sliver of the dossier ( but not on its sensational allegations of a traitorous conspiracy with the Kremlin ) led to an intelligence-community leak about the briefing and the consequent media publication of the dossier — the backbone of the media-Democratic “ collusion with Russia ” narrative . ( See Mollie Hemingway ’ s analysis at The Federalist . )
That leads us to last Friday ’ s disclosure of some — but not nearly all — previously redacted sections of the Intelligence Committee ’ s Russia Report .
When the House first issued its report on the Russia investigation , a heavily redacted portion ( pp . 53–54 ) related that Trump ’ s original national-security adviser , Michael Flynn , had pled guilty to a false-statements charge based on misleading statements to FBI agents about his December 2016 conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak . The report explained that Flynn had been rebuffed by Kislyak when , based on instructions from the Trump transition team , Flynn asked Russia to refrain from voting in favor of a U.N. resolution condemning Israel . Flynn also discussed with the transition team what , if anything , he should communicate to Kislyak about Trump ’ s position on the sanctions that President Obama had imposed on Russia over its interference in the 2016 election .
None of this was new information . Indeed , the committee noted that it was drawn from public court filings by Special Counsel Robert Mueller in connection with Flynn ’ s guilty plea . But there was one intriguing disclosure in the redacted report : Flynn pled guilty “ even though the [ FBI ] agents did not detect any deception during Flynn ’ s interview. ” There was no elaboration on this point — no discussion of why Flynn was interrogated by FBI agents in the first place ; no insight on deliberations within the FBI and Justice Department about whether Flynn had deceptive intent ; no explanation of how he came to be charged months later by Mueller ’ s prosecutors even though the trained investigators who observed Flynn ’ s demeanor during the interview did not believe he ’ d lied .
This news that Flynn ’ s interrogators had not sensed deception was not altogether new . It had been reported that then–FBI director James Comey had made this revelation in closed-session testimony before the committee on March 2 , 2017 . ( See my column . ) Yet , during media interviews to promote his just-released memoir , Comey — who has rebuked the House Intelligence Committee report as an effort to tear down our law-enforcement institutions — repeatedly expressed bafflement that anyone could possibly have construed his testimony to imply that the agents believed Flynn had not lied . Byron York recounts the interviews at the Washington Examiner . In one , Comey told ABC host and Clinton pal George Stephanopoulos :
I don ’ t know where that ’ s coming from . . . . That — unless I ’ m — I said something that people misunderstood , I don ’ t remember even intending to say that . So , my recollection is I never said that to anybody .
The now-unredacted passages reveal that top Obama DOJ and FBI officials provided the committee with ‘ conflicting testimony ’ about why the FBI interviewed Flynn as if he were a criminal suspect .
Well , shortly after the redactions were lifted late on Friday , The Federalist ’ s Sean Davis got busy on Twitter , posting side-by-side comparisons of the original heavily redacted pages and the new , more transparent version . The disclosures are stunning . I know this will amaze you , but it turns out the redactions had absolutely nothing to do with concerns about the need to protect national security or pending investigations . Instead , the now-unredacted passages :
Elaborate on why the FBI did not believe Flynn had lied , including quotations from Comey ’ s testimony .
Reveal that for some period of time during 2016 , the FBI conducted a counterintelligence ( CI ) investigation of Flynn .
Note that top Obama Justice Department and FBI officials provided the committee with “ conflicting testimony ” about why the FBI interviewed Flynn as if he were a criminal suspect .
Illustrate that the FBI and Justice Department originally insisted on concealment of facts helpful to Flynn that are already public .
The now-unredacted passages relate that , for some period of time during 2016 , the FBI was conducting a “ CI investigation into General Flynn. ” It was Comey ’ s recollection that he had “ authorized the closure ” of that investigation “ by late December 2016 . ”
As we have discussed in connection with Carter Page , a former Trump campaign adviser against whom the Obama Justice Department obtained FISA surveillance warrants , a CI investigation on an American citizen proceeds on the suspicion that the citizen is an agent of a foreign power whose clandestine activities violate federal criminal law . That is , it appears possible ( if not likely ) that the Justice Department was operating on the theory that Flynn — a decorated combat veteran and co-author of a 2016 book that brands Russia as an implacable enemy of the United States — was an agent of the Kremlin .
At some point , moreover , Justice rationalized the investigation into Flynn , at least in part , by relying on the Logan Act . An almost surely unconstitutional 18th-century statute , the Logan Act purports to prohibit Americans from unauthorized freelancing in foreign-policy . It has never been successfully used to prosecute anyone . ( Compare then-director Comey ’ s July 5 , 2016 , press conference and subsequent testimony , in which he theorized that charging Hillary Clinton for a rarely prosecuted classified-information offense would violate Justice Department policy against selective prosecution . )
The startling fact that there was a CI investigation of Flynn does not , of course , tell us on what evidence suspicions against him were based . As I ’ ve previously contended ( when it was not known that there was a CI investigation , but it was apparent that Flynn had been seen as a criminal suspect ) , there are profound reasons to question the legitimacy of Flynn ’ s treatment .
Notwithstanding Friday night ’ s unveiling of blacked-out passages , the report still contains redacted paragraphs about Flynn . Two of them ( on pp . 52–53 ) sandwich a passage about a business trip Flynn took to Moscow in late 2015 ( seven months before he branded Russia a committed enemy in his book ) . The trip followed a visit to Kislyak by Flynn and his son at the ambassador ’ s Washington residence .
Though not mentioned in the unredacted passage , it has been reported that Flynn was paid more than $ 45,000 by Russia ’ s state-owned propaganda network , RT , for a speech he gave while in Moscow — an event at which he sat next to President Vladimir Putin . On the current state of disclosure , we do not know how , if at all , this incident played into the decision to investigate Flynn . Neither do we know whether the FBI and Justice Department took any action when former President Bill Clinton received $ 500,000 from a Kremlin-connected bank for a short speech delivered in 2010 on a trip to Russia , during which he met with Putin — even as his wife , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , was among the U.S. officials considering and ultimately green-lighting Russia ’ s effort to acquire rights to one-fifth of America ’ s uranium stock .
The suggestion that Flynn ’ s post-election contacts with Russia were improper , let alone unlawful , is absurd . Flynn was the designated national-security adviser for the incoming administration and a key member of the Trump transition team . To have communications with officials of foreign governments was a legitimate and necessary part of his job .
It is worth noting that Flynn had been fired by Obama from his post as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and is despised by Obama intelligence officials for having become an ardent public adversary against Obama ’ s national-security policy , most prominently as candidate Trump ’ s most visible supporter . The interest of Obama ’ s DOJ and FBI in Flynn appears to have intensified after Trump won the election , when Flynn was presumed to be laying groundwork to reverse Obama ’ s positions — as Trump promised to do throughout the campaign .
While it is only natural that Obama officials would seethe over Flynn ’ s ascendancy , the suggestion that his post-election contacts with Russia were improper , let alone unlawful , is absurd . Flynn was the designated national-security adviser for the incoming administration and a key member of the Trump transition team . To have communications with officials of foreign governments was a legitimate and necessary part of his job . Plus , Kislyak was a foreign agent subject to FISA surveillance , so the FBI had recordings of his communications with Flynn and knew that Flynn had done nothing improper . ( It has been presumed that Flynn ’ s communications with Kislyak were intercepted because Kislyak , not Flynn , was the subject of a FISA warrant ; now , with confirmation that Flynn was the subject of a counterintelligence investigation , we may need to revisit that presumption . )
Whatever prompted the CI investigation of Flynn , the now-unredacted passages of the report recount that it had come to nothing by the end of 2016 . The FBI ’ s former deputy director , Andrew McCabe , told the committee that “ we really had not substantiated anything particularly significant against General Flynn. ” As noted above , Comey stated that he had approved the closure of the investigation in late December . It seems strange that the file was not closed at that time . Comey indicated that it was “ kept open due to the public discrepancy surrounding General Flynn ’ s communications with Kislyak. ” But that “ discrepancy ” did not arise until mid January , as Trump ’ s inauguration neared .
It was not much of a discrepancy , which no doubt factored into the interviewing agents ’ perception that Flynn did not make intentional misstatements . To the Obama Justice Department , the pressing matter was whether Flynn had promised the Russian ambassador that Trump would undo the sanctions and other penalties Obama had imposed on December 29 . The recorded phone call between Flynn and Kislyak proved that Flynn had made no such commitment .
And so , ladies and gentlemen , what do you suppose the FBI wanted redacted from the report ? If you guessed “ the paragraph describing the Flynn-Kislyak phone call , ” you have caught on to how this wretched game is played . Here ’ s the paragraph that was originally blacked out :
In the call between General Flynn and Ambassador Kislyak , General Flynn “ requested that Russia not escalate the situation and only respond to the U.S. sanctions in a reciprocal manner. ” [ Endnote ( EN ) 90 ] Russia decided not to reciprocate , which eventually led senior U.S. government officials to try to understand why . [ There follows a passage of about two lines followed by EN 91 , both redacted . ] In a subsequent call with General Flynn , Ambassador Kislyak attributed the action to General Flynn ’ s request . [ EN 92 ]
I ’ ve left in the endnotes ( report , p. 58 ) because they confirm that the information in this paragraph comes from a document submitted to the court by Special Counsel Mueller when Flynn pled guilty . ( See Statement of the Offense , p. 3 , paras . e–g . ) It is a public document . To be sure , there is a classified sentence in the middle of the paragraph that may well relate to steps senior U.S. officials took to try to understand Putin ’ s motive for refraining from retaliating against Obama ’ s sanctions . But what conceivable good reason can there have been for the FBI and Justice Department to redact from the report information that was already publicly disclosed ? Why black out public information showing that Flynn merely did what any Obama official , or any other U.S. official , would have done — namely , suggest that Russia would only make things worse by escalating the dispute ?
Is it because this action , simply communicating with the Russian ambassador , is the real reason Flynn was prosecuted ?
Yes , yes , I know — technically , Flynn was prosecuted for making false statements about the conversation , not for having the conversation . Obama officials had hoped to nail Flynn on a heinous crime — a corrupt deal to drop the sanctions as a quid pro quo for Putin ’ s election-meddling that purportedly helped Trump win . Instead , all they could show was a trivial misstep : Flynn ’ s failure to acknowledge that sanctions were mentioned in his conversation with Kislyak — a mention so innocuous that the FBI couldn ’ t decide whether Flynn ’ s failure to describe it was a lie or an innocent failure of recollection .
Is this misstatement really why Flynn was pursued ? I don ’ t think so . Obama officials hounded Flynn because , to this day , they remain vindictive toward political opponents who dared to engage in foreign affairs while Obama was still president . Democrats today are cheering former Secretary of State John Kerry ’ s rallying of foreign governments against President Trump ’ s determination to undo Obama ’ s Iran nuclear deal . They make no mention of possible violations of the Logan Act , which prohibits private citizens from acting on behalf of the U.S. in foreign-policy matters . Apparently , the Logan Act , which has never been successfully used to prosecute anyone , is alive and well only when it comes to General Flynn .
Testifying before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee in May 2017 , former acting attorney general Sally Yates — the same Sally Yates fired by Trump for insubordination over her refusal to execute his so-call travel-ban — explained that it was she who alerted Trump White House Counsel Don McGahn about problems with Flynn . She told him that Flynn ’ s claim that there had been no discussion of sanctions with Kislyak — an assertion later repeated by Vice President Pence , among other Trump officials , in public statements — was wrong .
Yates stressed , however , that “ the first thing we did was to explain to Mr. McGahn that the underlying conduct that General Flynn engaged in was problematic in and of itself . ”
The underlying conduct . Get it ? For Obama officials , the real “ crime ” was that Flynn was talking to Kislyak in the first place — the Logan Act .
As I ’ ve previously noted , since this prosecution theory doesn ’ t pass the laugh test , Obama officials conjured up an alternative “ blackmail ” theory that is even more ludicrous than the Logan Act bunkum . As Yates told the subcommittee ( with a straight face , no less ) Russia had “ leverage ” over Trump ’ s national-security adviser because the Kremlin knew that Flynn had discussed sanctions with Kislyak and , hence , must have lied to Pence — a lie Putin could threaten to reveal unless Flynn did his bidding .
Your average high-school student would readily grasp how silly this is . First , Flynn and Russia also knew that the U.S. intelligence services had a recording of Flynn ’ s conversation with Kislyak . Blackmail only works if the compromising information is secret . The very fact that Yates knew what was on the recording illustrates that Russia had no unique knowledge it could hope to exploit against Flynn . In fact , the Kremlin knew that so many American officials were aware of Flynn ’ s conversation with Kislyak that one of them had leaked it to the Washington Post ’ s David Ignatius two weeks before Yates met with McGahn .
Second , Russia would not have concluded that Flynn necessarily misled Pence just because Pence repeated an inaccuracy . Knowing that misinformation about diplomatic contacts is common , the Kremlin would probably have assumed that the fledgling Trump administration was telling a politically useful lie — the media and Democrats were so agitated about Obama ’ s sanctions that by merely mentioning them , a Trump official risked cries of “ Treason ! ”
The newly unredacted passages in the House report recount that on January 24 , “ following a call from Deputy Director McCabe to General Flynn , made at the direction of Director Comey , ” two agents were dispatched to speak to Flynn . ( Though not identified in the House report , news coverage indicates that one of these agents was Peter Strzok , then chief of the Bureau ’ s counterespionage section . )
Three days into his job as national-security adviser , Flynn had been meeting with many government national-security agents . Strzok ’ s visit must have seemed routine . Having no notice that he was to be interrogated as a criminal suspect , Flynn spoke with the agents alone , without a lawyer . But why was he being treated as a suspect ? The newly unredacted report elaborates :
The Committee received conflicting testimony from Deputy Attorney General ( DAG ) Yates , Director Comey , Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General [ Mary ] McCord , and Deputy Director McCabe about whether the primary purpose of the interview was investigating potentially misleading statements to the Vice President , which the Vice President echoed publicly [ , ] about the content of those calls [ EN 94 , citing Yates ] ; a possible violation of the Logan Act [ EN 95 , citing Yates ] ; or a desire to obtain more information as part of the counterintelligence investigation into General Flynn . [ EN 96 , citing McCabe , who did not recall that Comey had authorized closing the counterintelligence investigation a month earlier . ]
Ask yourself : Was this passage previously blacked out due to proper concerns about national security , or because the relevant officials couldn ’ t get their stories straight ?
Interestingly , in her Senate testimony , Yates recalled that McGahn ’ s commonsense response , upon being told that the FBI had interviewed Flynn on January 24 , 2017 , was to ask how he did – i.e. , did the agents think he lied ? Yates primly told the senators that she , of course , had declined to answer that question — as if , having gone this far , she was suddenly concerned about political interference in an ongoing criminal investigation .
We learn from the newly unredacted paragraphs in the House report , however , that Yates had a more strategic reason for declining to answer : Her depiction to McGahn of a cunning , compromised national-security adviser who was a threat to the president would not have been much of a story if she had to admit that the FBI believed Flynn had not lied in his interview .
As earlier described , Comey has expressed bewilderment in recent media appearances over the Intelligence Committee ’ s assertion , based on his testimony , that interviewing agents did not believe Flynn lied . But now that the previously blacked-out passages have been unredacted , the Committee ’ s thinking is apparent . The report quotes Comey himself :
[ T ] he agents . . . discerned no physical indications of deception . They didn ’ t see any change in posture , in tone , in inflection , in eye contact . They saw nothing that indicated to them that he knew he was lying to them . [ EN 97 , citing then-Director Comey ’ s closed-session Committee testimony on March 2 , 2017 . ]
To be fair to Comey , we have only this snippet of his testimony . Perhaps there are other sections that would put this passage in a different light . Perhaps he recalls saying something that has not been disclosed and that is more consistent with a conclusion that Flynn lied . That ’ s why , in addition to unredacting more of the report , there should be broad disclosure of the underlying testimony and interviews that are now classified .
There is no Department of Justice in the Constitution . It is an executive-branch component created by Congress , funded with taxpayer funds appropriated by Congress , and subject to congressional oversight .
At the moment , though , we know two things for sure : 1 ) Comey unambiguously stated that , at least initially , the agents did not find that Flynn had lied ; and 2 ) as long as Comey was FBI director , Flynn was never charged with lying .
If anything , McCabe ’ s December 19 , 2017 , testimony ( currently also under lock and key ) was even more favorable to Flynn . The report ’ s newly unredacted passages quote him :
[ The ] conundrum that we faced on their return from the interview is that although [ the agents ] didn ’ t detect deception in the statements that [ Flynn ] made in the interview . . . the statements were inconsistent with our understanding of the conversation he had actually had with the [ Russian ] ambassador .
The two people who interviewed [ Flynn ] didn ’ t think he was lying , [ which ] was not [ a ] great beginning of a false statement case .
There is no Department of Justice in the Constitution . It is an executive-branch component created by Congress , funded with taxpayer funds appropriated by Congress , and subject to congressional oversight to ensure that its operations are conducted in accordance with their statutory purposes . Because of the sensitivity of their law-enforcement and intelligence missions , the Justice Department and its premier agency , the FBI , are shown great deference when lawmakers make requests — or even demands — for information . Contrary to what Justice Department leadership apparently believes , this deference is not an entitlement . It is result of respect earned over time by an institution that — its proud alumni like to believe — has a tradition of dealing honorably and transparently with peer branches of government .
It is a fact of life that the precious commodity of a good reputation takes much less time to lose than to build .
There is no defending the redactions that have now been disclosed . Especially in light of recent history , this powerfully suggests that there is no justification for withholding much else that the Justice Department refuses to reveal .

What happened with these redactions is inexcusable.

Background

A little over a week ago, the House committee chaired by Representative Devin Nunes (R., Calif.) published its lengthy report on Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. The report was actually completed weeks earlier but was withheld while the committee battled to disclose information that the Justice Department and FBI insisted on blacking out. As usual, the DOJ claimed that the declassification and release of the information would damage investigations and national security. No, it wouldn’t, countered Chairmen Nunes and other Republicans who knew what had been redacted.

When the Comey memos were finally disclosed, we learned that there was no investigative or national-security reason to have concealed them.

This has become a depressingly familiar dance. Justice and the Bureau previously insisted that the sky would fall if Congress forced the release of an Intelligence Committee report on government abuse of foreign-intelligence surveillance powers. To the contrary, we learned that the FBI and DOJ had used the unverified Steele dossier to obtain surveillance warrants on at least one person tied to the Trump campaign, in contravention of express guidelines that “only documented and verified information may be used to support FBI applications to the [FISA] court” (see Nunes’s March 1 letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions). In addition, we learned that the FISA court was not told that the dossier was a Clinton campaign opposition-research project, and that its author, Christopher Steele, had been terminated as an informant for lying to the FBI about his contacts with the media.

More recently, the FBI severely restricted access to former FBI director James Comey’s memos of his meetings with President Trump. Finally, three congressional committees protested that there was no legal basis for such restriction. When the memos were finally disclosed, we learned that there was no investigative or national-security reason to have concealed them. They did, however, provide greater insight about such matters as how a briefing of then-president-elect Trump on a salacious sliver of the dossier (but not on its sensational allegations of a traitorous conspiracy with the Kremlin) led to an intelligence-community leak about the briefing and the consequent media publication of the dossier — the backbone of the media-Democratic “collusion with Russia” narrative.

Comey vs. the Committee: Did Agents Believe Flynn Lied?

When the House first issued its report on the Russia investigation, a heavily redacted portion (pp. 53–54) related that Trump’s original national-security adviser, Michael Flynn, had pled guilty to a false-statements charge based on misleading statements to FBI agents about his December 2016 conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The report explained that Flynn had been rebuffed by Kislyak when, based on instructions from the Trump transition team, Flynn asked Russia to refrain from voting in favor of a U.N. resolution condemning Israel. Flynn also discussed with the transition team what, if anything, he should communicate to Kislyak about Trump’s position on the sanctions that President Obama had imposed on Russia over its interference in the 2016 election.

None of this was new information. Indeed, the committee noted that it was drawn from public court filings by Special Counsel Robert Mueller in connection with Flynn’s guilty plea. But there was one intriguing disclosure in the redacted report: Flynn pled guilty “even though the [FBI] agents did not detect any deception during Flynn’s interview.” There was no elaboration on this point — no discussion of why Flynn was interrogated by FBI agents in the first place; no insight on deliberations within the FBI and Justice Department about whether Flynn had deceptive intent; no explanation of how he came to be charged months later by Mueller’s prosecutors even though the trained investigators who observed Flynn’s demeanor during the interview did not believe he’d lied.

This news that Flynn’s interrogators had not sensed deception was not altogether new. It had been reported that then–FBI director James Comey had made this revelation in closed-session testimony before the committee on March 2, 2017. (See my column.) Yet, during media interviews to promote his just-released memoir, Comey — who has rebuked the House Intelligence Committee report as an effort to tear down our law-enforcement institutions — repeatedly expressed bafflement that anyone could possibly have construed his testimony to imply that the agents believed Flynn had not lied. Byron York recounts the interviews at the Washington Examiner. In one, Comey told ABC host and Clinton pal George Stephanopoulos:

I don’t know where that’s coming from. . . . That — unless I’m — I said something that people misunderstood, I don’t remember even intending to say that. So, my recollection is I never said that to anybody.

The now-unredacted passages reveal that top Obama DOJ and FBI officials provided the committee with ‘conflicting testimony’ about why the FBI interviewed Flynn as if he were a criminal suspect.

Well, shortly after the redactions were lifted late on Friday, The Federalist’s Sean Davis got busy on Twitter, posting side-by-side comparisons of the original heavily redacted pages and the new, more transparent version. The disclosures are stunning. I know this will amaze you, but it turns out the redactions had absolutely nothing to do with concerns about the need to protect national security or pending investigations. Instead, the now-unredacted passages:

Elaborate on why the FBI did not believe Flynn had lied, including quotations from Comey’s testimony.

Reveal that for some period of time during 2016, the FBI conducted a counterintelligence (CI) investigation of Flynn.

Note that top Obama Justice Department and FBI officials provided the committee with “conflicting testimony” about why the FBI interviewed Flynn as if he were a criminal suspect.

Illustrate that the FBI and Justice Department originally insisted on concealment of facts helpful to Flynn that are already public.

Counterintelligence Investigation of Flynn

The now-unredacted passages relate that, for some period of time during 2016, the FBI was conducting a “CI investigation into General Flynn.” It was Comey’s recollection that he had “authorized the closure” of that investigation “by late December 2016.”

As we have discussed in connection with Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser against whom the Obama Justice Department obtained FISA surveillance warrants, a CI investigation on an American citizen proceeds on the suspicion that the citizen is an agent of a foreign power whose clandestine activities violate federal criminal law. That is, it appears possible (if not likely) that the Justice Department was operating on the theory that Flynn — a decorated combat veteran and co-author of a 2016 book that brands Russia as an implacable enemy of the United States — was an agent of the Kremlin.

At some point, moreover, Justice rationalized the investigation into Flynn, at least in part, by relying on the Logan Act. An almost surely unconstitutional 18th-century statute, the Logan Act purports to prohibit Americans from unauthorized freelancing in foreign-policy. It has never been successfully used to prosecute anyone. (Compare then-director Comey’s July 5, 2016, press conference and subsequent testimony, in which he theorized that charging Hillary Clinton for a rarely prosecuted classified-information offense would violate Justice Department policy against selective prosecution.)

The startling fact that there was a CI investigation of Flynn does not, of course, tell us on what evidence suspicions against him were based. As I’ve previously contended (when it was not known that there was a CI investigation, but it was apparent that Flynn had been seen as a criminal suspect), there are profound reasons to question the legitimacy of Flynn’s treatment.

Notwithstanding Friday night’s unveiling of blacked-out passages, the report still contains redacted paragraphs about Flynn. Two of them (on pp. 52–53) sandwich a passage about a business trip Flynn took to Moscow in late 2015 (seven months before he branded Russia a committed enemy in his book). The trip followed a visit to Kislyak by Flynn and his son at the ambassador’s Washington residence.

Though not mentioned in the unredacted passage, it has been reported that Flynn was paid more than $45,000 by Russia’s state-owned propaganda network, RT, for a speech he gave while in Moscow — an event at which he sat next to President Vladimir Putin. On the current state of disclosure, we do not know how, if at all, this incident played into the decision to investigate Flynn. Neither do we know whether the FBI and Justice Department took any action when former President Bill Clinton received $500,000 from a Kremlin-connected bank for a short speech delivered in 2010 on a trip to Russia, during which he met with Putin — even as his wife, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, was among the U.S. officials considering and ultimately green-lighting Russia’s effort to acquire rights to one-fifth of America’s uranium stock.

The suggestion that Flynn’s post-election contacts with Russia were improper, let alone unlawful, is absurd. Flynn was the designated national-security adviser for the incoming administration and a key member of the Trump transition team. To have communications with officials of foreign governments was a legitimate and necessary part of his job.

It is worth noting that Flynn had been fired by Obama from his post as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and is despised by Obama intelligence officials for having become an ardent public adversary against Obama’s national-security policy, most prominently as candidate Trump’s most visible supporter. The interest of Obama’s DOJ and FBI in Flynn appears to have intensified after Trump won the election, when Flynn was presumed to be laying groundwork to reverse Obama’s positions — as Trump promised to do throughout the campaign.

While it is only natural that Obama officials would seethe over Flynn’s ascendancy, the suggestion that his post-election contacts with Russia were improper, let alone unlawful, is absurd. Flynn was the designated national-security adviser for the incoming administration and a key member of the Trump transition team. To have communications with officials of foreign governments was a legitimate and necessary part of his job. Plus, Kislyak was a foreign agent subject to FISA surveillance, so the FBI had recordings of his communications with Flynn and knew that Flynn had done nothing improper. (It has been presumed that Flynn’s communications with Kislyak were intercepted because Kislyak, not Flynn, was the subject of a FISA warrant; now, with confirmation that Flynn was the subject of a counterintelligence investigation, we may need to revisit that presumption.)

Whatever prompted the CI investigation of Flynn, the now-unredacted passages of the report recount that it had come to nothing by the end of 2016. The FBI’s former deputy director, Andrew McCabe, told the committee that “we really had not substantiated anything particularly significant against General Flynn.” As noted above, Comey stated that he had approved the closure of the investigation in late December. It seems strange that the file was not closed at that time. Comey indicated that it was “kept open due to the public discrepancy surrounding General Flynn’s communications with Kislyak.” But that “discrepancy” did not arise until mid January, as Trump’s inauguration neared.

It was not much of a discrepancy, which no doubt factored into the interviewing agents’ perception that Flynn did not make intentional misstatements. To the Obama Justice Department, the pressing matter was whether Flynn had promised the Russian ambassador that Trump would undo the sanctions and other penalties Obama had imposed on December 29. The recorded phone call between Flynn and Kislyak proved that Flynn had made no such commitment.

And so, ladies and gentlemen, what do you suppose the FBI wanted redacted from the report? If you guessed “the paragraph describing the Flynn-Kislyak phone call,” you have caught on to how this wretched game is played. Here’s the paragraph that was originally blacked out:

In the call between General Flynn and Ambassador Kislyak, General Flynn “requested that Russia not escalate the situation and only respond to the U.S. sanctions in a reciprocal manner.” [Endnote (EN) 90] Russia decided not to reciprocate, which eventually led senior U.S. government officials to try to understand why. [There follows a passage of about two lines followed by EN 91, both redacted.] In a subsequent call with General Flynn, Ambassador Kislyak attributed the action to General Flynn’s request. [EN 92]

I’ve left in the endnotes (report, p. 58) because they confirm that the information in this paragraph comes from a document submitted to the court by Special Counsel Mueller when Flynn pled guilty. (See Statement of the Offense, p. 3, paras. e–g.) It is a public document. To be sure, there is a classified sentence in the middle of the paragraph that may well relate to steps senior U.S. officials took to try to understand Putin’s motive for refraining from retaliating against Obama’s sanctions. But what conceivable good reason can there have been for the FBI and Justice Department to redact from the report information that was already publicly disclosed? Why black out public information showing that Flynn merely did what any Obama official, or any other U.S. official, would have done — namely, suggest that Russia would only make things worse by escalating the dispute?

Is it because this action, simply communicating with the Russian ambassador, is the real reason Flynn was prosecuted?

Why Was Flynn Subjected to a Criminal Investigation?

Yes, yes, I know — technically, Flynn was prosecuted for making false statements about the conversation, not for having the conversation. Obama officials had hoped to nail Flynn on a heinous crime — a corrupt deal to drop the sanctions as a quid pro quo for Putin’s election-meddling that purportedly helped Trump win. Instead, all they could show was a trivial misstep: Flynn’s failure to acknowledge that sanctions were mentioned in his conversation with Kislyak — a mention so innocuous that the FBI couldn’t decide whether Flynn’s failure to describe it was a lie or an innocent failure of recollection.

Is this misstatement really why Flynn was pursued? I don’t think so. Obama officials hounded Flynn because, to this day, they remain vindictive toward political opponents who dared to engage in foreign affairs while Obama was still president. Democrats today are cheering former Secretary of State John Kerry’s rallying of foreign governments against President Trump’s determination to undo Obama’s Iran nuclear deal. They make no mention of possible violations of the Logan Act, which prohibits private citizens from acting on behalf of the U.S. in foreign-policy matters. Apparently, the Logan Act, which has never been successfully used to prosecute anyone, is alive and well only when it comes to General Flynn.

Testifying before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee in May 2017, former acting attorney general Sally Yates — the same Sally Yates fired by Trump for insubordination over her refusal to execute his so-call travel-ban — explained that it was she who alerted Trump White House Counsel Don McGahn about problems with Flynn. She told him that Flynn’s claim that there had been no discussion of sanctions with Kislyak — an assertion later repeated by Vice President Pence, among other Trump officials, in public statements — was wrong.

Yates stressed, however, that “the first thing we did was to explain to Mr. McGahn that the underlying conduct that General Flynn engaged in was problematic in and of itself.”

The underlying conduct. Get it? For Obama officials, the real “crime” was that Flynn was talking to Kislyak in the first place — the Logan Act.

As I’ve previously noted, since this prosecution theory doesn’t pass the laugh test, Obama officials conjured up an alternative “blackmail” theory that is even more ludicrous than the Logan Act bunkum. As Yates told the subcommittee (with a straight face, no less) Russia had “leverage” over Trump’s national-security adviser because the Kremlin knew that Flynn had discussed sanctions with Kislyak and, hence, must have lied to Pence — a lie Putin could threaten to reveal unless Flynn did his bidding.

Your average high-school student would readily grasp how silly this is. First, Flynn and Russia also knew that the U.S. intelligence services had a recording of Flynn’s conversation with Kislyak. Blackmail only works if the compromising information is secret. The very fact that Yates knew what was on the recording illustrates that Russia had no unique knowledge it could hope to exploit against Flynn. In fact, the Kremlin knew that so many American officials were aware of Flynn’s conversation with Kislyak that one of them had leaked it to the Washington Post’s David Ignatius two weeks before Yates met with McGahn.

Second, Russia would not have concluded that Flynn necessarily misled Pence just because Pence repeated an inaccuracy. Knowing that misinformation about diplomatic contacts is common, the Kremlin would probably have assumed that the fledgling Trump administration was telling a politically useful lie — the media and Democrats were so agitated about Obama’s sanctions that by merely mentioning them, a Trump official risked cries of “Treason!”

The newly unredacted passages in the House report recount that on January 24, “following a call from Deputy Director McCabe to General Flynn, made at the direction of Director Comey,” two agents were dispatched to speak to Flynn. (Though not identified in the House report, news coverage indicates that one of these agents was Peter Strzok, then chief of the Bureau’s counterespionage section.)

Three days into his job as national-security adviser, Flynn had been meeting with many government national-security agents. Strzok’s visit must have seemed routine. Having no notice that he was to be interrogated as a criminal suspect, Flynn spoke with the agents alone, without a lawyer. But why was he being treated as a suspect? The newly unredacted report elaborates:

The Committee received conflicting testimony from Deputy Attorney General (DAG) Yates, Director Comey, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General [Mary] McCord, and Deputy Director McCabe about whether the primary purpose of the interview was investigating potentially misleading statements to the Vice President, which the Vice President echoed publicly[,] about the content of those calls [EN 94, citing Yates]; a possible violation of the Logan Act [EN 95, citing Yates]; or a desire to obtain more information as part of the counterintelligence investigation into General Flynn. [EN 96, citing McCabe, who did not recall that Comey had authorized closing the counterintelligence investigation a month earlier.]

Ask yourself: Was this passage previously blacked out due to proper concerns about national security, or because the relevant officials couldn’t get their stories straight?

Did the Interviewing Agents Believe Flynn Lied to Them?

Interestingly, in her Senate testimony, Yates recalled that McGahn’s commonsense response, upon being told that the FBI had interviewed Flynn on January 24, 2017, was to ask how he did – i.e., did the agents think he lied? Yates primly told the senators that she, of course, had declined to answer that question — as if, having gone this far, she was suddenly concerned about political interference in an ongoing criminal investigation.

We learn from the newly unredacted paragraphs in the House report, however, that Yates had a more strategic reason for declining to answer: Her depiction to McGahn of a cunning, compromised national-security adviser who was a threat to the president would not have been much of a story if she had to admit that the FBI believed Flynn had not lied in his interview.

As earlier described, Comey has expressed bewilderment in recent media appearances over the Intelligence Committee’s assertion, based on his testimony, that interviewing agents did not believe Flynn lied. But now that the previously blacked-out passages have been unredacted, the Committee’s thinking is apparent. The report quotes Comey himself:

[T]he agents . . . discerned no physical indications of deception. They didn’t see any change in posture, in tone, in inflection, in eye contact. They saw nothing that indicated to them that he knew he was lying to them. [EN 97, citing then-Director Comey’s closed-session Committee testimony on March 2, 2017.]

To be fair to Comey, we have only this snippet of his testimony. Perhaps there are other sections that would put this passage in a different light. Perhaps he recalls saying something that has not been disclosed and that is more consistent with a conclusion that Flynn lied. That’s why, in addition to unredacting more of the report, there should be broad disclosure of the underlying testimony and interviews that are now classified.

There is no Department of Justice in the Constitution. It is an executive-branch component created by Congress, funded with taxpayer funds appropriated by Congress, and subject to congressional oversight.

At the moment, though, we know two things for sure: 1) Comey unambiguously stated that, at least initially, the agents did not find that Flynn had lied; and 2) as long as Comey was FBI director, Flynn was never charged with lying.

If anything, McCabe’s December 19, 2017, testimony (currently also under lock and key) was even more favorable to Flynn. The report’s newly unredacted passages quote him:

[The] conundrum that we faced on their return from the interview is that although [the agents] didn’t detect deception in the statements that [Flynn] made in the interview . . . the statements were inconsistent with our understanding of the conversation he had actually had with the [Russian] ambassador.

McCabe added, in another just unredacted passage:

The two people who interviewed [Flynn] didn’t think he was lying, [which] was not [a] great beginning of a false statement case.

Conclusion

There is no Department of Justice in the Constitution. It is an executive-branch component created by Congress, funded with taxpayer funds appropriated by Congress, and subject to congressional oversight to ensure that its operations are conducted in accordance with their statutory purposes. Because of the sensitivity of their law-enforcement and intelligence missions, the Justice Department and its premier agency, the FBI, are shown great deference when lawmakers make requests — or even demands — for information. Contrary to what Justice Department leadership apparently believes, this deference is not an entitlement. It is result of respect earned over time by an institution that — its proud alumni like to believe — has a tradition of dealing honorably and transparently with peer branches of government.

It is a fact of life that the precious commodity of a good reputation takes much less time to lose than to build.

There is no defending the redactions that have now been disclosed. Especially in light of recent history, this powerfully suggests that there is no justification for withholding much else that the Justice Department refuses to reveal.

John Ratcliffe , a Trump loyalist without intelligence experience nominated by the U.S. president to become the nation ’ s top intelligence chief , faced a deeply divided panel of U.S. senators on Tuesday . Over the course of his Senate confirmation hearing , Democratic lawmakers questioned his fitness for the post in the wake of his fiery support for President Donald Trump during the impeachment trial and the president ’ s own chronic misrepresentation of facts that has put him at odds with the U.S. intelligence community in the past .
Ratcliffe , a Republican from Texas who at one point was considered unqualified for the job by some fellow Republicans as well as Democrats , sought to portray himself as a director of national intelligence who would leave politics at the door to deliver “ unvarnished ” truth to the president .
But some critics , wary of his lack of experience in the intelligence community , are worried that he ’ ll put political loyalty ahead of his responsibilities to deliver intelligence assessments to the president . Ratcliffe withdrew himself from consideration for the post in August 2019 , after facing criticism that he lacked the right qualifications and embellished his resume . Trump resubmitted his nomination in February .
“ I think he is the most unqualified person ever formally nominated to this position , ” said Larry Pfeiffer , who spent 32 years in the U.S. intelligence community and served as chief of staff to CIA Director Michael Hayden .
Ratcliffe , if confirmed , would take the helm of the U.S. intelligence community as it faces unprecedented levels of political pressure from the president and his allies . His rocky path to the nomination came in the wake of a hyperpartisan impeachment investigation started by a whistleblower complaint from a U.S. intelligence official , as well as years of simmering discord between Trump and other senior officials inside the intelligence community . Those tensions led to the firing or forced resignation of key senior intelligence officials in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ( ODNI ) , leaving the office without a single Senate-confirmed official .
Ratcliffe became one of Trump ’ s fiercest defenders during the impeachment inquiry , accusing Democrats of helping write the whistleblower complaint when there was no evidence they had done so and misrepresenting other facts and statements from witnesses throughout the Democratic-led investigation in the House .
Veteran intelligence officials have voiced concerns over the health of the ODNI under Richard Grenell , Trump ’ s acting intelligence chief . Grenell , a political loyalist with no prior experience in intelligence , has overseen a hiring freeze and reorganization of the office and engaged in high-profile Twitter spats with political rivals that former intelligence officials view as unbecoming of the office .
“ I think it ’ s best if the DNI has actually served in an intelligence position , preferably as an Agency director , as a minimum , ” said James Clapper , who served as director of national intelligence for nearly seven years .
Ratcliffe sought to allay concerns about his nomination during the hearing , held in a sparse hearing room on Capitol Hill on Tuesday to adhere to social distancing measures during the coronavirus pandemic . ( Senators rotated in and out of the room to question Ratcliffe to minimize the number of people in the room at a time . )
“ If confirmed as DNI , my top priority will be to present the president , senior policymakers in this committee with objective and timely intelligence to better inform decisions about the future and safety of our great nation , ” he said . “ As the president ’ s principal intelligence advisor I would ensure that all intelligence is collected , analyzed , and reported without bias , prejudice , or political influence . ”
A lawyer by trade , Ratcliffe is a member of the House intelligence , judiciary , and ethics committees . He formerly served as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Texas from 2007 to 2008 and mayor of Heath , Texas from 2004 to 2012 .
Republican senators—including those who reacted coolly to his initial nomination—have since expressed support for him , in part because they feel ODNI simply needs a Senate-confirmed leader as soon as possible to restore the office ’ s clout . “ I know he ’ s ready to get to work leading the intelligence community , which has continued to do its vital work under increasingly difficult conditions , ” said Republican Sen. Richard Burr , the chairman of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee .
“ We need to be able to count on a leader to operate free of personal or political motivation , serving only with the security and safety of the American people in mind , and I believe John Ratcliffe is the person to do that job , ” said Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn , who introduced Ratcliffe at the hearing .
If the senators fail to give their seal of approval to Ratcliffe , a law on government vacancies stipulates that the acting director of national intelligence can remain in the position for another seven months , effectively forcing lawmakers to choose between Ratcliffe and Grenell , who also has no previous intelligence experience .
Senators in the hearing also grilled Ratcliffe on his record during the impeachment investigation , intelligence on the origins of the coronavirus pandemic , foreign interference in the 2020 elections , and how he would protect the intelligence community and whistleblowers from political pressures .
Under questioning from Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein , Ratcliffe pledged to protect whistleblowers if confirmed as director of national intelligence . “ Every whistleblower , past , present , and future , will enjoy every protection under the law . I don ’ t want to relitigate old issues of what happened during the impeachment inquiry , ” he said .
“ Whistleblowers are so important , a whistleblower doctor in China is one of the reasons we got an earlier warning , ” he added , referring to the initial coronavirus outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan .
Accountability advocates have long been skeptical about Ratcliffe ’ s commitment to whistleblowers . “ I ’ m mostly concerned with his potential effect on whistleblowing , ” said Irvin McCullough , a national security analyst with the Government Accountability Project , a nonprofit whistleblower protection organization .
Intelligence community employees have more restricted opportunities to blow the whistle on perceived wrongdoing due to the sensitivity of their work , leaving considerable power in the hands of the director of national intelligence to accept or reject complaints brought forward . “ There ’ s certainly a chilling effect for intelligence community employees that would watch him become DNI , ” McCullough said .
When Trump first tapped Ratcliffe for the job in July 2019 , he said he did so to “ rein in ” the U.S. intelligence community . “ We need somebody like that there , ” the president said . “ We need somebody strong that can really rein it in , because , as I think you ’ ve all learned , the intelligence agencies have run amok . They ’ ve run amok . ”
“ I don ’ t think that the men and women of the intelligence community are running amok , ” Ratcliffe said Tuesday when pressed on the comments .
The intelligence committee was thrust into the spotlight during the impeachment investigation into Trump . Ratcliffe emerged as one of the president ’ s most vocal defenders , downplaying evidence of a quid pro quo over military aid to Ukraine and castigating the whistleblower whose complaint kickstarted the investigation . As the House Judiciary Committee weighed articles of impeachment in December , Ratcliffe responded to a question about whether it was ever appropriate to a president to solicit foreign interference in an election , Ratcliffe said , “ The answer is yes . It better be , we do it all the time . ”
During the hearing , Ratcliffe also made clear his top priority as director of national intelligence would be China , with a focus of confirming how the pandemic spread in the first place . “ If confirmed , the intelligence community will be laser-focused on getting all of the answers that we can regarding how this happened , when this happened , and I commit to providing [ you ] with as much transparency to you as the law will allow , ” he told lawmakers .
Trump has claimed he has intelligence indicating the new coronavirus emerged in a Chinese laboratory . But intelligence circulated among the United States and its closest allies reportedly suggests this is “ highly unlikely , ” and the more likely scenario is that the virus spread naturally from animals to humans—the latest example of the president disputing or contradicting U.S. intelligence assessments .
Some former intelligence officials say Ratcliffe ’ s record during the impeachment trial should prevent him from getting the job . “ He is patently and aggressively a partisan extremist , he has difficulty with the truth and consorts with fringe , extremist , and conspiracy theorists , ” said John Sipher , a former member of the CIA ’ s Senior Intelligence Service .
Democratic Sen. Mark Warner , the vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , also raised concerns over the current state of the ODNI , which was initially established in 2004 to coordinate work across the various agencies in the intelligence community . In the past year , senior ODNI officials were either sacked or forced to step down from their posts in the wake of the impeachment saga or for providing intelligence assessments that undercut the president ’ s own claims . Among those removed from their posts were Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats , Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence Sue Gordon , acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire , acting Director of the National Counterterrorism Center Russ Travers , and Inspector General of the Intelligence Community Michael Atkinson .
“ What we ’ ve seen over the last year has been especially dangerous : the systematic firing of anyone at the ODNI who has had the temerity to speak truth to power , ” Warner told Ratcliffe during the hearing . “ Some have suggested that your main qualification for confirmation to this post is that you are not Ambassador Grenell , ” he added . “ But frankly , that ’ s not enough . ”","Senators Question Fitness of Trump’s Nominee for Intelligence Chief

“If confirmed as DNI, my top priority will be to present the president, senior policymakers in this committee with objective and timely intelligence to better inform decisions about the future and safety of our great nation,” he said. “As the president’s principal intelligence advisor I would ensure that all intelligence is collected, analyzed, and reported without bias, prejudice, or political influence.”

A lawyer by trade, Ratcliffe is a member of the House intelligence, judiciary, and ethics committees. He formerly served as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Texas from 2007 to 2008 and mayor of Heath, Texas from 2004 to 2012.

Republican senators—including those who reacted coolly to his initial nomination—have since expressed support for him, in part because they feel ODNI simply needs a Senate-confirmed leader as soon as possible to restore the office’s clout. “I know he’s ready to get to work leading the intelligence community, which has continued to do its vital work under increasingly difficult conditions,” said Republican Sen. Richard Burr, the chairman of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee.

“We need to be able to count on a leader to operate free of personal or political motivation, serving only with the security and safety of the American people in mind, and I believe John Ratcliffe is the person to do that job,” said Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn, who introduced Ratcliffe at the hearing.

If the senators fail to give their seal of approval to Ratcliffe, a law on government vacancies stipulates that the acting director of national intelligence can remain in the position for another seven months, effectively forcing lawmakers to choose between Ratcliffe and Grenell, who also has no previous intelligence experience.

Senators in the hearing also grilled Ratcliffe on his record during the impeachment investigation, intelligence on the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, foreign interference in the 2020 elections, and how he would protect the intelligence community and whistleblowers from political pressures.

Under questioning from Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Ratcliffe pledged to protect whistleblowers if confirmed as director of national intelligence. “Every whistleblower, past, present, and future, will enjoy every protection under the law. I don’t want to relitigate old issues of what happened during the impeachment inquiry,” he said.

“Whistleblowers are so important, a whistleblower doctor in China is one of the reasons we got an earlier warning,” he added, referring to the initial coronavirus outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan.

Accountability advocates have long been skeptical about Ratcliffe’s commitment to whistleblowers. “I’m mostly concerned with his potential effect on whistleblowing,” said Irvin McCullough, a national security analyst with the Government Accountability Project, a nonprofit whistleblower protection organization.

Intelligence community employees have more restricted opportunities to blow the whistle on perceived wrongdoing due to the sensitivity of their work, leaving considerable power in the hands of the director of national intelligence to accept or reject complaints brought forward. “There’s certainly a chilling effect for intelligence community employees that would watch him become DNI,” McCullough said.

When Trump first tapped Ratcliffe for the job in July 2019, he said he did so to “rein in” the U.S. intelligence community. “We need somebody like that there,” the president said. “We need somebody strong that can really rein it in, because, as I think you’ve all learned, the intelligence agencies have run amok. They’ve run amok.”

“I don’t think that the men and women of the intelligence community are running amok,” Ratcliffe said Tuesday when pressed on the comments.

The intelligence committee was thrust into the spotlight during the impeachment investigation into Trump. Ratcliffe emerged as one of the president’s most vocal defenders, downplaying evidence of a quid pro quo over military aid to Ukraine and castigating the whistleblower whose complaint kickstarted the investigation. As the House Judiciary Committee weighed articles of impeachment in December, Ratcliffe responded to a question about whether it was ever appropriate to a president to solicit foreign interference in an election, Ratcliffe said, “The answer is yes. It better be, we do it all the time.”

During the hearing, Ratcliffe also made clear his top priority as director of national intelligence would be China, with a focus of confirming how the pandemic spread in the first place. “If confirmed, the intelligence community will be laser-focused on getting all of the answers that we can regarding how this happened, when this happened, and I commit to providing [you] with as much transparency to you as the law will allow,” he told lawmakers.

Trump has claimed he has intelligence indicating the new coronavirus emerged in a Chinese laboratory. But intelligence circulated among the United States and its closest allies reportedly suggests this is “highly unlikely,” and the more likely scenario is that the virus spread naturally from animals to humans—the latest example of the president disputing or contradicting U.S. intelligence assessments.

Some former intelligence officials say Ratcliffe’s record during the impeachment trial should prevent him from getting the job. “He is patently and aggressively a partisan extremist, he has difficulty with the truth and consorts with fringe, extremist, and conspiracy theorists,” said John Sipher, a former member of the CIA’s Senior Intelligence Service.

Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, the vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, also raised concerns over the current state of the ODNI, which was initially established in 2004 to coordinate work across the various agencies in the intelligence community. In the past year, senior ODNI officials were either sacked or forced to step down from their posts in the wake of the impeachment saga or for providing intelligence assessments that undercut the president’s own claims. Among those removed from their posts were Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence Sue Gordon, acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, acting Director of the National Counterterrorism Center Russ Travers, and Inspector General of the Intelligence Community Michael Atkinson.

“What we’ve seen over the last year has been especially dangerous: the systematic firing of anyone at the ODNI who has had the temerity to speak truth to power,” Warner told Ratcliffe during the hearing. “Some have suggested that your main qualification for confirmation to this post is that you are not Ambassador Grenell,” he added. “But frankly, that’s not enough.”",www.foreignpolicy.com,center,Aq3P5JB1zDRQWBMW

Comey outlined nine contacts with the president in a seven-page opening statement filed with the Senate Intelligence Committee , where he is due to speak publicly Thursday for the first time since he was abruptly fired in May in the midst of a widening FBI investigation into whether Trump associates colluded with Russian officials who sought to influence the presidential election by hacking Democrats .
These contacts included a hastily-arranged Jan. 27 dinner in which Trump made an unusual request to the FBI chief overseeing the Russia inquiry : “ I need loyalty , I expect loyalty . ’ ’
“ I didn ’ t move , speak or change my facial expression any way during the awkward silence that followed , ’ ’ Comey said of the exchange . `` We simply looked at each other in silence . ''
Later , in a Feb. 14 meeting at the White House , Comey said Trump strongly defended Flynn , saying that his former national security adviser “ hadn ’ t done anything wrong ’ ’ in his prior contact with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak . Flynn had been fired one day prior for lying to administration officials about his communications with Kislyak .
“ I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go , ’ ’ Comey said , quoting the president . “ He is a good guy . I hope you can let this go . ’ ’
Alarmed by the exchange , Comey said he prepared an `` unclassified memo '' immediately after the conversation and later discussed it with FBI senior leadership .
“ I had understood the president to be requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador in December , '' Comey said . `` I did not understand the president to be talking about the broader investigation into Russia or possible links to his campaign . I could be wrong … Regardless , it was very concerning given the FBI ’ s role as an independent investigative agency . ’ ’
Comey 's testimony does , however , include a concession to Trump , confirming the president 's previous assertions that the director informed him on three separate occasions that he was not a subject of the FBI 's Russia investigation . Comey said he relayed the information to the president during his first Jan. 6 briefing with the then-president-elect , the Jan. 27 White House dinner and a March 30 telephone call .
Trump 's lawyer immediately seized on information , claiming that it amounted to a public acknowledgement that Trump `` was not under investigation in any Russian probe . ''
`` The President feels completely and totally vindicated , '' Trump attorney Marc Kasowitz said in a written statement . `` He is eager to continue to move forward with his agenda . ''
Still , Comey 's written statement is more than a simple recounting of conversations with Trump . It is remarkable for its detail , describing furnishings in the rooms where they met , their seating arrangements and their often wide-ranging discussions by telephone .
Comey testimony : 4 other times the ex-FBI director starred in unusual public dramas
In one of his six telephone contacts with the president , Comey said Trump called him directly at FBI headquarters March 30 and described the ongoing Russia investigation as `` a cloud '' that was impairing the president 's ability to lead the country .
`` He said he had nothing to do with Russia , had not been involved with hookers in Russia and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia , '' Comey wrote , referring to the sexually-charged contents of an unsubstantiated dossier that purported to link Trump to the Kremlin .
`` He asked what we could do to 'lift the cloud . ' I responded that we were investigating the matter as quickly as we could , and that there would be great benefit , if we did n't find anything , to our having done the work well . He agreed , but then re-emphasized the problems this ( investigation ) was causing him . ''
Toward the end of the extraordinary conversation , Comey said that Trump again stressed that the `` cloud '' of the Russia investigation was interfering with his ability to govern .
`` He hoped that I could find a way to get out that he was n't being investigated , '' Comey wrote . `` I told him I would see what we could do , and that we would do our investigative work well and as quickly as we could . ''
Immediately after that March 30 call , Comey said he reported the conversation to then-acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente . Attorney General Jeff Sessions had earlier recused himself from considering all Russia-related matters because he had failed to disclose his own previous contacts with the Russian ambassador during his January confirmation hearing .
`` I did not hear back from him before the president called me again two weeks later '' to ask what Comey had done to `` get out '' the word that Trump was `` not personally under investigation . ''
Comey said he ultimately told Trump to pursue that information through Boente 's office , `` which was the traditional channel '' for contacts between the White House and the FBI .
The director 's encounters with Trump were so unusual and often uncomfortable , that Comey started memorializing the communications in memos , starting with his first Jan. 6 meeting at Trump Tower in Manhattan where the director briefed the president-elect on the contents of an unsubstantiated and sexually-charged dossier purporting to link Trump to the Kremlin .
`` I felt compelled to document my first conversation with the president-elect in a memo , '' Comey wrote , adding that he began to compose it `` on a laptop in an FBI vehicle outside Trump Tower the moment I walked out of the meeting .
Creating written records of immediately after one-on-one conversations with Mr. Trump was my practice from that point forward . This had not been my practice in the past . ''","Kevin Johnson

“I didn’t move, speak or change my facial expression any way during the awkward silence that followed,’’ Comey said of the exchange. ""We simply looked at each other in silence.''

Later, in a Feb. 14 meeting at the White House, Comey said Trump strongly defended Flynn, saying that his former national security adviser “hadn’t done anything wrong’’ in his prior contact with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn had been fired one day prior for lying to administration officials about his communications with Kislyak.

“I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go,’’ Comey said, quoting the president. “He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.’’

Alarmed by the exchange, Comey said he prepared an ""unclassified memo'' immediately after the conversation and later discussed it with FBI senior leadership.

“I had understood the president to be requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador in December,'' Comey said. ""I did not understand the president to be talking about the broader investigation into Russia or possible links to his campaign. I could be wrong … Regardless, it was very concerning given the FBI’s role as an independent investigative agency.’’

Comey's testimony does, however, include a concession to Trump, confirming the president's previous assertions that the director informed him on three separate occasions that he was not a subject of the FBI's Russia investigation. Comey said he relayed the information to the president during his first Jan. 6 briefing with the then-president-elect, the Jan. 27 White House dinner and a March 30 telephone call.

Trump's lawyer immediately seized on information, claiming that it amounted to a public acknowledgement that Trump ""was not under investigation in any Russian probe.''

""The President feels completely and totally vindicated,'' Trump attorney Marc Kasowitz said in a written statement. ""He is eager to continue to move forward with his agenda.''

Still, Comey's written statement is more than a simple recounting of conversations with Trump. It is remarkable for its detail, describing furnishings in the rooms where they met, their seating arrangements and their often wide-ranging discussions by telephone.

In one of his six telephone contacts with the president, Comey said Trump called him directly at FBI headquarters March 30 and described the ongoing Russia investigation as ""a cloud'' that was impairing the president's ability to lead the country.

""He said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia,'' Comey wrote, referring to the sexually-charged contents of an unsubstantiated dossier that purported to link Trump to the Kremlin.

""He asked what we could do to 'lift the cloud.' I responded that we were investigating the matter as quickly as we could, and that there would be great benefit, if we didn't find anything, to our having done the work well. He agreed, but then re-emphasized the problems this (investigation) was causing him.''

Toward the end of the extraordinary conversation, Comey said that Trump again stressed that the ''cloud'' of the Russia investigation was interfering with his ability to govern.

""He hoped that I could find a way to get out that he wasn't being investigated,'' Comey wrote. ""I told him I would see what we could do, and that we would do our investigative work well and as quickly as we could.""

Immediately after that March 30 call, Comey said he reported the conversation to then-acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente. Attorney General Jeff Sessions had earlier recused himself from considering all Russia-related matters because he had failed to disclose his own previous contacts with the Russian ambassador during his January confirmation hearing.

""I did not hear back from him before the president called me again two weeks later'' to ask what Comey had done to ""get out'' the word that Trump was ""not personally under investigation.''

Comey said he ultimately told Trump to pursue that information through Boente's office, ""which was the traditional channel'' for contacts between the White House and the FBI.

The director's encounters with Trump were so unusual and often uncomfortable, that Comey started memorializing the communications in memos, starting with his first Jan. 6 meeting at Trump Tower in Manhattan where the director briefed the president-elect on the contents of an unsubstantiated and sexually-charged dossier purporting to link Trump to the Kremlin.

""I felt compelled to document my first conversation with the president-elect in a memo,'' Comey wrote, adding that he began to compose it ""on a laptop in an FBI vehicle outside Trump Tower the moment I walked out of the meeting.

Creating written records of immediately after one-on-one conversations with Mr. Trump was my practice from that point forward. This had not been my practice in the past.''

Spokespeople for the FBI and the inspector general declined to comment Friday.

The New York Times and the Post have reported that the investigation is expected to find mistakes by lower-level officials within the FBI but will not accuse senior leaders of being motivated by political bias.

FBI Director Chris Wray has told Congress that he did not consider the FBI surveillance to be ""spying"" and that he has no evidence the FBI illegally monitored Trump's campaign during the 2016 election. Wray said he would not describe the FBI's surveillance as ""spying"" if it's following ""investigative policies and procedures.""

Attorney General William Barr has said he believed ""spying"" did occur, but he also made clear at a Senate hearing earlier this year that he had no specific evidence that any surveillance was illegal or improper. Barr has appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham to investigate how intelligence was collected, and that probe has since become criminal in nature, a person familiar with the matter has said.

But Trump insists that members of the Obama administration “at the highest levels” were spying on his 2016 campaign. “Personally, I think it goes all the way. ...

Editor's Note: This story has been edited to make it clear that it is analysis and that the allegations of the Trump campaign conspiring with the Russians remain unproven.

This week in the Russia investigations: Michael Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison ... Maria Butina pleaded guilty ... but the finish line looks no closer

The shifting sands

Political and legal danger for President Trump may be sharpening by the day, but the case that his campaign might have conspired with the Russian attack on the 2016 election is still unproven despite two years of investigations, court filings and even numerous convictions and guilty pleas.

Trump has been implicated in ordering a scheme to silence two women ahead of Election Day in 2016 about the alleged sexual relationships they had with him years before.

That is a serious matter, or it might have been in other times, but this scheme is decidedly not a global conspiracy with a foreign power to steal the election.

More broadly, the president and his supporters say, the payments to the women in 2016 are penny ante stuff: Breaking campaign finance law, if that did take place, isn't like committing murder, said one lawyer for the president.

The ""biased"" Justice Department is just grasping at straws to use something against Trump because it hasn't been able to locate a ""smocking gun,"" as Trump wrote this week, that would tie his campaign in with Russia's active measures in 2016.

There's an important kernel of truth in that argument — not only is there no smoking gun, but the Russia case also appears to have been weakening, not strengthening, while America's eyes have been on the payments.

The charges they didn't make

Item: Cohen ostensibly played a key role in the version of events told by the infamous, partly unverified Russia dossier. He denied that strongly to Congress. He also has admitted lying to Congress and submitted an important new version of other events.

But that new story didn't include a trip to Prague, as described in the dossier. Nor did Cohen discuss that in his interview on Friday on ABC News. Could the trip, or a trip, still be substantiated? Yes, maybe — but if it happened, would a man go to prison for three years without anyone having mentioned it?

Item: Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, is on track to be sentenced early next year after his conviction in the Eastern District of Virginia and his guilty plea in Washington, D.C.

Prosecutors say that Manafort shouldn't get any consideration for the information he has given the feds because he has been lying to them; Manafort's lawyers say he gave the government valuable information.

Nonetheless, the crimes for which the feds want Manafort to be locked up aren't a Russian conspiracy to throw the election.

Moreover, Manafort took part in at least one event that has attracted endless discussion: the June 2016 meeting at which he and other top campaign leaders hosted the delegation of Russians following an offer of dirt on Hillary Clinton.

But Manafort's role in that meeting hasn't figured into either of his federal cases nor been the subject of court documents. Maybe the feds are holding all that back for some kind of big reveal — or maybe there's no conspiracy here.

Further inference: If Manafort isn't in any legal jeopardy over his role in the Trump Tower meeting, does that suggest no one else is, either? There were a lot of outside theories that the meeting might have broken federal laws barring U.S. political campaigns from getting opposition research from foreigners.

Does the absence of anything about that in Manafort's case mean the feds actually don't think there's anything to prosecute?

Item: Former national security adviser Michael Flynn has been a very good witness, the feds say. They say it would be fine with them if, when he is sentenced on Tuesday, a judge gave Flynn no jail time.

Does that sound like the attitude they would take with someone who had been serving as a Russian factotum and who had been serving as a foreign agent from inside the White House as national security adviser, steps away from the Oval Office?

And on it goes: Will the feds ever charge Trump's sometime foreign policy adviser, Carter Page, whom they called a Russian agent in the partly declassified application they made to surveil him?

The surveillance began under FBI Director James Comey and was reauthorized into the Trump era, including by his own appointees at the Justice Department.

That suggests it was yielding foreign intelligence, but Page has maintained all along that he did nothing wrong. Judging by the absence of any charges and his continued liberty, authorities appear to agree.

Shadows and fog

Investigators certainly know more than they're saying — they often repeat as much in court appearances and documents in their various cases. But an ostensible conspiracy between Trump's campaign and the Russians who attacked the election is nowhere near close to being proven.

Not only that, a few recent events may delay the verification of any official theory about such a conspiracy. One important one is that Trump has signaled that he's open to clemency for people in the Russia imbroglio.

If Manafort and others take that as a beacon of hope to stand fast against the feds and fight their cases because they'll ultimately get a pardon, that could not only add months to this saga but also conceal important facts.

Mueller, as usual, is in the driver's seat. If he presses ahead with criminal cases against people who don't accept plea deals, the Russia imbroglio could run well into 2019 or beyond.

If he opts not to prosecute people on whom he has evidence of wrongdoing and he simply writes what he's discovered in a notional final report, this saga might end sooner but amount to an abdication of justice. That doesn't seem like the Mueller that America has come to know.

Another thing that Americans have come to know about Mueller is that he can keep a secret. So if he has evidence about a geopolitical conspiracy between Trump's campaign and Russia's active measures, the public probably won't learn about it until the moment the special counsel's office wants that to happen.

From what is visible today, however, the case is still Swiss cheese. Unless that changes in a big way, the hottest political story in a generation may lose its place in center stage.

The continued slide of the core Russia ""collusion"" story, if that is what indeed happens, is politically relevant to the other investigations and potential problems confronting the president.

Because the hush money payments and the potential international contributions to the inauguration campaign aren't about Russia, it provides a talking point to the White House:

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – FBI Agent Peter Strzok, who exchanged anti-Trump text messages with his co-worker girlfriend, said Thursday that his political beliefs never affected his work on the Russia or Hillary Clinton investigations.

""Let me be clear, unequivocally and under oath: Not once in my 26 years of defending our nation did my personal opinions impact any official action I took,"" Strzok testified before two House committees.

""This is true for the Clinton email investigation, for the investigation into Russian interference and for every other investigation I’ve worked on,"" Strzok said in a chamber packed with a standing-room-only crowd. ""It is not who I am, and it is not something I would ever do. Period.""

Strzok helped lead the investigations into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election and into Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. He was removed from the Russia inquiry by special counsel Robert Mueller last summer when Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz discovered texts between Strzok and former FBI attorney Lisa Page disparaging then-candidate Donald Trump in 2016.

Republicans used Thursday's hearing to underscore their charges of bias by the FBI and Department of Justice against Trump and in favor of Clinton. Strzok denied that he was part of any conspiracy to go after Trump, and Democrats backed him.

Democrats charged that Republicans were trying to undermine Mueller's investigation of possible collusion between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign. Republicans want Mueller's inquiry to end before the midterm elections in November. Democrats say Mueller should not be pressured to end his investigation prematurely.

Strzok said he never revealed information about the Russia investigation that could have damaged Trump's campaign.

""There is ... one extraordinarily important piece of evidence supporting my integrity, the integrity of the FBI and our lack of bias,"" Strzok said. ""In the summer of 2016, I was one of a handful of people who knew the details of Russian election interference and its possible connections with members of the Trump campaign. This information had the potential to derail, and quite possibly defeat, Mr. Trump. But the thought of exposing that information never crossed my mind.""'

Hostile questioning

Strzok faced hostile Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, who pointed to his text messages with Page in 2015 and 2016 as evidence of bias in the Russia and Clinton investigations. Strzok and Page were having an extramarital affair at the time they were texting.

Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, brought up the affair during one of the most heated parts of the hearing, asking Strzok whether he gave his wife the same ""innocent"" look he was giving Congress members.

Democrats shouted Gohmert down as Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J., yelled ""you need your medication.""

Strzok angrily replied that Gohmert's question ""goes more to a discussion about your character.""

""The fact that you would question whether or not that was the sort of look I would engage with at a family member that I have acknowledged hurting goes more to a discussion about your character and what you stand for and what is going on inside you,"" Strzok said.

Strzok said he criticized Clinton, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and others in the text messages as well as Trump. In response to a question from Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, Strzok conceded that it was ""fair to say"" that he and Page detested Trump and supported Clinton.

He acknowledged that his testimony was unlikely to satisfy his critics.

""After all, Americans are skeptical of anything coming out of Washington,"" Strzok said. ""But the fact is, after months of investigations, there is simply no evidence of bias in my professional actions.""

Strzok was subpoenaed last week by the House Judiciary Committee to testify publicly about the text messages he exchanged with Page.

In a report to Congress released last month, Horowitz said Page wrote to Strzok in a text message, ""(Trump's) not ever going to become president, right?"" In response, Strzok wrote, ""No. No he's not. We'll stop it.""

Angry about Khan treatment

Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., pressed Strzok to explain that exchange Thursday.

Strzok said he wrote the text ""late at night, off the cuff."" He said he was angry that candidate Trump ""insulted"" the family of Humayun Khan, a Muslim American soldier killed by a suicide bomber in Iraq.

Khan's father, Khizr, criticized Trump's proposed ban on Muslim immigrants at the Democratic National Convention in 2016. Trump responded by questioning whether Khizr Khan’s wife, Ghazala, was allowed to speak on stage as a Muslim woman.

Strzok said he thought Trump's behavior was ""horrible and disgusting"" and he believed Americans would reject the candidate because of it.

""It was in no way that me or the FBI would take any action to improperly impact the electoral process for any candidate,"" Strzok said of his text message.

In his report, Horowitz found no evidence that the FBI or DOJ were motivated by political bias in deciding not to prosecute Clinton for using a private email server to send and receive sensitive information. The report said Strzok repeatedly pushed for more aggressive action in the Clinton investigation.

Page has left the bureau. Strzok is still employed with the FBI but was escorted from FBI headquarters in June, so his personnel case could be reviewed. He is the FBI's deputy assistant director in the Human Relations Department. He previously served as deputy assistant director of the counterintelligence division.

Page agrees to testify

The same committees questioning Strzok subpoenaed Page and threatened her with contempt of Congress when she declined to testify in a closed hearing Wednesday.

After Thursday's hearing began, Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., announced that the committee had reached an agreement with Page for her to be interviewed by lawmakers Friday and Monday in closed sessions. There will be a transcript of her testimony, but Goodlatte did not say whether that transcript would be made public.

Strzok answered 11 hours of questions from committee members during a closed hearing late last month, and he was angered by selective leaks of his testimony by lawmakers.

Strzok was on Trump's mind Wednesday night while the president was in Brussels for a NATO meeting.

""How can the Rigged Witch Hunt proceed when it was started, influenced and worked on, for an extended period of time, by former FBI Agent/Lover Peter Strzok?"" Trump tweeted. ""Read his hate filled and totally biased Emails and the answer is clear!""

Strzok said Russian interference in the 2016 election ""was a grave attack on our democracy"" and not a ""witch hunt"" as Trump has repeatedly alleged.

""Most disturbingly, it has been wildly successful – sowing discord in our nation and shaking faith in our institutions,"" Strzok said.""I have the utmost respect for Congress’s oversight role, but I truly believe that today’s hearing is just another victory notch in (Russian President Vladimir) Putin’s belt and another milestone in our enemies’ campaign to tear America apart.""

According to an interview transcript given to ███ , provided by an intermediary who spoke to two federal agents with the bureau last Friday , agents are frustrated by Comey ’ s leadership .
“ This is a textbook case where a grand jury should have convened but was not . That is appalling , ” an FBI special agent who has worked public corruption and criminal cases said of the decision . “ We talk about it in the office and don ’ t know how Comey can keep going . ”
The agent was also surprised that the bureau did not bother to search Clinton ’ s house during the investigation .
“ We didn ’ t search their house . We always search the house . The search should not just have been for private electronics , which contained classified material , but even for printouts of such material , ” he said .
“ There should have been a complete search of their residence , ” the agent pointed out . “ That the FBI did not seize devices is unbelievable . The FBI even seizes devices that have been set on fire . ”
Another special agent for the bureau that worked counter-terrorism and criminal cases said he is offended by Comey ’ s saying : “ we ” and “ I ’ ve been an investigator . ”
After graduating from law school , Comey became a law clerk to a U.S. District Judge in Manhattan and later became an associate in a law firm in the city .
Upon Bush ’ s exit from the White House , Comey entered the private sector and became general counsel and Senior Vice President for Lockheed Martin , among other private sector posts . President Barack Obama appointed him to FBI director in 2013 replacing out going-director Robert Mueller .
“ Comey was never an investigator or special agent . The special agents are trained investigators and they are insulted that Comey included them in ‘ collective we ’ statements in his testimony to imply that the SAs agreed that there was nothing there to prosecute , ” the second agent said . “ All the trained investigators agree that there is a lot to prosecuted but he stood in the way . ”
He added , “ The idea that [ the Clinton e-mail case ] didn ’ t go to a grand jury is ridiculous . ”
According to Washington D.C. attorney Joe DiGenova , more FBI agents will be talking about the problems at the bureau . DiGenova notes the agents will specifically point to the handling of the Clinton case by Comey when Congress comes back into session and decides to force them to testify by subpoena .
DiGenova told WMAL radio ’ s Drive at Five last week , “ People are starting to talk . They ’ re calling their former friends outside the bureau asking for help . We were asked to day to provide legal representation to people inside the bureau and agreed to do so and to former agents who want to come forward and talk . Comey thought this was going to go away . ”
He explained , “ It ’ s not . People inside the bureau are furious . They are embarrassed . They feel like they are being led by a hack but more than that that they think he ’ s a crook . They think he ’ s fundamentally dishonest . They have no confidence in him . The bureau inside right now is a mess . ”

fbi,Fox Online News,2,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/flynn-evidence-calls-into-question-statements-by-former-special-counsel-brandon-van-grack,Flynn bombshells cast doubt on Mueller prosecutor Brandon Van Grack's compliance with court order,,Gregg Re,"Explosive , newly unsealed evidence documenting the FBI 's efforts to target national security adviser Michael Flynn -- including a top official 's handwritten memo debating whether the FBI 's `` goal '' was `` to get him to lie , so we can prosecute him or get him fired '' -- calls into question whether Brandon Van Grack , a Justice Department prosecutor and former member of Special Counsel Robert Mueller 's Team , complied with a court order to produce favorable evidence to Flynn .
Since February 2018 , Van Grack has been obligated to comply with D.C. District Court Judge Emmet G. Sullivan 's standing order in the Flynn case to produce all evidence in the government ’ s possession “ that is favorable to defendant and material either to defendant ’ s guilt or punishment . ”
The order also requires the government to submit favorable defense evidence to the court , including possible `` impeachment evidence '' that could undermine witnesses , even if the government believes the evidence “ not to be material . ”
WHO IS JOE PIENTKA , MYSTERY FBI AGENT AT CENTER OF FLYNN AND CARTER PAGE CASES ? ... FBI SCRUBS HIM FROM WEBSITE
Van Grack has long informed Sullivan that the government ’ s so-called `` Brady '' obligations , referring to prosecutors ' duty to turn over exculpatory materials to defendants , have been met . In an October 2019 filing , Van Grack denied governmental misconduct and assured the court that the government “ has complied , and will continue to comply , with its discovery and disclosure obligations , including those imposed pursuant to Brady and the Court ’ s Standing Order . ”
In that same October 2019 motion , Van Grack elaborated on those claims , telling Sullivan that the government had not “ affirmatively suppressed evidence ” or hid Brady material . He denied that government was “ aware of any information that would be favorable and material to [ Flynn ] at sentencing . ”
Van Grack further dismissed arguments by Flynn 's attorney , Sidney Powell , that “ General Flynn was targeted and taken out of the Trump administration for concocted and political purposes ” as “ conspiracy theories . ”
DOJ regulations state that prosecutors like Van Grack , `` with limited exceptions ... should be granted access [ by FBI agents ] to the substantive case file and any other file or document '' that they `` have reason to believe may contain discoverable information related to the matter being prosecuted . '' The regulations state that prosecutors can `` personally review the file or documents or may choose to request production of potentially discoverable materials from the case agents . ''
What Van Grack didn ’ t inform the court about – and didn ’ t provide to Flynn – was the newly unsealed January 4 , 2017 `` Closing Communication '' from the FBI Washington Field Office , which recommended the FBI close its investigation of Flynn , as its exhaustive search through government databases “ did not yield any information on which to predicate further investigative efforts . ''
Van Grack also failed to provide evidence to Flynn ’ s attorneys that anti-Trump former FBI agent Peter Strzok then immediately intervened and instructed the FBI case manager handling the Flynn investigation to keep the probe open , followed by indicators that the bureau would seek to investigate Flynn for possible violations of an obscure 18th century law known as the Logan Act -- which has never been utilized in a modern prosecution .
Another Strzok text mentions that the FBI ’ s `` 7th floor '' – meaning FBI leadership – may have been involved in the decision to keep the Flynn case alive .
Instead , Van Grack characterized Flynn ’ s alleged false statements as critical to the FBI ’ s “ legitimate and significant investigation into whether individuals associated with the campaign of then-candidate Donald J. Trump were coordinating with the Russian government in its activities to interfere with the 2016 presidential election . ”
HOROWITZ REPORT MAY INADVERTENTLY REVEAL PIENTKA 'S ROLE IN PAGE , FLYNN MATTERS
He argued to Sullivan that Flynn ’ s “ conduct and communications with Russia went to the heart of that inquiry. ” And Van Grack said that Flynn ’ s alleged “ false statements to the FBI on January 24 , 2017 , were absolutely material . ”
But by that time , the FBI had already cleared Flynn of any improper ties , coordination , or communication with Russia . Just a day before Flynn 's January 2017 White House interview , the Washington Post ran a story declaring that the FBI `` had reviewed Flynn ’ s calls with Russian ambassador but found nothing illicit , '' citing unnamed `` U.S . officials . ''
Shedding light on internal FBI deliberations , notes from the then-assistant director of the FBI ’ s Counterintelligence Division Bill Priestap -- written before the Flynn interview and after discussions with then-FBI Director James Comey and then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe , Fox News is told -- show discussions of whether their “ goal ” at the White House interview was “ to get him to lie , so we can prosecute him or get him fired . ”
These unsealed notes further suggest that agents planned in the alternative to get Flynn “ to admit to breaking the Logan Act ” when he spoke to then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition period .
The Logan Act has never been used in a modern criminal prosecution and has a questionable constitutional status ; it was enacted in 1799 in an era before telephones and was intended to prevent individuals from falsely claiming to represent the United States government abroad .
`` Any criminal investigation grounded in Logan Act questions is an obvious political pretext to attack the Trump Administration , '' GOP Reps. Jim Jordan and Mike Johnson wrote to FBI Director Christopher Wray on Monday , in a letter seeking in-person interviews and key documents . `` FBI attorney Lisa Page admitted to Congress the Justice Department saw the Logan Act as an 'untested ' and 'very , very old ' statute . ''
This new evidence puts Van Grack at risk for accusations that he was misleading Sullivan as to the materiality of Flynn ’ s statements to FBI agents Strzok and Joe Pientka when they interviewed him in the White House on January 24 , 2017 .
Jordan and Johnson are now specifically seeking to question Pientka , who participated in the January 2017 White House interview that led to Flynn 's prosecution .
Fox News has previously determined that Pientka was also intimately involved in the probe of former Trump aide Carter Page , which the DOJ has since acknowledged was riddled with fundamental errors and premised on a discredited dossier that the bureau was told could be part of a Russian disinformation campaign .
Pientka was conspicuously removed from the FBI 's website after Fox News contacted the FBI about his extensive role in Crossfire Hurricane Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) matters -- a change first noticed by Twitter user Techno Fog -- but sources say Pientka remains in a senior role at the agency 's San Francisco field office .
BOMBSHELL FBI MATERIALS REVEAL FBI DISCUSSED INTERVIEWING FLYNN TO GET HIM TO LIE , GET HIM FIRED
The FBI , speaking to Fox News last December , asserted that reporting on Pientka 's identity would potentially endanger his life and would serve no legitimate journalistic purpose . Republicans have previously sought to question Pientka , however , beginning in 2018 . On Monday , the FBI declined to provide any additional comment .
For an individual to be prosecuted for a false statement offense under federal law , the lie must be “ material. ” The newly revealed materials strongly suggest the FBI wasn ’ t truly concerned about Flynn ’ s call with Kislyak during the presidential transition period . If the questioning of Flynn by Strzok and Pientka were based on a pretext , that revelation would arguably defeat any assertion that Flynn ’ s purported lies were material .
Other reports of edited information and a secret agreement may put the issues surrounding the compliance with Sullivan ’ s standing order into context .
FBI HAD INDICATORS THAT STEELE DOSSIER WAS RUSSIAN DISINFORMATION OPERATION
For example , the Mueller Report omitted key parts of a voicemail from Trump lawyer John Dowd to Flynn ’ s former lawyers discussing a joint defense agreement and the exchange of information .
Additionally , the release of emails from Flynn ’ s former attorneys at Covington & Burling revealed the existence of “ a lawyers unofficial understanding that they are unlikely to charge [ Michael Flynn Jr. ] in light of the [ Flynn ’ s ] Cooperation Agreement . ”
Per Flynn 's former lawyers , this served to `` limit '' what the government `` have to disclose '' to any defendant against whom Flynn would have to testify .
That arrangement is contrary to the stated terms of the November 30 , 2017 plea offer signed by Van Grack , Flynn , and his lawyers , which represents that there were no other “ agreements , promises , or understandings ” between the special counsel ’ s office and Flynn .
Andrew McCarthy , a former federal prosecutor and Fox News contributor , has noted : “ [ F ] ederal law requires all terms of a plea agreement to be disclosed to the court ; prosecutors are not at liberty to obscure plea terms because they are embarrassed or tactically harmed by having agreed to them . ”
The dispute over the government ’ s compliance with Sullivan ’ s standing order may bolster Flynn ’ s efforts to withdraw his plea or , ultimately , have the case dismissed due to government misconduct . Flynn , who has said more recently that he did not lie to the FBI , pleaded guilty in late 2017 as mounting legal fees pushed him to sell his home .
Prosecutors have suggested Flynn 's guilty plea allowed him to escape liability for a possible charge under the Foreign Agents Registration Act ( FARA ) , another little-known and once-rarely used law , for his alleged work in Turkey .
Powell has stated that she expects more evidence to be produced soon , and has implied the FBI does n't even have any proof Flynn discussed the Obama administration 's sanctions with Russia 's ambassador . `` No lawyer for @ GenFlynn has heard the recording or seen the transcript [ of Flynn 's intercepted calls with the ambassador ] , '' Powell wrote on Twitter on Sunday . `` I bet $ 1000 there is no mention of 'sanctions . ' ''
During the White House interview , Flynn told the agents `` not really '' when asked if he had sought to convince Kislyak not to escalate a brewing fight with the U.S. over sanctions imposed by the Obama administration , according to a FD-302 witness report prepared by the FBI that has been disputed by Flynn 's defense team . Flynn also reportedly demurred when asked if he had asked Russia to veto a U.N. Security Council resolution that condemned Israel ’ s settlements in the West Bank , the FBI claimed . ( The Obama administration abstained in that vote . )
According to the FBI 's 302 , Flynn issued other apparently equivocal responses to FBI agents ' questions , and at various points suggested that such conversations might have happened or that he could not recall them if they did . Flynn 's team has indicated he was concerned that the agents interviewing him , including Strzok and the lower-level Pientka , may have lacked the necessary security clearance to discuss sensitive foreign policy matters .
Meanwhile , Van Grack ’ s name has been absent from the government ’ s latest court filings and they have yet to respond to Flynn ’ s latest motion to dismiss .
After this article was published , the FBI provided a statement to Fox News saying that under Wray , the bureau had turned over relevant Flynn materials to the U.S. attorney probing possible FBI criminal misconduct during the Trump probe , John Durham -- but the FBI did n't say when exactly the handoff happened .
“ Under Director Wray ’ s leadership , the FBI has fully cooperated and been transparent with the review being conducted by U.S. Attorney Jeff Jensen , just as it has been with U.S. Attorney John Durham and was with Inspector General Michael Horowitz , '' the statement read .
The FBI continued : `` With regard to certain documents in the Michael Flynn matter from the 2016-2017 time period that are now the subject of reporting by the press , the FBI previously produced those materials to the Inspector General and U.S. Attorney Durham . The Flynn investigation was initiated and conducted during this time period , under prior FBI leadership . Since taking office , Director Wray has stressed the importance of strictly abiding by established processes , without exception . Director Wray remains firmly committed to addressing the failures under prior FBI leadership while maintaining the foundational principles of rigor , objectivity , accountability , and ownership in fulfilling the Bureau ’ s mission to protect the American people and defend the Constitution . ”
Late Tuesday , the DOJ told Flynn 's team that it was turning over even more potentially exculpatory evidence that was `` obtained and analyzed by USA EDMO [ Eastern District of Missouri ] in March , April and May 2020 . '' The precise nature of those materials was not immediately clear -- nor was it apparent why prosecutors in the Eastern District of Missouri were finally turning over the documents now .

fbi,BBC News,1,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50178197,Mueller report: Criminal probe into Russia inquiry begins,,,"The US justice department has launched a criminal investigation into the origins of the Mueller inquiry .
An administrative review into the special counsel 's investigation of 2016 election interference began in May .
But the switch to a criminal probe means investigators can now issue subpoenas for testimony and documents .
The investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election did not establish any criminal conspiracy between Moscow and the Trump campaign .
But it did not clear the president of obstructing justice . President Donald Trump has long dismissed Robert Mueller 's investigation as a `` witch hunt '' .
Reports of the justice department 's new criminal inquiry first appeared in the New York Times . It is unclear what potential crime is under investigation , the newspaper said .
The administrative review of the Mueller investigation began in May . It is being overseen by US Attorney General William Barr and is run by US federal prosecutor John Durham .
Mr Durham will have the power to summon witnesses and documents and to enrol a grand jury that could bring criminal charges .
He was tasked with determining whether the collection of intelligence on the Trump campaign in 2016 was lawful .
Mr Durham is widely respected and known for investigating links between FBI agents and organised crime , and investigating the destruction of CIA interrogation videos .
Last April , Mr Barr told members of Congress that he believed `` spying did occur '' on the Trump campaign in 2016 , adding : `` The question is whether it was adequately predicated . And I 'm not suggesting that it was n't adequately predicated . But I need to explore that . ''
Critics accused Mr Barr of launching an administrative review more in the interests of the president than the interests of justice .
In a joint statement , the chairs of the House judiciary and intelligence committees said reports of a criminal investigation `` raise profound new concerns that the Department of Justice under AG Barr has lost its independence and become a vehicle for President Trump 's political revenge '' .
The two Democrats , Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff , said the move could bring `` new and irreparable damage '' to the rule of law .
President Trump said at the time he did not order Mr Barr to launch the administrative review , but added that he was `` so proud of our attorney general '' and it was `` a great thing that he did '' .
Mr Trump has previously accused the FBI investigators who first launched the probe into his election campaign of treason .
On Friday , Mr Trump told reporters of the investigation : `` I think you 're going to see a lot of really bad things . ''
The president said he would `` leave it all up to the attorney general '' .
`` I will say this ... this was the worst hoax in the history of our country . ''
So far , the justice department has not made clear what potential crime is under investigation .
It is also unclear why this investigation has started now , or what prompted it .
And given the department itself appointed Robert Mueller to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election , this criminal probe means the department may be in essence investigating itself .
The 448-page Mueller report did not conclude that there was a criminal conspiracy between Moscow and the Trump campaign to influence the 2016 US presidential election .
However , it did detail 10 instances where Mr Trump possibly attempted to impede the investigation .
The report concluded that Russia had interfered in the election `` in sweeping and systematic fashion '' .
That interference took the form of an extensive social media campaign and the hacking of Democratic Party servers by Russian military intelligence , the report said .","Image copyright Reuters Image caption William Barr's review of the Muller Inquiry has turned into a criminal investigation

The US justice department has launched a criminal investigation into the origins of the Mueller inquiry.

An administrative review into the special counsel's investigation of 2016 election interference began in May.

But the switch to a criminal probe means investigators can now issue subpoenas for testimony and documents.

The investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election did not establish any criminal conspiracy between Moscow and the Trump campaign.

But it did not clear the president of obstructing justice. President Donald Trump has long dismissed Robert Mueller's investigation as a ""witch hunt"".

Reports of the justice department's new criminal inquiry first appeared in the New York Times. It is unclear what potential crime is under investigation, the newspaper said.

Why is the Mueller report being investigated?

The administrative review of the Mueller investigation began in May. It is being overseen by US Attorney General William Barr and is run by US federal prosecutor John Durham.

Mr Durham will have the power to summon witnesses and documents and to enrol a grand jury that could bring criminal charges.

He was tasked with determining whether the collection of intelligence on the Trump campaign in 2016 was lawful.

Mr Durham is widely respected and known for investigating links between FBI agents and organised crime, and investigating the destruction of CIA interrogation videos.

Last April, Mr Barr told members of Congress that he believed ""spying did occur"" on the Trump campaign in 2016, adding: ""The question is whether it was adequately predicated. And I'm not suggesting that it wasn't adequately predicated. But I need to explore that.""

Critics accused Mr Barr of launching an administrative review more in the interests of the president than the interests of justice.

In a joint statement, the chairs of the House judiciary and intelligence committees said reports of a criminal investigation ""raise profound new concerns that the Department of Justice under AG Barr has lost its independence and become a vehicle for President Trump's political revenge"".

The two Democrats, Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff, said the move could bring ""new and irreparable damage"" to the rule of law.

President Trump said at the time he did not order Mr Barr to launch the administrative review, but added that he was ""so proud of our attorney general"" and it was ""a great thing that he did"".

Mr Trump has previously accused the FBI investigators who first launched the probe into his election campaign of treason.

On Friday, Mr Trump told reporters of the investigation: ""I think you're going to see a lot of really bad things.""

The president said he would ""leave it all up to the attorney general"".

""I will say this...this was the worst hoax in the history of our country.""

What don't we know?

So far, the justice department has not made clear what potential crime is under investigation.

It is also unclear why this investigation has started now, or what prompted it.

And given the department itself appointed Robert Mueller to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election, this criminal probe means the department may be in essence investigating itself.

What's the Mueller report?

The 448-page Mueller report did not conclude that there was a criminal conspiracy between Moscow and the Trump campaign to influence the 2016 US presidential election.

However, it did detail 10 instances where Mr Trump possibly attempted to impede the investigation.

The report concluded that Russia had interfered in the election ""in sweeping and systematic fashion"".

That interference took the form of an extensive social media campaign and the hacking of Democratic Party servers by Russian military intelligence, the report said.

Comey pulled aside three of the bureau ’ s top officials for private chats . In calm tones , he told each of them about a private Oval Office meeting with President Trump — during which , Comey alleged , the president pressed him to shut down the federal criminal investigation of Trump ’ s then-national security adviser , Michael Flynn .
Those three officials , according to two people with detailed , firsthand knowledge of the matter , were Jim Rybicki , Comey ’ s chief of staff and senior counselor ; James Baker , the FBI ’ s general counsel ; and Andrew McCabe , then the bureau ’ s deputy director , and now the acting director , following Trump ’ s firing of Comey last month . Comey spoke to them within two days of his Oval conversation with Trump , the sources said , and recounted the president ’ s comments about the Flynn investigation .

Central to the special counsel ’ s investigation will be whether Trump , in allegedly attempting to interfere with the Russia investigation , acted within the law or crossed the line and engaged in obstruction of justice .
The three officials in question are all lawyers — and , likely , note takers
It is unclear whether each of the officials Comey told of the encounter took notes on their conversations with the director about Trump . But the FBI ’ s culture is one of creating contemporaneous notes and records , even on matters of far less importance . All three of the FBI officials are also lawyers , a profession known for its record keeping .
Rybicki has had a long career in both the US Department of Justice and FBI . At the Justice Department , he worked for the deputy attorney general , the National Security Division , the Office of Intelligence Policy and Review , and the United States Attorney ’ s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia , according to his official biography posted on the FBI ’ s website .
At both Justice and the FBI , he worked on both counterterrorism and counterintelligence matters , meaning that he was certainly read into the FBI ’ s investigations of whether the Trump campaign or administration officials colluded with Russia to interfere on Trump ’ s behalf to win a razor-thin election .
Baker , too , has national security experience . From 2001 to 2007 , he headed the Justice Department ’ s office that would later formally become the department ’ s National Security Division . An FBI press release about Baker ’ s appointment as FBI general counsel states that while in that position , Baker “ developed , coordinated , and implemented national security policy with regard to intelligence and counterintelligence matters for the department . ”
The press release went on to note that Baker “ provided the attorney general , the U.S. intelligence community , and the White House with legal and policy advice on a range of national security issues and conducted oversight of the intelligence community , including the FBI , on behalf of the attorney general . ”
One senior law enforcement official familiar with the matter said that Comey specifically sought legal advice from Baker about when and how to tell the DOJ about Trump pressing Comey to shut down the Russia probe . The same official said that Comey and Baker had more than one discussion about the matter , and that Baker almost certainly made extensive notes about those deliberations .
Both Comey and Baker sought the advice of Rybicki and McCabe as to whether to inform the Justice Department of Trump ’ s pressure of Comey to shut down the Russia probe , according to this same official .

McCabe was deputy director under Comey . When Trump fired Comey on May 9 , McCabe became the acting director of the FBI . A 20-year veteran of the bureau , McCabe began his career in the New York office , where he worked organized crime cases and was part of an FBI SWAT team .

McCabe has testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee that as deputy director , he had “ an oversight role over all of our FBI operational activity , including that [ the Russia ] investigation . ”
The Trump administration said at one time that McCabe also was one of a number of potential candidates it was considering to replace Comey . He no longer appears to be a top candidate for the job .

McCabe is scheduled to testify Wednesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee , along with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats , and National Security Director Adm. Mike Rogers , all one day prior to Comey ’ s hearing before the same senators .
Republican senators on the committee reportedly are poised to question McCabe as to why neither he nor Comey informed the Justice Department about President Trump ’ s efforts to shut down the Russia investigation . On Thursday , they plan to grill Comey on the matter as well . Republicans have indicated they will argue if Trump actually did anything potentially outside the law — yet Comey never informed anyone at the Justice Department about it — that would raise serious questions about Comey 's credibility as a potential witness against Trump .
It is unclear whether McCabe will answer questions on his private conversations with Comey about whether to tell the Justice Department about Trump ’ s alleged pressure of the former FBI director . The new special counsel might believe that such information is pertinent to his investigation , and it is possible that Mueller has asked McCabe not to discuss the issue .
Mueller , himself a former FBI director , may have a bias in believing the word of Comey and other FBI managers over that of Trump .

I quote him from memory : “ When it ’ s your time to go , they ’ ll send your best friend to do the job . He ’ ll come to you as a pal , get you all relaxed . Maybe drink with you , joke around , and then , while you ’ re laughing and having a good time and all — BAM ! — lights out ! You ’ ll never see it coming . ”
He knew what he was talking about . In fact , that was the script for any number of mob murders that I investigated . The victim ’ s killer always came to him as a friend .
I ’ ve been reflecting on this scenario ever since General Michael Flynn was charged with making a false statement to the FBI . Let me explain why .
Flynn , a decorated thirty year Army man , has pled guilty to the charge and is about to be sentenced by the court . But , despite Flynn ’ s guilty plea , a great deal of mystery surrounds his case . For , in the context of his decades of devotion to duty and honorable service to the country , the charges against him make no sense . Why did he do it ? How could it happen that this decent and courageous man would take this wrong turn so late in his otherwise exemplary life ? How was it that he became a criminal just as he was assuming his new role as President Trump ’ s National Security Adviser ?
The sentencing memorandum filed by his lawyers provides some of the answers to these questions , and they aren ’ t pretty . Don ’ t get me wrong . The information in the memorandum doesn ’ t reflect badly on the general . No , the recited facts present a stomach-churning account of James Comey ’ s FBI intentionally targeting and effectively destroying this decent man for base and nakedly partisan political purposes .
Recall that , as the president ’ s incoming National Security Adviser , Flynn had communicated on different occasions with the Russian ambassador to the United States . Even though these conversations were entirely legal and appropriate , they had — like every other electronic communication in this country — been intercepted , catalogued , and stored by our omniscient surveillance state .
We know now that these intercepts gave Comey ’ s FBI a predicate for the fatal interview that was the means by which Special Counsel Robert Mueller ’ s band of Hillary Clinton acolytes were able to ruin Flynn . At the direction of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe , virulently anti-Trump Special Agent Peter Strzok ( who later joined Team Mueller ) , and another agent were dispatched to the West Wing of the White House to question Flynn about these recorded calls .
As set forth in the defense sentencing memorandum , the FBI knew the “ exact words ” spoken by Flynn to the ambassador . In short , Comey and McCabe had no real investigative purpose in having Flynn questioned about his entirely legal , legitimate , and proper conversations with the ambassador . But law enforcement and national security formed no part of their agenda . They were on a mission to undermine Trump ’ s new administration by any means necessary , and the intercepts gave them a way to set a trap for the president ’ s National Security Adviser .
The following is taken verbatim from the defense sentencing memorandum which quotes from documents produced by the special counsel ’ s office pursuant to court order :
At 12:35 p.m. on January 24 , 2017 , the first Tuesday after the presidential inauguration , General Flynn received a phone call from then-Deputy Director of the FBI , Andrew McCabe , on a secure phone in his office in the West Wing . General Flynn had for many years been accustomed to working in cooperation with the FBI on matters of national security . He and Mr. McCabe briefly discussed a security training session the FBI had recently conducted at the White House before Mr. McCabe , by his own account , stated that he “ felt that we needed to have two of our agents sit down ” with General Flynn to talk about his communications with Russian representatives .
Mr. McCabe ’ s account states : “ I explained that I thought the quickest way to get this done was to have a conversation between [ General Flynn ] and the agents only . I further stated that if LTG Flynn wished to include anyone else in the meeting , like the White House Counsel for instance , that I would need to involve the Department of Justice . [ General Flynn ] stated that this would not be necessary and agreed to meet with the agents without any additional participants. ” Less than two hours later , at 2:15 p.m. , FBI Deputy Assistant Director Peter Strzok and a second FBI agent arrived at the White House to interview General Flynn . By the agents ’ account , General Flynn was “ relaxed and jocular ” and offered to give the agents “ a little tour ” of the area around his West Wing office . The agents did not provide General Flynn with a warning of the penalties for making a false statement under 18 U.S.C . § 1001 before , during , or after the interview . Prior to the FBI ’ s interview of General Flynn , Mr. McCabe and other FBI officials “ decided the agents would not warn Flynn that it was a crime to lie during an FBI interview because they wanted Flynn to be relaxed , and they were concerned that giving the warnings might adversely affect the rapport , ” one of the agents reported . Before the interview , FBI officials had also decided that , if “ Flynn said he did not remember something they knew he said , they would use the exact words Flynn used… to try to refresh his recollection . If Flynn still would not confirm what he said… they would not confront him or talk him through it. ” One of the agents reported that General Flynn was “ unguarded ” during the interview and “ clearly saw the FBI agents as allies. ” [ Emphasis added . ]
Got that ? Flynn was “ relaxed and jocular ” and the FBI wanted to keep him that way . McCabe sent Strzok to set a trap which , once sprung , would destroy Flynn ’ s life . But they didn ’ t want to warn Flynn that he was facing danger , that he had better choose his words carefully and think long and hard before he answered their questions . It was contrived to be just a friendly , low-key , unguarded , and relaxed chat among “ allies . ”
Uncle Al and La Cosa Nostra couldn ’ t have set it up better . This was right out of their playbook . The FBI went to Flynn as friends and then — BAM ! — they figuratively blew his brains out .
Now it ’ s one thing for mob hitmen to use this kind of soulless , underhanded treachery , but is it too much to ask that our FBI adhere to a slightly higher standard of conduct ? You know , something ethical and old-fashioned like letting Flynn know that his life and liberty were on the line if he happened not to answer Strzok ’ s questions to McCabe or Comey ’ s satisfaction ? Maybe even letting him know that they already knew the exact contents of the conversation about which he was being questioned ?
But none of that happened . Instead , concealing the real reason for the interview and posing as colleagues and allies , the McCabe and Strzok lulled Flynn into a false sense of security and led him down the primrose path to his destruction .
In its sentencing memorandum , the special counsel ’ s office has recommended non-incarceration based on Flynn ’ s cooperation . But , even without cooperating , under the federal sentencing guidelines he was never in danger of going to prison .
But for Flynn , like anyone targeted by the government , the process is the punishment . As a result of being arrested and charged , he has been bankrupted and forced to sell his home and possessions to pay legal fees as he tries to defend himself and his family . Under these circumstances , whether or not Flynn goes to prison , he and his family have been devastated .
Measured by the suffering and financial ruination of Flynn and his loved ones , James Comey , Andrew McCabe , Peter Strzok , and Team Mueller have amply achieved their purpose . By wantonly destroying this good and decent man , they have sent a warning to others who might wish to serve or support our duly elected president and have succeeded in intimidating anyone who would dare to act contrary to the wishes of the politicized , permanent , and immutable deep state cadre that controls the levers of governmental power .
So , where does this leave those of us who want our government staffed by honest and capable individuals ? With Flynn ’ s ambush as precedent , how are we to encourage serious people to make the sacrifice of entering government service ? Now that it is no longer safe for public servants to even talk to one another without first engaging legal counsel and conducting all communications through their lawyers , how are they to efficiently conduct the affairs of government ? In short , why would any sane person ever consider stepping into such a snake pit ?
Unfortunately for our fragile Republic , the sad , discouraging , appalling and self-evident answers to these and similar questions will be the enduring legacy of the coldly calculated and unwarranted destruction of General Michael Flynn by those who saw fit to use the almost limitless power of the federal government to further their political agenda .","Long ago, when my three wonderful daughters were in grade school, they regularly conversed over the telephone with a rather unique life coach.

Uncle Al not only provided intelligence about ongoing criminal activity, he also taught me many things about life inside the mob. One fascinating subject had to do with the mob’s best practices when it decided to kill one of its own. On this topic, he held the underworld equivalent of a Ph.D. and lectured me many times.

I quote him from memory: “When it’s your time to go, they’ll send your best friend to do the job. He’ll come to you as a pal, get you all relaxed. Maybe drink with you, joke around, and then, while you’re laughing and having a good time and all — BAM! — lights out! You’ll never see it coming.”

For, in the context of his decades of devotion to duty and honorable service to the country, the charges against him make no sense. Why did he do it? How could it happen that this decent and courageous man would take this wrong turn so late in his otherwise exemplary life? How was it that he became a criminal just as he was assuming his new role as President Trump’s National Security Adviser?

The sentencing memorandum filed by his lawyers provides some of the answers to these questions, and they aren’t pretty. Don’t get me wrong. The information in the memorandum doesn’t reflect badly on the general. No, the recited facts present a stomach-churning account of James Comey’s FBI intentionally targeting and effectively destroying this decent man for base and nakedly partisan political purposes.

Recall that, as the president’s incoming National Security Adviser, Flynn had communicated on different occasions with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Even though these conversations were entirely legal and appropriate, they had — like every other electronic communication in this country — been intercepted, catalogued, and stored by our omniscient surveillance state.

We know now that these intercepts gave Comey’s FBI a predicate for the fatal interview that was the means by which Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s band of Hillary Clinton acolytes were able to ruin Flynn. At the direction of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, virulently anti-Trump Special Agent Peter Strzok (who later joined Team Mueller), and another agent were dispatched to the West Wing of the White House to question Flynn about these recorded calls.

As set forth in the defense sentencing memorandum, the FBI knew the “exact words” spoken by Flynn to the ambassador. In short, Comey and McCabe had no real investigative purpose in having Flynn questioned about his entirely legal, legitimate, and proper conversations with the ambassador. But law enforcement and national security formed no part of their agenda. They were on a mission to undermine Trump’s new administration by any means necessary, and the intercepts gave them a way to set a trap for the president’s National Security Adviser.

The following is taken verbatim from the defense sentencing memorandum which quotes from documents produced by the special counsel’s office pursuant to court order:

At 12:35 p.m. on January 24, 2017, the first Tuesday after the presidential inauguration, General Flynn received a phone call from then-Deputy Director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe, on a secure phone in his office in the West Wing. General Flynn had for many years been accustomed to working in cooperation with the FBI on matters of national security. He and Mr. McCabe briefly discussed a security training session the FBI had recently conducted at the White House before Mr. McCabe, by his own account, stated that he “felt that we needed to have two of our agents sit down” with General Flynn to talk about his communications with Russian representatives.

Mr. McCabe’s account states: “I explained that I thought the quickest way to get this done was to have a conversation between [General Flynn] and the agents only. I further stated that if LTG Flynn wished to include anyone else in the meeting, like the White House Counsel for instance, that I would need to involve the Department of Justice. [General Flynn] stated that this would not be necessary and agreed to meet with the agents without any additional participants.” Less than two hours later, at 2:15 p.m., FBI Deputy Assistant Director Peter Strzok and a second FBI agent arrived at the White House to interview General Flynn. By the agents’ account, General Flynn was “relaxed and jocular” and offered to give the agents “a little tour” of the area around his West Wing office. The agents did not provide General Flynn with a warning of the penalties for making a false statement under 18 U.S.C. § 1001 before, during, or after the interview. Prior to the FBI’s interview of General Flynn, Mr. McCabe and other FBI officials “decided the agents would not warn Flynn that it was a crime to lie during an FBI interview because they wanted Flynn to be relaxed, and they were concerned that giving the warnings might adversely affect the rapport,” one of the agents reported. Before the interview, FBI officials had also decided that, if “Flynn said he did not remember something they knew he said, they would use the exact words Flynn used… to try to refresh his recollection. If Flynn still would not confirm what he said… they would not confront him or talk him through it.” One of the agents reported that General Flynn was “unguarded” during the interview and “clearly saw the FBI agents as allies.” [Emphasis added.]

Got that? Flynn was “relaxed and jocular” and the FBI wanted to keep him that way. McCabe sent Strzok to set a trap which, once sprung, would destroy Flynn’s life. But they didn’t want to warn Flynn that he was facing danger, that he had better choose his words carefully and think long and hard before he answered their questions. It was contrived to be just a friendly, low-key, unguarded, and relaxed chat among “allies.”

Uncle Al and La Cosa Nostra couldn’t have set it up better. This was right out of their playbook. The FBI went to Flynn as friends and then — BAM! — they figuratively blew his brains out.

Now it’s one thing for mob hitmen to use this kind of soulless, underhanded treachery, but is it too much to ask that our FBI adhere to a slightly higher standard of conduct? You know, something ethical and old-fashioned like letting Flynn know that his life and liberty were on the line if he happened not to answer Strzok’s questions to McCabe or Comey’s satisfaction? Maybe even letting him know that they already knew the exact contents of the conversation about which he was being questioned?

But none of that happened. Instead, concealing the real reason for the interview and posing as colleagues and allies, the McCabe and Strzok lulled Flynn into a false sense of security and led him down the primrose path to his destruction.

In its sentencing memorandum, the special counsel’s office has recommended non-incarceration based on Flynn’s cooperation. But, even without cooperating, under the federal sentencing guidelines he was never in danger of going to prison.

But for Flynn, like anyone targeted by the government, the process is the punishment. As a result of being arrested and charged, he has been bankrupted and forced to sell his home and possessions to pay legal fees as he tries to defend himself and his family. Under these circumstances, whether or not Flynn goes to prison, he and his family have been devastated.

Measured by the suffering and financial ruination of Flynn and his loved ones, James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, and Team Mueller have amply achieved their purpose. By wantonly destroying this good and decent man, they have sent a warning to others who might wish to serve or support our duly elected president and have succeeded in intimidating anyone who would dare to act contrary to the wishes of the politicized, permanent, and immutable deep state cadre that controls the levers of governmental power.

So, where does this leave those of us who want our government staffed by honest and capable individuals? With Flynn’s ambush as precedent, how are we to encourage serious people to make the sacrifice of entering government service? Now that it is no longer safe for public servants to even talk to one another without first engaging legal counsel and conducting all communications through their lawyers, how are they to efficiently conduct the affairs of government? In short, why would any sane person ever consider stepping into such a snake pit?

Unfortunately for our fragile Republic, the sad, discouraging, appalling and self-evident answers to these and similar questions will be the enduring legacy of the coldly calculated and unwarranted destruction of General Michael Flynn by those who saw fit to use the almost limitless power of the federal government to further their political agenda.

President Trump unloaded on both Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, hours after federal agents raided the office of Trump's longtime personal attorney Michael Cohen.

""It's a disgraceful situation. It's a total witch hunt,"" Trump said on Monday. ""When I saw this, when I heard about it, that is a whole new level of unfairness.""

It was not immediately clear why investigators targeted Cohen, but Cohen's lawyer said the raids followed a referral from Mueller. The New York Times, which first reported the raid, said that it does not appear as though the Cohen search was directly linked to the Russia investigation.

The Times and the Washington Post reported Cohen is under investigation for possible bank fraud.

Nonetheless, a visibly agitated Trump, speaking to reporters before he met with military and national security officials about the ongoing situation in Syria, put blame on Mueller and Sessions.

Trump called Mueller's team, which is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and any potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, ""the most biased group of people.""

""These people have the biggest conflicts of interest I have ever seen. Democrats — all. Either Democrats or a couple of Republicans who worked for President Obama,"" Trump said. Mueller is a Republican, and the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York was appointed in January.

As to whether he would fire Mueller, Trump gave his frequently used ""we'll see what happens"" response, reiterating that he believed that the investigation was ""a pure and simple witch hunt"" that should have been wrapped up long ago.

""Why don't I just fire Mueller? Well, I think it's a disgrace what's going on. We'll see what happens,"" Trump said.

The president went on to attack Sessions — his own appointee — for recusing himself from the Russia investigation in March 2017. The recusal put Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in charge of the probe, and he appointed Mueller in May.

""The attorney general made a terrible mistake when he did this and when [he] recused himself or he certainly should have let us know if he was going to recuse himself and we would have put a different attorney general in,"" Trump said. ""So he made what I consider to be a very terrible mistake for the country. But you'll figure that out.""

Cohen's attorney Stephen Ryan argued the FBI had overstepped its bounds in seizing ""privileged communications"" between Cohen and his clients.

""The decision by the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York to conduct their investigation using search warrants is completely inappropriate and unnecessary,"" Ryan said in a statement.

He continued: ""It resulted in the unnecessary seizure of protected attorney client communications between a lawyer and his clients. These government tactics are also wrong because Mr. Cohen has cooperated completely with all government entities, including providing thousands of non-privileged documents to the Congress and sitting for depositions under oath.""

Michael Moore, a former U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, told NPR that for investigators, ""the possibility of evidence destruction is likely at the forefront of their concern.""

""Remember that they are also gathering evidence and testimony from other sources, so they may already be in possession of corroborating evidence,"" Moore said. ""That's what makes this move in the investigation so interesting. For example, there is a reason that search warrants were issued for the particular locations.""

The FBI, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the special counsel's office declined to comment on the search.

Cohen has worked for Trump for many years and is closely tied in with many of his business and personal matters.

For example, Cohen has admitted he paid adult film actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 just weeks before the 2016 election. Daniels called that part of a concerted effort to stop her from going public about what she says was a 2006 tryst with Trump.

The president denies any liaison with Daniels and denies he knew about the payment. Trump told reporters on Air Force One recently to ask Cohen about it.

The president also said he didn't know where Cohen got the $130,000 to give to Daniels. Cohen has said he used his own ""personal funds.""

Cohen also was the point of contact between the Trump Organization and government officials in Russia at a time when Trump wanted to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.

Cohen acknowledged sending an email to Russian President Vladimir Putin's personal spokesman to ask about starting discussions about a major new real estate project in the Russian capital — discussions that Cohen said never got underway.",www.npr.org,center,FFBUzdepjLPyYESn

But recently , I did just that when I sat down with Lisa Page the week before Thanksgiving in my hotel room in Washington , D.C . Page , of course , is the former FBI lawyer whose text-message exchanges with agent Peter Strzok that belittled Donald Trump and expressed fear at his possible victory became international news . They were hijacked by Trump to fuel his “ deep state ” conspiracy .
For the nearly two years since her name first made the papers , she ’ s been publicly silent ( she did have a closed-door interview with House members in July 2018 ) . I asked her why she was willing to talk now . “ Honestly , his demeaning fake orgasm was really the straw that broke the camel ’ s back , ” she says . The president called out her name as he acted out an orgasm in front of thousands of people at a Minneapolis rally on Oct. 11 .
That was the moment Page decided she had to speak up . “ I had stayed quiet for years hoping it would fade away , but instead it got worse , ” she says . “ It had been so hard not to defend myself , to let people who hate me control the narrative . I decided to take my power back . ”
She is also about to be back in the news cycle in a big way . On Dec. 9 , the Justice Department inspector general report into Trump ’ s charges that the FBI spied on his 2016 campaign will come out . Leaked press accounts indicate the report will exonerate Page of the allegation that she acted unprofessionally or showed bias against Trump .
Page , 40 , is thin and athletic . She speaks in an exceedingly confident , clear , and lawyerly way . But having been through the MAGA meat grinder has clearly worn her down , not unlike the other women I ’ ve met who ’ ve been subjected to the president ’ s abuse . She is just slightly crumbly around the edges the way the president ’ s other victims are .
“ It ’ s almost impossible to describe ” what it ’ s like , she told me . “ It ’ s like being punched in the gut . My heart drops to my stomach when I realize he has tweeted about me again . The president of the United States is calling me names to the entire world . He ’ s demeaning me and my career . It ’ s sickening . ”
“ But it ’ s also very intimidating because he ’ s still the president of the United States . And when the president accuses you of treason by name , despite the fact that I know there ’ s no fathomable way that I have committed any crime at all , let alone treason , he ’ s still somebody in a position to actually do something about that . To try to further destroy my life . It never goes away or stops , even when he ’ s not publicly attacking me . ”
“ I wish it didn ’ t , ” she said . “ I ’ m someone who ’ s always in my head anyway—so now otherwise normal interactions take on a different meaning . Like , when somebody makes eye contact with me on the Metro , I kind of wince , wondering if it ’ s because they recognize me , or are they just scanning the train like people do ? It ’ s immediately a question of friend or foe ? Or if I ’ m walking down the street or shopping and there ’ s somebody wearing Trump gear or a MAGA hat , I ’ ll walk the other way or try to put some distance between us because I ’ m not looking for conflict . Really , what I wanted most in this world is my life back . ”
Lisa Page did not aspire to fame or fortune . She was , she says , “ one of those nerdy kids who from very early on knew I wanted work for the government and make the world a better place. ” Born in the San Fernando Valley , she and her family moved to Ohio in her teens . She went to American University in Washington , D.C. , and then moved back home to central Ohio to attend law school , living with her parents so she could save money .
After graduating from law school , she was one of an elite group selected for admission in the Department of Justice Honors Program in 2006—and the only woman in her class of five entering the Criminal Division . She worked as a federal prosecutor for six years before moving across the street to the FBI ’ s office of general counsel . Soon after her arrival , the deputy general counsel over national-security law hired her for a new special-counsel-type position in 2013 .
“ I start [ in the role ] in early 2013 , and there are two big events that kind of set the trajectory for the rest of my career at the FBI : the Boston bombing in April 2013 , and Edward Snowden ’ s leaks in June of the same year , ” she told me . “ And those are both significant in their own ways , because the Boston bombing introduces me to Andy McCabe , who at the time was the head of the counterterrorism division at the FBI . Two months later , the Snowden leaks hit , which became a transformative moment for the intelligence community , setting off a series of reforms by the Obama administration with respect to the legal authorities that we rely on to collect intelligence . ”
Eventually , she was asked to lead that effort , “ which gives me a lot of exposure to senior FBI executives , as well as leaders through the IC , DOJ , and White House . ”
Page continued to rise through the ranks of the FBI and was assigned to more significant and substantive work . She became close with McCabe . Eventually she became McCabe ’ s special counsel .
By February 2016 , she was working on one of the most important investigations at the FBI—the Hillary Clinton email case . “ We knew that the case was going to get picked apart , ” she says . “ And we know there ’ s not a person on the FBI team or the DOJ team who thinks this is not the right result . There is no case to be brought here . But it ’ s very busy . It ’ s very intense . Director [ James ] Comey was very clear he wanted this completed as soon as humanly possible and outside of the political environment . So there was a real focus to get it done before the conventions that were happening that summer . And so that ’ s what we did . ”
“ But her emails ” would soon give way to an actual threat to national security , one that existed not in the fever dreams of Fox News and the Breitbart comments section , but in the real , dangerous world the FBI exists to protect us from , where things like foreign meddling in our elections takes place : strong evidence of Russian interference in the election on behalf of Trump .
“ There are two things that happen in the late summer of 2016 , ” Page says . “ The first , of course , is that the FBI gets the predication [ courtesy of loose-lipped George Papadopoulos ] , which starts the Russian investigation . We learn about the possibility that there ’ s someone on the Trump campaign coordinating with the Russian government in the release of emails , which will damage the Clinton campaign . ”
“ Predication ” sounds mild for what it really means ; in the summer of 2016 , the FBI and the intelligence community were seeing increasing signs from a variety of intelligence sources and programs ( that Page can not and will not discuss due to classification reasons ) that members of the Trump campaign were tied to a variety of Russian intelligence services , and that the Russian Federation was in the midst of trying to manipulate the 2016 United States election with a sweeping information-warfare and propaganda effort . As The New York Times reported on Nov. 22 , U.S. intel services concluded , and have told Senate Republicans , that Russia mounted a massive disinformation campaign to implicate Ukraine in 2016 meddling and hide its own role .
At the end of July 2016 , Page finds herself transitioning from one investigation , the Hillary Clinton email inquiry , to another , the Russian government disinformation probe . Trump is not under investigation , but the FBI is trying to determine if someone associated with his campaign is working with Russia .
“ We were very deliberate and conservative about who we first opened on because we recognized how sensitive a situation it was , ” Page says . “ So the prospect that we were spying on the campaign or even investigating candidate Trump himself is just false . That ’ s not what we were doing . ”
From summer 2016 to spring 2017 , Page worked for McCabe , who had become deputy director . They were very busy , but things were largely normal . And then , on May 9 , 2017 , FBI Director Comey was fired . What was that like ?
“ It was horrible , ” Page said . “ It was a devastating moment at the FBI . It was like a funeral , only worse , because at least when someone dies , you get to come together and celebrate and talk about that person . He was still alive . But he was inaccessible to us . It jolted the ranks and the investigation . It was so abrupt . He was there one day and gone the next . ”
“ Well , I mean , all of it was ! ” she replied . “ The FBI director had just been fired . Yes , it was totally within the authority of the president , but it was unprecedented and unimaginable given the circumstances . The president fired him with the knowledge that , of course , we were investigating Russian contacts with his campaign . I mean , it just gave the aura of an obstructive effort . ”
Page would have probably just been another FBI lawyer if it wasn ’ t for the extraordinarily politicized environment and a president who had a habit of attacking career government employees . Page , like many other targets of Trump ’ s wrath , felt the pressure both from the external force of his massive social media presence , but also from within the government .
“ At the end of July in 2017 , I am informed by the DOJ Inspector General 's Office that I ’ m under investigation for political text messages and honestly , I have no idea what they ’ re talking about , ” she told me . “ I have no recollection . And initially they ’ re very coy about it . They don ’ t tell me much about it . I don ’ t have the first clue what they ’ re talking about . What I do know is that my text messages will reveal that I had previously had an affair . I ’ m overwhelmed by dread and embarrassment at the prospect that OIG investigators , Andy , and my colleagues , now know or could learn about this deeply personal secret . ”
She doesn ’ t think for a minute that her texts with Peter Strzok are too political . They are largely devoted to work and to talking about family members and various articles they read . The few texts that so convulsed the Republicans involved Page asking for reassurance that Trump wouldn ’ t become president , and Strzok replying with “ No . No he ’ s not . We ’ ll stop it. ” Glenn Kessler wrote in The Washington Post that “ some of the texts reflect a deep animus toward Trump and the way he conducted himself during the 2016 campaign . ”
“ Having an opinion and sharing that opinion publicly or privately with another person is squarely within the permissible bounds of the Hatch Act . ”
She is convinced that she ’ s followed the rules . She is , after all , a lawyer and knows that she is a restricted employee under the Hatch Act and can ’ t engage in partisan political activity . “ And I know I ’ m nowhere close to that , ” she says . “ I don ’ t engage in any sort of partisan politicking at all . But having an opinion and sharing that opinion publicly or privately with another person is squarely within the permissible bounds of the Hatch Act . It ’ s in the regs . Yeah , it says it plainly . I ’ m thinking , I know I ’ m a federal employee , but I retain my First Amendment rights . So I ’ m really not all that worried about it . ”
So she hires a lawyer and meets with the IG , who interviews her a number of times . A very small number of people at the FBI know about the investigation , and it stays a secret for six months , and it remains a secret for six months , until the day after Michael Flynn pleads guilty . Then in early December 2017 , the day after Flynn ’ s plea , a report comes out about Page being under investigation for political bias—and it includes the affair . The affair was not part of IG ’ s investigation and not part of their review .
The Inspector General ’ s Office had guaranteed Page and Strzok that the affair would not be made public . But then , The Washington Post included the affair in its story . And in a slip of a second , Page goes from being an anonymous government lawyer to playing an unwilling and recurring role in Trump ’ s twisted tweetstorms .
“ So now I have to deal with the aftermath of having the most wrong thing I ’ ve ever done in my life become public , ” she says . “ And that ’ s when I become the source of the president ’ s personal mockery and insults . Because before this moment in time , there ’ s not a person outside of my small legal community who knows who I am or what I do . I ’ m a normal public servant , just a G-15 , standard-level lawyer , like every other lawyer at the Justice Department . ”
And despite how awful that felt , Page had no idea it was going to get much , much worse .
“ After this comes out , there ’ s a firestorm , of course , and now the president and the Republicans on the Hill latch on to this , and it becomes about political bias , ” she explains . “ A week or two later , Rod Rosenstein [ then the deputy attorney general ] was scheduled to testify on the Hill . And the night before his testimony , the Justice Department spokesperson , Sarah Flores , calls the beat reporters into the Justice Department . This is late at night on a weekday . Calls them in to provide a cherry-picked selection of my text messages to review and report on in advance of Rod Rosenstein going to the Hill the next morning . ”
Why does she think the administration released her text messages ?
“ You ’ d have to ask Sarah Flores , ” she says . “ I can tell you that the reporters there that night were told that they weren ’ t allowed to source them to the Justice Department , and that they weren ’ t allowed to copy or remove them , just take notes . That ’ s what I know . ”
“ Those texts were selected for their political impact . They lack a lot of context . Many of them are n't even about him or me . ”
Sarah Isgur Flores has left the administration and referred questions to the Justice Department . In 2017 , Flores said that the Justice Department inspector general approved the release of the texts to congressional committees , and that DOJ then provided those texts to reporters who cover the agency after they started to leak out . “ As we understand now , some members of the media had already received copies of the texts before that—but those disclosures were not authorized by the department , ” Flores said then .
DOJ declined to comment . As Politico noted at the time , “ The DOJ decision to release the text messages to the media and lawmakers before the IG report has drawn criticism from outside the department. ” Ben Wittes wrote on the Lawfare blog , “ Rosenstein here has , at a minimum , contributed to that circus—at the expense of his own employees . In throwing a career FBI agent and career FBI lawyer to the wolves by authorizing the release to the public of their private text messages—without any finding that they had done anything wrong—he once again sent a message to his workforce that he is not the sort of man with whom you want to share your foxhole . ”
Justice Department officials have said the texts , sent on FBI-issued devices , were subject to public disclosure . In a statement , Rosenstein noted that career Justice Department employees , not political appointees , made the decision to release them . “ They were official government records related to FBI business and there was no legal basis to withhold them , so they should be released as requested by Congress , ” he said .
Regardless , Page felt abandoned by the FBI and Justice because of the release of the messages and because the bureau issued no statement defending her and Strzok . “ So things get worse , ” she continues . “ And of course , you know , those texts were selected for their political impact . They lack a lot of context . Many of them aren ’ t even about him or me . We ’ re not given an opportunity to provide any context . In a lot of those texts we were talking about other people like our family members or articles we had sent each other . ”
“ There ’ s not really anything to do , ” she tells me . “ I go back to work . I try to keep my life together. ” But she didn ’ t stay . She left the FBI in May 2018 ( which is why she says she is now free to talk to the press—she hasn ’ t worked for the government for 18 months ) .
Could she have stayed if she had wanted to ? “ No , not for much longer . It was very inhospitable . ”
Does it feel like a trauma ? “ It is . I wouldn ’ t even call it PTSD because it ’ s not over . It ’ s ongoing . It ’ s not a historical event that is being relived . It just keeps happening . ”
And it ’ s still going on ? “ I mean , he tweeted about me four days ago , ” she told me on Nov. 18 . “ When Roger Stone got convicted , he asked , why isn ’ t Page in jail too ? Not to mention , you know , his truly reprehensible , degrading stunt at his rally , in which he used my name to simulate an orgasm . And I don ’ t ever know when the president ’ s going to attack next . And when it happens , it can still sort of upend my day . You don ’ t really get used to it . ”
She doesn ’ t use Facebook or Instagram ( and was not on Twitter until this story published ) , so she relies on a group of her close friends—the support system , along with her husband , that has helped her get through the last two years—to be her alert system .
“ I ’ ll get a text from a friend alerting me to an outrageous tweet by the president and my first question is always—is it about me ? Often the answer is yes , ” she says .
I ask her about how for about a month back when all this started , Trump called her the “ lovely ” Lisa Page . She postulates that it ’ s possible after her congressional testimony that he saw a picture of her . Which makes as much sense as anything in Trumpworld . One thing becomes quickly apparent talking to Page : What really upset her , what still devastates her , was not the end of her extremely promising career at the FBI , but instead what Trump has done to the FBI itself .
“ It ’ s crushing to see the noble Justice Department , my Justice Department , the place I grew up in , feel like it ’ s abandoned its principles of truth and independence . ”
“ It ’ s very painful to see to places like the FBI and the Department of Justice that represent so much of what is excellent about this country , not fulfilling the critical obligation that they have to speak truth to power , ” she tells me . “ The thing about the FBI that is so extraordinary is that it is made up of a group of men and women whose every instinct is to run toward the fight . It ’ s in the fiber of everybody there . It ’ s the lifeblood . So it ’ s particularly devastating to be betrayed by an organization I still care about so deeply . And it ’ s crushing to see the noble Justice Department , my Justice Department , the place I grew up in , feel like it ’ s abandoned its principles of truth and independence . ”
Page accepts that her life will never be the same , that there ’ s no “ normal life ” to return to . She ’ s still married to her husband and they have two small children . Ultimately , she was just another public servant like Fiona Hill or Marie Yovanovitch . She was dragged into the spotlight , her text messages weaponized , and her life destroyed so that the Trump administration could have a brief distraction .
The era of Trump populism always had an ugly edge , particularly toward women . Trump revels in bringing misery to his opponents and will always seek out and exploit any weakness . Page “ wasn ’ t nice to him , ” and so in his eyes she can be endlessly targeted and assaulted .
It ’ s tempting to describe this as just part of Trump ’ s deep , baked-in misogyny and sociopathy , but in Page ’ s case it ’ s worse ; it ’ s a sign of how deeply he ’ s corrupted the government to serve his will and his whims . His apologists have become part of Trump ’ s own squad of witch-hunters , hunting fantasies like “ Ukrainian interference ” while attacking the people who tried to protect us from Russian attacks .
It ’ s not just that Lisa Page may never be safe as long as Trump is president .
CORRECTION : In the original version of this article , the sentence describing the Nov. 22 report in The New York Times about intel services briefing Senate Republicans on Russia trying to implicate Ukraine in 2016 election meddling was in quotation marks . That sentence is in fact a paraphrase .","It’s not often that you interview a subject who has no interest in being famous. But recently, I did just that when I sat down with Lisa Page the week before Thanksgiving in my hotel room in Washington, D.C. Page, of course, is the former FBI lawyer whose text-message exchanges with agent Peter Strzok that belittled Donald Trump and expressed fear at his possible victory became international news.

Leaked press accounts indicate the report will exonerate Page of the allegation that she acted unprofessionally or showed bias against Trump.

How does it feel after all this time to finally have the IG apparently affirm what she’s been saying all along? She said she wouldn’t discuss the findings until they were officially public, but she did note: “While it would be nice to have the IG confirm publicly that my personal opinions had absolutely no bearing on the course of the Russia investigations, I don’t kid myself that the fact will matter very much for a lot of people. The president has a very loud megaphone.”

Page, 40, is thin and athletic. She speaks in an exceedingly confident, clear, and lawyerly way. But having been through the MAGA meat grinder has clearly worn her down, not unlike the other women I’ve met who’ve been subjected to the president’s abuse.

Does it affect you in your normal day-to-day life?

“I wish it didn’t,” she said. “I’m someone who’s always in my head anyway—so now otherwise normal interactions take on a different meaning. Like, when somebody makes eye contact with me on the Metro, I kind of wince, wondering if it’s because they recognize me, or are they just scanning the train like people do?

Rising Through the Ranks

Lisa Page did not aspire to fame or fortune. She was, she says, “one of those nerdy kids who from very early on knew I wanted work for the government and make the world a better place.” Born in the San Fernando Valley, she and her family moved to Ohio in her teens. She went to American University in Washington, D.C., and then moved back home to central Ohio to attend law school, living with her parents so she could save money.

After graduating from law school, she was one of an elite group selected for admission in the Department of Justice Honors Program in 2006—and the only woman in her class of five entering the Criminal Division. She worked as a federal prosecutor for six years before moving across the street to the FBI’s office of general counsel. Soon after her arrival, the deputy general counsel over national-security law hired her for a new special-counsel-type position in 2013.

Once there, her path begins to be set.

“I start [in the role] in early 2013, and there are two big events that kind of set the trajectory for the rest of my career at the FBI: the Boston bombing in April 2013, and Edward Snowden’s leaks in June of the same year,” she told me. “And those are both significant in their own ways, because the Boston bombing introduces me to Andy McCabe, who at the time was the head of the counterterrorism division at the FBI. Two months later, the Snowden leaks hit, which became a transformative moment for the intelligence community, setting off a series of reforms by the Obama administration with respect to the legal authorities that we rely on to collect intelligence.”

Eventually, she was asked to lead that effort, “which gives me a lot of exposure to senior FBI executives, as well as leaders through the IC, DOJ, and White House.”

Page continued to rise through the ranks of the FBI and was assigned to more significant and substantive work. She became close with McCabe. Eventually she became McCabe’s special counsel.

Hillary’s Emails and Russia—All At once

By February 2016, she was working on one of the most important investigations at the FBI—the Hillary Clinton email case. “We knew that the case was going to get picked apart,” she says. “And we know there’s not a person on the FBI team or the DOJ team who thinks this is not the right result. There is no case to be brought here. But it’s very busy. It’s very intense. Director [James] Comey was very clear he wanted this completed as soon as humanly possible and outside of the political environment. So there was a real focus to get it done before the conventions that were happening that summer. And so that’s what we did.”

“But her emails” would soon give way to an actual threat to national security, one that existed not in the fever dreams of Fox News and the Breitbart comments section, but in the real, dangerous world the FBI exists to protect us from, where things like foreign meddling in our elections takes place: strong evidence of Russian interference in the election on behalf of Trump.

“There are two things that happen in the late summer of 2016,” Page says. “The first, of course, is that the FBI gets the predication [courtesy of loose-lipped George Papadopoulos], which starts the Russian investigation. We learn about the possibility that there’s someone on the Trump campaign coordinating with the Russian government in the release of emails, which will damage the Clinton campaign.”

“Predication” sounds mild for what it really means; in the summer of 2016, the FBI and the intelligence community were seeing increasing signs from a variety of intelligence sources and programs (that Page cannot and will not discuss due to classification reasons) that members of the Trump campaign were tied to a variety of Russian intelligence services, and that the Russian Federation was in the midst of trying to manipulate the 2016 United States election with a sweeping information-warfare and propaganda effort. As The New York Times reported on Nov. 22, U.S. intel services concluded, and have told Senate Republicans, that Russia mounted a massive disinformation campaign to implicate Ukraine in 2016 meddling and hide its own role.

At the end of July 2016, Page finds herself transitioning from one investigation, the Hillary Clinton email inquiry, to another, the Russian government disinformation probe. Trump is not under investigation, but the FBI is trying to determine if someone associated with his campaign is working with Russia.

“We were very deliberate and conservative about who we first opened on because we recognized how sensitive a situation it was,” Page says. “So the prospect that we were spying on the campaign or even investigating candidate Trump himself is just false. That’s not what we were doing.”

From Anonymity to Infamy

From summer 2016 to spring 2017, Page worked for McCabe, who had become deputy director. They were very busy, but things were largely normal. And then, on May 9, 2017, FBI Director Comey was fired. What was that like?

“ It was horrible,” Page said. “It was a devastating moment at the FBI. It was like a funeral, only worse, because at least when someone dies, you get to come together and celebrate and talk about that person. He was still alive. But he was inaccessible to us. It jolted the ranks and the investigation. It was so abrupt. He was there one day and gone the next.”

Was that very unusual?

“Well, I mean, all of it was!” she replied. “The FBI director had just been fired. Yes, it was totally within the authority of the president, but it was unprecedented and unimaginable given the circumstances. The president fired him with the knowledge that, of course, we were investigating Russian contacts with his campaign. I mean, it just gave the aura of an obstructive effort.”

Page would have probably just been another FBI lawyer if it wasn’t for the extraordinarily politicized environment and a president who had a habit of attacking career government employees. Page, like many other targets of Trump’s wrath, felt the pressure both from the external force of his massive social media presence, but also from within the government.

“At the end of July in 2017, I am informed by the DOJ Inspector General's Office that I’m under investigation for political text messages and honestly, I have no idea what they’re talking about,” she told me. “I have no recollection. And initially they’re very coy about it. They don’t tell me much about it. I don’t have the first clue what they’re talking about. What I do know is that my text messages will reveal that I had previously had an affair. I’m overwhelmed by dread and embarrassment at the prospect that OIG investigators, Andy, and my colleagues, now know or could learn about this deeply personal secret.”

She doesn’t think for a minute that her texts with Peter Strzok are too political. They are largely devoted to work and to talking about family members and various articles they read. The few texts that so convulsed the Republicans involved Page asking for reassurance that Trump wouldn’t become president, and Strzok replying with “No. No he’s not. We’ll stop it.” Glenn Kessler wrote in The Washington Post that “some of the texts reflect a deep animus toward Trump and the way he conducted himself during the 2016 campaign.”

“ Having an opinion and sharing that opinion publicly or privately with another person is squarely within the permissible bounds of the Hatch Act. ”

She is convinced that she’s followed the rules. She is, after all, a lawyer and knows that she is a restricted employee under the Hatch Act and can’t engage in partisan political activity. “And I know I’m nowhere close to that,” she says. “I don’t engage in any sort of partisan politicking at all. But having an opinion and sharing that opinion publicly or privately with another person is squarely within the permissible bounds of the Hatch Act. It’s in the regs. Yeah, it says it plainly. I’m thinking, I know I’m a federal employee, but I retain my First Amendment rights. So I’m really not all that worried about it.”

So she hires a lawyer and meets with the IG, who interviews her a number of times. A very small number of people at the FBI know about the investigation, and it stays a secret for six months, and it remains a secret for six months, until the day after Michael Flynn pleads guilty. Then in early December 2017, the day after Flynn’s plea, a report comes out about Page being under investigation for political bias—and it includes the affair. The affair was not part of IG’s investigation and not part of their review.

The Inspector General’s Office had guaranteed Page and Strzok that the affair would not be made public. But then, The Washington Post included the affair in its story. And in a slip of a second, Page goes from being an anonymous government lawyer to playing an unwilling and recurring role in Trump’s twisted tweetstorms.

“So now I have to deal with the aftermath of having the most wrong thing I’ve ever done in my life become public,” she says. “And that’s when I become the source of the president’s personal mockery and insults. Because before this moment in time, there’s not a person outside of my small legal community who knows who I am or what I do. I’m a normal public servant, just a G-15, standard-level lawyer, like every other lawyer at the Justice Department.”

And despite how awful that felt, Page had no idea it was going to get much, much worse.

Trump’s ‘Truly Reprehensible... Stunt’

“After this comes out, there’s a firestorm, of course, and now the president and the Republicans on the Hill latch on to this, and it becomes about political bias,” she explains. “A week or two later, Rod Rosenstein [then the deputy attorney general] was scheduled to testify on the Hill. And the night before his testimony, the Justice Department spokesperson, Sarah Flores, calls the beat reporters into the Justice Department. This is late at night on a weekday. Calls them in to provide a cherry-picked selection of my text messages to review and report on in advance of Rod Rosenstein going to the Hill the next morning.”

Why does she think the administration released her text messages?

“You’d have to ask Sarah Flores,” she says. “I can tell you that the reporters there that night were told that they weren’t allowed to source them to the Justice Department, and that they weren’t allowed to copy or remove them, just take notes. That’s what I know.”

“ Those texts were selected for their political impact. They lack a lot of context. Many of them aren't even about him or me. ”

Sarah Isgur Flores has left the administration and referred questions to the Justice Department. In 2017, Flores said that the Justice Department inspector general approved the release of the texts to congressional committees, and that DOJ then provided those texts to reporters who cover the agency after they started to leak out. “As we understand now, some members of the media had already received copies of the texts before that—but those disclosures were not authorized by the department,” Flores said then.

DOJ declined to comment. As Politico noted at the time, “The DOJ decision to release the text messages to the media and lawmakers before the IG report has drawn criticism from outside the department.” Ben Wittes wrote on the Lawfare blog, “Rosenstein here has, at a minimum, contributed to that circus—at the expense of his own employees. In throwing a career FBI agent and career FBI lawyer to the wolves by authorizing the release to the public of their private text messages—without any finding that they had done anything wrong—he once again sent a message to his workforce that he is not the sort of man with whom you want to share your foxhole.”

Justice Department officials have said the texts, sent on FBI-issued devices, were subject to public disclosure. In a statement, Rosenstein noted that career Justice Department employees, not political appointees, made the decision to release them. “They were official government records related to FBI business and there was no legal basis to withhold them, so they should be released as requested by Congress,” he said.

Regardless, Page felt abandoned by the FBI and Justice because of the release of the messages and because the bureau issued no statement defending her and Strzok. “So things get worse,” she continues. “And of course, you know, those texts were selected for their political impact. They lack a lot of context. Many of them aren’t even about him or me. We’re not given an opportunity to provide any context. In a lot of those texts we were talking about other people like our family members or articles we had sent each other.”

I ask her what she did next.

“There’s not really anything to do,” she tells me. “I go back to work. I try to keep my life together.” But she didn’t stay. She left the FBI in May 2018 (which is why she says she is now free to talk to the press—she hasn’t worked for the government for 18 months).

Could she have stayed if she had wanted to? “No, not for much longer. It was very inhospitable.”

Does it feel like a trauma? “It is. I wouldn’t even call it PTSD because it’s not over. It’s ongoing. It’s not a historical event that is being relived. It just keeps happening.”

And it’s still going on? “I mean, he tweeted about me four days ago,” she told me on Nov. 18. “When Roger Stone got convicted, he asked, why isn’t Page in jail too? Not to mention, you know, his truly reprehensible, degrading stunt at his rally, in which he used my name to simulate an orgasm. And I don’t ever know when the president’s going to attack next. And when it happens, it can still sort of upend my day. You don’t really get used to it.”

Watching the Justice Dept. Collapse

She doesn’t use Facebook or Instagram (and was not on Twitter until this story published), so she relies on a group of her close friends—the support system, along with her husband, that has helped her get through the last two years—to be her alert system.

“I’ll get a text from a friend alerting me to an outrageous tweet by the president and my first question is always—is it about me? Often the answer is yes,” she says.

I ask her about how for about a month back when all this started, Trump called her the “lovely” Lisa Page. She postulates that it’s possible after her congressional testimony that he saw a picture of her. Which makes as much sense as anything in Trumpworld. One thing becomes quickly apparent talking to Page: What really upset her, what still devastates her, was not the end of her extremely promising career at the FBI, but instead what Trump has done to the FBI itself.

“ It’s crushing to see the noble Justice Department, my Justice Department, the place I grew up in, feel like it’s abandoned its principles of truth and independence. ”

“It’s very painful to see to places like the FBI and the Department of Justice that represent so much of what is excellent about this country, not fulfilling the critical obligation that they have to speak truth to power,” she tells me. “The thing about the FBI that is so extraordinary is that it is made up of a group of men and women whose every instinct is to run toward the fight. It’s in the fiber of everybody there. It’s the lifeblood. So it’s particularly devastating to be betrayed by an organization I still care about so deeply. And it’s crushing to see the noble Justice Department, my Justice Department, the place I grew up in, feel like it’s abandoned its principles of truth and independence.”

Page accepts that her life will never be the same, that there’s no “normal life” to return to. She’s still married to her husband and they have two small children. Ultimately, she was just another public servant like Fiona Hill or Marie Yovanovitch. She was dragged into the spotlight, her text messages weaponized, and her life destroyed so that the Trump administration could have a brief distraction.

The era of Trump populism always had an ugly edge, particularly toward women. Trump revels in bringing misery to his opponents and will always seek out and exploit any weakness. Page “wasn’t nice to him,” and so in his eyes she can be endlessly targeted and assaulted.

It’s tempting to describe this as just part of Trump’s deep, baked-in misogyny and sociopathy, but in Page’s case it’s worse; it’s a sign of how deeply he’s corrupted the government to serve his will and his whims. His apologists have become part of Trump’s own squad of witch-hunters, hunting fantasies like “Ukrainian interference” while attacking the people who tried to protect us from Russian attacks.

It’s not just that Lisa Page may never be safe as long as Trump is president.

It’s that we won’t be safe, either.

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — The Justice Department ’ s internal watchdog was caught in a political tug of war Wednesday as Republican and Democratic senators used his report on the origins of the Russia investigation involving Donald Trump ’ s 2016 campaign to support their views that it was a legitimate probe or a badly bungled farce .
Inspector General Michael Horowitz testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee about his findings that while the FBI had a legitimate basis to launch the investigation and was not motivated by political bias in doing so , there were major flaws in how that investigation was conducted .
The hearing was the latest reflection of Washington ’ s intense politicization . Senators from both parties praised a detailed , nuanced report by a widely respected , nonpartisan investigator , while pressing him to call attention to findings that back their positions .
He noted , on one hand , his conclusion that there was a proper basis to open the investigation and that that decision did not appear motivated by political bias . And under questioning from Democrats , he acknowledged the absence of evidence for some of the most sensational claims by Trump and his supporters : that the investigation into ties between his presidential campaign and Russia had been opened for political reasons , that agents had infiltrated his election bid or that former President Barack Obama had directed a wiretap of the Republican candidate .
Still , his opening statement was overwhelmingly critical of the investigation , and he returned time and again throughout the hearing to serious problems that he said underscored the need for policy changes . He made clear that the FBI should not be comforted by his findings .
The most serious problems , he said , concerned FBI applications for court approval to eavesdrop on a former Trump campaign aide . He rebuked officials up and down the chain of command for failing to update judges as they learned new information that undercut some of their original assertions .
“ It doesn ’ t vindicate anybody at the FBI who touched this , including the leadership , ” Horowitz said . That was a rejection of the views of former FBI Director James Comey , who earlier this week had claimed vindication for the bureau based on Horowitz ’ s conclusions .
Republicans and Democrats pressed Horowitz on whether he believed the FBI had acted with partisan bias . His response was hedged : He said the multitude of errors during the surveillance warrant process , which included the altering of an email by an FBI lawyer , was so “ inexplicable ” and yielded no obvious explanations that he could not be confident about the intention .
Even so , Horowitz also repeatedly noted under questioning from Democrats that he had not found evidence that the FBI opened its investigation for political reasons .

But Horowitz said they had a relatively technical disagreement — Durham , he said , believed the evidence was sufficient to open a preliminary investigation but not a full one . The latter gives the FBI more intrusive tools for an investigation .
Horowitz ’ s report identified significant problems with applications to receive and renew warrants to monitor the communications of former Trump campaign aide Carter Page in 2016 and 2017 . Investigators were concerned about Page ’ s ties to Russia , but never accused him of wrongdoing .

The hearing was the latest reflection of Washington’s intense politicization. Senators from both parties praised a detailed, nuanced report by a widely respected, nonpartisan investigator, while pressing him to call attention to findings that back their positions.

Horowitz himself tried to strike a balance.

He noted, on one hand, his conclusion that there was a proper basis to open the investigation and that that decision did not appear motivated by political bias. And under questioning from Democrats, he acknowledged the absence of evidence for some of the most sensational claims by Trump and his supporters: that the investigation into ties between his presidential campaign and Russia had been opened for political reasons, that agents had infiltrated his election bid or that former President Barack Obama had directed a wiretap of the Republican candidate.

Still, his opening statement was overwhelmingly critical of the investigation, and he returned time and again throughout the hearing to serious problems that he said underscored the need for policy changes. He made clear that the FBI should not be comforted by his findings.

Even so, Horowitz also repeatedly noted under questioning from Democrats that he had not found evidence that the FBI opened its investigation for political reasons. The probe began with proper cause, he said, after the FBI learned that a Trump campaign aide had been told that Russia had information that could hurt the presidential campaign of Trump’s Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.

“It finds that it was a properly predicated investigation based on the rules of the FBI,” Horowitz said of his report.

Trump and his supporters are counting on different conclusions from a separate investigation led by John Durham, a prosecutor selected by Attorney General William Barr to investigate the early days of the Russia investigation. Durham issued a statement disputing some of Horowitz’s conclusions.

But Horowitz said they had a relatively technical disagreement — Durham, he said, believed the evidence was sufficient to open a preliminary investigation but not a full one. The latter gives the FBI more intrusive tools for an investigation.

The agent’s presence was a “pretext,” Horowitz said, to collect information that might be relevant for the investigation.

The FBI debated but ultimately opted against giving a standard and more extensive defensive briefing that Russia might be trying to influence their campaign, fearful it could impede the ongoing counterintelligence investigation.

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., suggested the FBI’s decision was reasonable, particularly because Flynn was himself under suspicion. He later pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his interactions with Russia’s ambassador to the United States.

Nonetheless, Horowitz said, “it raises significant policy questions.”

FBI Director Christopher Wray, who has said he accepts all the inspector general’s findings, is making changes on the briefing process. The FBI said that, going forward, briefings will be “solely intended to provide candidates” with relevant information and that FBI briefers will not be associated with any ongoing FBI investigation.

In a blistering opening statement, the committee chairman, GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said the code name for the FBI investigation, “Crossfire Hurricane,” was an apt title “because that’s what we ended up with — a ‘Crossfire Hurricane.’”

“What happened here is the system failed. People at the highest levels of government took the law into their own hands,” said Graham, a Trump ally.

Other email traffic sheds light on a controversy involving State Department under secretary for management Patrick Kennedy and a request he made in 2015 that the FBI reduce its classification of a Clinton email related to the Sept. 11, 2012 attacks in Benghazi.

Clinton investigation notes released by the FBI in October showed that an FBI official said during an interview as part of the email probe that Kennedy asked him and others at the FBI to relax classifications on some emails. (RELATED: State Dept. Official Wanted Clinton Email Reclassified Because It ‘Caused Problems’)

The new FBI release contains a May 21, 2015 email in which Michael Steinbach, the FBI’s assistant director of the counterterrorism division, detailed a conversation he had with Kennedy about the classification issue.

Steinbach said that the FBI had determined that one of Clinton’s emails should be classified using b(1) and b(7) redactions, used to protect information in the interest of national defense and to prevent the disclosure of a confidential source, respectively. Kennedy asked Steinbach to classify the email using only the b(1) category.

An email sent two days earlier from a separate FBI official provided more information about the dispute.

The official, whose name is redacted, wrote that the Clinton email was redacted and classified on the rationale that it contained information that would cause “interference with foreign relations.”

The FBI official wrote that the email could disclose sources and investigative methods used by the bureau.

“While the email does not name the particular official, this might be deduced and, given the threat of violence in the region, any surmise could be fatal for whoever cooperated with us,” the official wrote.

“State will say no one will know if it is redacted, but that is not how classification works,” they added.

The official wrote that he informed Kennedy of that rationale and that Kennedy said he would be in contact with Steinbach.

The FBI release also includes an email from the attorney of Bryan Pagliano, the Hillary Clinton State Department aide who set up and managed her secret email server. In the email, Mark MacDougall, Pagliano’s lawyer, informed the FBI that Pagliano would decline the bureau’s request for an investigation. Pagliano would eventually meet with the FBI in December, but only after receiving limited immunity from the Department of Justice.

The Justice Department announced Friday that former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe will not be charged following an allegation by the department's inspector general that he lied to investigators about a leak to the media.

In a letter to McCabe's attorneys, the department said that ""based on the totality of the circumstances and all of the information known to the government at this time, we consider the matter closed.""

The decision is not likely to sit well with President Trump.

Trump has repeatedly criticized McCabe online and in public remarks. McCabe has long been the target of Republican leaders who allege political bias within the FBI.

McCabe's wife ran for the state legislature in Virginia as a Democrat, prompting early attacks that he might be going easy on Hillary Clinton. Later, McCabe was fired after investigators concluded he lacked candor about an episode involving the release of information to a reporter.

He was relieved of duty in March, hours before he was set to retire.

McCabe always has maintained he has done nothing wrong and called himself the victim of political vengeance.

""At long last, justice has been done in this matter,"" McCabe's lawyers said on Friday.

""We said at the outset of the criminal investigation, almost two years ago, that if the facts and the law determined the result, no charges would be brought,"" they said in a statement. ""We are pleased that Andrew McCabe and his family can go on with their lives without this cloud hanging over them.""

The allegations against McCabe stemmed from a Justice Department Office of Inspector General's report, which found that McCabe ""lacked candor"" when he told investigators that he did not know who authorized an aide to talk to the Wall Street Journal about the FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation.

The Justice Department's decision not to pursue charges against McCabe comes a day after Attorney General William Barr publicly lashed out at Trump, saying his tweets ""make it impossible for me to do my job.""

McCabe has sued the Justice Department, alleging that his March 2018 firing by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions was a politically motivated act of retribution by Trump and ""unlawful.""",www.npr.org,center,daP6ntVOjIcXTiZ0

George Papadopoulos , the former Trump campaign aide , said on Sunday that he felt “ pinned ” during his fateful interview with FBI officers in January 2017 , and that he lied to investigators in an attempt to protect President Donald Trump .
On Friday , Papadopoulos was sentenced to 14 days in federal prison for making false statements to the FBI during the early days of the Justice Department ’ s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election . On Sunday , he was interviewed on ABC ’ s “ This Week . ”
“ At the time of my interview with the FBI , I think around three or four days before that , I was at the inauguration attending parties with senior-level transition officials , ” Papadopoulos told George Stephanopoulos . “ I understood that there was an incipient investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election . ”
“ And I found myself as somebody who worked incredibly hard over the past year with the campaign to actually have the candidate Trump be elected , ” he said . “ And then I found myself pinned between the Department of Justice and the sitting president and having probing questions that I thought might incriminate the sitting president . ”

Papadopoulos said on Sunday that he believed he did not incriminate Trump in his 2017 talks with law enforcement .
“ I didn ’ t understand really the nature of what was going on , ” he said . “ Of course I ’ m remorseful , I ’ m contrite , and I did lie , but , you know , you ’ re just taken off guard , I guess , in a such a momentous situation where you ’ re potentially sitting there , incriminating the president , even though of course I don ’ t think I did . ”
He added : “ You know , that was probably in the back of my mind , of what exactly am I doing here talking about Russian hacking or election interference with the candidate that I just worked for . ”
The former foreign policy adviser pleaded guilty in October to lying to the FBI about his meetings in London with a Maltese professor , Joseph Mifsud — making Papadopoulos the first person to admit guilt to Robert Mueller in the special counsel ’ s sprawling Russia inquiry .
“ He basically presented himself as this well-connected , well-traveled former diplomat who could essentially connect me and the campaign to Russian officials and to other leaders around the world , ” Papadopoulos said of Mifsud .
Mifsud told Papadopoulos in the spring of 2016 that he had obtained “ dirt ” on Hillary Clinton , and would claim to have amassed troves of emails connected to Clinton ’ s campaign , according to Mueller ’ s prosecutors .
“ He sat me down and he was quite giddy , ” Papadopoulos said . “ And he told me , ‘ I have information that the Russians have thousands of Hillary Clinton ’ s emails . ’ ”
A month before that meeting , the emails of Clinton ’ s campaign chairman , John Podesta , were stolen in a data breach . Mueller indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers in relation to the crime in July , as well as on charges of cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and other liberal targets .
Papadopoulos maintained that he was not made aware of the hacks on Podesta or the DNC , and has testified that he did not tell any Trump campaign officials about his conversation with Mifsud regarding Clinton ’ s emails .
Papadopoulos said he chose to keep the professor ’ s claim under wraps because Paul Manafort — shortly after becoming the Trump campaign chairman in May 2016 — quashed the idea of a potential summit between then-candidate Donald Trump and President Vladimir Putin of Russia , which Papadopoulos had been trying to broker .
“ As far as I remember , it didn ’ t seem that Paul Manafort wanted to pursue this meeting , ” Papadopoulos said on Sunday . “ So as far as I remember , why on Earth would I then , after I was shut down in a , I guess in a formal way , after a lot of vacillating between the campaign , would I then tell the campaign something like that ? ”
Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia , the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee , said on Sunday it was unlikely that Papadopoulos did not tell other members of the Trump campaign about his talks with Mifsud .
“ One thing is fairly clear : This is an ambitious guy who wants to be a player in the Trump campaign , ” Warner said of Papadopoulos on CNN ’ s “ State of the Union . ”

Papadopoulos also said he had “ no opinion on ” and “ no knowledge of ” Trump ’ s alleged attempts to obstruct Mueller ’ s investigation , and could not answer whether the special counsel would be able to demonstrate coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin .

Obama officials and FBI collaborated to invent the ‘ Russian collusion ’ narrative
The FBI coordinated very closely with the Obama White House on the investigation of Michael Flynn , while the Obama Justice Department was asleep at the switch . That is among the most revealing takeaways from Thursday ’ s decision by Attorney General Bill Barr to pull the plug on the prosecution of Flynn , who fleetingly served as President Trump ’ s first National Security Advisor . Flynn had been seeking to withdraw his guilty plea to a false-statements charge brought in late 2017 by Special Counsel Robert Mueller .
While working on the Trump transition team in December 2016 , Flynn spoke with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak , in conversations that were intercepted by our government ( because Russian-government operatives , such as Kislyak , are routinely monitored by the FBI and other U.S. intelligence agencies ) . Among the topics Flynn and Kislyak discussed was the imposition of sanctions against Russia , which President Obama had just announced .
That these conversations took place has been known for over three years — ever since a still-unidentified government official leaked that classified information to the Washington Post . For almost as long , it has been known that the FBI became aware of the Flynn–Kislyak discussions very shortly after they happened . What was not known until this week was that then–acting attorney general Yates was out of the loop . She found out about the discussions nearly a week afterwards — from President Obama , of all people .
This was at a White House pow-wow on January 5 , 2017 . That was the day when the chiefs of key intelligence agencies briefed top Obama White House officials on their assessment of Russia ’ s meddling in the campaign . After the main briefing , the president asked Yates and FBI director James Comey to stick around to meet with him , along with Vice President Biden and National Security Adviser Susan Rice . Yates was taken aback when Obama explained that he had “ learned of the information about Flynn ” and his conversation with Kislyak . She was startled because , she later told investigators , she “ had no idea what the president was talking about . ”
Yates had to figure things out by listening to the exchanges between President Obama and FBI director Comey . The latter was not only fully up to speed , he was even prepared to suggest a potential crime — a violation of the moribund Logan Act — that might fit the facts .
According to an FBI report , which was appended ( as Exhibit 4 ) to the Justice Department ’ s motion to dismiss the Flynn case , Yates later said she was “ so surprised by the information she was hearing that she was having a hard time processing it and listening to the conversation at the same time . ”

I’ll bet.

That Yates was in the dark was not the FBI’s fault.

Senators treated Comey like a sexual harassment victim.,2017-06-09,"Corrine Mcconnaughy, Hannah Brown, Lauren Katz, Theodore Schleifer, Li Zhou, Sean Collins, Umair Irfan","Watching former FBI Director James Comey testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee struck a nerve many of us did not quite expect : This thing was going down like a sexual harassment case .
The parallels between Mr. Comey ’ s experiences with President Trump and the facts of a sexual harassment case — I am not the only one to notice them — should perhaps not be that surprising . Sexual harassment is a workplace issue , one in which a supervisor abuses structural power over a subordinate . Americans tuned in , at least in part , to see if Comey would level allegations of improper use of power by his boss , so there was a sense in which the hearings were already set to cover ground familiar to many of us .
But what was more striking was that the hearing itself hit squarely almost all the familiar tropes of how those who allege sexual harassment are treated . Some women watching it unfold on live TV had an unpleasant sense of déjà vu . And if you were a man watching , and thought Comey was treated with undue skepticism , remember that feeling the next time you hear a woman explain how she reacted to a power-abusing superior .
Comey ’ s opening statement did what any claimant of abuse would do . He attempted to make the power issue central to his testimony : He argued that his superior , the president , had abused the authority of his office , taking advantage of his role atop the bureaucracy . Comey said that while he knew he could be fired by any president , the 10-year term of his appointment implied it shouldn ’ t happen for political reasons . And yet , his dismissal seemed to have happened for the worst sort of political reason : for failing to do his boss an unsavory favor .
This workplace claim of abuse of power lies at the heart of the issue , and it is central to many sexual harassment cases . But once the questioning got underway , the parallels became even more inescapable .
Trump cleared the room of everyone except him and Comey , then expressed his “ hope ” the investigation would end
The first two rounds of questioning were actually quite encouraging for Comey — if you view him as a “ claimant. ” Sen. Richard Burr ( R-NC ) moved quickly through many facts surrounding all the issues that might be relevant — the Russian interference claims , the investigation of Michael Flynn ’ s ties to Russia , the Clinton email investigation . Sen. Mark Warner ( D-VA ) kept the focus on President Trump ’ s behavior : What did the president say , and what was it about the circumstances of the conversations that made Comey uncomfortable ? Comey had the opportunity to explain that the situation was sufficiently unsettling that he made sure to document his conversations with Trump , though he never felt the need to do so with Presidents Bush or Obama .
Once Sen. Jim Risch ’ s ( R-ID ) time began , however , the hearing took a fateful turn toward victim-blaming .

Twitter : @ cmMcConnaughy","Watching former FBI Director James Comey testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee struck a nerve many of us did not quite expect: This thing was going down like a sexual harassment case.

The parallels between Mr. Comey’s experiences with President Trump and the facts of a sexual harassment case — I am not the only one to notice them — should perhaps not be that surprising. Sexual harassment is a workplace issue, one in which a supervisor abuses structural power over a subordinate. Americans tuned in, at least in part, to see if Comey would level allegations of improper use of power by his boss, so there was a sense in which the hearings were already set to cover ground familiar to many of us.

But what was more striking was that the hearing itself hit squarely almost all the familiar tropes of how those who allege sexual harassment are treated. Some women watching it unfold on live TV had an unpleasant sense of déjà vu. And if you were a man watching, and thought Comey was treated with undue skepticism, remember that feeling the next time you hear a woman explain how she reacted to a power-abusing superior.

Comey’s opening statement did what any claimant of abuse would do. He attempted to make the power issue central to his testimony: He argued that his superior, the president, had abused the authority of his office, taking advantage of his role atop the bureaucracy. Comey said that while he knew he could be fired by any president, the 10-year term of his appointment implied it shouldn’t happen for political reasons. And yet, his dismissal seemed to have happened for the worst sort of political reason: for failing to do his boss an unsavory favor.

This workplace claim of abuse of power lies at the heart of the issue, and it is central to many sexual harassment cases. But once the questioning got underway, the parallels became even more inescapable.

Trump cleared the room of everyone except him and Comey, then expressed his “hope” the investigation would end

The first two rounds of questioning were actually quite encouraging for Comey — if you view him as a “claimant.” Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) moved quickly through many facts surrounding all the issues that might be relevant — the Russian interference claims, the investigation of Michael Flynn’s ties to Russia, the Clinton email investigation. Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) kept the focus on President Trump’s behavior: What did the president say, and what was it about the circumstances of the conversations that made Comey uncomfortable? Comey had the opportunity to explain that the situation was sufficiently unsettling that he made sure to document his conversations with Trump, though he never felt the need to do so with Presidents Bush or Obama.

Once Sen. Jim Risch’s (R-ID) time began, however, the hearing took a fateful turn toward victim-blaming. First, he asked Comey to reiterate that Trump wasn’t under FBI investigation — which, while true, was irrelevant to the question of whether Trump was interfering with the FBI’s work.

More importantly, Risch focused on the language that Comey said Trump used when allegedly asking him to drop the investigation into Flynn in a way that ignored the context of an extreme imbalance of power. Risch focused on the fact that Trump had expressed the “hope” that Comey would drop the Flynn investigation. “Words matter,” Risch said. He suggested that “I hope” could not possibly imply pressure.

But nobody who has sat in a chair across from a boss, alone in a room, and heard him say he “hopes” you do something — “I hope you don’t report me to the human resources department,” perhaps — would find that argument persuasive.

Why didn’t Comey push back more forcefully against the president?

Rosenstein confirmed that he signed a FISA warrant renewal application for Page , during a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee where he was the first witness as part of the panel ’ s fresh investigation into the origins of the Russia probe .
`` If you knew then what you know now , would you have signed the warrant application ? '' committee Chairman Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , asked Rosenstein .
GRAHAM REQUESTS NAMES OF OFFICIALS WHO SOUGHT TO 'UNMASK ' TRUMP CAMPAIGN , TRANSITION OFFICIALS
Rosenstein , in his opening statement , defended his own actions related to the FISA warrant , saying that “ every application I approved appeared to be justified based on the facts it alleged. ” Rosenstein implicitly pointed the finger at the FBI for since-revealed problems in that process .
“ The FBI was supposed to be following protocols to ensure that every fact was verified , ” Rosenstein said , going on to cite Justice Department inspector general findings last year revealing that the FBI actually “ was not following the written protocols , and that ‘ significant errors ’ appeared in applications filed in connection with the Crossfire Hurricane investigation . ”
Rosenstein repeatedly claimed to be unaware of details that have since been used by critics to raise questions about the probe . Rosenstein said he `` obviously didn ’ t know there was exculpatory evidence '' with regard to the origins of the Russia investigation , including details about Michael Flynn and George Papadopoulos .
Rosenstein also noted that “ one of the most important matters ” during his time at the Justice Department as deputy attorney general was the “ investigation of Russian election influence schemes . ”
He defended his handling of that process , including the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller .
“ Attorney General Sessions had complied with a legal obligation to recuse himself from that investigation , ” Rosenstein said , referring to former Attorney General Jeff Sessions ’ decision to recuse himself from the probe due to his involvement with the Trump campaign in 2016 . “ As a result of events that followed the departure of the FBI Director , I was concerned that the public would not have confidence in the investigation and that the acting FBI Director was not the right person to lead it. ” Rosenstein had recommended Trump remove James Comey as director , effectively making his deputy , Andrew McCabe , the leader of the bureau .
“ I decided that appointing a Special Counsel was the best way to complete the investigation appropriately and promote public confidence in its conclusions , ” Rosenstein said , noting that the appointment of Mueller was “ consistent with Department of Justice precedent . ”
LIST OF OFFICIALS WHO SOUGHT TO UNMASK FLYNN RELEASED : BIDEN , COMEY , OBAMA CHIEF OF STAFF AMONG THEM
“ I asked the Special Counsel to review each criminal allegation the FBI considered relevant to Russian election influence operations and recommended whether to close the matter ; investigate because it might be relevant to Russian election meddling ; or refer the matter to another prosecutor , ” Rosenstein explained , noting that he ensured that Mueller had to go through a “ supervisory chain of command ” with “ highly qualified ” DOJ attorneys and officials .
“ Crossfire Hurricane ” is the FBI ’ s internal code name for the bureau ’ s original investigation into whether members of the Trump campaign were colluding with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election . That investigation was launched by the FBI in July 2016 . Mueller 's team eventually announced that it found no evidence of criminal conspiracy or coordination .
Rosenstein also said that “ whenever agents or prosecutors make serious mistakes or engage in misconduct , ” the DOJ “ must take remedial action . ”
“ Ensuring the integrity of governmental processes is essential to public confidence in the rule of law , ” Rosenstein said .
Rosenstein is the first witness as part of the Senate Judiciary Committee ’ s fresh Russia probe review .
Graham last month outlined the parameters for that investigation , which included , among other things “ whether Robert Mueller should have ever been appointed as special counsel . ”
Graham , R-S.C. , during his opening statement Wednesday , acknowledged the importance of allowing Mueller to run his investigation , recalling legislation that he and GOP senators introduced to protect Mueller from firing .
`` Now it is important to find out what the hell happened , '' Graham said . `` How could it have gotten to be where it wound up being ? ''
Graham also prompted Rosenstein to acknowledge there was scant collusion evidence in August 2017 .
`` The whole concept that the campaign was colluding with the Russians , there was no there there in August 2017 . Do you agree with that statement ? '' he asked .
August 2017 is when Rosenstein penned the “ scope memo ” for Mueller ’ s investigation , which outlined the authority of Mueller . Last month , the memo was released in full , and revealed for the first time that Mueller ’ s authority went significantly beyond what was previously known .

The newly released version of the 2017 scope memo further makes clear that Mueller could look into whether Michael Flynn `` committed a crime or crimes by engaging in conversations with Russian government officials during the period of the Trump transition . ”
Additionally , the scope memo stated that Mueller was charged specifically with investigating whether several former Trump officials -- including Carter Page , Papadopoulos and Paul Manafort -- had `` committed a crime or crimes by colluding with Russian government officials with respect to the Russian government 's efforts to interfere with the 2016 election for President of the United States . ”

DOJ DROPS CASE AGAINST MICHAEL FLYNN , IN WAKE OF INTERNAL MEMO RELEASE
The potential subpoenas would cover documents , communications and witness testimony in a public setting or behind closed doors for any “ current or former executive branch official or employee involved in the 'Crossfire Hurricane ' investigation . ”
Graham is seeking testimony from former FBI Director James Comey , former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe , former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper , former CIA Director John Brennan , former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates and others .
Graham announced earlier that his investigation would specifically focus on unmasking and abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act . It comes amid swirling controversies surrounding the unmasking of Flynn 's name in intelligence reports , as well as the DOJ 's effort to drop the Flynn case citing problems with the FBI 's handling of it .","Former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein testified Wednesday that he would not have signed a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant renewal for former Trump campaign aide Carter Page had he known about the since-revealed misconduct surrounding those warrants -- while faulting the FBI for its handling of the documents.

Rosenstein confirmed that he signed a FISA warrant renewal application for Page, during a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee where he was the first witness as part of the panel’s fresh investigation into the origins of the Russia probe.

""If you knew then what you know now, would you have signed the warrant application?"" committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asked Rosenstein.

""No, I would not,"" Rosenstein said.

GRAHAM REQUESTS NAMES OF OFFICIALS WHO SOUGHT TO 'UNMASK' TRUMP CAMPAIGN, TRANSITION OFFICIALS

Rosenstein, in his opening statement, defended his own actions related to the FISA warrant, saying that “every application I approved appeared to be justified based on the facts it alleged.” Rosenstein implicitly pointed the finger at the FBI for since-revealed problems in that process.

DOJ RELEASES LONG-AWAITED MUELLER SCOPE MEMO

“The FBI was supposed to be following protocols to ensure that every fact was verified,” Rosenstein said, going on to cite Justice Department inspector general findings last year revealing that the FBI actually “was not following the written protocols, and that ‘significant errors’ appeared in applications filed in connection with the Crossfire Hurricane investigation.”

Rosenstein repeatedly claimed to be unaware of details that have since been used by critics to raise questions about the probe. Rosenstein said he ""obviously didn’t know there was exculpatory evidence"" with regard to the origins of the Russia investigation, including details about Michael Flynn and George Papadopoulos.

Rosenstein also noted that “one of the most important matters” during his time at the Justice Department as deputy attorney general was the “investigation of Russian election influence schemes.”

He defended his handling of that process, including the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

“Attorney General Sessions had complied with a legal obligation to recuse himself from that investigation,” Rosenstein said, referring to former Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ decision to recuse himself from the probe due to his involvement with the Trump campaign in 2016. “As a result of events that followed the departure of the FBI Director, I was concerned that the public would not have confidence in the investigation and that the acting FBI Director was not the right person to lead it.” Rosenstein had recommended Trump remove James Comey as director, effectively making his deputy, Andrew McCabe, the leader of the bureau.

“I decided that appointing a Special Counsel was the best way to complete the investigation appropriately and promote public confidence in its conclusions,” Rosenstein said, noting that the appointment of Mueller was “consistent with Department of Justice precedent.”

“I asked the Special Counsel to review each criminal allegation the FBI considered relevant to Russian election influence operations and recommended whether to close the matter; investigate because it might be relevant to Russian election meddling; or refer the matter to another prosecutor,” Rosenstein explained, noting that he ensured that Mueller had to go through a “supervisory chain of command” with “highly qualified” DOJ attorneys and officials.

“Crossfire Hurricane” is the FBI’s internal code name for the bureau’s original investigation into whether members of the Trump campaign were colluding with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election. That investigation was launched by the FBI in July 2016. Mueller's team eventually announced that it found no evidence of criminal conspiracy or coordination.

Rosenstein also said that “whenever agents or prosecutors make serious mistakes or engage in misconduct,” the DOJ “must take remedial action.”

“Ensuring the integrity of governmental processes is essential to public confidence in the rule of law,” Rosenstein said.

Rosenstein is the first witness as part of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s fresh Russia probe review.

Graham last month outlined the parameters for that investigation, which included, among other things “whether Robert Mueller should have ever been appointed as special counsel.”

Rosenstein, in May 2017, appointed Mueller as special counsel.

Graham, R-S.C., during his opening statement Wednesday, acknowledged the importance of allowing Mueller to run his investigation, recalling legislation that he and GOP senators introduced to protect Mueller from firing.

""Now it is important to find out what the hell happened,"" Graham said. ""How could it have gotten to be where it wound up being?""

Graham also prompted Rosenstein to acknowledge there was scant collusion evidence in August 2017.

""The whole concept that the campaign was colluding with the Russians, there was no there there in August 2017. Do you agree with that statement?"" he asked.

Rosenstein replied: ""I agree with that general statement.""

August 2017 is when Rosenstein penned the “scope memo” for Mueller’s investigation, which outlined the authority of Mueller. Last month, the memo was released in full, and revealed for the first time that Mueller’s authority went significantly beyond what was previously known.

FLYNN-KISLYAK TRANSCRIPTS RELEASED

Previously, it had been revealed that in May 2017, Rosenstein authorized Mueller to probe ""i) any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump; ii) any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation; [and] iii) any other matters within the scope of [obstruction of justice laws].”

But, Rosenstein's later August 2017 scope memo had remained largely redacted. The newly released version of the document makes clear that Rosenstein didn't hesitate to authorize a probe into the Trump team that extended beyond general Russian interference efforts.

Meanwhile, Rosenstein’s appearance comes just one day before the committee votes on potential subpoenas for documents and testimony from top Obama officials.

fbi,Newsmax,2,http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/fbi-operating-surveillance-aircraft/2015/06/02/id/648132/,FBI Reveals It's Operating Own Surveillance Air Force Over US Cities ,2015-06-02,,"The FBI is operating a small air force with scores of low-flying planes across the country carrying video and , at times , cellphone surveillance technology - all hidden behind fictitious companies that are fronts for the government , The Associated Press has learned .
The planes ' surveillance equipment is generally used without a judge 's approval , and the FBI said the flights are used for specific , ongoing investigations . In a recent 30-day period , the agency flew above more than 30 cities in 11 states across the country , an AP review found .
Aerial surveillance represents a changing frontier for law enforcement , providing what the government maintains is an important tool in criminal , terrorism or intelligence probes . But the program raises questions about whether there should be updated policies protecting civil liberties as new technologies pose intrusive opportunities for government spying .
U.S. law enforcement officials confirmed for the first time the wide-scale use of the aircraft , which the AP traced to at least 13 fake companies , such as FVX Research , KQM Aviation , NBR Aviation and PXW Services . Even basic aspects of the program are withheld from the public in censored versions of official reports from the Justice Department 's inspector general .
`` The FBI 's aviation program is not secret , '' spokesman Christopher Allen said in a statement . `` Specific aircraft and their capabilities are protected for operational security purposes . '' Allen added that the FBI 's planes `` are not equipped , designed or used for bulk collection activities or mass surveillance . ''
But the planes can capture video of unrelated criminal activity on the ground that could be handed over for prosecutions .
Some of the aircraft can also be equipped with technology that can identify thousands of people below through the cellphones they carry , even if they 're not making a call or in public . Officials said that practice , which mimics cell towers and gets phones to reveal basic subscriber information , is rare .
Details confirmed by the FBI track closely with published reports since at least 2003 that a government surveillance program might be behind suspicious-looking planes slowly circling neighborhoods . The AP traced at least 50 aircraft back to the FBI , and identified more than 100 flights since late April orbiting both major cities and rural areas .
One of the planes , photographed in flight last week by the AP in northern Virginia , bristled with unusual antennas under its fuselage and a camera on its left side . A federal budget document from 2010 mentioned at least 115 planes , including 90 Cessna aircraft , in the FBI 's surveillance fleet .
The FBI also occasionally helps local police with aerial support , such as during the recent disturbance in Baltimore that followed the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray , who sustained grievous injuries while in police custody . Those types of requests are reviewed by senior FBI officials .
The surveillance flights comply with agency rules , an FBI spokesman said . Those rules , which are heavily redacted in publicly available documents , limit the types of equipment the agency can use , as well as the justifications and duration of the surveillance .
Details about the flights come as the Justice Department seeks to navigate privacy concerns arising from aerial surveillance by unmanned aircrafts , or drones . President Barack Obama has said he welcomes a debate on government surveillance , and has called for more transparency about spying in the wake of disclosures about classified programs .
`` These are not your grandparents ' surveillance aircraft , '' said Jay Stanley , a senior policy analyst with the American Civil Liberties Union , calling the flights significant `` if the federal government is maintaining a fleet of aircraft whose purpose is to circle over American cities , especially with the technology we know can be attached to those aircraft . ''
During the past few weeks , the AP tracked planes from the FBI 's fleet on more than 100 flights over at least 11 states plus the District of Columbia , most with Cessna 182T Skylane aircraft . These included parts of Houston , Phoenix , Seattle , Chicago , Boston , Minneapolis and Southern California .
Evolving technology can record higher-quality video from long distances , even at night , and can capture certain identifying information from cellphones using a device known as a `` cell-site simulator '' - or Stingray , to use one of the product 's brand names . These can trick pinpointed cellphones into revealing identification numbers of subscribers , including those not suspected of a crime .
Officials say cellphone surveillance is rare , although the AP found in recent weeks FBI flights orbiting large , enclosed buildings for extended periods where aerial photography would be less effective than electronic signals collection . Those included above Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and the Mall of America in Bloomington , Minnesota .
After The Washington Post revealed flights by two planes circling over Baltimore in early May , the AP began analyzing detailed flight data and aircraft-ownership registrations that shared similar addresses and flight patterns . That review found some FBI missions circled above at least 40,000 residents during a single flight over Anaheim , California , in late May , according to Census data and records provided by the website FlightRadar24.com .
Most flight patterns occurred in counter-clockwise orbits up to several miles wide and roughly one mile above the ground at slow speeds . A 2003 newsletter from the company FLIR Systems Inc. , which makes camera technology such as seen on the planes , described flying slowly in left-handed patterns .
`` Aircraft surveillance has become an indispensable intelligence collection and investigative technique which serves as a force multiplier to the ground teams , '' the FBI said in 2009 when it asked Congress for $ 5.1 million for the program .
Recently , independent journalists and websites have cited companies traced to post office boxes in Virginia , including one shared with the Justice Department . The AP analyzed similar data since early May , while also drawing upon aircraft registration documents , business records and interviews with U.S. officials to understand the scope of the operations .
The FBI asked the AP not to disclose the names of the fake companies it uncovered , saying that would saddle taxpayers with the expense of creating new cover companies to shield the government 's involvement , and could endanger the planes and integrity of the surveillance missions . The AP declined the FBI 's request because the companies ' names - as well as common addresses linked to the Justice Department - are listed on public documents and in government databases .
At least 13 front companies that AP identified being actively used by the FBI are registered to post office boxes in Bristow , Virginia , which is near a regional airport used for private and charter flights . Only one of them appears in state business records .
Included on most aircraft registrations is a mysterious name , Robert Lindley . He is listed as chief executive and has at least three distinct signatures among the companies . Two documents include a signature for Robert Taylor , which is strikingly similar to one of Lindley 's three handwriting patterns .
The FBI would not say whether Lindley is a U.S. government employee . The AP unsuccessfully tried to reach Lindley at phone numbers registered to people of the same name in the Washington area since Monday .
Law enforcement officials said Justice Department lawyers approved the decision to create fictitious companies to protect the flights ' operational security and that the Federal Aviation Administration was aware of the practice . One of the Lindley-headed companies shares a post office box openly used by the Justice Department .
Such elusive practices have endured for decades . A 1990 report by the then-General Accounting Office noted that , in July 1988 , the FBI had moved its `` headquarters-operated '' aircraft into a company that was n't publicly linked to the bureau .
The FBI does not generally obtain warrants to record video from its planes of people moving outside in the open , but it also said that under a new policy it has recently begun obtaining court orders to use cell-site simulators . The Obama administration had until recently been directing local authorities through secret agreements not to reveal their own use of the devices , even encouraging prosecutors to drop cases rather than disclose the technology 's use in open court .
A Justice Department memo last month also expressly barred its component law enforcement agencies from using unmanned drones `` solely for the purpose of monitoring activities protected by the First Amendment '' and said they are to be used only in connection with authorized investigations and activities . A department spokeswoman said the policy applied only to unmanned aircraft systems rather than piloted airplanes .","The FBI is operating a small air force with scores of low-flying planes across the country carrying video and, at times, cellphone surveillance technology - all hidden behind fictitious companies that are fronts for the government, The Associated Press has learned.

Recently, independent journalists and websites have cited companies traced to post office boxes in Virginia, including one shared with the Justice Department. The AP analyzed similar data since early May, while also drawing upon aircraft registration documents, business records and interviews with U.S. officials to understand the scope of the operations.



The FBI asked the AP not to disclose the names of the fake companies it uncovered, saying that would saddle taxpayers with the expense of creating new cover companies to shield the government's involvement, and could endanger the planes and integrity of the surveillance missions. The AP declined the FBI's request because the companies' names - as well as common addresses linked to the Justice Department - are listed on public documents and in government databases.



At least 13 front companies that AP identified being actively used by the FBI are registered to post office boxes in Bristow, Virginia, which is near a regional airport used for private and charter flights. Only one of them appears in state business records.



Included on most aircraft registrations is a mysterious name, Robert Lindley. He is listed as chief executive and has at least three distinct signatures among the companies. Two documents include a signature for Robert Taylor, which is strikingly similar to one of Lindley's three handwriting patterns.



The FBI would not say whether Lindley is a U.S. government employee. The AP unsuccessfully tried to reach Lindley at phone numbers registered to people of the same name in the Washington area since Monday.



Law enforcement officials said Justice Department lawyers approved the decision to create fictitious companies to protect the flights' operational security and that the Federal Aviation Administration was aware of the practice. One of the Lindley-headed companies shares a post office box openly used by the Justice Department.



Such elusive practices have endured for decades. A 1990 report by the then-General Accounting Office noted that, in July 1988, the FBI had moved its ""headquarters-operated"" aircraft into a company that wasn't publicly linked to the bureau.



The FBI does not generally obtain warrants to record video from its planes of people moving outside in the open, but it also said that under a new policy it has recently begun obtaining court orders to use cell-site simulators. The Obama administration had until recently been directing local authorities through secret agreements not to reveal their own use of the devices, even encouraging prosecutors to drop cases rather than disclose the technology's use in open court.



A Justice Department memo last month also expressly barred its component law enforcement agencies from using unmanned drones ""solely for the purpose of monitoring activities protected by the First Amendment"" and said they are to be used only in connection with authorized investigations and activities. A department spokeswoman said the policy applied only to unmanned aircraft systems rather than piloted airplanes.

Napolitano","While the country has been fixated on Donald Trump 's tormenting his Republican primary opponents and deeply concerned about the government ’ s efforts to identify any confederates in the San Bernardino , California , killings , a team of federal prosecutors and FBI agents continues to examine Hillary Clinton ’ s tenure as secretary of state in order to determine whether she committed any crimes and , if so , whether there is sufficient evidence to prove her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt .
What began as an innocent Freedom of Information Act request by Judicial Watch , a D.C.-based public advocacy group promoting transparency in the executive branch , has now become a full criminal investigation , with Clinton as the likely target .
The basic facts are well-known , but the revealed nuances are important , as well . When the State Department responded to the Judicial Watch FOIA request by telling Judicial Watch that it had no emails from Clinton , Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit . When the State Department made the same representation to the court -- as incredible as it seemed at the time -- the judge accepted that representation , and the case was dismissed .
Then The New York Times revealed that Clinton used a private email server instead of the government ’ s server for all of her work-related and personal emails during her four years as secretary of state . After that , the Judicial Watch FOIA case was reinstated , and then the judge in the case demanded of State that it produce Clinton ’ s emails .
When Judicial Watch expressed frustration to the judge about the pace at which it was getting emails , the judge ordered Clinton , “ under penalty of perjury , ” to certify that she had surrendered all her governmental emails to the State Department .
Eventually , Clinton did certify to the court that she did surrender all of her governmental emails to the State Department . She did so by sending paper copies of selected emails , because she had wiped clean her server . She acknowledged that she decided which emails were personal and which were selected as governmental and returned the governmental ones to the State Department . She has denied steadfastly and consistently that she ever sent or received any materials marked `` classified ” while secretary of state using her private server .
All of her behavior has triggered the FBI investigation because she may have committed serious federal crimes . For example , it is a crime to steal federal property . What did she steal ? By diverting to her own venue the digital metadata that accompany all emails -- metadata that , when attached to the work-related emails of a government employee , belong to the government -- she stole that data . The metadata do not appear on her paper copies -- hence the argument that she stole and destroyed the government-owned metadata .
This is particularly troublesome for her present political ambitions because of a federal statute that disqualifies from public office all who have stolen federal property . ( She is probably already barred from public office -- though this was not prominently raised when she entered the U.S. Senate or the Department of State -- because of the china , silverware and furniture that she and her husband took from the White House in January 2001 . )
Clinton may also have committed espionage by failing to secure the government secrets entrusted to her . She did that by diverting those secrets to an unprotected , nongovernmental venue -- her own server -- and again by emailing those secrets to other unprotected and nongovernmental venues . The reason she can deny sending or receiving anything marked `` classified ” is that protected government secrets are not marked “ classified . ”
So her statement , though technically true , is highly misleading . The governmental designations of protected secrets are “ confidential , ” “ secret ” and “ top secret ” -- not “ classified. ” State Department investigators have found 999 emails sent or received by Clinton in at least one of those three categories of protected secrets .
Back when Clinton became secretary of state , on her first day in office , she had an hourlong FBI briefing on the proper and lawfully required care of government secrets . She signed a statement , under penalty of perjury , acknowledging that she knew the law and that it is the content of emails , not any stamped markings , that makes them secret .
Earlier this week , my Fox News colleagues confirmed the certain presence of top-secret materials among the 999 emails . Intelligence from foreign sources or about foreign governments is always top-secret , whether designated as such or not . And she knows that .
As well , she may have committed perjury in the FOIA case . When the House Select Committee on Benghazi , in its investigation of her role in the deaths of the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans , gathered emails , it found emails she did not surrender to the State Department .
Last week , the State Department released emails that give the FBI more areas to investigate . These emails may show a pattern of official behavior by Clinton designed to benefit the financial interests of her family 's foundation , her husband and her son-in-law . Moreover , the FBI knows of a treasure-trove of documents that may demonstrate that the Clinton Foundation skirted the law and illegally raised and spent contributions .

fbi,Washington Times,2,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jun/9/washington-story-fast-tracked-reporter-her-source-/,"A real life 'House of Cards': a fast-tracked reporter, her source and their illicit romance",2018-06-09,Rowan Scarborough,"Reporter Ali Watkins , age 22 , made an immediate imprint on Washington journalism in 2014 , helping McClatchy News win Pulitzer honors for an insider story about the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence .
What is known today is that in December 2013 , the Temple University intern had begun a romantic relationship with James A. Wolfe , a man 30 years her senior . He happened to sit amid a flow of juicy information as director of security for the same Senate committee . The reporter-source romance would last four years . Then the FBI intervened .
From McClatchy , she went on to land jobs in quick succession at HuffPost , BuzzFeed , Politico and finally the New York Times , where she resides today at the Washington bureau .
A Justice Department indictment released Friday spells out the Watkins-Wolfe timeline . Ms. Watkins and Mr. Wolfe , 57 , exchanged thousands of messages , some encrypted . They met at secluded spots , including Senate office stairwells , restaurants and her apartment .
The relationship ended in December 2017 , the same month the New York Times hired her . FBI agents confronted Mr. Wolfe about leaking classified information to reporters . He denied the allegations , despite mounds of two-way messages seized by the FBI . Agents showed him a photo of the couple together .
The indictment charges Mr. Wolfe , who had maintained a low-profile with the committee since the Ronald Reagan years , on three counts of making false statements .
Back in early 2014 , the town marveled at a college intern ’ s role in such big scoop — the CIA intrusively monitored Senate computers as staffers for Sen. Dianne Feinstein , California Democrat , combed thousands of top secret memos on enhanced interrogations of captured terror suspects .
The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that March , “ Ali Watkins , currently a 22-year-old freelancer for McClatchy in Washington , D.C. , received a tip from sources who came to trust her while making herself a presence on Capitol Hill , according to a posting by Temple ’ s School of Media and Communication . ”
“ To me , this story stands as a testament to watchdog journalism , ” Ms. Watkins said .
The McClatchy Senate reporting was a finalist for the 2015 Pulitzer Prize for national reporting that went to the Washington Post . Her name and two other McClatchy reporters are listed on the Pulitzer website .
The chronology suggests Mr. Wolfe , then Ms. Watkins ‘ lover , was a source for the computer story . They had been an item for four months .
There is strong circumstantial evidence that Mr. Wolfe was also the source for a story that said Carter Page , a Trump campaign volunteer , had met with a Russian spy in New York in 2013 .
Ms. Watkins broke the story for BuzzFeed on April 3 , 2017 .
Said the lede : “ NEW YORK — A former campaign adviser for Donald Trump met with and passed documents to a Russian intelligence operative in New York City in 2013 . ”
Referring to a public indictment in New York , she wrote , “ BuzzFeed News has confirmed that “ Male-1 ” is Page . ”
The Trump administration delivered classified documents on Mr . Page to the committee on March 17 . As the safeguard of secrets , Mr. Wolfe handled the paperwork .
That day , he and Ms. Watkins exchanged scores of messages .
“ On or about March 17 , 2017 , WOLFE exchanged 82 text messages with REPORTER # 2 , [ Ms. Watkins ] and that evening engaged in a 28-minute phone call with REPORTER # 2 , ” the indictment states . “ On or about Api| 3,2017 , a news organization published an online article , under REPORTER # 2 ’ s byline , that revealed the identity of MALE-I…On or about that same date , both before and after the online news article was published , WOLFE and REPORTER # 2 exchanged approximately 124 electronic communications . ”
[ The Carter Page spy story turned out to be less than nefarious . He worked as an energy investor in New York , had lived in Moscow and was always looking for deals . The Russian spy , Victor Podobnyy , was posted under diplomatic cover at the United Nations . This is how Mr . Page briefly knew him . In 2013 , long before he became associated with Trump people , he provided Mr. Podobynn a copy of a lecture he delivered based on facts available online . Mr . Page was not charged and cooperated with the FBI . ]
Shortly before the FBI moved in last December , Mr. Wolfe wrote an ode to Ms. Watkins .

What is known today is that in December 2013, the Temple University intern had begun a romantic relationship with James A. Wolfe, a man 30 years her senior. He happened to sit amid a flow of juicy information as director of security for the same Senate committee. The reporter-source romance would last four years. Then the FBI intervened.

From McClatchy, she went on to land jobs in quick succession at HuffPost, BuzzFeed, Politico and finally the New York Times, where she resides today at the Washington bureau.

A Justice Department indictment released Friday spells out the Watkins-Wolfe timeline. Ms. Watkins and Mr. Wolfe, 57, exchanged thousands of messages, some encrypted. They met at secluded spots, including Senate office stairwells, restaurants and her apartment.

The relationship ended in December 2017, the same month the New York Times hired her. FBI agents confronted Mr. Wolfe about leaking classified information to reporters. He denied the allegations, despite mounds of two-way messages seized by the FBI. Agents showed him a photo of the couple together.

The indictment charges Mr. Wolfe, who had maintained a low-profile with the committee since the Ronald Reagan years, on three counts of making false statements.

Back in early 2014, the town marveled at a college intern’s role in such big scoop — the CIA intrusively monitored Senate computers as staffers for Sen. Dianne Feinstein, California Democrat, combed thousands of top secret memos on enhanced interrogations of captured terror suspects.

The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that March, “Ali Watkins, currently a 22-year-old freelancer for McClatchy in Washington, D.C., received a tip from sources who came to trust her while making herself a presence on Capitol Hill, according to a posting by Temple’s School of Media and Communication.”

“To me, this story stands as a testament to watchdog journalism,” Ms. Watkins said.

The McClatchy Senate reporting was a finalist for the 2015 Pulitzer Prize for national reporting that went to the Washington Post. Her name and two other McClatchy reporters are listed on the Pulitzer website.

The chronology suggests Mr. Wolfe, then Ms. Watkins‘ lover, was a source for the computer story. They had been an item for four months.

There is strong circumstantial evidence that Mr. Wolfe was also the source for a story that said Carter Page, a Trump campaign volunteer, had met with a Russian spy in New York in 2013.

Ms. Watkins broke the story for BuzzFeed on April 3, 2017.

Said the lede: “NEW YORK — A former campaign adviser for Donald Trump met with and passed documents to a Russian intelligence operative in New York City in 2013.”

Referring to a public indictment in New York, she wrote, “BuzzFeed News has confirmed that “Male-1” is Page.”

The Trump administration delivered classified documents on Mr. Page to the committee on March 17. As the safeguard of secrets, Mr. Wolfe handled the paperwork.

That day, he and Ms. Watkins exchanged scores of messages.

“On or about March 17, 2017, WOLFE exchanged 82 text messages with REPORTER #2, [Ms. Watkins] and that evening engaged in a 28-minute phone call with REPORTER #2,” the indictment states. “On or about Api| 3,2017, a news organization published an online article, under REPORTER #2’s byline, that revealed the identity of MALE-I…On or about that same date, both before and after the online news article was published, WOLFE and REPORTER #2 exchanged approximately 124 electronic communications.”

[The Carter Page spy story turned out to be less than nefarious. He worked as an energy investor in New York, had lived in Moscow and was always looking for deals. The Russian spy, Victor Podobnyy, was posted under diplomatic cover at the United Nations. This is how Mr. Page briefly knew him. In 2013, long before he became associated with Trump people, he provided Mr. Podobynn a copy of a lecture he delivered based on facts available online. Mr. Page was not charged and cooperated with the FBI.]

Shortly before the FBI moved in last December, Mr. Wolfe wrote an ode to Ms. Watkins.

“I’ve watched your career take off even before you ever had a career in journalism,” he said, according to the indictment. “I always tried to give you as much information that I could and to do the right thing with it so you could get that scoop before anyone else…I always enjoyed the way that you would pursue a story, like nobody else was doing in my hallway. I felt like I was part of your excitement and was always very supportive of your career and the tenacity that you exhibited to chase down a good story.”

The indictment alleges Mr. Wolfe leaked to other reporters.

On October 16, using the encrypted messaging app Signal, he informed a reporter identified as No. 3 that he had served a subpoena on Mr. Page.

The next day the reporter asked for contact information.

The story broke the afternoon of Oct. 17. Based on an online search it appears that NBC first reported the subpoena under the bylines of two reporters.

Said the NBC story, “The Senate Intelligence Committee has subpoenaed documents and testimony from Carter Page as part of its investigation of Russia’s alleged intervention in the 2016 election, a source directly familiar with the matter told NBC News.”

When contacted by reporters about the subpoena, Mr. Page complained about a report he deemed inaccurate that said he planned to invoke the Fifth Amendment instead of testifying. That story was written Oct. 10, 2017, by Ms. Watkins for Politico, citing a single source.

The New York Times cited Ms. Watkins‘ Page stories when it announced hiring the 26-year-old in December 2017.

What's going on?

According to the Journal's report, Andrew Weissmann, who is leading the probe's Paul Manafort and Rick Gates cases, both attended Hillary Clinton's election night party at the Javits Center in New York City and praised Sally Yates' efforts to thwart President Donald Trump.

The revelations are significant because Weissmann is considered to be the most senior investigator in the probe second only to Mueller. The New York Times even described Weissmann as Mueller's ""pit bull"" and ""lieutenant.""

Weissmann's apparent political bias, along with the bias of FBI agent Peter Strzok — who was removed from Mueller's probe months ago for exchanging anti-Trump text messages with an FBI lawyer whom he was having an affair with — has many accusing the Trump-Russia probe of being politically motivated and biased.

Rep. Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), who sits on the House Judiciary Committee, called the ""depths of this anti-Trump bias"" on Mueller's team ""absolutely shocking.""

What are the details?

Judicial Watch obtained an email this week that revealed exactly what Weissmann wrote to then-Acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates on Jan. 30 after she instructed the Department of Justice not to defend Trump's controversial travel ban.

""I am so proud. And in awe. Thank you so much. All my deepest respect,"" Weissmann wrote. In the subject line of the email, he wrote: ""I am so proud.""

At the time Weissmann wrote the email, he was running the DOJ's fraud section, according to the Journal.

Weissmann has also given thousands of dollars to Democratic campaigns, including Barack Obama's 2008 campaign and the Democratic National Committee in 2006.

Should Weissmann step away?

According to Ari Fleischer, who was George W. Bush's press secretary, Weissmann should:

Is that it?

A third member of Mueller's team, Jeannie Rhee, has raised suspicions of political bias this week after it was reported she previously represented former top Obama adviser Ben Rhodes, according to Fox News.

Editor's note: This story originally reported that Andrew Weissmann is an FBI agent. However, that is incorrect. While Robert Mueller did appoint Weissmann to a management role in his Russia investigation, Weissmann officially works as the head of the criminal fraud section at the DOJ. To assume his role on Mueller's team, Weissmann had to take a leave from that post. Prior to that, he worked as a U.S. District attorney in New York, other various roles within the DOJ and in private practice at the New York law firm Jenner & Block.",www.theblaze.com,right,y2WhuXizxNTOCAXZ

Hearing provides fodder for Trump, allies

The inspector general turned up evidence that an FBI lawyer altered a document in connection with a renewal application for the Page warrant, a detail that Trump and Republicans have seized on.

fbi,Christian Science Monitor,1,http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2016/0616/Orlando-shows-how-terror-is-changing.-Can-FBI-keep-up,Orlando shows how terror is changing. Can FBI keep up?,2016-06-16,Laurent Belsie,"In a single moment , the Orlando shooting brought together three of the most contentious issues in the United States .
Within 12 hours of the attack , President Obama disparaged lax gun laws , Donald Trump tweeted about radical Islamic terrorism , and gay and lesbian celebrities decried a hate crime that took the lives of 49 people at a popular gay nightclub .
In the days since the attack , it has become increasingly clear that the actions of Omar Mateen did not fit into a single category of hate crime , mass shooting , or jihadist terror .
“ I would call it a hate crime . I would call it terrorism . It ’ s both , ” said Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Ronald Hopper on Wednesday .
The question for federal officials now is : How should they respond ?
Orlando is further evidence that the nature of terrorism in the US is changing , making the job of federal investigators harder .
The Islamic State , in particular , is less concerned with strategic goals than simply spreading fear as widely as possible . It preys on any disgruntled Muslim angry enough to pick up a gun .
It doesn ’ t require them to go to Syria for training . It doesn ’ t require them to talk to jihadists online for instructions . It doesn ’ t require them even to know how to build bombs ; guns will suffice .
Federal agencies are coping with this evolving threat . But the fact that Mateen was investigated twice by the FBI but not stopped speaks to vulnerabilities . Without more resources to cope with an exploding caseload , federal agencies will be hard-pressed to do more .
For this reason , the ultimate solution lies in fixing the issues in American society that are giving rise to lone wolf terrorists , some say .
There have been signs this was coming . “ The threat has changed from simply worrying about foreigners coming here , to worrying about people in the United States , ” said then-Attorney General Eric Holder to ABC News in 2010 . “ You didn ’ t worry about this even two years ago – about individuals , about Americans , to the extent that we now do . ”
What 's made the issue much more urgent is the rise of Islamic State and its approach to terrorism . While Al Qaeda aimed at winning the hearts and minds of Muslims , the Islamic State is determined to scare them – and everyone else – into submission .
“ Most people , al-Qaeda ’ s leaders among them , can ’ t imagine that political success could come from enraging the masses rather than charming them , ” wrote William McCants , a terrorism expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington , in a Politico article last year .
Since the goal is pure terror , there 's no need for spectacular , highly planned attacks like 9/11 . Any act of mass violence will do . Proper training is no longer a must , only the will to commit violence .
“ The biggest change in terrorism since 9/11 is the jihadists ’ embrace of mass shootings , ” Mr. McCants writes in an e-mail . “ They , like many other terrorists , used to be fixated on building bombs . But they ’ ve learned that mass shootings are easier to organize without detection and generate just as much media attention . ISIS has been exceptionally good at inspiring young men to carry out these attacks in its name . ”
Mateen , an American citizen born to Afghan parents in New York , offers a picture of the difficulties in sniffing out such terrorists .
The FBI put him on a watch list in May 2013 after he made comments to coworkers claiming he had family and friends affiliated with Hezbollah and Al Qaeda . ( That seemed unlikely since the two groups are enemies . )
Agents interviewed him twice before closing the investigation in March 2014 with too little evidence , according to FBI Director James Comey .
Mateen again came to their attention shortly afterward when the agency found he attended the same mosque as a Syrian suicide bomber . Again , the investigation was closed when the agency found “ no ties of consequence , ” according to Director Comey .
So , two years later , when Mateen walked into the St. Lucie ( Fla. ) Shooting Center to purchase a semiautomatic rifle and pistol , it raised no flags . He had the valid licenses . He passed the background check .
The owner of a different local gun store , however , says that his employees refused to sell Mateen body armor and bulk ammunition after he began asking `` suspicious '' questions , according to ABC News . Robert Abell of Lotus Gunworks in Jensen Beach , Fla. , says he contacted authorities about Mateen before the massacre ; the FBI did not respond to ABC News 's request for comment .
In its defense , the FBI notes that it is already stepping up antiterror efforts . As of last fall , there were some 900 active investigations of ISIS sympathizers who live in the United States , according to the report from George Washington University ’ s Program on Extremism . Last year , officials arrested 56 of them , the highest number of terror-related arrests in any year since the 9/11 terror attacks .
Yet the FBI has to walk a fine line , says Seamus Hughes , deputy director of the program and coauthor of the report . The FBI investigates thousands of potential domestic terrorists at any given time , the vast majority of whom never plan a terrorist act .
Frances Townsend , who served as Homeland Security adviser to President George W. Bush , worries that the current guidelines for domestic counterterror investigations may constrain investigators . Specifically , she says they harm agents ’ ability to include social media activity and postings in their investigations .
“ We have to make sure we don ’ t let the attorney general ’ s guidelines become what ‘ the wall ’ was to 9/11 , ” said Ms. Townsend , referring to the firewall preventing the sharing of information among intelligence agencies that existed before the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
But even if everything works , there ’ s an element of guesswork in figuring out who will move from being a mere sympathizer to taking up arms . “ In most cases the motivations are complicated , ” says Mr. Hughes at George Washington University . “ People are complex and they do things for a variety of reasons . ”
That ’ s certainly true for Mateen , who proclaimed allegiance to ISIS in a 911 call during the shooting and often angrily denounced gays to friends and family , but also frequently attended the gay nightclub he attacked , according to reports .
Addressing the rising lone wolf threat isn ’ t just a matter of what can and can ’ t be done in an investigation but will almost certainly entail additional resources , said Ms. Townsend .
“ The question is , if we want the FBI to cover more threats , do we give the FBI more resources , more agents ? ” she asked in a conference call with reporters Monday .
Others suggest that the answers could lie beyond law enforcement alone .

I think there ’ s always going to be a reevaluation . ”","In a single moment, the Orlando shooting brought together three of the most contentious issues in the United States.

Within 12 hours of the attack, President Obama disparaged lax gun laws, Donald Trump tweeted about radical Islamic terrorism, and gay and lesbian celebrities decried a hate crime that took the lives of 49 people at a popular gay nightclub.

In the days since the attack, it has become increasingly clear that the actions of Omar Mateen did not fit into a single category of hate crime, mass shooting, or jihadist terror.

“I would call it a hate crime. I would call it terrorism. It’s both,” said Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Ronald Hopper on Wednesday.

The question for federal officials now is: How should they respond?

Orlando is further evidence that the nature of terrorism in the US is changing, making the job of federal investigators harder.

The Islamic State, in particular, is less concerned with strategic goals than simply spreading fear as widely as possible. It preys on any disgruntled Muslim angry enough to pick up a gun.

It doesn’t require them to go to Syria for training. It doesn’t require them to talk to jihadists online for instructions. It doesn’t require them even to know how to build bombs; guns will suffice.

Federal agencies are coping with this evolving threat. But the fact that Mateen was investigated twice by the FBI but not stopped speaks to vulnerabilities. Without more resources to cope with an exploding caseload, federal agencies will be hard-pressed to do more.

For this reason, the ultimate solution lies in fixing the issues in American society that are giving rise to lone wolf terrorists, some say.

There have been signs this was coming. “The threat has changed from simply worrying about foreigners coming here, to worrying about people in the United States,” said then-Attorney General Eric Holder to ABC News in 2010. “You didn’t worry about this even two years ago – about individuals, about Americans, to the extent that we now do.”

The mutations of terrror

What's made the issue much more urgent is the rise of Islamic State and its approach to terrorism. While Al Qaeda aimed at winning the hearts and minds of Muslims, the Islamic State is determined to scare them – and everyone else – into submission.

“Most people, al-Qaeda’s leaders among them, can’t imagine that political success could come from enraging the masses rather than charming them,” wrote William McCants, a terrorism expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington, in a Politico article last year.

Since the goal is pure terror, there's no need for spectacular, highly planned attacks like 9/11. Any act of mass violence will do. Proper training is no longer a must, only the will to commit violence.

“The biggest change in terrorism since 9/11 is the jihadists’ embrace of mass shootings,” Mr. McCants writes in an e-mail. “They, like many other terrorists, used to be fixated on building bombs. But they’ve learned that mass shootings are easier to organize without detection and generate just as much media attention. ISIS has been exceptionally good at inspiring young men to carry out these attacks in its name.”

Portrait of a lone wolf

Mateen, an American citizen born to Afghan parents in New York, offers a picture of the difficulties in sniffing out such terrorists.

The FBI put him on a watch list in May 2013 after he made comments to coworkers claiming he had family and friends affiliated with Hezbollah and Al Qaeda. (That seemed unlikely since the two groups are enemies.)

Agents interviewed him twice before closing the investigation in March 2014 with too little evidence, according to FBI Director James Comey.

Mateen again came to their attention shortly afterward when the agency found he attended the same mosque as a Syrian suicide bomber. Again, the investigation was closed when the agency found “no ties of consequence,” according to Director Comey.

So, two years later, when Mateen walked into the St. Lucie (Fla.) Shooting Center to purchase a semiautomatic rifle and pistol, it raised no flags. He had the valid licenses. He passed the background check.

The owner of a different local gun store, however, says that his employees refused to sell Mateen body armor and bulk ammunition after he began asking ""suspicious"" questions, according to ABC News. Robert Abell of Lotus Gunworks in Jensen Beach, Fla., says he contacted authorities about Mateen before the massacre; the FBI did not respond to ABC News's request for comment.

How the FBI is responding

In its defense, the FBI notes that it is already stepping up antiterror efforts. As of last fall, there were some 900 active investigations of ISIS sympathizers who live in the United States, according to the report from George Washington University’s Program on Extremism. Last year, officials arrested 56 of them, the highest number of terror-related arrests in any year since the 9/11 terror attacks.

Yet the FBI has to walk a fine line, says Seamus Hughes, deputy director of the program and coauthor of the report. The FBI investigates thousands of potential domestic terrorists at any given time, the vast majority of whom never plan a terrorist act.

Deciding where to draw those lines is difficult.

Frances Townsend, who served as Homeland Security adviser to President George W. Bush, worries that the current guidelines for domestic counterterror investigations may constrain investigators. Specifically, she says they harm agents’ ability to include social media activity and postings in their investigations.

“We have to make sure we don’t let the attorney general’s guidelines become what ‘the wall’ was to 9/11,” said Ms. Townsend, referring to the firewall preventing the sharing of information among intelligence agencies that existed before the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

But even if everything works, there’s an element of guesswork in figuring out who will move from being a mere sympathizer to taking up arms. “In most cases the motivations are complicated,” says Mr. Hughes at George Washington University. “People are complex and they do things for a variety of reasons.”

That’s certainly true for Mateen, who proclaimed allegiance to ISIS in a 911 call during the shooting and often angrily denounced gays to friends and family, but also frequently attended the gay nightclub he attacked, according to reports.

Addressing the rising lone wolf threat isn’t just a matter of what can and can’t be done in an investigation but will almost certainly entail additional resources, said Ms. Townsend.

“The question is, if we want the FBI to cover more threats, do we give the FBI more resources, more agents?” she asked in a conference call with reporters Monday.

Looking beyond law enforcement

Others suggest that the answers could lie beyond law enforcement alone.

Many lone wolf terrorists are driven to suicide for the same reasons that ordinary people are, as they try to cope with depression and marital strife, argues Adam Lankford, a University of Alabama criminology professor and author of a 2013 book, “The Myth of Martyrdom.”

“The Orlando shooter and many mass shooters fall within this demographic and seek to die, even when they claim to be ‘martyrs’ or attempt to hide their psychological pain,” says Mr. Lankford, via e-mail. “If we can make major progress on reducing suicides and helping people with suicidal thoughts, that would be an incredibly important step for America, and I believe a side effect would be a reduction in mass shootings.”

Another option is a comprehensive preventative approach to radicalization, argues Hughes of George Washington University. “You have a number of cases where there’s not enough evidence to prosecute, but the FBI is still concerned about the individual.”

That would mean targeted intervention from other groups than law enforcement. For example, the World Organization for Resource Development and Education has developed an innovative program in Maryland's Montgomery County that aims to empower community members to intervene with vulnerable youth before they choose a path of violence.

In addition , companies involved have provided CNN with new explanations that at times conflict with each other and still do n't fully explain what happened .
The story -- of a possible connection between computer servers -- is a strange tale because there are no specific allegations of wrongdoing and only vague technical evidence .
Internet data shows that last summer , a computer server owned by Russia-based Alfa Bank repeatedly looked up the contact information for a computer server being used by the Trump Organization -- far more than other companies did , representing 80 % of all lookups to the Trump server .
It 's unclear if the Trump Organization server itself did anything in return . No one has produced evidence that the servers actually communicated .
The Times said the FBI had concluded there could be an `` innocuous explanation . '' And cybersecurity experts told CNN this is n't how two entities would communicate if they wanted to keep things secret .
But for those who have studied the data , the activity could suggest an intent to communicate by email during a period of time when ties between the Trump Organization and Russia are being closely scrutinized because of Russia 's alleged involvement in hacking the emails of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign chief John Podesta .
This issue intrigued a dozen computer researchers at a recent business conference in Washington , D.C. that pulled together the world 's top network operators , the ones who help run the internet . To them , it 's a strange coincidence that merits further scrutiny .
Another computer researcher , Richard Clayton of Cambridge University , said it 's just plain weird .
`` It 's not so much a smoking gun as a faint whiff of smoke a long way away . Maybe there 's something else going on . It 's hard to tell , '' said Clayton , who has independently examined the scant evidence available .
Last year , a small group of computer scientists obtained internet traffic records from the complex system that serves as the internet 's phone book . Access to these records is reserved for highly trusted cybersecurity firms and companies that provide this lookup service .
These signals were captured as they traveled along the internet 's Domain Name System ( DNS ) .
These leaked records show that Alfa Bank servers repeatedly looked up the unique internet address of a particular Trump Organization computer server in the United States .
In the computer world , it 's the equivalent of looking up someone 's phone number -- over and over again . While there is n't necessarily a phone call , it usually indicates an intention to communicate , according to several computer scientists .
What puzzled them was why a Russian bank was repeatedly looking up the contact information for mail1.trump-email.com .
Publicly available internet records show that address , which was registered to the Trump Organization , points to an IP address that lives on an otherwise dull machine operated by a company in the tiny rural town of Lititz , Pennsylvania .
From May 4 until September 23 , the Russian bank looked up the address to this Trump corporate server 2,820 times -- more lookups than the Trump server received from any other source .
As noted , Alfa Bank alone represents 80 % of the lookups , according to these leaked internet records .
Far back in second place , with 714 such lookups , was a company called Spectrum Health .
Spectrum is a medical facility chain led by Dick DeVos , the husband of Betsy DeVos , who was appointed by Trump as U.S. education secretary .
Together , Alfa and Spectrum accounted for 99 % of the lookups .
This server behavior alarmed one computer expert who had privileged access to this technical information last year . That person , who remains anonymous and goes by the moniker `` Tea Leaves , '' obtained this information from internet traffic meant to remain private .

Tea Leaves gave that data to a small band of computer scientists who joined forces to examine it , several members of that group told CNN , which has also reviewed the data .

Alfa Bank has maintained that the most likely explanation is that the server communication was the result of spam marketing . Bank executives have stayed at Trump hotels , so it 's possible they got subsequent spam marketing emails from the Trump Organization . Those emails might have set off defensive cybersecurity measures at the bank , whose servers would respond with a cautious DNS lookup . Alfa Bank said it used antispam software from Trend Micro , whose tools would do a DNS lookup to know the source of the spam .
Alfa Bank said it brought U.S. cybersecurity firm Mandiant to Moscow to investigate . Mandiant had a `` working hypothesis '' that the activity was `` caused by email marketing/spam '' on the Trump server 's end , according to representatives for Alfa Bank and Mandiant . The private investigation is now over , Alfa Bank said .
Computer scientists agree that such an explanation is possible in theory . But they want to see evidence .
Alfa Bank and Mandiant could not point to marketing emails from the time period in question . `` Mandiant has found evidence of an old marketing campaign , which ... is too old to be relevant , '' Alfa Bank said in a statement .
CNN reached out to the Trump Organization with detailed technical questions but has not received answers .
Cendyn is the contractor that once operated marketing software on that Trump email domain . In February , it provided CNN a Trump Organization statement that called the internet records `` incomplete '' and stressed that they do not show any signs of `` two-way email communication . '' That statement lends credibility to the spam marketing theory , because it says the Trump server was set up in 2010 to deliver promotional marketing emails for Trump Hotels . But Cendyn acknowledged that the last marketing email it delivered for Trump 's corporation was sent in March 2016 , `` well before the date range in question . ''
Spectrum Health told CNN it `` did find a small number of incoming spam marketing emails '' from `` Cendyn , advertising Trump Hotels . '' But it pointed to emails sent in 2015 , long before the May-through-September 2016 time period examined by scientists . Spectrum Health said that it `` has not been contacted by the FBI or any government agency on this matter . ''
Having the Trump Organization server set up for marketing also does n't explain why Alfa Bank and Spectrum would stand out so much .
`` If it were spam , then a lot of other organizations would be doing DNS lookups . There would be evidence of widespread connectivity with devices , '' said L. Jean Camp , a computer scientist at Indiana University who has studied the data .
Cendyn has also provided another possible explanation , suggesting a highly technical case of mistaken identity .
Cendyn routinely repurposes computer servers -- like the one used by the Trump Organization .
Cendyn 's software , like its event planning tool Metron , sends email and thus relies on the 20 different email servers rented by the company . After `` a thorough network analysis , '' Cendyn has said that it found a bank client had used Metron to communicate with AlfaBank.com .
But Alfa Bank starkly denies `` any dealings with Cendyn . '' And , it says , it 's unlikely that it received any emails from that server . `` Mandiant investigated 12 months of email archives and it found no emails to or from any of the IP addresses given to us by the media . ''
On Wednesday , Cendyn provided another explanation to CNN . Cendyn claims the Trump Hotel Collection ditched Cendyn and went with another email marketing company , the German firm Serenata , in March 2016 . Cendyn said it `` transferred back to '' Trump 's company the mail1.trump-email.com domain .
Serenata this week told CNN it was indeed hired by Trump Hotels , but it `` never has operated or made use of '' the domain in question : mail1.trump-email.com .
Upon hearing that Cendyn gave up control of the Trump email domain , Camp , said : `` That does not make any sense to me at all . The more confusing this is , the more I think we need an investigation . ''
Other computer experts said there could be additional lookups that were n't captured by the original leak . That could mean that Alfa 's presence is n't as dominant as it seems . But Dyn , which has a major presence on the internet 's domain name system , spotted only two such lookups — from the Netherlands on August 15 .
Alfa Bank insists that it has no connections to Trump . In a statement to CNN , Alfa Bank said neither it , bank cofounder Mikhail Fridman and bank president Petr Aven `` have had any contact with Mr. Trump or his organizations . Fridman and Aven have never met Mr. Trump nor have they or Alfa Bank had any business dealings with him . Neither Alfa Bank nor its officers have sent Mr. Trump or his organization any emails , information or money . Alfa Bank does not have and has never had any special or exclusive internet connection with Mr. Trump or his entities . ''
The bank told CNN it is now trying to identify the person or entity who disseminated this internet traffic . `` We believe that DNS traffic in mainland Europe was deliberately captured - in a manner that is unethical and possibly illegal -- in order to manufacture the deceit , '' it said .
Fear has now silenced several of the computer scientists who first analyzed the data .
Tea Leaves refused to be interviewed by CNN and is now `` hiding under a rock , '' according to an intermediary contact .
Paul Vixie , who helped design the very DNS system the internet uses today , was quoted in the Slate story saying that Alfa Bank and the Trump Organization `` were communicating in a secretive fashion . '' Vixie declined to go on the record with CNN .
Robert Graham is a cybersecurity expert who wrote a widely circulated blog post in November that criticized computer scientists for premature conclusions connecting the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank .
But he 's still wondering why Alfa Bank and Spectrum Health alone dominated links to this Trump server .
`` It 's indicative of communication between Trump , the health organization and the bank outside these servers , '' he told CNN . `` There is some sort of connection I ca n't explain , and only they are doing it . It could be completely innocent .

Other computer experts said there could be additional lookups that weren't captured by the original leak. That could mean that Alfa's presence isn't as dominant as it seems. But Dyn, which has a major presence on the internet's domain name system, spotted only two such lookups — from the Netherlands on August 15.

Alfa Bank insists that it has no connections to Trump. In a statement to CNN, Alfa Bank said neither it, bank cofounder Mikhail Fridman and bank president Petr Aven ""have had any contact with Mr. Trump or his organizations. Fridman and Aven have never met Mr. Trump nor have they or Alfa Bank had any business dealings with him. Neither Alfa Bank nor its officers have sent Mr. Trump or his organization any emails, information or money. Alfa Bank does not have and has never had any special or exclusive internet connection with Mr. Trump or his entities.""

Scientists now silent

The bank told CNN it is now trying to identify the person or entity who disseminated this internet traffic. ""We believe that DNS traffic in mainland Europe was deliberately captured - in a manner that is unethical and possibly illegal -- in order to manufacture the deceit,"" it said.

Fear has now silenced several of the computer scientists who first analyzed the data.

Tea Leaves refused to be interviewed by CNN and is now ""hiding under a rock,"" according to an intermediary contact.

Paul Vixie, who helped design the very DNS system the internet uses today, was quoted in the Slate story saying that Alfa Bank and the Trump Organization ""were communicating in a secretive fashion."" Vixie declined to go on the record with CNN.

Even the skeptics have unanswered questions.

Robert Graham is a cybersecurity expert who wrote a widely circulated blog post in November that criticized computer scientists for premature conclusions connecting the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank.

But he's still wondering why Alfa Bank and Spectrum Health alone dominated links to this Trump server.

""It's indicative of communication between Trump, the health organization and the bank outside these servers,"" he told CNN. ""There is some sort of connection I can't explain, and only they are doing it. It could be completely innocent.""",www.cnn.com,left,veKRrvyFDcqGdwdK

One of the media and beltway orthodoxies we constantly hear is that just a few bad apples under James Comey at the FBI explain why so many FBI elites have been fired , resigned , reassigned , demoted , or retired — or just left for unexplained reasons . The list is long and includes director James Comey himself , deputy director Andrew McCabe , counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok , attorney Lisa Page , chief of staff James Rybicki , general counsel James Baker , assistant director for public affairs Mike Kortan , Comey ’ s special assistant Josh Campbell , executive assistant director James Turgal , assistant director for office of congressional affairs Greg Bower , executive assistant director Michael Steinbach , and executive assistant director John Giacalone . In short , in about every growing scandal of the past two years — FISA , illegal leaking , spying on a presidential candidate , lying under oath , obstructing justice — someone in the FBI is involved .
We are told , however , that the FBI ’ s culture and institutions are exempt from the widespread wrongdoing at the top . Such caution is a fine and fitting thing , given the FBI ’ s more than a century of public service . Nonetheless , many of those caught up in the controversies over the Russian-collusion hoax were not recent career appointees . Rather , many came up through the ranks of the FBI . And that raises the question , for example , of where exactly Peter Strzok ( 22 years in the FBI ) learned that he had a right to interfere in a U.S. election to damage a candidate that he opposed .
And why would an Andrew McCabe ( over 21 years in the FBI ) think he had the duty to formulate an “ insurance policy ” to take out a presidential candidate ? Or why would he even consider overseeing an FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton ’ s improper use of emails when his wife had been a recent recipient of Clinton-related PAC money ? And why would McCabe contemplate leaking confidential FBI information to the press or even dream of setting up some sort of operation to remove a sitting president under the 25th Amendment ? And how did someone like the old FBI vet Peter Strozk ever end up at the center of the entire mess — opening up the snooping on the Trump campaign while hiding that fact and while briefing the candidate on Russian interference in the election , interviewing Michael Flynn , preening as a top FBI investigator for Robert Mueller ’ s dream team , right-hand man of “ Andy ” McCabe , convincing Comey to change the wording of his writ in the Clinton-email-scandal investigation , softball coddling of Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills , instrumental in the Papadopoulos investigation con — all the while conducting an affair with fellow FBI investigator and attorney Lisa Page and bragging about his assurance that the supposedly odious Trump would be prevented from being elected . If a group of Trump zealots were to call up the FBI tomorrow and allege that a member of Joe Biden ’ s family has had unethical ties with the Ukrainian or Chinese government , would that gambit “ alarm ” the FBI enough to prompt an investigation of Biden and his campaign ? How many career-professional Peter Strozks are still at the agency ?
In sum , why did so many top FBI officials , some with long experience in the FBI , exhibit such bad judgment and display such unethical behavior , characterized by arrogance , a sense of entitlement , and a belief that they were above both the law and the Constitution itself ? Were they really just rogue agents , lawyers , and administrators , or are they emblematic of an FBI culture sorely gone wrong ?
How and why would James Comey believe that as a private citizen he had the right to leak classified memos of presidential conversations that he had recorded on FBI time and on FBI machines ?
Does the FBI inculcate behavior that prompts its officials to repeatedly testify under oath that they either don ’ t know or can ’ t remember — in a fashion that would earn an indictment for most similarly interrogated private citizens ? Was Strozk ’ s testimony to the Congress emblematic of a career FBI agent in his full ? Was Comey ’ s ? Was McCabe ’ s ?
To answer those questions , perhaps we can turn to an analogous example of special counsel and former FBI director Robert Mueller . We are always advised something to the effect that the admirable Vietnam War veteran and career DOJ and FBI administrator Bob Mueller has a sterling reputation , and thus we were to assume that his special-counsel investigation would be free from political bias . To suggest otherwise was to be slapped down as a rank demagogue of the worse kind .
But how true were those beltway narratives ? Mueller himself had a long checkered prosecutorial and investigative career , involving questionable decisions about the use of FBI informants in Boston , and overseeing absolutely false FBI accusations against an innocent suspect in the sensationalized anthrax case that began shortly after 9/11 .
The entire Mueller investigation did not reflect highly either on Mueller or the number of former and current DOJ and FBI personnel he brought on to his team . In a politically charged climate , Mueller foolishly hired an inordinate number of political partisans , some of whom had donated to the Clinton campaign , while others had legally defended the Clinton Foundation or various Clinton and Obama aides . Mueller ’ s point-man Andrew Weissman was a known Clinton zealot with his own past record of suspect prosecutorial overreach .
Mueller did not initially disclose why FBI employees Lisa Page and Peter Strozk were taken off his investigative team , and he staggered their departures to suggest that their reassignments were normal rather than a consequence of the couple ’ s unprofessional personal behavior and their textual record of rank Trump hatred . Mueller ’ s very appointment was finessed by former FBI director and Mueller friend James Comey and was largely due to the hysteria caused by Comey ’ s likely felonious leaks of confidential and classified FBI memos — a fact of no interest to Mueller ’ s soon-to-be-expanded investigation .
During the investigation , Mueller was quite willing to examine peripheral issues such as the scoundrelly behavior of former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen and the inside lobbying of Paul Manafort for foreign governments . Fine . But Mueller was curiously more discriminating in his non-interest in crimes far closer to the allegations of Russian collusion . That is , he was certainly uninterested about how and when the basis for his entire investigation arose — the unverified and fallacious Steele dossier that had been deliberately seeded among the FBI , CIA , and DOJ to achieve official imprimaturs so it could then be leaked to the press to ruin the campaign , transition , and presidency of Donald Trump .
Mueller ’ s team also deliberately edited a phone message from Trump counsel John Dowd to Robert Kelner , General Michael Flynn ’ s lawyer , to make it appear incriminating and possibly unethical or illegal . Only after a federal judge ordered the full release of the transcript did the public learn the extent of Mueller ’ s selective and misleading cut-and-paste of Dowd ’ s message .
Mueller ’ s own explanations about the extent to which he was guided by the precedent of presidential exemption from indictment are at odds with his own prior statements and in conflict with what Attorney General Barr has reported from a meeting with Mueller and others . In those meetings , Mueller assured that he was after the truth and did not regard prior legal opinions about the illegality of indicting a sitting president as relevant to his own investigations . But when he essentially discovered he had no finding of collusion , he then mysteriously retreated to the previously rejected notion that he was powerless to indict Trump on a possible obstruction charge .
Mueller displayed further contortions when he recited a number of alleged Trump wrongdoings but then backed off by concluding that , while such evidence for a variety of different reasons did not justify an indictment of Trump , nonetheless Trump should not be exonerated of obstruction of justice .
Mueller thereby established a new but lunatic precedent in American jurisprudence in which a prosecutor who fails to find sufficient cause to indict a suspect nonetheless releases supposedly incriminating evidence , with a wink that the now-besmirched suspect can not be exonerated of the alleged crimes . Think what Mueller ’ s precedent of not-not-guilty would do to the American criminal-justice system , as zealous prosecutors might fish for just enough dirt on a suspect to ruin his reputation , but not find enough for an indictment , thereby exonerating their own prosecutorial failure by defaming a “ guilty until proven innocent ” suspect .
It is becoming increasingly apparent that Mueller ’ s team knew early on in their investigation that his lead investigators Peter Strzok and Lisa Page had been correct in their belief that there was “ no there there ” in the charges of collusion — again the raison d ’ être of their entire investigation .
Yet Mueller ’ s team continued the investigation , aggregating more than 200 pages of unverified or uncorroborated news accounts , online essays , and testimonies describing all sorts of alleged unethical behavior and infelicities by Trump and his associates , apparently in hopes of compiling their own version of something like the Steele dossier . Mueller sought to publish a compendium of Trump bad behavior that fell below the standard of criminal offense but that would nonetheless provide useful fodder for media sensationalism and congressional partisan efforts to impeach the now supposedly not-not guilty president .
Note again , at no time did Muller ever investigate the Steele dossier that had helped to create his existence as special counsel , much less whether members of the FBI and DOJ had misled a FISA court by hiding critical information about the dossier to obtain wiretaps of American citizens , texts that Mueller himself would then use in his effort to find criminal culpability .
We were told throughout the 22-month investigation that “ Bob Mueller does not leak. ” But almost on a weekly schedule , left-wing cable news serially announced in formulaic fashion that “ the walls were closing in on ” and the “ noose was tightening around ” Trump as another “ bombshell ” disclosure was anticipated , according to “ sources close to the Mueller investigation , ” “ unnamed sources , ” and “ sources who chose to remain unidentified. ” On one occasion , CNN reporters mysteriously showed up in advance at the home of a Mueller target , to capture on camera the arrival of paramilitary-like arresting officers .
When it is established beyond a doubt that foreign surveillance of and contact with George Papadopoulos was used to entrap a minor Trump aide as a means of providing an ex post facto justification for the earlier illegal FBI and CIA surveillance of the Trump campaign , and when it is shown without doubt that Steele had little if any corroborating evidence for his dirty dossier , Mueller ’ s reputation unfortunately will be further eroded .
Yet the question is not merely whether a Comey , McCabe , or Mueller is atypical of the FBI . Rather , where in the world , if not from the culture of the FBI , did these elite legal investigators absorb the dangerous idea that FBI lawyers and investigators could flout the law and in such arrogant fashion use their vast powers of the government to pursue their own political agendas ?

The Obama administration blatantly politicized the government’s intelligence and law-enforcement apparatus.

‘Isn’t it a fact that you’re a scumbag?”

Our contretemps over the nomenclature of government informants has me unable to shake this arresting moment from my memory. In Manhattan, about 30 years ago, I was among the spectators basking in the majesty of Foley Square’s federal courthouse when we were suddenly jarred by this, shall we say, rhetorical question. The sniper was a mob lawyer in a big RICO case; the target was the prosecution’s main witness, the informant.

Until this week, I’d always thought the most noteworthy thing about this obnoxious bit of theater was the reaction of the judge, a very fine, very wry trial lawyer in his own right.

The prosecutors, of course, screamed, “Objection!”

The judge calmly shrugged his shoulders and ruled: “He can answer if he knows.”

Did he know? I don’t remember. I was laughing too hard to hear any response.

The court’s deadpan was not just hilarious. In its way, it was trenchant.

The judge was not insouciant. He was a realist. The witness had done what covert informants do: He pretended to be someone he wasn’t, he wheedled his way into the trust — in some instances, into the affections — of people suspected of wrongdoing. And then he betrayed them. But that’s the job: to pry away secrets — get the bad actors to admit what they did, how they did it, and with whom they did it, until the agents and prosecutors decide there is enough evidence to convict the lot of them.

But there is another side of the story.

By and large, “confidential informants” do not emerge from the womb with a passion to protect the United States.

`` I did see President Clinton at the Phoenix airport as he was leaving and spoke to myself and my husband on the plane , '' Lynch said afterwards . `` Our conversation was a great deal about grandchildren , it was primarily social about our travels and he mentioned golf he played in Phoenix . ''
The fact remained that the former president had met in private with the country ’ s top law enforcement official when the Department of Justice was actively investigating his wife in a criminal matter . His wife being Hillary Clinton , who could quite possibly be our next president .
And , say some who know FBI Director James Comey , this left him in what he felt was an untenable situation .
Comey had essentially come to the end of the investigation and he had concluded that there was insufficient cause to charge Hillary Clinton with a crime . The usual protocol called for him then to refer the findings to the attorney general and let her make the prosecutorial decision .
But the attorney general had been sitting on a plane with the target ’ s husband less than two weeks before . And for Lynch now to announce that Hillary Clinton had been cleared would call into question the integrity of all involved , including Comey and the FBI .
Comey decided that he had to present the results directly to the public . He did so , insisting that the evidence did not establish the intent he said was necessary to bring criminal charges . He made clear that he felt Hillary Clinton had been reckless and irresponsible and that she had shown terrible judgment .
“ He wasn ’ t going to indict , but he was going to scold , ” a former federal prosecutor said on Saturday . “ Scolding in the first degree has never quite made it . ”
Along with their surprise at Comey ’ s break with protocol , some veteran agents were outraged by the decision itself . Few of them are Hillary fans . And all of them had learned from their first days the importance of treating classified materials properly . They viewed it as the highest arrogance to ignore the strictures to which they adhere .
They noted that the word “ intent ” may appear in subsection a of section 793 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code , but subsection f only speaks of anyone who “ through gross negligence ” permits classified material “ to be removed from its proper place of custody . ”
The more cynical agents wondered if Comey had compromised himself . Their anger was deepened by having held him in such high esteem going as far back as in his days as an assistant U.S attorney in New York , when he was the prosecutor the street agents all liked to begin their cases .
`` Somebody must have pictures of him with farm animals , '' half-joked one now-retired agent . “ That 's not the Jim Comey I knew . ”
But those who continued to believe in Comey were certain he had simply reached the conclusion he felt was justified by the evidence . One former FBI official said Comey is the “ most honest , forthright person I have ever met in the history of time , ” adding , “ I would go to the end of the world with Jim Comey if he asked me to do it . ”
The former official continued , “ He ’ s got a long history doing the right thing , ” noting that as deputy attorney general Comey stood up to the Bush administration , refusing to sign off on mass surveillance .
Comey ’ s continued admirers feel he was also again trying to do the right thing after the investigation into Anthony Weiner ’ s sexting with a 15-year-old girl led to a surprising discovery in the former congressman 's computer .
The investing agents were legally allowed to examine the contents of the subpoenaed computer and phone under the established principle that you can only judge the evidentiary importance of what you can see . They apparently came upon e-mails that applied not to Weiner 's case , but to Hillary ’ s .
At that moment , the investigation into Hillary was necessarily reopened . A warrant from a judge would be all that is needed to examine the emails unrelated to the Weiner case . The FBI and the Justice Department have reportedly been discussing how best to proceed .
The problem for Comey was that he had publicly declared the investigation closed three months before in circumstances required by that plane meeting . His finding had angered many “ KMA ” agents — those of retirement age who can just say “ kiss my ass. ” And , the very agents who must have been disappointed — at the very least — when all their work on the Hillary case apparently came to naught would almost certainly be put back on it when it was revived . An agent was all but sure to tip off the press that the investigation had been reopened .
Comey apparently decided that the only thing for him to do was announce that the investigation had been reopened the very way that he had earlier announced that it had been closed .
Lynch is said to have urged him not to do so , to instead keep the matter within the Department of Justice . Comey had only to look at what happened after the Department of Justice decided to take the Eric Garner case away from the New York FBI agents and prosecutors who had been working it and give it to the civil rights division in Washington . The whole thing was soon in the newspapers .
If that scenario played out in the Hillary e-mails case , Comey and the FBI would be blamed for mounting a cover-up that may have affected the outcome of a presidential election .
So Comey resolved to go ahead and make the disclosure himself . He was immediately bashed from all sides .
But he had at least regained he respect of some of the street agents , including the retired one who had known him since his first days as a junior prosecutor who announced he would “ take any dog ” — handle any case . Comey had now taken on the Dog of all Dogs which had taken another bizarre twist and , in this agent ’ s view , the FBI Director had ended up handling himself admirably .
“ What he did yesterday , that 's the guy I know , ” the agent said on Saturday .
Perhaps what matters most to Comey is that he can feel he is living up to the legacy of the deceased lawman whose photo greets him when he arrives at work .
“ My grandfather , William J. Comey , was a police officer , ” Comey has said . “ Pop Comey is one of my heroes . I have a picture of him on my wall in my office at the FBI , reminding me of the legacy I 've inherited and that I must honor . ”
The records of the Yonkers , N.Y. police show that the elder Comey rose through the ranks to lead the department . He had been just a sergeant during the Great Depression , when he organized 34 volunteer fellow cops into the `` Relief Committee of the Yonkers Police Department . ''
“ More than two thousand Yonkers individuals who were in need were supplied with food and clothing donated by police officers and local businesses , ” the Yonkers Police museum website reports . “ The programs success was a tribute to Sgt . Comey 's hard work . ”
As a detective lieutenant , the elder Comey once arrested a 22-year-old man for sexually assaulting an eight year-old girl . The victim identified the man in a line-up . The conviction was assured when the elder Comey secured a confession .
But the elder Comey would know that not all cases are so readily resolved . He might have compared the Hillary e-mail case to an event from his own days . The Yonkers police museum reports :
“ PO Comey was on his traffic post at South Broadway and McLean Avenue , an unattended runaway horse pulling a milk wagon came racing southbound and right toward a trolley . The letter further related that Comey threw his arms around the horse ’ s head as it sped by him , and directed it away from the trolley car . However in doing so the horse dragged Comey from McLean Avenue to Ludlow Street before he succeeded in bringing the animal to a stop . Fortunately neither the officer nor any bystanders were injured during the episode . ”
Only the younger Comey 's case have proven to be the Dog of all Dogs . No doubt the elder Comey would hope that his grandson will also by some miracle escape unscathed as he tries to live up to the family legacy .","Former President Bill Clinton and Attorney General Loretta Lynch insisted there was nothing improper about their little chat when their planes chanced to be in Phoenix and he strode across the tarmac to her plane.

""I did see President Clinton at the Phoenix airport as he was leaving and spoke to myself and my husband on the plane,"" Lynch said afterwards. ""Our conversation was a great deal about grandchildren, it was primarily social about our travels and he mentioned golf he played in Phoenix.""

The fact remained that the former president had met in private with the country’s top law enforcement official when the Department of Justice was actively investigating his wife in a criminal matter. His wife being Hillary Clinton, who could quite possibly be our next president.

The investing agents were legally allowed to examine the contents of the subpoenaed computer and phone under the established principle that you can only judge the evidentiary importance of what you can see. They apparently came upon e-mails that applied not to Weiner's case, but to Hillary’s.

At that moment, the investigation into Hillary was necessarily reopened. A warrant from a judge would be all that is needed to examine the emails unrelated to the Weiner case. The FBI and the Justice Department have reportedly been discussing how best to proceed.

The problem for Comey was that he had publicly declared the investigation closed three months before in circumstances required by that plane meeting. His finding had angered many “KMA” agents — those of retirement age who can just say “kiss my ass.” And, the very agents who must have been disappointed — at the very least — when all their work on the Hillary case apparently came to naught would almost certainly be put back on it when it was revived. An agent was all but sure to tip off the press that the investigation had been reopened.

Comey apparently decided that the only thing for him to do was announce that the investigation had been reopened the very way that he had earlier announced that it had been closed.

Lynch is said to have urged him not to do so, to instead keep the matter within the Department of Justice. Comey had only to look at what happened after the Department of Justice decided to take the Eric Garner case away from the New York FBI agents and prosecutors who had been working it and give it to the civil rights division in Washington. The whole thing was soon in the newspapers.

If that scenario played out in the Hillary e-mails case, Comey and the FBI would be blamed for mounting a cover-up that may have affected the outcome of a presidential election.

So Comey resolved to go ahead and make the disclosure himself. He was immediately bashed from all sides.

But he had at least regained he respect of some of the street agents, including the retired one who had known him since his first days as a junior prosecutor who announced he would “take any dog” — handle any case. Comey had now taken on the Dog of all Dogs which had taken another bizarre twist and, in this agent’s view, the FBI Director had ended up handling himself admirably.

“What he did yesterday, that's the guy I know,” the agent said on Saturday.

Perhaps what matters most to Comey is that he can feel he is living up to the legacy of the deceased lawman whose photo greets him when he arrives at work.

“My grandfather, William J. Comey, was a police officer,” Comey has said. “Pop Comey is one of my heroes. I have a picture of him on my wall in my office at the FBI, reminding me of the legacy I've inherited and that I must honor.”

The records of the Yonkers, N.Y. police show that the elder Comey rose through the ranks to lead the department. He had been just a sergeant during the Great Depression, when he organized 34 volunteer fellow cops into the ""Relief Committee of the Yonkers Police Department.""

“More than two thousand Yonkers individuals who were in need were supplied with food and clothing donated by police officers and local businesses,” the Yonkers Police museum website reports. “The programs success was a tribute to Sgt. Comey's hard work.”

As a detective lieutenant, the elder Comey once arrested a 22-year-old man for sexually assaulting an eight year-old girl. The victim identified the man in a line-up. The conviction was assured when the elder Comey secured a confession.

“Some questioning was necessary,” the Yonkers police noted.

But the elder Comey would know that not all cases are so readily resolved. He might have compared the Hillary e-mail case to an event from his own days. The Yonkers police museum reports:

“PO Comey was on his traffic post at South Broadway and McLean Avenue, an unattended runaway horse pulling a milk wagon came racing southbound and right toward a trolley. The letter further related that Comey threw his arms around the horse’s head as it sped by him, and directed it away from the trolley car. However in doing so the horse dragged Comey from McLean Avenue to Ludlow Street before he succeeded in bringing the animal to a stop. Fortunately neither the officer nor any bystanders were injured during the episode.”

Only the younger Comey's case have proven to be the Dog of all Dogs. No doubt the elder Comey would hope that his grandson will also by some miracle escape unscathed as he tries to live up to the family legacy.",www.thedailybeast.com,left,Ro7nZ6Gw5vtQlZ5U

But the tip wasn ’ t passed on or properly investigated , the FBI admitted in a statement Friday .
According to the FBI , a person close to Nikolas Cruz called in with concerns about him on January 5 , 2018 — more than a month before Wednesday ’ s massacre . The tipster described Cruz ’ s gun ownership , his “ desire to kill people , erratic behavior , and disturbing social media posts , as well as the potential of him conducting a school shooting , ” the bureau said in a statement .
The tip should have been forwarded to the Miami field office and investigated . But that didn ’ t happen , the FBI said in a statement : “ Protocols were not followed. ” The Miami field office did not receive the tip , and “ no further investigation was conducted at this time . ”

In the aftermath of the shooting , President Donald Trump appeared to blame “ neighbors and classmates ” for not reporting Cruz to authorities .

James Comey continues to supply the champagne at Hillary Clinton’s headquarters, after making sure she wouldn’t have to spend Election Night in a 5 by 7 jail cell. That wouldn’t be big enough to accommodate her pants suits.

Mr. Comey continues to shred what’s left of his reputation as a fearless tough guy eager to do the right thing. His diagnosis of Hillary’s character and competence stopped just short of doing anything about her breaking of the law. President Obama says Hillary would be the most qualified president since Thomas Jefferson, greater than Madison, Monroe, Lincoln, the two Roosevelts and presumably even his own magnificent self. But Mr. Comey says Hillary was nevertheless not “sophisticated” enough to know that she shouldn’t put the nation’s security secrets at the mercy of Russian and Chinese hackers.

But despite the FBI director’s imaginative special pleading to preserve Hillary’s presidential credentials, she’s stuck with the reputation she made for herself. Mr. Comey’s gift to Hillary of a “soiled bill of health,” as one clever headline writer put it, recalls the vote at a country church in the Arkansas of my youth, where the congregation had a falling out with the pastor. The preacher demanded a showdown with a vote of confidence. When the parson prevailed by a vote of 33 to 31, he declared victory: “This is a heartwarming vote of confidence that proves that the congregation is with me a hundred per cent.”

Hillary’s “vote of confidence” from Mr. Comey is more humiliation than vindication, because his bill of the particulars of her high crimes and misdemeanors is the indictment he was afraid to recommend to Atty. Gen. Loretta Lynch. Mzz Lynch was free to do the right thing, of course, to bring the Clintons to heel after decades of wanton corruption and debasement of the public trust. But the age of miracles is past.

Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, the chairman of the House Select Committee investigating the disgrace at Benghazi and a former federal prosecutor himself, destroyed Mr. Comey’s conclusion that because Hillary meant no harm she should be free of the punishment prescribed for others.

“In your old job [as a federal prosecutor],” he told the FBI director at a congressional hearing Thursday, “you would prove intent by showing the jury evidence of a complex scheme that was designed for the very purpose of concealing the public record, and you would be arguing in addition to concealment the destruction that you and I just talked about, or certainly the failure to preserve. Would you argue all that under heading of content — intent? You would also be arguing the pervasiveness of the scheme, when it started, when it ended and number of emails, whether they were originally classified or up-classified, you would argue all of that under the heading of intent.

“You would also, probably under common scheme or plan, argue the burn bags of daily calendar entries or the missing daily calendar entries as a common scheme or plan to conceal. Two days ago, director, you said a reasonable person should have known [that] a private email is no place to send and receive classified information. You’re right.

“An average person does know not to do that. This is no average person. This is a former first lady, a former United States senator, and a former secretary of state that the president now contends is the most competent, qualified person to be president since Jefferson … She affirmatively rejected efforts to give her a [secure government email] account. She kept these private emails for almost two years and only turned them over to Congress because we found out she had a private email account.

“So you have a rogue email system set up before she took the oath of office. Thousands of what we now know to be classified emails, some of which were classified at the time. One of her more frequent email comrades was in fact hacked, and you don’t know whether or not [Hillary] was. And this scheme took place over a long period of time and resulted in the destruction of public records yet you say there is insufficient evidence of intent.

“You say careless but not intentionally. You and I both know intent is really difficult to prove. Very rarely do defendants announce, ‘On this date I intend to break this criminal code section. Just to put everyone on notice, I am going to break the law on this date.’ It never happens that way. You have to do it with circumstantial evidence … “.

Of circumstantial evidence there is sufficient plenty. It was outweighed only by the politics of a presidential campaign.

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — President Donald Trump voiced strong support Thursday for his former national security adviser Michael Flynn , raising speculation that a pardon may be coming after Flynn ’ s lawyers disclosed internal FBI documents they claim show the FBI tried to “ intentionally frame ” him .

“ If all this proves to be true , you will have , certainly , a major , major error on the part of top leadership at the FBI , which could well warrant additional charges against them , ” he said .
Lawyers for Flynn over the last two days released a series of internal correspondence obtained through a Justice Department review of the handling of the case .

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump voiced strong support Thursday for his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, raising speculation that a pardon may be coming after Flynn’s lawyers disclosed internal FBI documents they claim show the FBI tried to “intentionally frame” him.

Trump said he believes Flynn should now be cleared in court, but if that doesn’t happen, he as president has “a different type of power.”

“It looks to me like Michael Flynn would be exonerated based on everything I see,” Trump told reporters Thursday. “I’m not the judge, but I have a different type of power. But I don’t know that anybody would have to use that power. I think he’s exonerated.”

Trump has long said he is considering pardoning Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States. The president spent Wednesday night and Thursday morning retweeting supportive statements of Flynn and condemned the FBI’s investigation into his onetime adviser

“They came at him with 15 buses and he’s standing in the middle of the highway. What they did to this man,” Trump said at an earlier event at the White House, without specifying what he meant. “They tormented him. They destroyed him. But he’s going to come back.”

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called into Fox News Channel to react to the release of the FBI documents, saying, “If true, it is extremely troubling.”

“If all this proves to be true, you will have, certainly, a major, major error on the part of top leadership at the FBI, which could well warrant additional charges against them,” he said.

Lawyers for Flynn over the last two days released a series of internal correspondence obtained through a Justice Department review of the handling of the case. They contend the documents bolster their allegations that Flynn was set up to lie when he was questioned at the White House three years ago, and show that agents were prepared to drop an investigation into him just weeks before they set out to question him.

Still, the documents don’t directly address the central allegation in the case — that Flynn lied to the FBI. It’s also unclear how much significance they will carry with the judge, who has already publicly scolded Flynn and rejected many defense allegations of prosecutorial misconduct. The judge, Emmet Sullivan, has not ruled on Flynn’s request to withdraw his guilty plea.

The subject is described as a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser who traveled to Russia in 2015.

Flynn’s attorney Sidney Powell confirmed Thursday that Crossfire Razor was Flynn.

But about two weeks later, according to the documents, case agent Peter Strzok told a colleague not to close the case and to “pls keep it open for now.” In communication with FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who expressed surprise the case was still open, Strzok responded, “Yeah, our utter incompetence actually helps us.”

Strzok and Page have attracted Trump’s derision for exchanging derogatory texts about him during the 2016 campaign. Both have since left the FBI.

By later in the month, the FBI determined they wanted to interview Flynn about conversations he had during the presidential transition period with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in which the men discussed sanctions recently imposed on Russia over election interference.

Agents questioned Flynn at the White House on Jan. 24, 2017, when the FBI says he lied about the Kislyak conversations. He later acknowledged misleading federal agents and, at his sentencing hearing a year later, did not contest the way he was interviewed.

But Flynn’s attorneys point to the newly disclosed documents to suggest the FBI had no basis to question Flynn and had already been prepared to close an investigation into him.

“The revelations of corruption by the FBI to intentionally frame Gen Flynn for crimes the FBI manufactured piles on with each new production of documents,” Powell wrote in a statement.

A federal prosecutor from Missouri is reviewing the Justice Department’s handling of the case at the direction of Attorney General William Barr. The department said the documents were provided as part of that review.

Prosecutors haven’t responded to the defense team’s disclosures, though they have previously denied accusations of misconduct. Sullivan, too, has rejected many of the defense arguments in the past.

Even so, Flynn — who was among the first of the president’s aides charged in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia — has emerged as something of a cause celebre for supporters of the president. They have rallied around the retired Army lieutenant general and seized on the findings of a critical watchdog report on the Russia investigation to try to cast doubt on the entire probe.

Trump has not been shy about using his pardon power to help political allies and those he believes have been wronged by an out-of-control justice system. He has also expressed a desire to intervene in the case of another ally: longtime political adviser Roger Stone.

Other documents released by Flynn’s lawyers include FBI emails and handwritten notes showing officials grappling with how best to approach Flynn, how much information to provide him during the interview and what to do if he made a false statement.

One page of handwritten notes from an FBI official, dated the day of the interview, appears to recap an internal debate about how to proceed.

“What’s our goal? Truth/admission or to get him to lie, so we can prosecute him or get him fired?” the notes say.

The notes also say, “If we’re seen as playing games, WH will be furious. Protect our institution by not playing games.”

Flynn pleaded guilty in December 2017 and went on to provide such extensive cooperation that prosecutors said he was entitled to probation instead of prison.

But his sentencing hearing was abruptly postponed after Flynn, following a stern rebuke from Sullivan that raised the prospect of a prison term, asked to be able to continue cooperating and earn credit toward a more lenient sentence.

“ The investigation was not an investigation of the Trump campaign . It was four investigations of individuals—Carter Page , George Papadopoulos , Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn—associated with the campaign but about whom there was specific reason for concern . In other words , investigators were not spying on the Trump campaign . They had concerns about specific people and their relationship with Russia , just as the FBI has always said… Page has a right to be pissed off . The inspector general has , after all , concluded that serious errors took place in seeking Page ’ s surveillance orders . But that ’ s about as far as it goes . The errors were not political . They were not part of some coup . And in any event , the Page FISA applications did not end up being all that important. ” Benjamin Wittes , Lawfare Blog
Others argue that “ there are important systemic problems with the FBI and the way that the U.S. government approves invasive surveillance techniques on American citizens… the Clinton Foundation investigation began—and this is no joke—with an anti-Hillary book paid for by the former Trump adviser Steve Bannon . If the FBI is making errors in seeking permission to surveil current or former advisers to a presidential campaign , the most politically sensitive kind of investigation , it suggests that there are many more flawed applications to be found in operations where the investigations are not nearly so delicate . The process for seeking permission to spy on American citizens suspected of being foreign agents should be more adversarial than it is , if only to keep the government honest. ” Adam Serwer , The Atlantic
Some posit that “ The conclusion that the predication standard was satisfied comes as no surprise . The standard is low , and deliberately so . While this standard prevents the FBI from opening an investigation on a whim or for an improper personal or political purpose , it allows probes to begin on even the slightest indication of a threat to public safety or national security . A higher standard would handcuff the FBI from completing its mission to protect and defend the American people… “ When predication indicates a threat to public safety or national security , the FBI has a duty to investigate . That duty applies even when the stakes are high , and the target is a powerful person in government . For the FBI to ignore such a threat would be to shirk its responsibilities , and instead leave our nation at risk. ” Barbara McQuade , USA Today

fbi,Politico,0,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/07/25/robert-mueller-hearing-was-awesome-227478,"Actually, Robert Mueller Was Awesome",2019-07-25,"Alexandra Glorioso, Renato Mariotti","Renato Mariotti is the Legal Affairs Columnist for ███ Magazine . He is a former federal prosecutor and host of the “ On Topic ” podcast .
Former special counsel Robert Mueller ’ s testimony Wednesday has been described as “ excruciatingly awkward , ” “ confused , ” “ struggling ” and “ a stammering , stuttering mess . ”
I saw something completely different . From my perspective , after six hours of testimony , it was the 74-year-old career prosecutor and law enforcement officer who won the day . It wasn ’ t that close .
Tasked with overseeing the most high-profile investigation of our time , Mueller managed to complete the investigation without appearing to have a partisan agenda , with both sides embracing him at times . Even Trump said he acted “ honorably ” —before he turned on Mueller as “ conflicted ” and partisan—and touted “ total exoneration ” soon after Mueller concluded his work . Mueller ’ s down-the-middle , leak-free handling of the high-stakes investigation was an object lesson in professionalism .
Mueller didn ’ t want to testify , for good reason . He had done his work already . As a prosecutor , he had to ensure he stayed detached from the political process , presenting his findings in a manner that did not make it appear he was choosing a side or advancing an agenda . One slip of the tongue could be used to undermine his team ’ s work .
In the long view , the verdict of history depends most of all on Mueller being seen as nonpartisan , measured and above the fray—an operator whose work is unimpeachable and can be relied on ( now , or after Trump ’ s term , or years from now ) as a bulletproof statement of fact . So all the little details of the case that members were trying to ferret out pale in comparison to his ability to maintain that status and be seen as a reliable agent of impartiality . During the hearing , that was clearly his goal . In doing that , he succeeded , and history can thank him for it .
It was clear from the start he knew Democrats wanted to use him as a prop to bring the findings of his report to life as part of a push for an impeachment inquiry . Mueller went out of his way to avoid regurgitating the contents of the report , wary of creating sound bites that could be used to suggest he supported impeachment . For instance , when Rep. Veronica Escobar ( D-Texas ) asked him whether his language referring to a constitutional process to “ formally accuse a president of wrongdoing ” was a reference to impeachment , he refused to admit the obvious .
Mueller did that all day long . He refused to answer leading questions whenever answering the question might draw him too close to the political fight , force him to say things that could spur controversy , or cause him to veer outside the four corners of the report . Mueller wanted to go no further than his report and he rarely did so , despite both sides egging him on . He swatted away Republican attempts to elicit answers about the origins of his probe as readily as he ignored Democratic attempts to get him to make their case against Trump .
His monotonal yes and no answers might not have made for the most dramatic viewing , but they weren ’ t without effect . In five minutes , House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff walked Mueller through the most damning details of Volume 1 of his report . Mueller ’ s answers were short— “ that did occur , ” “ accurate , ” “ that is correct ” —but what he affirmed was that Russia engaged in a systematic effort to help Trump win in 2016 , that Trump and his campaign welcomed Russian aid , and that Trump lied to the American people about his business dealings in Russia .
When Mueller wanted to say more , he did . He described in detail the threat posed by the Russian attack on our electoral process , testifying that “ they ’ re doing it as we sit here , and they expect to do it during the next campaign. ” He warned that “ many more countries are developing the capability to replicate what the Russians had done. ” When Mueller had the rare opportunity to testify about matters that were not partisan—matters that should concern all Americans—he testified freely and strongly .
At times , Mueller faced harsh questioning from Republicans who lashed him and his team as biased or worse . His calm demeanor was another sign of his professionalism . It would have been easy for Mueller to fight back—he has in previous appearances , after all—but that would have pulled him into the fray . It was not weakness but rather quiet strength that caused Mueller to do nothing more than calmly reply , “ I take your question , ” in response to GOP Congressman Louie Gohmert ’ s hyperbolic charge that he “ perpetuated injustice . ”
The hesitation you saw in Mueller before he answered questions was the face of a man who was choosing his words carefully . He played it safe , like a football team running out the clock . His constant desire to double-check his report and to refer members of Congress to the report itself was motivated by a desire to ensure that each word of his testimony was accurate . He had no incentive to hurry , knowing it would be hard for members to challenge him in a five-minute time span if he took his time .
Mueller had to be careful and precise because every word he said would be dissected . When he agreed with Rep. Ted Lieu ( D-Calif. ) that the reason he did not “ indict Donald Trump is because of the OLC [ Office of Legal Counsel ] opinion stating you can not indict a sitting president , ” many took that to mean that Mueller had affirmatively concluded that he would have indicted Trump if he could do so . Mueller clarified that point in the afternoon session . It was a rare misstep and he knew he had to fix it without regard to how it might be perceived by either side .
Even Mueller ’ s nonanswers were carefully considered . Mueller refused to answer whether he believes Attorney General William Barr 's letter purporting to summarize his report is accurate . The letter was technically accurate but highly misleading , and an answer from Mueller that the letter was accurate would have left the false impression that the thrust of the letter were true . Mueller also refused to answer whether Trump or his son took the Fifth , presumably because commenting on a defendant ’ s silence can be legally problematic .
Through his careful answers , Mueller was able to thread a needle , staking out very nuanced and careful legal positions without seriously being tested by the members who questioned him . For example , Mueller refused to make any decision as to whether there is sufficient evidence to charge Trump with obstructing justice .
Mueller ’ s decision not to reach a prosecutorial judgment as to obstruction flowed from the DOJ ’ s policy against indicting a sitting president .

Former special counsel Robert Mueller’s testimony Wednesday has been described as “excruciatingly awkward,” “confused,” “struggling” and “a stammering, stuttering mess.”

I saw something completely different. From my perspective, after six hours of testimony, it was the 74-year-old career prosecutor and law enforcement officer who won the day. It wasn’t that close.

Story Continued Below

Tasked with overseeing the most high-profile investigation of our time, Mueller managed to complete the investigation without appearing to have a partisan agenda, with both sides embracing him at times. Even Trump said he acted “honorably”—before he turned on Mueller as “conflicted” and partisan—and touted “total exoneration” soon after Mueller concluded his work. Mueller’s down-the-middle, leak-free handling of the high-stakes investigation was an object lesson in professionalism.

And Wednesday’s performance was no different.

Mueller didn’t want to testify, for good reason. He had done his work already. As a prosecutor, he had to ensure he stayed detached from the political process, presenting his findings in a manner that did not make it appear he was choosing a side or advancing an agenda. One slip of the tongue could be used to undermine his team’s work.

In the long view, the verdict of history depends most of all on Mueller being seen as nonpartisan, measured and above the fray—an operator whose work is unimpeachable and can be relied on (now, or after Trump’s term, or years from now) as a bulletproof statement of fact. So all the little details of the case that members were trying to ferret out pale in comparison to his ability to maintain that status and be seen as a reliable agent of impartiality. During the hearing, that was clearly his goal. In doing that, he succeeded, and history can thank him for it.

It was clear from the start he knew Democrats wanted to use him as a prop to bring the findings of his report to life as part of a push for an impeachment inquiry. Mueller went out of his way to avoid regurgitating the contents of the report, wary of creating sound bites that could be used to suggest he supported impeachment. For instance, when Rep. Veronica Escobar (D-Texas) asked him whether his language referring to a constitutional process to “formally accuse a president of wrongdoing” was a reference to impeachment, he refused to admit the obvious.

Mueller did that all day long. He refused to answer leading questions whenever answering the question might draw him too close to the political fight, force him to say things that could spur controversy, or cause him to veer outside the four corners of the report. Mueller wanted to go no further than his report and he rarely did so, despite both sides egging him on. He swatted away Republican attempts to elicit answers about the origins of his probe as readily as he ignored Democratic attempts to get him to make their case against Trump.

His monotonal yes and no answers might not have made for the most dramatic viewing, but they weren’t without effect. In five minutes, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff walked Mueller through the most damning details of Volume 1 of his report. Mueller’s answers were short—“that did occur,” “accurate,” “that is correct”—but what he affirmed was that Russia engaged in a systematic effort to help Trump win in 2016, that Trump and his campaign welcomed Russian aid, and that Trump lied to the American people about his business dealings in Russia.

When Mueller wanted to say more, he did. He described in detail the threat posed by the Russian attack on our electoral process, testifying that “they’re doing it as we sit here, and they expect to do it during the next campaign.” He warned that “many more countries are developing the capability to replicate what the Russians had done.” When Mueller had the rare opportunity to testify about matters that were not partisan—matters that should concern all Americans—he testified freely and strongly.

At times, Mueller faced harsh questioning from Republicans who lashed him and his team as biased or worse. His calm demeanor was another sign of his professionalism. It would have been easy for Mueller to fight back—he has in previous appearances, after all—but that would have pulled him into the fray. It was not weakness but rather quiet strength that caused Mueller to do nothing more than calmly reply, “I take your question,” in response to GOP Congressman Louie Gohmert’s hyperbolic charge that he “perpetuated injustice.”

The hesitation you saw in Mueller before he answered questions was the face of a man who was choosing his words carefully. He played it safe, like a football team running out the clock. His constant desire to double-check his report and to refer members of Congress to the report itself was motivated by a desire to ensure that each word of his testimony was accurate. He had no incentive to hurry, knowing it would be hard for members to challenge him in a five-minute time span if he took his time.

Mueller had to be careful and precise because every word he said would be dissected. When he agreed with Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) that the reason he did not “indict Donald Trump is because of the OLC [Office of Legal Counsel] opinion stating you cannot indict a sitting president,” many took that to mean that Mueller had affirmatively concluded that he would have indicted Trump if he could do so. Mueller clarified that point in the afternoon session. It was a rare misstep and he knew he had to fix it without regard to how it might be perceived by either side.

Even Mueller’s nonanswers were carefully considered. Mueller refused to answer whether he believes Attorney General William Barr's letter purporting to summarize his report is accurate. The letter was technically accurate but highly misleading, and an answer from Mueller that the letter was accurate would have left the false impression that the thrust of the letter were true. Mueller also refused to answer whether Trump or his son took the Fifth, presumably because commenting on a defendant’s silence can be legally problematic.

Through his careful answers, Mueller was able to thread a needle, staking out very nuanced and careful legal positions without seriously being tested by the members who questioned him. For example, Mueller refused to make any decision as to whether there is sufficient evidence to charge Trump with obstructing justice.

Mueller’s decision not to reach a prosecutorial judgment as to obstruction flowed from the DOJ’s policy against indicting a sitting president. Because Mueller couldn’t indict Trump, he felt it would be unfair to Trump if he reached a conclusion that Trump would be unable to challenge in court. But if Mueller merely reached no conclusion, that could leave the false impression that he found no evidence that Trump committed a crime. So Mueller famously said that he was “unable” to state that Trump “clearly did not commit obstruction of justice,” and thus his report “does not exonerate” Trump. This may sound confusing to a layperson, but it is a very careful approach that permitted Mueller to be as fair as possible to Trump under the circumstances.

No one had ever publicly asked Mueller about this very nuanced but unprecedented approach. Many argue that Mueller should have stated his conclusion, and in any event, it’s unclear why he chose the “does not exonerate” language instead of merely making clear that his nondecision does not mean there is not enough evidence to charge Trump.

But both sides failed to meaningfully probe Mueller’s reasoning on this key issue. Republicans criticized and grilled him as to “exoneration,” but they had to be careful not to give Mueller an opportunity to refer to the DOJ policy against indicting a sitting president. Lurking in the background was the reality that Mueller found “substantial” evidence to prove each of the elements of obstruction of justice. Pushing him to explain himself would be bad for Trump. Yet Democrats could not get him to do so either because they were in no position to push him to do something he was unwilling to do.

So Mueller got to say what he wanted to say, which is that there is “substantial” evidence to support counts of obstruction, without being forced to say that he concluded Trump obstructed justice. Despite hours of questioning by dozens of members of Congress, Mueller was never backed into a corner or forced to explain the most important legal decision he made.

Even if some think Mueller has lost a step since he last appeared before Congress six years ago, he still looked a step or two ahead of most of his questioners on Wednesday. Most importantly, he appeared above the fray, cautious, and fair in the face of bitter partisan rancor. That is what we should expect from prosecutors, and it is the legacy that Mueller leaves behind.

Former Vice President Joe Biden is on a list of names provided to Senate Republicans by a sympathetic spy boss in connection with the case of former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

That was the latest twist in a years-long saga that changed course again this week following action by acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell, who declassified the names of a number of people who requested intelligence information in the final days of the Obama administration.

A number of former officials, including Biden, are on the list and are described as having potentially received intelligence reporting connected to Flynn. A message from the National Security Agency included with Grenell's note to the Republicans says it isn't clear who may actually have viewed it.

You can see the list and notes here.

Nonetheless, President Trump and his supporters have sought political revenge with the release of the material years after what they perceive as a pernicious attack by the expiring Obama team.

Biden's campaign slammed what it called a political stunt that it said was an attempt by the White House to distract Americans from the coronavirus pandemic.

The Russia imbroglio

The melodrama began years ago, when a White House official in the final days of the Obama era revealed to The Washington Post that Flynn had spoken with Russia's then-ambassador to the United States during the presidential transition period.

That kernel of news snowballed into a scandal that led to Flynn's ouster and a guilty plea for lying to the FBI. All along, Flynn's allies have slammed Obama-era officials for leaking his identity in a political attack, calling that an abuse of power.

Meanwhile, Flynn's case never was resolved, and he has been battling back against federal authorities, helped politically by revelations about problems with the Russia investigation and by allies eager to rehabilitate him and strike at the Obama team.

This month, as the Justice Department said it was moving to drop its case against Flynn, Grenell was working behind the scenes to identify and then reveal the Obama-era officials who might have had access to the information about Flynn's phone conversation.

Biden, the likely Democratic Party nominee for president this year, was just one of a number of top Obama lieutenants on the list provided by Grenell. Also present were then-Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, then-FBI Director James Comey, then-CIA Director John Brennan and others.

Grenell provided the list to Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who unveiled it on Wednesday. The senators demanded explanations from Biden and the others.

""The officials listed should confirm whether they reviewed this information, why they asked for it and what they did with it, and answer many other questions that have been raised by recent revelations,"" Grassley and Johnson said in a statement. ""We are making this public because the American people have a right to know what happened.""

Revealing classified information is against the law, and the identification of the names on Wednesday could set the stage, at least in theory, for the prosecution of whoever was connected definitively with talking to The Post.

Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Biden's campaign, slammed what he called an attempt by the Trump administration to change the subject in Washington from the coronavirus disaster.

""These documents simply indicate the breadth and depth of concern across the American government — including among career officials — over intelligence reports of Michael Flynn's attempts to undermine ongoing American national security policy through discussions with Russian officials or other foreign representatives.""

Unmasking

The U.S. intelligence community produces a flood of reporting about myriad targets and issues around the world. In much of what it yields, the identities of ""U.S. persons"" are ""minimized"": Rather than saying ""Foreign Agent X communicated with John Smith,"" a report might say, ""X communicated with U.S. Person 1.""

Government officials of sufficient stature can request that ""Person 1,"" in this example, be ""unmasked"" to learn more about the report.

""Importantly, none of these individuals could have known Flynn's identity beforehand,"" Bates said. ""These documents have absolutely nothing to do with any FBI investigation, and they confirm that all normal procedures were followed — any suggestion otherwise is a flat-out lie.""

The conversation

In late 2016 and early 2017, Flynn and the Trump transition team began making contacts with foreign diplomats, many of whom likely were ongoing surveillance targets. That means ""U.S. Persons"" connected with the new administration also likely began cropping up in the reporting about their conversations.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on Wednesday that he wants more information about who else from the Trump camp besides Flynn might have been in those reports.

On Dec. 29, 2016, Flynn spoke on the phone with Russia's then-ambassador to the United States and asked him to ask his government not to retaliate against punitive measures then being imposed on Moscow by the outgoing Obama administration.

Russian President Vladimir Putin later announced he wouldn't retaliate.

The ambassador's communications were being monitored, and U.S. officials learned about the contents of that conversation with Flynn. But when Flynn and the White House later talked publicly about what was said, the two stories didn't match.

The backdrop for all this was a fun-house mirror political environment in Washington at a time when many Americans were reeling from the revelations about Russia's interference in the recent election.

Trump, meanwhile, was denying there had been any interference, claiming that his campaign had no contact with those involved and that he had no business dealings with Russia.

Those claims all eventually would be exploded, although investigators never made any conspiracy charges against anyone in Trump's camp for cooperating with the Russians who interfered in the election.

In early 2017, the FBI had been investigating whether anyone in Trump's camp — including Flynn — might have been coordinating with the Russians who were attacking the election.

Flynn had traveled to Russia for a dinner with Putin and took tens of thousands of dollars' worth of payments from Russian entities. Obama warned Trump personally about Flynn.

Subsequent evidence has suggested that in early 2017, investigators may have been ready to close the file on Flynn. Then came the flap over the sanctions conversation; special agents went to interview him about it.

Flynn lied to them about the discussions and later accepted a deal in which he agreed to plead guilty in exchange for a comparatively lenient prosecution and cooperating with investigators, which he did until a change of tune last year.

The White House responded by saying the memo “ raises serious concerns about the integrity of decisions made at the highest levels of the Department of Justice and the FBI to use the government ’ s most intrusive surveillance tools against American citizens . ”

The memo states that in December 2017 , then FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe testified that “ no surveillance warrant would have been sought ” from the FISA court “ without the Steele dossier information . ”

For what ? DOJ & FBI must keep doing their jobs . ”

Trump ’ s current Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein also signed at least one FISA application for Page – along with former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates and former Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente .
Page ’ s FISA application “ cited extensively ” a September 23 , 2016 Yahoo News article , which focused on Page ’ s trip to Moscow . The memo read that the “ article does not corroborate the Steele dossier because it is derived from information leaked by Steele himself to Yahoo News . ”
In a statement to Fox News , Page said the memo reveals an `` unprecedented abuse of process . ”

The release of the four-page memo comes after the Intelligence Committee voted earlier this week , over Democratic objections , to make the document public .
This led to a rare and stunning rebuke from the bureau , which said Wednesday they had “ grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo ’ s accuracy . ”
In a last-ditch objection , the top Democrat on the House committee claimed overnight that Nunes had made “ material changes ” to the memo that was sent to the White House for review .

The White House had backed the memo ’ s release , calling for “ transparency . ”
Just more than two weeks , Republican lawmakers first drew attention to the memo , with some calling it “ shocking , ” “ troubling ” and “ alarming ” and one likening the details to KGB activity in Russia . They argued the memo should be immediately made public , leading to a social media # ReleaseTheMemo campaign .
California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff , the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee , indicated Friday that he believes the panel will now publish a counter-memo authored by Democrats . Sarah Sanders , the White House press secretary , suggested Friday the president will not oppose that effort .
“ The administration stands ready to work with Congress to accommodate oversight requests consistent with applicable standards , including the need to protect intelligence sources and methods , ” Sanders said of the Democratic memo .","A much-hyped memo that shows alleged government surveillance abuse during the 2016 campaign has been released to the public and cites testimony from a high-ranking government official who says the FBI and DOJ would not have sought surveillance warrants to spy on a member of the Trump team without the infamous, Democrat-funded anti-Trump dossier.

Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee released the memo Friday. The White House responded by saying the memo “raises serious concerns about the integrity of decisions made at the highest levels of the Department of Justice and the FBI to use the government’s most intrusive surveillance tools against American citizens.”

READ THE FISA MEMO

The dossier, authored by former British spy Christopher Steele and commissioned by Fusion GPS, was paid for by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign through law firm Perkins Coie. It included salacious and unverified allegations about Trump's connections to Russia.

The memo, which has been at the center of an intense power struggle between congressional Republicans and the FBI, specifically cites the DOJ and FBI’s surveillance of Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, saying the dossier ""formed an essential part"" of the application to spy on him.

Dennis Johnson fell victim last week to a new form of harassment known as ""Zoombombing,"" in which intruders hijack video calls and post hate speech and offensive images such as pornography. It's a phenomenon so alarming that the FBI has issued a warning about using Zoom.

Like many people these days, Johnson is doing a lot of things over the Internet that he would normally do in person. Last week, he defended his doctoral dissertation in a Zoom videoconference.

He had a big audience — he estimated it was about 40 people, including ""my closest friends, family and my classmates and my dissertation committee"" at California State University, Long Beach, he said.

Johnson is the first member of his family to graduate from college, let alone get a doctorate. He wanted to share the moment with them.

He said he was in the middle of presenting when someone started drawing male genitalia on the screen. At first, Johnson said, he was not sure what was happening.

""I'm like, 'Whoa!' And then I freeze, and everyone who's watching the screen freezes,"" he said.

It got worse. The attacker scrawled a racial slur that everyone on the Zoom call could see.

Johnson was horrified. The organizers blocked everyone's screen until they could remove the intruder from the meeting. But, Johnson said, they were not able to identify that person.

Although he was shaken, Johnson managed to finish his presentation. But what should have been a triumphant celebration was ruined.

""The moment they [told] me, 'Congratulations, Dr. Dennis Johnson,' and it's all over and I leave the Zoom meeting, everything sets in,"" he said. ""I couldn't even, like, communicate. I had to just walk out [of] my house. ... I didn't want to talk or see anybody.""

Zoombombers have disrupted an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in New York, Sunday school in Texas, online classes at the University of Southern California and a city meeting in Kalamazoo, Mich.

With schools closed and millions of people working from home, Zoom has become wildly popular. The company said 200 million people used the app on a daily basis in March, up from just 10 million in December. But that newfound popularity is bringing new scrutiny.

The FBI is warning schools, in particular, to be careful.

""The FBI has received multiple reports of conferences being disrupted by pornographic and/or hate images and threatening language,"" the bureau's Boston office said this week.

As concerns have arisen, Zoom has worked to address them. It published a guide last month on how users can protect meetings. It also changed settings for accounts used by schools and universities to make their meetings more private by default.

New York Attorney General Letitia James has sent a letter to Zoom asking about its security and privacy protections.

""Things you just would like to have in a chat and video application — strong encryption, strong privacy controls, strong security — just seem to be completely missing,"" said Patrick Wardle, a security researcher who previously worked at the National Security Agency.

He and other researchers have turned up flaws in Zoom's software that could let hackers spy through a computer's webcam or microphone. Zoom says it released fixes for these issues on Wednesday.

Wardle says Zoom may be easy to use, but he is wary of its track record.

But that assessment was watered down in remarks prepared last year for then-FBI Director James Comey . It was replaced with softer language stating that it was “ possible ” that hostile actors had gained access to Clinton ’ s server , which contained thousands of classified documents .
The edit was revealed on Thursday in a letter sent by Senate Homeland Security Committee chairman Ron Johnson to FBI Director Christopher Wray .
The change is one of several made in May 2016 to Comey ’ s so-called exoneration statement in the Clinton case .
“ The edits to Director Comey ’ s public statement , made months prior to the conclusion of the FBI ’ s investigation of Secretary Clinton ’ s conduct , had a significant impact on the FBI ’ s public evaluation of the implications of her actions , ” Johnson wrote to Wray .
He noted the recent revelations about Peter Strzok , the FBI agent who was a central figure in both the Clinton email probe and Trump investigations . Strzok was discovered to have sent anti-Trump and pro-Clinton text messages to FBI lawyer Lisa Page while he was overseeing both investigations .
Strzok conducted the most important interviews in the Clinton investigation . He interviewed Clinton herself on July 2 , 2016 and also met with the Democrat ’ s top aides , Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills .
Strzok is also believed to have softened some of the language in Comey ’ s statement . CNN has reported that he removed the legalistic term “ grossly negligent ” and replaced it with “ extremely careless. ” Gross negligence in the handling of classified material is a crime .
The edits to Comey ’ s statement “ raise profound questions about the FBI ’ s role and possible interference in the 2016 presidential election and the role of the same agents in Special Counsel Robert Mueller ’ s investigation of President Trump , ” Johnson wrote to Wray .
The edits were made after Comey sent a draft of his remarks on May 2 , 2016 to Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe , general counsel James Baker and chief of staff James Rybicki .
On May 16 , 2016 , McCabe sent the draft to Strzok and several other counterintelligence agents asking for edits .
In addition to softening the language regarding intrusion of Clinton ’ s server by foreign actors , Comey ’ s draft was edited to remove language that suggested that she and her aides broke the law .
The rough draft stated that the private server violated “ the statute proscribing gross negligence in the handling of classified information ” as well as of the statute regarding “ misdemeanor mishandling ” of classified information .
Comey ’ s public statement made no mention of gross negligence or misdemeanor mishandling . The final copy stated that “ although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information , my judgement is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case . ”
Clinton ’ s opponents have long speculated that her email server was hacked . Though there was no public evidence that the device was ever breached , Republicans said that Clinton ’ s carelessness ensured that it was . That possibility made it all the more troubling that Clinton flouted federal regulations to operate a private server , they argued .
In the pre-edited statement , Comey said that “ we assess it is reasonably likely that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton ’ s private email account . ”
“ Given that combination of factors , we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton ’ s personal e-mail account , ” he said .

fbi,USA TODAY,1,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/12/01/former-national-security-adviser-mike-flynn-charged-lying-fbi/912750001/,Former national security adviser Mike Flynn charged with lying to FBI,2017-12-01,,"WASHINGTON — Former national security adviser Michael Flynn brought the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election to President Trump 's inner circle on Friday , promising to give prosecutors information about other senior aides as he pleaded guilty to a charge of lying to the FBI .
Flynn ’ s abrupt guilty plea is the dramatic culmination of an investigation Trump had once asked the FBI to drop . His cooperation means a top adviser in the campaign and the early days of his presidency is now providing evidence in an investigation that has cast a shadow over the president 's first year in office . And it suggests that the investigation remains far from over .
Flynn is the fourth former Trump aide to face criminal charges in special counsel Robert Mueller ’ s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election , but the first to be prosecuted for things that happened during the Trump administration and the first to so directly bring the special counsel 's case to the administration 's door .
In court Friday morning , prosecutors prosecutors offered their first hint of the information Flynn might provide , saying that conversations he had with Russia 's U.S. ambassador had been coordinated by a `` senior official of the presidential transition . ''
In a court filing made public Friday , prosecutors alleged that Flynn “ did willfully and knowingly make materially false , fictitious and fraudulent statements ” to FBI agents during an interview on Jan. 24 -- four days after he began serving in the White House -- about his conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the weeks before Trump took office . Prosecutors charged that he falsely told FBI agents that he did not ask Kislyak to delay a vote on a pending United Nations Security Council resolution critical of Israeli settlements .
That call , prosecutors said , was made at the direction of a `` very senior member of the Presidential Transition Team . '' Prosecutors did not identify the official ; the Associated Press and NBC News reported that it was Trump 's son-in-law Jared Kushner , citing unnamed officials . Kushner 's lawyer could not be reached to comment on Friday .

Prosecutors also charged that Flynn lied to agents about a Dec. 29 conversation about how Russia might respond to sanctions the U.S. government had levied over its election meddling . President Obama imposed those sanctions Dec. 28 ; the same day , Kislyak contacted Flynn to discuss how the Russian government would respond .
The next day , Flynn called a `` senior official of the Presidential Transition Team '' at Trump 's private Mar-a-Lago resort `` to discuss what , if anything , to communicate to the Russian Ambassador about the U.S. sanctions , '' according to a court filing signed by Flynn and prosecutors . Immediately after that call , Flynn called Kislyak and asked that Russia `` not escalate the situation . ''
Russian President Vladimir Putin said the following day that his government would not retaliate for the sanctions . Trump praised Putin 's move on Twitter , writing `` I always knew he was very smart ! ''
While incoming presidents traditionally have calls with world leaders during the transition , it is unusual for his aides to begin conducting foreign policy of any kind before the inauguration .
After pleading guilty , Flynn issued a personal statement that said , `` I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong , and , through my faith in God , I am working to set things right . My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel 's Office reflect a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country . ''

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — Former national security adviser Michael Flynn brought the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election to President Trump's inner circle on Friday, promising to give prosecutors information about other senior aides as he pleaded guilty to a charge of lying to the FBI.

Flynn’s abrupt guilty plea is the dramatic culmination of an investigation Trump had once asked the FBI to drop. His cooperation means a top adviser in the campaign and the early days of his presidency is now providing evidence in an investigation that has cast a shadow over the president's first year in office. And it suggests that the investigation remains far from over.

Flynn is the fourth former Trump aide to face criminal charges in special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, but the first to be prosecuted for things that happened during the Trump administration and the first to so directly bring the special counsel's case to the administration's door.

In court Friday morning, prosecutors prosecutors offered their first hint of the information Flynn might provide, saying that conversations he had with Russia's U.S. ambassador had been coordinated by a ""senior official of the presidential transition.""

In a court filing made public Friday, prosecutors alleged that Flynn “did willfully and knowingly make materially false, fictitious and fraudulent statements” to FBI agents during an interview on Jan. 24 -- four days after he began serving in the White House -- about his conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the weeks before Trump took office. Prosecutors charged that he falsely told FBI agents that he did not ask Kislyak to delay a vote on a pending United Nations Security Council resolution critical of Israeli settlements.

That call, prosecutors said, was made at the direction of a ""very senior member of the Presidential Transition Team."" Prosecutors did not identify the official; the Associated Press and NBC News reported that it was Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, citing unnamed officials. Kushner's lawyer could not be reached to comment on Friday.

Prosecutors also charged that Flynn lied to agents about a Dec. 29 conversation about how Russia might respond to sanctions the U.S. government had levied over its election meddling. President Obama imposed those sanctions Dec. 28; the same day, Kislyak contacted Flynn to discuss how the Russian government would respond.

The next day, Flynn called a ""senior official of the Presidential Transition Team"" at Trump's private Mar-a-Lago resort ""to discuss what, if anything, to communicate to the Russian Ambassador about the U.S. sanctions,"" according to a court filing signed by Flynn and prosecutors. Immediately after that call, Flynn called Kislyak and asked that Russia ""not escalate the situation.""

Russian President Vladimir Putin said the following day that his government would not retaliate for the sanctions. Trump praised Putin's move on Twitter, writing ""I always knew he was very smart!""

While incoming presidents traditionally have calls with world leaders during the transition, it is unusual for his aides to begin conducting foreign policy of any kind before the inauguration.

After pleading guilty, Flynn issued a personal statement that said, ""I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and, through my faith in God, I am working to set things right. My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel's Office reflect a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country.""

""“Mr. Flynn, how do you plead to count one of the information?"" Contreras asked.

“Guilty, your honor,"" Flynn replied.

After the judge accepted his plea, Flynn returned to the defendant’s table, put on a pair of reading glasses and signed some paperwork before being escorted out of the courthouse by U.S. Marshals. He was released without bail.

In a written plea agreement, prosecutors said Flynn likely faces up to six months in prison under federal sentencing rules, and potentially less if investigators are satisfied with the extent of his cooperation. He will not be sentenced until he is finished cooperating.

Trump fired Flynn in February after misleading Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russian officials.

The racketeering scheme was conducted “ with the consent of higher level officials ” in Russia who “ shared the proceeds ” from the kickbacks , one agent declared in an affidavit years later .
Rather than bring immediate charges in 2010 , however , the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years , essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefiting Putin ’ s commercial nuclear ambitions .
The first decision occurred in October 2010 , when the State Department and government agencies on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States unanimously approved the partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to the Russian nuclear giant Rosatom , giving Moscow control of more than 20 percent of America ’ s uranium supply .
When this sale was used by Trump on the campaign trail last year , Hillary Clinton ’ s spokesman said she was not involved in the committee review and noted the State Department official who handled it said she “ never intervened ... on any [ Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ] matter . ”
In 2011 , the administration gave approval for Rosatom ’ s Tenex subsidiary to sell commercial uranium to U.S. nuclear power plants in a partnership with the United States Enrichment Corp. Before then , Tenex had been limited to selling U.S. nuclear power plants reprocessed uranium recovered from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons under the 1990s Megatons to Megawatts peace program .
“ The Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats , all of which raised legitimate national security concerns . And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions , ” a person who worked on the case told ███ , speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials .
The Obama administration ’ s decision to approve Rosatom ’ s purchase of Uranium One has been a source of political controversy since 2015 .
That ’ s when conservative author Peter Schweitzer and The New York Times documented how Bill Clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees and his charitable foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the deal while Hillary Clinton presided on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States .
The Obama administration and the Clintons defended their actions at the time , insisting there was no evidence that any Russians or donors engaged in wrongdoing and there was no national security reason for any member of the committee to oppose the Uranium One deal .
But FBI , Energy Department and court documents reviewed by ███ show the FBI in fact had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee ’ s decision that Vadim Mikerin — the main Russian overseeing Putin ’ s nuclear expansion inside the United States — was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009 .

Multiple current and former government officials told ███ they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered .
Spokesmen for Holder and Clinton did not return calls seeking comment . The Justice Department also didn ’ t comment .
Mikerin was a director of Rosatom ’ s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s , where he oversaw Rosatom ’ s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries . In 2010 , Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom ’ s new American arm called Tenam .
Between 2009 and January 2012 , Mikerin “ did knowingly and willfully combine , conspire confederate and agree with other persons … to obstruct , delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity ( enriched uranium ) in commerce by extortion , ” a November 2014 indictment stated .
His illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness , an American businessman , who began making kickback payments at Mikerin ’ s direction and with the permission of the FBI . The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27 , 2009 , the records show .
In evidentiary affidavits signed in 2014 and 2015 , an Energy Department agent assigned to assist the FBI in the case testified that Mikerin supervised a “ racketeering scheme ” that involved extortion , bribery , money laundering and kickbacks that were both directed by and provided benefit to more senior officials back in Russia .
“ As part of the scheme , Mikerin , with the consent of higher level officials at TENEX and Rosatom ( both Russian state-owned entities ) would offer no-bid contracts to US businesses in exchange for kickbacks in the form of money payments made to some offshore banks accounts , ” Agent David Gadren testified .
“ Mikerin apparently then shared the proceeds with other co-conspirators associated with TENEX in Russia and elsewhere , ” the agent added .

Both men now play a key role in the current investigation into possible , but still unproven , collusion between Russia and Donald Trump ’ s campaign during the 2016 election cycle . McCabe is under congressional and Justice Department inspector general investigation in connection with money his wife ’ s Virginia state Senate campaign accepted in 2015 from now-Virginia Gov . Terry McAuliffe at a time when McAuliffe was reportedly under investigation by the FBI . The probe is not focused on McAuliffe 's conduct but rather on whether McCabe 's attendance violated the Hatch Act or other FBI conflict rules .
Its many twist and turns aside , the FBI nuclear industry case proved a gold mine , in part because it uncovered a new Russian money laundering apparatus that routed bribe and kickback payments through financial instruments in Cyprus , Latvia and Seychelles . A Russian financier in New Jersey was among those arrested for the money laundering , court records show .
The case also exposed a serious national security breach : Mikerin had given a contract to an American trucking firm called Transport Logistics International that held the sensitive job of transporting Russia ’ s uranium around the United States in return for more than $ 2 million in kickbacks from some of its executives , court records show .
One of Mikerin ’ s former employees told the FBI that Tenex officials in Russia specifically directed the scheme to “ allow for padded pricing to include kickbacks , ” agents testified in one court filing .
Bringing down a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme that had both compromised a sensitive uranium transportation asset inside the U.S. and facilitated international money laundering would seem a major feather in any law enforcement agency ’ s cap .
But the Justice Department and FBI took little credit in 2014 when Mikerin , the Russian financier and the trucking firm executives were arrested and charged .
The only public statement occurred a year later when the Justice Department put out a little-noticed press release in August 2015 , just days before Labor Day . The release noted that the various defendants had reached plea deals .
By that time , the criminal cases against Mikerin had been narrowed to a single charge of money laundering for a scheme that officials admitted stretched from 2004 to 2014 . And though agents had evidence of criminal wrongdoing they collected since at least 2009 , federal prosecutors only cited in the plea agreement a handful of transactions that occurred in 2011 and 2012 , well after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ’ s approval .
The final court case also made no mention of any connection to the influence peddling conversations the FBI undercover informant witnessed about the Russian nuclear officials trying to ingratiate themselves with the Clintons even though agents had gathered documents showing the transmission of millions of dollars from Russia ’ s nuclear industry to an American entity that had provided assistance to Bill Clinton ’ s foundation , sources confirmed to ███ .
The lack of fanfare left many key players in Washington with no inkling that a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme with serious national security implications had been uncovered .
On Dec. 15 , 2015 , the Justice Department put out a release stating that Mikerin , “ a former Russian official residing in Maryland was sentenced today to 48 months in prison ” and ordered to forfeit more than $ 2.1 million .
Ronald Hosko , who served as the assistant FBI director in charge of criminal cases when the investigation was underway , told ███ he did not recall ever being briefed about Mikerin ’ s case by the counterintelligence side of the bureau despite the criminal charges that were being lodged .
“ I had no idea this case was being conducted , ” a surprised Hosko said in an interview .
Likewise , major congressional figures were also kept in the dark .

Before then, Tenex had been limited to selling U.S. nuclear power plants reprocessed uranium recovered from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons under the 1990s Megatons to Megawatts peace program.

“The Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns. And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,” a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.

The Obama administration’s decision to approve Rosatom’s purchase of Uranium One has been a source of political controversy since 2015.

That’s when conservative author Peter Schweitzer and The New York Times documented how Bill Clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees and his charitable foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the deal while Hillary Clinton presided on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.

The Obama administration and the Clintons defended their actions at the time, insisting there was no evidence that any Russians or donors engaged in wrongdoing and there was no national security reason for any member of the committee to oppose the Uranium One deal.

But FBI, Energy Department and court documents reviewed by The Hill show the FBI in fact had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee’s decision that Vadim Mikerin — the main Russian overseeing Putin’s nuclear expansion inside the United States — was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009.

Then-Attorney General Eric Holder Eric Himpton HolderParties to wage census battle with outside groups Welcome to third-world democracy and impeachment Uber settles sexual harassment charges for .4 million MORE was among the Obama administration officials joining Hillary Clinton on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States at the time the Uranium One deal was approved. Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.

Spokesmen for Holder and Clinton did not return calls seeking comment. The Justice Department also didn’t comment.

Mikerin was a director of Rosatom’s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw Rosatom’s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries. In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom’s new American arm called Tenam.

Between 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin “did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons … to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,” a November 2014 indictment stated.

His illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin’s direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show.

In evidentiary affidavits signed in 2014 and 2015, an Energy Department agent assigned to assist the FBI in the case testified that Mikerin supervised a “racketeering scheme” that involved extortion, bribery, money laundering and kickbacks that were both directed by and provided benefit to more senior officials back in Russia.

“As part of the scheme, Mikerin, with the consent of higher level officials at TENEX and Rosatom (both Russian state-owned entities) would offer no-bid contracts to US businesses in exchange for kickbacks in the form of money payments made to some offshore banks accounts,” Agent David Gadren testified.

“Mikerin apparently then shared the proceeds with other co-conspirators associated with TENEX in Russia and elsewhere,” the agent added.

The investigation was ultimately supervised by then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein Rod RosensteinJournalist alleging Obama administration spied on her seeks to reopen case Rosenstein on his time in Trump administration: 'We got all the big issues right' Rod Rosenstein joins law and lobbying firm MORE, an Obama appointee who now serves as President Trump Donald John TrumpDem lawmaker says Nunes threatened to sue him over criticism Parnas: U.S. ambassador to Ukraine removed to clear path for investigations into Bidens Five takeaways from Parnas's Maddow interview MORE’s deputy attorney general, and then-Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe Andrew George McCabeMcCabe accuses Trump officials of withholding evidence in lawsuit over firing McCabe: Being accused of treason by Trump 'quite honestly terrifying' Horowitz report is damning for the FBI and unsettling for the rest of us MORE, now the deputy FBI director under Trump, Justice Department documents show.

Both men now play a key role in the current investigation into possible, but still unproven, collusion between Russia and Donald Trump’s campaign during the 2016 election cycle. McCabe is under congressional and Justice Department inspector general investigation in connection with money his wife’s Virginia state Senate campaign accepted in 2015 from now-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe at a time when McAuliffe was reportedly under investigation by the FBI. The probe is not focused on McAuliffe's conduct but rather on whether McCabe's attendance violated the Hatch Act or other FBI conflict rules.

Its many twist and turns aside, the FBI nuclear industry case proved a gold mine, in part because it uncovered a new Russian money laundering apparatus that routed bribe and kickback payments through financial instruments in Cyprus, Latvia and Seychelles. A Russian financier in New Jersey was among those arrested for the money laundering, court records show.

The case also exposed a serious national security breach: Mikerin had given a contract to an American trucking firm called Transport Logistics International that held the sensitive job of transporting Russia’s uranium around the United States in return for more than $2 million in kickbacks from some of its executives, court records show.

One of Mikerin’s former employees told the FBI that Tenex officials in Russia specifically directed the scheme to “allow for padded pricing to include kickbacks,” agents testified in one court filing.

Bringing down a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme that had both compromised a sensitive uranium transportation asset inside the U.S. and facilitated international money laundering would seem a major feather in any law enforcement agency’s cap.

But the Justice Department and FBI took little credit in 2014 when Mikerin, the Russian financier and the trucking firm executives were arrested and charged.

The only public statement occurred a year later when the Justice Department put out a little-noticed press release in August 2015, just days before Labor Day. The release noted that the various defendants had reached plea deals.

By that time, the criminal cases against Mikerin had been narrowed to a single charge of money laundering for a scheme that officials admitted stretched from 2004 to 2014. And though agents had evidence of criminal wrongdoing they collected since at least 2009, federal prosecutors only cited in the plea agreement a handful of transactions that occurred in 2011 and 2012, well after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States’s approval.

The final court case also made no mention of any connection to the influence peddling conversations the FBI undercover informant witnessed about the Russian nuclear officials trying to ingratiate themselves with the Clintons even though agents had gathered documents showing the transmission of millions of dollars from Russia’s nuclear industry to an American entity that had provided assistance to Bill Clinton’s foundation, sources confirmed to The Hill.

The lack of fanfare left many key players in Washington with no inkling that a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme with serious national security implications had been uncovered.

On Dec. 15, 2015, the Justice Department put out a release stating that Mikerin, “a former Russian official residing in Maryland was sentenced today to 48 months in prison” and ordered to forfeit more than $2.1 million.

Ronald Hosko, who served as the assistant FBI director in charge of criminal cases when the investigation was underway, told The Hill he did not recall ever being briefed about Mikerin’s case by the counterintelligence side of the bureau despite the criminal charges that were being lodged.

“I had no idea this case was being conducted,” a surprised Hosko said in an interview.

Likewise, major congressional figures were also kept in the dark.

Former Rep. Mike Rogers Michael (Mike) Dennis RogersHouse Homeland Security rip DHS's 'unacceptable' failure to comply with subpoena House passes defense bill to establish Space Force, paid family leave for federal workers Hillicon Valley: FCC moves against Huawei, ZTE | Dem groups ask Google to reconsider ads policy | Bill introduced to increase data access during probes MORE (R-Mich.), who chaired the House Intelligence Committee during the time the FBI probe was being conducted, told The Hill that he had never been told anything about the Russian nuclear corruption case even though many fellow lawmakers had serious concerns about the Obama administration’s approval of the Uranium One deal.

“Not providing information on a corruption scheme before the Russian uranium deal was approved by U.S. regulators and engage appropriate congressional committees has served to undermine U.S. national security interests by the very people charged with protecting them,” he said. “The Russian efforts to manipulate our American political enterprise is breathtaking.”

USA TODAY

Peter Strzok, the FBI agent who exchanged anti-Trump text messages with his co-worker girlfriend, was fired, his lawyer said Monday.

Strzok is the third high-profile FBI official to be fired from the bureau since President Donald Trump took office. Last year, Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. This year, FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was fired by Attorney General Jeff Sessions days before he was set to retire and his benefits would have set in.

Strzok, who worked for the bureau for 22 years, helped lead the investigations into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election and into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.

Last summer, Strzok was removed from the Russia inquiry by special counsel Robert Mueller when Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz discovered texts between Strzok and FBI attorney Lisa Page disparaging presidential candidate Trump in 2016.

Trump has often pointed to Strzok and Page's text messages to attack the special counsel's Russia inquiry, which he contends is a ""witch hunt"" biased against him.

Monday, Trump welcomed Strzok's firing and suggested the Mueller inquiry should be dropped.

""Based on the fact that Strzok was in charge of the Witch Hunt, will it be dropped? It is a total Hoax. No Collusion, No Obstruction - I just fight back!"" the president wrote on Twitter.

When Strzok testified during a heated hearing with lawmakers last month, he insisted that his personal opinions of Trump hadn't affected his work.

""Let me be clear, unequivocally and under oath: Not once in my 26 years of defending our nation did my personal opinions impact any official action I took,"" Strzok told two House committees.

""This is true for the Clinton email investigation, for the investigation into Russian interference and for every other investigation I’ve worked on,"" Strzok said in a chamber packed with a standing-room-only crowd. ""It is not who I am, and it is not something I would ever do. Period.""

In a statement, Strzok attorney Aitan Goelman said the FBI deputy director overruled the bureau's Office of Professional Responsibility and ""departed from established precedent"" by firing Strzok on Friday.

""This decision should be deeply troubling to all Americans,"" Goelman said. ""A lengthy investigation and multiple rounds of congressional testimony failed to produce a shred of evidence that Special Agent Strzok’s personal views ever affected his work.""

The FBI maintained that the decision was the product of the ""standard FBI review and disciplinary process"" after Strzok's conduct was highlighted in the report from the Justice Department's inspector general. That report was referred to the FBI’s Office of Professional Responsibility.

""OPR reviewed the investigative materials, as well as the written and oral responses of Mr. Strzok and his counsel, and issued OPR's decision,"" the bureau said in a statement. ""The deputy director, as the senior career FBI official, has the delegated authority to review and modify any disciplinary findings and or penalty as deemed necessary in the best interest of the FBI.""

The woman one third of America thinks is probably a murderer just wasn ’ t going to waltz her way into the White House , even against Donald Trump . And now , after what FBI director James Comey did Friday , we know that Hillary Clinton is going to have to dig down deeper than she ever has and fight like she never has .
She ’ s been there before—in February 1992 , when a bombshell revelation about Bill Clinton and the Vietnam-era draft looked like it was going to finish him off . But that was as the candidate ’ s spouse , not the candidate . We ’ ll circle back to that story , because it has application to this moment .
But first : where does this stand as of Saturday morning . Here ’ s what we know :
1 . How Comey could release such a letter without even having read the emails is astounding . You ’ ve read by now or at least seen reference to former Justice Department spokesman Matthew Miller ’ s Friday afternoon tweetstorm savaging Comey for violating department protocols by doing something like this so close to an election ( 60 days out is the usual limit , Miller said ) . This new information , as Miller noted , might not even involve Clinton . Or it might involve her but be completely benign—some email exchanges with Huma Abedin that has nothing whatever to do with classified information . Comey ’ s a Republican , of course , and Republicans and conservatives have hammered him every day since he announced no indictment of Clinton back in July . Looks like it worked , even if the move was made to protect himself and his career .
2 . Even if you think it was defensible for Comey to do this 11 days before an election , it ’ s virtually impossible to think that the way he did it was responsible . His letter was vague as to be open to all kinds of dire interpretations , and it ’ s hard to imagine that wasn ’ t intentional . The actual , real-life summary of what happened yesterday is : FBI is investigating Anthony Weiner , and there may or may not be some emails on his laptop that have to do with Clinton , and we have no idea how many or what they said . But the wording of Comey ’ s letter allowed Republicans to exclaim that the FBI had “ reopened ” its investigation into Clinton , which so far overstates what has happened here . Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah and others tweeted that right after they got the letter via email , and it set the tone of the hyperventilating coverage Friday starting around 1 pm .
3 . That said , the Clinton campaign pushback in the first 12 hours was hard and effective . I have up on my screen the home pages of The New York Times and The Washington Post . The headlines aren ’ t just about “ New Clinton Email Scandal Erupts , ” which one might have expected . The Times leads with how the story “ Jolts Race ” but also notes that Clinton demanded Friday night that Comey release everything the bureau knows and adds a sidebar that Comey is under fire for his handling of this . The Washington Post home page is even more circumspect , with three headlines saying Clinton urges FBI to explain ; Comey under fire ; and Clinton campaign blasts decision ( a fourth headline emphasized Trump ’ s delighted reaction ) . That kind of homepage treatment tells us the phase one pushback was pretty effective in making journalism , after that initial rush , say “ hey , wait a minute . ”
4 . Today , Saturday , is critical . There are a few key questions that need firm answers , questions to which we ’ ve all read all kinds of answers , depending on who was doing the leaking . One , how many emails to Clinton are we talking about ? One reads about “ thousands , ” but if you read closely that ’ s a reference to the number of emails on the laptop , not the number from Abedin to Clinton . Was that 100 , or 50 , or three ?
Then there ’ s this paragraph from the Los Angeles Times write-up Friday : “ The emails were not to or from Clinton , and contained information that appeared to be more of what agents had already uncovered , the official said , but in an abundance of caution , they felt they needed to further scrutinize them. ” Seriously ? Not even to or from her ? If that ’ s true , why are we even hearing about this ?
Comey now has to provide answers to all these questions soon . Like today or tomorrow . And then we ’ ll just have to see . If it ’ s all benign , I think most of the toothpaste that splattered out Friday afternoon can actually be squeezed back into the tube . And if it ’ s not , then Clinton may well be in deep trouble .
And what if it ’ s somewhere in between—if there ’ s even one email that has the State and intelligence bureaucracies haggling over whether one little kernel of information about opposition groups in Burundi should have been classified ? Sometimes , even when there ’ s only smoke , people die of smoke inhalation . In that kind of circumstance , Clinton will have to step up and frame this conversation the way she needs it to be framed .
This takes us back to 1992 . On February 6 , exactly 12 days before the New Hampshire primary , The Wall Street Journal broke the story about Bill Clinton ’ s famous letter to that Arkansas ROTC colonel thanking him for helping him avoid the draft and using that phrase about accepting the risk of being drafted so as to maintain his “ political viability. ” It was devastating . Clinton ’ s poll numbers were dropping , as he later recalled , “ like a turd in a well . ”
Some aides counseled withdrawal , but Bill was having none of that . He campaigned nonstop and told voters in essence , don ’ t let the media and others decide this for you , and don ’ t let it be about past actions . It ’ s about your future . It worked well enough for him to finish second to Paul Tsongas ( a near favorite-son candidate ) , which counted as a moral victory . George Stephanopoulos wrote in his memoir that Clinton persuaded voters that “ the best way to strike a blow against the obsession with scandal was to vote for the candidate most plagued by scandal . ”
The difference is that the draft letter was 23 years old , while the email story is decidedly not . But the need to shift the conversation in that general direction is very much the same . She ’ s been tough in this race , as I noted recently . But she ’ s clearly going to have to get tougher still .","We should have known, I guess, that it wasn’t going to be that easy.

Peter Strzok -- a top counterintelligence official involved in both the Hillary Clinton email probe and FBI Special Counsel Robert Mueller ’ s Russia probe -- exchanged more than 50,000 messages with senior FBI lawyer Lisa Page , with whom he was romantically involved .
House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy , R-S.C. , and Rep. John Ratcliffe , R-Texas , said Monday that among the messages the pair exchanged are references to a “ secret society ” within the Department of Justice and the FBI .

“ I ’ m not saying that actually happened , but when folks speak in those terms , they need to come forward to explain the context with which they used those terms , ” he added .

According to the Wall Street Journal , Strzok claims the message was addressing a colleague who felt the FBI could take its time with allegations of Trump/Russia collusion because Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was thought certain to win .
`` Andy , '' meanwhile , may have been a reference to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe , who is at the center of new tensions with the Trump administration .
Axios reported late Monday that Attorney General Jeff Sessions , urged by President Trump , has been pressuring FBI Director Christopher Wray to fire McCabe .
The outlet reported that Wray threatened to resign if McCabe was fired . White House Counsel Don McGahn reportedly told Sessions that McCabe wasn ’ t worth losing the FBI director over and risking another media firestorm like when Trump axed former director James Comey last year .
The developments come as the DOJ announced that the FBI “ failed to preserve ” five months of texts between Strzok and Page .
“ We will leave no stone unturned to confirm with certainty why these text messages are not now available to be produced and will use every technology available to determine whether the missing messages are recoverable from another source , ” Sessions said in a statement provided to Fox News . “ If we are successful , we will update the congressional committees immediately . ”
The missing messages from Strzok and Page span a crucial window , between the presidential transition and the launch of Mueller ’ s Russia probe . Strzok was removed from the probe by Mueller after he learned of the messages .

'So of course I’m going to want to know what secret society you’re talking about because you’re supposed to be investigating objectively the person who just won the Electoral College, so yeah I’m going to want to know.' — Rep. Trey Gowdy

“I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy’s office — that there’s no way he gets elected — but I’m afraid we can’t take that risk. It’s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you’re 40…” he wrote.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Strzok claims the message was addressing a colleague who felt the FBI could take its time with allegations of Trump/Russia collusion because Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was thought certain to win.

""Andy,"" meanwhile, may have been a reference to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who is at the center of new tensions with the Trump administration.

Axios reported late Monday that Attorney General Jeff Sessions, urged by President Trump, has been pressuring FBI Director Christopher Wray to fire McCabe.

The outlet reported that Wray threatened to resign if McCabe was fired. White House Counsel Don McGahn reportedly told Sessions that McCabe wasn’t worth losing the FBI director over and risking another media firestorm like when Trump axed former director James Comey last year.

The developments come as the DOJ announced that the FBI “failed to preserve” five months of texts between Strzok and Page.

“We will leave no stone unturned to confirm with certainty why these text messages are not now available to be produced and will use every technology available to determine whether the missing messages are recoverable from another source,” Sessions said in a statement provided to Fox News. “If we are successful, we will update the congressional committees immediately.”

The missing messages from Strzok and Page span a crucial window, between the presidential transition and the launch of Mueller’s Russia probe. Strzok was removed from the probe by Mueller after he learned of the messages.

On Tuesday, President Trump described the missing messages as ""one of the biggest stories in a long time.""

Recently I've been listening to the Podcast ""Slow Burn,"" about Watergate. There's a fascinating theme throughout it: when you're living a historical event, how do you know? How can you tell when a development is a Big Deal? This is a big deal. It's very early on, but here's some things we can already tell...it's not just that the office thought that there was enough for a search warrant. They thought there was enough for a search warrant of an attorney's office for that attorney's client communications. That's a very fraught and extraordinary move that requires multiple levels of authorization within the Department of Justice... - The feds are only supposed to raid a law firm if less intrusive measures won't work. - Such a search requires high-level approval. The USAM requires such a search warrant to be approved by the U.S. Attorney — the head of the office, a Presidential appointee [my note: a Trump appointee] — and requires ""consultation"" with the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. - Such a search requires an elaborate review process. The basic rule is that the government may not deliberately seize, or review, attorney-client communications. The USAM — and relevant caselaw — therefore require the feds to set up a review process. - A Magistrate Judge signed off on this. Federal magistrate judges (appointed by local district judges, not by the President) review search warrant applications. A Magistrate Judge therefore reviewed this application and found probable cause — that is, probable cause to believe that the subject premises (Cohen's office) contains specified evidence of a specified federal crime.

fbi,BBC News,1,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50706835,Pensacola attack is presumed terrorism - FBI,,,"The FBI says it is treating Friday 's deadly attack on a Florida navy base as a presumed terrorist attack .
The Saudi gunman - who was training at the Pensacola site - killed three sailors before he was shot dead .
Special agent Rachel Rojas said the FBI was trying to determine if he had acted alone or had connections to a group .
She said other Saudi students had been questioned but not arrested . They were reportedly confined to the base and co-operating with investigators .
The victims of the attack have been named as Joshua Kaleb Watson , 23 , Mohammed Sameh Haitham , 19 , and Cameron Scott Walters , 21 .
The US Navy said the sailors `` showed exceptional heroism and bravery in the face of evil '' .
In Sunday 's press conference , Ms Rojas gave almost no details of the investigation 's findings so far .
However , she did say that the gunman , 21-year-old Mohammed Alshamrani , bought his weapon legally in the US . It was a 9mm handgun .
It has been reported in US media that Alshamrani played mass-shooting videos to others at a dinner earlier in the week , according to an anonymous official briefed on the investigation .
A Twitter user appearing to match Alshamrani 's identity also made a series of anti-US posts before the shooting , an online monitoring group says .
Alshamrani had also filed a formal complaint against one of his instructors over a nickname which he said had humiliated him .
Alshamrani alleged the instructor had called him `` Porn Stash '' , an apparent reference to the moustache of a porn actor , in front of 10 other aviation students in April .
`` I was infuriated as to why he would say that in front of the class , '' Alshamrani wrote in the complaint , the New York Times reported .
At a separate press conference on Sunday , Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said the gunman had `` a major social media trail '' and called for more stringent security measures .
`` This guy was somebody who just had a deep-seated hatred for the United States and that was pretty clear from that , '' he said .
`` My view is that ... for us to be bringing in these foreign nationals , you have to take precautions to protect the country . ''
The Pensacola base has long offered aviation training to foreign military forces .
Saudi pilots started training there in 1995 , alongside other personnel from Italy , Singapore and Germany .
Cpt Kinsella Jnr said that about 200 international students were enrolled in programmes there . According to its website , the base employs more than 16,000 military and 7,400 civilian personnel .
Alshamrani was a second lieutenant in the Saudi Air Force .
Earlier US Defence Secretary Mark Esper ordered a review of the screening process for foreign military in the US .
Mr Esper told Fox News Sunday he had instructed top defence officials to look into security measures at bases .
President Donald Trump has also pledged to review foreign military programmes .
Authorities were alerted to the shooting at the Pensacola base at 06:51 ( 11:51 GMT ) .
It took place across two floors of a classroom building and ended when a sheriff 's deputy killed Alshamrani .
Eight people were also injured in the shooting , including two officers , who are expected to recover .
Family members of Joshua Kaleb Watson said he was shot several times but made it out of the building to alert first responders .
On Facebook , his brother Adam Watson wrote : `` He died a hero and we are beyond proud but there is a hole in our hearts that can never be filled . ''
Capt Tim Kinsella , the base 's commanding officer , said of the three sailors killed : `` When confronted , they did n't run from danger ; they ran towards it and saved lives . ''
Saudi Arabia is a key US ally in the Middle East and President Trump said the Saudi king called him after the attack to `` express his sincere condolences and give his sympathies to the families and friends of the warriors who were killed '' .
Just as he did in the wake of the murder of the dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in his country 's consulate in Istanbul , President Trump is seeking to play down the significance of the Pensacola shooting .
For a president who largely sees foreign policy in transactional terms , Saudi Arabia is a great customer for the US . Billions of dollars in weapons sales translates into more than 5,500 temporary visas being issued to the Saudi military to come to the US . Saudi personnel make up about 16 % of the foreign personnel being trained at US military schools and other facilities . The Pensacola shooting is already raising questions about the vetting of these individuals .

The Saudi gunman - who was training at the Pensacola site - killed three sailors before he was shot dead.

Special agent Rachel Rojas said the FBI was trying to determine if he had acted alone or had connections to a group.

She said other Saudi students had been questioned but not arrested. They were reportedly confined to the base and co-operating with investigators.

The victims of the attack have been named as Joshua Kaleb Watson, 23, Mohammed Sameh Haitham, 19, and Cameron Scott Walters, 21.

The US Navy said the sailors ""showed exceptional heroism and bravery in the face of evil"".

In Sunday's press conference, Ms Rojas gave almost no details of the investigation's findings so far.

However, she did say that the gunman, 21-year-old Mohammed Alshamrani, bought his weapon legally in the US. It was a 9mm handgun.

It has been reported in US media that Alshamrani played mass-shooting videos to others at a dinner earlier in the week, according to an anonymous official briefed on the investigation.

A Twitter user appearing to match Alshamrani's identity also made a series of anti-US posts before the shooting, an online monitoring group says.

Alshamrani had also filed a formal complaint against one of his instructors over a nickname which he said had humiliated him.

Alshamrani alleged the instructor had called him ""Porn Stash"", an apparent reference to the moustache of a porn actor, in front of 10 other aviation students in April.

""I was infuriated as to why he would say that in front of the class,"" Alshamrani wrote in the complaint, the New York Times reported.

At a separate press conference on Sunday, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said the gunman had ""a major social media trail"" and called for more stringent security measures.

""This guy was somebody who just had a deep-seated hatred for the United States and that was pretty clear from that,"" he said.

""My view is that... for us to be bringing in these foreign nationals, you have to take precautions to protect the country.""

Why were Saudis at the US base?

The Pensacola base has long offered aviation training to foreign military forces.

Saudi pilots started training there in 1995, alongside other personnel from Italy, Singapore and Germany.

Cpt Kinsella Jnr said that about 200 international students were enrolled in programmes there. According to its website, the base employs more than 16,000 military and 7,400 civilian personnel.

Alshamrani was a second lieutenant in the Saudi Air Force.

Earlier US Defence Secretary Mark Esper ordered a review of the screening process for foreign military in the US.

Mr Esper told Fox News Sunday he had instructed top defence officials to look into security measures at bases.

President Donald Trump has also pledged to review foreign military programmes.

What happened on Friday?

Authorities were alerted to the shooting at the Pensacola base at 06:51 (11:51 GMT).

It took place across two floors of a classroom building and ended when a sheriff's deputy killed Alshamrani.

Eight people were also injured in the shooting, including two officers, who are expected to recover.

Family members of Joshua Kaleb Watson said he was shot several times but made it out of the building to alert first responders.

On Facebook, his brother Adam Watson wrote: ""He died a hero and we are beyond proud but there is a hole in our hearts that can never be filled.""

Capt Tim Kinsella, the base's commanding officer, said of the three sailors killed: ""When confronted, they didn't run from danger; they ran towards it and saved lives.""

Saudi Arabia is a key US ally in the Middle East and President Trump said the Saudi king called him after the attack to ""express his sincere condolences and give his sympathies to the families and friends of the warriors who were killed"".

Questions over the US-Saudi relationship

Just as he did in the wake of the murder of the dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in his country's consulate in Istanbul, President Trump is seeking to play down the significance of the Pensacola shooting.

For a president who largely sees foreign policy in transactional terms, Saudi Arabia is a great customer for the US. Billions of dollars in weapons sales translates into more than 5,500 temporary visas being issued to the Saudi military to come to the US. Saudi personnel make up about 16% of the foreign personnel being trained at US military schools and other facilities. The Pensacola shooting is already raising questions about the vetting of these individuals.

During an “unrelated investigation”* it uncovered e-mails that “appear to be pertinent” to Clinton’s case.

WASHINGTON – A scheme in which women were allegedly offered money to falsely implicate Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller in sexual misconduct has been referred to the FBI for review, Mueller's spokesman said Tuesday.

The hoax surfaced more than a week ago when a number of journalists were contacted via email by a person who reported receiving a telephone call from an individual making the offer.

“When we learned last week of allegations that women were offered money to make false claims about the special counsel, we immediately referred the matter to the FBI for investigation,"" Mueller spokesman Peter Carr said.

Mueller, who leads the inquiry into Russia's interference in the 2016 election, has been the target of a barrage of criticism from President Donald Trump and some of his Republican allies in Congress who have accused the special counsel of unfairly targeting the president.

One of the journalists who was contacted, a correspondent for HillReporter.com, recounted the bizarre episode in an article published Tuesday.

The alleged offer, according to the publication, came from a man who proposed paying off the person's credit card debt, and issuing a check for $20,000. According article, the caller then asked the person to move to an encrypted communications application where he could elaborate on the proposition.

""Reluctantly, I downloaded the app and he called me on that app a few minutes later,"" the person said in the email to the reporter. ""He said (and I will never forget exactly what it was) 'I want you to make accusations of sexual misconduct and workplace harassment against Robert Mueller, and I want you to sign a sworn affidavit to that effect.'”

When the reporter sought to follow up by telephone with the writer of the email, believed to be a woman from Fort Myers, Fla., no one by the person's given name could be found.

HillReporter.com ""looked into this woman, as did many other journalists we have spoken with, and we all reached a conclusion that this was likely a hoax of some sort,"" the publication said. ""No one by the name given lived in Fort Myers.""

The initial email to reporters indicated that the alleged backer of the scheme was conservative radio talk show host Jack Burkman.

Burkman, whose show Behind the Curtain promises to ""expose the dark secrets"" of the capital, went to Twitter Tuesday to announce he would offer more information Thursday.

In addition to Trump and Republican lawmakers, conservative pundits have help drive criticism of Mueller in an attempt to derail the inquiry.

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — Robert Mueller paused . He refused to speculate . He made constant references to his report — but wasn ’ t sure of a number of things in it .

( FBI via AP )
WASHINGTON ( AP ) — The gunman who killed three U.S. sailors at a military base in Florida last year communicated with al-Qaida operatives about planning and tactics in the months leading up to the attack , U.S. officials said Monday , as they lashed out at Apple for failing to help them open the shooter ’ s phones so they could access key evidence .
Law enforcement officials discovered contacts between Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani and operatives of al-Qaida after FBI technicians succeeded in breaking into two cellphones that had previously been locked and that the shooter , a Saudi Air Force officer , had tried to destroy before he was killed by a sheriff ’ s deputy .
“ We now have a clearer understanding of Alshamrani ’ s associations and activities in the years , months and days leading up to his attack , ” Attorney General William Barr said at a news conference in which he chastised Apple for not helping open the phones .
The new details , including that Alshamrani had been radicalized abroad before he arrived in the U.S. , raise fresh questions about the vetting of foreign military members and trainees who spend time at American bases . The announcement also comes amid tension with the U.S. over instability in the oil market during the coronavirus pandemic and as the Trump administration faces criticism that it has not done enough to hold the kingdom , which has been trying to improve its international image , accountable for human rights violations .
The criticism directed at Apple could also escalate divisions between the U.S. government and the technology company , which rejected the characterization that it has been unhelpful . The company said Monday that it does not store customers ’ passcodes , does not have the capacity to unlock passcode-protected devices and that weakening encryption could create vulnerabilities that undermine national secuity and data privacy .
Alshamrani was killed by a sheriff ’ s deputy during the Dec. 6 rampage at a classroom building at Naval Air Station Pensacola . He had been undergoing flight training at Pensacola as part of instruction offered at American military bases to foreign nationals . Besides the three sailors who died , eight other people were injured .
Once unlocked , U.S. officials said , the phones revealed contact between Alshamrani and “ dangerous ” operatives from al-Qaida in the Arabian Pensinsula , or AQAP , that continued until shortly before the shooting . They also revealed that he had been radicalized since at least 2015 , before he arrived in the U.S. , and had meticulously planned the attack .
Alshamrani created minicam videos as he cased a military school building and saved a will on his phone that purported to explain himself — the same document AQAP released after the shooting when it claimed responsibility for it , said FBI Director Chris Wray , who called the attack “ the brutal culmination of years of planning and preparation . ”
“ He wasn ’ t just coordinating with them about planning and tactics , ” Wray said . “ He was helping the organization make the most it could out of his murders . ”
Asked whether al-Qaida had directed or inspired the attacks , Wray said it was “ certainly more than just inspired . ”
The phones have already yielded valuable intelligence , officials said , citing a recent counterterrorism operation in Yemen that targeted an AQAP associate Alshamrani had been in touch with .
The Justice Department had asked Apple to help extract data from two iPhones that belonged to the gunman , including one that authorities say Alshamrani damaged with a bullet after being confronted by law enforcement .
But Wray said Apple provided “ effectively no help , ” delaying by months the FBI ’ s ability to access the devices and hampering the investigation since agents did not have a full picture of what to look for or ask about . He did not say what method was used to open the phones , but said it was a targeted fix and not a broad solution to the problem .
Barr used Monday ’ s news conference to forcefully call on Apple to do more to cooperate with law enforcement .
“ In cases like this , where the user is a terrorist , or in other cases , where the user is a violent criminal , a human trafficker , a child predator , Apple ’ s decision has dangerous consequences for public safety and the national security and is , in my judgment , unacceptable , ” Barr said .
In a statement Monday , Apple said it had provided the FBI with “ every piece of information available to us , including iCloud backups , account information and transactional data for multiple accounts. ” It rejected the idea of making its products more accessible for law enforcement ’ s benefit .
“ It is because we take our responsibility to national security so seriously that we do not believe in the creation of a backdoor — one which will make every device vulnerable to bad actors who threaten our national security and the data security of our customers , ” the statement said . “ There is no such thing as a backdoor just for the good guys , and the American people do not have to choose between weakening encryption and effective investigations .
Law enforcement officials had previously left no doubt that Alshamrani was motivated by jihadist ideology , saying he visited a New York City memorial to the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend and posted anti-American and anti-Israeli messages on social media just hours before the shooting .
Separately , AQAP , al-Qaida ’ s branch in Yemen , released a video claiming the attack . AQAP has long been considered the global network ’ s most dangerous branch .
In January , U.S. officials announced that they were sending home 21 Saudi military students after an investigation revealed that they had had jihadist or anti-American sentiments on social media pages or had “ contact with child pornography . ”
Operational training for Saudi students at multiple U.S bases was suspended soon after the shooting , but the Pentagon has since given the Navy and other military services conditional approval to resume the instruction .
Barr said Monday that the Saudis have been cooperative and have worked with the U.S. to buttress vetting .

fbi,Fox Online News,2,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/michael-flynn-fbi-handwritten-notes-get-him-lie-fired,"FBI discussed interviewing Michael Flynn 'to get him to lie' and 'get him fired,' handwritten notes show",,Gregg Re,"Explosive new internal FBI documents unsealed Wednesday show that top bureau officials discussed their motivations for interviewing then-national security adviser Michael Flynn in the White House in January 2017 -- and openly questioned if their `` goal '' was `` to get him to lie , so we can prosecute him or get him fired . ''
The handwritten notes -- written by the FBI 's former head of counterintelligence Bill Priestap after a meeting with then-FBI Director James Comey and then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe , Fox News is told -- further suggested that agents planned in the alternative to get Flynn `` to admit to breaking the Logan Act '' when he spoke to then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition period .
The Logan Act is an obscure statute that has never been used in a criminal prosecution ; enacted in 1799 in an era before telephones , it was intended to prevent individuals from falsely claiming to represent the United States government abroad .
`` What is our goal ? '' one of the notes read . `` Truth/Admission or to get him to lie , so we can prosecute him or get him fired ? ''
`` If we get him to admit to breaking the Logan Act , give facts to DOJ + have them decide , '' another note read . Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley called the document 's implications `` chilling . ''
The memo appears to weigh the pros and cons of pursuing those different paths . `` I do n't see how getting someone to admit their wrongdoing is going easy on him , '' one note reads . Flynn did not ultimately admit to wrongdoing in the interview .
The document indicates that the agents at least discussed the merits of a by-the-book approach : `` If we ’ re seen as playing games , WH [ White House ] will be furious . ''
The bombshell materials strongly suggested the agents were n't truly concerned about Flynn 's intercepted contacts with Kislyak during the presidential transition period , except as a pretext .
Former President Obama personally had warned the Trump administration against hiring Flynn , and made clear he was `` not a fan , '' according to multiple officials . Obama fired Flynn as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014 .
The Justice Department turned over the documents just this week , even though a February 2018 standing order in the case from United States District Court for the District of Columbia Emmet Sullivan required the government to turn over any exculpatory materials in its possession that pertained to Flynn . Such materials ordinarily do not need to be disclosed to uncharged individuals or those who have already pleaded guilty , Sullivan has ruled , although the matter remains unresolved by the Supreme Court . Some circuits have suggested the opposite .
Fox News is told even more exculpatory documents are forthcoming , as Attorney General Bill Barr continues to oversee the DOJ 's investigation into the handling of the Flynn case .
Flynn previously charged that top FBI officials , including McCabe , pressed him not to have the White House counsel present during the questioning with two agents that led to his guilty plea on a single charge of lying to federal authorities . Flynn was not charged with any Logan Act violation .
DOJ OUTLINES SLEW OF SECURITY VIOLATIONS BY STRZOK , WHO TEXTED ABOUT HIS AFFAIR & HATRED FOR TRUMP
One of Flynn 's interviewing agents was Peter Strzok , who has since been fired from the bureau after his anti-Trump text messages came to light . ( The other interviewing agent , most likely Supervisory Special Agent Joe Pientka , has been scrubbed from the FBI website after Fox News asked the bureau about him , and he has largely evaded scrutiny -- despite his key role in both the Flynn probe and Carter Page investigations . )
Flynn has sought to withdraw his guilty plea and has been seeking exoneration , saying the FBI engaged in `` egregious misconduct . '' Flynn , who has said more recently that he did not lie to the FBI , pleaded guilty in late 2017 as mounting legal fees pushed him to sell his home . Prosecutors have suggested Flynn 's guilty plea allowed him to escape liability for a possible charge under the Foreign Agents Registration Act ( FARA ) , another little-known and once-rarely used law , for his alleged work in Turkey .
Flynn has since obtained new counsel -- and his old attorneys , it emerged this week , then failed to turn over thousands of documents to his new lawyer , Sidney Powell . Powell has maintained that Flynn 's old lawyers at Covington & Burling had conflicts of interest and were otherwise ineffective , including by not focusing on Strzok 's evident bias .
`` It 's just absolutely appalling what these agents , and then special counsel operatives , did to General Flynn , '' Powell told Fox News ' `` Hannity '' on Wednesday night . `` It 's abuse of their authority at every turn . ''
`` I interpret the notes as absolutely damning of their conduct and their plan , '' Powell went on . `` They rejected the advice of the apparent lawyer who wrote on the handwritten note that they not play games with the White House and instead that is exactly what they did .
MEDIA 'EXPERTS ' INSISTED THAT FISA PROCESS WAS ROBUST -- BUT DOJ FINDS FATAL FLAWS WITH KEY FISA WARRANTS
`` Their standard practice in other cases [ is ] to warn of a [ Section ] 1001 violation [ for making false statements to federal investigators ] , '' Powell continued . `` None of that applied to General Flynn . They had only special violations , of every protocol known for him because they were determined to take him out . ''
Strzok was n't the only top FBI official who apparently bent the rules in targeting Flynn . Comey admitted in 2018 that the fateful Flynn interview at the White House did n't follow protocol , and came at his direction . He said it was not `` something I probably would n't have done or maybe gotten away with in a more ... organized administration . ''
McCabe later said the interview was `` very odd '' because `` it seemed like [ Flynn ] was telling the truth '' to the two agents who interviewed him . Flynn , the interviewing agents told McCabe , `` had a very good recollection of events , which he related chronologically and lucidly , '' did not appear to be `` nervous or sweating , '' and did not look `` side to side '' -- all of which would have been `` behavioral signs of deception . ''
During the interview , Flynn told the agents `` not really '' when asked if he had sought to convince Kislyak not to escalate a brewing fight with the U.S. over sanctions imposed by the Obama administration , according to a FD-302 witness report prepared by the FBI . Flynn also demurred when asked if he had asked Russia to veto a U.N. Security Council resolution that condemned Israel ’ s settlements in the West Bank .

The handwritten notes -- written by the FBI's former head of counterintelligence Bill Priestap after a meeting with then-FBI Director James Comey and then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, Fox News is told -- further suggested that agents planned in the alternative to get Flynn ""to admit to breaking the Logan Act"" when he spoke to then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition period.

The Logan Act is an obscure statute that has never been used in a criminal prosecution; enacted in 1799 in an era before telephones, it was intended to prevent individuals from falsely claiming to represent the United States government abroad.

""What is our goal?"" one of the notes read. ""Truth/Admission or to get him to lie, so we can prosecute him or get him fired?""

""If we get him to admit to breaking the Logan Act, give facts to DOJ + have them decide,"" another note read. Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley called the document's implications ""chilling.""

The memo appears to weigh the pros and cons of pursuing those different paths. ""I don't see how getting someone to admit their wrongdoing is going easy on him,"" one note reads. Flynn did not ultimately admit to wrongdoing in the interview.

The document indicates that the agents at least discussed the merits of a by-the-book approach: ""If we’re seen as playing games, WH [White House] will be furious.""

The bombshell materials strongly suggested the agents weren't truly concerned about Flynn's intercepted contacts with Kislyak during the presidential transition period, except as a pretext.

Former President Obama personally had warned the Trump administration against hiring Flynn, and made clear he was ""not a fan,"" according to multiple officials. Obama fired Flynn as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014.

READ THE UNSEALED FBI EMAILS, HANDWRITTEN DOCUMENTS

The Justice Department turned over the documents just this week, even though a February 2018 standing order in the case from United States District Court for the District of Columbia Emmet Sullivan required the government to turn over any exculpatory materials in its possession that pertained to Flynn. Such materials ordinarily do not need to be disclosed to uncharged individuals or those who have already pleaded guilty, Sullivan has ruled, although the matter remains unresolved by the Supreme Court. Some circuits have suggested the opposite.

Fox News is told even more exculpatory documents are forthcoming, as Attorney General Bill Barr continues to oversee the DOJ's investigation into the handling of the Flynn case.

Flynn previously charged that top FBI officials, including McCabe, pressed him not to have the White House counsel present during the questioning with two agents that led to his guilty plea on a single charge of lying to federal authorities. Flynn was not charged with any Logan Act violation.

DOJ OUTLINES SLEW OF SECURITY VIOLATIONS BY STRZOK, WHO TEXTED ABOUT HIS AFFAIR & HATRED FOR TRUMP

One of Flynn's interviewing agents was Peter Strzok, who has since been fired from the bureau after his anti-Trump text messages came to light. (The other interviewing agent, most likely Supervisory Special Agent Joe Pientka, has been scrubbed from the FBI website after Fox News asked the bureau about him, and he has largely evaded scrutiny -- despite his key role in both the Flynn probe and Carter Page investigations.)

Flynn has sought to withdraw his guilty plea and has been seeking exoneration, saying the FBI engaged in ""egregious misconduct."" Flynn, who has said more recently that he did not lie to the FBI, pleaded guilty in late 2017 as mounting legal fees pushed him to sell his home. Prosecutors have suggested Flynn's guilty plea allowed him to escape liability for a possible charge under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), another little-known and once-rarely used law, for his alleged work in Turkey.

Flynn has since obtained new counsel -- and his old attorneys, it emerged this week, then failed to turn over thousands of documents to his new lawyer, Sidney Powell. Powell has maintained that Flynn's old lawyers at Covington & Burling had conflicts of interest and were otherwise ineffective, including by not focusing on Strzok's evident bias.

""It's just absolutely appalling what these agents, and then special counsel operatives, did to General Flynn,"" Powell told Fox News' ""Hannity"" on Wednesday night. ""It's abuse of their authority at every turn.""

""I interpret the notes as absolutely damning of their conduct and their plan,"" Powell went on. ""They rejected the advice of the apparent lawyer who wrote on the handwritten note that they not play games with the White House and instead that is exactly what they did.

MEDIA 'EXPERTS' INSISTED THAT FISA PROCESS WAS ROBUST -- BUT DOJ FINDS FATAL FLAWS WITH KEY FISA WARRANTS

""Their standard practice in other cases [is] to warn of a [Section] 1001 violation [for making false statements to federal investigators],"" Powell continued. ""None of that applied to General Flynn. They had only special violations, of every protocol known for him because they were determined to take him out.""

Strzok wasn't the only top FBI official who apparently bent the rules in targeting Flynn. Comey admitted in 2018 that the fateful Flynn interview at the White House didn't follow protocol, and came at his direction. He said it was not ""something I probably wouldn't have done or maybe gotten away with in a more... organized administration.""

McCabe later said the interview was ""very odd"" because ""it seemed like [Flynn] was telling the truth"" to the two agents who interviewed him. Flynn, the interviewing agents told McCabe, ""had a very good recollection of events, which he related chronologically and lucidly,"" did not appear to be ""nervous or sweating,"" and did not look ""side to side"" -- all of which would have been ""behavioral signs of deception.""

During the interview, Flynn told the agents ""not really"" when asked if he had sought to convince Kislyak not to escalate a brewing fight with the U.S. over sanctions imposed by the Obama administration, according to a FD-302 witness report prepared by the FBI. Flynn also demurred when asked if he had asked Russia to veto a U.N. Security Council resolution that condemned Israel’s settlements in the West Bank. (The Obama administration abstained in that vote.)

Thus, it appears that one man with a strident political agenda accomplished his twin goals of clearing Clinton and accusing Trump, evidence be damned.

And then he was caught.

The Strzok Bust and Cover-up

The Department of Justice inspector general, Michael Horowitz, discovered the electronic texts Strzok exchanged with his lover, FBI lawyer Lisa Page. The messages were so politically incendiary and so threatened the integrity of Mueller’s investigation that Strzok was quietly canned over the summer from the special counsel team, where he was a pivotal participant.

The Trump-Russia investigation is now awash in illegitimacy.

Did Mueller or anyone else notify Congress that both the Trump investigation --and the Clinton case before it-- were corrupted? Of course not. This was covered up. Mueller surely knew that if the truth were revealed, it would further discredit a Trump-Russia probe that had already taken on the stench of dead fish.

The House Intelligence Committee could smell it and knew something was amiss. It demanded answers. But the Justice Department and the FBI refused to respond or otherwise produce relevant documents that the committee subpoenaed. They are still stonewalling many of Congress’s valid requests and should now face contempt charges.

Importantly, all of the anti-Trump and pro-Clinton messages should be made public. Americans should decide for themselves whether our system of justice has been compromised by unscrupulous influences.

Just how rife with political prejudice and corrupt motives is the special counsel’s investigation?

Instead of choosing prosecutors who could be neutral, fair and objective, Mueller stacked his staff with D emocratic donors . Apparently, he conducted little or no vetting of both prosecutors and investigators. How else does one explain the presence of Strzok and Lisa Page on the investigative team?

It appears that Mueller selected people of a particular political persuasion without discerning review or scrutiny. We were supposed to simply trust Mueller’s judgment, notwithstanding his own disqualifying conflict of interest under the special counsel statute that demanded his recusal.

The Trump-Russia investigation is now awash in illegitimacy. Mueller and those who work for him have squandered all credibility. It is imperative that the special counsel be dismissed, the current staff fired, and a new counsel appointed to re-evaluate the evidence objectively.

Every member of Mueller’s hand-picked staff must now be examined. The special counsel has proven he cannot be trusted with his assembled team of partisans.

Do not expect Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to make these changes. He, too, should be removed in his capacity as Mueller’s supervisor. As both a witness and prosecutor, Rosenstein has his own conspicuous and disabling conflict of interest. Yet he has refused to step aside. Attorney General Jeff Sessions is duty-bound to remove both Mueller and Rosenstein.

Are There Other Emails?

Given what we know about the composition of the special counsel team, there may well be others who harbor a blatant political bias and have expressed their animus toward Trump in emails or texts. The computer accounts of the entire staff need to be examined by Congress and the DOJ Inspector General. Failing that, news organizations should file a request under the Freedom of Information Act.

The examination should begin with Andrew Weissmann, who has close ties to Hui Chen, whom he hired at the Justice Department and with whom he worked at the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Eastern District of New York.

Every member of Mueller’s hand-picked staff must now be examined. The special counsel has proven he cannot be trusted with his assembled team of partisans.

The Sham Investigation of Clinton

It never made sense that Hillary Clinton escaped criminal prosecution for mishandling classified documents.

The Espionage Act makes it a crime to mishandle classified documents “through gross negligence” (18 USC 793-f). With 110 emails on Clinton’s private server that were classified at the time they were sent or received, only illogical legal gymnastics driven by corruption could clear her.

Enter Strzok. It turns out, he is the person who altered former Director Comey's early draft describing Clinton’s actions as criminal under the law. But later, the words “grossly negligent” were crossed out and the language “extremely careless” was substituted. Although the two terms are synonymous, the former terminology is specifically stated in the statute while the latter is not.

It appears that Strzok, and perhaps Comey, knew Clinton violated the law but subsequently resolved to conjure a way to exonerate her by editing the language so that it seemed less culpable and more innocuous. Were these machinations driven by Strzok’s political agenda? Did he despise Trump so much that he devised a scheme to clear Clinton so that a criminal indictment would not impede her assent to the presidency?

Strzok, Comey and others who may have been involved must be put under oath to answer these vital questions.

In the meantime, the Department of Justice must now, belatedly, reopen the Clinton email case and re-examine fairly and impartially all of the evidence to determine whether criminal charges against her should be sought. The statute of limitations has not expired.

Sadly, the FBI is no longer the respected premier law enforcement agency in America. People like Strzok have politicized the bureau, discredited its work and done immeasurable damage. So, too, have Comey and Mueller.

The shock announcement came on Friday and sucked up political oxygen throughout the weekend , dominating cable news networks and the Sunday talk shows .
Democrats are furious about what they see as political meddling on the part of the bureau and its director , James Comey .
The Clinton campaign sent a release late Sunday evening signed by nearly 100 former prosecutors and Department of Justice officials questioning Comey ’ s “ break with longstanding practices ” by making public statements about an ongoing investigation or even acknowledging the existence of one .

Behind the scenes , GOP activists are gleeful about the prospect of the FBI announcement helping to shift down-ballot races , as well as the presidential contest , in their favor .
GOP control of the Senate has looked in serious danger , and Republicans will try to stave off the possibility of losing their majority by pressing Democrats onto the defensive . One endangered GOP senator , Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania , told a Philadelphia radio station soon after the news broke that “ it looks to me like Hillary Clinton is in a world of hot water . ”
Uncertainty on several key points is fueling the feverish atmosphere that has gripped the political world .
The impact of the Comey announcement on public opinion can not be reliably assessed because no major opinion polls have yet emerged that were conducted wholly in its aftermath .
But a Washington Post/ABC News tracking poll released on Sunday , which included data from both before and after the revelation , carried ominous news for Clinton .
The poll found that 34 percent of likely voters said they were “ less likely ” to vote for the Democratic nominee as a result of Comey ’ s announcement . A clear majority of those people were Republican or Republican-leaning , the Post reported , and therefore may never have intended to vote for Clinton .
But 17 percent of those who said they had been deterred from backing Clinton leaned Democratic , and a further 9 percent were self-described independents . Any shift in their ranks could be pivotal in an election that appeared to be tightening even before the Comey bombshell .
Also unknown is whether the FBI will make further comment on the matter before Election Day .
Many experts believe such comment is unlikely given that agents only obtained a search warrant to look through the relevant emails — some 650,000 — on Sunday .
The ultimate conclusion to the matter could fall anywhere on a very broad spectrum .

The shock announcement came on Friday and sucked up political oxygen throughout the weekend, dominating cable news networks and the Sunday talk shows.

Democrats are furious about what they see as political meddling on the part of the bureau and its director, James Comey.

The Clinton campaign sent a release late Sunday evening signed by nearly 100 former prosecutors and Department of Justice officials questioning Comey’s “break with longstanding practices” by making public statements about an ongoing investigation or even acknowledging the existence of one.

Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid Harry Mason ReidThe Trumpification of the federal courts Trump to rally evangelicals after critical Christianity Today editorial Left presses 2020 Democrats to retake the courts from Trump MORE (D-Nev.) suggested on Sunday that Comey may have violated the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal government officials from using their authority to influence an election.

Republicans, including presidential nominee Donald Trump Donald John TrumpDem lawmaker says Nunes threatened to sue him over criticism Parnas: U.S. ambassador to Ukraine removed to clear path for investigations into Bidens Five takeaways from Parnas's Maddow interview MORE, have commended the bureau. Behind the scenes, GOP activists are gleeful about the prospect of the FBI announcement helping to shift down-ballot races, as well as the presidential contest, in their favor.

GOP control of the Senate has looked in serious danger, and Republicans will try to stave off the possibility of losing their majority by pressing Democrats onto the defensive. One endangered GOP senator, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, told a Philadelphia radio station soon after the news broke that “it looks to me like Hillary Clinton is in a world of hot water.”

Uncertainty on several key points is fueling the feverish atmosphere that has gripped the political world.

The impact of the Comey announcement on public opinion cannot be reliably assessed because no major opinion polls have yet emerged that were conducted wholly in its aftermath.

But a Washington Post/ABC News tracking poll released on Sunday, which included data from both before and after the revelation, carried ominous news for Clinton.

The poll found that 34 percent of likely voters said they were “less likely” to vote for the Democratic nominee as a result of Comey’s announcement. A clear majority of those people were Republican or Republican-leaning, the Post reported, and therefore may never have intended to vote for Clinton.

But 17 percent of those who said they had been deterred from backing Clinton leaned Democratic, and a further 9 percent were self-described independents. Any shift in their ranks could be pivotal in an election that appeared to be tightening even before the Comey bombshell.

Also unknown is whether the FBI will make further comment on the matter before Election Day.

Many experts believe such comment is unlikely given that agents only obtained a search warrant to look through the relevant emails — some 650,000 — on Sunday.

The ultimate conclusion to the matter could fall anywhere on a very broad spectrum.

The emails, apparently found on a laptop once shared by close Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her estranged husband, former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.), could be mere duplicates of messages already examined by the FBI during its probe of the private email server Clinton used while secretary of State. If that were the case, Clinton might benefit from a perception that she had been smeared — and criticism of Comey would reach a new level.

At the other end of the range of possibilities, the emails could lead to the criminal indictment of a president-elect, a scenario that would envelop an already tense nation in chaos.

If Clinton were to lose the election on Nov. 8, it seems all but certain that disappointed supporters of the Democratic nominee would blame the FBI. Trump has stated a number of times that he believes the process is “rigged” against him, spurring fears that his most fervent backers will not accept the legitimacy of the outcome if he loses.

Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, asserted that Clinton has “a very casual relationship with the truth” on ABC’s “This Week” Sunday. She was building on a case already made by the nominee himself, who reacted to the Comey announcement by arguing that “Hillary Clinton’s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before.” In a statement, he warned voters not to let the former secretary of State “take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.”

But the Clinton team, moving past its initial shock at the news, has sought to shift onto a more aggressive footing. Campaign chairman John Podesta called Comey’s conduct “inappropriate” on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday, while Clinton’s running mate, Sen.

Earlier in the day, Trump broke a prolonged Twitter silence to brand Comey a leaker — and to declare his testimony had vindicated him.

Trump’s lawyers threatened, though as of Friday evening, had not yet filed, official complaints against the ousted FBI director. Comey’s disclosures may have violated bureau policies, and could lead to him being rebuked by the FBI or Justice Department. But agencies have little other recourse against former employees in these circumstances, legal experts said.

A finding that Comey breached FBI rules could do some damage to his reputation. However, there’s no history of cases like this being prosecuted criminally, lawyers said.

“For Comey, the greatest danger is not one of criminality, but of credibility,” said George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley. “What Comey did was grossly unprofessional. He actually, in my, view, hampered the investigation.”

FBI policy does appear to prohibit former employees from disclosing work-related records without advance clearance from the law enforcement agency.

“All information created and acquired by current and former employees … in connection with official FBI duties, as well as all official material to which FBI personnel have access, is the property of the United States,” FBI policy says. “FBI personnel must surrender all materials in their possession that contain FBI information upon FBI demand or upon separation from the FBI.”

Comey 's remarks before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee are his first public statements since he made that announcement Tuesday .
He said there was no evidence that showed Clinton knew what she was doing was illegal or that she lied to federal investigators .
At Thursday 's hearing , Comey also said his decision was not a coordinated effort with the White House or anyone else .
But Rep. John Mica , R-Fla. , called the timing of the FBI director 's announcement on Tuesday suspicious .
It came one week after Attorney General Loretta Lynch met privately with former President Bill Clinton and a few days after Hillary Clinton testified before the FBI .
A few hours after Comey 's announcement on Tuesday , President Barack Obama also joined Clinton on the campaign trail .
`` Our folks did it in an apolitical and a professional way , '' Comey insisted of the FBI 's investigation .
A number of Republicans implied there was a double standard for filing criminal charges against everyday people as opposed to people in high-level positions like Clinton .

''","FBI Director James Comey faced heated questions from lawmakers Thursday over the bureau's decision not file charges against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for using a personal email server to handle classified information.

Watch CBN News Reporter Caitlin Burke's earlier report above.

Comey's remarks before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee are his first public statements since he made that announcement Tuesday.

He said there was no evidence that showed Clinton knew what she was doing was illegal or that she lied to federal investigators.

At Thursday's hearing, Comey also said his decision was not a coordinated effort with the White House or anyone else.

But Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., called the timing of the FBI director's announcement on Tuesday suspicious.

It came one week after Attorney General Loretta Lynch met privately with former President Bill Clinton and a few days after Hillary Clinton testified before the FBI.

A few hours after Comey's announcement on Tuesday, President Barack Obama also joined Clinton on the campaign trail.

""Our folks did it in an apolitical and a professional way,"" Comey insisted of the FBI's investigation.

A number of Republicans implied there was a double standard for filing criminal charges against everyday people as opposed to people in high-level positions like Clinton.

""If your name isn't Clinton, or you're not part of the powerful elite, then Lady Justice will act differently,"" Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said. He added that the FBI had set a ""dangerous precedent"" in letting her off the hook.

Lawmakers wanted to know if Comey had been hearing that argument as well.

""I've heard it a lot,"" he said. ""It's not true, but I've heard it a lot.""

""I totally get people's questions,"" he said, but the FBI was obliged to follow the law.

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley released a letter late Thursday to FBI Director Christopher Wray asking if agents ever warned Donald Trump about possible attempts by the Russian government to infiltrate his campaign last year.

Grassley, whose committee is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, said federal agents warned Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., about Russian ties by his former campaign manager when McCain was running for president in 2008. But McCain's office issued a press release shortly before midnight disputing Grassley's assertion.

""If the FBI did provide a defensive briefing or similar warning to the (Trump) campaign, then that would raise important questions about how the Trump campaign responded,” Grassley, R-Iowa, wrote in a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray.

""On the other hand, if the FBI did not alert the campaign, then that would raise serious questions about what factors contributed to its decision and why it appears to have been handled differently in a very similar circumstance involving a previous campaign,"" Grassley wrote, referring to McCain's campaign.

McCain clearly took offense at being thrust into Grassley's letter to Wray. Grassley asked Wray to respond to the letter by Oct. 4.

""Neither Senator McCain nor anyone on his staff recalls receiving such warnings from the intelligence community,"" said McCain's spokeswoman, Julie Tarallo. ""Facts are stubborn things, and the fact is no member of Congress has done more to push back on Russian aggression, human rights abuses, and corruption than Senator John McCain. Any suggestion to the contrary is clearly intended to distract from the serious ongoing investigations into Russia’s interference in our election system.""

Grassley wrote the letter Wednesday after reports by CNN that the FBI began investigating former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his business dealings with the Russians in 2014. Those reports, cited by Grassley on Thursday, also allege that Manafort was the target of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act monitoring by the Obama administration last year when he was working as Trump's campaign manager.

""Further, former FBI Director James Comey publicly testified that the FBI began investigating ties between Trump campaign associates and Russians by July of 2016 and that President Trump was not under investigation,"" Grassley's office said in a statement Thursday.

""If the FBI had sufficient information regarding counterintelligence concerns to authorize these investigative activities, then it is important to understand whether it took steps to provide a defensive briefing or otherwise warn the candidate before the election.""

Grassley, in his letter to Wray, noted that the FBI apparently warned McCain's campaign about Manafort's possible ties to Russia during the 2008 presidential race because one of McCain's top campaign advisers, Rick Davis, was Manafort's business partner at the time.

""The concerns allegedly involved work performed by Mr. Manafort and his business partner at the time, Rick Davis, on behalf of Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych, who was backed by (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,"" Grassley wrote.

Davis and Manafort also had reportedly arranged for Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska to meet McCain twice, Grassley said. Manafort offered to provide Deripaska, who has ties to the Kremlin, with briefings on last year's presidential election, according to reports by The Washington Post.

""According to John Weaver, a former top campaign advisor to Senator McCain: 'My sense is that Davis and Manafort, who were already doing pro-Putin work against American national interests, were using potential meetings with McCain — who didn't know this and neither did we until after the fact — as bait to secure more rubles from the oligarchs,'"" Grassley wrote.

But Tarallo disputed that description of events.

""Senator McCain had two interactions with Mr. Deripaska in 2006, and both were social occasions and entirely incidental,"" she said.

Grassley said warnings from the FBI to political campaigns allow ""innocent, unwitting organizations and individuals to take defensive action to protect themselves.""

If Trump's campaign was warned, then the FBI needs to make that clear so that campaign officials can be questioned about how they responded, Grassley said.

While Grassley seemed to be challenging Wray about the FBI's actions, McCain defended the Intelligence Community, including special counsel Robert Mueller, a former FBI director who is conducting a criminal probe that includes looking into allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.

""Senator McCain has high confidence in Special Counsel Mueller and our intelligence agencies, and trusts they will follow all of the facts surrounding Russia’s brazen attack on our election wherever they lead,"" Tarallo said.

U.S. House Republicans are drafting a contempt of Congress resolution against Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray, claiming stonewalling in producing material related to the Russia-Trump probes and other matters.

Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes and other committee Republicans, after considering such action for several weeks, decided to move after media including the New York Times reported Saturday on why a top FBI official assigned to Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of Russia-Trump election collusion had been removed from the investigation.

Republicans, including the president, pointed to the reports as evidence that the entire probe into Russian meddling has been politically motivated.

“Now it all starts to make sense,” Trump said on Twitter Sunday.

In his statement Saturday, Nunes pointed to the reports that the official, Peter Strzok, was removed after allegedly having exchanged anti-Trump and pro-Hillary Clinton text messages with his mistress, who was an FBI lawyer working for Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe.

Another Trump tweet referred to the agent as “tainted (no, very dishonest?).” The president added that the FBI’s reputation “is in Tatters - worst in History!” In a busy morning of notes to his 44 million followers, Trump earlier said that “I never asked” former FBI Director James Comey “to stop investigating Flynn. Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie!”

Agent’s Dismissal

Until now, Nunes said, the FBI and Department of Justice have failed to sufficiently comply with an Aug. 24 committee subpoena -- including by refusing repeated demands “for an explanation of Peter Strzok’s dismissal from the Mueller probe.”

“In light of today’s press reports, we now know why Strzok was dismissed, why the FBI and DOJ refused to provide us this explanation, and at least one reason why they previously refused to make Deputy Director McCabe available to the Committee for an interview,” Nunes said.

“By hiding from Congress, and from the American people, documented political bias by a key FBI head investigator for both the Russia collusion probe and the Clinton email investigation, the FBI and DOJ engaged in a willful attempt to thwart Congress’ constitutional oversight responsibility,” he said.

‘Fully Met’

Nunes, in the statement, said the committee will move on a resolution by the end of the month unless it demands are “fully met” by the close of business Dec. 4.

He cited “a months-long pattern by the DOJ and FBI of stonewalling and obstructing this Committee’s oversight work,” including also withholding subpoenaed information about their use of an opposition research dossier that targeted Trump in the 2016 election.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions would not be a target of any contempt action by the committee, Nunes has said, because he recused himself from any investigation into charges that Russia meddled in the election.

Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said in an email that “we disagree with the chairman’s characterization and will continue to work with congressional committees to provide the information they request consistent with our national security responsibilities.”

Documents and Briefings

The department has already provided members of House leadership and the Intelligence Committee with “several hundred pages of classified documents” and multiple briefings -- including whether any FBI payments were made related to the dossier -- and has cleared witnesses including McCabe and Strzok to testify, she said.

The House committee’s top Democrat, Representative Adam Schiff of California, responded in a statement that the Department of Justice inspector general is “properly investigating the handling of the investigation, including the current allegation of bias” by Strzok.

“I am concerned, however, that our chairman is willing to use the subpoena and contempt power of the House, not to determine how the Russians interfered in our election or whether the president obstructed Justice, but only to distract from the core of our investigation,” Schiff said.

Salacious Allegations

The dossier, which included salacious allegations about Trump, was paid for in part by the Democratic National Committee and Clinton through a law firm. Nunes and other committee Republicans -- backed by Speaker Paul Ryan -- say they want to investigate whether the Justice Department and FBI may have improperly relied on the dossier to kick-start federal surveillance that caught up Trump associates, without independently confirming the information they used to justify such spying.

“The DOJ has now expressed -- on a Saturday, just hours after the press reports on Strzok’s dismissal appeared -- sudden willingness to comply with some of the Committee’s long-standing demands,” Nunes said. “This attempted 11th-hour accommodation is neither credible nor believable, and in fact is yet another example of the DOJ’s disingenuousness and obstruction.”

Those agencies “should be investigating themselves,” he said.

Comity Strained

If Nunes and Republicans do follow through with the contempt action, it would be a latest blow against bipartisanship on a committee that had until recently been one of the last bastions of comity in a polarized House. Democrats complain Republicans are increasingly shifting attention and limited resources in the Russian investigation away from a main focus of election interference and potential Trump campaign collusion.

The committee’s infighting has stepped up since October, coinciding with Democratic complaints that Nunes has returned to a more active capacity for Republicans in the committee’s Russia investigation.

Nunes said April 6 he was stepping back amid criticism of his handling of classified material, reportedly obtained from White House officials, that he said showed officials of former President Barack Obama’s administration “unmasked” the identities of people close to Trump who were mentioned in legal surveillance of foreign individuals.

If the report released Monday by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz constitutes a “ clearing ” of the FBI , never clear me of anything . Holy God , what a clown show the Trump-Russia investigation was .
Like the much-ballyhooed report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller , the Horowitz report is a Rorschach test , in which partisans will find what they want to find .
Much of the press is concentrating on Horowitz ’ s conclusion that there was no evidence of “ political bias or improper motivation ” in the FBI ’ s probe of Donald Trump ’ s Russia contacts , an investigation Horowitz says the bureau had “ authorized purpose ” to conduct .
Horowitz uses phrases like “ serious performance failures , ” describing his 416-page catalogue of errors and manipulations as incompetence rather than corruption . This throws water on the notion that the Trump investigation was a vast frame-up .
However , Horowitz describes at great length an FBI whose “ serious ” procedural problems and omissions of “ significant information ” in pursuit of surveillance authority all fell in the direction of expanding the unprecedented investigation of a presidential candidate ( later , a president ) .
Officials on the “ Crossfire Hurricane ” Trump-Russia investigators went to extraordinary , almost comical lengths to seek surveillance authority of figures like Trump aide Carter Page . In one episode , an FBI attorney inserted the words “ not a source ” in an email he ’ d received from another government agency . This disguised the fact that Page had been an informant for that agency , and had dutifully told the government in real time about being approached by Russian intelligence . The attorney then passed on the email to an FBI supervisory special agent , who signed a FISA warrant application on Page that held those Russian contacts against Page , without disclosing his informant role .
Likewise , the use of reports by ex-spy/campaign researcher Christopher Steele in pursuit of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) authority had far-reaching ramifications .
Not only did obtaining a FISA warrant allow authorities a window into other Trump figures with whom Page communicated , they led to a slew of leaked “ bombshell ” news stories that advanced many public misconceptions , including that a court had ruled there was “ probable cause ” that a Trump figure was an “ agent of a foreign power . ”
There are too many to list in one column , but the Horowitz report show years of breathless headlines were wrong . Some key points :
The so-called “ Steele dossier ” was , actually , crucial to the FBI ’ s decision to seek secret surveillance of Page .
Press figures have derided the idea that Steele was crucial to the FISA application , with some insisting it was only a “ small part ” of the application . Horowitz is clear :
We determined that the Crossfire Hurricane team ’ s receipt of Steele ’ s election reporting on September 19 , 2016 played a central and essential role in the FBI ’ s and Department ’ s decision to seek the FISA order .
The report describes how , prior to receiving Steele ’ s reports , the FBI General Counsel ( OGC ) and/or the National Security Division ’ s Office of Intelligence ( OI ) wouldn ’ t budge on seeking FISA authority . But after getting the reports , the OGC unit chief said , “ receipt of the Steele reporting changed her mind on whether they could establish probable cause . ”
Meanwhile , the OI unit chief said Steele ’ s reports were “ what kind of pushed it over the line. ” There ’ s no FISA warrant without Steele .
Democrats are not going to want to hear this , since conventional wisdom says former House Intelligence chief Devin Nunes is a conspiratorial evildoer , but the Horowitz report ratifies the major claims of the infamous “ Nunes memo . ”
As noted , Horowitz establishes that the Steele report was crucial to the FISA process , even using the same language Nunes used ( “ essential ” ) . He also confirms the Nunes assertion that the FBI double-dipped in citing both Steele and a September 23 , 2016 Yahoo ! news story using Steele as an unnamed source . Horowitz listed the idea that Steele did not directly provide information to the press as one of seven significant “ inaccuracies or omissions ” in the first FISA application .
Horowitz also verifies the claim that Steele was “ closed for cause ” for talking to the media , i.e . officially cut off as a confidential human source to the FBI . He shows that Steele continued to talk to Justice Official Bruce Ohr before and after Steele ’ s formal relationship with the FBI ended . His report confirms that the Steele information had not been corroborated when the FISA application was submitted , another key Nunes point .
There was gnashing of teeth when Nunes first released his memo in January , 2018 . The press universally crapped on his letter , with a Washington Post piece calling it a “ joke ” and a “ sham. ” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slammed Nunes for the release of a “ bogus ” document , while New York Senator Chuck Schumer said the memo was intended to “ sow conspiracy theories and attack the integrity of federal law enforcement. ” Many called for his removal as Committee chair .
The Horowitz report says all of that caterwauling was off-base . It also undercuts many of the assertions made in a ballyhooed response letter by Nunes counterpart Adam Schiff , who described the FBI ’ s “ reasonable basis ” for deeming Steele credible . The report is especially hostile to Schiff ’ s claim that the FBI “ provided additional information obtained through multiple independent sources that corroborated Steele ’ s reporting . ”
In fact , far from confirming the Steele material , the FBI over time seems mainly to have uncovered more and more reasons to run screaming from Steele , to wit :
The “ Steele dossier ” was “ Internet rumor , ” and corroboration for the pee tape story was “ zero . ”
The Steele report reads like a pile of rumors surrounded by public information pulled off the Internet , and the Horowitz report does nothing to dispel this notion .
At the time the FBI submitted its first FISA application , Horowitz writes , it had “ corroborated limited information in Steele ’ s election reporting , and most of that was publicly available information. ” Horowitz says of Steele ’ s reports : “ The CIA viewed it as ‘ internet rumor . ’ ”
Worse ( and this part of the story should be tattooed on the heads of Russia truthers ) , the FBI ’ s interviews of Steele ’ s sources revealed Steele embellished the most explosive parts of his report .
The “ pee tape ” story , which inspired countless grave headlines ( see this chin-scratching New York Times history of Russian “ sexual blackmail ” ) and plunged the Trump presidency into crisis before it began , was , this source said , based a “ conversation that [ he/she ] had over beers , ” with the sexual allegations made… in “ jest ” !
Steele in his report said the story had been “ confirmed ” by senior , Western hotel staff , but the actual source said it was all “ rumor and speculation , ” never confirmed . In fact , charged by Steele to find corroboration , the source could not : corroboration was “ zero , ” writes Horowitz .

No matter what people think the political meaning of the Horowitz report might be , reporters who read it will know : Anybody who touched this nonsense in print should be embarrassed .","The Guardian headline reads: “DOJ Internal watchdog report clears FBI of illegal surveillance of Trump adviser.”

If the report released Monday by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz constitutes a “clearing” of the FBI, never clear me of anything. Holy God, what a clown show the Trump-Russia investigation was.

Like the much-ballyhooed report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, the Horowitz report is a Rorschach test, in which partisans will find what they want to find.

Much of the press is concentrating on Horowitz’s conclusion that there was no evidence of “political bias or improper motivation” in the FBI’s probe of Donald Trump’s Russia contacts, an investigation Horowitz says the bureau had “authorized purpose” to conduct.

Horowitz uses phrases like “serious performance failures,” describing his 416-page catalogue of errors and manipulations as incompetence rather than corruption. This throws water on the notion that the Trump investigation was a vast frame-up.

However, Horowitz describes at great length an FBI whose “serious” procedural problems and omissions of “significant information” in pursuit of surveillance authority all fell in the direction of expanding the unprecedented investigation of a presidential candidate (later, a president).

Officials on the “Crossfire Hurricane” Trump-Russia investigators went to extraordinary, almost comical lengths to seek surveillance authority of figures like Trump aide Carter Page. In one episode, an FBI attorney inserted the words “not a source” in an email he’d received from another government agency. This disguised the fact that Page had been an informant for that agency, and had dutifully told the government in real time about being approached by Russian intelligence. The attorney then passed on the email to an FBI supervisory special agent, who signed a FISA warrant application on Page that held those Russian contacts against Page, without disclosing his informant role.

Likewise, the use of reports by ex-spy/campaign researcher Christopher Steele in pursuit of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) authority had far-reaching ramifications.

Not only did obtaining a FISA warrant allow authorities a window into other Trump figures with whom Page communicated, they led to a slew of leaked “bombshell” news stories that advanced many public misconceptions, including that a court had ruled there was “probable cause” that a Trump figure was an “agent of a foreign power.”

There are too many to list in one column, but the Horowitz report show years of breathless headlines were wrong. Some key points:

The so-called “Steele dossier” was, actually, crucial to the FBI’s decision to seek secret surveillance of Page.

Press figures have derided the idea that Steele was crucial to the FISA application, with some insisting it was only a “small part” of the application. Horowitz is clear:

We determined that the Crossfire Hurricane team’s receipt of Steele’s election reporting on September 19, 2016 played a central and essential role in the FBI’s and Department’s decision to seek the FISA order.

The report describes how, prior to receiving Steele’s reports, the FBI General Counsel (OGC) and/or the National Security Division’s Office of Intelligence (OI) wouldn’t budge on seeking FISA authority. But after getting the reports, the OGC unit chief said, “receipt of the Steele reporting changed her mind on whether they could establish probable cause.”

Meanwhile, the OI unit chief said Steele’s reports were “what kind of pushed it over the line.” There’s no FISA warrant without Steele.

Horowitz ratifies the oft-denounced “Nunes memo.”

Democrats are not going to want to hear this, since conventional wisdom says former House Intelligence chief Devin Nunes is a conspiratorial evildoer, but the Horowitz report ratifies the major claims of the infamous “Nunes memo.”

As noted, Horowitz establishes that the Steele report was crucial to the FISA process, even using the same language Nunes used (“essential”). He also confirms the Nunes assertion that the FBI double-dipped in citing both Steele and a September 23, 2016 Yahoo! news story using Steele as an unnamed source. Horowitz listed the idea that Steele did not directly provide information to the press as one of seven significant “inaccuracies or omissions” in the first FISA application.

Horowitz also verifies the claim that Steele was “closed for cause” for talking to the media, i.e. officially cut off as a confidential human source to the FBI. He shows that Steele continued to talk to Justice Official Bruce Ohr before and after Steele’s formal relationship with the FBI ended. His report confirms that the Steele information had not been corroborated when the FISA application was submitted, another key Nunes point.

There was gnashing of teeth when Nunes first released his memo in January, 2018. The press universally crapped on his letter, with a Washington Post piece calling it a “joke” and a “sham.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slammed Nunes for the release of a “bogus” document, while New York Senator Chuck Schumer said the memo was intended to “sow conspiracy theories and attack the integrity of federal law enforcement.” Many called for his removal as Committee chair.

The Horowitz report says all of that caterwauling was off-base. It also undercuts many of the assertions made in a ballyhooed response letter by Nunes counterpart Adam Schiff, who described the FBI’s “reasonable basis” for deeming Steele credible. The report is especially hostile to Schiff’s claim that the FBI “provided additional information obtained through multiple independent sources that corroborated Steele’s reporting.”

In fact, far from confirming the Steele material, the FBI over time seems mainly to have uncovered more and more reasons to run screaming from Steele, to wit:

The “Steele dossier” was “Internet rumor,” and corroboration for the pee tape story was “zero.”

The Steele report reads like a pile of rumors surrounded by public information pulled off the Internet, and the Horowitz report does nothing to dispel this notion.

At the time the FBI submitted its first FISA application, Horowitz writes, it had “corroborated limited information in Steele’s election reporting, and most of that was publicly available information.” Horowitz says of Steele’s reports: “The CIA viewed it as ‘internet rumor.’”

Worse (and this part of the story should be tattooed on the heads of Russia truthers), the FBI’s interviews of Steele’s sources revealed Steele embellished the most explosive parts of his report.

The “pee tape” story, which inspired countless grave headlines (see this chin-scratching New York Times history of Russian “sexual blackmail”) and plunged the Trump presidency into crisis before it began, was, this source said, based a “conversation that [he/she] had over beers,” with the sexual allegations made… in “jest”!

Steele in his report said the story had been “confirmed” by senior, Western hotel staff, but the actual source said it was all “rumor and speculation,” never confirmed. In fact, charged by Steele to find corroboration, the source could not: corroboration was “zero,” writes Horowitz.

Meanwhile the Steele assertions that Russians had a kompromat file on Hillary Clinton, and that there was a “well-developed conspiracy of coordination” between the Trump campaign and Russians, relied on a source Steele himself disparaged as an “egoist” and “boaster” who “may engage in some embellishment.” This was known to the FBI at the start, yet they naturally failed to include this info in the warrant application, one of what Horowitz described as “17 significant errors or omissions” in the FISA application.

Finally, when the FBI conducted an investigation into Steele’s “work-related performance,” they heard from some that he was “smart,” and a “person of integrity,” and “if he reported it, he believed it.”

So far, so good. But Horowitz also wrote:

Their notes stated: “[d]emonstrates lack of self-awareness, poor judgment;” “[k]een to help” but “underpinned by poor judgment;” “Judgment: pursuing people with political risk but no intel value;” “[d]idn’t always exercise great judgment- sometimes [he] believes he knows best;” and “[r]eporting in good faith, but not clear what he would have done to validate.”

The Crossfire Hurricane team got all of this, but, again, didn’t pass it upstairs or include any of it in its warrant application.

I’ve written about how reporters used sleight of hand to get the Steele dossier into print without putting it through a vetting process. What Horowitz describes is worse: a story about bad journalism piled on bad journalism, balanced on a third layer of wrong reporting.

Steele in his “reports” embellished his sources’ quotes, played up nonexistent angles, invented attributions, and ignored inconsistencies. The FBI then transplanted this bad reporting in the form of a warrant application and an addendum to the Intelligence Assessment that included the Steele material, ignoring a new layer of inconsistencies and red flags its analysts uncovered in the review process.

Then, following a series of leaks, the news media essentially reported on the FBI’s wrong reporting of Steele’s wrong reporting.

The impact was greater than just securing a warrant to monitor Page. More significant were the years of headlines that grew out of this process, beginning with the leaking of the meeting with Trump about Steele’s blackmail allegations, the insertion of Steele’s conclusions in the Intelligence Assessment about Russian interference, and the leak of news about the approval of the Page FISA warrant.

As a result, a “well-developed conspiracy” theory based on a report that Comey described as “salacious and unverified material that a responsible journalist wouldn’t report without corroborating,” became the driving news story in a superpower nation for two years. Even the New York Times, which published a lot of these stories, is in the wake of the Horowitz report noting Steele’s role in “unleashing a flood of speculation in the news media about the new president’s relationship with Russia.”

Like government agencies and political parties, the character and quality of the press matters enormously to the health of public discourse and, consequently, the health of democratic institutions.

Another big tranche of missing communications? Really?

When the IRS was in trouble for targeting tea-party organizations and other conservative groups in the run-up to the 2012 election, thousands of emails — evidence under subpoena — went missing. John Koskinen, then acting commissioner of the IRS, lied to Congress about how and why that happened, a fact he was later forced to acknowledge.

The two exchanged politically charged messages about Trump and the Clinton email investigation, and Strzok wrote darkly of developing an “insurance policy” against Trump’s election, still regarded as highly unlikely at that time.

The texts went missing, and then were recovered. Or some of them were recovered. All of them? Whose word would you take on that? And why would you take the FBI’s word? Aaron Blake, writing in the Washington Post, argued that the “insurance policy” message looked bad, but not as bad as some on Trump’s side insisted. Well. He allowed that “it’s 100 percent true Mueller and his probe aren’t above reproach.”

And that, of course, is really what this is all about.

“Above reproach” does not mean “never made a mistake,” “never got it wrong,” “never had a rogue employee misbehave.” No, “above reproach,” in this context, means that the institution behaved and responded institutionally in a way consistent with its duties, its mission, and its public purpose. That means, among other things, acknowledging forthrightly when bad actors within the agency abuse their offices and their powers for political purposes and tilt the table toward their political friends and benefactors. That means treating such situations with complete and total transparency.

It means, at the very least, not destroying evidence in a federal investigation. And no sane person believes for a nanosecond that those “lost” communications represent anything other than willful obstruction of justice. If you are on the FBI’s radar and you got a parking ticket in Sheboygan in 1983, the FBI knows whether you paid it. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is a federal bureau in the business of conducting investigations.

No one believes that the IRS or the FBI is above reproach. No one seriously believes that the editors of the New York Times would have treated a President Hillary Clinton and a President Donald Trump in the same way. (One likewise wonders what Fox News would have made of partially documented claims that President Bill Clinton had paid $130,000 in hush money to a porn star who says she had an affair with him.) President Obama’s so-called scandal-free administration was in fact rife with abuses of power, from the IRS to the ATF to the EPA to the NLRB. Trump may sometimes attack our institutions without good cause; the Obama administration gave critics good cause to attack our institutions.

We have not yet reached the point of no return, but the diminishing faith in our institutions — the media, the government, law enforcement, the universities, and more — is not the result of Donald Trump’s wounded egomania or talk-radio screeds against the mainstream media and the “deep state.” (Some of those are amusingly daft: Sean Hannity lamented that the mainstream media was sure to ignore a certain story while he was reading aloud on the radio the text of an Associated Press report about that very story — which of course is how he knew about it in the first place.) Yes, conspiracy theories are to be resisted and ridiculed, and the institutions that make possible our free society are to be cherished. But they need not be cherished blindly. In fact, it is essential that we do the opposite, that we keep them under close and aggressive oversight — conducted both by government institutions and by the press — and that we weed out corruption, self-dealing, and political abuses where we find them.

Devin Nunes ( R-Calif. ) , chairman of the House Intelligence Committee , has instructed his staff to draw up a contempt of Congress citation for FBI Director Christopher Wray and his deputy , Rod Rosenstein , after it was revealed Saturday that a top FBI agent was removed from the Trump-Russia investigation for possible anti-Trump bias .
The New York Times and Washington Post both reported Saturday FBI special agent Peter Strzok — who played key roles in the FBI 's initial Russia investigation , special counsel Robert Mueller 's investigation and the Clinton email investigation — was removed from Mueller 's investigation after it was discovered he exchanged anti-Trump text messages with FBI lawyer Lisa Page , whom he was having an extramarital affair with . Strzok was re-assigned to the FBI 's human resources department , a move many saw as a demotion .
The Post reported that Strzok and Page exchanged texts that were anti-Trump and pro-Clinton . The messages themselves were n't revealed , just the existence of them .
As part of the intelligence committee 's investigation into the Trump-Russia probe and the anti-Trump dossier , Nunes asked the Justice Department several times why Strzok had been removed from the investigation , according to the Washington Examiner . The committee even issued a subpoena on Aug. 24 requesting information on Strzok 's reassignment .
Nunes and his committee followed up five separate times between Oct. 11 and Dec. 1 . Each time , however , the DOJ and FBI refused to answer the committee 's questions .

''
Nunes said the contempt of Congress citation will be drawn up before the end of December unless Wray and Rosenstein make every effort to honor the intelligence committee 's requests .","Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has instructed his staff to draw up a contempt of Congress citation for FBI Director Christopher Wray and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, after it was revealed Saturday that a top FBI agent was removed from the Trump-Russia investigation for possible anti-Trump bias.

What happened?

The New York Times and Washington Post both reported Saturday FBI special agent Peter Strzok — who played key roles in the FBI's initial Russia investigation, special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation and the Clinton email investigation — was removed from Mueller's investigation after it was discovered he exchanged anti-Trump text messages with FBI lawyer Lisa Page, whom he was having an extramarital affair with. Strzok was re-assigned to the FBI's human resources department, a move many saw as a demotion.

The Post reported that Strzok and Page exchanged texts that were anti-Trump and pro-Clinton. The messages themselves weren't revealed, just the existence of them.

As part of the intelligence committee's investigation into the Trump-Russia probe and the anti-Trump dossier, Nunes asked the Justice Department several times why Strzok had been removed from the investigation, according to the Washington Examiner. The committee even issued a subpoena on Aug. 24 requesting information on Strzok's reassignment.

Nunes and his committee followed up five separate times between Oct. 11 and Dec. 1. Each time, however, the DOJ and FBI refused to answer the committee's questions. It was only after the Times and Post stories hit the presses that the DOJ informed Nunes they would grant his requests — well, at least some of them.

The actions of the DOJ have left Nunes and his committee no other option, the California Republican said Saturday.

What did he say?

He said, according to the Examiner:

By hiding from Congress, and from the American people, documented political bias by a key FBI head investigator for both the Russia collusion probe and the Clinton email investigation, the FBI and DOJ engaged in a willful attempt to thwart Congress' constitutional oversight responsibility. This is part of a months-long pattern by the DOJ and FBI of stonewalling and obstructing this committee's oversight work, particularly oversight of their use of the Steele dossier. At this point, these agencies should be investigating themselves.

Nunes then went on to criticize the agency for its ""sudden willingness to comply"" with the committee's demands.

""The DOJ has now expressed — on a Saturday, just hours after the press reports on Strzok's dismissal appeared — a sudden willingness to comply with some of the committee's long-standing demands,"" Nunes said. ""This attempted 11th-hour accommodation is neither credible nor believable, and in fact is yet another example of the DOJ's disingenuousness and obstruction.""

Nunes said the contempt of Congress citation will be drawn up before the end of December unless Wray and Rosenstein make every effort to honor the intelligence committee's requests.",www.theblaze.com,right,tV78jLPUIY8yFMQe

In fact , I would think all weasels everywhere are deeply offended to even be mentioned in the same breath with the preening , sanctimonious , duplicitous , crooked ex-FBI director .
As an example of his overbearing weaselhood , consider that he was tweeting that the report clears him . Really ?
Let me summarize the 80-plus pages for you by pulling out some quotes :
“ Violated Department and FBI policies . … Comey Improperly Disclosed … Comey ’ s Improper Disclosures… Comey ’ s characterization finds no support in the law and is wholly incompatible with the plain language of the statutes , regulations and policies defining federal records , and the terms of Comey ’ s FBI Employment Agreement . … Comey violated … this assertion is without legal basis . … Unauthorized disclosure … Former Director Comey failed to live up to this responsibility … a dangerous example … .. ”
But the alt-left media will claim that because the Justice Department declined to indict this obviously corrupt cop , he is “ exonerated. ” Got that ?

( Check out Howie ’ s new podcast about the Bulgers at dirtyratspodcast.com . )","James Comey has said repeatedly he is not a weasel, but the Inspector General’s new report says otherwise.

In fact, I would think all weasels everywhere are deeply offended to even be mentioned in the same breath with the preening, sanctimonious, duplicitous, crooked ex-FBI director.

As an example of his overbearing weaselhood, consider that he was tweeting that the report clears him. Really?

Let me summarize the 80-plus pages for you by pulling out some quotes:

“Violated Department and FBI policies. … Comey Improperly Disclosed … Comey’s Improper Disclosures… Comey’s characterization finds no support in the law and is wholly incompatible with the plain language of the statutes, regulations and policies defining federal records, and the terms of Comey’s FBI Employment Agreement. … Comey violated … this assertion is without legal basis. … Unauthorized disclosure … Former Director Comey failed to live up to this responsibility … a dangerous example …..”

And so on.

But the alt-left media will claim that because the Justice Department declined to indict this obviously corrupt cop, he is “exonerated.” Got that?

Comey is a Democrat, the worst of the worst type of prevaricating, back-stabbing swamp creature, so no indictment means “exoneration.” On the other hand, Trump did nothing except being framed for something he didn’t do, but the 13 angry Democrats on the special counsel’s staff continue to assert that no indictment doesn’t mean Trump is “exonerated.”

Actually, the violations of myriad laws and Justice Department regulations are the least damning part of the report. This guy Comey is such a double dealer, it reminds everyone of why the reputation of FBI is in tatters, not just here in Boston, but now across the nation.

Here’s a money quote on Page 60:

“Comey said he was compelled to take these actions ‘if I love this country… and I love the Department of Justice, and I love the FBI.”

To paraphrase that officer in Vietnam who burned down the village, Comey had to destroy the FBI in order to save it.

Of course I’m disappointed that he won’t be doing the perp walk anytime soon, but the Inspector General did a good job summing up the fallacies of Comey’s self-bestowed above-the-law status.

“Were current or former FBI employees to follow the former Director’s example and disclose sensitive information in service of their own strongly held personal convicitons, the FBI would be unable to dispatch its law enforcement duties properly.”

Which this pompous fraud — “James Cardinal Comey,” as Rudy Giuliani calls him — himself acknowledged in his Congressional testimony, as the IG noted. How can the FBI do its work, he pontificated, “if people run around telling the press what we do.”

After which he ran to his limo and then dictated a memo to be leaked to the press.

I’m telling you, the more I go over this report, the more I think weasels may have a class-action suit against this guy.

You know the basics of what happened: Trump didn’t trust him, for obvious reasons. He tells Trump about Hillary Clinton’s fake dossier that he used to surveil the campaign, then 10 minutes later it leaks to fake-news CNN, which treats it like it’s true.

On Feb. 14, 2017, Trump complains about the continuing leaks from the Russian collusion hoax and Comey tells him, “leaks … were terrible and a serious violation of the law.” (Page 74).

Then he writes a memo about his conversation and … leaks it to the press.

Only of course he doesn’t leak it himself. He gives it to a coatholder on his payroll, then claims the coffee boy is his lawyer, so he can claim attorney-client privilege. Then he instructs his “lawyer” to read the memo to some from the Democrat steno pool at The New York Times, but not show it to him, just read it.

It’s called CYA. On a much smaller scale, I’ve been involved in such sneaky stuff myself. But it never occurred to me (or any of my sources) to claim that we are acting in anything other than our own self-interest.

At one point (page 22) even Comey admits the obvious, when the IG asks him why he’s writing all these CYA memos and then leaking them. He admits he did it “for me. Also for the FBI. But honestly, at this point, I was thinking first about me, close second the FBI.”

No, not a close second. Not even a distant second. For Comey, it’s all about him. If they ever name a street after him, it’ll have to be one-way.

The Wall Street Journal put out this new report tonight days after the paper reported that the FBI investigation may have been shut down completely by the DOJ .
First off , there was apparently quite a bit of disagreement as to which side of this the number two person at the FBI and U.S. attorney Robert Capers were on :
Amid the internal finger-pointing on the Clinton Foundation matter , some have blamed the FBI ’ s No . 2 official , deputy director Andrew McCabe , claiming he sought to stop agents from pursuing the case this summer .

The FBI reportedly started to look into the foundation after the release of the book Clinton Cash : The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich by Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Peter Schweitzer .
Schweitzer was interviewed by the FBI , but it was another interview they conducted that led to some questions being raised about whether they had a case :
The FBI had secretly recorded conversations of a suspect in a public-corruption case talking about alleged deals the Clintons made , these people said . The agents listening to the recordings couldn ’ t tell from the conversations if what the suspect was describing was accurate , but it was , they thought , worth checking out .

In preparation for his testimony to Congress , `` Cohen 's message had several components , '' according to notes of his FBI interview . `` COHEN has to keep TRUMP out of the messaging related to Russia and keep TRUMP out of the Russia conversation . '' He also told investigators that any false testimony was `` not his idea . ''
Cohen told Congress in February , “ In his way , he was telling me to lie , ” about concealing negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow . Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to lying to Congress about when discussions related to the Trump Tower Moscow deal had ended .
Cohen also `` learned the message to have the Russia investigations end early from discussions with TRUMP , SEKULOW '' and a third person whose name is redacted . Relevant document on page 74 :
Gates said the Trump campaign was `` very happy '' about the release of hacked DNC emails Gates , who served as Trump ’ s deputy campaign chair , told Mueller ’ s team in late 2018 that the release of the hacked emails “ offered a mode of deflection for the campaign after a sink in polling numbers following Trump 's comments about Ted Cruz 's father at the end of the Republican National Convention . ”
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said in June 2016 that the group had an upcoming email leak related to Hillary Clinton . After that , Manafort instructed Gates to “ periodically call ” someone whose name is redacted from the documents “ to check in on where the information was and when it would be coming , ” Gates told the FBI . “ Trump was generally frustrated Clinton 's missing emails had not been found , ” Gates also told investigators .
After the hacked DNC emails , Trump told Gates that `` more leaks were coming '' Shortly after the Democratic National Convention in 2016 — which came right after Russian hackers stole DNC emails , throwing the party into disarray — Trump and Gates , a top campaign aide , were riding in a car from Trump Tower in Manhattan to LaGuardia Airport . Trump told Gates that `` more leaks were coming . '' When it came to the Trump campaign conspiring with Russia to influence the election , Mueller 's report , released in April , found that no charges were warranted , but that there is still information he did not know . “ While the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign , ” Mueller wrote about a conspiracy with Russia , “ the evidence was not sufficient to support criminal charges. ” Relevant document on page 42 :
Bannon told the FBI that Jared Kushner vacationed with a Russian oligarch Bannon told FBI investigators that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner were on vacation in Croatia with a “ Russian billionaire ” in August 2016 — appearing to confirm a long-suspected and long-denied connection between Trump world and a Russian oligarch .
Messages between Bannon and an unnamed individual with a Breitbart domain email address — exchanged in July 2017 , one month before Bannon was fired from his position as White House chief strategist — revealed that they were hoping to leverage this information against Kushner . Bannon cofounded the far-right Breitbart and rejoined it in August 2017 . The messages and information were documented as part of an interview with then–special counsel Robert Mueller ’ s investigators , and were revealed by ███ for the first time Saturday . Representatives for Kushner and Ivanka Trump didn ’ t immediately return requests for comment . In a Feb. 14 , 2018 , interview with the special counsel ’ s office , Bannon said that Kushner had been on vacation with a Russian oligarch when he took over the Trump campaign in August 2016 . In the documents released Saturday , Bannon told investigators that Kushner had been in Croatia with the unnamed Russian billionaire , Rupert Murdoch ’ s ex-wife Wendi Deng , and the Russian ’ s girlfriend , whom Bannon said his sources in the intelligence community found to be “ questionable. ” Relevant document on page 109 :
Kushner and his family ’ s Croatian vacation in August 2016 was widely covered in the media . Throughout the trip , Deng was photographed with Kushner and his wife , Ivanka , who also shared a picture of herself and Deng in Dubrovnik on her Instagram account .
Deng didn ’ t immediately return a request for comment . Bannon referenced Kushner ’ s vacation in an email dated July 24 , 2017 , to an individual with a Breitbart domain email address whose name has been redacted . Bannon appeared to indicate that the information , if reported and confirmed , could be valuable against Kushner , his rival for power in the Trump administration . “ He was on ‘ vacation ’ off the coast of Croatia with a Russian billionaire when I took over the campaign , ” Bannon wrote .
“ How do we prove that ? ” The unnamed person replied . “ That ’ s game set match. ” Relevant document on page 178 :
The same day as these emails , Bannon exchanged messages with someone at Breitbart about a Guardian story reporting that Kushner secured a real estate deal with another Soviet-born oligarch .
“ Don ’ t touch yet , ” Bannon said . “ k this is big though isn ’ t it ? It ’ s the ball game… ” the Breitbart person responded . “ All and everything , ” Bannon replied . Relevant document on page 179 :
Manafort was advising the Trump campaign up until days before the election Bannon ’ s emails show that Manafort was still advising the Trump campaign three days before the Nov. 8 , 2016 election — despite having been fired in August — and said the campaign needed to hide that fact . Manafort emailed Kushner on Nov. 5 and wrote that he was “ feeling really good about our prospects on Tuesday. ” He said that he was focused “ on preserving the victory ” and had sent Kushner “ a memo deal [ ing ] with this concern. ” Manafort wrote that he had sent the memo to Reince Priebus , the former chair of the Republican National Committee and Trump 's former chief of staff , and “ briefed Rick Gates and Hannity. ” Kushner forwarded the email to Bannon the same day and asked him what he thought . “ We need to avoid this guy like the plague , ” Bannon said in an email to Kushner dated Nov. 5 . “ Paul is nice guy but can ’ t let word get out he is advising us. ” “ They are going to try to say the Russians worked with wiki leaks to give this victory to us. ” Relevant document on page 238 :

He was urging Russian hackers to work to find emails belonging to his opponent , Hillary Clinton . Gates also said that he recalled `` staff meeting conversations about 'someone out there has to have the missing emails . ' ''
A Trump associate sent Bannon a bizarre debate tactic Trump supporter and associate Ted Malloch emailed Bannon before the first debate and said Trump should start by handing Hillary Clinton a `` Writ of Indictment . ''
Trump and his associates by that time had led `` lock her up '' chants at his rallies at the Republican National Convention . And he told Clinton during the second debate she 'd `` be in jail '' if he became president over her email controversy . Relevant document on page 230 :

But Trump made it a major campaign pledge .

The documents revealed Saturday, known as “302 reports,” are summaries of interviews with former White House official and Trump campaign manager Stephen Bannon, Cohen, Gates, and more. They are some of the most important and highly sought-after documents from Mueller’s investigation. They reveal what key players in the campaign told FBI agents about Russia, Trump, the email hack during the 2016 presidential campaign, and Trump's associates’ handling of the special counsel’s investigation. Mueller’s 448-page report released last April was the most hotly anticipated prosecutorial document in a generation, laying out the evidence of Russia's interference in the 2016 election and the Trump administration’s efforts to obstruct the inquiry. The report, however, reflected only a small fraction of the billions of primary-source documents that the government claims Mueller’s team may have amassed over the course of its two-year investigation.

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said in June 2016 that the group had an upcoming email leak related to Hillary Clinton. After that, Manafort instructed Gates to “periodically call” someone whose name is redacted from the documents “to check in on where the information was and when it would be coming,” Gates told the FBI. “Trump was generally frustrated Clinton's missing emails had not been found,” Gates also told investigators.

After the hacked DNC emails, Trump told Gates that ""more leaks were coming"" Shortly after the Democratic National Convention in 2016 — which came right after Russian hackers stole DNC emails, throwing the party into disarray — Trump and Gates, a top campaign aide, were riding in a car from Trump Tower in Manhattan to LaGuardia Airport. Trump told Gates that ""more leaks were coming."" When it came to the Trump campaign conspiring with Russia to influence the election, Mueller's report, released in April, found that no charges were warranted, but that there is still information he did not know. “While the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign,” Mueller wrote about a conspiracy with Russia, “the evidence was not sufficient to support criminal charges.” Relevant document on page 42:

Bannon told the FBI that Jared Kushner vacationed with a Russian oligarch Bannon told FBI investigators that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner were on vacation in Croatia with a “Russian billionaire” in August 2016 — appearing to confirm a long-suspected and long-denied connection between Trump world and a Russian oligarch.



Messages between Bannon and an unnamed individual with a Breitbart domain email address — exchanged in July 2017, one month before Bannon was fired from his position as White House chief strategist — revealed that they were hoping to leverage this information against Kushner. Bannon cofounded the far-right Breitbart and rejoined it in August 2017. The messages and information were documented as part of an interview with then–special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigators, and were revealed by BuzzFeed News for the first time Saturday. Representatives for Kushner and Ivanka Trump didn’t immediately return requests for comment. In a Feb. 14, 2018, interview with the special counsel’s office, Bannon said that Kushner had been on vacation with a Russian oligarch when he took over the Trump campaign in August 2016. In the documents released Saturday, Bannon told investigators that Kushner had been in Croatia with the unnamed Russian billionaire, Rupert Murdoch’s ex-wife Wendi Deng, and the Russian’s girlfriend, whom Bannon said his sources in the intelligence community found to be “questionable.” Relevant document on page 109:

Kushner and his family’s Croatian vacation in August 2016 was widely covered in the media. Throughout the trip, Deng was photographed with Kushner and his wife, Ivanka, who also shared a picture of herself and Deng in Dubrovnik on her Instagram account.

Deng didn’t immediately return a request for comment. Bannon referenced Kushner’s vacation in an email dated July 24, 2017, to an individual with a Breitbart domain email address whose name has been redacted. Bannon appeared to indicate that the information, if reported and confirmed, could be valuable against Kushner, his rival for power in the Trump administration. “He was on ‘vacation’ off the coast of Croatia with a Russian billionaire when I took over the campaign,” Bannon wrote.



“How do we prove that?” The unnamed person replied. “That’s game set match.” Relevant document on page 178:

The same day as these emails, Bannon exchanged messages with someone at Breitbart about a Guardian story reporting that Kushner secured a real estate deal with another Soviet-born oligarch.

“Don’t touch yet,” Bannon said. “k this is big though isn’t it? It’s the ball game…” the Breitbart person responded. “All and everything,” Bannon replied. Relevant document on page 179:

Manafort was advising the Trump campaign up until days before the election Bannon’s emails show that Manafort was still advising the Trump campaign three days before the Nov. 8, 2016 election — despite having been fired in August — and said the campaign needed to hide that fact. Manafort emailed Kushner on Nov. 5 and wrote that he was “feeling really good about our prospects on Tuesday.” He said that he was focused “on preserving the victory” and had sent Kushner “a memo deal[ing] with this concern.” Manafort wrote that he had sent the memo to Reince Priebus, the former chair of the Republican National Committee and Trump's former chief of staff, and “briefed Rick Gates and Hannity.” Kushner forwarded the email to Bannon the same day and asked him what he thought. “We need to avoid this guy like the plague,” Bannon said in an email to Kushner dated Nov. 5. “Paul is nice guy but can’t let word get out he is advising us.” “They are going to try to say the Russians worked with wiki leaks to give this victory to us.” Relevant document on page 238:

Page 29, Rick Gates's 302: Gates said Trump's ""Russia if you're listening"" line was an ""ad lib."" He was referring to Trump's comment, ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,"" at a July 27, 2016, press conference in Florida. He was urging Russian hackers to work to find emails belonging to his opponent, Hillary Clinton. Gates also said that he recalled ""staff meeting conversations about 'someone out there has to have the missing emails.'""

A Trump associate sent Bannon a bizarre debate tactic Trump supporter and associate Ted Malloch emailed Bannon before the first debate and said Trump should start by handing Hillary Clinton a ""Writ of Indictment.""

Trump and his associates by that time had led ""lock her up"" chants at his rallies at the Republican National Convention. And he told Clinton during the second debate she'd ""be in jail"" if he became president over her email controversy. Relevant document on page 230:

Bannon on recognizing the Israeli capital as Jerusalem In December 2017 Trump formally recognized the contested city of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The move broke with the long-standing international consensus to refrain from recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital until it brokered a peace agreement with the Palestinians. But Trump made it a major campaign pledge. After a Feb. 14, 2018, interview, the FBI wrote, ""Bannon had been working on a proposal to move the Israeli capital to Jerusalem, the Christian right movement, putting money into a 501(c)(4) using UAE money or 'those guys' which didn't end up happening, and putting together a security conference over in the Middle East in the Spring/Summer of 2017.

Whether the Party Happened

Statement from Blasey There were four boys I remember specifically being there: Brett Kavanaugh, Mark Judge, a boy named P.J. and one other boy whose name I cannot recall. I also remember my friend Leland attending. Statement from Kavanaugh All four witnesses who are alleged to be at the event said it didn’t happen.

When It Happened

Statement from Blasey One evening that summer, after a day of diving at the club, I attended a small gathering at a house in the Bethesda area. Statement from Kavanaugh The event described by Dr. Ford, presumably happened on a weekend because I believed everyone worked and had jobs in the summers.

Kavanaugh’s calendar However, Judge Kavanaugh’s calendar entries show at least two weekend parties and one social gathering during the week. On July 1, a Thursday, he noted plans to go to “Timmy’s for skis,” slang for drinking beers, with three of the people Dr. Blasey said were at the gathering where she said the alleged assault occurred.

The document was not just an allegation of sexual assault against Special Counsel Robert Mueller , a favorite enemy of President Trump 's supporters -- it was also an opportunity to troll liberals , supporters of the # MeToo movement , and the media .
`` We believe the victim ... we believe the victim ... we believe the victim ... , '' the top comment read . `` Proof does n't matter . It 's the seriousness of the charge , '' another commenter responded . A reply to that said , `` Absolutely . Anyone who does n't believe her is supporting sexual assault and attacking alll women . '' And then another : `` Lol time to rub it in . ''
Just a few hours later , however , the story collapsed . Journalists and internet sleuths tied a scheme to smear Mueller with charges of sexual assault to an entity called Surefire Intelligence . That firm was tied to 20-year-old Jacob Wohl , a far-right internet personality who has written for The Gateway Pundit and who was previously banned from financial trading by the National Futures Association over allegations of fraud , and to a number of fake LinkedIn profiles apparently intended to create the impression that Surefire Intelligence was a legitimate and impressive organization with several employees .
The Gateway Pundit 's founder , Jim Hoft , removed the document from his website and published an editor 's note in its place . He said that there were `` very serious allegations against Jacob Wohl '' and that he was `` looking into '' them . Hoft did not respond to phone calls or an email from CNN seeking comment .
It is still unclear exactly who or how many people were involved with the scheme , or what their motives were . Did they want to discredit Mueller ? Were they trying to setup reporters in an attempt to smear them ? Were they just in it for themselves ?
The bizarre saga appeared to have kicked into gear over the last few weeks when reporters from various news organizations were emailed by a person or people who identified themself as Lorraine Parsons . Parsons , who did not respond to requests for comment from CNN and has reportedly declined to speak to several other media organizations , said she had been offered money in exchange for making a sexual assault allegation against Mueller .
The matter has now been referred to the FBI for investigation .
`` When we learned last week of allegations that women were offered money to make false claims about the Special Counsel , we immediately referred the matter to the FBI for investigation , '' Peter Carr , a spokesman for the Special Counsel 's office , said in a statement on Tuesday .
In the email to reporters , Parsons claimed to have worked at a law firm with Mueller in the 1970s , though the law firm has said it had no records of her being employed there . Parsons said that the person who had contacted her about making a sexual assault allegation in exchange for money said he was working for Republican lobbyist Jack Burkman .
On Tuesday morning , Wohl tweeted that a `` scandalous story about Mueller '' would be `` breaking tomorrow . ''
Burkman announced shortly after that he would be holding a press conference on Thursday to `` reveal the first of Special Counsel Robert Mueller 's sex assault victims . ''
The Gateway Pundit , which Wohl writes for , then published the document detailing what it portrayed as an unidentified woman 's accusation that Mueller had raped her .
As the story gained media attention , Vermont Law School professor Jennifer Taub , who has previously written for CNN 's opinion section , said she too had received an email from an individual offering to compensate her `` at whatever rate you see fit '' for discussing `` past encounters with Robert Mueller . ''
Taub told CNN she had never met or spoken with Mueller , and that she had forwarded the email to the Department of Justice .
The individual who emailed Taub identified himself as Simon Frick , who claimed to be a researcher for Surefire Intelligence . Ed Krassenstein , a liberal Twitter personality who writes for HillReporter.com , said he had also been contacted by an individual claiming to work for Surefire Intelligence after he looked into claims from Parsons .
Phone numbers listed on the Surefire Intelligence website , however , automatically redirected callers to a voicemail for Wohl 's mother .
Twitter users pointed out that the same Google user who had uploaded images for the Surefire Intelligence website had also previously uploaded images for a website Wohl used for an asset management firm .
Aric Toler , a researcher for Bellingcat , an organization that uses online and open source material to conduct investigations , also noted that a LinkedIn profile for Simon Frick used a picture of Christoph Waltz , an actor who has starred in movies including `` Django Unchained , '' `` Muppets Most Wanted , '' and the James Bond film `` Spectre . ''
And Jane Mayer , a writer for The New Yorker , noted that a LinkedIn photo of an individual claiming to be the head of Surefire Intelligence appeared to simply be a darkened photograph of Wohl . ( The picture had been removed from the profile by the time CNN viewed it Tuesday afternoon . )

Wohl himself even apparently confirmed a link between Burkman and Surefire Intelligence . He told The Daily Beast that Burkman had hired Surefire Intelligence to help him investigate Mueller 's past . Burkman , however , told CNN that he does n't `` comment on any employees or subcontractors . ''
When reached for comment through Twitter 's direct message feature and asked about his ties to Surefire Intelligence , Wohl said , `` Sounds like a kooky Russiagate conspiracy theory . ''
When CNN dialed a number listed on Surefire Intelligence 's website , an unknown individual answered . That person told CNN that he did n't know what Surefire Intelligence was -- `` it does n't ring a bell '' -- and , when asked to identify himself , said `` do n't call '' if `` you are n't sure '' who the number belongs to .
Several hours later , phone numbers listed for Surefire Intelligence on its website had been disconnected . At least some of the LinkedIn profiles that showed purported employees of Surefire were also taken down , as were two articles on Medium promoting the company under the guise of news stories .
Burkman said on Twitter Tuesday night that `` the allegations of paying a woman are false . ''
Burkman is a Republican operative who has a history of organizing stunts that get him attention , present narratives aimed at benefitting the GOP , and ultimately fall apart in spectacular fashion .
For instance , earlier this year , Burkman helped peddle conspiracy theories about the murder of Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich when he announced a press conference in which he said he would `` present a witness '' who would identify two individuals who had information about Rich 's murder .
However , when reporters arrived , Burkman said the witness would call in , and not appear in person . After technical difficulties establishing a phone connection , the witness , who was not identified by name , rambled instead of providing actual information .

Michael Flynn Also Reveal Broad Corruption in the Russiagate Investigations,2020-05-14,,"Watch our latest episode of SYSTEM UPDATE exploring this topic here or on ███ ’ s YouTube channel .
Gen. Michael Flynn , President Obama ’ s former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and President Donald Trump ’ s former national security adviser , pleaded guilty on December 1 , 2017 , to a single count of lying to the FBI about two conversations he had with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak while Flynn served as a Trump transition team official ( Flynn was never charged for any matters relating to his relationship with the Turkish government ) . As part of the plea deal , special counsel Robert Mueller recommended no jail time for Flynn , and the plea agreement also seemingly put an end to threats from the Mueller team to prosecute Flynn ’ s son . Last Thursday , the Justice Department filed a motion seeking to dismiss the prosecution of Flynn based , in part , on newly discovered documents revealing that the conduct of the FBI , under the leadership of Director James Comey and his now-disgraced Deputy Andrew McCabe ( who himself was forced to leave the Bureau after being caught lying to agents ) , was improper and motivated by corrupt objectives . That motion prompted histrionic howls of outrage from the same political officials and their media allies who have spent the last three years pushing maximalist Russiagate conspiracy theories . But the prosecution of Flynn — for allegedly lying to the FBI when he denied in a January 24 interrogation that he had discussed with Kislyak on December 29 the new sanctions and expulsions imposed on Russia by the Obama administration — was always odd for a number of reasons . To begin with , the FBI agents who questioned Flynn said afterward that they did not believe he was lying ( as CNN reported in February 2017 : “ the FBI interviewers believed Flynn was cooperative and provided truthful answers . Although Flynn didn ’ t remember all of what he talked about , they don ’ t believe he was intentionally misleading them , the officials say ” ) . For that reason , CNN said , “ the FBI is not expected to pursue any charges against ” him . More importantly , there was no valid reason for the FBI to have interrogated Flynn about his conversations with Kislyak in the first place . There is nothing remotely untoward or unusual — let alone criminal — about an incoming senior national security official , three weeks away from taking over , reaching out to a counterpart in a foreign government to try to tamp down tensions . As the Washington Post put it , “ it would not be uncommon for incoming administrations to interface with foreign governments with whom they will soon have to work . ”
What newly released documents over the last month reveal is what has been generally evident for the last three years : The powers of the security state agencies — particularly the FBI , the CIA , the NSA , and the DOJ — were systematically abused as part of the 2016 election and then afterward for political rather than legal ends . While there was obviously deceit and corruption on the part of some Trump officials in lying to Russiagate investigators and otherwise engaging in depressingly common D.C. lobbyist corruption , there was also massive corruption on the part of the investigators themselves , exploiting and abusing their vast and invasive investigative and prosecutorial powers for ideological goals , political subterfuge , election manipulation , and personal vendettas . The former category ( corruption by Trump officials ) has received a tidal wave of endless media attention , while the latter ( corruption and abuse of power by those investigating them ) has received almost none . For numerous reasons , it is vital to fully examine with as much clarity as possible the abuse of power that drove the prosecution of Flynn . To begin with , cable and other news outlets that employed former Obama-era intelligence operatives , generals , and prosecutors to disseminate every Russiagate conspiracy theory they could find — virtually always without any dissent or even questioning — have barely acknowledged these explosive new documents . More disturbingly , liberals and Democrats — as part of their movement toward venerating these security state agencies — have completely jettisoned long-standing , core principles about the criminal justice system , including questioning whether lying to the FBI should be a crime at all and recognizing that innocent people are often forced to plead guilty — in order to justify both the Flynn prosecution and the broader Mueller probe . But the most critical reason to delve deeply into this case is that it reveals one the most dangerous abuses of power a democracy can suffer : The powers of the CIA , FBI , and NSA were blatantly and repeatedly abused to manipulate election outcomes and achieve political advantage . In other words , we know now that these agencies did exactly what Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer warned they would do to Trump when he appeared on Rachel Maddow ’ s MSNBC program shortly before Trump ’ s inauguration :
This turned out to be one of the most prescient and important ( and creepy ) statements of the Trump presidency : from Chuck Schumer to Rachel Maddow - in early January , 2017 , before Trump was even inaugurated : pic.twitter.com/TUaYkksILG — Glenn Greenwald ( @ ggreenwald ) April 8 , 2019","Watch our latest episode of SYSTEM UPDATE exploring this topic here or on The Intercept’s YouTube channel.

To begin with, the FBI agents who questioned Flynn said afterward that they did not believe he was lying (as CNN reported in February 2017: “the FBI interviewers believed Flynn was cooperative and provided truthful answers. Although Flynn didn’t remember all of what he talked about, they don’t believe he was intentionally misleading them, the officials say”). For that reason, CNN said, “the FBI is not expected to pursue any charges against” him. More importantly, there was no valid reason for the FBI to have interrogated Flynn about his conversations with Kislyak in the first place. There is nothing remotely untoward or unusual — let alone criminal — about an incoming senior national security official, three weeks away from taking over, reaching out to a counterpart in a foreign government to try to tamp down tensions. As the Washington Post put it, “it would not be uncommon for incoming administrations to interface with foreign governments with whom they will soon have to work.”

What newly released documents over the last month reveal is what has been generally evident for the last three years: The powers of the security state agencies — particularly the FBI, the CIA, the NSA, and the DOJ — were systematically abused as part of the 2016 election and then afterward for political rather than legal ends. While there was obviously deceit and corruption on the part of some Trump officials in lying to Russiagate investigators and otherwise engaging in depressingly common D.C. lobbyist corruption, there was also massive corruption on the part of the investigators themselves, exploiting and abusing their vast and invasive investigative and prosecutorial powers for ideological goals, political subterfuge, election manipulation, and personal vendettas. The former category (corruption by Trump officials) has received a tidal wave of endless media attention, while the latter (corruption and abuse of power by those investigating them) has received almost none. For numerous reasons, it is vital to fully examine with as much clarity as possible the abuse of power that drove the prosecution of Flynn. To begin with, cable and other news outlets that employed former Obama-era intelligence operatives, generals, and prosecutors to disseminate every Russiagate conspiracy theory they could find — virtually always without any dissent or even questioning — have barely acknowledged these explosive new documents. More disturbingly, liberals and Democrats — as part of their movement toward venerating these security state agencies — have completely jettisoned long-standing, core principles about the criminal justice system, including questioning whether lying to the FBI should be a crime at all and recognizing that innocent people are often forced to plead guilty — in order to justify both the Flynn prosecution and the broader Mueller probe. But the most critical reason to delve deeply into this case is that it reveals one the most dangerous abuses of power a democracy can suffer: The powers of the CIA, FBI, and NSA were blatantly and repeatedly abused to manipulate election outcomes and achieve political advantage. In other words, we know now that these agencies did exactly what Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer warned they would do to Trump when he appeared on Rachel Maddow’s MSNBC program shortly before Trump’s inauguration:

The committee is examining what cyber activity Russia engaged in against the United States and its allies and whether Russia's ""active measures"" against the election included links between Moscow and individuals associated with political campaigns.

As a result, the hearing is likely to feature questions about potential contacts between Trump campaign aides and Russian officials. News broke on Thursday that Michael Flynn--who resigned as national security adviser following revelations of his communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislak--took money from multiple Russian firms during the campaign.

Lawmakers are also poised to delve into Trump's claims that the Obama administration ""wiretapped"" Trump Tower ahead of the election, which the president lodged on Twitter two weeks ago but have remained unsubstantiated.

Leaders of the intelligence panels in both chambers of Congress said they have yet to see any evidence of Trump's allegations. The White House, meanwhile, insisted the president stands by his statements but have also worked to downplay his claims.

On Friday, the Justice Department sent documents to the House committee in response to a request for information about whether Trump or his aides were subject to surveillance. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) confirmed that the panel had received the information, but noted that the FBI and CIA had not yet complied with a request for information to determine “whether information collected on U.S. persons was mishandled or leaked.”

It is unclear what the DOJ actually sent the committee--the documents are classified--though Nunes told ""Fox News Sunday"" that the documents do not prove that there was a physical wiretap of Trump Tower. ""if you take the president literally, it didn't happen,"" Nunes said, though he noted that he is still concerns about ""other surveillance activities,"" specifically those related to Flynn.

The hearing is scheduled to last three hours.

WAITING FOR TRUMP'S EXECUTIVE ORDER:

The coming week could also bring more speculation on Trump's executive order on cybersecurity, which has been delayed since the end of January. Industry leaders have anxiously awaited the release of the revised order with little information on the expected timing.

A White House adviser gave a preview of the administration's priorities on cybersecurity at a conference in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, disclosing plans to protect the federal network by requiring agencies to adopt the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity framework and tracking them on their progress.

Tom Bossert, who advises Trump on homeland security and counterterrorism, also emphasized the new administration's desire to deepen cooperation with the private sector, which was welcomed warmly by industry representatives.

CYBER INSIDE AND OUTSIDE CONGRESS:

There will be other events on cyber to track in the upcoming week, both on and off Capitol Hill.

The House Homeland Security Committee will hold a full committee hearing on defending against cyber threats on Wednesday. The committee will hear from a panel of outside experts that will include former NSA Director Keith Alexander and Michael Daniel, a former White House cyber coordinator under the Obama administration who now serves as president of the Cyber Threat Alliance.

fbi,The Daily Caller,2,https://dailycaller.com/2020/01/11/david-kris-fbi-fisa-carter-page-nunes/,Ex-DOJ Official Picked To Assist FISA Reform Was Ardent Defender Of FBI’s Surveillance Of Carter Page,2020-01-11,,"Former DOJ official David Kris was picked Friday to oversee the FBI ’ s reforms of its surveillance procedures in the wake of a damning inspector general ’ s report .
Kris was an ardent defender of the FBI ’ s surveillance of Carter Page . He was also a vocal critic of Republicans who suggested the FBI misled the surveillance court in its applications to wiretap Page .
In one essay , Kris endorsed a suggestion that Rep. Devin Nunes should face obstruction of justice charges .
Nunes told ███ News Foundation the choice of Kris is “ shocking and inexplicable . ”
A former Justice Department official picked Friday to oversee the FBI ’ s reforms of its surveillance procedures in the wake of a damning inspector general ’ s report was one of the many pundits during the Russia probe to defend the bureau ’ s surveillance of Trump campaign aide Carter Page .
David S. Kris , a former assistant attorney general for national security , was also an outspoken critic of Rep. Devin Nunes and other congressional Republicans who accused the FBI of misleading the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ( FISC ) in applications to wiretap Page .
An inspector general ’ s ( IG ) report released Dec. 9 , 2019 , largely vindicated Republicans and Page . The report identified 17 errors and omissions the FBI made in its four applications to surveil Page . The IG also said the FBI was unable to corroborate allegations that Page was a Russian agent .
Judge James E. Boasberg , who presides over the FISC , tapped Kris serve as amicus curiae for a review of the FBI ’ s handling of the Page surveillance warrants . In that role , Kris will “ assist ” the FISC in assessing the FBI ’ s implementation of a series of reforms to address the problems uncovered in the IG report .
Nunes and Page both panned the choice of Kris given his past commentary defending the FBI .
“ It ’ s hard to imagine a worse person the FISC could have chosen outside Comey , McCabe , or Schiff , ” Nunes , the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee , told ███ News Foundation .
Page also weighed in on Kris ’ s selection to oversee the FBI ’ s reforms .
“ If there were any hope for the system fixing this FISA mess , it extinguished with David Kris ’ appointment , ” he told The DCNF .
“ Nobody trying to fix the rampant abuse and coverup plaguing the entire FISA process would have picked Kris , ” continued Page , who called Kris a “ longtime FISA apologist . ”
“ Instead , you appoint Kris for only one reason : you don ’ t want the system fixed . You just want it to look like you do . ”
Kris , who served at the Justice Department from 2009 to 2011 , asserted in his writings during the Trump-Russia probe that Republicans had “ falsely accused ” the FBI of misleading the FISC in its wiretap applications .
He also accepted the FBI ’ s assertion that there was probable cause to believe that Page was a foreign agent of Russia — an allegation that was all but debunked by the special counsel ’ s report and the inspector general ’ s report .
“ It ’ s disturbing that Page met that legal standard and that there was probable cause to conclude he was a Russian agent , ” Kris wrote in an essay March 1 , 2018 , at Lawfare , a blog operated by the Brookings Institution .
Kris ’ s assessment — which echoed that of many Democrats and liberals in the media — accepted the FBI ’ s claim at face value that Page was a Russian asset . The FBI made the assertion in four applications to the FISC to wiretap Page . The basis for the allegation was the Democrat-funded Steele dossier .
The Justice Department inspector general ’ s report offered a brutal rebuke of the FBI ’ s surveillance of Page . It also offered a scathing portrait of Christopher Steele , the former British spy who wrote the dossier .
The IG report said the FBI withheld information regarding Page , a former Naval officer , that undercut the idea that he was a Russian agent . FBI agents also failed to disclose information that raised questions about Steele ’ s credibility and reliability .
The FBI failed to inform the FISC that one of Steele ’ s main dossier sources told agents in January 2017 that Steele misrepresented and exaggerated information in the dossier , including about Page . ( RELATED : Steele Dossier Was ‘ Central And Essential ’ To FBI ’ s Decision To Obtain Carter Page FISA )

A request for comment submitted to Kris ’ s consulting firm , Culper Partners , was not returned .","Former DOJ official David Kris was picked Friday to oversee the FBI’s reforms of its surveillance procedures in the wake of a damning inspector general’s report.

Kris was an ardent defender of the FBI’s surveillance of Carter Page. He was also a vocal critic of Republicans who suggested the FBI misled the surveillance court in its applications to wiretap Page.

In one essay, Kris endorsed a suggestion that Rep. Devin Nunes should face obstruction of justice charges.

Nunes told the Daily Caller News Foundation the choice of Kris is “shocking and inexplicable.”

A former Justice Department official picked Friday to oversee the FBI’s reforms of its surveillance procedures in the wake of a damning inspector general’s report was one of the many pundits during the Russia probe to defend the bureau’s surveillance of Trump campaign aide Carter Page.

David S. Kris, a former assistant attorney general for national security, was also an outspoken critic of Rep. Devin Nunes and other congressional Republicans who accused the FBI of misleading the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) in applications to wiretap Page.

An inspector general’s (IG) report released Dec. 9, 2019, largely vindicated Republicans and Page. The report identified 17 errors and omissions the FBI made in its four applications to surveil Page. The IG also said the FBI was unable to corroborate allegations that Page was a Russian agent.

Judge James E. Boasberg, who presides over the FISC, tapped Kris serve as amicus curiae for a review of the FBI’s handling of the Page surveillance warrants. In that role, Kris will “assist” the FISC in assessing the FBI’s implementation of a series of reforms to address the problems uncovered in the IG report.

Nunes and Page both panned the choice of Kris given his past commentary defending the FBI.

“It’s hard to imagine a worse person the FISC could have chosen outside Comey, McCabe, or Schiff,” Nunes, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

“The choice is shocking and inexplicable.”

Page also weighed in on Kris’s selection to oversee the FBI’s reforms.

“If there were any hope for the system fixing this FISA mess, it extinguished with David Kris’ appointment,” he told The DCNF.

“Nobody trying to fix the rampant abuse and coverup plaguing the entire FISA process would have picked Kris,” continued Page, who called Kris a “longtime FISA apologist.”

“Instead, you appoint Kris for only one reason: you don’t want the system fixed. You just want it to look like you do.”

Kris, who served at the Justice Department from 2009 to 2011, asserted in his writings during the Trump-Russia probe that Republicans had “falsely accused” the FBI of misleading the FISC in its wiretap applications.

He also accepted the FBI’s assertion that there was probable cause to believe that Page was a foreign agent of Russia — an allegation that was all but debunked by the special counsel’s report and the inspector general’s report.

“It’s disturbing that Page met that legal standard and that there was probable cause to conclude he was a Russian agent,” Kris wrote in an essay March 1, 2018, at Lawfare, a blog operated by the Brookings Institution.

Kris’s assessment — which echoed that of many Democrats and liberals in the media — accepted the FBI’s claim at face value that Page was a Russian asset. The FBI made the assertion in four applications to the FISC to wiretap Page. The basis for the allegation was the Democrat-funded Steele dossier.

The Justice Department inspector general’s report offered a brutal rebuke of the FBI’s surveillance of Page. It also offered a scathing portrait of Christopher Steele, the former British spy who wrote the dossier.

The IG report said the FBI withheld information regarding Page, a former Naval officer, that undercut the idea that he was a Russian agent. FBI agents also failed to disclose information that raised questions about Steele’s credibility and reliability.

The FBI failed to inform the FISC that one of Steele’s main dossier sources told agents in January 2017 that Steele misrepresented and exaggerated information in the dossier, including about Page. (RELATED: Steele Dossier Was ‘Central And Essential’ To FBI’s Decision To Obtain Carter Page FISA)

The IG report said FBI agents inaccurately stated in the FISA applications that Steele had provided information in the past that the bureau used in indictments and search warrants. The report said the claim was inaccurate, and that Steele’s associates had given mixed reviews about his reliability.

FISC Judge Rosemary Collyer ordered the FBI on Dec. 17, 2019, to provide a plan to address problems identified in the IG report.

Recently I 've been listening to the podcast Slow Burn , about Watergate . There 's a fascinating theme throughout it : When you 're living a historical event , how do you know ? How can you tell when a development is a big deal ?
This is a big deal . It 's very early on , but here 's some things we can already tell .
1 . According to Cohen 's own lawyer , the U.S. Attorney 's Office for the Southern District of New York ( widely regarded within itself as being the most important and prestigious U.S. Attorney 's Office in the country ) secured the search warrants for the FBI , based on a referral from Robert Mueller 's office .

2 . Moreover , it 's not just that the office thought that there was enough for a search warrant . They thought there was enough for a search warrant of an attorney 's office for that attorney 's client communications . That 's a very fraught and extraordinary move that requires multiple levels of authorization within the Department of Justice . The U.S. Attorney 's Manual ( USAM ) —at Section 9-13.320—contains the relevant policies and procedures . The highlights :
The feds are only supposed to raid a law firm if less intrusive measures wo n't work . As the USAM puts it :
In order to avoid impinging on valid attorney-client relationships , prosecutors are expected to take the least intrusive approach consistent with vigorous and effective law enforcement when evidence is sought from an attorney actively engaged in the practice of law . Consideration should be given to obtaining information from other sources or through the use of a subpoena , unless such efforts could compromise the criminal investigation or prosecution , or could result in the obstruction or destruction of evidence , or would otherwise be ineffective .
Such a search requires high-level approval . The USAM requires such a search warrant to be approved by the U.S. attorney—the head of the office , a presidential appointee—and requires `` consultation '' with the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice . This is not a couple of rogue AUSAs sneaking in a warrant .
Such a search requires an elaborate review process . The basic rule is that the government may not deliberately seize , or review , attorney-client communications . The USAM—and relevant caselaw—therefore require the feds to set up a review process . That process might involve a judge reviewing the materials to separate out what is privileged ( or what might fall within an exception to the privilege ) , or else set up a `` dirty team '' that does the review but is insulated from the `` clean team '' running the investigation . Another option is a `` special master , '' an experienced and qualified third-party attorney to do the review . Sometimes the reviewing team will only be identifying and protecting privileged material . Sometimes the reviewing team will be preparing to seek , or to implement , a court ruling that the documents are not privileged . ( Robert Mueller is aggressive on this sort of thing ; he already sought and obtained a court ruling that some of Paul Manafort 's communications with his lawyers were not privileged because they were undertaken for the purpose of fraud—the so-called `` crime-fraud exception '' to the attorney-client privilege . )
3 . A magistrate judge signed off on this . Federal magistrate judges ( appointed by local district judges , not by the president ) review search warrant applications . A magistrate judge therefore reviewed this application and found probable cause—that is , probable cause to believe that the subject premises ( Cohen 's office ) contains specified evidence of a specified federal crime . Now , magistrate judges sometimes are a little too rubber-stampy for my taste ( notably , recall the time that a magistrate judge signed off on a truly ludicrous gag order forbidding ███ from revealing that it had been served with a subpoena for information identifying commenters ) . But here , where the magistrate judge knew that this would become one of the most scrutinized search warrant applications ever , and because the nature of the warrant of an attorney 's office is unusual , you can expect that the magistrate judge felt pretty confident that there was enough there .
4 . The search warrant application ( the lengthy narrative from the FBI agent setting for the evidence ) is almost certainly still under seal , and even Michael Cohen does n't get to see it ( yet ) . But the FBI would have left the warrant itself—and that shows ( 1 ) the federal criminal statutes they were investigating , and ( 2 ) the list of items they wanted to seize .

It 's early times . Watch for the search warrant itself—that will show us what crimes they are investigating and what documents they think are probative of that crime . Watch also for what Michael Cohen 's lawyers do in the struggle to compel arbitration with Stormy Daniels in a federal court in Los Angeles—the search warrant dramatically complicates whether Cohen can , or should , submit to any questions in that case .

fbi,American Spectator,2,https://spectator.org/why-the-fbi-is-dodging-nunes/,Why the FBI Is Dodging Nunes,,"George Neumayr, Wesley J. Smith, Robert Stacy Mccain, Jeffrey Lord, R. Emmett Tyrrell, Jed Babbin","The left used to get very worked up about the CIA ’ s interference in foreign elections . Liberals would quote solemnly the work of Philip Agee , a CIA turncoat who wrote articles and books about the agency ’ s manipulation of this or that foreign election . But these days ACLU-style liberals shrug at the meddling of John Brennan ’ s CIA in the 2016 American election , mischief that the FBI is still trying to conceal .
It was reported recently that the FBI refuses to show Congressman Devin Nunes an unredacted copy of the origination document that triggered the probe into the Trump campaign . What is the FBI hiding ? Paradoxically , nothing — that is , no classified information showing collusion between Trump and Russia . The FBI is simply trying to hide the embarrassingly partisan origins of its spying on the Trump campaign .
Were the redactions covering material harmful to Trump , that material would have been leaked by now . So the redactions can only be concealing the fingerprints of Hillary ’ s partisans in the Obama administration . The FBI will eventually have to fess up to the politicization to which it succumbed — that the most virulent Hillary partisan imaginable , John Brennan , had put pressure on FBI officials to start the probe , that a Trump hater , Peter Strzok , formally opened up the probe , that the smears of a paid opposition researcher for Hillary , Christopher Steele , contributed to the probe , that scandalous “ intelligence-sharing ” between Brennan and foreign intelligence agencies shaped the probe , and that FBI officials suspected the probe was unfounded but pursued it anyways at the insistence of Obama officials .
The FBI says it is redacting “ sensitive information. ” That ’ s true in an ironic sense : the FBI is very sensitive about the information , in that it illuminates the agency ’ s transformation into an opposition research shop for the Hillary campaign . Take her partisans out of the picture and the probe would never have started .
In an attempt to sanitize the probe , the media has attributed its origin to a drunken conversation between an Aussie diplomat and a minor Trump campaign volunteer . But that ’ s a joke . Maybe the FBI threw that into the pot at the last minute , but John Brennan had been stirring it for months before then . As Brennan told Congress , “ we were uncovering information intelligence about interactions and contacts between U.S. persons and the Russians . And as we came upon that , we would share it with the bureau. ” Notice his use of “ we ” in that statement . By “ we , ” Brennan meant his retinue of Hillary partisans at the CIA who had been shaking foreign intelligence agencies down for any dirt on Trump .
The British intelligence , in cahoots with Brennan and Christopher Steele ( who was on Hillary ’ s payroll ) , figured largely into this mischief . In all likelihood it will come out that the “ information ” British intelligence shared with Brennan was just recycled Steele material . The “ allies tipped us off to Trump-Russian collusion ” storyline is a sham , designed to distract attention from a chain of Hillary partisans who in the thick of a campaign were circulating smears among themselves and calling it “ intelligence sharing . ”

Liberals would quote solemnly the work of Philip Agee, a CIA turncoat who wrote articles and books about the agency’s manipulation of this or that foreign election. But these days ACLU-style liberals shrug at the meddling of John Brennan’s CIA in the 2016 American election, mischief that the FBI is still trying to conceal.

It was reported recently that the FBI refuses to show Congressman Devin Nunes an unredacted copy of the origination document that triggered the probe into the Trump campaign. What is the FBI hiding? Paradoxically, nothing — that is, no classified information showing collusion between Trump and Russia. The FBI is simply trying to hide the embarrassingly partisan origins of its spying on the Trump campaign.

Were the redactions covering material harmful to Trump, that material would have been leaked by now. So the redactions can only be concealing the fingerprints of Hillary’s partisans in the Obama administration. The FBI will eventually have to fess up to the politicization to which it succumbed — that the most virulent Hillary partisan imaginable, John Brennan, had put pressure on FBI officials to start the probe, that a Trump hater, Peter Strzok, formally opened up the probe, that the smears of a paid opposition researcher for Hillary, Christopher Steele, contributed to the probe, that scandalous “intelligence-sharing” between Brennan and foreign intelligence agencies shaped the probe, and that FBI officials suspected the probe was unfounded but pursued it anyways at the insistence of Obama officials.

The FBI says it is redacting “sensitive information.” That’s true in an ironic sense: the FBI is very sensitive about the information, in that it illuminates the agency’s transformation into an opposition research shop for the Hillary campaign. Take her partisans out of the picture and the probe would never have started.

In an attempt to sanitize the probe, the media has attributed its origin to a drunken conversation between an Aussie diplomat and a minor Trump campaign volunteer. But that’s a joke. Maybe the FBI threw that into the pot at the last minute, but John Brennan had been stirring it for months before then. As Brennan told Congress, “we were uncovering information intelligence about interactions and contacts between U.S. persons and the Russians. And as we came upon that, we would share it with the bureau.” Notice his use of “we” in that statement. By “we,” Brennan meant his retinue of Hillary partisans at the CIA who had been shaking foreign intelligence agencies down for any dirt on Trump.

The British intelligence, in cahoots with Brennan and Christopher Steele (who was on Hillary’s payroll), figured largely into this mischief. In all likelihood it will come out that the “information” British intelligence shared with Brennan was just recycled Steele material. The “allies tipped us off to Trump-Russian collusion” storyline is a sham, designed to distract attention from a chain of Hillary partisans who in the thick of a campaign were circulating smears among themselves and calling it “intelligence sharing.”

It was the blinding, viscerally personal hatred of Brennan for Trump, perhaps more than anything else, that turned all those phony “tips” into a counterintelligence probe. In the grip of that kind of feverish antipathy, combined with his desire to continue as CIA director under Hillary, Brennan could convince himself of any Trump monstrosity and made it his mission to prod the FBI into harassing him. Anyone who doubts that hatred should just take a look at Brennan’s Twitter account these days. This week he is rattling on about Trump’s “self adoration.” Also take a look at the people he is following on Twitter. They make up most of the cast of Obamagate, from James Comey to Samantha Power to Sally Yates to Susan Rice, not to mention the newest cast member, Obama chief of staff Denis McDonough, whose exposure is yet another product of Nunes’s refusal to accept redacted material from the FBI/Justice Department.

But it wasn’t enough for Brennan to push the FBI investigation. He also had to publicize it, which he achieved through another person in Christopher Steele’s orbit, Senator Harry Reid, whose Super PAC, as the Daily Caller reports, was run by the very Hillary lawyer who hired Steele’s services. Brennan briefed Reid on the beginnings of the FBI investigation he instigated, knowing that Reid would leak the contents of the briefing to the press.

The FBI clashed with the White House on Wednesday over the much discussed Republican memo that alleges the bureau abused its surveillance powers . The bureau said it has `` grave concerns '' about the `` accuracy '' of the document that the president supports making public .
Meanwhile , the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee , which voted to release the memo , says Republicans secretly made `` material changes '' to the document after the decision to make it public .
The FBI issued a rare , two-paragraph statement undercutting the position taken by President Trump and his top aides that the memo should be disclosed to the public soon .
`` With regard to the House Intelligence Committee 's memorandum , the FBI was provided a limited opportunity to review this memo the day before the committee voted to release it , '' the FBI said . `` As expressed during our initial review , we have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo 's accuracy . ''
The FBI statement appeared amid a bitter political fight over the memo , which was drawn up by committee Chairman Devin Nunes of California and the panel 's Republican staff . Nunes and other GOP allies of Trump say the memo makes the case about an epic scandal inside federal law enforcement .
The Justice Department has already said that releasing the memo would be `` extraordinarily reckless '' and could hurt national security or ongoing investigations .
Nunes , a Trump ally who served on the president 's transition team , responded to the FBI with a fiery statement of his own .
`` Having stonewalled Congress ' demands for information for nearly a year , it 's no surprise to see the FBI and DOJ issue spurious objections to allowing the American people to see information related to surveillance abuses at these agencies , '' he said , referring to the Department of Justice .
Nunes accused the FBI of leaving out important information in its presentations to Congress and the courts . And he invited the bureau to make public all the information it has on `` these abuses . ''
`` It 's clear that top officials used unverified information in a court document to fuel a counter-intelligence investigation during an American political campaign , '' Nunes said . `` Once the truth gets out , we can begin taking steps to ensure our intelligence agencies and courts are never misused like this again . ''
Democrats say the four-page document is misleading and part of an effort to undermine the bureau and Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller . His office is investigating possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia 's attack on the 2016 election .
The committee 's top Democrat , Adam Schiff , sent a letter Wednesday to Nunes charging that `` material changes '' had been made to the memo after it was voted on and that the version handed over to the White House `` is not , in fact , the same document . ''
`` Upon our discovery that the document sent for public review had been secretly altered , the Majority belatedly afforded the Minority an opportunity this evening to compare the document transmitted on Monday night by the Majority to the White House with the document made available to all House Members since January 18 , '' Schiff wrote .
`` After reviewing both versions , it is clear that the Majority made material changes to the version it sent to the White House , which Committee Members were never apprised of , never had the opportunity to review , and never approved , '' he added , calling the alleged alterations `` deeply troubling . ''
Republicans responded to the letter , saying Schiff 's complaints were merely a `` strange attempt to thwart publication of the memo . ''
Democrats were `` complaining about minor edits to the memo , including grammatical fixes and two edits requested by the F.B.I . and by [ Democrats ] themselves , '' Jack Langer , a spokesman for Nunes , said in a statement , according to The New York Times .
In a Washington Post op-ed , Schiff noted that the memo also paves the way for the possible firing of Mueller or the man overseeing the probe , Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein . That would allow the White House to replace Rosenstein with someone willing to shut down the investigation .
The intelligence committee voted along party lines on Monday to release the memo to the public . The White House says it is currently reviewing the document , and the president said Tuesday night that the chances of its being released are `` 100 percent . ''
For now , the memo remains classified . Lawmakers who have read it say it alleges the FBI and Justice Department gave scurrilous or incomplete evidence to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in order to surveil people in the Trump camp .
In its statement , the FBI says it `` takes seriously '' its obligations to the FISA court that approves surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes . The bureau says it is `` committed to working with the appropriate oversight entities to ensure the continuing integrity of the FISA process . ''
Current and former intelligence officials have expressed concern that the FBI would be unable to counter any factual errors or misrepresentations in the memo because the information it is based on remains classified .
The statements from the FBI and Nunes followed accusations by a Democrat on the intelligence committee that Nunes worked with the White House to prepare and now release the memo .
On CNN Wednesday , Rep. Mike Quigley , D-Ill. , relayed a conversation he said he had with Nunes during a committee meeting .
`` I asked the chairman , 'Did he work with ' [ the Trump administration ] , and I asked all the preliminaries — coordinate , discuss — and he said , 'not to my knowledge , ' `` Quigley said . `` And I asked him , 'Did your staff ? ' And then he became quite agitated and he said , ' I 'm not answering that . ' ``
Quigley said there was precedent for questioning Nunes ' contacts with the White House . He pointed to what he called the Republican chairman 's `` midnight ride '' to the White House in March to receive classified documents from the administration alleging improper `` unmasking '' of Trump associates in intelligence reports .
`` I fully believe that Chairman Nunes has not changed his tactics . He began this investigation as a subsidiary of the White House , as someone who was coordinating with them rather than being an independent investigator , '' Quigley said . `` The sad part is he is the chairman of the committee that is investigating the most important attack on our country 's democracy in our lifetime . ''
Nunes ' office did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
As Democrats raised questions about a possible White House role in crafting the memo , White House chief of staff John Kelly said he expected the memo to be made public soon .
`` It will be released here pretty quick , I think , and then the whole world can see it , '' Kelly told Fox News Radio on Wednesday .
Although the White House 's preference for making the memo public is clear , it remains unclear , at this point , exactly how the document would be released .
A senior Republican on the intelligence committee , Rep. Michael Conaway of Texas , told NPR that the memo would be published in the Congressional Record .
`` As I understand the mechanics , the way we actually release is that we insert it in the Congressional Record . The House has to be in session to do that , '' he said .
The House is currently out of session . It 's scheduled to return for a pro forma session Friday afternoon , so if Conaway is right , then late Friday is the earliest the memo could be officially released .","FBI Warns Of 'Grave Concerns' About 'Accuracy' Of GOP Snooping Memo

The FBI clashed with the White House on Wednesday over the much discussed Republican memo that alleges the bureau abused its surveillance powers. The bureau said it has ""grave concerns"" about the ""accuracy"" of the document that the president supports making public.

Meanwhile, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, which voted to release the memo, says Republicans secretly made ""material changes"" to the document after the decision to make it public.

The FBI issued a rare, two-paragraph statement undercutting the position taken by President Trump and his top aides that the memo should be disclosed to the public soon.

""As expressed during our initial review, we have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo's accuracy.""

The FBI statement appeared amid a bitter political fight over the memo, which was drawn up by committee Chairman Devin Nunes of California and the panel's Republican staff. Nunes and other GOP allies of Trump say the memo makes the case about an epic scandal inside federal law enforcement.

The Justice Department has already said that releasing the memo would be ""extraordinarily reckless"" and could hurt national security or ongoing investigations.

Nunes, a Trump ally who served on the president's transition team, responded to the FBI with a fiery statement of his own.

""Having stonewalled Congress' demands for information for nearly a year, it's no surprise to see the FBI and DOJ issue spurious objections to allowing the American people to see information related to surveillance abuses at these agencies,"" he said, referring to the Department of Justice.

Nunes accused the FBI of leaving out important information in its presentations to Congress and the courts. And he invited the bureau to make public all the information it has on ""these abuses.""

""It's clear that top officials used unverified information in a court document to fuel a counter-intelligence investigation during an American political campaign,"" Nunes said. ""Once the truth gets out, we can begin taking steps to ensure our intelligence agencies and courts are never misused like this again.""

Democrats say the four-page document is misleading and part of an effort to undermine the bureau and Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller. His office is investigating possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia's attack on the 2016 election.

The committee's top Democrat, Adam Schiff, sent a letter Wednesday to Nunes charging that ""material changes"" had been made to the memo after it was voted on and that the version handed over to the White House ""is not, in fact, the same document.""

""Upon our discovery that the document sent for public review had been secretly altered, the Majority belatedly afforded the Minority an opportunity this evening to compare the document transmitted on Monday night by the Majority to the White House with the document made available to all House Members since January 18,"" Schiff wrote.

""After reviewing both versions, it is clear that the Majority made material changes to the version it sent to the White House, which Committee Members were never apprised of, never had the opportunity to review, and never approved,"" he added, calling the alleged alterations ""deeply troubling.""

Republicans responded to the letter, saying Schiff's complaints were merely a ""strange attempt to thwart publication of the memo.""

Democrats were ""complaining about minor edits to the memo, including grammatical fixes and two edits requested by the F.B.I. and by [Democrats] themselves,"" Jack Langer, a spokesman for Nunes, said in a statement, according to The New York Times.

In a Washington Post op-ed, Schiff noted that the memo also paves the way for the possible firing of Mueller or the man overseeing the probe, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. That would allow the White House to replace Rosenstein with someone willing to shut down the investigation.

The intelligence committee voted along party lines on Monday to release the memo to the public. The White House says it is currently reviewing the document, and the president said Tuesday night that the chances of its being released are ""100 percent.""

For now, the memo remains classified. Lawmakers who have read it say it alleges the FBI and Justice Department gave scurrilous or incomplete evidence to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in order to surveil people in the Trump camp.

In its statement, the FBI says it ""takes seriously"" its obligations to the FISA court that approves surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes. The bureau says it is ""committed to working with the appropriate oversight entities to ensure the continuing integrity of the FISA process.""

Current and former intelligence officials have expressed concern that the FBI would be unable to counter any factual errors or misrepresentations in the memo because the information it is based on remains classified.

The statements from the FBI and Nunes followed accusations by a Democrat on the intelligence committee that Nunes worked with the White House to prepare and now release the memo.

On CNN Wednesday, Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., relayed a conversation he said he had with Nunes during a committee meeting.

""I asked the chairman, 'Did he work with' [the Trump administration], and I asked all the preliminaries — coordinate, discuss — and he said, 'not to my knowledge,' "" Quigley said. ""And I asked him, 'Did your staff?' And then he became quite agitated and he said, 'I'm not answering that.' ""

Quigley said there was precedent for questioning Nunes' contacts with the White House. He pointed to what he called the Republican chairman's ""midnight ride"" to the White House in March to receive classified documents from the administration alleging improper ""unmasking"" of Trump associates in intelligence reports.

""I fully believe that Chairman Nunes has not changed his tactics. He began this investigation as a subsidiary of the White House, as someone who was coordinating with them rather than being an independent investigator,"" Quigley said. ""The sad part is he is the chairman of the committee that is investigating the most important attack on our country's democracy in our lifetime.""

Nunes' office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

As Democrats raised questions about a possible White House role in crafting the memo, White House chief of staff John Kelly said he expected the memo to be made public soon.

""It will be released here pretty quick, I think, and then the whole world can see it,"" Kelly told Fox News Radio on Wednesday.

Although the White House's preference for making the memo public is clear, it remains unclear, at this point, exactly how the document would be released.

A senior Republican on the intelligence committee, Rep. Michael Conaway of Texas, told NPR that the memo would be published in the Congressional Record.

""As I understand the mechanics, the way we actually release is that we insert it in the Congressional Record. The House has to be in session to do that,"" he said.

The House is currently out of session. It's scheduled to return for a pro forma session Friday afternoon, so if Conaway is right, then late Friday is the earliest the memo could be officially released.",www.npr.org,center,DDmjleJnfjlfTUR0

The scandals were known as Travelgate and Filegate , and both set off extensive investigations , resignations , charges and countercharges of lying , file-scrubbing and unethical conduct .
The early 1990s shared issues and people with 2016 : Twenty years ago , there were the Clintons , of course . There was the “ politicization ” of the FBI , as one committee report put it . Mrs. Clinton ’ s staunch defender , Lanny Davis , appeared on TV blasting her critics , as he does today .
The conservative watchdog Judicial Watch sued the Clinton administration then , as it has done more recently , to compel disclosure of her State Department emails , of which more than 30,000 were destroyed — off-limits to the FBI . In the 1990s , White House files also went missing .
“ FBI leadership has a long history of kowtowing to the Clintons , ” Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said . “ And it meant that front-line FBI agents were either boxed in , abused or hung out to dry . Nothing has changed in 20 years . If anything , the Clintons have perfected the art of intimidating federal law enforcement . ”
One of those “ boxed in ” agents was Dennis Sculimbrene , now 74 and living miles from Washington in Virginia ’ s Shenandoah Valley . He became a star witness against the White House , which quickly made him persona non grata . As an ardent Hillary Clinton supporter , Mr. Davis , then a New York lawyer , called Mr. Sculimbrene a “ noncredible liar . ”
“ I would agree that this happened 20 years ago , but the actors are the same , ” Mr. Sculimbrene told The ███ .
Mr. Fitton says the FBI bowed to the Clintons back then just as they did in the investigation of Mrs. Clinton ’ s private email server and mishandling of the nation ’ s secrets . FBI Director James B. Comey said she was “ extremely careless ” in using a nonsecure private email server for official business , but would not be charged .
His statement sounded the same tone as an independent counsel who concluded in 2000 that Mrs. Clinton made “ factually false ” statements to investigators but there was not enough evidence to charge her with perjury .
“ When I heard Comey , I thought of [ then-FBI Director ] Louis Freeh and how they caved into HRC defense of her political career at the expense of the FBI ’ s reputation , ” said Mr. Sculimbrene , the top agent at the White House when the Clintons arrived in January 1993 .
Mr. Sculimbrene soon found himself as a witness against the Clintons and demonized by her surrogates — and by his FBI colleagues .
White House Counsel Jack Quinn wrote to the FBI calling the agent a liar . Mr. Davis , on CNN ’ s “ Crossfire ” in 1996 , said Mr. Sculimbrene falsified a memo to implicate Mrs. Clinton in Filegate .
By 1996 , the Vietnam War veteran and former Air Force pilot became a retired FBI agent . He was shown the door at age 54 . He said a supervisor told him that Mrs. Clinton “ wants you out . You make her uncomfortable . ”
One of the first bold moves by the Clinton White House was to wipe clean the travel office , firing all seven employees including its founder , Billy Dale . The office arranged presidential travel and chartered aircraft when needed .
The sackings brought charges that Mrs. Clinton had ordered the personnel massacre to hire her cronies , a Hollywood couple , and exert control over all support staff .
Mr. Dale , a longtime civil servant , suddenly found himself under criminal investigation by the FBI and charged with embezzling $ 68,000 .
This episode and others compelled William Safire , in-house Republican columnist at The New York Times , to call Mrs. Clinton a “ congenital liar . ”
A House committee report told of memos known to exist that were suddenly missing .
Seven years after Travelgate erupted , independent counsel Robert W. Ray issued a final report saying there was “ substantial evidence ” that Mrs. Clinton played a role in the firings , despite her denials , and that she provided “ factually false ” sworn statements .
But he concluded that there was “ insufficient ” evidence to prove Mrs. Clinton “ made any knowingly false statements , committed perjury or obstructed justice . ”
Mr. Ray also scolded the White House for its “ substantial resistance ” in turning over evidence .
In 1995 , it took a jury less than two hours to find Mr. Dale not guilty of embezzlement .
Mr. Sculimbrene further irked the White House by taking the unusual step of testifying in Mr. Dale ’ s defense . He believed his bosses generated a flimsy case to vindicate and protect the Clintons .
Congress ’ probe into Travelgate turned up a new scandal . An ex-bar bouncer and Democratic Party operative , Craig Livingstone , landed the prestigious job of director of White House personnel security .
He began requesting that the FBI provide sensitive personnel background files on Republicans and former White House people — 900 in all — for no discernible reason .
Republicans quickly charged dirty tricks , theorizing that as the only reason why someone so unqualified would be given such a prestigious position .
Mr. Sculimbrene cemented his status as a White House insurgent after he told investigators that he believed it was Mrs. Clinton who wanted Mr. Livingstone hired . If true , it would be a black mark on the first lady ’ s judgment .
The Republican-run House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform concluded in 1996 : “ In general , the FBI files issue shows a lack of respect by the Clinton administration for proper security procedures to protect both the President of the United States and the national security . ”
The committee accused the Clintons of politicizing the FBI . For example , the bureau ’ s general counsel owned a special White House pass , alerted the Clintons to the committee ’ s investigation , helped their staff write a letter to Director Freeh and provided a manuscript of former FBI agent Gary Aldrich ’ s unflattering , yet-to-be-released book , “ Unlimited Access . ”
The committee unearthed a 1993 memo from Mr. Sculimbrene that quoted White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum as saying Mr. Livingstone had “ come highly recommended by Hillary Clinton. ” This contradicted Mr. Nussbaum ’ s public version . Upon hearing this , the FBI general counsel dispatched agents to the recently retired Mr. Sculimbrene ’ s home for questioning .
“ The sending of agents to Sculimbrene ’ s home involved [ the general counsel ] in an operational matter , which is inappropriate for the general counsel , ” the House committee said .
Mr. Sculimbrene testified before the committee . He portrayed the Clinton White House as disorganized . Requests for background investigations of potential Cabinet members and other officials usually start arriving at the FBI a month before the presidential inauguration . With the Clintons , they did not start arriving until July — backdated . Some nominees failed to cooperate . Some used illegal drugs right up until the time they filled out an FBI form .
The Clintons first blamed Filegate on the Secret Service and FBI , then on a file clerk . Mr. Nussbaum testified that he did not know who hired Mr. Livingstone , to which a Republican congressman said everyone knows who hires them for a job .
Despite the scathing committee report , Mrs. Clinton fared better in this fiasco with Mr. Ray , the independent counsel . He found no evidence of criminality and accepted the White House explanation that the file transfer was a bureaucratic bungle , not a conspiracy to find dirt on Republicans .
Amid the Travelgate scandal in 1994 , Mr. Sculimbrene was working on his private plane when he accidentally started the engine , sending a propeller blade slicing into his head .
He suffered an open skull fracture and was air-evacuated to Fairfax Hospital . The damage caused post-traumatic stress disorder , deep depression , anxiety and severe insomnia . He lost vision and could not read or do math . But he defied odds and recovered , and returned to the White House that summer .
“ Only God knows why or how just pushing back on the prop started an engine that had not started in three weeks , but it did , until it met my head , ” Mr. Sculimbrene told The Times . “ My genes come from Calabria , Italy , who are known as ‘ hard heads. ’ A prop is like a butter knife . It ’ s not sharp enough to cut your steak , but with 180 pounds of horsepower , it ’ s enough to break your skull and enter your brain . ”
His professional life went downhill . His doctor advised an FBI nurse to restrict his physical duties , but the FBI ignored that , according to a slander lawsuit that Judicial Watch filed on his behalf . Supervisors sent him on trips , contrary to his physician ’ s advice , and made him work the night shift .
In February 1996 , the FBI notified him that he was under investigation for misuse of a government parking pass . The probe , his attorney said , was based on a single anonymous letter . In April , the FBI terminated his White House job , formally banned him from the Executive Office Building and ordered him to the field office in Tyson ’ s Corner , Virginia .
With Filegate in full throttle on Capitol Hill , Mr. Davis appeared on cable TV shows to paint the agent as a lair when it came to what Mr. Nussbaum had said .
“ Whatever smacked him in the head has affected his credibility , ” Mr. Davis told CNBC ’ s Geraldo Rivera , referring to the propeller gash .
Today , Mr. Sculimbrene makes this point : The interview with Mr. Nussbaum , in which he quoted him as saying Mrs. Clinton wanted Mr. Livingstone to get the job , was conducted in May 1993 , seven months before his accident .
Mr. Sculimbrene was forced to retire . Mr. Nussbaum had quit in 1994 , followed by Mr. Livingstone .
The Judicial Watch lawsuit alleged that Mr. Quinn , the White House counsel , Mr. Davis and others “ intentionally , maliciously and wrongfully conspired to injure ” the former agent .
Mr. Sculimbrene sought millions of dollars in damages but in 2003 settled with the FBI and Justice Department for $ 85,000 .
Of Mrs. Clinton , he recalls that she bristled at talk of any FBI investigation .
“ My best story about HRC was when I interviewed the spouse of one of HRC ’ s best college classmates . Both he and I found FBI ’ s request for a copy of his high school diploma . The catch was it was made on sheepskin , and part of a display on his wall at home . Even though he had sent a copy of his high school records , which indicated he had taken all courses required for graduation , and passed them , headquarters insisted on sending an agent to photograph the sheepskin , ” Mr. Sculimbrene said .
“ Later , while in his office , he approached me and said that he had a private Easter dinner with Hillary Clinton , the president and his spouse . He thought it would be a good story , and the president and his wife laughed . However , Hillary Clinton was really upset when she heard the story . She apparently didn ’ t think much of the FBI conducting investigations , and this was an example of the FBI ’ s intelligence , ” he said .
The Clintons left the White House much the same way as they came in . Bill Clinton pardoned fugitive financier Mark Rich , who was evading arrest by living in Europe . His ex-wife made large donations to the Democratic Party and gave $ 450,000 to what was then the Clinton Foundation and its goal of building a library .
That same foundation would grow into a $ 3 billion global charity , taking money from world leaders , banks and government contractors . Conservative journalists say Mrs. Clinton rewarded some of those donors with special access at the State Department .
Out the door , the Clintons took White House furniture back to Arkansas . When caught , they had to return some pieces .
ABC News reported at the time : “ After they were criticized for taking $ 190,000 worth of china , flatware , rugs , televisions , sofas and other gifts with them when they left , the Clintons announced last week that they would pay for $ 86,000 worth of gifts , or nearly half the amount . Their latest decision to send back $ 28,000 in gifts brings to $ 114,000 the value of items the Clintons have either decided to pay for or return . ”
Some Clinton staffers maliciously damaged White House computers that were to be used by the incoming George W.

Travelgate

One of the first bold moves by the Clinton White House was to wipe clean the travel office, firing all seven employees including its founder, Billy Dale. The office arranged presidential travel and chartered aircraft when needed.

The sackings brought charges that Mrs. Clinton had ordered the personnel massacre to hire her cronies, a Hollywood couple, and exert control over all support staff.

Mr. Dale, a longtime civil servant, suddenly found himself under criminal investigation by the FBI and charged with embezzling $68,000.

Accident

Amid the Travelgate scandal in 1994, Mr. Sculimbrene was working on his private plane when he accidentally started the engine, sending a propeller blade slicing into his head.

U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan told Flynn , a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general and former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency , that he had arguably betrayed his country . Sullivan also noted that Flynn had operated as an undeclared lobbyist for Turkey even as he worked on Trump ’ s campaign team and prepared to be his White House national security adviser .
Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about his December 2016 conversations with Sergei Kislyak , then Russia ’ s ambassador in Washington , about U.S. sanctions imposed on Moscow by the administration of Trump ’ s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama . The conversations took place between Trump ’ s November election victory and his inauguration in January 2017 .
Special Counsel Robert Mueller , leading the investigation into possible collusion between Trump ’ s campaign and Russia ahead of the election , had asked the judge not to sentence Flynn to prison because he had already provided “ substantial ” cooperation over the course of many interviews .
Lying to the FBI carries a statutory maximum sentence of five years in prison . Flynn ’ s plea agreement stated that he was eligible for a sentence of between zero and six months .
Sullivan sternly told Flynn his actions were abhorrent , noting that Flynn had also lied to senior White House officials , who in turn misled the public . The judge said he had read additional facts about Flynn ’ s behavior that have not been made public .
At one point , Sullivan asked prosecutors if Flynn could have been charged with treason , although the judge later said he had not been suggesting such a charge was warranted .
“ Arguably , you sold your country out , ” Sullivan told Flynn . “ I ’ m not hiding my disgust , my disdain for this criminal offense . ”
Related Coverage Factbox : Mueller and other probes posing risk for Trump
Flynn , dressed in a suit and tie , showed little emotion throughout the hearing , and spoke calmly when he confirmed his guilty plea and answered questions from the judge .
Sullivan appeared ready to sentence Flynn to prison but then gave him the option of a delay in his sentencing so he could fully cooperate with any pending investigations and bolster his case for leniency . The judge told Flynn he could not promise that he would not eventually sentence him to serve prison time .
Flynn accepted that offer . Sullivan did not set a new date for sentencing but asked Mueller ’ s team and Flynn ’ s attorney to give him a status report by March 13 .
Sullivan later imposed travel restrictions on Flynn , ordering him to surrender his passport and to obtain court permission before traveling outside the Washington area . The curbs are typical for people released on their own recognizance , the judge said .
Prosecutors said Flynn already had provided most of the cooperation he could , but it was possible he might be able to help investigators further . Flynn ’ s attorney said his client is cooperating with federal prosecutors in a case against Bijan Rafiekian , his former business partner who has been charged with unregistered lobbying for Turkey .
Rafiekian pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to those charges in federal court in Alexandria , Virginia . His trial is scheduled for Feb. 11 . Flynn is expected to testify .
Prosecutors have said Rafiekian and Flynn lobbied to have Washington extradite a Muslim cleric who lives in the United States and is accused by Turkey ’ s government of backing a 2016 coup attempt . Flynn has not been charged in that case .
Former U.S. national security adviser Michael Flynn departs after his sentencing was delayed at U.S. District Court in Washington , U.S. , December 18 , 2018 . ███/Joshua Roberts
Flynn was a high-profile adviser to Trump ’ s campaign team . At the Republican Party ’ s national convention in 2016 , Flynn led Trump ’ s supporters in cries of “ Lock her up ! ” directed against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton .
A group of protesters , including some who chanted “ Lock him up , ” gathered outside the courthouse on Tuesday , along with a large inflatable rat fashioned to look like Trump . Several Flynn supporters also were there , cheering as he entered and exited . One held a sign that read , “ Michael Flynn is a hero . ”
Flynn became national security adviser when Trump took office in January 2017 , but lasted only 24 days before being fired .
He told FBI investigators on Jan. 24 , 2017 , that he had not discussed the U.S. sanctions with Kislyak when in fact he had , according to his plea agreement . Trump has said he fired Flynn because he also lied to Vice President Mike Pence about the contacts with Kislyak .
Trump has said Flynn did not break the law and has voiced support for him , raising speculation the Republican president might pardon him .
“ Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn . Will be interesting to see what he has to say , despite tremendous pressure being put on him , about Russian Collusion in our great and , obviously , highly successful political campaign . There was no Collusion ! ” Trump wrote on Twitter on Tuesday morning .
After the hearing , White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters the FBI had “ ambushed ” Flynn in the way agents questioned him , but said his “ activities ” at the center of the case “ don ’ t have anything to do with the president ” and disputed that Flynn had committed treason .
In contrast , Trump has called his former long-time personal lawyer Michael Cohen , who has pleaded guilty to separate charges , a “ rat . ”
Mueller ’ s investigation into Russia ’ s role in the 2016 election and whether Trump has unlawfully sought to obstruct the probe has cast a shadow over his presidency . Several former Trump aides have pleaded guilty in Mueller ’ s probe , but Flynn was the first former Trump White House official to do so . Mueller also has charged a series of Russian individuals and entities .

Russia has denied meddling in the election , contrary to the conclusion of U.S. intelligence agencies that have said Moscow used hacking and propaganda to try to sow discord in the United States and boost Trump ’ s chances against Clinton .","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge fiercely criticized President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn on Tuesday for lying to FBI agents in a probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election, and delayed sentencing him until Flynn has finished helping prosecutors.

U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan told Flynn, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general and former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, that he had arguably betrayed his country. Sullivan also noted that Flynn had operated as an undeclared lobbyist for Turkey even as he worked on Trump’s campaign team and prepared to be his White House national security adviser.

Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about his December 2016 conversations with Sergei Kislyak, then Russia’s ambassador in Washington, about U.S. sanctions imposed on Moscow by the administration of Trump’s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama. The conversations took place between Trump’s November election victory and his inauguration in January 2017.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller, leading the investigation into possible collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia ahead of the election, had asked the judge not to sentence Flynn to prison because he had already provided “substantial” cooperation over the course of many interviews.

Lying to the FBI carries a statutory maximum sentence of five years in prison. Flynn’s plea agreement stated that he was eligible for a sentence of between zero and six months.

Sullivan sternly told Flynn his actions were abhorrent, noting that Flynn had also lied to senior White House officials, who in turn misled the public. The judge said he had read additional facts about Flynn’s behavior that have not been made public.

At one point, Sullivan asked prosecutors if Flynn could have been charged with treason, although the judge later said he had not been suggesting such a charge was warranted.

“Arguably, you sold your country out,” Sullivan told Flynn. “I’m not hiding my disgust, my disdain for this criminal offense.”

Flynn, dressed in a suit and tie, showed little emotion throughout the hearing, and spoke calmly when he confirmed his guilty plea and answered questions from the judge.

Sullivan appeared ready to sentence Flynn to prison but then gave him the option of a delay in his sentencing so he could fully cooperate with any pending investigations and bolster his case for leniency. The judge told Flynn he could not promise that he would not eventually sentence him to serve prison time.

Flynn accepted that offer. Sullivan did not set a new date for sentencing but asked Mueller’s team and Flynn’s attorney to give him a status report by March 13.

Sullivan later imposed travel restrictions on Flynn, ordering him to surrender his passport and to obtain court permission before traveling outside the Washington area. The curbs are typical for people released on their own recognizance, the judge said.

Prosecutors said Flynn already had provided most of the cooperation he could, but it was possible he might be able to help investigators further. Flynn’s attorney said his client is cooperating with federal prosecutors in a case against Bijan Rafiekian, his former business partner who has been charged with unregistered lobbying for Turkey.

Rafiekian pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to those charges in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia. His trial is scheduled for Feb. 11. Flynn is expected to testify.

Prosecutors have said Rafiekian and Flynn lobbied to have Washington extradite a Muslim cleric who lives in the United States and is accused by Turkey’s government of backing a 2016 coup attempt. Flynn has not been charged in that case.

‘LOCK HER UP!’

Flynn was a high-profile adviser to Trump’s campaign team. At the Republican Party’s national convention in 2016, Flynn led Trump’s supporters in cries of “Lock her up!” directed against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.

A group of protesters, including some who chanted “Lock him up,” gathered outside the courthouse on Tuesday, along with a large inflatable rat fashioned to look like Trump. Several Flynn supporters also were there, cheering as he entered and exited. One held a sign that read, “Michael Flynn is a hero.”

Flynn became national security adviser when Trump took office in January 2017, but lasted only 24 days before being fired.

He told FBI investigators on Jan. 24, 2017, that he had not discussed the U.S. sanctions with Kislyak when in fact he had, according to his plea agreement. Trump has said he fired Flynn because he also lied to Vice President Mike Pence about the contacts with Kislyak.

Trump has said Flynn did not break the law and has voiced support for him, raising speculation the Republican president might pardon him.

“Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn. Will be interesting to see what he has to say, despite tremendous pressure being put on him, about Russian Collusion in our great and, obviously, highly successful political campaign. There was no Collusion!” Trump wrote on Twitter on Tuesday morning.

After the hearing, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters the FBI had “ambushed” Flynn in the way agents questioned him, but said his “activities” at the center of the case “don’t have anything to do with the president” and disputed that Flynn had committed treason.

“We wish General Flynn well,” Sanders said.

In contrast, Trump has called his former long-time personal lawyer Michael Cohen, who has pleaded guilty to separate charges, a “rat.”

Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 election and whether Trump has unlawfully sought to obstruct the probe has cast a shadow over his presidency. Several former Trump aides have pleaded guilty in Mueller’s probe, but Flynn was the first former Trump White House official to do so. Mueller also has charged a series of Russian individuals and entities.

Trump has called Mueller’s investigation a “witch hunt” and has denied collusion with Moscow.

Schrier is now asking hard questions of former FBI Director Robert Mueller , who now leads the special counsel Russia probe , and former FBI Director James Comey , who was fired by President Trump in May 2017 .
`` Not every FBI agent is bad . Some are very good people , '' Schrier told Fox News . `` But the ones that are bad need to be weeded out . And the ones who let them be bad , and who turn their head , need to be exposed . ''
In an exclusive cable interview that first aired Monday on `` The Story '' with Martha MacCallum , Schrier went in depth , sharing emails , financial records and formal letters of complaint , which backed up allegations that after he was taken hostage in 2012 , the FBI monitored his accounts as Al Qaeda terrorists used his money to buy at least a dozen computers and tablets .
While he was tortured and held by al Nusra , the brutal Al Qaeda franchise in Syria , Schrier claimed the FBI put intelligence gathering ahead of his personal security , hoping to track the computers and tablets to learn more about Al Qaeda recruits and future plots . After his harrowing escape , Schrier started demanding answers from the FBI , which at the time of his kidnapping was led by Mueller .
Since his return to the U.S. in mid-2013 , Schrier shared documents with Fox News and explained , `` I faxed -- I emailed them , probably between my mother and my father and me , between 50 and 100 complaints . ''
Comey took over from Mueller in September 2013 , and Schrier said the stonewalling continued . `` I was emailing him questions . I was forwarding him all these emails . I was demanding answers from him , '' Schrier said . `` And I never got anything back . ''
Schrier said he has been unable to obtain credit cards or open new bank accounts because Al Qaeda stole his identity and passwords . Unable to get a lease for an apartment , Schrier said his FBI case manager suggested he temporarily live in a New York City homeless shelter .
`` I just got clean clothes without bed bugs . I do n't want to go through a situation where I have to deal with lice and bed bugs again . Like , no thank you . ''
The publisher for Comey 's upcoming book , `` A Higher Loyalty , '' did not immediately respond to Fox News ' questions . The Office of the Special Counsel referred Fox News to the FBI . The FBI did not dispute Schrier 's account . An FBI spokesperson said the bureau could neither respond to specific questions nor make the agent assigned to Schrier 's case available for an interview .
`` The FBI 's investigation into the kidnapping of Matthew Schrier remains open , therefore , we are not able to discuss investigative details surrounding this case . The FBI works closely with our federal partners not only to ensure that the U.S. Government does all that it can to safely recover Americans taken hostage overseas but to also assist victims who have been defrauded or further abused by a hostage-taker , '' the spokesperson said .
A leading group that helps American hostages and their families , Hostage US , confirmed 2012 and 2013 represented a dark period .
`` By the U.S. government 's own admission , there were many problems relating to their engagement with families around this time , mixed messages from different parts of government , '' Hostage US Executive Director Rachel Briggs told Fox News . `` President Obama ordered a review of the U.S. government 's handling of hostages ' cases in late 2014 , which ... led to a range of policy and procedural changes . The review came about largely because families themselves were vocal in their criticisms , and they should take the credit for the changes they brought about . ''
Briggs cited a new Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell -- a cross-government unit focused on hostage cases , as well as a Hostage Response Group at the National Security Council .
Schrier 's story began in 2012 when , as a freelance photographer , he traveled to Syria , one of the most dangerous places on the planet for journalists to operate . Schrier said he wanted to witness history .
`` I love military history and I 'm not really the type who wants to photograph handshakes . So I thought it would be a great experience witnessing history , photographing history , bringing it back , '' Schrier explained .
On New Year 's Eve of 2012 , instead of crossing back into Turkey , Schrier was kidnapped by the Al Qaeda franchise known as al Nusra . `` ISIS pushed them out , but at that time , they were number one , '' Schrier said . `` They were the guys you did not want to be held by . ''
Schrier spent the next seven months held in six prisons across Syria where he was routinely tortured and starved . `` They caught me trying to escape a month and six days in , so they put a tire around my knees and they lock it in place by sliding a bar in the crook between the tire and your knee -- the back of your knees . And they flip you over so your feet are in the air and you 're handcuffed ... And they take a cable ... about as thick as nightstick , and they whack your feet . ''
Six weeks after his disappearance , records reviewed by Fox News showed 10 computers were purchased using his accounts , after Schrier said his Al Qaeda kidnappers threatened him . `` They sat me down in the office in a circle with the emir , three Canadians and another guy . And they put a piece of paper in front of me and said , basically , 'Write down all the passwords for every account you have , from Facebook to your credit cards to your bank accounts , we want your social security number . ' ''
At least two tablets were shipped to a Canadian address . Fox News called phone numbers listed under the name and address but there was no response . A February 2017 email reviewed by Fox News from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police suggested a criminal case was being built , but there was no public evidence charges were pursued .
By February 2013 , Schrier said the terrorists had everything to steal his identity . `` They bought laptops , they bought tablets , they bought boots , you know , things to fight with . They practically rebuilt a Mercedes with parts . I mean , all sorts of stuff ... They bought a Kama Sutra guide . They bought sunglasses , cologne . ''
At the same time , Schrier claimed the FBI was monitoring the transactions , and the bureau 's point person for his family , agent Lindsey Perotti , misled his mother . Six months into his captivity , the FBI agent wrote Schrier 's mother , `` Everything at this point seems to indicate he is the one using his phone , credit card , and bank account . '' Despite working as a freelance war photographer , Schrier had not posted any new work .
`` I 'd been kept in the dark for extremely long periods of times , I 'm infested with bedbugs , '' Schrier said . `` Yet , according to the FBI , I 'm speaking to people on my cellphone , I 'm buying laptops and cologne and boots and sunglasses , maybe going into Turkey once in a while to get away from things , you know , just like all jihadis do , you know . 'Cause Southern Turkey 's like the Hamptons , you know ? ''
Schrier , from New York , hid the fact he was Jewish from his captors because he said it meant certain death .
Two intelligence officers , one current , the other former , told Fox News that Schrier 's theory -- that the FBI was tracking Al Qaeda 's online activity with his accounts , as well as the computer purchases -- suggested it was part of a larger operation .
`` So they 're monitoring my financial records straight off the bat . They 're letting them steal this money . Why are they letting them steal the money , what 's the angle ? Well , what are they buying ? They 're buying laptops and tablets . If they intercept them , they do their little spy thing and then they deliver them right into the hands of Al Qaeda and they create , basically , a dream come true for the intelligence community , a way to infiltrate the enemy like never before , without them even knowing it , '' Schrier said .
He claimed the FBI 's priority was running an intelligence operation and not an investigation to secure his release . Pressed by Fox News to back up the serious allegation , Schrier said , `` Beyond a reasonable doubt , I have all the evidence , I have made one attempt after another to have this investigated so that the people responsible can be held accountable , nobody will return my calls , nobody will investigate this , despite all the evidence . ''
Halfway through his captivity , by April 2013 , there was a conversation between FBI agent Perotti and a government official familiar with the case .
`` He 's like , 'Do you think that he joined them ? Like , what 's going on ? ' She 's like , 'No , no , no . We 're pretty sure he did n't join 'em based on his financial records . ' Boom , she slipped . She admitted she was monitoring my financial records as of early April , '' Schrier said .
A government official backed up the account to Fox News .
Nearly five years after a harrowing escape , Schrier documented his story in a new book , `` The Dawn Prayer . ''
The 39-year-old Schrier said he remained angry at how the FBI handled his case . `` You know , what I needed help with was reestablishing a life for myself , which means a new social security number and rebuilding my credit . ''
Schrier emphasized that he still could n't get a credit card though he was able eventuallly to recover more than $ 16,000 in stolen funds through PayPal and Citibank , but it took months . `` You have the Witness Protection Program , you give new social security numbers to murderers and pimps and drug dealers . I 'm a witness too and I did n't do any of that stuff . 'No -- ca n't help you . ' ''
After he returned , Schrier described a debrief for the FBI and CIA . The CIA had no comment for Fox News .
`` I gave them more information than probably 50 informants could 've given 'em . And that 's when I went from feeling like , 'All right , I do n't deserve anything , ' to , 'You know what , yeah , yeah I deserve some things . I deserve a new social security number , I deserve decent health care , I deserve to be treated with respect . ' I did n't ask for anything . I gave them Skype names , I gave them more than anyone in my situation has ever given them . I can say that definitively . And what I got in return was lies , betrayal , nothing , '' Schrier said .
An FBI spokesperson added , `` The FBI offers assistance to victims to aid them in rebuilding their lives . We continue to work with our interagency and international law enforcement partners to gather intelligence as well as assess the possibility of bringing charges against those who victimized Mr . Schrier .

""By the U.S. government's own admission, there were many problems relating to their engagement with families around this time, mixed messages from different parts of government,"" Hostage US Executive Director Rachel Briggs told Fox News. ""President Obama ordered a review of the U.S. government's handling of hostages' cases in late 2014, which... led to a range of policy and procedural changes. The review came about largely because families themselves were vocal in their criticisms, and they should take the credit for the changes they brought about.""

Briggs cited a new Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell -- a cross-government unit focused on hostage cases, as well as a Hostage Response Group at the National Security Council.

Schrier's story began in 2012 when, as a freelance photographer, he traveled to Syria, one of the most dangerous places on the planet for journalists to operate. Schrier said he wanted to witness history.

""I love military history and I'm not really the type who wants to photograph handshakes. So I thought it would be a great experience witnessing history, photographing history, bringing it back,"" Schrier explained.

On New Year's Eve of 2012, instead of crossing back into Turkey, Schrier was kidnapped by the Al Qaeda franchise known as al Nusra. ""ISIS pushed them out, but at that time, they were number one,"" Schrier said. ""They were the guys you did not want to be held by.""

Schrier spent the next seven months held in six prisons across Syria where he was routinely tortured and starved. ""They caught me trying to escape a month and six days in, so they put a tire around my knees and they lock it in place by sliding a bar in the crook between the tire and your knee -- the back of your knees. And they flip you over so your feet are in the air and you're handcuffed... And they take a cable... about as thick as nightstick, and they whack your feet.""

Six weeks after his disappearance, records reviewed by Fox News showed 10 computers were purchased using his accounts, after Schrier said his Al Qaeda kidnappers threatened him. ""They sat me down in the office in a circle with the emir, three Canadians and another guy. And they put a piece of paper in front of me and said, basically, 'Write down all the passwords for every account you have, from Facebook to your credit cards to your bank accounts, we want your social security number.'""

At least two tablets were shipped to a Canadian address. Fox News called phone numbers listed under the name and address but there was no response. A February 2017 email reviewed by Fox News from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police suggested a criminal case was being built, but there was no public evidence charges were pursued.

By February 2013, Schrier said the terrorists had everything to steal his identity. ""They bought laptops, they bought tablets, they bought boots, you know, things to fight with. They practically rebuilt a Mercedes with parts. I mean, all sorts of stuff... They bought a Kama Sutra guide. They bought sunglasses, cologne.""

At the same time, Schrier claimed the FBI was monitoring the transactions, and the bureau's point person for his family, agent Lindsey Perotti, misled his mother. Six months into his captivity, the FBI agent wrote Schrier's mother, ""Everything at this point seems to indicate he is the one using his phone, credit card, and bank account."" Despite working as a freelance war photographer, Schrier had not posted any new work.

""I'd been kept in the dark for extremely long periods of times, I'm infested with bedbugs,"" Schrier said. ""Yet, according to the FBI, I'm speaking to people on my cellphone, I'm buying laptops and cologne and boots and sunglasses, maybe going into Turkey once in a while to get away from things, you know, just like all jihadis do, you know. 'Cause Southern Turkey's like the Hamptons, you know?""

Schrier, from New York, hid the fact he was Jewish from his captors because he said it meant certain death.

Two intelligence officers, one current, the other former, told Fox News that Schrier's theory -- that the FBI was tracking Al Qaeda's online activity with his accounts, as well as the computer purchases -- suggested it was part of a larger operation.

""So they're monitoring my financial records straight off the bat. They're letting them steal this money. Why are they letting them steal the money, what's the angle? Well, what are they buying? They're buying laptops and tablets. If they intercept them, they do their little spy thing and then they deliver them right into the hands of Al Qaeda and they create, basically, a dream come true for the intelligence community, a way to infiltrate the enemy like never before, without them even knowing it,"" Schrier said.

He claimed the FBI's priority was running an intelligence operation and not an investigation to secure his release. Pressed by Fox News to back up the serious allegation, Schrier said, ""Beyond a reasonable doubt, I have all the evidence, I have made one attempt after another to have this investigated so that the people responsible can be held accountable, nobody will return my calls, nobody will investigate this, despite all the evidence.""

Halfway through his captivity, by April 2013, there was a conversation between FBI agent Perotti and a government official familiar with the case.

""He's like, 'Do you think that he joined them? Like, what's going on?' She's like, 'No, no, no. We're pretty sure he didn't join 'em based on his financial records.' Boom, she slipped. She admitted she was monitoring my financial records as of early April,"" Schrier said.

A government official backed up the account to Fox News.

Nearly five years after a harrowing escape, Schrier documented his story in a new book, ""The Dawn Prayer.""

The 39-year-old Schrier said he remained angry at how the FBI handled his case. ""You know, what I needed help with was reestablishing a life for myself, which means a new social security number and rebuilding my credit.""

Schrier emphasized that he still couldn't get a credit card though he was able eventuallly to recover more than $16,000 in stolen funds through PayPal and Citibank, but it took months. ""You have the Witness Protection Program, you give new social security numbers to murderers and pimps and drug dealers. I'm a witness too and I didn't do any of that stuff. 'No -- can't help you.'""

After he returned, Schrier described a debrief for the FBI and CIA. The CIA had no comment for Fox News.

""I gave them more information than probably 50 informants could've given 'em. And that's when I went from feeling like, 'All right, I don't deserve anything,' to, 'You know what, yeah, yeah I deserve some things. I deserve a new social security number, I deserve decent health care, I deserve to be treated with respect.' I didn't ask for anything. I gave them Skype names, I gave them more than anyone in my situation has ever given them. I can say that definitively. And what I got in return was lies, betrayal, nothing,"" Schrier said.

An FBI spokesperson added, ""The FBI offers assistance to victims to aid them in rebuilding their lives. We continue to work with our interagency and international law enforcement partners to gather intelligence as well as assess the possibility of bringing charges against those who victimized Mr. Schrier.""",www.foxnews.com,right,YH9IFDasBgWl99vm

Justice Department Now Says It Doesn’t Care.,2020-05-07,Spencer Ackerman,"It may not be a pardon . But the Justice Department has dropped charges against Donald Trump ’ s former national security adviser Michael Flynn , who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI .
Retired Army Lt. Gen. Flynn , an important figure in the war on terror who gave Trump ’ s 2016 run military validation , will avoid prison time after the Justice Department provided a deliverance on Thursday that Flynn had long sought . It is also the second redemption that Trump has provided the general , who served as his first national security adviser for less than a month .
“ The Government has determined , pursuant to the Principles of Federal Prosecution and based on an extensive review and careful consideration of the circumstances , that continued prosecution of this case would not serve the interests of justice , ” wrote Timothy Shea , the interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia and a former senior aide to Attorney General William Barr . Shortly before the filing , lead prosecutor Brandon Von Grack abruptly withdrew from the case .
The Justice Department filing , in essence , portrays Flynn as the victim of an FBI frame-up job , and his lies to the FBI as legally marginal . Shea wrote that Flynn ’ s lies needed to have been “ not simply false , but ‘ materially ’ false with respect to a matter under investigation. ” Later in the filing , Shea referred to those lies as “ gaps in [ Flynn ’ s ] memory , ” rather than deliberate falsehoods Flynn conceded .
“ Even if he told the truth , Mr. Flynn ’ s statements could not have conceivably ‘ influenced ’ an investigation that had neither a legitimate counterintelligence nor criminal purpose , ” Shea wrote .
It was an astonishing turnaround since 2018 , when a federal judge said to Flynn in a sentencing hearing , “ arguably , you sold your country out. ” That judge , Emmet Sullivan , could still decide to reject Shea ’ s filing and continue with Flynn ’ sentencing . Michael Bromwich , a former federal prosecutor and Justice Department inspector general , tweeted that the extraordinary move represented “ a pardon by another name ” and called it a “ black day in DOJ history . ”
Rep. Jerrold Nadler ( D-NY ) , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , said the decision to drop charges was “ outrageous ” and revealed “ a politicized and thoroughly corrupt Department of Justice. ” Sen. Ron Wyden ( D-OR ) added , “ If Barr ’ s Justice Department will drop charges against someone who twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and who the White House publicly fired for lying to the vice president , there ’ s nothing it won ’ t do , no investigation it won ’ t taint . ”
Neither Flynn nor his attorney , Sidney Powell , responded immediately to requests for comment .
Speaking to reports on Thursday afternoon , Trump said he had no prior knowledge of the Justice Department ’ s decision . “ He was an innocent man , ” Trump said , of Flynn . “ Now in my book he ’ s an even greater warrior . ”
The dropped charges follow a years-long groundswell from Trump ’ s base , and particularly Fox News , to clear Flynn . His advocates claim that Flynn was set up by the same disreputable FBI figures who they believe persecuted Trump over phantom collusion with Russia .
Flynn ’ s guilty plea , in December , 2017 , has been no obstacle to the narrative , particularly since Flynn sought afterwards , unsuccessfully , to withdraw his plea . His sentencing , initially set for February , had also been delayed .
Last month , agitation for a Flynn pardon intensified after documents emerged from two of Trump ’ s most hated ex-FBI figures , counterintelligence official Peter Strzok and attorney Lisa Page , discussing Flynn ’ s fateful January 2017 interview with the FBI . Page asked when and how to “ slip it in ” to Flynn that lying to an FBI agent is a crime , something that Flynn ’ s advocates believed showed the general being railroaded from the start .
But veteran FBI agents and prosecutors have pointed out that the FBI is not legally obligated to inform an interview subject that lying to them is illegal . “ Michael Flynn was very familiar with the FBI , ” said Stephanie Douglas , a former executive assistant director of the FBI ’ s National Security Branch . “ He would certainly have been aware of his obligation to provide candid and truthful information . His claim he was tricked and manipulated doesn ’ t sound valid to me . ”
Shea , in his Thursday court filing , suggested the FBI officials were “ fishing for falsehoods merely to manufacture jurisdiction over any statement. ” In Shea ’ s view , Flynn ’ s lies were less germane to the prosecution than the FBI “ lack [ ing ] sufficient basis to sustain its initial counterintelligence investigation , ” and its pre-interview position that it ought to close the investigation before speaking with the then national security adviser .
Former FBI deputy head Andrew McCabe said on Thursday that the suggestion there was no reason to interview Flynn was “ patently false , and ignores the considerable national security risk his contacts raised. ” He said Flynn ’ s lies added to the FBI ’ s concerns about his relationship with Russia . “ Today ’ s move ... is pure politics designed to please the president , ” he added .
U.S. Attorney Jeff Jensen , who was appointed by Barr to review Flynn ’ s and other high-profile cases , said on Thursday that he concluded “ the proper and just course ” was to dismiss the case . “ I briefed Attorney General Barr on my findings , advised him on these conclusions , and he agreed , ” he said .
While serving as national security adviser , Flynn misled FBI interviewers about conversations he had with the then-Russian ambassador , Sergei Kislyak . In one of those late 2016 conversations , according to court filings , Flynn asked the Russians to avoid escalatory actions in response to sanctions and diplomatic expulsions then President Barack Obama enacted as reprisal for Russian electoral interference . Shea , in his filing , called Flynn ’ s Kislyak calls “ entirely appropriate on their face . ”
The national security adviser ’ s lies prompted the holdover attorney general , Sally Yates , to warn the White House that Flynn had given the Russians leverage to blackmail him . But it would take weeks before Trump fired Flynn over “ an eroding level of trust ” concerning misleading Vice President Mike Pence on the Kislyak contacts . By May , Trump was said to have regretted dismissing the general .
Flynn in 2017 agreed to cooperate with Special Counsel Robert Mueller ’ s investigation . The general avoided charges for taking $ 530,000 in unregistered money from interests connected to the Turkish government—something he only declared with the Justice Department after his downfall as national security adviser .
During a sentencing hearing in 2018 , a federal judge castigated Flynn for disgracing the uniform Flynn wore for three decades . “ Arguably , you sold your country out , ” Judge Emmet Sullivan said . Two years earlier , on stage at the Republican national convention , Flynn had led a chant of “ lock her up ” about Hillary Clinton . Protesters outside Flynn ’ s courtroom did not let the general forget it .
Trump ’ s enduring bond with Flynn is a testament to the importance of the role the general played in 2016 .
A host of national security officials , many aligned with the Republican Party , rejected Trump in 2016 as unfit to be president owing to his nativism , his penchant for brutality and his benign view of dictators like Russia ’ s Vladimir Putin . Flynn was the exception . And the general was an exceptional figure . As the intelligence chief for the Joint Special Operations Command during the mid-2000s , Flynn is one of a select few people who can be said to have personally prosecuted the most sensitive missions of the war on terror .
It was a pivotal credential in another way . Flynn emerged from the war on terror endorsing Trump ’ s view that the security apparatus , abetted by hidebound liberals and cowardly conservatives , had neutered the war on terror by refusing to see it was a civilizational conflict with Islam . “ Islam is a political ideology ” that “ hides behind this notion of being a religion , ” Flynn told the Islamophobic group ACT for America shortly after the 2016 convention . His hostility to Islam informed his sanguine view of Russia , which both Flynn and Trump saw as naturally aligned with the U.S. against what they called “ Radical Islamic Terror . ”
It also meant that Trump and Flynn shared a common bureaucratic enemy . James Clapper , then the director of national intelligence , was a lead architect of an intelligence assessment finding Russia intervened in the election on Trump ’ s behalf . In 2014 , Clapper fired Flynn as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency . It was deeply embittering . Just four years earlier , Flynn had been hailed as an innovator after claiming U.S. military intelligence had misunderstood the Afghanistan war .
While Flynn portrayed himself as a martyr , victimized by the ‘ Deep State ’ for daring to warn about radical Islam , Clapper and other intelligence leaders had fallen out with Flynn over what they considered an incompetent management style and an iffy relationship with the truth . Reportedly , Flynn believed Iran was involved in the 2012 assault on a CIA compound in Benghazi that killed four Americans , and claimed incorrectly that Iran was responsible for more American deaths than al-Qaeda . Aides referred to such untruths as “ Flynn facts . ”
Flynn facts did not disturb Trump . They validated his instincts on national security . Trump rewarded Flynn by making him national security adviser , one of the most important positions in the U.S. security apparatus . It was the first time Trump redeemed Flynn . Thursday ’ s dropped charges represent the second .","It may not be a pardon.

Former FBI deputy head Andrew McCabe said on Thursday that the suggestion there was no reason to interview Flynn was “patently false, and ignores the considerable national security risk his contacts raised.” He said Flynn’s lies added to the FBI’s concerns about his relationship with Russia. “Today’s move... is pure politics designed to please the president,” he added.

U.S. Attorney Jeff Jensen, who was appointed by Barr to review Flynn’s and other high-profile cases, said on Thursday that he concluded “the proper and just course” was to dismiss the case. “I briefed Attorney General Barr on my findings, advised him on these conclusions, and he agreed,” he said.

While serving as national security adviser, Flynn misled FBI interviewers about conversations he had with the then-Russian ambassador, Sergei Kislyak. In one of those late 2016 conversations, according to court filings, Flynn asked the Russians to avoid escalatory actions in response to sanctions and diplomatic expulsions then President Barack Obama enacted as reprisal for Russian electoral interference. Shea, in his filing, called Flynn’s Kislyak calls “entirely appropriate on their face.”

The national security adviser’s lies prompted the holdover attorney general, Sally Yates, to warn the White House that Flynn had given the Russians leverage to blackmail him. But it would take weeks before Trump fired Flynn over “an eroding level of trust” concerning misleading Vice President Mike Pence on the Kislyak contacts. By May, Trump was said to have regretted dismissing the general.

Flynn in 2017 agreed to cooperate with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. The general avoided charges for taking $530,000 in unregistered money from interests connected to the Turkish government—something he only declared with the Justice Department after his downfall as national security adviser.

During a sentencing hearing in 2018, a federal judge castigated Flynn for disgracing the uniform Flynn wore for three decades. “Arguably, you sold your country out,” Judge Emmet Sullivan said. Two years earlier, on stage at the Republican national convention, Flynn had led a chant of “lock her up” about Hillary Clinton. Protesters outside Flynn’s courtroom did not let the general forget it.

Trump’s enduring bond with Flynn is a testament to the importance of the role the general played in 2016.

A host of national security officials, many aligned with the Republican Party, rejected Trump in 2016 as unfit to be president owing to his nativism, his penchant for brutality and his benign view of dictators like Russia’s Vladimir Putin. Flynn was the exception. And the general was an exceptional figure. As the intelligence chief for the Joint Special Operations Command during the mid-2000s, Flynn is one of a select few people who can be said to have personally prosecuted the most sensitive missions of the war on terror.

It was a pivotal credential in another way. Flynn emerged from the war on terror endorsing Trump’s view that the security apparatus, abetted by hidebound liberals and cowardly conservatives, had neutered the war on terror by refusing to see it was a civilizational conflict with Islam. “Islam is a political ideology” that “hides behind this notion of being a religion,” Flynn told the Islamophobic group ACT for America shortly after the 2016 convention. His hostility to Islam informed his sanguine view of Russia, which both Flynn and Trump saw as naturally aligned with the U.S. against what they called “Radical Islamic Terror.”

It also meant that Trump and Flynn shared a common bureaucratic enemy. James Clapper, then the director of national intelligence, was a lead architect of an intelligence assessment finding Russia intervened in the election on Trump’s behalf. In 2014, Clapper fired Flynn as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. It was deeply embittering. Just four years earlier, Flynn had been hailed as an innovator after claiming U.S. military intelligence had misunderstood the Afghanistan war.

While Flynn portrayed himself as a martyr, victimized by the ‘Deep State’ for daring to warn about radical Islam, Clapper and other intelligence leaders had fallen out with Flynn over what they considered an incompetent management style and an iffy relationship with the truth. Reportedly, Flynn believed Iran was involved in the 2012 assault on a CIA compound in Benghazi that killed four Americans, and claimed incorrectly that Iran was responsible for more American deaths than al-Qaeda. Aides referred to such untruths as “Flynn facts.”

Flynn facts did not disturb Trump. They validated his instincts on national security. Trump rewarded Flynn by making him national security adviser, one of the most important positions in the U.S. security apparatus. It was the first time Trump redeemed Flynn.

The president would have been better off to say nothing at all.

Excerpts from James Comey’s new book were released Thursday night — and from the looks of it, the former FBI director made the decision get petty in his descriptions of Donald Trump.

For example, this:

His face appeared slightly orange with bright white half-moons under his eyes where I assumed he placed small tanning goggles, and impressively coifed, bright blond hair, which upon close inspection looked to be all his. . . . As he extended his hand, I made a mental note to check its size. It was smaller than mine, but did not seem unusually so.

James Comey is supposed to be a former FBI director, not a high-school bully, and the tanning and tiny-hands comments sound a lot more like something from the latter from than the former. If Comey really wanted the book to be taken seriously, he’d have been better off avoiding this passage (as well as, for example, another passage where he refers to the “soft white pouches” under Trump’s “expressionless blue eyes.”)

What difference does President Trump’s appearance make in any of this? None, and childish attacks make the author look, well, childish — which is not a description you should want to apply to you when you’re making the kinds of serious allegations that Comey makes elsewhere in the book.

Think about it: Right after Comey makes the comments about the “soft white pouches” and “expressionless blue eyes,” he writes: “I remember thinking in that moment that the president doesn’t understand the FBI’s role in American life.” That’s a pretty serious charge, and you think you’d want to do all you could to build your credibility as a witness before making it. Preceding it with unnecessary attacks on Trump’s appearance, however, makes Comey look more like a disgruntled former employee — hell-bent on slamming the president however he can — than an unbiased narrator.

The ranking Democrat on the panel , Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California , highlighted Horowitz ’ s finding that the FBI had a legitimate basis to open the investigation into the Trump campaign in July 2016 . She said that conclusion undercut Trump ’ s repeated claims that he was the target of a vendetta by FBI officials .
“ This was not a politically-motivated investigation . There is no ‘ Deep State , ’ ” Feinstein said . “ Simply put , the FBI investigation was motivated by fact , not bias . … The FBI was obligated to investigate possible Russian ties to the Trump campaign . ”
Feinstein also faulted Barr for continuing to claim publicly that it is possible the FBI ’ s Russia probe was tainted by political motivations .
“ I believe strongly that it ’ s time to move on from the false claims of political bias , ” she said .
Democrats downplayed the numerous failures detailed in Horowitz ’ s 400-plus-page report and pointed out that FBI Director Christopher Wray had promised to address them .

Wray has agreed not to do that again — at least with briefings to a presidential nominee ’ s campaign . But not every senator agreed that the FBI tactic the bureau deployed in 2016 was outrageous .
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse ( D-R.I. ) noted that Michael Flynn , a key Trump adviser , was at the time a focus of a counterintelligence investigation by the FBI . He later pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI while serving as national security adviser in the White House and is awaiting sentencing .
“ It was an unusual circumstance that a participant in that briefing on the part of the Trump campaign was the subject of an FBI investigation , ” Whitehouse said . “ We should not draw the conclusion that there ’ s no way that the FBI should ever be given access to evidence that arises in the course of an intelligence briefing . ”
Graham used a sizable chunk of his lengthy opening statement to read anti-Trump text messages exchanged by a top FBI agent on the Russia probe , Peter Strzok , and an FBI attorney , Lisa Page . The South Carolina Republican said the messages were improper for anyone involved in such a probe , though the report notes that neither Strzok nor Page were in charge of the investigation .
Graham did not mention that the inspector general found pro-Trump texts sent by other agents dealing with the Russia probe , nor did the senator revisit his own cutting criticism of Trump during the 2016 campaign .
Graham faulted the FBI for assigning agents and lawyers who had strong views about Trump to the Russia investigation . He did not explain how FBI supervisors should have known about the political leanings of those involved , given legal prohibitions on using political views in staffing decisions .
Comey has claimed that the report ’ s finding vindicates him against claims of mounting a biased , unjustified investigation , but in response to a question from Graham , Horowitz said the part of the probe that focused on Page is something no one at the FBI should be proud of .
“ I think the activities we found here don ’ t vindicate anybody who touched this FISA , ” the inspector general said .
Despite the partisan divide evident at the hearing , there was some consensus that the inspector general ’ s findings could complicate the process for renewing certain surveillance authorities that recently got a short-term extension set to expire next March .
Graham said he ’ d been too quick in the past to dismiss warnings from colleagues such as Sen. Mike Lee ( R-Utah ) that FISA oversight was weak and the system was susceptible to abuse .
Lee opened his comments on Wednesday by slamming what he called Democrats ’ “ absolutely crazy ” take on the new report , but went on to say the findings demonstrated that his predictions about the surveillance regime had proven prescient .
“ It calls into question the legitimacy of the whole FISA program , ” Lee said . “ This really pushes us over the edge . … Every American really should be terrified by this report . ”
Another longtime critic of that surveillance process , Sen. Dick Durbin ( D-Ill. ) , pointed to the long history of inaccurate claims and broken promises by the government to the secretive court . He went on to say that he welcomed the new skepticism from some Republicans about those powers .
“ Let ’ s have a fulsome conversation after this about the future of the FISA court and the representations that are made to it , ” Durbin said .","Graham was also critical of the FBI’s decision to send an agent working on the Crossfire Hurricane investigation, as the Russia probe was named internally, to a more generic defensive briefing the bureau did for the Trump campaign.

Graham used a sizable chunk of his lengthy opening statement to read anti-Trump text messages exchanged by a top FBI agent on the Russia probe, Peter Strzok, and an FBI attorney, Lisa Page. The South Carolina Republican said the messages were improper for anyone involved in such a probe, though the report notes that neither Strzok nor Page were in charge of the investigation.

Graham did not mention that the inspector general found pro-Trump texts sent by other agents dealing with the Russia probe, nor did the senator revisit his own cutting criticism of Trump during the 2016 campaign.

Graham faulted the FBI for assigning agents and lawyers who had strong views about Trump to the Russia investigation. He did not explain how FBI supervisors should have known about the political leanings of those involved, given legal prohibitions on using political views in staffing decisions.

Comey has claimed that the report’s finding vindicates him against claims of mounting a biased, unjustified investigation, but in response to a question from Graham, Horowitz said the part of the probe that focused on Page is something no one at the FBI should be proud of.

“I think the activities we found here don’t vindicate anybody who touched this FISA,” the inspector general said.

Despite the partisan divide evident at the hearing, there was some consensus that the inspector general’s findings could complicate the process for renewing certain surveillance authorities that recently got a short-term extension set to expire next March.

Graham said he’d been too quick in the past to dismiss warnings from colleagues such as Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) that FISA oversight was weak and the system was susceptible to abuse.

Lee opened his comments on Wednesday by slamming what he called Democrats’ “absolutely crazy” take on the new report, but went on to say the findings demonstrated that his predictions about the surveillance regime had proven prescient.

“It calls into question the legitimacy of the whole FISA program,” Lee said. “This really pushes us over the edge. … Every American really should be terrified by this report.”

Another longtime critic of that surveillance process, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), pointed to the long history of inaccurate claims and broken promises by the government to the secretive court. He went on to say that he welcomed the new skepticism from some Republicans about those powers.

“Let’s have a fulsome conversation after this about the future of the FISA court and the representations that are made to it,” Durbin said.

WASHINGTON — Christopher Wray is that rare kind of government figure not easily driven to hyperbole.

Yet Friday’s swift resolution of a serial bombing campaign had even the plain spoken FBI director invoking Hollywood and taut television drama as he explained how federal authorities identified and captured a 56-year-old Florida man as its lone suspect in a series of partisan attacks that transfixed the nation for most of the week.

The fortunate break investigators were searching for, Wray said, arrived sometime Wednesday at the FBI Laboratory in Quantico, Va., with the first two of the 13 un-exploded devices to be delivered for analysis.

In short order, the devices — one addressed to President Barack Obama and the other to Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., — were turned over to bomb technicians and analysts who made a crucial discovery. On the padded manila envelope containing the device destined for Waters was a fingerprint.

By Thursday, investigators had matched the single print to a man with a lengthy criminal record in Florida, Cesar Sayoc. The link was enough to instill confidence that a resolution was near, but there was more.

Further examination of both the Waters and Obama devices revealed DNA among the components of the pipe-bombs, crudely constructed of six-inch PVC cylinders, small timers, batteries, wiring and ""energetic material.""

Late Thursday night, Wray said, federal investigators called on colleagues from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to compare the recovered DNA with existing samples taken from Sayoc in previous criminal cases.

Another match.

And federal authorities — just four days after the first device was found at the New York home of billionaire philanthropist and Democratic contributor George Soros — were ready to move in.

""This is phenomenal work, with the greatest pressure, under an incredibly tight time frame,"" Wray said at a Friday Justice Department briefing. ""We see unbelievable work like this on TV shows and in Hollywood, but to see it up close, in reality, is something to behold.""

For Wray and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who have been the frequent targets of blistering criticism from President Donald Trump, the quick settlement of such a disturbing case was not lost in the moment.

""This is a demonstration of the skill, the capability and determination of our American law enforcement,"" Sessions said Friday.

Whatever you do, never fire the FBI director.

It’s too early to take away any clear lessons from the Trump era, except one: Whatever you do, never fire the FBI director.

Yes, as president, it is fully within your power to cashier inferior executive-branch officers. But if the aftermath of the James Comey firing is any indication, it risks backlash from FBI and Justice Department officials who will take umbrage — and extraordinary steps in response.

This is the upshot of the 60 Minutes interview of former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. The Comey firing was ham-fisted and unsettling given the ongoing investigation of Russian interference into the 2016 election. But what ensued was an embarrassing freakout by law-enforcement officials entrusted with awesome powers.

Then the president can contest the declaration, also in writing, to the Senate and the House. If the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet still say he can’t serve, Congress has 21 days to vote on the question. If two-thirds of both houses says he can’t, the vice president remains acting president.

Anyone who believes that this was a remotely plausible or appropriate means to depose Donald Trump should have his own ability to discharge his duties examined.

First of all, Trump obviously was perfectly capable of discharging his duties; he just discharged them in a way alarming to McCabe and Rosenstein. His response to an effort by his Cabinet to join such an exercise would have been to fire anyone involved, which he could have done because, again, he wasn’t incapacitated.

""I think we definitely jumped the gun,"" David Kennedy, CEO of information security firm TrustedSec, told FoxNews.com on Friday. ""A lot of [the evidence is] very circumstantial.""

Kennedy, who testified on Capitol Hill last year on security concerns with HealthCare.gov, said he still believes an angry insider at Sony was behind it.

""They were going for destroying the company,"" he said.

As a caveat, the bureau noted it could not share all the evidence it has. This leaves open the possibility that the FBI is sitting on a smoking-gun piece of evidence that links the hack to Pyongyang beyond the shadow of a digital doubt.

The evidence the FBI did share was this:

The FBI observed ""significant overlap between the infrastructure used in this attack and other malicious cyber activity"" previously linked to North Korea, like North Korea-tied IP addresses that allegedly communicated with IP addresses tied to the Sony attack.

Bush . | AP Photo Trump taps Christopher Wray to head FBI Wray served as an assistant attorney general from 2003 to 2005 and acted as Chris Christie ’ s personal attorney during the Bridgegate scandal .
President Donald Trump will nominate Christopher Wray as the next director of the FBI , he announced on Twitter on Wednesday , the day before ousted FBI Director James Comey is to testify at a high-stakes Senate hearing .
“ I will be nominating Christopher A. Wray , a man of impeccable credentials , to be the new Director of the FBI . Details to follow , ” the president wrote .
Wray served as an assistant attorney general from 2003 to 2005 during the tenure of former President George W. Bush . He currently is a partner at the King & Spalding law firm , where he chairs its special matters and government investigations practice group .
At the Justice Department , Wray was the assistant attorney general in charge of the department ’ s criminal division , having been unanimously confirmed to that post by the Senate . He was a member of Bush ’ s corporate fraud task force and led the task force charged with investigating the Enron scandal .
More recently , Wray acted as New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie ’ s personal attorney during the federal investigation into lane closures leading to the George Washington Bridge that were put in place by members of Christie ’ s administration as political retribution for a mayor who did not support Christie ’ s reelection campaign .
“ I am proud to announce Christopher as my choice as the director of the FBI , ” Trump said in a statement released by the White House more than five hours after the announcement on Twitter . “ He is an impeccably qualified individual , and I know that he will again serve his country as a fierce guardian of the law and model of integrity once the Senate confirms him to lead the FBI . ”
“ It is a great honor to be selected by the president to return to the Department of Justice as director of the FBI , ” Wray said in the White House ’ s emailed statement . “ I look forward to serving the American people with integrity as the leader of what I know firsthand to be an extraordinary group of men and women who have dedicated their careers to protecting this country . ”

Trump had been in search of a new FBI director since last month , when he fired Comey . The White House ’ s initial explanation for the surprise firing centered around a recommendation from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , who pilloried the director ’ s unusually public handling of the bureau ’ s investigation into the personal email server maintained by Hillary Clinton during her tenure as secretary of state .
But Trump undercut that explanation days later in an interview with NBC News in which he said he had already made up his mind to fire Comey before meeting with Rosenstein and that he had made the decision with the bureau ’ s ongoing Russia investigation on his mind .
The news of Wray ’ s forthcoming nomination came as a surprise to some powerful senators . Both the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , Sen. Chuck Grassley ( R-Iowa ) , and the committee ’ s ranking Democrat , California Sen. Dianne Feinstein , said they had not been given advance notification from the White House of Wray ’ s nomination , even though their committee will handle his confirmation hearing . The Justice Department began circulating a bulleted list of “ fast facts ” about Wray around 9:30 a.m. Wednesday , a little less than two hours after Trump made his announcement on Twitter .
“ My impressions are that he ’ s qualified , certainly that he has the credentials , he has a history with the department , ” Feinstein said . “ I don ’ t know that he has any national security credentials , but I don ’ t think that ’ s as important as being a good administrator , a good manager and being able to run a department that has more than 30,000 employees . ”
At least one Senate Democrat — Jeff Merkley of Oregon — quickly went on the attack against Wray , questioning whether the nominee could exercise true independence from the man who nominated him .
Noting that Wray represented Christie during the so-called Bridgegate scandal , is a Republican donor and that his firm “ represents Trump Trust and Russian oil , ” Merkley tweeted : “ Wray doesn ’ t pass the test. ” A DOJ official said that during his time in private practice , Wray never worked on any issue involving Trump ’ s business holdings .
The first time Trump and Wray met was on May 30 in a meeting announced by the White House , according to the DOJ official .
Multiple Democratic senators told ███ on Wednesday that they want more time to look into Wray ’ s record before weighing in definitively . Most did not offer immediate criticism after quickly aligning against their former colleague Joe Lieberman , an early front-runner for Trump ’ s FBI nod .
“ I ’ ve had people that I know who give him high marks , ” said Virginia Sen. Mark Warner , the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee . “ But I ’ d like to do a little due diligence first . ”
Asked about Wray ’ s ties to Christie , Sen. Robert Menendez ( D-N.J. ) said : “ I don ’ t know that anyone who ’ s ever associated with anybody in the campaign is necessarily automatically disqualified . ”
“ I think he has solid experience and expertise , ” Sen. Richard Blumenthal ( D-Conn. ) said in an interview . “ He needs to have , as well , the independence and guts to stand up to political pressure , which seems all too common in this administration . ”
Sen. Heidi Heitkamp ( D-N.D. ) said she knows “ nothing about ” Wray but praised “ the fact that he ’ s not a politician ” and “ the fact that he ’ s been a prosecutor . We ’ ll wait to see what law enforcement ’ s reaction is . Obviously , the big concern is independence . Is he somebody who is going to act independent of this administration ? ”
Sen. Chris Murphy ( D-Conn. ) said he has “ heard some people I trust say nice things about him this morning , but I don ’ t know enough about him to have an opinion . ”
Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin ( D-Ill. ) said he would look at Wray ’ s record “ very carefully ” but had heard a “ positive response ” from Sen. Amy Klobuchar ( D-Minn. ) , who does know the prospective nominee .
Wray must show that he has “ the strength of character to stand up to ” any administration official “ who tries to divert a legitimate criminal investigation , ” Durbin added .
In a statement , Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday called Wray “ an extraordinary person ” with “ outstanding accomplishments and a proven record of public service. ” He lauded Wray ’ s past work as a U.S. attorney and his service at the Justice Department , especially in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , when Wray was the principal associate deputy attorney general .
“ Chris combines a brilliant legal mind , outstanding accomplishments , and a proven record of public service . We are fortunate that he is willing to make this personal commitment to serve his country at this important time , ” Sessions said in a statement . “ The President asked us to look for an FBI Director who has integrity , who understands and is committed to the rule of law , and who is dedicated to protecting the American people from crime , gangs , and terrorists . We have found our man in Chris Wray . ”

President Donald Trump will nominate Christopher Wray as the next director of the FBI, he announced on Twitter on Wednesday, the day before ousted FBI Director James Comey is to testify at a high-stakes Senate hearing.

“I will be nominating Christopher A. Wray, a man of impeccable credentials, to be the new Director of the FBI. Details to follow,” the president wrote.

Wray served as an assistant attorney general from 2003 to 2005 during the tenure of former President George W. Bush. He currently is a partner at the King & Spalding law firm, where he chairs its special matters and government investigations practice group.

At the Justice Department, Wray was the assistant attorney general in charge of the department’s criminal division, having been unanimously confirmed to that post by the Senate. He was a member of Bush’s corporate fraud task force and led the task force charged with investigating the Enron scandal.

More recently, Wray acted as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s personal attorney during the federal investigation into lane closures leading to the George Washington Bridge that were put in place by members of Christie’s administration as political retribution for a mayor who did not support Christie’s reelection campaign.

“I am proud to announce Christopher as my choice as the director of the FBI,” Trump said in a statement released by the White House more than five hours after the announcement on Twitter. “He is an impeccably qualified individual, and I know that he will again serve his country as a fierce guardian of the law and model of integrity once the Senate confirms him to lead the FBI.”

“It is a great honor to be selected by the president to return to the Department of Justice as director of the FBI,” Wray said in the White House’s emailed statement. “I look forward to serving the American people with integrity as the leader of what I know firsthand to be an extraordinary group of men and women who have dedicated their careers to protecting this country.”

Trump had been in search of a new FBI director since last month, when he fired Comey. The White House’s initial explanation for the surprise firing centered around a recommendation from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who pilloried the director’s unusually public handling of the bureau’s investigation into the personal email server maintained by Hillary Clinton during her tenure as secretary of state.

But Trump undercut that explanation days later in an interview with NBC News in which he said he had already made up his mind to fire Comey before meeting with Rosenstein and that he had made the decision with the bureau’s ongoing Russia investigation on his mind.

The news of Wray’s forthcoming nomination came as a surprise to some powerful senators. Both the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), and the committee’s ranking Democrat, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, said they had not been given advance notification from the White House of Wray’s nomination, even though their committee will handle his confirmation hearing. The Justice Department began circulating a bulleted list of “fast facts” about Wray around 9:30 a.m. Wednesday, a little less than two hours after Trump made his announcement on Twitter.

“My impressions are that he’s qualified, certainly that he has the credentials, he has a history with the department,” Feinstein said. “I don’t know that he has any national security credentials, but I don’t think that’s as important as being a good administrator, a good manager and being able to run a department that has more than 30,000 employees.”

At least one Senate Democrat — Jeff Merkley of Oregon — quickly went on the attack against Wray, questioning whether the nominee could exercise true independence from the man who nominated him.

Noting that Wray represented Christie during the so-called Bridgegate scandal, is a Republican donor and that his firm “represents Trump Trust and Russian oil,” Merkley tweeted: “Wray doesn’t pass the test.” A DOJ official said that during his time in private practice, Wray never worked on any issue involving Trump’s business holdings.

The first time Trump and Wray met was on May 30 in a meeting announced by the White House, according to the DOJ official.

Multiple Democratic senators told POLITICO on Wednesday that they want more time to look into Wray’s record before weighing in definitively. Most did not offer immediate criticism after quickly aligning against their former colleague Joe Lieberman, an early front-runner for Trump’s FBI nod.

“I’ve had people that I know who give him high marks,” said Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. “But I’d like to do a little due diligence first.”

Asked about Wray’s ties to Christie, Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) said: “I don’t know that anyone who’s ever associated with anybody in the campaign is necessarily automatically disqualified.”

“I think he has solid experience and expertise,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said in an interview. “He needs to have, as well, the independence and guts to stand up to political pressure, which seems all too common in this administration.”

Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) said she knows “nothing about” Wray but praised “the fact that he’s not a politician” and “the fact that he’s been a prosecutor. We’ll wait to see what law enforcement’s reaction is. Obviously, the big concern is independence. Is he somebody who is going to act independent of this administration?”

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said he has “heard some people I trust say nice things about him this morning, but I don’t know enough about him to have an opinion.”

Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said he would look at Wray’s record “very carefully” but had heard a “positive response” from Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who does know the prospective nominee.

Wray must show that he has “the strength of character to stand up to” any administration official “who tries to divert a legitimate criminal investigation,” Durbin added.

In a statement, Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday called Wray “an extraordinary person” with “outstanding accomplishments and a proven record of public service.” He lauded Wray’s past work as a U.S. attorney and his service at the Justice Department, especially in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, when Wray was the principal associate deputy attorney general.

“Chris combines a brilliant legal mind, outstanding accomplishments, and a proven record of public service. We are fortunate that he is willing to make this personal commitment to serve his country at this important time,” Sessions said in a statement. “The President asked us to look for an FBI Director who has integrity, who understands and is committed to the rule of law, and who is dedicated to protecting the American people from crime, gangs, and terrorists. We have found our man in Chris Wray.”

Chris Christie said last week he thought Wray “would provide great leadership at the FBI,” though he declined to say whether he had recommended him to the president. The two met when Christie was a U.S. attorney in New Jersey and Wray was at the Justice Department. They collaborated on a criminal investigation into the accounting practices of Bristol-Myers Squibb.

“I have the utmost confidence in Chris. He’s an outstanding lawyer,” Christie told reporters last Thursday as Wray’s name was being floated for the position. “He has absolute integrity and honesty, and I think that the president certainly would not be making a mistake if he asked Chris Wray to be FBI director.”

Ryan on FBI pick: I wasn't consulted by Trump

Wray was one of two candidates, along with John Pistole, a former TSA administrator and deputy FBI director, Trump interviewed last week for the position. Others considered for the job included Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas).

The president’s pick drew praise from a pair of Obama administration officials. Matthew Miller, a former Justice Department spokesman, tweeted that Wray was “probably the best choice from the WH short list. His record in the Bush DOJ deserves scrutiny, but he’s a serious, respectable pick.”

In a series of posts to Twitter, Norm Eisen, a White House ethics lawyer during the Obama administration, called Wray a “good choice” who is “very respected in [the] white-collar bar” and “did good job on Enron.” Wray’s past work for Christie should not necessarily count against him, Eisen wrote online, because it is “important not to confuse lawyers and their clients; I repped some controversial folks, too, before becoming a watchdog!”

Brian Fallon, another Obama-era DOJ spokesman who worked on Clinton’s failed 2016 presidential bid, was more skeptical, writing online that “Wray’s work as Christie’s lawyer not disqualifying by itself, but may be basis to say he’ll recuse from Russia probe as part of confirmation.”

Rosenstein has since appointed a special prosecutor to oversee the Russia investigation, a move Trump has railed against. Comey himself is scheduled to testify on Thursday before the Senate Intelligence Committee, where he is likely to be asked about reports that Trump pressured him to back off the bureau’s investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

''
With those striking words in an interview published late Sunday , Lisa Page , the ex-FBI lawyer who carried on an extramarital affair with former FBI head of counterintelligence Peter Strzok as the two exchanged anti-Trump text messages , said she was breaking her silence .
The 39-year-old Page was referring to Trump 's comments about her and Strzok at an October rally . During the event , Trump performed a passionate , dramatic reading of Strzok and Page 's August 2016 text messages , including Strzok 's conspicuous promise to Page that `` we 'll stop '' Trump from becoming president . At the time , Strzok was overseeing the Hillary Clinton email investigation and the probe into the Trump campaign .
At one point , Trump screamed out , `` I love you , Lisa ! I love you so much ! Lisa , she 's going to win one-hundred-million-to-nothing . But just in case she does n't win , we 've got an insurance policy ! '' ( Conservative commentators have disputed that Trump was mimicking an orgasm . )
Page spoke exclusively to The Daily Beast Sunday in a highly sympathetic profile authored by Molly Jong-Fast , who called Strzok `` hawt '' in a tweet last year . In the interview , Page said Trump 's remarks had forced her to confront the president publicly .
`` I had stayed quiet for years hoping it would fade away , but instead it got worse , ” Page said . “ It had been so hard not to defend myself , to let people who hate me control the narrative . I decided to take my power back . ”
The interview comes just days before a widely anticipated new report from DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz into possible FBI misconduct is expected to be released Dec. 9 . Horowitz has reportedly found that an unidentified lower-level FBI lawyer falsified a key document used to obtain a secret surveillance warrant against a former Trump adviser . In a report last year , Horowitz found that the `` damage '' from Strzok and Page 's conduct implicated `` the heart of the FBI 's reputation for neutral factfinding and political independence '' and `` cast a cloud over the entire FBI investigation '' into Clinton .
But , Page claimed she was coming forward now because of Trump 's `` fake orgasm , '' not to get ahead of the new upcoming IG report .
“ It 's like being punched in the gut , '' Page continued . `` My heart drops to my stomach when I realize he has tweeted about me again . The president of the United States is calling me names to the entire world . He ’ s demeaning me and my career . It ’ s sickening . ”
Separately , Page tweeted , `` I 'm done being quiet . '' In her interview , Page went on to call the president 's remarks `` intimidating . ''
“ But it 's also very intimidating because he ’ s still the president of the United States , '' Page said . `` And when the president accuses you of treason by name , despite the fact that I know there 's no fathomable way that I have committed any crime at all , let alone treason , he 's still somebody in a position to actually do something about that . To try to further destroy my life . It never goes away or stops , even when he ’ s not publicly attacking me . ”

“ I 'm someone who ’ s always in my head anyway – so now otherwise normal interactions take on a different meaning , '' Page complained . `` Like , when somebody makes eye contact with me on the Metro , I kind of wince , wondering if it ’ s because they recognize me , or are they just scanning the train like people do ? It ’ s immediately a question of friend or foe ? Or if I ’ m walking down the street or shopping and there ’ s somebody wearing Trump gear or a MAGA hat , I ’ ll walk the other way or try to put some distance between us because I ’ m not looking for conflict . Really , what I wanted most in this world is my life back . ”
Page insisted that when she was assigned to the Clinton email probe , she knew the `` case was going to get picked apart '' and that `` Director [ James ] Comey was very clear he wanted this completed as soon as humanly possible and outside of the political environment . So there was a real focus to get it done before the conventions that were happening that summer . And so that ’ s what we did . ”
However , as the FBI was preparing to interview Clinton at her home at the close of the email probe , Page sent Strzok a text message that suggested she was concerned about the political impact of the investigation .

“ One more thing : She might be our next president , ” Page wrote to Strzok on Feb. 24 , 2016 . “ The last thing you need us going in there loaded for bear . You think she ’ s going to remember or care that it was more doj than fbi ? ”
Horowitz , the DOJ inspector general , noted in an initial report last year that Strzok and Page 's anti-Trump texts were `` not only indicative of a biased state of mind but , even more seriously , implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate ’ s electoral prospects . ”
Comey 's firing shortly after Trump took office , Page said , was `` totally within the authority of the president , '' but at the same time was `` unprecedented and unimaginable given the circumstances . ''
“ It was horrible , ” Page said . “ It was a devastating moment at the FBI . It was like a funeral , only worse , because at least when someone dies , you get to come together and celebrate and talk about that person . He was still alive . But he was inaccessible to us . It jolted the ranks and the investigation . It was so abrupt . He was there one day and gone the next . ... The president fired him with the knowledge that , of course , we were investigating Russian contacts with his campaign . I mean , it just gave the aura of an obstructive effort . ”
Page said that when internal DOJ investigators said she was under investigation for anti-Trump text messages , she had no idea what they were talking about -- and maintained , as Strzok has , that she is capable of separating her personal life from work .
“ At the end of July in 2017 , I am informed by the DOJ Inspector General 's office that I ’ m under investigation for political text messages and honestly , I have no idea what they 're talking about , ” Page said . “ I have no recollection . And initially they ’ re very coy about it . They don ’ t tell me much about it . I do n't have the first clue what they 're talking about . What I do know is that my text messages will reveal that I had previously had an affair . I ’ m overwhelmed by dread and embarrassment at the prospect that OIG investigators , Andy [ McCabe ] , and my colleagues , now know or could learn about this deeply personal secret . ”
Last month , the Department of Justice released documents outlining a slew of `` security violations '' and flagrantly `` unprofessional conduct '' by Peter Strzok — including his alleged practice of keeping sensitive FBI documents on his unsecured personal electronic devices , even as his wife gained access to his cellphone and discovered evidence that he was having an affair with Page .
Although Strzok claimed to have `` double deleted '' sensitive FBI materials from his personal devices , his wife nonetheless apparently found evidence of his affair on his cellphone — including photographs and a hotel reservation `` ostensibly '' used for a `` romantic encounter . '' Strzok did n't consent to turning over the devices for review , according to the DOJ , even as he acknowledged using Apple 's iMessage service for some FBI work .

Naylor","On Dec. 29 , 2016 , the Obama administration announced that it was giving nearly three dozen Russian diplomats just 72 hours to leave the United States and was seizing two rural East Coast estates owned by the Russian government . As the Russians burned papers and scrambled to pack their bags , the Kremlin protested the treatment of its diplomats , and denied that those compounds — sometimes known as the “ dachas ” — were anything more than vacation spots for their personnel .
The Obama administration ’ s public rationale for the expulsions and closures — the harshest U.S. diplomatic reprisals taken against Russia in several decades — was to retaliate for Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election . But there was another critical , and secret , reason why those locations and diplomats were targeted .
Both compounds , and at least some of the expelled diplomats , played key roles in a brazen Russian counterintelligence operation that stretched from the Bay Area to the heart of the nation ’ s capital , according to former U.S. officials . The operation , which targeted FBI communications , hampered the bureau ’ s ability to track Russian spies on U.S. soil at a time of increasing tension with Moscow , forced the FBI and CIA to cease contact with some of their Russian assets , and prompted tighter security procedures at key U.S. national security facilities in the Washington area and elsewhere , according to former U.S. officials . It even raised concerns among some U.S. officials about a Russian mole within the U.S. intelligence community .
“ It was a very broad effort to try and penetrate our most sensitive operations , ” said a former senior CIA official .
American officials discovered that the Russians had dramatically improved their ability to decrypt certain types of secure communications and had successfully tracked devices used by elite FBI surveillance teams . Officials also feared that the Russians may have devised other ways to monitor U.S. intelligence communications , including hacking into computers not connected to the internet . Senior FBI and CIA officials briefed congressional leaders on these issues as part of a wide-ranging examination on Capitol Hill of U.S. counterintelligence vulnerabilities .
These compromises , the full gravity of which became clear to U.S. officials in 2012 , gave Russian spies in American cities including Washington , New York and San Francisco key insights into the location of undercover FBI surveillance teams , and likely the actual substance of FBI communications , according to former officials . They provided the Russians opportunities to potentially shake off FBI surveillance and communicate with sensitive human sources , check on remote recording devices and even gather intelligence on their FBI pursuers , the former officials said .
“ When we found out about this , the light bulb went on — that this could be why we haven ’ t seen [ certain types of ] activity ” from known Russian spies in the United States , said a former senior intelligence official .
The compromise of FBI systems occurred not long after the White House ’ s 2010 decision to arrest and expose a group of “ illegals ” – Russian operatives embedded in American society under deep non-official cover – and reflected a resurgence of Russian espionage . Just a few months after the illegals pleaded guilty in July 2010 , the FBI opened a new investigation into a group of New York-based undercover Russian intelligence officers . These Russian spies , the FBI discovered , were attempting to recruit a ring of U.S. assets — including Carter Page , an American businessman who would later act as an unpaid foreign policy adviser to Donald Trump ’ s 2016 presidential campaign .
The breaches also spoke to larger challenges faced by U.S. intelligence agencies in guarding the nation ’ s secrets , an issue highlighted by recent revelations , first published by CNN , that the CIA was forced to extract a key Russian asset and bring him to the U.S. in 2017 . The asset was reportedly critical to the U.S. intelligence community ’ s conclusion that Russian President Vladimir Putin had personally directed the interference in the 2016 presidential election in support of Donald Trump .
Yahoo spoke about these previously unreported technical breaches and the larger government debates surrounding U.S. policies toward Russia with more than 50 current and former intelligence and national security officials , most of whom requested anonymity to discuss sensitive operations and internal discussions . While the officials expressed a variety of views on what went wrong with U.S.-Russian relations , some said the United States at times neglected to appreciate the espionage challenge from Moscow , and paid a significant price for a failure to prioritize technical threats .
“ When I was in office , the counterintelligence business was … focused entirely on its core concern , which is insider threats , and in particular mole hunting , ” said Joel Brenner , the head of U.S. counterintelligence and strategy from 2006 to 2009 . “ This is , in fact , the core risk and it ’ s right that it should be the focus . But we were neither organized nor resourced to deal with counterintelligence in networks , technical networks , electronic networks . ”
The discovery of Russia ’ s newfound capacity to crack certain types of encryption was particularly unnerving , according to former U.S. officials .
“ Anytime you find out that an adversary has these capabilities , it sets off a ripple effect , ” said a former senior national security official . “ The Russians are able to extract every capability from any given technology . ... They are singularly dangerous in this area . ”
The FBI ’ s discovery of these compromises took place on the heels of what many hoped would be a breakthrough between Washington and Moscow — the Obama administration ’ s 2009 “ reset ” initiative , which sought to improve U.S.-Russia relations . Despite what seemed to be some initial progress , the reset soon went awry .
In September 2011 , Vladimir Putin announced the launch of his third presidential campaign , only to be confronted during the following months by tens of thousands of protesters accusing him of electoral fraud . Putin , a former intelligence officer , publicly accused then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of fomenting the unrest .
It was around this time that Putin ’ s spies in the United States , operating under diplomatic cover , achieved what a former senior intelligence official called a “ stunning ” technical breakthrough , demonstrating their relentless focus on the country they ’ ve long considered their primary adversary .
That effort compromised the encrypted radio systems used by the FBI ’ s mobile surveillance teams , which track the movements of Russian spies on American soil , according to more than half a dozen former senior intelligence and national security officials . Around the same time , Russian spies also compromised the FBI teams ’ backup communications systems — cellphones outfitted with “ push-to-talk ” walkie-talkie capabilities . “ This was something we took extremely seriously , ” said a former senior counterintelligence official .
The Russian operation went beyond tracking the communications devices used by FBI surveillance teams , according to four former senior officials . Working out of secret “ listening posts ” housed in Russian diplomatic and other government-controlled facilities , the Russians were able to intercept , record and eventually crack the codes to FBI radio communications .
Some of the clandestine eavesdropping annexes were staffed by the wives of Russian intelligence officers , said a former senior intelligence official . That operation was part of a larger sustained , deliberate Russian campaign targeting secret U.S. government communications throughout the United States , according to former officials .
The two Russian government compounds in Maryland and New York closed in 2016 played a role in the operation , according to three former officials . They were “ basically being used as signals intelligence facilities , ” said one former senior national security official .
Russian spies also deployed “ mobile listening posts. ” Some Russian intelligence officers , carrying signals intelligence gear , would walk near FBI surveillance teams . Others drove vans full of listening equipment aimed at intercepting FBI teams ’ communications . For the Russians , the operation was “ amazingly low risk in an angering way , ” said a former senior intelligence official .
The FBI teams were using relatively lightweight radios with limited range , according to former officials . These low-tech devices allowed the teams to move quickly and discreetly while tracking their targets , which would have been more difficult with clunkier but more secure technology , a former official said . But the outdated radios left the teams ’ communications vulnerable to the Russians . “ The amount of security you employ is the inverse of being able to do things with flexibility , agility and at scale , ” said the former official .
A former senior counterintelligence official blamed the compromises on a “ hodgepodge of systems ” ineffective beyond the line of sight . “ The infrastructure that was supposed to be built , they never followed up , or gave us the money for it , ” said the former official . “ The intelligence community has never gotten an integrated system . ”
The limitations of the radio technology , said the former senior officials , led the FBI ’ s surveillance personnel to communicate on the backup systems .
“ Eventually they switched to push-to-talk cellphones , ” said a former counterintelligence executive . “ The tech guys would get upset by that , because if they could intercept radio , they might be able to intercept telephones . ”
That is indeed what happened . Those devices were then identified and compromised by Russian intelligence operatives . ( A number of other countries ’ surveillance teams — including those from hostile services — also transitioned from using radios to cellphones during this time , noted another former official . )
U.S. intelligence officials were uncertain whether the Russians were able to unscramble the FBI conversations in real time . But even the ability to decrypt them later would have given the Russians critical insights into FBI surveillance practices , including “ call signs and locations , team composition and tactics , ” said a former intelligence official .
U.S. officials were also unsure about how long the Russians had been able to decipher FBI communications before the bureau realized what was happening . “ There was a gap between when they were really onto us , and when we got onto them , ” said a former senior intelligence official .
Even after they understood that the Russians had compromised the FBI teams ’ radios , U.S. counterintelligence officials could not agree on how they had done it . “ The intel reporting was they did break our codes or got their hands on a radio and figured it out , ” said a former senior intelligence official . “ Either way , they decrypted our comms . ”
Officials also cautioned , however , that the Russians could only crack moderately encrypted communications , not the strongest types of encryption used by the U.S. government for its most sensitive transmissions . It was nonetheless “ an incredible intelligence success ” for the Russians , said the former senior official .
While the Russians may have developed this capability by themselves , senior counterintelligence officials also feared that someone from within the U.S. government — a Russian mole — may have helped them , said former officials . “ You ’ re wondering , ‘ If this is true , and they can do this , is this because someone on the inside has given them that information ? ’ ’ said another former senior intelligence official .
Russia has a clear interest in concealing how it gets its information , further muddying the waters . According to a former senior CIA officer who served in Moscow , the Russians would often try to disguise a human source as a technical penetration . Ultimately , officials were unable to pinpoint exactly how the Russians pulled off the compromise of the FBI ’ s systems .
Mark Kelton , who served as the chief of counterintelligence at the CIA until he retired in 2015 , declined to discuss specific Russian operations , but he told Yahoo News that “ the Russians are a professionally proficient adversary who have historically penetrated every American institution worth penetrating . ”
This remains a core worry for U.S. spy hunters . The number of ongoing espionage investigations into U.S. government personnel — at the CIA , the FBI and elsewhere — including those potentially recruited by Russia , “ is not a little , it ’ s a lot , ” said another former senior counterintelligence official .
Once the compromises of FBI communications devices were confirmed , U.S. officials scrambled to minimize the exposure of mobile surveillance team operations , quickly putting countermeasures in place , according to former senior officials . There was a “ huge concern ” about protecting the identities of the individuals on the teams — an elite , secret group — said the former senior counterintelligence official . U.S. officials also conducted a damage assessment and repeatedly briefed select White House officials and members of Congress about the compromise .
After the FBI discovered that its surveillance teams ’ cellphones had been compromised , they were forced to switch back to encrypted radios , purchasing different models , according to two former officials . “ It was an expensive venture , ” said one former counterintelligence official .
But the spying successes went both ways . The U.S. intelligence community collected its own inside information to conclude that the damage from the compromises had been limited , partly due to the Russians ’ efforts to keep their intelligence coup secret , according to a former senior intelligence official . “ The Russians were reticent to take steps [ that might reveal ] that they ’ d figured it out , ” the former senior official said .
Even so , the costs to U.S. intelligence were significant . Spooked by the discovery that its surveillance teams ’ communications had been compromised , the FBI worried that some of its assets had been blown , said two former senior intelligence officials . The bureau consequently cut off contact with some of its Russian sources , according to one of those officials .
At the time of the compromise , some of the FBI ’ s other Russian assets stopped cooperating with their American handlers . “ There were a couple instances where a recruited person had said , ‘ I can ’ t meet you anymore , ’ ” said a former senior intelligence official . In a damage assessment conducted around 2012 , U.S. intelligence officials concluded the events may have been linked .
The impact was not limited to the FBI . Alerted by the bureau to concerns surrounding Russia ’ s enhanced interception capabilities , the CIA also ceased certain types of communications with sources abroad , according to a former senior CIA official . The agency “ had to resort to a whole series of steps ” to ensure the Russians weren ’ t able to eavesdrop on CIA communications , the former senior official said . There was a “ strong hint ” that these newly discovered code-breaking capabilities by Russia were also being used abroad , said another former senior intelligence official .
The CIA has long been wary of Russian spies ’ eavesdropping efforts outside of the United States , especially near U.S. diplomatic facilities . U.S. officials have observed Russian technical officers repeatedly walking close to those compounds with packages in their hands , or wearing backpacks , or pushing strollers , or driving by in vehicles — all attempts , U.S. officials believe , to collect information on the different signals emanating from the facilities . While the tools used by the Russians for these activities were “ a bit antiquated , ” said a former senior CIA official , they were still a “ constant concern . ”
It ’ s not unusual for intelligence officers operating from diplomatic facilities , including the United States ’ s own operatives , to try and intercept the communications of the host nation . “ You had to find ways to attack their surveillance , ” said Rolf Mowatt-Larssen , former head of counterintelligence at the Department of Energy and a former CIA officer who first served in Moscow in the 1980s . “ The Russians do everything in the U.S. that we did in Moscow . ”
Indeed , the focus on cracking radio communications was no different .
“ We put extraordinary effort into intercepting and monitoring the FSB surveillance radio networks for the purpose of understanding whether our officers were under surveillance or not , ” said another former senior CIA officer who also served in Moscow .
The discovery of the Russians ’ new code-breaking capabilities came at a time when gathering intelligence on Russia and its leaders ’ intentions was of particular importance to the U.S. government . U.S. national security officials working on Russia at the time received rigorous security training on how to keep their digital devices secure , according to two former senior officials . One former U.S. official recalled how during the negotiations surrounding the reset , NSC officials , partially tongue in cheek , “ would sometimes say things on the phone hoping [ they ] were communicating things to the Russians . ”
According to a former CIA official and a former national security official , the CIA ’ s analysts often disagreed about how committed Russia was to negotiations during the attempted reset and how far Putin would go to achieve his strategic aims , divergences that confused the White House and senior policy makers .
“ It caused a really big rift within the [ National Security Council ] on how seriously they took analysis from the agency , ” said the former CIA official . Senior administration leaders “ went along with ” some of the more optimistic analysis on the future of U.S.-Russia relations “ in the hopes that this would work out , ” the official continued .
Those disagreements were part of a “ reset hangover ” that persisted , at least for some inside the administration , until the 2016 election meddling , according to a former senior national security official . Those officials clung to the hope that Washington and Moscow could cooperate on key issues , despite aggressive Russian actions ranging from the invasion of Ukraine to its spying efforts .
“ We didn ’ t understand that they were at political war with us already in the second term once Putin was reelected and Obama himself was reelected , ” said Evelyn Farkas , the former deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia , Ukraine , and Eurasia during the Obama administration .
As high-level hopes for the U.S.-Russia “ reset ” withered , concerns about the threat of Russian spying made their way to Capitol Hill . Top officials at the FBI and CIA briefed key members of Congress on counterintelligence issues related to Russia , according to current and former U.S. officials .

I 'll guarantee it 's happening today . ”","On Dec. 29, 2016, the Obama administration announced that it was giving nearly three dozen Russian diplomats just 72 hours to leave the United States and was seizing two rural East Coast estates owned by the Russian government. As the Russians burned papers and scrambled to pack their bags, the Kremlin protested the treatment of its diplomats, and denied that those compounds — sometimes known as the “dachas” — were anything more than vacation spots for their personnel.

The Obama administration’s public rationale for the expulsions and closures — the harshest U.S. diplomatic reprisals taken against Russia in several decades — was to retaliate for Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. But there was another critical, and secret, reason why those locations and diplomats were targeted.

Both compounds, and at least some of the expelled diplomats, played key roles in a brazen Russian counterintelligence operation that stretched from the Bay Area to the heart of the nation’s capital, according to former U.S. officials. The operation, which targeted FBI communications, hampered the bureau’s ability to track Russian spies on U.S. soil at a time of increasing tension with Moscow, forced the FBI and CIA to cease contact with some of their Russian assets, and prompted tighter security procedures at key U.S. national security facilities in the Washington area and elsewhere, according to former U.S. officials. It even raised concerns among some U.S. officials about a Russian mole within the U.S. intelligence community.

“It was a very broad effort to try and penetrate our most sensitive operations,” said a former senior CIA official.

American officials discovered that the Russians had dramatically improved their ability to decrypt certain types of secure communications and had successfully tracked devices used by elite FBI surveillance teams. Officials also feared that the Russians may have devised other ways to monitor U.S. intelligence communications, including hacking into computers not connected to the internet. Senior FBI and CIA officials briefed congressional leaders on these issues as part of a wide-ranging examination on Capitol Hill of U.S. counterintelligence vulnerabilities.

These compromises, the full gravity of which became clear to U.S. officials in 2012, gave Russian spies in American cities including Washington, New York and San Francisco key insights into the location of undercover FBI surveillance teams, and likely the actual substance of FBI communications, according to former officials. They provided the Russians opportunities to potentially shake off FBI surveillance and communicate with sensitive human sources, check on remote recording devices and even gather intelligence on their FBI pursuers, the former officials said.

“When we found out about this, the light bulb went on — that this could be why we haven’t seen [certain types of] activity” from known Russian spies in the United States, said a former senior intelligence official.

The compromise of FBI systems occurred not long after the White House’s 2010 decision to arrest and expose a group of “illegals” – Russian operatives embedded in American society under deep non-official cover – and reflected a resurgence of Russian espionage. Just a few months after the illegals pleaded guilty in July 2010, the FBI opened a new investigation into a group of New York-based undercover Russian intelligence officers. These Russian spies, the FBI discovered, were attempting to recruit a ring of U.S. assets — including Carter Page, an American businessman who would later act as an unpaid foreign policy adviser to Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.

The breaches also spoke to larger challenges faced by U.S. intelligence agencies in guarding the nation’s secrets, an issue highlighted by recent revelations, first published by CNN, that the CIA was forced to extract a key Russian asset and bring him to the U.S. in 2017. The asset was reportedly critical to the U.S. intelligence community’s conclusion that Russian President Vladimir Putin had personally directed the interference in the 2016 presidential election in support of Donald Trump.

Yahoo spoke about these previously unreported technical breaches and the larger government debates surrounding U.S. policies toward Russia with more than 50 current and former intelligence and national security officials, most of whom requested anonymity to discuss sensitive operations and internal discussions. While the officials expressed a variety of views on what went wrong with U.S.-Russian relations, some said the United States at times neglected to appreciate the espionage challenge from Moscow, and paid a significant price for a failure to prioritize technical threats.

“When I was in office, the counterintelligence business was … focused entirely on its core concern, which is insider threats, and in particular mole hunting,” said Joel Brenner, the head of U.S. counterintelligence and strategy from 2006 to 2009. “This is, in fact, the core risk and it’s right that it should be the focus. But we were neither organized nor resourced to deal with counterintelligence in networks, technical networks, electronic networks.”

The discovery of Russia’s newfound capacity to crack certain types of encryption was particularly unnerving, according to former U.S. officials.

“Anytime you find out that an adversary has these capabilities, it sets off a ripple effect,” said a former senior national security official. “The Russians are able to extract every capability from any given technology. ... They are singularly dangerous in this area.”

The FBI’s discovery of these compromises took place on the heels of what many hoped would be a breakthrough between Washington and Moscow — the Obama administration’s 2009 “reset” initiative, which sought to improve U.S.-Russia relations. Despite what seemed to be some initial progress, the reset soon went awry.

In September 2011, Vladimir Putin announced the launch of his third presidential campaign, only to be confronted during the following months by tens of thousands of protesters accusing him of electoral fraud. Putin, a former intelligence officer, publicly accused then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of fomenting the unrest.

It was around this time that Putin’s spies in the United States, operating under diplomatic cover, achieved what a former senior intelligence official called a “stunning” technical breakthrough, demonstrating their relentless focus on the country they’ve long considered their primary adversary.

That effort compromised the encrypted radio systems used by the FBI’s mobile surveillance teams, which track the movements of Russian spies on American soil, according to more than half a dozen former senior intelligence and national security officials. Around the same time, Russian spies also compromised the FBI teams’ backup communications systems — cellphones outfitted with “push-to-talk” walkie-talkie capabilities. “This was something we took extremely seriously,” said a former senior counterintelligence official.

The Russian operation went beyond tracking the communications devices used by FBI surveillance teams, according to four former senior officials. Working out of secret “listening posts” housed in Russian diplomatic and other government-controlled facilities, the Russians were able to intercept, record and eventually crack the codes to FBI radio communications.

Some of the clandestine eavesdropping annexes were staffed by the wives of Russian intelligence officers, said a former senior intelligence official. That operation was part of a larger sustained, deliberate Russian campaign targeting secret U.S. government communications throughout the United States, according to former officials.

The two Russian government compounds in Maryland and New York closed in 2016 played a role in the operation, according to three former officials. They were “basically being used as signals intelligence facilities,” said one former senior national security official.

Russian spies also deployed “mobile listening posts.” Some Russian intelligence officers, carrying signals intelligence gear, would walk near FBI surveillance teams. Others drove vans full of listening equipment aimed at intercepting FBI teams’ communications. For the Russians, the operation was “amazingly low risk in an angering way,” said a former senior intelligence official.

The FBI teams were using relatively lightweight radios with limited range, according to former officials. These low-tech devices allowed the teams to move quickly and discreetly while tracking their targets, which would have been more difficult with clunkier but more secure technology, a former official said. But the outdated radios left the teams’ communications vulnerable to the Russians. “The amount of security you employ is the inverse of being able to do things with flexibility, agility and at scale,” said the former official.

A former senior counterintelligence official blamed the compromises on a “hodgepodge of systems” ineffective beyond the line of sight. “The infrastructure that was supposed to be built, they never followed up, or gave us the money for it,” said the former official. “The intelligence community has never gotten an integrated system.”

The limitations of the radio technology, said the former senior officials, led the FBI’s surveillance personnel to communicate on the backup systems.

“Eventually they switched to push-to-talk cellphones,” said a former counterintelligence executive. “The tech guys would get upset by that, because if they could intercept radio, they might be able to intercept telephones.”

That is indeed what happened. Those devices were then identified and compromised by Russian intelligence operatives. (A number of other countries’ surveillance teams — including those from hostile services — also transitioned from using radios to cellphones during this time, noted another former official.)

U.S. intelligence officials were uncertain whether the Russians were able to unscramble the FBI conversations in real time. But even the ability to decrypt them later would have given the Russians critical insights into FBI surveillance practices, including “call signs and locations, team composition and tactics,” said a former intelligence official.

U.S. officials were also unsure about how long the Russians had been able to decipher FBI communications before the bureau realized what was happening. “There was a gap between when they were really onto us, and when we got onto them,” said a former senior intelligence official.

Even after they understood that the Russians had compromised the FBI teams’ radios, U.S. counterintelligence officials could not agree on how they had done it. “The intel reporting was they did break our codes or got their hands on a radio and figured it out,” said a former senior intelligence official. “Either way, they decrypted our comms.”

Officials also cautioned, however, that the Russians could only crack moderately encrypted communications, not the strongest types of encryption used by the U.S. government for its most sensitive transmissions. It was nonetheless “an incredible intelligence success” for the Russians, said the former senior official.

While the Russians may have developed this capability by themselves, senior counterintelligence officials also feared that someone from within the U.S. government — a Russian mole — may have helped them, said former officials. “You’re wondering, ‘If this is true, and they can do this, is this because someone on the inside has given them that information?’’ said another former senior intelligence official.

Russia has a clear interest in concealing how it gets its information, further muddying the waters. According to a former senior CIA officer who served in Moscow, the Russians would often try to disguise a human source as a technical penetration. Ultimately, officials were unable to pinpoint exactly how the Russians pulled off the compromise of the FBI’s systems.

Mark Kelton, who served as the chief of counterintelligence at the CIA until he retired in 2015, declined to discuss specific Russian operations, but he told Yahoo News that “the Russians are a professionally proficient adversary who have historically penetrated every American institution worth penetrating.”

This remains a core worry for U.S. spy hunters. The number of ongoing espionage investigations into U.S. government personnel — at the CIA, the FBI and elsewhere — including those potentially recruited by Russia, “is not a little, it’s a lot,” said another former senior counterintelligence official.

Once the compromises of FBI communications devices were confirmed, U.S. officials scrambled to minimize the exposure of mobile surveillance team operations, quickly putting countermeasures in place, according to former senior officials. There was a “huge concern” about protecting the identities of the individuals on the teams — an elite, secret group — said the former senior counterintelligence official. U.S. officials also conducted a damage assessment and repeatedly briefed select White House officials and members of Congress about the compromise.

After the FBI discovered that its surveillance teams’ cellphones had been compromised, they were forced to switch back to encrypted radios, purchasing different models, according to two former officials. “It was an expensive venture,” said one former counterintelligence official.

But the spying successes went both ways. The U.S. intelligence community collected its own inside information to conclude that the damage from the compromises had been limited, partly due to the Russians’ efforts to keep their intelligence coup secret, according to a former senior intelligence official. “The Russians were reticent to take steps [that might reveal] that they’d figured it out,” the former senior official said.

Even so, the costs to U.S. intelligence were significant. Spooked by the discovery that its surveillance teams’ communications had been compromised, the FBI worried that some of its assets had been blown, said two former senior intelligence officials. The bureau consequently cut off contact with some of its Russian sources, according to one of those officials.

At the time of the compromise, some of the FBI’s other Russian assets stopped cooperating with their American handlers. “There were a couple instances where a recruited person had said, ‘I can’t meet you anymore,’” said a former senior intelligence official. In a damage assessment conducted around 2012, U.S. intelligence officials concluded the events may have been linked.

The impact was not limited to the FBI. Alerted by the bureau to concerns surrounding Russia’s enhanced interception capabilities, the CIA also ceased certain types of communications with sources abroad, according to a former senior CIA official. The agency “had to resort to a whole series of steps” to ensure the Russians weren’t able to eavesdrop on CIA communications, the former senior official said. There was a “strong hint” that these newly discovered code-breaking capabilities by Russia were also being used abroad, said another former senior intelligence official.

The CIA has long been wary of Russian spies’ eavesdropping efforts outside of the United States, especially near U.S. diplomatic facilities. U.S. officials have observed Russian technical officers repeatedly walking close to those compounds with packages in their hands, or wearing backpacks, or pushing strollers, or driving by in vehicles — all attempts, U.S. officials believe, to collect information on the different signals emanating from the facilities. While the tools used by the Russians for these activities were “a bit antiquated,” said a former senior CIA official, they were still a “constant concern.”

It’s not unusual for intelligence officers operating from diplomatic facilities, including the United States’s own operatives, to try and intercept the communications of the host nation. “You had to find ways to attack their surveillance,” said Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, former head of counterintelligence at the Department of Energy and a former CIA officer who first served in Moscow in the 1980s. “The Russians do everything in the U.S. that we did in Moscow.”

Indeed, the focus on cracking radio communications was no different.

“We put extraordinary effort into intercepting and monitoring the FSB surveillance radio networks for the purpose of understanding whether our officers were under surveillance or not,” said another former senior CIA officer who also served in Moscow.

The discovery of the Russians’ new code-breaking capabilities came at a time when gathering intelligence on Russia and its leaders’ intentions was of particular importance to the U.S. government. U.S. national security officials working on Russia at the time received rigorous security training on how to keep their digital devices secure, according to two former senior officials. One former U.S. official recalled how during the negotiations surrounding the reset, NSC officials, partially tongue in cheek, “would sometimes say things on the phone hoping [they] were communicating things to the Russians.”

According to a former CIA official and a former national security official, the CIA’s analysts often disagreed about how committed Russia was to negotiations during the attempted reset and how far Putin would go to achieve his strategic aims, divergences that confused the White House and senior policy makers.

“It caused a really big rift within the [National Security Council] on how seriously they took analysis from the agency,” said the former CIA official. Senior administration leaders “went along with” some of the more optimistic analysis on the future of U.S.-Russia relations “in the hopes that this would work out,” the official continued.

Those disagreements were part of a “reset hangover” that persisted, at least for some inside the administration, until the 2016 election meddling, according to a former senior national security official. Those officials clung to the hope that Washington and Moscow could cooperate on key issues, despite aggressive Russian actions ranging from the invasion of Ukraine to its spying efforts.

“We didn’t understand that they were at political war with us already in the second term once Putin was reelected and Obama himself was reelected,” said Evelyn Farkas, the former deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia during the Obama administration.

As high-level hopes for the U.S.-Russia “reset” withered, concerns about the threat of Russian spying made their way to Capitol Hill. Top officials at the FBI and CIA briefed key members of Congress on counterintelligence issues related to Russia, according to current and former U.S. officials. These included briefings on the radio compromises, said two former senior officials.

Mike Rogers, a former Republican lawmaker from Michigan who chaired the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence from 2011 to 2015, alluded to counterintelligence concerns at a conference earlier this year in Washington, D.C.

One of those concerns was a massive intelligence failure related to the secret internet-based communications system the CIA used to communicate with agents. The extent of that failure, first reported publicly by Yahoo News in 2018, got the attention of Congress earlier.

But the problems were broader than that issue, according to Rogers.

“Our counterintelligence operations needed some adjustments,” said Rogers, adding that he and his Democratic counterpart from Maryland, Dutch Ruppersberger, requested regular briefings on the subject from agency representatives. “We started out monthly until we just wore them out, then we did it quarterly to try to make sure that we had the right resources and the right focus for the entire community on counter[intelligence].”

Rogers later told Yahoo News that his request for the briefings had been prompted by “suspected penetrations, both physical and technical, which is the role of those [Russian and Chinese] intelligence services,” but declined to be more specific.

The former committee chairman said he wanted the intelligence community to make counterintelligence a higher priority. “Counterintelligence was always looked at as the crazy uncle at the party,” he said. “I wanted to raise it up and give it a robust importance.”

The briefings, which primarily involved counterintelligence officials from the FBI and CIA and were limited to the committee leadership and staff directors, led to “some useful inquiries to help focus the intelligence community,” Rogers said. The leaders of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence were also included in some of the inquiries, according to Rogers and a current U.S. government official.

Spokespeople for the current House and Senate intelligence committees did not respond to a request for comment. The FBI and CIA declined to comment. The Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C. did not respond to a request for comment.

The briefings were designed to “get the counterintelligence house in order,” said Jamil Jaffer, senior counsel at the House intelligence committee from 2011 to 2013, and to ensure that Congress and the intelligence agencies were “on the same page” when it came to such matters. “There were some concerns about what the agencies were doing, there were some concerns about what Congress knew, and all of these issues, of course, had China-Russia implications.”

NASCAR went to Talladega Superspeedway on heightened alert after Bubba Wallace, its only Black driver, took on an active role in a push for racial equality.

Wallace had successfully called for the ban of the Confederate flag and received threats. Fans paraded past the main entrance of the Alabama track displaying the flag, and a plane circled above the speedway pulling a Confederate flag banner that read “Defund NASCAR.”

So NASCAR moved quickly when one of Wallace’s crew members discovered a rope shaped like a noose in their garage stall. The sanctioning body called in federal authorities, who ruled Tuesday the rope had been hanging there since at least last October and was not a hate crime.

U.S. Attorney Jay Town and FBI Special Agent in Charge Johnnie Sharp Jr. said the investigation determined “nobody could have known Mr. Wallace would be assigned” to that same stall. NASCAR said it was the lone garage stall with a pull down rope that resembled a noose.

NASCAR has defended its reaction and insisted it would call the FBI again. A defiant Wallace said there is no confusion and the rope had been fashioned into a noose.

“I wanted to make sure this wasn’t just a knot,” Wallace said on CNN. “It was a noose. Whether it was tied in 2019 ... it is a noose.”

Wallace never saw the rope. He said NASCAR President Steve Phelps came to see him Sunday night at the track with “tears running down his face.”

“The evidence he brought to me was that a hate crime has been committed,” said Wallace, who instantly began to fear for the safety of his family.

Even after the FBI concluded that it was not a hate crime, Wallace remained angry at what he perceives as constant tests of his character. He holds no ill-will toward NASCAR.

“I stand behind Steve and I stand behind NASCAR,” he said. “NASCAR was worried about Talladega. We had that one circled on the radar with everything going on.”

NASCAR opened the Talladega gates to 5,000 fans, its highest number so far during the coronavirus pandemic.

Since finding his voice over the last month, the 26-year-old Mobile, Alabama native has embraced an international role in NASCAR’s attempt to push past its rocky racial history. Wallace has worn an “I Can’t Breathe” shirt, raced with a Black Lives Matter paint scheme in Virginia and successfully lobbied for the Confederate flag ban.

NASCAR assigned security to Wallace at the track. The first word of the incident came in a sharply worded statement in which NASCAR said it was “angry and outraged” over the “heinous act” that the series directly linked to racism.

The FBI sent 15 agents to Talladega for Monday’s rescheduled race at the same time the industry rallied around Wallace. In an unprecedented show of solidarity, every team member on pit road lined up behind him during the national anthem.

Phelps has taken exactly nine questions about the finding in Wallace’s garage and none provided any details of the incident. Because of health protocol restrictions, a limited number of personnel have access to the garage. Only a handful of Wallace’s crew members and NASCAR saw the rope.

Roughly 48 hours after the discovery, federal authorities said video confirmed the rope “was in that garage as early as October 2019” hanging from a garage door. The rope was referred to as a noose, but can be used as a handle when closing the door.

Phelps continued to call it a noose after authorities said no charges would be filed, and held firm in that NASCAR is investigating why the rope was tied that way. He was pleased it wasn’t a hate crime directed at Wallace, but insisted NASCAR would have conducted its investigation the same way even now knowing it was just a coincidence.

Inspector General Michael Horowitz , who submitted a harsh report asserting that McCabe misled Justice Department investigators last week , has referred the matter to the US attorney ’ s office in Washington , DC , for potential prosecution .
Yet though McCabe has been harshly criticized by President Donald Trump and his allies for months for supposed anti-Trump bias , he ’ s been investigated for and may be charged about a different topic entirely — that is , his purported attempts to mislead about his role in a leak at Hillary Clinton ’ s expense .
The gist is that McCabe orchestrated a leak to a Wall Street Journal reporter shortly before the 2016 election , describing private deliberations he ’ d had with Obama Justice Department officials about an investigation of the Clinton Foundation . McCabe leaked that he had tried to keep this investigation moving forward , over an unnamed Justice Department official ’ s resistance . His motivation for leaking about this pending investigation , it appeared , was to rebut an earlier Journal article raising questions about his impartiality in the Clinton email probe , and a planned follow-up piece along similar lines .
However , once the FBI began looking into how the Clinton Foundation leak happened , Horowitz claims that McCabe repeatedly misled officials about his involvement . The IG report says McCabe displayed a “ lack of candor ” on the topic on at least four separate occasions — falsely claiming several times that he didn ’ t know where the leak had come from , when in fact he had authorized it .
The Justice Department says it was these findings — not Trump ’ s fury at and angry tweets about McCabe — that spurred Attorney General Jeff Sessions ’ s controversial firing of McCabe one day before he was set to retire . And it ’ s these findings that would likely form the basis of any charges against McCabe , should the US attorney for the District of Columbia choose to pursue them .
McCabe has been trying to portray himself as corruptly and wrongly persecuted by President Trump for political and self-interested reasons , suggesting Trump hopes to discredit potential testimony from him in special counsel Robert Mueller ’ s probe of obstruction of justice . Indeed , the president has aimed a truly astonishing level of vitriol at McCabe , and the news comes in the context of Trump allies in Congress calling for the prosecution of not just McCabe but multiple Justice Department officials as well as Clinton herself .
Still , the allegations against McCabe in the IG report are quite serious , inspectors general traditionally operate with independence from their department leaders , and Horowitz was appointed under President Obama . So it ’ s too simple to say that McCabe is just being railroaded here . If he did indeed lie to investigators , that ’ s criminal conduct .
To understand the full scope of what ’ s going on here , it ’ s useful to separate out President Trump ’ s gripes with Andrew McCabe from the inspector general ’ s critique of Andrew McCabe — because they ’ re quite different .
Trump ’ s distrust for McCabe personally seems to date back to the revelation that when McCabe ’ s wife ran for Virginia state Senate in 2015 , the state ’ s Democratic governor , longtime Clinton ally Terry McAuliffe , raised money for her campaign . After the election ( she lost ) , McCabe was involved in overseeing the Clinton email investigation , and conservatives questioned whether this was a conflict . Trump would later cite this information repeatedly , both in public and in private , as showing McCabe ’ s supposed corruption . ( McCabe actually voted in the Republican primary in his state , Virginia , in 2016 . )
More broadly , though , Trump has been at war with his own FBI and Justice Department since he fired James Comey . He has repeatedly urged the department to charge his political and bureaucratic opponents with crimes . McCabe , as a Comey ally and career staffer , was a natural obstacle . There ’ s also been speculation that Trump hopes to discredit McCabe as a potential witness to obstruction of justice in the Mueller probe . So Trump openly campaigned for McCabe ’ s firing for months , and exulted when it finally happened .
Andrew McCabe FIRED , a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy . Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy . He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) March 17 , 2018
Yet you could follow everything Trump has said about McCabe for months and have no real understanding that he was fired for allegedly lying about his leaks about an investigation into Hillary Clinton .
The IG says McCabe misled investigators about a pre-election leak about Clinton
On October 24 , 2016 , the Wall Street Journal ’ s Devlin Barrett published that story about McCabe ’ s wife getting campaign contributions from McAuliffe , pointing out that McCabe had a role overseeing the Clinton email investigation .
Then on October 30 , Barrett published another story . His sources describe , in some detail , interactions McCabe was said to have had with Obama Justice Department officials about an investigation of the Clinton Foundation . It portrays McCabe as heroically trying to keep this investigation moving forward , over an unnamed Justice Department official ’ s resistance .
McCabe has now admitted to authorizing these leaks . And they were serious ones : They described internal deliberations about an ongoing investigation tied to a major-party presidential nominee and were let out just before a presidential election . The motivation now seems obvious : They were designed to prevent damage to McCabe and the FBI ’ s reputation from Barrett ’ s earlier article ( and a follow-up piece he was working on ) by portraying McCabe as tough on Clinton , and offering a juicy anecdote to prove it .
But the inspector general report claims that McCabe later displayed “ lack of candor ” to FBI and Justice Department officials about his role in these leaks , in at least four instances .
To Comey on October 31 , 2016 : The day after the latter Journal article published , Comey and McCabe privately discussed it and the leaks behind it . Comey later told the inspector general that McCabe left the impression that he wasn ’ t involved in the leak and he didn ’ t know who was . McCabe disputes this , claiming he fessed up to Comey , and that Comey agreed the leak was a “ good ” idea . The IG writes that the “ overwhelming weight ” of circumstantial evidence backs up Comey ’ s account , not McCabe ’ s . To the FBI ’ s Inspection Division investigators on May 9 , 2017 : A few months later , two FBI investigators questioned McCabe about the article , and asked about the leaks . The agents claim McCabe told them he had “ no idea ” where the story came from or who the source was — which , of course , would be a lie . McCabe disputes that this happened , and the interview wasn ’ t recorded . But both agents say this happened , one of them took notes , and they got McCabe to sign his initials on the Journal article , indicating that the topic was discussed . To the IG investigators on July 28 , 2017 : Later , investigators from the inspector general ’ s office questioned McCabe in a recorded interview , and presented him with texts from his subordinate Lisa Page indicating that she was involved in the leak . McCabe said he didn ’ t know who gave the information to the Wall Street Journal and that he wasn ’ t aware of her being authorized to do it . However , a few days after saying this , McCabe contacted investigators and said that after thinking about it more , he may have authorized the leak after all . ( Marcy Wheeler suggests that McCabe ’ s change of heart came because he realized those texts from Page made his previous , false story disclaiming knowledge of the leak untenable . ) To the IG investigators again on November 29 , 2017 : McCabe returned for another recorded interview with IG investigators , this time admitting his role in the leak . Yet Horowitz says he misled them about other matters . McCabe said in this interview that he ’ d told Comey about the leak and that Comey was okay with it on October 31 , 2016 , and claimed he never denied knowledge of the leaks to FBI investigators on May 9 , 2017 . Yet Horowitz doesn ’ t find either claim to be credible .
From the report , Horowitz clearly believes that McCabe tried to avoid being fingered for the leak by repeatedly misleading investigators and even Comey , his boss , about it . It is this report that Horowitz submitted to the FBI and that the Justice Department cited in firing McCabe in March , and that is reportedly the basis for the criminal referral .
President Trump ’ s opinions about McCabe are obviously widely known . Yet there is no indication that Horowitz , whose role is as an internal watchdog and who ’ s been in the job since 2012 , distorted his investigation to try to please the president . If McCabe truly did what Horowitz asserts , it would certainly be a firing offense and may well be criminal too .
McCabe has denied wrongdoing . His lawyer , Michael Bromwich , released a statement saying he is “ confident that , unless there is inappropriate pressure from high levels of the Administration , the US Attorney ’ s Office will conclude that it should decline to prosecute. ” A GoFundMe page for McCabe ’ s legal defense raised $ 567,996 last month .","The Justice Department’s inspector general has submitted a criminal referral for former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, according to CNN’s Pamela Brown.

Trump has gone after McCabe for unrelated reasons

To understand the full scope of what’s going on here, it’s useful to separate out President Trump’s gripes with Andrew McCabe from the inspector general’s critique of Andrew McCabe — because they’re quite different.

After the election (she lost), McCabe was involved in overseeing the Clinton email investigation, and conservatives questioned whether this was a conflict.

Mr. Comey is on a media tour selling his memoir , “ A Higher Loyalty . ”
Mr. Comey told Fox News Channel anchorman Bret Baier last week that Republicans first funded the Steele dossier and the money flow later shifted to unknown Democrats . This assertion is one that liberals often repeat to cast blame on Republicans for a dossier that makes a series of election collusion charges that remain publicly unconfirmed .
Mr. Baier : When did you learn that the DNC and Hillary Clinton campaign had funded Christopher Steele ’ s work ? Mr. Comey : Yes . I still don ’ t know that for a fact . Baier : What do you mean ? Mr. Comey : I ’ ve only seen it in the media . I never knew exactly which Democrats had funded . I knew it was funded first by Republicans . Mr. Baier : But that ’ s not true . Mr. Comey : I ’ m sorry ? Mr. Baier : That ’ s not true that the dossier that Christopher Steele worked on was funded by Republicans . Mr. Comey : My understanding was his work started funded by — as oppo research funded by Republicans .
The congressional and court records in this matter clearly show that Fusion GPS , a private investigative firm , received funds from a Republican donor to investigate Mr. Trump during the primary election season . When Mr. Trump secured the nomination , the funding stopped .
In June 2016 , Fusion went to the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign for opposition research funds . With money secured , Fusion hired Mr. Steele , a former British spy , who began submitting on June 20 the memos that eventually became the dossier .
His work was based on one or more intermediaries whom he paid to collect anti-Trump information from Kremlin spies . The dossier writing did not begin until the Democratic money started flowing to Fusion , via a law firm .
In a court filing in London , where he is being sued for libel , Mr. Steele provided this chronology : “ Between June and early November 2016 [ Steele ] was engaged by Fusion to prepare a series of confidential memoranda based on intelligence concerning Russian efforts to influence the U.S. presidential election process and links between Russia and Donald Trump . ”
Mr. Comey has offered no criticism of the dossier or Mr. Steele . Republicans call it a work of fiction that embroiled Mr. Trump in an investigation now headed by special counsel Robert Mueller .
Mr. Comey says the FBI did not receive any information from Mr. Steele until after “ late July . ”
This is important because the FBI and liberal media outlets are trying to downplay the dossier ’ s role , while Republicans say it drove and dominated the investigation .
“ Late July ” is the time the FBI officially opened a counterintelligence investigation based on a tip about George Papadopoulos , a Trump volunteer living in London .
“ The FBI didn ’ t get any information that ’ s part of the so-called Steele dossier , as I understand it , until after that , ” Mr. Comey told ABC News . “ And so the investigation was triggered entirely separately from the Steele dossier . ”
But available evidence shows Mr. Steele began funneling information well before late July . In fact , the dossier and other Democratic Party opposition research made up the driving force for the FBI investigation of the Trump campaign that summer and fall .
In late October , Mr. Steele did a Skype interview with Mother Jones magazine . He told reporter David Corn that he had sent his reports to the FBI “ near the start of July . ”
This is an apparent reference to a July 5 , 2016 , meeting Mr. Steele had in England with an FBI agent stationed in Rome . Mr. Steele handed him his reports on a supposed conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin .
The agent read them and remarked , “ I have to report this to headquarters , ” according to the book “ Russian Roulette . ”
That meeting was set up by Obama political appointees at the State Department who knew Mr. Steele from his reports to them on Ukraine .
Mr. Comey contended to Mr. Baier that he knew only that the dossier was funded by some unidentified Democrat during his tenure . His lack of firm knowledge extended to include briefing the president-elect on the dossier ’ s sleazy prostitute tale during a private meeting on Jan. 6 , 2017 , at Trump Tower in New York .
Mr. Comey took Mr. Trump aside to tell him about a report that Russia had compromising information on him . The then-FBI director never told the president-elect that the report was Democratic opposition research .
At the time , Mr. Comey claimed ignorance of the dossier ’ s true funding , but senior FBI and Justice Department officials knew it had been funded by the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign , according to the majority report of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence .
“ The political origins of the Steele dossier were then known to senior DoJ and FBI officials , ” the committee said , referring to the Oct. 21 , 2016 , wiretap warrant application filed by the bureau .
Republicans say the FBI abused the court process by using unverified material from the other party to spy on the Trump campaign .
Mr. Comey asserted that the investigation began in late July “ because of reliable information George Papadopoulos was having conversations about obtaining information from the Russians , ” he told ABC News .
Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI because he denied he was working for the campaign when he met Kremlin-connected people . He was in London trying to set up a grand meeting between the candidate and the Kremlin , maybe even Mr. Putin . He appeared to be freelancing rather than acting on explicit campaign orders .
The indictment doesn ’ t say he was trying to obtain information . It says that during a talk , a Kremlin-connected professor told Papadopoulos he heard the Kremlin owned thousands of Mrs. Clinton ’ s emails .
There has been no publicly released evidence that Papadopoulos or the campaign tried to acquire the emails , if they even existed . At the time , the Russians were hacking Democratic Party computers and stealing thousands of messages .
Mr. Baier asked Mr. Comey whether he had testified to lawmakers that agents did not believe former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn lied to them about the extent of his ties to Kremlin officials . This was how last week ’ s interview went :
Mr. Baier : Did you tell lawmakers that FBI agents didn ’ t believe former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was lying intentionally to investigators ? Mr. Comey : No . … And I saw that in the media . I don ’ t know what — maybe someone misunderstood something I said . I didn ’ t believe that and didn ’ t say that .
Mr. Comey ’ s answer was immediately challenged by people inside the closed House intelligence committee hearing room .
“ Director Comey ’ s recollection is flawed if he does not remember telling Congress that his agents told him that they didn ’ t think Flynn was lying , ” Rep.

He needs to get his lawyers and go back and look at the transcript . We did not mishear . Maybe he misspoke , but that is in the transcript . ”
Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about two phone calls with the Russian ambassador . He was fired by Mr. Trump for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the calls concerning U.S. sanctions on individual Russians and their businesses . Flynn is awaiting sentencing .
Mr. Comey tweeted on Thursday , the day his Fox News interviewed was broadcast , “ The last two weeks were a reminder of the vital role of the press and of open-minded , respectful conversation in our lives . I ’ m grateful for good and tough questions from reporters across the spectrum and around the world . Look forward to more . ”","ANALYSIS:

Fired FBI Director James B. Comey has provided a number of assertions about the Trump-Russia investigation that conflict with the historical record.

Whether it involves who paid for the dossier that repeated salacious and unproven claims about President Trump, what Mr. Comey knew about the funding, and when author Christopher Steele first met with the FBI, the former director has provided his version of facts that critics say are wrong.

Mr. Comey is on a media tour selling his memoir, “A Higher Loyalty.”

Dossier funding

Mr. Comey told Fox News Channel anchorman Bret Baier last week that Republicans first funded the Steele dossier and the money flow later shifted to unknown Democrats. This assertion is one that liberals often repeat to cast blame on Republicans for a dossier that makes a series of election collusion charges that remain publicly unconfirmed.

Here was their dialogue:

Mr. Baier: When did you learn that the DNC and Hillary Clinton campaign had funded Christopher Steele’s work? Mr. Comey: Yes. I still don’t know that for a fact. Baier: What do you mean? Mr. Comey: I’ve only seen it in the media. I never knew exactly which Democrats had funded. I knew it was funded first by Republicans. Mr. Baier: But that’s not true. Mr. Comey: I’m sorry? Mr. Baier: That’s not true that the dossier that Christopher Steele worked on was funded by Republicans. Mr. Comey: My understanding was his work started funded by — as oppo research funded by Republicans.

The congressional and court records in this matter clearly show that Fusion GPS, a private investigative firm, received funds from a Republican donor to investigate Mr. Trump during the primary election season. When Mr. Trump secured the nomination, the funding stopped.

In June 2016, Fusion went to the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign for opposition research funds. With money secured, Fusion hired Mr. Steele, a former British spy, who began submitting on June 20 the memos that eventually became the dossier.

His work was based on one or more intermediaries whom he paid to collect anti-Trump information from Kremlin spies. The dossier writing did not begin until the Democratic money started flowing to Fusion, via a law firm.

In a court filing in London, where he is being sued for libel, Mr. Steele provided this chronology: “Between June and early November 2016 [Steele] was engaged by Fusion to prepare a series of confidential memoranda based on intelligence concerning Russian efforts to influence the U.S. presidential election process and links between Russia and Donald Trump.”

Mr. Comey has offered no criticism of the dossier or Mr. Steele. Republicans call it a work of fiction that embroiled Mr. Trump in an investigation now headed by special counsel Robert Mueller.

Steele-FBI marriage

Mr. Comey says the FBI did not receive any information from Mr. Steele until after “late July.”

This is important because the FBI and liberal media outlets are trying to downplay the dossier’s role, while Republicans say it drove and dominated the investigation.

“Late July” is the time the FBI officially opened a counterintelligence investigation based on a tip about George Papadopoulos, a Trump volunteer living in London.

“The FBI didn’t get any information that’s part of the so-called Steele dossier, as I understand it, until after that,” Mr. Comey told ABC News. “And so the investigation was triggered entirely separately from the Steele dossier.”

But available evidence shows Mr. Steele began funneling information well before late July. In fact, the dossier and other Democratic Party opposition research made up the driving force for the FBI investigation of the Trump campaign that summer and fall.

In late October, Mr. Steele did a Skype interview with Mother Jones magazine. He told reporter David Corn that he had sent his reports to the FBI “near the start of July.”

This is an apparent reference to a July 5, 2016, meeting Mr. Steele had in England with an FBI agent stationed in Rome. Mr. Steele handed him his reports on a supposed conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.

The agent read them and remarked, “I have to report this to headquarters,” according to the book “Russian Roulette.”

That meeting was set up by Obama political appointees at the State Department who knew Mr. Steele from his reports to them on Ukraine.

In the dark

Mr. Comey contended to Mr. Baier that he knew only that the dossier was funded by some unidentified Democrat during his tenure. His lack of firm knowledge extended to include briefing the president-elect on the dossier’s sleazy prostitute tale during a private meeting on Jan. 6, 2017, at Trump Tower in New York.

Mr. Comey took Mr. Trump aside to tell him about a report that Russia had compromising information on him. The then-FBI director never told the president-elect that the report was Democratic opposition research.

At the time, Mr. Comey claimed ignorance of the dossier’s true funding, but senior FBI and Justice Department officials knew it had been funded by the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign, according to the majority report of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.

“The political origins of the Steele dossier were then known to senior DoJ and FBI officials,” the committee said, referring to the Oct. 21, 2016, wiretap warrant application filed by the bureau.

Republicans say the FBI abused the court process by using unverified material from the other party to spy on the Trump campaign.

Papadopoulos

Mr. Comey asserted that the investigation began in late July “because of reliable information George Papadopoulos was having conversations about obtaining information from the Russians,” he told ABC News.

Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI because he denied he was working for the campaign when he met Kremlin-connected people. He was in London trying to set up a grand meeting between the candidate and the Kremlin, maybe even Mr. Putin. He appeared to be freelancing rather than acting on explicit campaign orders.

The indictment doesn’t say he was trying to obtain information. It says that during a talk, a Kremlin-connected professor told Papadopoulos he heard the Kremlin owned thousands of Mrs. Clinton’s emails.

There has been no publicly released evidence that Papadopoulos or the campaign tried to acquire the emails, if they even existed. At the time, the Russians were hacking Democratic Party computers and stealing thousands of messages.

Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn

Mr. Baier asked Mr. Comey whether he had testified to lawmakers that agents did not believe former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn lied to them about the extent of his ties to Kremlin officials. This was how last week’s interview went:

Mr. Baier: Did you tell lawmakers that FBI agents didn’t believe former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was lying intentionally to investigators? Mr. Comey: No. … And I saw that in the media. I don’t know what — maybe someone misunderstood something I said. I didn’t believe that and didn’t say that.

Mr. Comey’s answer was immediately challenged by people inside the closed House intelligence committee hearing room.

“Director Comey’s recollection is flawed if he does not remember telling Congress that his agents told him that they didn’t think Flynn was lying,” Rep. Trey Gowdy, South Carolina Republican, told Fox News Channel’s Tucker Carlson. “Director Comey’s recollection is flawed if he does not remember telling Congress that his agents told him that they didn’t think Flynn was lying.

Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about two phone calls with the Russian ambassador. He was fired by Mr. Trump for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the calls concerning U.S. sanctions on individual Russians and their businesses. Flynn is awaiting sentencing.

House Overnight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz first urged such a probe during Thursday ’ s hearing with Comey before his committee . He wants the agency to investigate whether Clinton lied when she told lawmakers “ there was nothing marked classified on my emails ” – a claim Comey repeatedly contradicted this week .
Comey told Chaffetz a referral from Congress would be needed for an investigation .
“ You ’ ll have one in the next few hours , ” Chaffetz said .
When FoxNews.com contacted Chaffetz ’ s office on Friday , a referral had not yet been sent .
But Chaffetz is vowing to kick-start the process , and his Republican colleagues are voicing support .
Rep. Jim Jordan , R-Ohio , told Fox News a day earlier that Clinton “ made statements that [ were ] directly contradicted by what Mr. Comey ’ s investigation covered . ”
“ There are a number of things that she said that are just false based on the investigation Mr. Comey conducted relative to her testimony under oath to us last October , ” Jordan said , adding he thinks it would be “ appropriate ” to look into perjury claims but the decision is ultimately up to Chaffetz and Rep. Trey Gowdy , who chairs the Benghazi committee .
It was during an exchange with Gowdy that Comey on Thursday countered several statements Clinton had made , both in public and before the Benghazi committee .
Notably , he said her statement that nothing she sent or received was marked classified was not true . To the contrary , Comey confirmed the FBI 's investigation found at least three emails with classified markings on Clinton 's server .
The State Department says human error was responsible for those markings . In a statement after Thursday ’ s hearing , Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon claimed Comey ’ s testimony “ clearly knocked down a number of false Republican talking points and reconciled apparent contradictions between his previous remarks and Hillary Clinton 's public statements . ”
Yet the stepped-up calls to dig deeper into Clinton ’ s statements signal the investigations concerning Clinton ’ s conduct in office are not over – even as lawmakers on Friday approved a final report on the deadly 2012 attacks in Benghazi , Libya .
The two-year inquiry , among many other details , had revealed she used a private email server for government business , setting off intense scrutiny that continues to dog Clinton 's presidential campaign . The 7-4 vote to approve the 800-page report was split along party lines , reflecting partisanship that emerged after the panel 's creation in May 2014 and escalated in this election year . Democrats have submitted their own report on the attacks , which killed four Americans , including U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens .
Gowdy , R-S.C. , echoing Chaffetz , also said lawmakers may seek a federal investigation into whether Clinton lied to the committee in testimony last year .
`` Our committee has an obligation '' to report any untruthful testimony to the FBI , Gowdy said .
Asked if he was referring to Clinton , Gowdy said , `` She 's one of 100 witnesses . ''
Under oath , Clinton testified last October that she never sent or received emails marked as classified when she served as secretary of state . She also said she only used one mobile device for emails and turned over all of her work-related emails to the State Department , claims Comey also contradicted on Thursday .
Separately , the State Department is reopening its internal investigation of possible mishandling of classified information by Clinton and top aides . The internal review was suspended in April to avoid interfering with the FBI inquiry .

Comey said Thursday that his team found no evidence that Clinton lied under oath to the FBI or broke the law by discussing classified information in an unclassified setting .
Under an onslaught of Republican criticism , Comey vigorously defended the government 's decision and rejected GOP accusations that the presidential candidate was given special treatment .

“ Democrats have been the best gun salesmen of the year , ” said Alan Gottlieb , founder of Second Amendment Foundation , a pro-gun group .
The FBI conducted more than 28.3 million background checks last year through its National Instant Criminal Background Checks Systems , or NICS . That represents a 3 % increase from the record 27.5 million set in presidential election year 2016 .
December was the bureau ’ s second-highest month ever for gun background checks , with more than 2.9 million . The December numbers reflect a ramp-up in gun sales toward the end of the year . On Black Friday alone — Nov. 29 — the FBI ran 202,465 background checks .
NICS checks are largely viewed as an indicator of gun sales .
With the 2020 elections 11 months away and nearly every Democratic presidential candidate proposing stricter access to firearms , gun sales appear to be increasing .
“ We ’ ve been very , very busy this year and in particular , December , ” said Larry Hyatt , owner of Hyatt Guns in North Carolina .
“ The biggest reason is political with the elections in November and rhetoric in the news media . Before we had candidates talking about registering guns , now we ’ ve got candidates talking about confiscating a gun . ”
Mr. Hyatt ticked off several other reasons for his store ’ s sales increase , including an improved economy and increased inventory offered by suppliers .
Shortly after President Trump took office , the gun industry suffered through what was called the “ Trump slump. ” Firearms enthusiasts no longer feared a crackdown , which had led to a massive sales surge during the Obama administration .
The field of Democrats running for the White House have offered a litany of gun control proposals . Perhaps the most startling to gun owners was former Texas Rep. Beto O ’ Rourke ’ s call for a mandatory buyback program of AR- and AK-style rifles .
“ Hell , yes , we ’ re going to take your AR-15 , your AK-47 , ” Mr. O ’ Rourke said in September , just before dropping out of the race .
Now that the calendar has flipped to an election year , analysts expect sales to top 2019 . Small Arms Analytics , which provides data to the gun industry , estimates 14.4 million firearms will be sold in 2020 , falling just shy of the 2016 record of 16.6 million .
“ For gun owners , the election cycle has already started , ” Mr. Gottlieb said . “ Their rights have already been under attack , and you are seeing record turnouts at meetings around the country . ”
David Chipman , a senior policy adviser at Giffords , an organization advocating for stronger gun laws , said the FBI data is misleading .
The NICS numbers include permit checks and rechecks for concealed carry permits , which is inflating the numbers , he said . Mr. Chipman also pointed to slight increases in handgun purchases and a decrease in sales for long guns , a specific firearm with a longer barrel .
“ If you report the FBI is busier this year , that is absolutely right . But if you suggest this is indicative of the gun market , I ’ d say beware , ” he said . “ Based on my view of the data , gun sales have flatlined . ”
The NICS system was created after the passage of the Brady bill , which mandated background checks for firearms purchases .

Hogan Gidley ripped the FBI in an interview with Fox News on Friday , saying the bureau has an `` extreme bias '' against President Trump Donald John TrumpDem lawmaker says Nunes threatened to sue him over criticism Parnas : U.S. ambassador to Ukraine removed to clear path for investigations into Bidens Five takeaways from Parnas 's Maddow interview MORE in the wake of the release of anti-Trump text messages between two FBI officials .
`` It is troubling , deeply troubling , that the revelations have now come to light that there is extreme bias against this president with high-up members of the team there at the FBI who were investigating Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonWarren-Sanders fight raises alarm on the left Poll : Trump trails 2020 Democratic contenders in Michigan US company offers free cybersecurity assistance to campaigns MORE at the time , '' Gidley said on `` Fox & Friends . ''
`` We 're a little concerned at what we 're seeing here . Obviously , those text messages give us quite a bit of pause and should be eye-opening at an agency that should be , quite frankly unbiased , '' he added .
Gidley 's comments come after more than 300 text messages between senior FBI counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok — who was assigned to the bureau 's investigation into Clinton 's private email server she used as secretary of State — and in-house attorney Lisa Page were provided to Congress , after they were provided to the press .
Fox News first reported on the text messages on Dec. 6 , saying more than 10,000 texts between Page and Strzok had been found and were under review .
Strzok had been assigned to the special counsel investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election , though he has since been pulled from that duty .

Gidley's comments come after more than 300 text messages between senior FBI counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok — who was assigned to the bureau's investigation into Clinton's private email server she used as secretary of State — and in-house attorney Lisa Page were provided to Congress, after they were provided to the press.

Fox News first reported on the text messages on Dec. 6, saying more than 10,000 texts between Page and Strzok had been found and were under review.

Strzok had been assigned to the special counsel investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, though he has since been pulled from that duty.

The Department of Justice said on Thursday that it did not authorize the release of the text messages, which show Strzok and Page openly criticizing Trump and other lawmakers during the election and supporting Clinton.

Strzok called Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) ""an idiot like Trump,"" and Page called Trump ""a loathsome human.""

WASHINGTON – In FBI parlance, they are called “spins.”

They are special investigations into the backgrounds of nominees to the Supreme Court and other high profile jobs in any presidential administration.

Perhaps never before has such attention been focused on the long-shrouded process than in the case of Brett Kavanaugh.

And Friday brought a new and unexpected wrinkle: Republican senators and President Donald Trump acquiesced to Democrats’ demand for the re-opening of Kavanaugh’s background inquiry to vet allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee leveled by high school acquaintance Christine Blasey Ford.

While an extraordinary Senate Judiciary Committee hearing did little to reconcile the dueling accounts offered by Ford and Kavanaugh, lawmakers now believe that a clearer picture of the nominee’s credibility would likely emerge and Trump Friday authorized a ""limited"" one-week FBI review.

Only the White House was authorized to re-open the background review, closed long before Ford’s allegations were made public. But even in the narrow amount of time provided by Trump, former FBI officials said agents could reach a quick resolution.

“They could knock this thing out in a couple of days,” said Jim Davis, a former agent who participated in at least 50 such background inquiries. “The great and beautiful thing about the FBI is that it can apply incredible resources to whatever the issue requires.”

Phil Mudd, a former CIA and FBI official who has been the subject of a half-dozen background checks, said such re-investigation is common and can be completed fairly quickly.

""You have to let things go where they go, but if it is narrow in scope it could take just a few days,"" Mudd said.

Apart from Ford, among the first witnesses likely to be contacted by investigators is Kavanaugh's high school friend, Mark Judge, who Ford claims was in the room when she was assaulted at a house party in the Washington, D.C. suburbs in 1982.

Ford told the Senate panel that while she was allegedly being assaulted by Kavanaugh, she made eye contact with Judge who she had hoped would come to her aid.

Democrats had unsuccessfully sought to have Judge testify at Thursday's hearing.

Judge, in a statement Friday, said he would ""cooperate with any law enforcement agency that is assigned to confidentially investigate these allegations.""

Judge had previously told the committee in a sworn statement that he had ""no memory"" of the incident outlined by Ford.

In her testimony, Ford identified two others who were allegedly present at the party, P.J. Smyth and Leland Ingham Keyser. Both of them also have issued statements indicating that they no recollection of the party.

Davis, the former FBI agent, said all of those identified as being present at the party would almost certainly be interviewed, as well the people who Ford told of the incident.

Prior to Thursday's hearing, Ford's attorneys provided the Senate committee with sworn declarations from four people, including Ford's husband, who said that Ford had shared details of the incident and Kavanaugh's alleged involvement with them.

Ford's husband, Russell Ford, said he first learned of his wife's experience with sexual assault ""around the time we got married."" However, he said Ford did not share details of the incident until a couple's therapy session in 2012.

""I remember her saying that her attacker's name was Brett Kavanaugh, that he was a successful lawyer who had grown up in Christine's hometown, and that he was well known in the Washington, D.C., community,"" Russell Ford said.

It was unclear whether the scope of an FBI inquiry would allow for the review of other allegations leveled by former Yale classmate, Deborah Ramirez, who claimed that Kavanaugh exposed himself at a drunken party during the 1983-84 academic year.

Another woman, Julie Swetnick, has alleged that in the 1980s she witnessed Kavanaugh and Judge attempt to ply teenage girls with alcohol at wild parties where girls were sexually abused.

She did not say Kavanaugh or Judge sexually assaulted her.

Kavanaugh has denied all of the allegations.

In his statement Friday, Judge said he did not recall attending the parties.

""The allegations in the Swetnick affidavit are so bizarre that, even while suffering from my addiction, I would remember actions so outlandish. I categorically deny them,"" he said.

Kavanaugh has said that Judge struggled with alcohol addiction.

""The FBI is going to put together a list, and you can bet that all of the people whose names have been floated out there are going to be on it,"" said Ray Mey, a former FBI agent who conducted dozens of background checks during his tenure at the bureau.
