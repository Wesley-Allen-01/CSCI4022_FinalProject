In a demonstration of unbridled self-interest and bottomless bad faith, the Trump White House and its Republican minions in Congress are on the cusp of releasing a “memo” that purports to document the biggest political scandal since Watergate. To pull it off, they are undermining the credibility of the law enforcement community that Republicans once defended so ardently, on the noble-sounding claim that the American public must know the truth.

Don’t fall for it.

Reports suggest that the three-and-a-half-page document — produced by the staff of Representative Devin Nunes (R-White House), who somehow still leads the House Intelligence Committee despite his own record of shilling for President Trump, and who is supposed to be recused from these matters — has nothing to do with truth or accountability.

How did the investigators manage this feat? By relying on a dossier prepared by a former British intelligence agent, Christopher Steele, but hiding from the court that Mr. Steele’s work was being funded by Democrats, including Hillary Clinton’s campaign, and thus was hopelessly biased.

They debated a range of possibilities , according to portions of transcripts of two FBI officials ' closed-door congressional interviews obtained by CNN . On one end was the idea that Trump fired Comey at the behest of Russia . On the other was the possibility that Trump did n't have an improper relationship with the Kremlin and was acting within the bounds of his executive authority , the transcripts show .
James Baker , then-FBI general counsel , said the FBI officials were contemplating with regard to Russia whether Trump was `` acting at the behest of and somehow following directions , somehow executing their will . ''
`` That was one extreme . The other extreme is that the President is completely innocent , and we discussed that too , '' Baker told House investigators last year . `` There 's a range of things this could possibly be . We need to investigate , because we do n't know whether , you know , the worst-case scenario is possibly true or the President is totally innocent and we need to get this thing over with — and so he can move forward with his agenda . ''
Following Comey 's firing , the FBI opened a probe into Trump for possible obstruction of justice , as CNN has previously reported . Part of the impetus for the investigation , the New York Times first reported Friday , was whether Trump 's actions seemed to benefit Russia .
The congressional transcripts obtained by CNN reveal new details into how the FBI launched the investigation into Trump and the discussions that were going on inside the bureau during a tumultuous and pivotal period ahead of the internal investigation and special counsel Robert Mueller 's appointment .
Republicans view the officials ' comments as evidence that top officials at the FBI were planning all along to investigate Trump and that the probe was n't sparked by the Comey firing , according to a Republican source with knowledge of the interviews .
While the FBI launched its investigation in the days after Comey 's abrupt dismissal , the bureau had previously contemplated such a step , according to testimony from former FBI lawyer Lisa Page .
Peter Strzok , the former FBI agent who was dismissed from Mueller 's team and later fired over anti-Trump text messages , texted Page in the hours after Comey 's firing and said : `` We need to open the case we 've been waiting on now while Andy is acting , '' a reference to then-acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe .
Page was pressed on the meaning of the message in her interview with congressional investigators , and she confirmed that the text was related to the Russia investigation into potential collusion .
Page told lawmakers the decision to open the case was not about `` who was occupying the director 's chair , '' according to a source . While FBI lawyers limited her answers about the text , she said the text was n't suggesting that the case could n't be opened with Comey as director .
`` It 's not that it could not have been done , '' Page told lawmakers . `` This case had been a topic of discussion for some time . The 'waiting on ' was an indecision and a cautiousness on the part of the bureau with respect to what to do and whether there was sufficient predication to open . ''
Portions of Page 's interview were first reported by The Epoch Times .
This weekend , Trump in a series of tweets attacked the FBI and Comey , calling him a `` crooked cop . ''
`` Wow , just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI , almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons , opened up an investigation on me , for no reason & with no proof , after I fired Lyin ' James Comey , a total sleaze ! '' Trump tweeted
In his congressional testimony , Baker said that he did not discuss with Comey the possibility that Russia had influenced his firing . But Baker met with a group of roughly a half-dozen officials , including McCabe and possibly Strzok and Page , to discuss it .
`` Not only would it be an issue of obstructing an investigation , but the obstruction itself would hurt our ability to figure out what the Russians had done , and that is what would be the threat to national security , '' Baker told lawmakers , according to an excerpt from the transcript first reported by the Times and confirmed by CNN .
Baker said the notion that Trump was acting at the behest of Russia was `` discussed as a theoretical possibility . ''
`` I 'm speaking theoretically . If the President of the United States fired Jim Comey at the behest of the Russian government , that would be unlawful and unconstitutional , '' Baker said .
`` Is that what happened here ? '' Rep. John Ratcliffe , a Texas Republican , asked Baker .
`` I do n't know , '' Baker responded , before the FBI lawyer cut off additional questions on that line of inquiry .
Representatives for Baker , Page , Strzok and McCabe declined to comment .
Comey 's firing was n't the only development that prompted the investigation into Trump , according to the Times , as Trump subsequently tied Comey 's firing to the Russia investigation on two separate occasions before the investigation was launched , including in an NBC News interview two days after Comey 's dismissal .
Republicans asked in their interviews with FBI officials questions about the fact that both Comey and McCabe kept memos detailing their conversations with Trump , a step they did n't take with President Barack Obama . Comey 's memos , in which he wrote that Trump suggested Comey drop the probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn , were leaked by a friend of Comey after his firing in an effort to spark the appointment of a special counsel .
When Page was asked about McCabe 's memos , she acknowledged she had reviewed some of them , though she said it was mostly for proofreading . House Republicans issued a subpoena for McCabe 's memos last year , but the Justice Department did not hand them over , according to a source familiar with the congressional investigation .
In his interview with House investigators , Comey was pressed on why he made memos of his conversations with Trump about an ongoing investigation , but not Obama . Comey responded that Obama discussed the Hillary Clinton email investigation `` on Fox News '' and he did n't need to memorialize such a public comment .
`` The public comments , because they were widely broadcast , were ones that were apparent to the senior leadership team of the FBI , '' Comey said . `` If I did n't tell the senior leadership team of the FBI about my conversation with President Trump , they would n't otherwise know and could n't help me figure out what to do with what was potential obstruction of justice .

fbi,Washington Times,2,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/feb/4/trey-gowdy-says-fbi-concealed-clinton-role-steele-/,Rep. Trey Gowdy: FBI concealed Clinton role in Steele dossier,2018-02-04,Tom Howell Jr.,"The House ’ s top investigator on Sunday said the FBI failed to notify a surveillance court that it was relying on material backed by the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign when it asked to snoop on a former adviser to the Trump campaign .
Rep. Trey Gowdy , South Carolina Republican , also said judges wouldn ’ t have authorized and repeatedly renewed a warrant to spy on the former campaign aide , Carter Page , if it hadn ’ t been for the material in that very dossier , compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele .
The revelations shouldn ’ t upend investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election , the congressman said , but he thinks the FBI erred by failing to disclose their sources ’ anti-Trump agenda in a footnote on their evidence .
“ They could have easily said it was the DNC and Hillary Clinton . That would have been really easy , ” Mr. Gowdy told CBS ’ s “ Face the Nation. ” “ It took longer to explain it the way they did than if they just came right out and said , ‘ Hillary Clinton for America and DNC paid for it. ’ But they didn ’ t do that . ”
Mr. Gowdy was involved in drafting a bombshell memo that details the FBI ’ s decision to use the Clinton-backed material to try to spy on Mr . Page in October 2016 . It also explores the role of top FBI and Justice Department officials in seeking and renewing those snooping powers .
President Trump said the memo “ totally vindicates ” him as he is dogged by claims that his 2016 campaign colluded with Russia .
SEE ALSO : Memo on FBI surveillance of Trump campaign turns up heat on Deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein
House Speaker Paul D. Ryan , Wisconsin Republican , and Mr. Gowdy say that wasn ’ t the point of the memo . Yet it has kicked up a political firestorm , with Democrats chastising its lead author — Rep. Devin Nunes , California Republican and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence — for pulling back the curtain on the secretive U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and its sensitive processes .
They say the four-page memo amounts to an incomplete “ hit job ” designed to sow doubt about investigations into the Trump campaign ’ s interactions with Russians .
Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer , New York Democrat , told Mr. Trump on Sunday to support the release of a paper by Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California that serves as a Democratic rebuttal to Mr. Nunes ’ memo , which was released Friday with White House approval .
Republicans on the House intelligence committee voted to reject Mr. Schiff ’ s memo , even as they green-lighted their own .
“ I believe it is a matter of fundamental fairness that the American people be allowed to see both sides of the argument and make their own judgments , ” Mr. Schumer said .
He said the Schiff memo sheds new light on why the FBI felt it needed to watch Mr . Page and his interactions with Russians .
“ I get that Adam Schiff and others are worried about what ’ s not in my memo . I wish that they were equally concerned about what ’ s not in the FISA application , which is a lot of really important information about the source , and its subsources , and the fact that he was hired by the DNC and the Clinton campaign , and the fact that he was biased against President Trump , ” said Mr. Gowdy , who last week said he will return to the legal field instead of seeking re-election .
“ I would argue it ’ s also somewhat unprecedented to rely on political opposition research to instruct and inform an application . And it ’ s really bad precedent and unprecedented to not tell a court that a source has this level of bias , ” he said .
Mr. Gowdy said he hopes the revealing memo is a “ one-off , ” but he also thinks it ’ s important to detail how the FBI sought its snooping powers because FISA judges don ’ t perform independent research .
He is among the top Republicans preaching caution , even as Mr. Trump ’ s conservative allies say heads should roll at the FBI and Justice Department .
After the memo was released Friday , Mr. Trump told reporters that the FBI ’ s conduct was a disgrace . He refused to say whether he had confidence in Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , who signed at least one of the surveillance applications and later appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel to investigate the Russia accusations .
Senate Democrats say any move to upend the Russia investigations would cross a red line akin the 1973 “ Saturday Night Massacre , ” in which President Nixon ’ s attorney general and his deputy opted to resign rather than carry out the president ’ s order to fire Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox .
“ To say that that ’ s the end of the investigation , that this is all that Donald Trump needs to fire Rosenstein or to fire Bob Mueller , I ’ ll just tell you , this could precipitate a constitutional crisis , ” Senate Minority Whip Richard J. Durbin , Illinois Democrat , told CNN ’ s “ State of the Union . ”
The New York Times recently reported that Mr. Trump ordered Mr. Mueller ’ s firing in June , only to back off when the White House counsel threatened to resign .
Former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus , who was ousted in July , said he never got the sense that Mr. Trump wanted to or tried to get rid of Mr. Mueller .
“ I never heard the idea or the concept that this person needed to be fired . I never felt that it was relayed to me that way either , ” Mr. Priebus told NBC ’ s “ Meet the Press. ” “ And I would know the difference between a level-10 situation , as reported in that story , and what was reality . And it just , to me , it wasn ’ t reality . ”
Mr. Gowdy took pains to divorce his work on the Nunes memo from the Mueller investigation , which he said goes far beyond the Steele dossier .
“ There is a Russia investigation without a dossier , ” he said , rattling off a list of other events , such as a mysterious meeting between a Russian lawyer and Trump officials at Trump Tower .
The Republican memo says the FBI dug into the Trump campaign after another one of its aides , George Papadopoulos , reportedly boasted in mid-2016 that Russia had dirt on Mrs. Clinton .
Furthermore , Mr. Gowdy said the Republican memo “ doesn ’ t have anything to do with obstruction of justice , ” something Mr. Mueller is reportedly exploring after Mr. Trump fired FBI Director James B. Comey last year .
Democrats have warned Mr. Trump not to use the memo to terminate Mr. Rosenstein , too , saying it would cross a red line .
Richard Painter , the chief ethics attorney for President George W. Bush , said the public outcry over Mr. Rosenstein ’ s firing might be enough to stop the president from pulling the trigger .
“ If he wants to fire Rosenstein , it will get ugly , ” Mr. Painter said . “ He ’ ll just dig himself into a bigger hole with obstruction accusations because it will seem like he ’ s firing Rosenstein to get at Mueller .

“ Ohr later provided the FBI with all of his wife ’ s opposition research , paid for by the DNC and Clinton campaign via Fusion GPS , ” the memo stated . “ The Ohrs ’ relationship with Steele and Fusion GPS was inexplicably concealed from the [ court ] . ”
In September 2016 , Mr. Steele acknowledged to Mr. Ohr his dislike for then-candidate Trump , saying he was “ desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president , ” the memo said .
“ This clear evidence of Steele ’ s bias was recorded by Ohr at the time and subsequently in official FBI files but not reflected in any of the Page FISA applications , ” the Nunes memo said .","The House’s top investigator on Sunday said the FBI failed to notify a surveillance court that it was relying on material backed by the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign when it asked to snoop on a former adviser to the Trump campaign.

Rep. Trey Gowdy, South Carolina Republican, also said judges wouldn’t have authorized and repeatedly renewed a warrant to spy on the former campaign aide, Carter Page, if it hadn’t been for the material in that very dossier, compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele.

The revelations shouldn’t upend investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, the congressman said, but he thinks the FBI erred by failing to disclose their sources’ anti-Trump agenda in a footnote on their evidence.

“They could have easily said it was the DNC and Hillary Clinton. That would have been really easy,” Mr. Gowdy told CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “It took longer to explain it the way they did than if they just came right out and said, ‘Hillary Clinton for America and DNC paid for it.’ But they didn’t do that.”

Mr. Gowdy was involved in drafting a bombshell memo that details the FBI’s decision to use the Clinton-backed material to try to spy on Mr. Page in October 2016. It also explores the role of top FBI and Justice Department officials in seeking and renewing those snooping powers.

President Trump said the memo “totally vindicates” him as he is dogged by claims that his 2016 campaign colluded with Russia.

House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, and Mr. Gowdy say that wasn’t the point of the memo. Yet it has kicked up a political firestorm, with Democrats chastising its lead author — Rep. Devin Nunes, California Republican and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence — for pulling back the curtain on the secretive U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and its sensitive processes.

They say the four-page memo amounts to an incomplete “hit job” designed to sow doubt about investigations into the Trump campaign’s interactions with Russians.

Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, told Mr. Trump on Sunday to support the release of a paper by Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California that serves as a Democratic rebuttal to Mr. Nunes’ memo, which was released Friday with White House approval.

Republicans on the House intelligence committee voted to reject Mr. Schiff’s memo, even as they green-lighted their own.

“I believe it is a matter of fundamental fairness that the American people be allowed to see both sides of the argument and make their own judgments,” Mr. Schumer said.

He said the Schiff memo sheds new light on why the FBI felt it needed to watch Mr. Page and his interactions with Russians.

Mr. Gowdy said Democrats are the ones being one-sided.

“I get that Adam Schiff and others are worried about what’s not in my memo. I wish that they were equally concerned about what’s not in the FISA application, which is a lot of really important information about the source, and its subsources, and the fact that he was hired by the DNC and the Clinton campaign, and the fact that he was biased against President Trump,” said Mr. Gowdy, who last week said he will return to the legal field instead of seeking re-election.

“I would argue it’s also somewhat unprecedented to rely on political opposition research to instruct and inform an application. And it’s really bad precedent and unprecedented to not tell a court that a source has this level of bias,” he said.

Mr. Gowdy said he hopes the revealing memo is a “one-off,” but he also thinks it’s important to detail how the FBI sought its snooping powers because FISA judges don’t perform independent research.

He is among the top Republicans preaching caution, even as Mr. Trump’s conservative allies say heads should roll at the FBI and Justice Department.

After the memo was released Friday, Mr. Trump told reporters that the FBI’s conduct was a disgrace. He refused to say whether he had confidence in Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who signed at least one of the surveillance applications and later appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel to investigate the Russia accusations.

Senate Democrats say any move to upend the Russia investigations would cross a red line akin the 1973 “Saturday Night Massacre,” in which President Nixon’s attorney general and his deputy opted to resign rather than carry out the president’s order to fire Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox.

“To say that that’s the end of the investigation, that this is all that Donald Trump needs to fire Rosenstein or to fire Bob Mueller, I’ll just tell you, this could precipitate a constitutional crisis,” Senate Minority Whip Richard J. Durbin, Illinois Democrat, told CNN’s “State of the Union.”

The New York Times recently reported that Mr. Trump ordered Mr. Mueller’s firing in June, only to back off when the White House counsel threatened to resign.

Former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, who was ousted in July, said he never got the sense that Mr. Trump wanted to or tried to get rid of Mr. Mueller.

“I never heard the idea or the concept that this person needed to be fired. I never felt that it was relayed to me that way either,” Mr. Priebus told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “And I would know the difference between a level-10 situation, as reported in that story, and what was reality. And it just, to me, it wasn’t reality.”

Mr. Gowdy took pains to divorce his work on the Nunes memo from the Mueller investigation, which he said goes far beyond the Steele dossier.

“There is a Russia investigation without a dossier,” he said, rattling off a list of other events, such as a mysterious meeting between a Russian lawyer and Trump officials at Trump Tower.

The Republican memo says the FBI dug into the Trump campaign after another one of its aides, George Papadopoulos, reportedly boasted in mid-2016 that Russia had dirt on Mrs. Clinton.

Furthermore, Mr. Gowdy said the Republican memo “doesn’t have anything to do with obstruction of justice,” something Mr. Mueller is reportedly exploring after Mr. Trump fired FBI Director James B. Comey last year.

Democrats have warned Mr. Trump not to use the memo to terminate Mr. Rosenstein, too, saying it would cross a red line.

Richard Painter, the chief ethics attorney for President George W. Bush, said the public outcry over Mr. Rosenstein’s firing might be enough to stop the president from pulling the trigger.

“If he wants to fire Rosenstein, it will get ugly,” Mr. Painter said. “He’ll just dig himself into a bigger hole with obstruction accusations because it will seem like he’s firing Rosenstein to get at Mueller. The advice I would give him is to leave it alone. If the president just stops, that could minimize his exposure to possible obstruction of justice.”

The Nunes memo largely focuses on Mr. Steele’s role and conflicts of interest that pointed to a pattern of bias against Mr. Trump.

Mr. Steele said he obtained information about Mr. Trump from unidentified officials at the Kremlin in Moscow. His dossier was eventually given to Fusion GPS, a liberal research firm funded by the Clinton campaign and DNC.

Then-deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe told the House intelligence committee in December that a surveillance warrant for Mr. Page would not have been sought without the information from Mr. Steele.

Mr. McCabe retired earlier than expected on Jan. 29, one day after FBI Director Christopher Wray saw the memo.

The document also details a partisan conflict of then-Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr, who was in contact with Mr. Steele while Mr. Ohr’s wife was employed by Fusion GPS “to assist in the cultivation of opposition research on Trump” for Mrs. Clinton.

“Ohr later provided the FBI with all of his wife’s opposition research, paid for by the DNC and Clinton campaign via Fusion GPS,” the memo stated. “The Ohrs’ relationship with Steele and Fusion GPS was inexplicably concealed from the [court].”

In September 2016, Mr. Steele acknowledged to Mr. Ohr his dislike for then-candidate Trump, saying he was “desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president,” the memo said.

“This clear evidence of Steele’s bias was recorded by Ohr at the time and subsequently in official FBI files but not reflected in any of the Page FISA applications,” the Nunes memo said.

Mr. Ohr was demoted at Justice late last year.

Rather than getting a platform to speak to the nation in a daylong TV performance , Strzok should be summarily dismissed from the FBI , thoroughly investigated and prosecuted if the evidence shows he has broken the law .
Mueller removed Strzok from the Russia investigation last year after learning of numerous rabidly anti-Trump and pro-Clinton text messages that Strzok traded with his then-lover Lisa Page , who was an FBI lawyer at the time .
The texts made it crystal clear that Strzok and Page despised Donald Trump and wanted Hillary Clinton to defeat him in the 2016 presidential election .
In one text exchange , Page wrote to Strzok about Trump : “ He ’ s not ever going to become president , right ? Right ? ! ” Strzok replied : “ No . No he won ’ t . We ’ ll stop it . ”
Strzok also said in a text that there was an unspecified “ insurance policy ” that would keep Trump out of the White House .

Strzok did his best to fuse himself to the good and dedicated men and women of the finest law enforcement agency in the world , but the truth is that his shabby conduct has done more to damage the FBI than any one person in its storied history .
Scores of current and retired FBI employees who gave their all to the organization have expressed to me that they deeply resent being unfairly forced to deal with the consequences of Strzok ’ s bad behavior .
For all the drama , fire and fury , the House hearing shed no new light on Strzok ’ s conduct at the FBI . It did , however , demonstrate the general uselessness of Congressional hearings .

The sad truth is that in the Republicans ’ zeal to administer a public flogging of Strzok – and by extension the FBI – the GOP House members walked right into a trap .
The hearing never had a chance of uncovering the truth . This is so because Strzok enjoyed the advantage of being able to shower the committees with self-serving protestations while hiding behind the restrictions on his testimony imposed by the FBI attorney hovering behind him .

The Horowitz report described how Strzok , as the head of the Clinton email investigation , sat on his hands for well over three weeks after the New York FBI office reported to him that it had discovered new evidence relevant to the Clinton investigation .

Mr. Clevenger says that by deleting emails that the government later determined were official records and should have been returned to the State Department — and that were subject to preservation requests — the lawyers engaged in destruction of evidence.

“ There is a very significant number of people that are on suspicious watch lists , under surveillance , '' Republican Sen. Dan Coats said .
Coats , who sits on the Select Committee on Intelligence , would not comment on specifics , but said the around-the-clock surveillance is a major commitment for the bureau . `` The FBI together with law enforcement agencies across the country are engaged in this . It takes enormous amount of manpower to do this on a 24-7 basis . It takes enormous amount of money to do this , '' Coats explained .
These elite FBI teams are reserved for espionage , mob violence and high-priority terrorism cases , like a joint terrorism task force case last June , where a 26 year old suspect Usaama Rahim , was killed outside a Massachusetts CVS . When a police officer and FBI agent tried to question him , the Boston Police Commissioner said Rahim threatened them with a knife , and was shot dead .
With at least a dozen agents assigned to each case , providing 24/7 coverage , this high level of surveillance reflects the severe risk associated with suspects most likely to attempt copycat attacks after Paris .
`` It is a big resource drain . Yes it is . Almost overwhelming , '' Coats said when asked about the demand placed on the FBI . `` There will be a lot of people over the Thanksgiving weekend that will not be enjoying turkey with their family . They 'll be out there providing security for the American people and the threat is particularly high during this holiday period . ''
One of the lessons of Paris is that the radicalization process can be swift . According to published reports , friends of the female suspect who was killed in the siege of Saint Denis , Hasna Ait Boulahcen , abandoned her party life only a month before joining her cousin , Abdelhamid Abaaoud , the plot 's on the ground commander . He was also killed in the siege .
FBI Director James Comey has consistently drawn attention to this phenomenon , calling it the `` flash to bang , '' that the time between radicalization and crossing the threshold to violent action can be very short . Last week , in a rare public appearance with Attorney General Loretta Lynch , Comey would only say that `` dozens '' of suspected radicals have been under `` tight surveillance . ''
`` Together we are watching people of concern using all of our lawful tools . We will keep watching them and if we see something we will work to disrupt it , '' Comey said .

Russia hearing live: FBI director Comey says no information to confirm Trump's wiretap claims Read more

James Comey’s appearance in the House of Representatives, alongside intelligence chiefs past and present, will be a climactic moment in the investigation of Russia’s role in last year’s US presidential election, which has dogged the early weeks of the Trump administration. But it is unclear how many of the key unanswered questions will be resolved.

One of the first questions Comey is likely to be asked is whether Trump or his campaign was subject to a wiretap, as the president has repeatedly claimed over the past fortnight, without providing evidence.

That was a claim made by a Fox News commentator, which had been read out at a White House briefing by spokesman, Sean Spicer.

“I hope that we can put an end to this wild goose chase, because what the president said was just patently false,” Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, told the NBC’s Meet the Press. “It’s continuing to grow in terms of damage, and he needs to put an end to this.”

In a series of early-morning tweets on Monday, Trump claimed that the idea that he “colluded with Russia” was “FAKE NEWS and everyone knows it” and said that the former director of national intelligence James Clapper had said there was no evidence of such collusion.

In a tweet on Sunday , the president said he will officially call for an investigation to determine the extent of the FBI ’ s infiltration into his campaign and where the order originated .
“ I hereby demand , and will do so officially tomorrow , that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes — and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration ! ” the president tweeted .
The demand was made days after media reports identified Cambridge professor Stefan Halper , 73 , as the FBI informant who met with several members of the Trump campaign in the summer of 2016 .
A foreign policy analyst and veteran of several Republican administrations , Mr. Halper reportedly requested a meeting in London with Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos , which Mr. Papadopoulos accepted . In the early October meeting , Mr. Halper reportedly asked , “ George , you know about hacking the emails from Russia , right ? ”
Mr. Trump equated the tactic with spying and said it could go down as the “ all time biggest political scandal ! ”

Mr. Papadopoulos would become the subject of special counsel Robert Mueller ’ s investigation into Russian meddling in the presidential race . The Trump campaign ’ s former foreign policy adviser pleaded guilty in October to making false statements to the FBI .
In a statement Sunday night , Sarah Isgur Flores , director of public affairs at the Justice Department , said the department ’ s watchdog has been asked to look into the accusations of improper surveillance .
“ The Department has asked the Inspector General to expand the ongoing review of the FISA application process to include determining whether there was any impropriety or political motivation in how the FBI conducted its counterintelligence investigation of persons suspected of involvement with the Russian agents who interfered in the 2016 presidential election , ” Ms. Flores said . “ As always , the Inspector General will consult with the appropriate U.S. Attorney if there is any evidence of potential criminal conduct . ”
Rep. Mark Meadows , North Carolina Republican and chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus , said Mr. Trump is making the right call .
But he also said the Justice Department can ’ t be impartial about policing itself . He pointed to the department ’ s refusal to turn over to the House documents outlining the scope of Mr. Mueller ’ s investigation .
“ We ’ ve seen disturbing evidence that the FBI engaged in political targeting , ” Mr. Meadows tweeted . “ But the DOJ can ’ t be trusted to investigate themselves — Congress needs the documents too . [ Deputy Attorney General ] Rod Rosenstein : where are the documents ? Show Americans the truth . ”
Former CIA Director John Brennan , a harsh critic of Mr. Trump , had a different idea about what Congress should do , lashing out at the president Sunday on Twitter and calling on congressional Republican leaders to stop him .
“ Senator [ Mitch ] McConnell & Speaker [ Paul ] Ryan : If Mr. Trump continues along this disastrous path , you will bear major responsibility for the harm done to our democracy , ” Mr. Brennan tweeted . “ You do a great disservice to our Nation & the Republican Party if you continue to enable Mr. Trump ’ s self-serving actions . ”
Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California , the ranking Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , said the idea that the FBI spied on the Trump campaign is nonsense .
“ The most I can tell you , Chuck , is that this claim by the president , the suggestion by [ Rudolph W. ] Giuliani that there is a political spy embedded in the Trump campaign , is nonsense , ” Mr. Schiff told Chuck Todd on NBC ’ s “ Meet the Press. ” “ And you hear it in the same terms that Trump often speaks , which is ‘ people are saying , ’ or ‘ I ’ m hearing , ’ or ‘ We ’ re being told. ’ That ’ s another way of saying , ‘ This is patently untrue , but we would like to spread it anyway. ’ And it ’ s singularly destructive of our institutions , but then that ’ s the point . ”
If reports of the informant are true , Rep. Devin Nunes , California Republican and chairman of the House intelligence committee , said it ’ s a “ red line ” that the FBI should not be allowed to cross .
“ If they paid someone , it ’ s an absolute red line , and this is over with , ” he said . “ I mean , there is no possible way that we should be allowing , even if it was legal , we should never allow this in this country . Congress should not allow for anything like this to ever occur again to any political campaign , if it in fact happened . ”
Mr. Nunes , who has accused the Justice Department of stonewalling congressional document requests , said it ’ s impossible to tell how many informants were working to infiltrate the Trump campaign .
“ We don ’ t know if there ’ s one informant or more informants because there ’ s so much out there now , ” he said . “ It ’ s really getting tough to follow , and all we ’ re asking for is give us the documentation that you used to start this investigation . ”
Mr. Nunes also questioned the timing of the media reports about the FBI ’ s informant , effectively accusing at least some people within the Justice Department of trying to set him up .
He said the Justice Department had invited him and Rep. Trey Gowdy , South Carolina Republican , to a meeting Friday , which the lawmakers declined to attend after information from a previous meeting was leaked to the press .
“ They were trying to get Mr. Gowdy and I to go on Friday to the Department of Justice for supposedly another briefing , ” Mr. Nunes said . “ We said , ‘ Look , unless we ’ re going to get documents. ’ We found out Thursday night they were not going to provide documents , so therefore we ’ re not going to go . Now , if you look what happened on Friday night , probably the mother of all leaks of all time to two major newspapers that came out late Friday night . Now had Mr. Gowdy and I went to that meeting , you can bet they would have tried to pin that on us . ”
The accusations of spying have emerged as patience with Mr. Mueller ’ s investigation grows thin . The president ’ s allies point out that no evidence of collusion with a foreign adversary has been made public .
Roger Stone , a longtime Trump aide , said it ’ s “ not inconceivable ” that Mr. Mueller will try to “ conjure up ” a crime completely unrelated to the 2016 campaign .

The text message , which was sent by Peter Strzok , is “ jaw-dropping , ” Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson , the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee , said in a radio interview on Tuesday .
In an interview with WISN-Milwaukee radio host Jay Weber , Johnson read aloud a May 19 , 2017 text that Strzok sent to Lisa Page , an FBI lawyer and his mistress .
Strzok wrote : “ You and I both know the odds are nothing . If I thought it was likely , I ’ d be there no question . I hesitate in part because of my gut sense and concern that there ’ s no big there there . ”
Johnson said that the text referred to the Mueller investigation , which had kicked off two days earlier . Strzok joined that team , but was removed in July after the Justice Department ’ s inspector general discovered his anti-Trump text exchanges with Page .
As the FBI ’ s deputy counterintelligence chief , Strzok was picked in July 2016 to oversee the investigation into possible Trump campaign collusion with the Russian government . Prior to that , he was a top investigator on the Clinton email inquiry .
“ I think that ’ s kind of jaw-dropping , ” said Johnson , a Republican , said of the Strzok text .
“ In other words , Peter Strzok , who was the FBI deputy assistant director of the counterintelligence division , the man who had a plan to do something because he just couldn ’ t abide Donald Trump being president , is saying that his gut sense is that there ’ s no big there there when it comes to the Mueller special counsel investigation , ” he said .
The text message was included in 400 pages of text messages exchanged between Strzok and Page . Lawmakers have started reviewing the trove of documents for evidence of anti-Trump and pro-Clinton bias .
Johnson also addressed the revelation last Friday that the FBI “ failed to preserve ” five months worth of text messages exchanged between Strzok and Page . A Justice Department official told Johnson ’ s committee and five other congressional panels that a “ misconfiguration ” issue caused “ many ” FBI-issued mobile devices to not back up to the bureau ’ s servers .

Strzok Page Text Messages 5-19-17 by Chuck Ross on Scribd","The FBI’s top agent on the Trump-Russia investigation sent a text message last year that one top Republican senator says suggests he saw no evidence of Trump campaign collusion.

The text message, which was sent by Peter Strzok, is “jaw-dropping,” Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said in a radio interview on Tuesday.

In an interview with WISN-Milwaukee radio host Jay Weber, Johnson read aloud a May 19, 2017 text that Strzok sent to Lisa Page, an FBI lawyer and his mistress.

Strzok wrote: “You and I both know the odds are nothing. If I thought it was likely, I’d be there no question. I hesitate in part because of my gut sense and concern that there’s no big there there.”

Johnson said that the text referred to the Mueller investigation, which had kicked off two days earlier. Strzok joined that team, but was removed in July after the Justice Department’s inspector general discovered his anti-Trump text exchanges with Page.

As the FBI’s deputy counterintelligence chief, Strzok was picked in July 2016 to oversee the investigation into possible Trump campaign collusion with the Russian government. Prior to that, he was a top investigator on the Clinton email inquiry.

“I think that’s kind of jaw-dropping,” said Johnson, a Republican, said of the Strzok text.

“In other words, Peter Strzok, who was the FBI deputy assistant director of the counterintelligence division, the man who had a plan to do something because he just couldn’t abide Donald Trump being president, is saying that his gut sense is that there’s no big there there when it comes to the Mueller special counsel investigation,” he said.

The text message was included in 400 pages of text messages exchanged between Strzok and Page. Lawmakers have started reviewing the trove of documents for evidence of anti-Trump and pro-Clinton bias.

Johnson also addressed the revelation last Friday that the FBI “failed to preserve” five months worth of text messages exchanged between Strzok and Page. A Justice Department official told Johnson’s committee and five other congressional panels that a “misconfiguration” issue caused “many” FBI-issued mobile devices to not back up to the bureau’s servers.

The FBI said it does not have text messages for Strzok and Page for the period between Dec. 14, 2016 and May 17, 2017 — the day that Mueller was appointed.

Johnson said that Congress needs to see the missing text messages because Strzok and Page were “completely unguarded in their communication.”

“So we’re getting insight into exactly what is happening inside the FBI at the highest levels. And who knows who else they might implicate in terms of corruption,” he said.

Johnson released two pages of Strzok-Page messages from May 19, 2017. They show the pair seemingly discussing the new Mueller investigation and whether they wanted to join.

The messages show that Strzok and Page discussed the historical significance of the investigation and its potential impact on their career trajectory.

“A case which will be in the history books,” Strzok wrote to Page in one text, adding that it was “maybe the most important case of our lives.”

Strzok then appeared to try to coax Page into joining the Mueller investigation.

“You would obviously excel on the team,” he said.

She responded by saying that she didn’t “understand what they need me for!”

In another text, Strzok referred to his work on the Clinton investigation.

“For me, and this case, I personally have a sense of unfinished business,” he said. “I unleashed it with MYE. Now I need to fix it and finish it.”

“MYE” refers to “Mid-Year Exam,” the FBI’s code name for the Clinton investigation.

“You shouldn’t take this on,” Page then wrote. “I promise you, I would tell you if you should.”

After several exchanges discussing their positions at FBI, Strzok suggested to Page that he did not want to take on the Mueller job because of his “gut sense and concern there’s no big there there.”

What are the details?

The documents, released via the FBI's ""The Vault,"" include notes from an independent review that reveal the Romanian hacker known as ""Guccifer"" potentially compromised Clinton's unprotected email server when he breached a separate server operated by longtime Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal.

""It is inescapable that a security breach and a violation of basic server security occurred here, both with Mr. Blumenthal and Mrs. Clinton,"" the notes state.

Shockingly, the notes confirm Guccifer used a server in Russia to conduct his hacking ""penetration,"" leaving the U.S. intelligence community to conclude there is a ""high possibility"" Russian officials retained a copy of the hacked information and data.

Of most concern, an Excel spreadsheet with ""targeting data"" from Clinton's server was discovered on the Dark Web, a highly encrypted layer of the internet used by criminals and hackers. The notes call the document's presence on the dark web a ""major loss to the Intelligence Community.""

To make matters worse, the document in question was found stripped of its classification ""collars,"" which should have been the government's highest level of classification: Top Secret.

FBI,2015-06-02,"Jack Gillum, Eileen Sullivan, Eric Tucker","The FBI is operating a small air force with scores of low-flying planes across the country carrying video and , at times , cellphone surveillance technology — all hidden behind fictitious companies that are fronts for the government , The Associated Press has learned .
The planes ' surveillance equipment is generally used without a judge 's approval , and the FBI said the flights are used for specific , ongoing investigations . In a recent 30-day period , the agency flew above more than 30 cities in 11 states across the country , an AP review found .
Aerial surveillance represents a changing frontier for law enforcement , providing what the government maintains is an important tool in criminal , terrorism or intelligence probes . But the program raises questions about whether there should be updated policies protecting civil liberties as new technologies pose intrusive opportunities for government spying .
U.S. law enforcement officials confirmed for the first time the wide-scale use of the aircraft , which the AP traced to at least 13 fake companies , such as FVX Research , KQM Aviation , NBR Aviation and PXW Services . Even basic aspects of the program are withheld from the public in censored versions of official reports from the Justice Department 's inspector general .
`` The FBI 's aviation program is not secret , '' spokesman Christopher Allen said in a statement . `` Specific aircraft and their capabilities are protected for operational security purposes . '' Allen added that the FBI 's planes `` are not equipped , designed or used for bulk collection activities or mass surveillance . ''
But the planes can capture video of unrelated criminal activity on the ground that could be handed over for prosecutions .
Some of the aircraft can also be equipped with technology that can identify thousands of people below through the cellphones they carry , even if they 're not making a call or in public . Officials said that practice , which mimics cell towers and gets phones to reveal basic subscriber information , is rare .
Details confirmed by the FBI track closely with published reports since at least 2003 that a government surveillance program might be behind suspicious-looking planes slowly circling neighborhoods . The AP traced at least 50 aircraft back to the FBI , and identified more than 100 flights since late April orbiting both major cities and rural areas .
One of the planes , photographed in flight last week by the AP in northern Virginia , bristled with unusual antennas under its fuselage and a camera on its left side . A federal budget document from 2010 mentioned at least 115 planes , including 90 Cessna aircraft , in the FBI 's surveillance fleet .
The FBI also occasionally helps local police with aerial support , such as during the recent disturbance in Baltimore that followed the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray , who sustained grievous injuries while in police custody . Those types of requests are reviewed by senior FBI officials .
The surveillance flights comply with agency rules , an FBI spokesman said . Those rules , which are heavily redacted in publicly available documents , limit the types of equipment the agency can use , as well as the justifications and duration of the surveillance .
Details about the flights come as the Justice Department seeks to navigate privacy concerns arising from aerial surveillance by unmanned aircrafts , or drones . President Barack Obama has said he welcomes a debate on government surveillance , and has called for more transparency about spying in the wake of disclosures about classified programs .
`` These are not your grandparents ' surveillance aircraft , '' said Jay Stanley , a senior policy analyst with the American Civil Liberties Union , calling the flights significant `` if the federal government is maintaining a fleet of aircraft whose purpose is to circle over American cities , especially with the technology we know can be attached to those aircraft . ''
During the past few weeks , the AP tracked planes from the FBI 's fleet on more than 100 flights over at least 11 states plus the District of Columbia , most with Cessna 182T Skylane aircraft . These included parts of Houston , Phoenix , Seattle , Chicago , Boston , Minneapolis and Southern California .
Evolving technology can record higher-quality video from long distances , even at night , and can capture certain identifying information from cellphones using a device known as a `` cell-site simulator '' — or Stingray , to use one of the product 's brand names . These can trick pinpointed cellphones into revealing identification numbers of subscribers , including those not suspected of a crime .
Officials say cellphone surveillance is rare , although the AP found in recent weeks FBI flights orbiting large , enclosed buildings for extended periods where aerial photography would be less effective than electronic signals collection . Those included above Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and the Mall of America in Bloomington , Minnesota .
After The Washington Post revealed flights by two planes circling over Baltimore in early May , the AP began analyzing detailed flight data and aircraft-ownership registrations that shared similar addresses and flight patterns . That review found some FBI missions circled above at least 40,000 residents during a single flight over Anaheim , California , in late May , according to Census data and records provided by the website FlightRadar24.com .
Most flight patterns occurred in counter-clockwise orbits up to several miles wide and roughly one mile above the ground at slow speeds . A 2003 newsletter from the company FLIR Systems Inc. , which makes camera technology such as seen on the planes , described flying slowly in left-handed patterns .
`` Aircraft surveillance has become an indispensable intelligence collection and investigative technique which serves as a force multiplier to the ground teams , '' the FBI said in 2009 when it asked Congress for $ 5.1 million for the program .
Recently , independent journalists and websites have cited companies traced to post office boxes in Virginia , including one shared with the Justice Department . The AP analyzed similar data since early May , while also drawing upon aircraft registration documents , business records and interviews with U.S. officials to understand the scope of the operations .
The FBI asked the AP not to disclose the names of the fake companies it uncovered , saying that would saddle taxpayers with the expense of creating new cover companies to shield the government 's involvement , and could endanger the planes and integrity of the surveillance missions . The AP declined the FBI 's request because the companies ' names — as well as common addresses linked to the Justice Department — are listed on public documents and in government databases .
At least 13 front companies that AP identified being actively used by the FBI are registered to post office boxes in Bristow , Virginia , which is near a regional airport used for private and charter flights . Only one of them appears in state business records .
Included on most aircraft registrations is a mysterious name , Robert Lindley . He is listed as chief executive and has at least three distinct signatures among the companies . Two documents include a signature for Robert Taylor , which is strikingly similar to one of Lindley 's three handwriting patterns .
The FBI would not say whether Lindley is a U.S. government employee . The AP unsuccessfully tried to reach Lindley at phone numbers registered to people of the same name in the Washington area since Monday .
Law enforcement officials said Justice Department lawyers approved the decision to create fictitious companies to protect the flights ' operational security and that the Federal Aviation Administration was aware of the practice . One of the Lindley-headed companies shares a post office box openly used by the Justice Department .
Such elusive practices have endured for decades . A 1990 report by the then-General Accounting Office noted that , in July 1988 , the FBI had moved its `` headquarters-operated '' aircraft into a company that was n't publicly linked to the bureau .
The FBI does not generally obtain warrants to record video from its planes of people moving outside in the open , but it also said that under a new policy it has recently begun obtaining court orders to use cell-site simulators . The Obama administration had until recently been directing local authorities through secret agreements not to reveal their own use of the devices , even encouraging prosecutors to drop cases rather than disclose the technology 's use in open court .
A Justice Department memo last month also expressly barred its component law enforcement agencies from using unmanned drones `` solely for the purpose of monitoring activities protected by the First Amendment '' and said they are to be used only in connection with authorized investigations and activities . A department spokeswoman said the policy applied only to unmanned aircraft systems rather than piloted airplanes .

President Trump says he has chosen Christopher Wray, a former Justice Department official during President George W. Bush's administration, to head the FBI. Wray now works on white collar crime at an international law firm.

The president named his pick via Twitter, writing Wednesday morning, ""I will be nominating Christopher A. Wray, a man of impeccable credentials, to be the new Director of the FBI. Details to follow.""

The announcement comes one day before ousted FBI Director James Comey is scheduled to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee, which has been investigating Russia's meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. Trump fired Comey in May and has been interviewing candidates to succeed him.

Among Wray's credentials is a stint as the assistant attorney general leading the Justice Department's criminal division, from 2003 to 2005. In that post, he worked under attorneys general John Ashcroft and Alberto Gonzales — as well as under Comey, who was then the deputy attorney general.

Wray has been in private practice since then, working on white-collar crime and regulatory cases as a partner in the Washington, D.C., and Atlanta offices of the King & Spalding.

He has recently been involved in representing New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in the ""Bridgegate"" case over politically motivated lane closures on the George Washington Bridge.

The Asbury Park Press reports that Christie and Wray previously worked together during the Bush administration, when Christie was a U.S. attorney and Wray was a deputy attorney general.

Concentrated in the bureau 's DC field office and supported by field offices across the nation , these agents routinely carry out the gumshoe probes that help elevate public servants into positions of power .
`` You 're basically knocking on doors and doing neighborhood canvasses and looking at the suitability and fitness for office of future FBI agents , of people who are undergoing a five-year re-investigation to maintain a top secret clearance , and for judicial nominees , like Kavanaugh , '' said retired FBI Supervisory Special Agent James Gagliano , a CNN law enforcement analyst .
On Friday , Trump directed the law enforcement agency to re-open the background investigation of his nominee after Sen. Jeff Flake , an Arizona Republican , sided with Democrats who had asked the FBI to look into allegations that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when the two were teenagers in Maryland .
The investigation will also look into an allegation made by Deborah Ramirez , who accused Kavanaugh of exposing himself to her at a party when they were students at Yale University . Kavanaugh and the White House have denied the allegation .
The FBI has reached out to Ramirez and she has agreed to cooperate , her attorney told CNN in a statement .
`` We can confirm the FBI has reached out to interview Ms. Ramirez and she has agreed to cooperate with their investigation . Out of respect for the integrity of the process , we will have no further comment at this time , '' John Clune said .
`` I 've ordered the FBI to conduct a supplemental investigation to update Judge Kavanaugh 's file . As the Senate has requested , this update must be limited in scope and completed in less than one week , '' Trump said in a statement .
The FBI has not commented on the President 's order , but a background investigation for a presidential appointee , like Kavanaugh , would also likely have a layer of oversight from the highest levels of the FBI 's headquarters in Washington , and senior agents could be brought in to bolster the background investigation squad for the most sensitive interviews , former agents said .
Given the unprecedented situation , the FBI could also employ novel tools , or create a `` special '' investigative team that exists across agency divisions , the former officials said .
While background checks typically take days of on-the-ground investigation , in a case this closely scrutinized , FBI leaders could decide to go full bore , assigning a slew of agents from multiple squads to wrap the probe in short time .
`` They could just about drop everything else they 're doing , every other background check for generals to get the next star , and cabinet secretaries and US attorneys , '' said Tom Fuentes , a former FBI assistant director and senior CNN law enforcement analyst . `` They could wrap everything . If they want to put 500 agents on this tomorrow they could do that . ''
The scope of the investigation that FBI agents will undertake now is unclear . Ford divulged the details of her charge in a nationally televised hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday , and two more women have come forward publicly claiming episodes of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh . He has forcefully and categorically denied them .
Key to Ford 's charge , which dates back to a party in 1982 , are a handful of witnesses that the California psychologist says were present on the night of the alleged attack .
Mark Judge , who Ford says was in the room with Kavanaugh when he pinned her to a bed and covered her mouth while trying to remove her clothes , has also denied the incident took place . In a statement through his lawyer Friday , Judge said he would `` answer any and all questions posed to him '' if the FBI requested an interview . Two other people who Ford says were present the night of the incident -- Patrick J. Smyth and Leland Ingham Keyser -- have said they do not remember being at a party with Ford and Kavanaugh .
A lawyer for Smyth also said Friday that he is `` happy to cooperate fully with this FBI investigation , '' and Keyser 's attorney said in a letter to the committee that his client would also cooperate with the investigation .
FBI officials will likely try to question some or all of the potential witnesses , in addition to Ford and Kavanaugh . The FBI , however , can not force interviews in background check investigations , or in criminal investigations for that matter . While witnesses in a criminal case can be subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury , witnesses to a background investigation do n't face a similar law enforcement tool to get them to talk .
In addition to the people said to be at the party , investigators may seek out witnesses who can attest to the credibility of Ford , including her parents , the former agents said . Evidence of any substance abuse problems could color a claimant 's accusation , but the FBI notably does not make any conclusions about the credibility or significance of an allegation in a background investigation report .
`` They could interview someone who says I saw Judge Kavanaugh get beamed down from a UFO -- he 's an alien . They would put that in the 302 , '' said Chris Swecker , a former FBI assistant director , referring to the form in which agents will memorialize their interviews . `` They would n't say 'we disproved this , they did n't disprove this . ' ''
A supplemental background check into Ford 's allegations could also widen beyond witness interviews to include an investigation into a gap that Ford has admitted to in her story : the date of the party .
In her Senate appearance Thursday , Ford lamented her foggy memory but offered up a clue -- an encounter with Judge at a supermarket he worked at an estimated six to eight weeks after the alleged attack .
`` It would be helpful with anyone 's resources if — to figure out when he worked there , if people are wanting more details from me about when the attack occurred , '' Ford said .
Safeway , the chain that Ford testified seeing Judge arranging shopping carts at , did not respond to CNN 's request for employment records . The FBI may have better luck .
Still , with 36 years between the night of the alleged attack and the forthcoming background investigation , the agents in this background check have their work cut out for them .
`` You 're going to be dealing on fading memories , you 're going to be dealing on neighborhood canvasses where the accuser is not sure where that neighborhood was . It 's going to be an uphill , daunting task , '' Gagliano said .","Washington (CNN) Now that President Donald Trump has ordered the FBI to conduct a supplemental background investigation into Brett Kavanaugh, the job of getting to the bottom of the explosive allegation of sexual assault that is holding up the Supreme Court nominee's confirmation may fall into the hands of the bureau's Washington-based team responsible for conducting background investigations for high-profile appointees.

""I've ordered the FBI to conduct a supplemental investigation to update Judge Kavanaugh's file. As the Senate has requested, this update must be limited in scope and completed in less than one week,"" Trump said in a statement.

The FBI has not commented on the President's order, but a background investigation for a presidential appointee, like Kavanaugh, would also likely have a layer of oversight from the highest levels of the FBI's headquarters in Washington, and senior agents could be brought in to bolster the background investigation squad for the most sensitive interviews, former agents said.

Given the unprecedented situation, the FBI could also employ novel tools, or create a ""special"" investigative team that exists across agency divisions, the former officials said.

While background checks typically take days of on-the-ground investigation, in a case this closely scrutinized, FBI leaders could decide to go full bore, assigning a slew of agents from multiple squads to wrap the probe in short time.

""They could just about drop everything else they're doing, every other background check for generals to get the next star, and cabinet secretaries and US attorneys,"" said Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director and senior CNN law enforcement analyst. ""They could wrap everything. If they want to put 500 agents on this tomorrow they could do that.""

The scope of the investigation that FBI agents will undertake now is unclear. Ford divulged the details of her charge in a nationally televised hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday, and two more women have come forward publicly claiming episodes of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh. He has forcefully and categorically denied them.

Key to Ford's charge, which dates back to a party in 1982, are a handful of witnesses that the California psychologist says were present on the night of the alleged attack.

Mark Judge, who Ford says was in the room with Kavanaugh when he pinned her to a bed and covered her mouth while trying to remove her clothes, has also denied the incident took place. In a statement through his lawyer Friday, Judge said he would ""answer any and all questions posed to him"" if the FBI requested an interview. Two other people who Ford says were present the night of the incident -- Patrick J. Smyth and Leland Ingham Keyser -- have said they do not remember being at a party with Ford and Kavanaugh.

A lawyer for Smyth also said Friday that he is ""happy to cooperate fully with this FBI investigation,"" and Keyser's attorney said in a letter to the committee that his client would also cooperate with the investigation.

FBI officials will likely try to question some or all of the potential witnesses, in addition to Ford and Kavanaugh. The FBI, however, cannot force interviews in background check investigations, or in criminal investigations for that matter. While witnesses in a criminal case can be subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury, witnesses to a background investigation don't face a similar law enforcement tool to get them to talk.

In addition to the people said to be at the party, investigators may seek out witnesses who can attest to the credibility of Ford, including her parents, the former agents said. Evidence of any substance abuse problems could color a claimant's accusation, but the FBI notably does not make any conclusions about the credibility or significance of an allegation in a background investigation report.

""They could interview someone who says I saw Judge Kavanaugh get beamed down from a UFO -- he's an alien. They would put that in the 302,"" said Chris Swecker, a former FBI assistant director, referring to the form in which agents will memorialize their interviews. ""They wouldn't say 'we disproved this, they didn't disprove this.'""

A supplemental background check into Ford's allegations could also widen beyond witness interviews to include an investigation into a gap that Ford has admitted to in her story: the date of the party.

In her Senate appearance Thursday, Ford lamented her foggy memory but offered up a clue -- an encounter with Judge at a supermarket he worked at an estimated six to eight weeks after the alleged attack.

""It would be helpful with anyone's resources if — to figure out when he worked there, if people are wanting more details from me about when the attack occurred,"" Ford said.

Safeway, the chain that Ford testified seeing Judge arranging shopping carts at, did not respond to CNN's request for employment records. The FBI may have better luck.

Still, with 36 years between the night of the alleged attack and the forthcoming background investigation, the agents in this background check have their work cut out for them.

""You're going to be dealing on fading memories, you're going to be dealing on neighborhood canvasses where the accuser is not sure where that neighborhood was. It's going to be an uphill, daunting task,"" Gagliano said.",www.cnn.com,left,EPEubIkf1mAVcZAH

FBI Director James Comey , who testified in front of two congressional committees this week , still maintains that he was unable to recommend that the DOJ charge Clinton with mishandling classified documents because of insufficient evidence proving `` intent '' —although the actions themselves are irrefutably illegal .
Well , how exactly did he anticipate gathering this proof , when the DOJ had proactively shielded the five people tasked with setting up the private system and then destroying it ? Was he hoping to extract a confession directly from Clinton ?
Why would , for instance , a Clinton functionary like Cheryl Mills help prosecutors once she 'd already secured safeguards against any criminal prosecution ? While testifying in front of the House Judiciary Committee , Comey claimed that Mills was already `` cooperative '' and that the Justice Department had assured the FBI she had done nothing wrong .
If she were accommodating and completely innocent , why would she seek—and be given—immunity ? A lawyer for Mills and Heather Samuelson , another one of the five , had already admitted the deal was struck to protect her clients from potential prosecution arising from `` classification '' on their laptops .

FBI Director James Comey, who testified in front of two congressional committees this week, still maintains that he was unable to recommend that the DOJ charge Clinton with mishandling classified documents because of insufficient evidence proving ""intent""—although the actions themselves are irrefutably illegal.

Well, how exactly did he anticipate gathering this proof, when the DOJ had proactively shielded the five people tasked with setting up the private system and then destroying it? Was he hoping to extract a confession directly from Clinton?

Why would, for instance, a Clinton functionary like Cheryl Mills help prosecutors once she'd already secured safeguards against any criminal prosecution? While testifying in front of the House Judiciary Committee, Comey claimed that Mills was already ""cooperative"" and that the Justice Department had assured the FBI she had done nothing wrong.

If she were accommodating and completely innocent, why would she seek—and be given—immunity? A lawyer for Mills and Heather Samuelson, another one of the five, had already admitted the deal was struck to protect her clients from potential prosecution arising from ""classification"" on their laptops. Apparently, the DOJ was more convinced of their innocence than their lawyer was.

In the FBI's summary statement, Mills alleged that she didn't know about Clinton's email server until after the secretary of state's tenure was over. Emails since uncovered, however, show this to be untrue. Remember also that, President Obama claimed that he first learned about Clinton's illegal server through ""news reports."" If that's true, why did he email Clinton on her private server under a pseudonym?

Comey admitted Wednesday that one of Clinton's lawyers—""it might have been Cheryl Mills""—told Paul Combetta, Clinton's IT specialist, to delete email files from Clinton's secret server only days after Congress ordered them to be preserved. And Comey assures us that none of this is obstruction of justice.

Then, at another point, he told the committee that the DOJ agreed to give immunity because the FBI didn't feel like wrangling with lawyers for years. ""The FBI judgment was we need to get to that laptop. We need to see what it is,"" he explained. ""This investigation's been going on for a year.""

So I guess Mills was less than cooperative. Yes?

And why is Comey, who doesn't ""give a hoot about politics,"" concerned about timetables, rather than making the best case? If the laptop was important enough to hasten a deal that protected a potential witness from prosecution, why wasn't it important enough for the FBI to subpoena? If Mills' lawyer is worried about potential criminality, why take a plea bargain off the table? Is this how it works for everyone?

It was rather amazing to hear Comey concede that the DOJ's immunity spree was ""unusual."" More unusual, perhaps, was that three of the people with those deals still ended up taking the Fifth, and another didn't even bother showing up when Congress called him. It's also unusual that a high-profile case featuring numerous immunity deals resulted in no charges.

To Comey, it was also ""very unusual"" that the FBI would conduct an interview with the target of an investigation—where wholly innocent Clinton was surrounded by nine lawyers—with two of the immunized witnesses in the case present. That's something Comey admitted had never happened in his career.

“Equal justice under the law” is not supposed to be an aspiration or a quaint slogan. It is supposed to be a guarantee.

The date of a meeting, that’s all the lie was about.

George Papadopoulos claimed that a meeting he’d had with the mysterious Maltese professor, Josef Mifsud, happened slightly before the green-as-grass 28-year-old was recruited into the Trump campaign. In reality, it was slightly after.

Napolitano","The FBI investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ’ s failure to protect state secrets contained in her emails has entered its penultimate phase , and it is a dangerous one for her and her aides .
Federal law enforcement sources have let it be known that federal prosecutors and the FBI have completed their examination of raw data in the case . After the FBI acquires raw data -- for example , the nature and number of the state secrets in the emails Clinton failed to protect or the regular , consistent , systematic nature of that failure -- prosecutors and agents proceed to draw rational inferences from that data .
Then they proceed to corroborate those inferences , looking for other sources to support or even to contradict them . With one exception , all of this work has been done with neutral sources of evidence -- documents , email metadata , government records and technical experts .
The exception is Bryan Pagliano , the one member of Clinton 's inner circle who , with either a written promise of non-prosecution or an order of immunity from a federal judge , began to cooperate with federal prosecutors last fall .
Pagliano has explained to federal prosecutors the who , what , when , how and why he migrated an open State Department email stream and a secret State Department email stream from government computers to Clinton 's secret server in her home in Chappaqua , New York . He has told them that Clinton paid him $ 5,000 to commit that likely criminal activity .
He has also told some of the 147 FBI agents assigned to this case that Clinton herself was repeatedly told by her own State Department information technology experts and their colleagues at the National Security Agency that her persistent use of her off-the-shelf BlackBerry was neither an effective nor an acceptable means of receiving , transmitting or safeguarding state secrets . Little did they know how reckless she was with government secrets , as none was apparently then aware of her use of her non-secure secret server in Chappaqua for all of her email uses .
We know that the acquisition and corroboration phase of the investigation has been completed because the prosecutors have begun to ask Clinton 's top aides during her time as secretary of state to come in for interviews . This is a delicate and dangerous phase for the aides , all of whom have engaged counsel to represent them .
The Department of Justice will not reveal to the aides or their lawyers what it knows about the case or what evidence of criminal wrongdoing , if any , it has acquired on each of them . Hence , if they submit to an FBI interview , they will go in `` blind . '' By going in blind , the aides run the risk of getting caught in a `` perjury trap .

For this reason , most white-collar criminal defense lawyers will not permit their clients to be interviewed by any prosecutors or FBI agents . Martha Stewart 's lawyers failed to give her that advice , and she went to prison for one lie told in one conversation with one FBI agent .
After interviewing any Clinton aides who choose to be interviewed , the DOJ personnel on the case will move their investigation into its final phase , in which they will ask Clinton herself whether she wishes to speak with them . The prosecutors will basically tell her lawyers that they have evidence of the criminal behavior of their client and that before they present it to a grand jury , they want to afford Clinton an opportunity blindly to challenge it .

fbi,Guest Writer - Right,2,http://nypost.com/2016/10/06/fbi-agents-are-ready-to-revolt-over-the-cozy-clinton-probe/,FBI agents are ready to revolt over the cozy Clinton probe,2016-10-06,Paul Sperry,"Veteran FBI agents say FBI Director James Comey has permanently damaged the bureau ’ s reputation for uncompromising investigations with his “ cowardly ” whitewash of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ’ s mishandling of classified information using an unauthorized private email server .
Feeling the heat from congressional critics , Comey last week argued that the case was investigated by career FBI agents , “ So if I blew it , they blew it , too . ”
But agents say Comey tied investigators ’ hands by agreeing to unheard-of ground rules and other demands by the lawyers for Clinton and her aides that limited their investigation .
“ In my 25 years with the bureau , I never had any ground rules in my interviews , ” said retired agent Dennis V. Hughes , the first chief of the FBI ’ s computer investigations unit .
Instead of going to prosecutors and insisting on using grand jury leverage to compel testimony and seize evidence , Comey allowed immunity for several key witnesses , including potential targets .
The immunity agreements came with outrageous side deals , including preventing agents from searching for any documents on a Dell laptop owned by former Clinton chief of staff Cheryl Mills generated after Jan. 31 , 2015 , when she communicated with the server administrator who destroyed subpoenaed emails .
Comey also agreed to have Mills ’ laptop destroyed after the restricted search , denying Congress the chance to look at it and making the FBI an accomplice to the destruction of evidence .
Comey ’ s immunized witnesses nonetheless suffered chronic lapses in memory , made unsubstantiated claims of attorney-client privilege upon tougher questioning and at least two gave demonstrably false statements . And yet Comey indulged it all .

Paul Sperry , formerly Washington bureau chief for Investor ’ s Business Daily , is author of “ Infiltration . ”","Veteran FBI agents say FBI Director James Comey has permanently damaged the bureau’s reputation for uncompromising investigations with his “cowardly” whitewash of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s mishandling of classified information using an unauthorized private email server.

Feeling the heat from congressional critics, Comey last week argued that the case was investigated by career FBI agents, “So if I blew it, they blew it, too.”

But agents say Comey tied investigators’ hands by agreeing to unheard-of ground rules and other demands by the lawyers for Clinton and her aides that limited their investigation.

“In my 25 years with the bureau, I never had any ground rules in my interviews,” said retired agent Dennis V. Hughes, the first chief of the FBI’s computer investigations unit.

Instead of going to prosecutors and insisting on using grand jury leverage to compel testimony and seize evidence, Comey allowed immunity for several key witnesses, including potential targets.

The immunity agreements came with outrageous side deals, including preventing agents from searching for any documents on a Dell laptop owned by former Clinton chief of staff Cheryl Mills generated after Jan. 31, 2015, when she communicated with the server administrator who destroyed subpoenaed emails.

Comey also agreed to have Mills’ laptop destroyed after the restricted search, denying Congress the chance to look at it and making the FBI an accomplice to the destruction of evidence.

Comey’s immunized witnesses nonetheless suffered chronic lapses in memory, made unsubstantiated claims of attorney-client privilege upon tougher questioning and at least two gave demonstrably false statements. And yet Comey indulged it all.

What’s more, Comey cut a deal to give Clinton a “voluntary” witness interview on a major holiday, and even let her ex-chief of staff sit in on the interview as a lawyer, even though she, too, was under investigation.

Clinton’s interview, the culmination of a yearlong investigation, lasted just 3½ hours. Despite some 40 bouts of amnesia, she wasn’t called back for questioning; and three days later, Comey cleared her of criminal wrongdoing.

“The FBI has politicized itself, and its reputation will suffer for a long time,” Hughes said. “I hold Director Comey responsible.”

fbi,Fox Online News,2,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/newly-released-emails-show-fbi-scrambling-to-respond-to-clinton-lawyer-amid-weiner-laptop-review,"FBI scrambled to respond to Hillary Clinton lawyer amid Weiner laptop review, newly released emails show",,"Gregg Re, Quoting Emerson","Newly released internal FBI emails showed the agency 's highest-ranking officials scrambling to answer to Hillary Clinton 's lawyer in the days prior to the 2016 presidential election , on the same day then-FBI Director James Comey sent a bombshell letter to Congress announcing a new review of hundreds of thousands of potentially classified emails found on former Rep. Anthony Weiner 's laptop .
The trove of documents turned over by the FBI , in response to a lawsuit by the transparency group Judicial Watch , also included discussions by former FBI lawyer Lisa Page concerning a potential quid pro quo between the State Department and the FBI -- in which the FBI would agree to effectively hide the fact that a Clinton email was classified in exchange for more legal attache positions that would benefit the FBI abroad , and allow them to send more agents to countries where the FBI 's access is ordinarily restricted .
The quid pro quo would have involved the FBI providing some other public reason for withholding the Clinton email from disclosure amid a Freedom of Information Act request , besides its classification level . There are no indications the proposed arrangement ever took place .
And , in the face of mounting criticism aimed at the FBI , the documents revealed that Comey quoted the 19th century poet Ralph Waldo Emerson by assuring his subordinates , `` To be great is to be misunderstood . ''
The FBI did not respond to Fox News ' request for comment on the released emails .
On Oct. 28 , 2016 , Comey upended the presidential campaign by informing Congress that the FBI would quickly review the Weiner laptop . The Justice Department 's internal watchdog later faulted the FBI for failing to review the Weiner laptop through much of the fall of 2016 , and suggested it was possible that now-fired FBI Agent Peter Strzok may have slow-walked the laptop analysis until other federal prosecutors pressured the FBI to review its contents .
On the afternoon of Oct. 28 , Clinton lawyer David Kendall demanded answers from the FBI -- and the agency jumped into action , the emails showed .
STRZOK DEMANDED DECLASSIFICATION , OTHER POWERS BEFORE BECOMING NO . 2 ON MUELLER TEAM
Many of the emails found on the computer were between Clinton and her senior adviser Huma Abedin , Weiner 's now-estranged wife . Despite claims by top FBI officials , including Strzok , several of those emails were determined to contain classified information .
`` I received the email below from David Kendall and I called him back , '' then-FBI General Counsel James Baker wrote to the agency 's top brass , including Comey , Page and Strzok , in an email . `` Before doing so I alerted DOJ via email that I would do that . ''
Page and Strzok eventually were revealed to be having an extramarital affair , and Strzok was terminated after a slew of text messages surfaced in which he and Page derided Trump and his supporters using their government-issued phones . Republicans , citing some of those text messages , have accused Strzok and Page of orchestrating a coordinated leak strategy aimed at harming the president .
GOHMERT UNLOADS ON 'SMIRKING ' STRZOK : 'HOW MANY TIMES DID YOU LOOK SO INNOCENT INTO YOUR WIFE 'S EYES AND LIE ? '
Although a portion of Kendall 's email was redacted , Baker continued : `` He said that our letter was 'tantalizingly ambiguous ' and made statements that were 'inchoate and highly ominous ' such that what we had done was worse than transparency because it allows people to make whatever they want out of the letter to the prejudice of Secretary Clinton . ... I told him that I could not respond to his requests at this time but that I would discuss it with others and get back to him .
`` To be great is to be misunderstood . '' — Fired FBI Director James Comey , quoting Emerson
`` I suggest that we have some kind of follow up meeting or phone call with this group either this evening or over the weekend to address this and probably other issues/questions that come up in the next 24 hours , '' Baker concluded . `` Sound reasonable ? ''
DOJ BLAMES SYSTEM-WIDE SOFTWARE FAILURE FOR MISSING STRZOK-PAGE TEXTS ; STRZOK 'S PHONE TOTALLY WIPED
In a partially redacted response , Strzok agreed to spearhead a conference call among the FBI 's top officials the next day .
On Nov. 6 -- just two days before Election Day -- Comey sent another letter to Congress stating that agents had concluded their review of `` all of the communications '' to or from Clinton while she was secretary of state that appeared on the laptop , and that the review did not change his assessment that Clinton should not be prosecuted .
In an email also sent Nov. 6 and unearthed by Judicial Watch , Strzok wrote to the FBI 's leadership : `` [ Redacted ] , Jon and I completed our review of all of the potential HRC work emails on the [ Anthony Weiner ] laptop . We found no previously unknown , potentially classified emails on the media . ”
Strzok added that a team was coming in to `` triple-check '' his methodology and conclusions .
However , at least 18 classified emails sent from Abedin 's account were found by the FBI on the Weiner laptop . And , despite Strzok 's apparent claim , FBI officials later conceded they had not manually screened all of the nearly 700,000 emails on the laptop , but instead used computer technology to prioritize which emails to screen as Election Day rapidly approached .
ON FOUR OCCASIONS , FBI INCORRECTLY ASSURED FISA COURT THAT YAHOO ARTICLE WAS INDEPENDENT REASON TO SURVEIL TRUMP AIDE
“ It is big news that , just days before the presidential election , Hillary Clinton ’ s personal lawyer pressured the top lawyer for the FBI on the infamous Weiner laptop emails , ” Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a statement . “ These documents further underscore that the fix was in for Hillary Clinton . When will the Justice Department and FBI finally do an honest investigation of the Clinton email scandal ? ”
Separately , another email from Page , apparently sent in response to a Judicial Watch lawsuit , discussed an apparent attempt by the State Department to pressure the FBI to downgrade the classification level of a Clinton email .
`` Jason Herring will be providing you with three 302s [ witness reports ] of current and former FBI employees who were interviewed during the course of the Clinton investigation , '' Page wrote . `` These 302s are scheduled to be released to Congress in an unredacted form at the end of the week , and produced ( with redactions ) pursuant to FOIA at the beginning of next week .
Page continued : `` As you will see , they describe a discussion about potential quid pro quo arrangement between then-DAD in IOD [ deputy assistant director in International Operations Division ] and an Undersecretary at the State Department whereby IOD would get more LEGAT [ legal attaché ] positions if the FBI could change the basis of the FOIA withhold re a Clinton email from classified to something else . ''
Fox News has previously reported , citing FBI documents , that a senior State Department official proposed a quid pro quo to convince the FBI to strip the classification on an email from Clinton ’ s server – and repeatedly tried to “ influence ” the bureau ’ s decision when his offer was denied , even taking his plea up the chain of command .
In a statement at the time , the FBI acknowleged that an agency official had been in touch with the State Department about overseas positions , but denied that the conversation was tied to the classification of a Clinton email .
`` Prior to the initiation of the FBI ’ s investigation of former Secretary Clinton ’ s personal email server , the FBI was asked to review and make classification determinations on FBI emails and information which were being produced by the State Department pursuant to FOIA [ a Freedom of Information Act request ] . The FBI determined that one such email was classified at the Secret level . A senior State Department official requested the FBI re-review that email to determine whether it was in fact classified or whether it might be protected from release under a different FOIA exemption , '' the FBI said .
The statement continued : `` A now-retired FBI official , who was not part of the subsequent Clinton investigation , told the State Department official that they would look into the matter . Having been previously unsuccessful in attempts to speak with the senior State official , during the same conversation , the FBI official asked the State Department official if they would address a pending , unaddressed FBI request for space for additional FBI employees assigned abroad .
`` Following the call , the FBI official consulted with a senior FBI executive responsible for determining the classification of the material and determined the email was in fact appropriately classified at the Secret level , '' the FBI 's statement continued . `` The FBI official subsequently told the senior State official that the email was appropriately classified at the Secret level and that the FBI would not change the classification of the email . The classification of the email was not changed , and it remains classified today . Although there was never a quid pro quo , these allegations were nonetheless referred to the appropriate officials for review.​ ''
Through it all , the trove of documents suggested that top to bottom , FBI brass were convinced they were acting appropriately .
In response to a press release from Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley that criticized the FBI for failing to provide unclassified information on its Clinton probe in a timely and thorough manner to Congress , Comey quoted Emerson 's 1841 essay `` Self Reliance . ''
`` Outstanding . ... I should have added that I 'm proud of the way we have handled this release [ of unclassified information ] , '' Comey wrote to his subordinates , including Strzok , on Sept. 2 , 2016 . `` Thanks for the work on it . Just another reminder that Emerson was right when he said , 'To be great is to be misunderstood . ' Have a great and quiet weekend . ''
Page forwarded the email along to her colleagues , including Strzok , and added a smiley face .
Trump fired Comey in 2017 , leading to Special Counsel Robert Mueller 's investigation after Comey leaked a series of memos he recorded while speaking with Trump privately .
Comey acknowledged in closed-door testimony in December that as of July 2016 , investigators `` did n't know whether we had anything '' implicating Trump in improper Russia collusion , and that `` in fact , when I was fired as director [ in May 2017 ] , I still did n't know whether there was anything to it .

Separately, another email from Page, apparently sent in response to a Judicial Watch lawsuit, discussed an apparent attempt by the State Department to pressure the FBI to downgrade the classification level of a Clinton email.

""Jason Herring will be providing you with three 302s [witness reports] of current and former FBI employees who were interviewed during the course of the Clinton investigation,"" Page wrote. ""These 302s are scheduled to be released to Congress in an unredacted form at the end of the week, and produced (with redactions) pursuant to FOIA at the beginning of next week.

Page continued: ""As you will see, they describe a discussion about potential quid pro quo arrangement between then-DAD in IOD [deputy assistant director in International Operations Division] and an Undersecretary at the State Department whereby IOD would get more LEGAT [legal attaché] positions if the FBI could change the basis of the FOIA withhold re a Clinton email from classified to something else.""

Fox News has previously reported, citing FBI documents, that a senior State Department official proposed a quid pro quo to convince the FBI to strip the classification on an email from Clinton’s server – and repeatedly tried to “influence” the bureau’s decision when his offer was denied, even taking his plea up the chain of command.

In a statement at the time, the FBI acknowleged that an agency official had been in touch with the State Department about overseas positions, but denied that the conversation was tied to the classification of a Clinton email.

""Prior to the initiation of the FBI’s investigation of former Secretary Clinton’s personal email server, the FBI was asked to review and make classification determinations on FBI emails and information which were being produced by the State Department pursuant to FOIA [a Freedom of Information Act request]. The FBI determined that one such email was classified at the Secret level. A senior State Department official requested the FBI re-review that email to determine whether it was in fact classified or whether it might be protected from release under a different FOIA exemption,"" the FBI said.

The statement continued: ""A now-retired FBI official, who was not part of the subsequent Clinton investigation, told the State Department official that they would look into the matter. Having been previously unsuccessful in attempts to speak with the senior State official, during the same conversation, the FBI official asked the State Department official if they would address a pending, unaddressed FBI request for space for additional FBI employees assigned abroad.

""Following the call, the FBI official consulted with a senior FBI executive responsible for determining the classification of the material and determined the email was in fact appropriately classified at the Secret level,"" the FBI's statement continued. ""The FBI official subsequently told the senior State official that the email was appropriately classified at the Secret level and that the FBI would not change the classification of the email. The classification of the email was not changed, and it remains classified today. Although there was never a quid pro quo, these allegations were nonetheless referred to the appropriate officials for review.​""

Through it all, the trove of documents suggested that top to bottom, FBI brass were convinced they were acting appropriately.

In response to a press release from Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley that criticized the FBI for failing to provide unclassified information on its Clinton probe in a timely and thorough manner to Congress, Comey quoted Emerson's 1841 essay ""Self Reliance.""

""Outstanding. ... I should have added that I'm proud of the way we have handled this release [of unclassified information],"" Comey wrote to his subordinates, including Strzok, on Sept. 2, 2016. ""Thanks for the work on it. Just another reminder that Emerson was right when he said, 'To be great is to be misunderstood.' Have a great and quiet weekend.""

Page forwarded the email along to her colleagues, including Strzok, and added a smiley face.

Trump fired Comey in 2017, leading to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation after Comey leaked a series of memos he recorded while speaking with Trump privately.

Comey acknowledged in closed-door testimony in December that as of July 2016, investigators ""didn't know whether we had anything"" implicating Trump in improper Russia collusion, and that ""in fact, when I was fired as director [in May 2017], I still didn't know whether there was anything to it.""

We are frogs in boiling water.

When President Trump first blew the whistle — in a now-famous 2017 tweet that misspelled the word “tapp” — on the previous administration’s spying operation against his presidential campaign at the height of the election, Swamp creatures laughed. They ridiculed. They mocked.

It was a lie, they said. Never happened.

And the gaslight media backed them up. They whitewashed the whole thing for their friends in the Obama administration. And for their friends in the federal administrative state.

Today, after enduring two years of spinning, counter-leaks and relentless lies, we know officially what any sensible person knew from the beginning.

The FBI spied on an official they believed — or pretended to believe — was working inside the 2016 Trump presidential campaign on behalf of the Russian government to hijack the election and install a Manchurian candidate who would give America away to Moscow.

The FBI never alerted the Trump campaign to this grave inside threat, obviously, because the Department of Justice believed that the Trump campaign — including Mr. Trump, himself — was in on the giant con.

And therein lies the plotted coup.

Whatever you think of former President Barack Obama or Mr. Trump or Carter Page or James B. Comey or anybody’s foreign policy opinion regarding Russia or NATO or Mexico, only one thing matters in this situation. At the moment these decisions were being made to spy on the Trump campaign, Mr. Obama was president. His administration was at the controls of one of the most sprawling and sophisticated espionage apparatuses ever assembled on this planet.

At that time, Mr. Trump was an avowed political opponent. Any decision made by the Obama administration to spy on officials inside the Trump campaign was of massive, profound constitutional import. It is in these moments where a country is either a nation of laws or a banana republic.

It is either “equal justice under law” or a police state.

So, FBI agents — operating at the highest levels of DOJ authority — sought secret warrant applications normally reserved for our worst enemies such as active terrorists plotting to kill as many innocent Americans as possible.

They cobbled those secret warrant applications together with bad information supplied by — among others — Mr. Trump’s political opponents during the 2016 election. Much of that information was gathered abroad from America’s enemies seeking to sow discord in our elections.

The inspector general found specifically at least 17 “significant errors or omissions” in the FBI’s secret warrant applications.

Again, do not forget, the Obama administration took all these drastic and sloppy steps against a political opponent at the height of a presidential race — without ever alerting the campaign of this dastardly threat inside its campaign.

This is, literally, worse than Watergate. This is worse than the most egregious abuses of power by J. Edgar Hoover in his campaign of spying on political opponents.

The Obama administration officials responsible for this miscarriage of justice and trampling of the Constitution now step forward and admit they spied on political opponents at the height of an election — though they scramble to find softer-sounding terms for it.

And they bleat about how the inspector general found no evidence of “political bias” in their espionage campaign against the Trump campaign.

Give me a break.

First, there is plenty of evidence of deep-seeded hatred of Mr. Trump spewed these biased jackboots. Second, what on earth is “political bias,” anyway? Wearing an “I’m With Her” T-shirt while applying for a secret warrant to spy on the administration’s political opponents?

Yeah, well, I am sure John Wilkes Booth was not motivated by “political bias,” either.

But other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play?

US prosecutors say Paul Manafort, Donald Trump's former campaign chief, has breached a plea bargain agreement by repeatedly lying to the FBI.

Manafort was convicted of financial fraud in August relating to his work as a political consultant in Ukraine.

He then accepted a plea deal on other charges in return for co-operating with Robert Mueller's probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

Manafort's lawyers say they believe he provided truthful information

However, Special Counsel Robert Mueller said that Manafort lied ""on a variety of subject matters"" after signing the plea deal.

The latest development means that Mr Mueller's investigation has lost a key witness.

Manafort's lawyers insist that he did not breach the plea deal - however, both sides now agree that there is no reason to delay sentencing.

President Trump lashed out at the special counsel on Tuesday morning.

What was the plea deal?

In August Manafort was convicted on eight counts of fraud, bank fraud and failing to disclose bank accounts.

A month later he pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy against the US and one charge of conspiracy to obstruct justice in a plea bargain with Mr Mueller. The agreement avoided a second trial on money laundering and other charges.

The plea deal meant Manafort would face up to 10 years in prison and would forfeit four of his properties and the contents of several bank accounts - but deadlocked charges from the previous trial would be dismissed.

It was the first criminal trial arising from the justice department's investigation into alleged Russian interference in the presidential elections.

However, the charges related only to Manafort's political consulting with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, largely pre-dating his role with the Trump campaign.

The White House has insisted that the guilty plea had absolutely nothing to do with President Trump.

What does Robert Mueller say now?

In a court filing on Monday, Mr Mueller said that after signing the deal ""Manafort committed federal crimes by lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Special Counsel's office on a variety of subject matters"".

The filing did not give details of what Manafort allegedly lied about.

As prosecutors allege he breached the agreement, Manafort could now potentially face harsher sentences or have charges against him re-filed.

Manafort has been held in a detention centre in Virginia since June.

What are the wider repercussions?

This is seen as a blow to Mr Mueller's Russia probe. As investigators no longer believe Manafort is a credible witness, they will not be able to use his testimony in their case.

Experts say Manafort could now face a longer prison sentence and more criminal charges.

One lawyer told Reuters that the consequences could be ""potentially devastating"" for Manafort.

However, some observers have speculated that Manafort might be hoping for a presidential pardon.

In fact , the most hair-raising section of the report , an entire chapter , is devoted to communications among several FBI officials ( not just the infamous duo of Peter Strzok and Lisa Page ) , which overflow with abhorrence for Trump ( “ loathsome , ” “ an idiot , ” “ awful , ” “ an enormous d * * che , ” “ f * * k Trump ” ) and his core supporters ( “ retarded , ” “ the crazies , ” one could “ smell ” them ) . More alarmingly , the agents express a determination to stop Trump from becoming president ( e.g. , Strzok , on being asked if Trump would become president , says “ No . No he ’ s not . We ’ ll stop it ” ; and on being assured that his election is highly unlikely , opines that “ we can ’ t take that risk ” and that the bureau needs “ an insurance policy ” against him ) .
Despite marshaling this damning proof of bias , Horowitz spends much of his report discounting it with respect to individual investigative decisions .
Yet despite marshaling this damning proof of bias , Horowitz spends much of his report discounting it with respect to individual investigative decisions . His approach obscures more than it illuminates . The IG says it is not his burden to second-guess “ discretionary ” investigative decisions unless they were irrational . Thus , even if agents exhibited bias , he presumes that such decisions as granting immunity , declining to seek relevant evidence , or forgoing subpoenas are defensible as long as some government policy arguably supports them — even if other , better options were available . FBI director Christopher Wray has pounced on this , disingenuously arguing that the IG “ did not find any evidence of political bias or improper considerations impacting the investigation. ” It is a misleading comment : The IG found overwhelming evidence of bias and merely withheld judgment on whether it affected the investigation at key points .
Of course , what principally drove decisions in the Clinton-emails investigation ( or “ matter , ” as Obama attorney general Loretta Lynch , like the Clinton campaign , insisted it be called ) was the certainty that President Obama and his Justice Department were never going to permit Secretary Clinton to be charged with a crime , notwithstanding the abundant evidence . ( Without a hint of irony , the report ’ s executive summary speaks of the supposed difficulty of proving Clinton ’ s knowledge of the hundreds of classified emails inevitably on her system , and then explains that the FBI abjured use of the grand jury because it would have required exposing prodigious amounts of classified information . ) That is , regardless of whether individual decisions were driven by pro-Clinton bias , the predetermined outcome surely was . That ’ s why then-director James Comey was drafting his exoneration remarks months before critical evidence was obtained , and before Clinton and other key witnesses were interviewed .
A comparison between the handling of the Clinton emails and that of the Trump-Russia probes would almost certainly illustrate the influence of this bias , but that is exactly what the IG report lacks .
The report ’ s fans will say this is strictly a matter of timing : The IG ’ s Clinton-emails report has been 18 months in the making ; it may take the IG even longer to complete the Trump-Russia review , and it would be unreasonable to delay any reckoning that long . But the fact that the IG ’ s inquiries into the two probes are on different tracks does not alter the more essential fact that the two are inextricably linked . They were conducted at the same time , by the same sets of top FBI agents and Justice Department officials , in the operating environment of the same event — the 2016 election .
They were , moreover , perceived as interrelated by the agents themselves . Strzok ’ s first reaction , upon hearing that Ted Cruz had withdrawn from the GOP race , leaving Trump as the de facto nominee , was that this meant the Clinton-emails probe had to be wrapped up ( i.e. , formally closed without charges ) . When the Trump-Russia investigation got rolling , Strzok commented that , compared to the Clinton-emails probe , this was the investigation that really “ MATTERS ” ( emphasis in original ) . And here is Strzok the day after Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel , on the opportunity to join his investigation of now-president Trump :
For me , and this case , I personally have a sense of unfinished business . I unleashed it with MYE [ Mid Year Exam — the FBI ’ s codeword for the Clinton Emails investigation ] . Now I need to fix it and finish it .
Later in the same exchange he adds that this is a choice of whether he wants to be just another FBI assistant director or participate in an “ investigation leading to impeachment . ”
It ’ s only Horowitz ’ s extremely forgiving standard for judging investigative decisions that allows him to say that the impact of bias on the Clinton investigation is inconclusive . This is not to dismiss the usefulness of the IG ’ s report . It reaffirms that the president had ample legitimate grounds to dismiss Director Comey , who is shown to be insubordinate and deceptive , a self-absorbed law unto himself . Furthermore , the IG ’ s equivocation about the role of bias does not detract from his powerful condemnation of the disrepute rogue agents have brought on the bureau . Still , there is important work left to be done in fully accounting for the decisions of an FBI whose reputation won ’ t soon recover from its performance in 2016 .","Former FBI Director James Comey at a news conference in 2014.

The IG extensively takes on numerous issues related to the decision not to charge former secretary of state Hillary Clinton for, primarily, causing the retention and transmission of classified information on the non-secure “homebrew” server system through which she improperly and systematically conducted government business. (Our Dan McLaughlin usefully catalogues the topics Horowitz addresses here.) If there is a single theme that ties the sprawling report together, however, it is bias.

In fact, the most hair-raising section of the report, an entire chapter, is devoted to communications among several FBI officials (not just the infamous duo of Peter Strzok and Lisa Page), which overflow with abhorrence for Trump (“loathsome,” “an idiot,” “awful,” “an enormous d**che,” “f**k Trump”) and his core supporters (“retarded,” “the crazies,” one could “smell” them).

We’ll stop it”; and on being assured that his election is highly unlikely, opines that “we can’t take that risk” and that the bureau needs “an insurance policy” against him).

Despite marshaling this damning proof of bias, Horowitz spends much of his report discounting it with respect to individual investigative decisions.

Yet despite marshaling this damning proof of bias, Horowitz spends much of his report discounting it with respect to individual investigative decisions. His approach obscures more than it illuminates. The IG says it is not his burden to second-guess “discretionary” investigative decisions unless they were irrational. Thus, even if agents exhibited bias, he presumes that such decisions as granting immunity, declining to seek relevant evidence, or forgoing subpoenas are defensible as long as some government policy arguably supports them — even if other, better options were available. FBI director Christopher Wray has pounced on this, disingenuously arguing that the IG “did not find any evidence of political bias or improper considerations impacting the investigation.” It is a misleading comment: The IG found overwhelming evidence of bias and merely withheld judgment on whether it affected the investigation at key points.

Of course, what principally drove decisions in the Clinton-emails investigation (or “matter,” as Obama attorney general Loretta Lynch, like the Clinton campaign, insisted it be called) was the certainty that President Obama and his Justice Department were never going to permit Secretary Clinton to be charged with a crime, notwithstanding the abundant evidence. (Without a hint of irony, the report’s executive summary speaks of the supposed difficulty of proving Clinton’s knowledge of the hundreds of classified emails inevitably on her system, and then explains that the FBI abjured use of the grand jury because it would have required exposing prodigious amounts of classified information.) That is, regardless of whether individual decisions were driven by pro-Clinton bias, the predetermined outcome surely was. That’s why then-director James Comey was drafting his exoneration remarks months before critical evidence was obtained, and before Clinton and other key witnesses were interviewed.

A comparison between the handling of the Clinton emails and that of the Trump-Russia probes would almost certainly illustrate the influence of this bias, but that is exactly what the IG report lacks.

The report’s fans will say this is strictly a matter of timing: The IG’s Clinton-emails report has been 18 months in the making; it may take the IG even longer to complete the Trump-Russia review, and it would be unreasonable to delay any reckoning that long. But the fact that the IG’s inquiries into the two probes are on different tracks does not alter the more essential fact that the two are inextricably linked. They were conducted at the same time, by the same sets of top FBI agents and Justice Department officials, in the operating environment of the same event — the 2016 election.

They were, moreover, perceived as interrelated by the agents themselves. Strzok’s first reaction, upon hearing that Ted Cruz had withdrawn from the GOP race, leaving Trump as the de facto nominee, was that this meant the Clinton-emails probe had to be wrapped up (i.e., formally closed without charges). When the Trump-Russia investigation got rolling, Strzok commented that, compared to the Clinton-emails probe, this was the investigation that really “MATTERS” (emphasis in original). And here is Strzok the day after Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel, on the opportunity to join his investigation of now-president Trump:

For me, and this case, I personally have a sense of unfinished business. I unleashed it with MYE [Mid Year Exam — the FBI’s codeword for the Clinton Emails investigation]. Now I need to fix it and finish it.

Later in the same exchange he adds that this is a choice of whether he wants to be just another FBI assistant director or participate in an “investigation leading to impeachment.”

It’s only Horowitz’s extremely forgiving standard for judging investigative decisions that allows him to say that the impact of bias on the Clinton investigation is inconclusive. This is not to dismiss the usefulness of the IG’s report. It reaffirms that the president had ample legitimate grounds to dismiss Director Comey, who is shown to be insubordinate and deceptive, a self-absorbed law unto himself. Furthermore, the IG’s equivocation about the role of bias does not detract from his powerful condemnation of the disrepute rogue agents have brought on the bureau. Still, there is important work left to be done in fully accounting for the decisions of an FBI whose reputation won’t soon recover from its performance in 2016.

A reminder that barring some dramatic disclosure in from that inquiry, 96 senators have already made up their minds. How the remaining groups sees the new background information -- and how it factors into their decisions -- will drive the day.

It all comes down to five senators -- three Republicans and two Democrats -- and what they see today behind closed doors. Here are the rules senators are following to review the documents.

The format

Judiciary Committee Republican staff got the first look at the FBI's findings starting at 8 a.m. ET. At 9 a.m. ET, Democrats took over the room. Control of the room is scheduled to rotate, every other hour, for the rest of Thursday.

The staff that is cleared to review the material will provide briefings, likely to groups of senators, and the senators will be able to review the raw 302s themselves.

Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, told reporters that staff from the office of Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley are reading the report aloud to senators and then other interviews (that aren't being read aloud) are being passed around for senators to look at.

There is only one copy, which is making things interesting.

""We are trying to get it all done efficiently,"" Johnson said.

The rules

This FBI's work is not public. It will likely never be public. There will be no summary. There will be no release.

There are 109 people who have clearance to access what was delivered to Capitol Hill at 2:30 Thursday morning -- 100 senators, four majority committee staffers and four minority committee staffers, one committee clerk. That's it.

There is a single copy of the FBI's findings. It is currently in a vault, in a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility -- or SCIF, if you'd like to use the Washington short hand. It cannot leave the room.

Senators can't bring their phones into the SCIF when they go to review the documents. If they take notes, the notes must be left in the room when the senator leaves.

Senators are not allowed to discuss or characterize in detail what they've read (though they most certainly will try.)

Inside the room

Johnson told reporters that in the SCIF, there are little stands with microphones, where the judiciary staff is ""somewhat taking turns"" briefing lawmakers from the FBI report.

""I've never seen anything like that before,"" Johnson told reporters. ""This is unusual circumstances calling for kind of (an) unusual process.""

Johnson said the staff will stay as long as people want to come read the report.

""There is discussion too. There are questions being answered,"" Johnson said. ""I personally find it to be a pretty good, pretty efficient process.""

What that means

The public is expected to only be able to gauge what's in the FBI's findings in two ways:

First: the topline characterizations of senators who read the documents. Reminder these senators have very specific motivations for how they characterize what they see, especially given it won't be publicly released.

Second: By the votes on the Senate floor. If the undecided senators all get to ""yes,"" then they saw something that assuaged their concerns -- or at least didn't create any more.

Important point

This is, quite literally, how the process is designed to work, as guided by a bipartisan Judiciary Committee memorandum of understanding signed in 2009. Background investigations are not supposed to be made public -- in fact, it's against the law to do so. The limited number of people with access, the restrictions on public disclosure, even the number of copies provided, are all dictated by rules the committee agreed to nine years ago.

It's worth noting -- Republican senators discussed for days whether there was a way to make some form of the information public, either in summary form or some other mechanism. It was decided that given the rules in place, and the potential legal issues, it isn't doable at this point.

What the White House is saying

The White House has explored ways to make some of the FBI report public, an official familiar with the deliberations says, but lawyers have determined it would be very difficult without violating the Privacy Act or the memorandum of understanding that dictates how the information is shared.

Officials feel if the report was made public it would prove the ""no corroboration"" line they and Senate Republicans have been projecting this morning. But as of Thursday morning, they believe there is very little they will be able to make public, or comment on specifically.

Separately, a senior White House official told CNN they won't call for the release of the background investigation — and claims the Senate can't release it either.

What Senate GOP leaders believe right now

Multiple senior GOP aides expressed confidence Wednesday night that Kavanaugh was on the path to confirmation -- though all acknowledged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell still hasn't received any commitments or assurances from the undecided senators.

The expectation, aides say, is barring some significant new disclosure in the FBI inquiry, they'll make it over the vote threshold to get Kavanaugh confirmed.

""We've made sure they got what they needed,"" one of the aides said. ""Now we move forward.""

fbi,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/2/fbi-surveillance-teams-frustrated-by-nepotism-and-/,FBI surveillance teams frustrated by nepotism and internal politics,2015-03-02,Kelly Riddell,"Members of the FBI surveillance teams that secretly track terrorists , spies and mobsters on U.S. soil are increasingly frustrated their mission is being hampered by internal politics and nepotism , according to interviews and documents .
FBI memos reviewed by The ███ show at least three younger relatives of high-ranking bureau supervisors have landed jobs on the elite surveillance teams in recent years , with two fast-tracked to full special agent status .
In addition , some FBI local offices that ranked high on a threat and needs matrix for surveillance were passed over for new teams last year in favor of more politically connected offices that ranked lower , the records show .
The worries have grown so widespread that one longtime decorated surveillance team member has sought whistleblower protection , taking his colleagues ’ concerns to both the Justice Department ’ s inspector general and the Senate Committee on the Judiciary .
The whistleblower told The Times he initially went to supervisors , who dismissed the problems and then gave him a poor personnel review . So he then went to Congress because he fears current practices are jeopardizing the war on terror and the bureau ’ s counterintelligence operations .
“ Who gets what surveillance teams — it ’ s now all about bias and favoritism and the good ol ’ boy system , ” the whistleblower said in an interview with The Times , speaking only on condition of anonymity because his identity is supposed to remain secret during surveillance . “ My division — although we had the statistics to prove we needed more personnel — got skipped over because executive management had an ax to grind . ”
FBI officials readily acknowledge a handful of top managers ’ children or relatives landed jobs on the surveillance teams , but they insist the hirings were governed by the bureau ’ s strongly worded policy that outlaws favoritism in hiring .
“ All applicants go through a rigorous selection process , including structured interviews and security background investigations , ” the bureau said . “ Personnel matters that have the potential of being viewed as an act of nepotism are subject to appropriate administrative action . ”
The FBI also confirmed that some offices that scored high for surveillance needs were skipped over in favor of lower-ranked offices .
Officials said that while the matrix evaluation was carefully conducted , it also allowed for some discretion by managers to change rankings .
“ Due to limited resources , not all field offices that qualified for an additional surveillance team were provided one . Both the selection process and the final determinations were subjected to an extensive review process and approved by executive management , ” the bureau said in its statement to The Times .
The whistleblower disclosures come at a sensitive time for the bureau , which still faces questions as to why it had not more aggressively tracked the Tsarnaev brothers , who are suspected in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing , after Russian authorities had tipped the agency about the pair .
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley , Iowa Republican , said his office is examining the whistleblower ’ s concerns , particularly on how the FBI initially handled the accusations and their employee when he came forward .
“ Whenever an employee comes forward like this with concerns about waste and mismanagement , the Bureau should be grateful that it has someone willing to step up and point out problems , ” Mr. Grassley said in a statement to The ███ . “ But too often , the whistleblower gets punished for doing the right thing . ”
The whistleblower ’ s personnel file shows that , for most of the last two decades , he received high ratings and frequent praise for his surveillance work , including numerous awards and commendations as well as personal letters of gratitude directly from FBI directors when he worked in the Washington , D.C. , area . He received a rating of “ excellent ” in 2013 in his new division .
But after he questioned management in 2014 as to why his division was passed over for a new surveillance team it had earned in the rankings , the whistleblower was given a first-ever negative evaluation .
“ I ’ ve been retaliated against just for asking a fair question , ” he told The Times .
The surveillance units — often known as “ G-teams ” — consist of covert tracking specialists who do not have the rank of special agents , and they are funded through the black budget since they work on counterterrorism and counterintelligence .
Their exact whereabouts and numbers are generally kept secret from the public — as are the identities of the team members . But a nonclassified memo obtained by The Times indicated there are 54 field offices spread across the country , with about eight people on an average team , and many cities qualify for multiple teams .
Congress gets regular reports on the program because of its sensitive work and the possibility that surveillance of Americans could violate privacy rights . Reports of activities are prepared about every six months , but Congress at any time can request the information , and has been doing so more as terrorist jihad groups grow overseas .
But some team members , including the whistleblower , expressed concerns that Congress was being kept in the dark about surveillance staffing decisions and hirings that aren ’ t being made on merits .
One email shows a supervisor directly dismissed the whistleblower ’ s concerns that Congress should be notified .
“ The Senate has much more important work to do than worry about which offices received assets , ” Scott Brunner , a former FBI assistant special agent in charge , wrote in an April 2014 email to the whistleblower .
Mr. Brunner has since left the division , becoming the legal attache for the FBI ’ s Bogota , Colombia , office . He did not return phone calls seeking comment .
The whistleblower related a story about how his division superiors wanted to promote an older FBI employee to the surveillance team because his appearance and skills matched the job , but they were turned down by Washington . They also were rejected for an additional team after scoring high on the list of offices in need of surveillance expansion .
The whistleblower said he was told the reason for both rejections was office politics , essentially bad blood between a supervisor in his division and the surveillance brass in Washington .
The whistleblower ’ s account is echoed in an email from a senior official in Washington who handled the surveillance program scoring system .
The email says his effort to alert his bosses that resources may not be properly delegated was altered by Washington bureaucrats . “ They changed my white paper , the degree to which I don ’ t know , ” the Washington supervisor wrote in 2014 .
He noted that the unit leadership held “ disdain ” for the whistleblower ’ s office that affected decisions . And some surveillance team members across the country were disturbed that the unit boss “ has so much power ” and “ exercises most of it with little oversight , if any , from superiors , ” he wrote in the email .
Other “ G-team ” leaders voiced similar frustrations in interviews or contemporaneous documents . FBI offices with just one team would like to either have a staff member added to handle their administrative work or be paid more to do the extra workload themselves .
After voicing these complaints , another team member in a Midwestern division was told by Washington brass that an additional team may happen if the complaints stopped . He responded he couldn ’ t be bought . Statistically , that division didn ’ t qualify for another team on a needs basis , but it did want an added coordinator , according to interviews .
The FBI now investigates an average of more than six new terrorist threats per day , according to the most recent statistics , which were compiled back in 2004 , and the G-teams often find themselves as part of some of the FBI ’ s biggest cases . The teams started operations in the 1970s in New York City as a pilot program using their spycraft to help track and monitor potential Soviet threats .
One of their greatest successes was helping to discover Robert Hanssen , a former FBI official who spied for the Soviet Union for 20 years , all the while working for U.S. intelligence .
Shortly after their pilot program , the G-teams went national . The organization has grown from a few employees into a sprawling bureaucracy .
Growth of those units has created an opportunity , however , for some of the FBI ’ s top management to place adult children into the surveillance teams as a way of getting them on a fast track to becoming an agent .
According to documents and interviews , there have been at least three paternal hirings in recent years within the FBI ’ s special surveillance group . Two of those operatives advanced to become FBI special agents , and the third remains on a G-team .
In addition , a fourth nepotism case has been alleged involving a resident agency that , alongside the local G-team , reports to the Little Rock , Arkansas , FBI office . That person later landed a plum job in the Washington office of FBI Director James B. Comey .
G-team members told The Times they did not oppose hiring agents ’ relatives if they were qualified and willing to learn the craft of surveillance , but many seemed to just be passing through as ticket punchers , and one had serious skill deficiencies .
For example , a G-team member hired in the late- ‘ 90s was the son of a well-known FBI legal attache and special agent in charge in Europe .
The son was retained by the FBI even though he failed his map-reading test six times before being placed on a surveillance team , according to a source inside the bureau who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation . Usually one failure would be enough to remove an operative from the elite program , insiders say , because map reading is a necessary skill within the espionage world .
Eventually , the agent ’ s son was promoted to a supervisory special agent in New York City , records show .
In another case , a G-team operative hired last year was the child of an assistant unit chief in the surveillance program . The candidate got to choose which office he wanted to work in — a rarity in the surveillance unit , which sends personnel where surveillance is most needed . He chose an office where his father had good friends and therefore would receive good treatment , according to interviews .
A third G-team member , hired a few years ago , was the daughter of a high-ranking and decorated FBI official key to the bureau ’ s languages program , and was a highly decorated agent . The woman has now risen to become an agent herself in the Washington , D.C. , area .
Separately from the G-teams , in a resident agency that reports to Little Rock , Arkansas , a position within the FBI was held for the offspring of an agency supervisor until the child graduated from college . The woman ended up graduating from school a semester late , but the division held the position open until she could graduate .
The student ’ s job was to report directly to her father , so the FBI , not wanting to set off alarm bells , hired another supervisor so she could report to a nonrelative .
Later , when the father was transferred to a legal attache office overseas , the daughter was given a plum position in Washington , D.C. , working in the FBI director ’ s office — just a year after graduating from college .
The Times chose not to name any of the three G-team operatives or the FBI hire to avoid compromising their current or past undercover surveillance work or alerting terrorists to their identity .
Government watchdogs say the surveillance team members and the public have reason to be concerned about the hiring pattern .
“ When hiring decisions are based on who you know rather than what you know , the federal government isn ’ t operating to its fullest potential , ” said Scott Amey , the general counsel at the nonpartisan Project on Government Oversight . “ We don ’ t like cozy relationships and sweetheart deals when it comes to contractors or grantees , and the same holds true for pulling strings to benefit family and friends . ”
The Justice Department , which oversees the bureau , has been plagued with nepotism charges over the past decade .
A DOJ inspector general report released last month found the head of the International Crime Police Organization , another law enforcement agency , used his position to secure a job for his son and other relatives .
And a November investigation discovered certain offices in the DOJ had a “ pervasive culture of nepotism and favoritism , ” making it at least the fifth inspector general report since 2004 to find hiring problems at the agency .
In response to the repeated nepotism charges , Justice said it would strengthen its hiring training for employees , especially regarding the agency ’ s nepotism rules .
“ There is no room for nepotism in the federal government ’ s hiring practices , ” Rep. Bob Goodlatte , Virginia Republican and House Judiciary Committee chairman , said recently . “ Those hired to serve taxpayers must earn — not be given — the job . ”","Members of the FBI surveillance teams that secretly track terrorists, spies and mobsters on U.S. soil are increasingly frustrated their mission is being hampered by internal politics and nepotism, according to interviews and documents.

FBI memos reviewed by The Washington Times show at least three younger relatives of high-ranking bureau supervisors have landed jobs on the elite surveillance teams in recent years, with two fast-tracked to full special agent status.

In addition, some FBI local offices that ranked high on a threat and needs matrix for surveillance were passed over for new teams last year in favor of more politically connected offices that ranked lower, the records show.

The worries have grown so widespread that one longtime decorated surveillance team member has sought whistleblower protection, taking his colleagues’ concerns to both the Justice Department’s inspector general and the Senate Committee on the Judiciary.

The whistleblower told The Times he initially went to supervisors, who dismissed the problems and then gave him a poor personnel review. So he then went to Congress because he fears current practices are jeopardizing the war on terror and the bureau’s counterintelligence operations.

“Who gets what surveillance teams — it’s now all about bias and favoritism and the good ol’ boy system,” the whistleblower said in an interview with The Times, speaking only on condition of anonymity because his identity is supposed to remain secret during surveillance. “My division — although we had the statistics to prove we needed more personnel — got skipped over because executive management had an ax to grind.”

FBI officials readily acknowledge a handful of top managers’ children or relatives landed jobs on the surveillance teams, but they insist the hirings were governed by the bureau’s strongly worded policy that outlaws favoritism in hiring.

“All applicants go through a rigorous selection process, including structured interviews and security background investigations,” the bureau said. “Personnel matters that have the potential of being viewed as an act of nepotism are subject to appropriate administrative action.”

The FBI also confirmed that some offices that scored high for surveillance needs were skipped over in favor of lower-ranked offices.

Officials said that while the matrix evaluation was carefully conducted, it also allowed for some discretion by managers to change rankings.

“Due to limited resources, not all field offices that qualified for an additional surveillance team were provided one. Both the selection process and the final determinations were subjected to an extensive review process and approved by executive management,” the bureau said in its statement to The Times.

The whistleblower disclosures come at a sensitive time for the bureau, which still faces questions as to why it had not more aggressively tracked the Tsarnaev brothers, who are suspected in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, after Russian authorities had tipped the agency about the pair.

Congress concerned

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican, said his office is examining the whistleblower’s concerns, particularly on how the FBI initially handled the accusations and their employee when he came forward.

“Whenever an employee comes forward like this with concerns about waste and mismanagement, the Bureau should be grateful that it has someone willing to step up and point out problems,” Mr. Grassley said in a statement to The Washington Times. “But too often, the whistleblower gets punished for doing the right thing.”

The whistleblower’s personnel file shows that, for most of the last two decades, he received high ratings and frequent praise for his surveillance work, including numerous awards and commendations as well as personal letters of gratitude directly from FBI directors when he worked in the Washington, D.C., area. He received a rating of “excellent” in 2013 in his new division.

But after he questioned management in 2014 as to why his division was passed over for a new surveillance team it had earned in the rankings, the whistleblower was given a first-ever negative evaluation.

“I’ve been retaliated against just for asking a fair question,” he told The Times.

The surveillance units — often known as “G-teams” — consist of covert tracking specialists who do not have the rank of special agents, and they are funded through the black budget since they work on counterterrorism and counterintelligence.

Their exact whereabouts and numbers are generally kept secret from the public — as are the identities of the team members. But a nonclassified memo obtained by The Times indicated there are 54 field offices spread across the country, with about eight people on an average team, and many cities qualify for multiple teams.

Data accuracy questions

Congress gets regular reports on the program because of its sensitive work and the possibility that surveillance of Americans could violate privacy rights. Reports of activities are prepared about every six months, but Congress at any time can request the information, and has been doing so more as terrorist jihad groups grow overseas.

But some team members, including the whistleblower, expressed concerns that Congress was being kept in the dark about surveillance staffing decisions and hirings that aren’t being made on merits.

One email shows a supervisor directly dismissed the whistleblower’s concerns that Congress should be notified.

“The Senate has much more important work to do than worry about which offices received assets,” Scott Brunner, a former FBI assistant special agent in charge, wrote in an April 2014 email to the whistleblower.

Mr. Brunner has since left the division, becoming the legal attache for the FBI’s Bogota, Colombia, office. He did not return phone calls seeking comment.

The whistleblower related a story about how his division superiors wanted to promote an older FBI employee to the surveillance team because his appearance and skills matched the job, but they were turned down by Washington. They also were rejected for an additional team after scoring high on the list of offices in need of surveillance expansion.

The whistleblower said he was told the reason for both rejections was office politics, essentially bad blood between a supervisor in his division and the surveillance brass in Washington.

Politics at play in terror war?

The whistleblower’s account is echoed in an email from a senior official in Washington who handled the surveillance program scoring system.

The email says his effort to alert his bosses that resources may not be properly delegated was altered by Washington bureaucrats. “They changed my white paper, the degree to which I don’t know,” the Washington supervisor wrote in 2014.

And some surveillance team members across the country were disturbed that the unit boss “has so much power” and “exercises most of it with little oversight, if any, from superiors,” he wrote in the email.

Nepotism concerns surface

Lawmakers remain unhappy.

A wild turn of events on Friday flipped a new FBI investigation into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh from a long shot into a sure thing.

That was one result of an eleventh-hour agreement among the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee after a contentious session of offstage horse-trading.

The panel voted to recommend the embattled Kavanaugh to the full Senate on the condition that the final floor vote not take place until after the FBI conducted a background investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct confronting the nominee.

The inquiry would be ""limited in scope"" and completed within a week. The White House later Friday ordered the bureau to do just that. The FBI is expected to produce a report for the White House, which the administration would then give the Senate.

The compromise

Democrats and outside groups had been calling for the FBI's involvement since the allegations by Christine Blasey Ford and other women first surfaced that Kavanaugh had assaulted them or committed other such acts — allegations that Kavanaugh strongly denies.

Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., pitched the delay and new investigation to his compatriots, apparently setting that as his condition for ultimately supporting Kavanaugh on the Senate floor.

Republican leaders, who need every vote they can get to confirm the nominee, agreed.

Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, had opposed involving the FBI but said Friday he would take up Flake's case. Ultimately he secured an agreement with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.

""We've had a good day today by moving the nominee,"" Grassley told reporters. ""A good day. We're very happy with the progress we've made.""

Democrats said the compromise was the right move.

""I think it will be better for the country that this FBI investigation occur,"" Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., told NPR. ""I'm not sure what the answers will be. It's possible some of the witnesses won't even agree to talk with FBI. ... But to think we wouldn't even try would be the saddest thing for the country.""

What happens next

The new deadline for a Kavanaugh vote is Oct. 5. Grassley asked President Trump to instruct the FBI to spend that week conducting interviews, reviewing documents and looking into the new accusations.

The president agreed.

""The supplemental FBI background investigation would be limited to current credible allegations against the nominee and must be completed no later than one week from today,"" Grassley said.

It wasn't immediately clear whether ""current credible allegations"" would mean the FBI would interview only people connected with Ford's case or with some of the other women who have come forward with allegations against Kavanaugh.

The FBI is unlikely to open a criminal investigation. Instead, its investigators are expected to pursue the same kind of background inquiry they have conducted on Kavanaugh in the past, focused on the new allegations.

The nominee said in a statement released by the White House that he would go along.

""Throughout this process, I've been interviewed by the FBI, I've done a number of 'background' calls directly with the Senate, and yesterday, I answered questions under oath about every topic the Senators and their counsel asked me,"" Kavanaugh said. ""I've done everything they have requested and will continue to cooperate.""

At least one key player in this drama also volunteered to talk: Mark Judge — a boyhood friend of Kavanaugh's who has been accused by Ford of being a bystander to her sexual assault and was named in other allegations — said in a letter to the Judiciary Committee that he would cooperate under certain conditions.

Judge renewed his denials about being involved with any sexual misconduct and said that he would ""cooperate with any law enforcement agency that is assigned to confidentially investigate these allegations.""

Why would the FBI make a difference?

It's a crime to lie to Congress, but lying to the FBI is a whole other matter. And there is a practical difference between people in the Kavanaugh case issuing written statements — as Judge and others have done — and actually sitting down with human special agents.

Investigators might glean details from people involved that aren't yet in the public eye. They might discover there are more people, including witnesses or others, than have been a part of the public accounting so far.

But the FBI will not give its own determination about the truthfulness of what witnesses say — one reason Grassley and Kavanaugh both earlier said they opposed activating the bureau. Investigators probably only will conduct interviews and then pass them to the Senate, they said.

Even if the bureau serves only as a gold-plated transcription service in this case, the completeness of those transcripts might exceed the body of evidence that now exists — and it would be evidence obtained from witnesses who could be prosecuted if they lied to the feds.

Democrats and outside groups — and now, Flake — argue that the information that has surfaced recently means the FBI must look into Kavanaugh again.

Ford told the Judiciary Committee she hadn't told anyone about her alleged sexual assault by the 1990s, when Kavanaugh was screened for a job in the Justice Department, or even by the early 2000s, when he was cleared to work in the White House of President George W. Bush.

Many Republicans say the due diligence on Kavanaugh already was complete. Now that the Judiciary Committee has voted to recommend him to the full Senate, they argue, the full chamber must decide.

fbi,Fox Online News,2,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/russia-probe-flashback-7-ways-fbi-actions-raised-bias-questions,Russia probe flashback: 7 ways FBI actions raised bias questions,,Maxim Lott,"The conclusion of Special Counsel Robert Mueller ’ s investigation – and its determination that no evidence supports claims of Trump-Russia collusion – has spurred calls from President Trump ’ s allies to closely examine the probe ’ s origins at the FBI .
Trump , for his part , called to “ look into ” those who had created a “ false narrative ” sparking the investigation . Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , has already vowed to look into the FBI ’ s actions .
Here are just seven FBI actions and comments , covered in controversial text messages , that have raised questions about the impartiality of the probe .
On Aug. 8 , 2016 , FBI lawyer Lisa Page texted her lover , Peter Strzok , who was in charge of the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton and later worked on the Russia probe : `` [ Trump 's ] not ever going to become president , right ? Right ? ! ''
Strzok responded on his FBI-issued work phone : `` No . No he wo n't . We 'll stop it . ''
The text was discovered by the inspector general at the U.S. Department of Justice , after the FBI failed to uncover the message on its own .
“ It is not only indicative of a biased state of mind but , even more seriously , implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate ’ s electoral prospects , ” the IG report stated .
The inspector general ’ s office also asked Strzok for his response .
“ When asked about this text message , Strzok stated that he did not specifically recall sending it , but that he believed that it was intended to reassure Page that Trump would not be elected , not to suggest that he would do something to impact the investigation , ” the report notes .
Strzok later told the House Judiciary Committee that he meant Americans in general would stop Trump in 2016 .
Strzok calls Russia investigation an ‘ insurance policy ’ in case Trump wins
In an Aug. 15 , 2016 text message , Strzok told Page : `` I want to believe ... that there 's no way Trump gets elected—but I 'm afraid we ca n't take that risk . It 's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you 're 40 . ''
Critics say the text implies Strzok wanted the investigation to hurt Trump in case he were to win .
Strzok told the IG and the House Judiciary Committee that his text meant an investigation should happen right away .
“ My use of the phrase ‘ insurance policy ’ was simply to say , while the polls or people might think it is less likely that then-candidate Trump would be elected , that should not influence ... us doing our job responsibly , ” Strzok told the House Judiciary Committee .
Strzok admits in 2017 ‘ there 's no big there there ’ on Russian collusion
Despite having called the Russia situation an “ insurance policy ” and having pressed for more vigorous investigation , a text from May 17 , 2017 shows Strzok had doubts .
In texts to Page , Strzok questioned whether he should join Mueller ’ s team investigating Trump and Russia because : `` you and I both know the odds are nothing . If I thought it was likely I 'd be there no question . I hesitate in part because of my gut sense and concern there 's no big there there . ''
Asked by the inspector general about this text , Strzok said he was merely questioning whether collusion was coordinated or just involved “ a bunch of opportunists . ”
Strzok ultimately joined the team investigating Trump , before being removed and then fired , after the IG report revealed his texts .
FBI lawyer suggests a small team interview Clinton because ‘ she might be our next president ’
In February 2016 , while Hillary Clinton was under investigation for improper handling of classified information , the Department of Justice wanted to send four attorneys to question Clinton .
But FBI attorney Page urged both Strzok and then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe to only allow two DOJ people to be sent .
“ Our best reason to hold the line at 2 and 2 is : She might be our next president , ” Page explained to McCabe via text . “ The last thing we need is us going in there loaded for bear , when it is not operationally necessary ... This is as much about reputational protection as anything . ”
The inspector general ’ s office asked Page about that and reported that she told them “ while ‘ it ’ s irrelevant whether or not [ Clinton ] ... would or would not become president ... if she did become president , I don ’ t want her left with a feeling that ... the FBI marched in with an army of 50 in order to interview me . ’ ”
Page and others did not appear to express similar concern about Trump ’ s feelings once his turn for investigation came .
Ultimately , all four DOJ prosecutors were allowed to interview Clinton , who brought nine of her own lawyers to the interview .
The inspector general also found several pro-Clinton texts that other FBI employees sent from work phones , from “ I ’ m with her , ” to quips about being “ done interviewing the President ” -- even though Clinton had not won the election yet .
McCabe compares Trump to ‘ Mafia ’ for asking if he should give speech to FBI
McCabe , in his book and in press summaries , said that Trump asked him whether he should give a speech to FBI agents after James Comey had been fired as FBI director and when McCabe was filling in for him .

He can be reached on Twitter at @ MaximLott .","The conclusion of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation – and its determination that no evidence supports claims of Trump-Russia collusion – has spurred calls from President Trump’s allies to closely examine the probe’s origins at the FBI.

Trump, for his part, called to “look into” those who had created a “false narrative” sparking the investigation. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has already vowed to look into the FBI’s actions.

READ THE SUMMARY OF THE MUELLER REPORT

They’ll have plenty to sift through.

Here are just seven FBI actions and comments, covered in controversial text messages, that have raised questions about the impartiality of the probe.

FBI lead investigator texts ‘we’ll stop’ Trump

On Aug. 8, 2016, FBI lawyer Lisa Page texted her lover, Peter Strzok, who was in charge of the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton and later worked on the Russia probe: ""[Trump's] not ever going to become president, right? Right?!""

Strzok responded on his FBI-issued work phone: ""No. No he won't. We'll stop it.""

The text was discovered by the inspector general at the U.S. Department of Justice, after the FBI failed to uncover the message on its own.

The IG report was scathing about Strzok’s text.

“It is not only indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate’s electoral prospects,” the IG report stated.

The inspector general’s office also asked Strzok for his response.

TRUMP BLASTS MEDIA AFTER MUELLER REPORT

“When asked about this text message, Strzok stated that he did not specifically recall sending it, but that he believed that it was intended to reassure Page that Trump would not be elected, not to suggest that he would do something to impact the investigation,” the report notes.

Strzok later told the House Judiciary Committee that he meant Americans in general would stop Trump in 2016.

Strzok calls Russia investigation an ‘insurance policy’ in case Trump wins

In an Aug. 15, 2016 text message, Strzok told Page: ""I want to believe ... that there's no way Trump gets elected—but I'm afraid we can't take that risk. It's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you're 40.""

Critics say the text implies Strzok wanted the investigation to hurt Trump in case he were to win.

Strzok told the IG and the House Judiciary Committee that his text meant an investigation should happen right away.

“My use of the phrase ‘insurance policy’ was simply to say, while the polls or people might think it is less likely that then-candidate Trump would be elected, that should not influence ... us doing our job responsibly,” Strzok told the House Judiciary Committee.

Strzok admits in 2017 ‘there's no big there there’ on Russian collusion

Despite having called the Russia situation an “insurance policy” and having pressed for more vigorous investigation, a text from May 17, 2017 shows Strzok had doubts.

In texts to Page, Strzok questioned whether he should join Mueller’s team investigating Trump and Russia because: ""you and I both know the odds are nothing. If I thought it was likely I'd be there no question. I hesitate in part because of my gut sense and concern there's no big there there.""

Asked by the inspector general about this text, Strzok said he was merely questioning whether collusion was coordinated or just involved “a bunch of opportunists.”

Strzok ultimately joined the team investigating Trump, before being removed and then fired, after the IG report revealed his texts.

FBI lawyer suggests a small team interview Clinton because ‘she might be our next president’

In February 2016, while Hillary Clinton was under investigation for improper handling of classified information, the Department of Justice wanted to send four attorneys to question Clinton.

But FBI attorney Page urged both Strzok and then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe to only allow two DOJ people to be sent.

“Our best reason to hold the line at 2 and 2 is: She might be our next president,” Page explained to McCabe via text. “The last thing we need is us going in there loaded for bear, when it is not operationally necessary... This is as much about reputational protection as anything.”

The inspector general’s office asked Page about that and reported that she told them “while ‘it’s irrelevant whether or not [Clinton]...would or would not become president...if she did become president, I don’t want her left with a feeling that...the FBI marched in with an army of 50 in order to interview me.’”

Page and others did not appear to express similar concern about Trump’s feelings once his turn for investigation came.

Ultimately, all four DOJ prosecutors were allowed to interview Clinton, who brought nine of her own lawyers to the interview.

The inspector general also found several pro-Clinton texts that other FBI employees sent from work phones, from “I’m with her,” to quips about being “done interviewing the President” -- even though Clinton had not won the election yet.

McCabe compares Trump to ‘Mafia’ for asking if he should give speech to FBI

McCabe, in his book and in press summaries, said that Trump asked him whether he should give a speech to FBI agents after James Comey had been fired as FBI director and when McCabe was filling in for him.

Trump asked both McCabe and his chief counsel Don McGahn if such a speech would be helpful.

While McCabe says he told Trump such a speech would be fine, he later wrote that Trump’s question really reminded him of ""a case involving the Russian Mafia, when I sent a man I’ll call Big Felix in to meet with a Mafia boss... The same kind of thing was happening here.""

“The president and his men were trying to work me the way a criminal brigade would operate,” McCabe added.

FBI employee cries when Trump won

The inspector general report found an exchange between FBI employees on their work phones from Nov. 9, just after the election.

“I can’t stop crying,” one unidentified FBI employee said.

“That makes me even more sad... I can’t stop stressing about what I could have done differently,” an unidentified FBI attorney replied.

FBI employee calls Trump supporters ‘all poor to middle class,’ ‘lazy POS’

The same FBI employee who discussed crying after the election also used an FBI-issued device to direct class-based disdain toward Trump supporters: “Trump’s supporters are all poor to middle class, uneducated, lazy POS that think he will magically grant them jobs for doing nothing.”

Peter Strzok used similar language, saying in one text: “Just went to a southern Virginia Walmart. I could SMELL the Trump support....”

`` He 's right , I was wrong , '' Comey said about how the FBI used the FISA process , adding , `` I was overconfident as director in our procedures , '' and that what happened `` was not acceptable . ''
Horowitz did make it clear that he believes the FBI ’ s investigation of Russian election interference and possible connections with the Trump campaign was properly initiated , but he did note that this is based on a “ low threshold. ” He also concluded that there was no testimonial or documentary evidence to show that the investigation started due to any political bias , but said the issue of bias “ gets murkier ” when it comes to the various issues with the FISA process .
That process included the reliance on information gathered by former British spy Christopher Steele as part of opposition research conducted by Fusion GPS for the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign . Horowitz ’ s report stated that government attorneys were hesitant to approve a FISA warrant application until they relied on unverified information from Steele . That information also was used in subsequent renewals for the FISA warrant .
Comey downplayed the role of Steele 's information in obtaining the FISA warrant against Page , claiming Sunday that it was `` not a huge part of the presentation to the court , '' just part of the information included in the warrant application .
He insisted that he and Horowitz `` were n't saying different things '' about Steele 's significance , but host Chris Wallace then read Horowitz 's words , which said Steele 's information `` played a central and essential role '' in establishing probable cause .
Comey said he did not `` see the disconnect '' between his stance and Horowitz 's , even though he recognized that Steele 's reporting `` was the one that convinced the lawyers '' to move forward .
When Wallace accused him of minimizing the relevance of Steele 's information , Comey said , `` if I was then I 'm sorry that I did that . ''
Another tense exchange occurred when Comey and Wallace accused each other of `` mischaracterizing '' the problems with Steele 's reporting . Comey claimed that the issue `` were significant questions about the reliability of some of the sub-source reporting . ''
Wallace then pointed out that according to Horowitz 's report , Steele 's Russian sub-source was not the problem . Rather , the sub-source told the FBI that Steele was the one misrepresenting his statements , demonstrating a lack of reliability .
Comey maintained `` that does n't drive the conclusion that Steele 's reporting was bunk . ''
In addition to the issues related to Steele , the FBI was found to have omitted exculpatory information about Page that could have impacted the judge ’ s decision in granting the FISA warrant . Included in this was an instance where an attorney was found to have altered an email to say that Page had not been a CIA source , when in fact he had been working with them . That information would have justified Page ’ s contacts with Russia , and its omission ultimately led to the FBI renewing the FISA warrant against Page .
In an April 2018 interview with MSNBC ’ s Rachel Maddow , Comey claimed that the FISA process is “ incredibly rigorous ” and claimed that Republicans ’ criticism of the Page FISA warrant was “ a political deal ” that was not “ based in substance or law . ”
Following the report ’ s release , Comey essentially claimed vindication , declaring in the wake of the report that the criticism of the bureau 's actions `` was all lies. ” When asked about vindication at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing , the inspector general bluntly replied , `` I think the activities we found here don ’ t vindicate anybody who touched this FISA . ''
Comey explained that his claim of vindication was not in reference to the issues identified in Horowtiz 's report .
“ What I mean is that the FBI was accused of treason , of illegal spying , of tapping Mr. Trump ’ s wires illegally , of opening an investigation without justification , of being a criminal conspiracy to unseat , defeat and then unseat a president . All of that was nonsense , '' he said .
On Sunday , Comey claimed that the FBI did not intentionally commit wrongdoing , but described the FBI 's failures as `` real sloppiness . '' He said the Horowitz report `` did not find misconduct by any FBI people , '' rather just `` mistakes and negligence . ''

LOOKING FOR ‘EXACT WORDS’

U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Moscow tried to sway the November vote in Trump’s favor. Russia has denied involvement, and Trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and Russia.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an interview that he does not have any relationship with Flynn and only spoke briefly with Flynn when he sat next to him at a 2015 dinner for Russian TV network RT.

“I made my speech. Then we talked about some other stuff. And I got up and left,” Putin told NBC News’ “Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly” program. “That’s it. I didn’t even really talk to him. That’s the extent of my acquaintance with Mr. Flynn.”

fbi,Washington Times,2,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jun/2/william-barr-seeks-dossiers-influence-fbis-trump-r/,How much did the FBI rely on a discredited Trump-Russia dossier?,2019-06-02,Rowan Scarborough,"The public knows that the FBI relied extensively on the Democratic Party-financed dossier , whose list of anti-Trump allegations influenced the bureau ’ s overall attitude toward the candidate and eventual president .
Now , Attorney General William P. Barr has made it clear he wants to know more : Just how far did the discredited dossier take the FBI into the depths of a nearly three-year Trump investigation ?
“ What were the standards that were applied ? What was the evidence ? ” Mr. Barr told CBS News , adding that his focus is not on the rank-and-file but on senior FBI leaders .
Dossier writer Christopher Steele , a former British intelligence officer , was a trusted FBI paid informant before Trump-Russia . He pitched his dossier to the FBI in these terms : Donald Trump was a Russia spy , co-conspirator and financier of computer hacking . In other words , a traitor and a criminal .
“ Christopher Steele influenced their attitudes , ” Rep. Jim Jordan , Ohio Republican , told The ███ . “ Remember , they had a relationship with Steele . Steele was former MI6 . So Steele probably biased them in some way because they had worked with Steele previously . ”
Special counsel Robert Mueller ’ s report on an investigation that found no conspiracy effectively destroyed the dossier .
The dossier ’ s impact inside FBI headquarters is a topic of investigation by John Durham , the U.S. attorney for Connecticut . Mr. Barr has assigned him the special job of finding out how and why the FBI targeted the Trump campaign — which means a focus on the dossier .
“ These counterintelligence activities that were directed at the Trump campaign were not done in the normal course and not through the normal procedures , as far as I can tell , ” Mr. Barr said Friday .
The attorney general said he wants Mr. Durham to find out “ what was the predicate for it , ” “ was everyone operating in their proper lane ” and “ what was the evidence . ”
He belittled the FBI ’ s decision to place an informant on campaign volunteer George Papadopoulos . He referred to the operation as “ dangling a confidential informant in front of a peripheral player in the Trump campaign . ”
Mr. Barr said the investigation is not FBI-wide but is focused on “ a small group at the top . … And a lot of the people who were involved are no longer there . ”
Though he mentioned no names , it was a clear reference to former FBI Director James B. Comey , former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe , and former Assistant Director Peter Strzok , who started the Trump investigation .
One reason he appointed Mr. Durham , the attorney general said , is that the prosecutor has the power to compel former officials to testify . The Justice Department inspector general does not .
The dossier isn ’ t the official reason given for why the FBI started its Trump journey . But beginning in July 2016 , dossier material was widely circulated and landed at the FBI and Justice Department headquarters , the White House , Congress , the State Department and various news bureaus in Washington .
That summer and fall , the only person known to be making election conspiracy allegations to the FBI against Mr. Trump was Mr. Steele , an operative paid by the Hillary Clinton campaign .
This is known : The FBI used the Kremlin-sourced dossier to obtain at least four wiretaps on a former Trump campaign volunteer . Mr. Comey briefed President Obama and President-elect Trump on the dossier ’ s contents .
The FBI received continuous dossier updates from Mr. Steele and from Fusion GPS , Mrs. Clinton ’ s opposition research firm that handled Mr. Steele . The FBI recruited Mr. Steele to keep investigating Mr. Trump after the election even though it scored the former spy ’ s reliability as low . The FBI , among other agencies , attached the dossier to the intelligence community ’ s final verdict that Moscow hacked Democratic Party computers .
Mr. Jordan , one of a key group of Republicans who have pushed the FBI for answers , said the bureau knew , through a contact , that Mr. Steele was “ desperate ” to bring down Mr. Trump before it cited the dossier to obtain the first wiretap .
“ The guy they are getting the dossier from that they then use to get the warrant , he ’ s got an extreme bias against the president , ” Mr. Jordan said . “ So I think all that comes together , and you get what we now understand was this effort to go after the president . ”
⦁ July 31 , 2016 . Mr. Strzok kicked off the FBI ’ s investigation into Mr. Trump based on information from Australian Ambassador Alexander Downer in London . Mr. Downer said Trump volunteer Papadopoulos told him over a glass of wine that he had heard the Russians might have dirt on Mrs. Clinton .
By that time , Mr. Strzok likely possessed other information . FBI agent Michael J. Gaeta traveled to London from his Rome base on July 5 to meet Mr. Steele , who was eager to start funneling his Trump conspiracies to the Obama administration . The Obama State Department approved the session .
Mr. Steele began writing dossier memos the previous month after he was hired by Fusion . By July 5 , he had written at least one memo . It alleged that Mr. Trump was receiving intelligence on Mrs. Clinton from the Kremlin . In other words , a Trump-Russia conspiracy .
“ I have to report this to headquarters , ” Mr. Gaeta told Mr. Steele , according to the Michael Isikoff and David Corn book “ Russian Roulette . ”
That month , Mr. Steele would add memos alleging an “ extensive conspiracy ” between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin — a conspiracy Mr. Mueller didn ’ t find .
⦁ Oct. 21 , 2016 . The FBI executed its first wiretap on former Trump volunteer Carter Page . Mr. Comey signed the application to a judge on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) court . The application relied heavily on what Mr. Steele said about Mr . Page . The application stated at the top , “ Verified Application . ”
It also was signed by Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates , who , like Mr. Comey , eventually would become a vocal Trump critic .
Earlier in October , Mr. Gaeta had a second meeting with Mr. Steele , this time in Rome . By then , Mr. Steele had tapped Kremlin sources for a whole new array of conspiracy charges that eventually would be proved false . Four FBI officials from Washington headquarters joined Mr. Gaeta . At that meeting , the FBI offered Mr. Steele $ 50,000 to keep investigating Mr. Trump .
“ I was coming forward because it was my duty , ” Mr. Steele is quoted in “ Russian Roulette ” as saying . “ You think if I was peddling false information about Russia , I ’ d still be in business ? ”
The record shows that before the investigation opened July 31 and before the Carter Page wiretap , FBI headquarters was awash in the dossier ’ s anti-Trump allegations .
⦁ May 2017 . In response to Mr. Trump ’ s firing of Mr. Comey , Mr. McCabe opened an investigation into whether the president was a Russian agent .
Mr. Steele ’ s allegations had been made public by then : BuzzFeed posted the entire 17 memos on Jan. 10 .
Before the election , Mr. McCabe received a special briefing from Bruce Ohr , at that time the Justice Department ’ s No . 4 official . Mr. Ohr ’ s wife worked at Fusion GPS , which was investigating Mr. Trump . Mr. Ohr turned over to the FBI two thumb drives filled with Fusion research .
⦁ May 2017 . Mr. Comey had written for-the-record memos recounting his private meetings with Mr. Trump . He believed Mr. Trump was meddling in FBI investigations .
Upon being ousted from the FBI , Mr. Comey leaked the memos to The New York Times via a Columbia University professor and former federal prosecutor . Mr. Comey said he did so to prompt the appointment of a special prosecutor , which happened when Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein named Mr. Mueller .
Three G-men — Mr. Strzok , Mr. McCabe and Mr. Comey — made momentous decisions at a time when Mr. Steele ’ s dozen or so conspiracy allegations had circulated on the FBI ’ s seventh-floor headquarters .
Said Mr. Barr : “ The activities were undertaken by a small group at the top , which is probably one of the mistakes that has been made , instead of running this as a normal bureau investigation or counterintelligence investigation . ”
A public record of two FBI memoirs and various congressional transcripts can determine Mr. Steele ’ s effect .
One place researchers will not find answers is Mr. Mueller ’ s 448-page report , which mentions the dossier and Mr. Steele only in passing .
There is little known publicly about how the dossier influenced Mr. Strzok , who opened and directed the counterintelligence investigation into Trump associates .
During Mr. Strzok ’ s congressional appearance in July 2018 , Mr. Jordan repeatedly asked how he gathered dossier material .

Mr. Strzok wasn ’ t asked about Mr. Gaeta ’ s July meeting with Mr. Steele in London and how dossier information reached headquarters .

Mr. Ohr spread Mr. Steele ’ s allegations even further that summer inside the Obama administration . He met with three lawyers in the Justice Department ’ s criminal division , including Andrew Weissmann . Mr. Mueller later tapped Mr. Weissmann as one of his top prosecutors .
Mr. Ohr talked with Mr. Steele continually and met with the FBI 13 times in 2016 and 2017 .
In public statements , the former FBI director has kept an arm ’ s distance from the dossier , even as he used it to brief Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump .
He said during his spring 2018 book tour that he still didn ’ t know who funded the dossier .
This was after Democratic Party attorneys acknowledged publicly that the party and the Clinton campaign had funded it .
In a December 2018 closed-door congressional hearing , for which a transcript was later released , Mr. Comey testified to a different timeline . He said he learned that the Democrats funded the project before he signed the first wiretap application on Mr . Page on Oct. 21 , 2016 .
He said he didn ’ t know that the dossier was cited as evidence on the application .
Rep. John Ratcliffe , Texas Republican , asked Mr. Comey , “ Do you know whether the application that you signed states that the FBI has reviewed this verified application for accuracy ? ”
“ I don ’ t remember that specifically , ” Mr. Comey said . “ It sounds like the kind of thing that would be in there as a matter of course , but I don ’ t remember . ”
Mr. Ratcliffe quoted the FBI ’ s counterintelligence chief as saying the dossier had not been verified .
“ Does that cause you any concern about the fact that you signed a verified application for a warrant to surveil Carter Page when the Steele dossier was only minimally corroborated or in its infancy in its corroboration ? ” Mr. Ratliff asked .
“ I don ’ t know enough or remember enough two years later to have a reaction . I don ’ t know their testimony . I haven ’ t looked at the thing , ” Mr. Comey replied .
At the time Mr. Comey was fired in May 2017 , the FBI was still trying to verify Mr. Steele ’ s charges .
“ My understanding is that an effort was underway to try to replicate , either rule in or rule out , as much of that collection of reports that ’ s commonly now called the Steele dossier as possible , and that that work was ongoing when I was fired , ” Mr. Comey testified .
According to declassified FISA applications released under pressure by Rep. Devin Nunes , California Republican , the FBI cited a Yahoo News story as corroboration . But the Yahoo story and the dossier came from the same source : Mr. Steele .
The FBI told the judge that Mr. Steele had affirmed he hadn ’ t spoken to reporters , thus making the Yahoo piece an independent source . But he had briefed the Yahoo story author .
Republican senators have asked the Justice Department to investigate Mr. Steele for lying to the FBI .
Mr. Barr wants Mr. Durham , the special investigator , to look into all of this .
The attorney general said he arrived at Justice with questions for which he expected answers . So far , he said , the facts don ’ t add up .
“ I had a lot of questions about what was going on , ” he said . “ I assumed I ’ d get answers when I went in , and I have not gotten answers that are , well , satisfactory , and in fact probably have more questions , and that some of the facts that I ’ ve learned don ’ t hang together with the official explanations of what happened . ”
He didn ’ t single out any particular agency . The FBI has fought congressional Republicans over access to a number of documents .
“ The fact that today people just seem to brush aside the idea that it is OK to , you know , to engage in these activities against a political campaign is stunning to me , especially when the media doesn ’ t seem to think that it ’ s worth looking into , ” Mr. Barr said . “ They ’ re supposed to be the watchdogs of , you know , our civil liberties . ”
After the broadcast , Mr. Comey tweeted , “ Bill Barr on CBS offers no facts . An AG should not be echoing conspiracy theories . He should gather facts and show them . That is what Justice is about . ”","The public knows that the FBI relied extensively on the Democratic Party-financed dossier, whose list of anti-Trump allegations influenced the bureau’s overall attitude toward the candidate and eventual president.

Now, Attorney General William P. Barr has made it clear he wants to know more: Just how far did the discredited dossier take the FBI into the depths of a nearly three-year Trump investigation?

“What were the standards that were applied? What was the evidence?” Mr. Barr told CBS News, adding that his focus is not on the rank-and-file but on senior FBI leaders.

Dossier writer Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer, was a trusted FBI paid informant before Trump-Russia. He pitched his dossier to the FBI in these terms: Donald Trump was a Russia spy, co-conspirator and financier of computer hacking. In other words, a traitor and a criminal.

“Christopher Steele influenced their attitudes,” Rep. Jim Jordan, Ohio Republican, told The Washington Times. “Remember, they had a relationship with Steele. Steele was former MI6. So Steele probably biased them in some way because they had worked with Steele previously.”

Special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on an investigation that found no conspiracy effectively destroyed the dossier.

The dossier’s impact inside FBI headquarters is a topic of investigation by John Durham, the U.S. attorney for Connecticut. Mr. Barr has assigned him the special job of finding out how and why the FBI targeted the Trump campaign — which means a focus on the dossier.

“These counterintelligence activities that were directed at the Trump campaign were not done in the normal course and not through the normal procedures, as far as I can tell,” Mr. Barr said Friday.

The attorney general said he wants Mr. Durham to find out “what was the predicate for it,” “was everyone operating in their proper lane” and “what was the evidence.”

He belittled the FBI’s decision to place an informant on campaign volunteer George Papadopoulos. He referred to the operation as “dangling a confidential informant in front of a peripheral player in the Trump campaign.”

Mr. Barr said the investigation is not FBI-wide but is focused on “a small group at the top. … And a lot of the people who were involved are no longer there.”

Though he mentioned no names, it was a clear reference to former FBI Director James B. Comey, former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, and former Assistant Director Peter Strzok, who started the Trump investigation.

One reason he appointed Mr. Durham, the attorney general said, is that the prosecutor has the power to compel former officials to testify. The Justice Department inspector general does not.

The dossier isn’t the official reason given for why the FBI started its Trump journey. But beginning in July 2016, dossier material was widely circulated and landed at the FBI and Justice Department headquarters, the White House, Congress, the State Department and various news bureaus in Washington.

That summer and fall, the only person known to be making election conspiracy allegations to the FBI against Mr. Trump was Mr. Steele, an operative paid by the Hillary Clinton campaign.

This is known: The FBI used the Kremlin-sourced dossier to obtain at least four wiretaps on a former Trump campaign volunteer. Mr. Comey briefed President Obama and President-elect Trump on the dossier’s contents.

The FBI and the dossier

The FBI received continuous dossier updates from Mr. Steele and from Fusion GPS, Mrs. Clinton’s opposition research firm that handled Mr. Steele. The FBI recruited Mr. Steele to keep investigating Mr. Trump after the election even though it scored the former spy’s reliability as low. The FBI, among other agencies, attached the dossier to the intelligence community’s final verdict that Moscow hacked Democratic Party computers.

Mr. Jordan, one of a key group of Republicans who have pushed the FBI for answers, said the bureau knew, through a contact, that Mr. Steele was “desperate” to bring down Mr. Trump before it cited the dossier to obtain the first wiretap.

“The guy they are getting the dossier from that they then use to get the warrant, he’s got an extreme bias against the president,” Mr. Jordan said. “So I think all that comes together, and you get what we now understand was this effort to go after the president.”

The four key points in the FBI’s timeline:

⦁ July 31, 2016. Mr. Strzok kicked off the FBI’s investigation into Mr. Trump based on information from Australian Ambassador Alexander Downer in London. Mr. Downer said Trump volunteer Papadopoulos told him over a glass of wine that he had heard the Russians might have dirt on Mrs. Clinton.

By that time, Mr. Strzok likely possessed other information. FBI agent Michael J. Gaeta traveled to London from his Rome base on July 5 to meet Mr. Steele, who was eager to start funneling his Trump conspiracies to the Obama administration. The Obama State Department approved the session.

Mr. Steele began writing dossier memos the previous month after he was hired by Fusion. By July 5, he had written at least one memo. It alleged that Mr. Trump was receiving intelligence on Mrs. Clinton from the Kremlin. In other words, a Trump-Russia conspiracy.

“I have to report this to headquarters,” Mr. Gaeta told Mr. Steele, according to the Michael Isikoff and David Corn book “Russian Roulette.”

That month, Mr. Steele would add memos alleging an “extensive conspiracy” between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin — a conspiracy Mr. Mueller didn’t find.

⦁ Oct. 21, 2016. The FBI executed its first wiretap on former Trump volunteer Carter Page. Mr. Comey signed the application to a judge on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court. The application relied heavily on what Mr. Steele said about Mr. Page. The application stated at the top, “Verified Application.”

It also was signed by Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates, who, like Mr. Comey, eventually would become a vocal Trump critic.

Earlier in October, Mr. Gaeta had a second meeting with Mr. Steele, this time in Rome. By then, Mr. Steele had tapped Kremlin sources for a whole new array of conspiracy charges that eventually would be proved false. Four FBI officials from Washington headquarters joined Mr. Gaeta. At that meeting, the FBI offered Mr. Steele $50,000 to keep investigating Mr. Trump.

“I was coming forward because it was my duty,” Mr. Steele is quoted in “Russian Roulette” as saying. “You think if I was peddling false information about Russia, I’d still be in business?”

The record shows that before the investigation opened July 31 and before the Carter Page wiretap, FBI headquarters was awash in the dossier’s anti-Trump allegations.

⦁ May 2017. In response to Mr. Trump’s firing of Mr. Comey, Mr. McCabe opened an investigation into whether the president was a Russian agent.

Mr. Steele’s allegations had been made public by then: BuzzFeed posted the entire 17 memos on Jan. 10.

Before the election, Mr. McCabe received a special briefing from Bruce Ohr, at that time the Justice Department’s No. 4 official. Mr. Ohr’s wife worked at Fusion GPS, which was investigating Mr. Trump. Mr. Ohr turned over to the FBI two thumb drives filled with Fusion research.

⦁ May 2017. Mr. Comey had written for-the-record memos recounting his private meetings with Mr. Trump. He believed Mr. Trump was meddling in FBI investigations.

Upon being ousted from the FBI, Mr. Comey leaked the memos to The New York Times via a Columbia University professor and former federal prosecutor. Mr. Comey said he did so to prompt the appointment of a special prosecutor, which happened when Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein named Mr. Mueller.

Three G-men — Mr. Strzok, Mr. McCabe and Mr. Comey — made momentous decisions at a time when Mr. Steele’s dozen or so conspiracy allegations had circulated on the FBI’s seventh-floor headquarters.

Said Mr. Barr: “The activities were undertaken by a small group at the top, which is probably one of the mistakes that has been made, instead of running this as a normal bureau investigation or counterintelligence investigation.”

A public record of two FBI memoirs and various congressional transcripts can determine Mr. Steele’s effect.

One place researchers will not find answers is Mr. Mueller’s 448-page report, which mentions the dossier and Mr. Steele only in passing.

Peter Strzok

There is little known publicly about how the dossier influenced Mr. Strzok, who opened and directed the counterintelligence investigation into Trump associates.

During Mr. Strzok’s congressional appearance in July 2018, Mr. Jordan repeatedly asked how he gathered dossier material.

“Based on direction by the FBI, sir, I am not able to answer questions about ongoing investigative matters,” Mr. Strzok testified. “I have been directed that I may state that I have read the dossier, that I read the dossier as it came in in parts and pieces to the FBI.”

Mr. Strzok wasn’t asked about Mr. Gaeta’s July meeting with Mr. Steele in London and how dossier information reached headquarters.

In a previous, more extensive closed-door session, Mr. Jordan tried to elicit dossier facts, such as the first time Mr. Strzok saw Mr. Steele’s material. In other words, was it before July 31?

“Again, that gets into a level of investigative detail about an ongoing investigation that I don’t think the FBI or the special counsel want me to answer,” Mr. Strzok answered. “I am happy to answer it, but I defer to what I think the appropriate FBI equities are in this regard.”

Mr. Strzok is famous for the series of salty text messages he exchanged with his lover, Lisa Page, who was legal counsel to Mr. McCabe.

Days after opening the Trump investigation, Ms. Page stated, “[Mr. Trump‘s] not ever going to become president, right? Right?!”

Mr. Strzok responded, “No. No he’s not. We’ll stop it.”

Days before the first Carter Page wiretap began, Mr. Strzok texted, “I am riled up. Trump is a f–ing idiot, is unable to provide a coherent answer.”

Said Mr. Barr: “It’s hard to read some of the texts … and not feel that there was gross bias at work and they’re appalling.”

The FBI fired Mr. Strzok.

Andrew McCabe

Mr. McCabe’s memoir, “The Threat,” had the promise of adding to the Christopher Steele saga. It didn’t.

Mr. McCabe, who played a role in shepherding the dossier material to Mr. Strzok, never brings up the dossier or discusses Mr. Steele. Mr. Ohr, Mr. McCabe’s link to Fusion GPS, also is never mentioned.

How the dossier affected his decision to put the president under investigation as a suspected foreign agent isn’t known publicly.

On his book tour, Mr. McCabe suggested that Mr. Trump was an agent for Russia.

The Mueller report contains no information that Mr. Trump was a Kremlin informant, as Mr. Steele alleged.

Mr. McCabe testified in private before a task force of the House Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform committees. The dossier came up once.

Mr. Ohr testified that he met with Mr. Steele on July 30, 2016, in Washington to hear his allegations. Mr. Ohr briefed Mr. McCabe at FBI headquarters a few days later. Mr. McCabe connected him with Mr. Strzok.

Mr. Ohr spread Mr. Steele’s allegations even further that summer inside the Obama administration. He met with three lawyers in the Justice Department’s criminal division, including Andrew Weissmann. Mr. Mueller later tapped Mr. Weissmann as one of his top prosecutors.

Mr. Ohr talked with Mr. Steele continually and met with the FBI 13 times in 2016 and 2017.

James Comey

In public statements, the former FBI director has kept an arm’s distance from the dossier, even as he used it to brief Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump.

He said during his spring 2018 book tour that he still didn’t know who funded the dossier.

This was after Democratic Party attorneys acknowledged publicly that the party and the Clinton campaign had funded it.

“Does that cause you any concern about the fact that you signed a verified application for a warrant to surveil Carter Page when the Steele dossier was only minimally corroborated or in its infancy in its corroboration?” Mr. Ratliff asked.

“I don’t know enough or remember enough two years later to have a reaction. I don’t know their testimony. I haven’t looked at the thing,” Mr. Comey replied.

Police: Durst is connected to missing Vermont college student

Author: Durst's path is tough to follow

Investigators looking at other cases across the country have their work cut out for them, Birkbeck said.

Rep. John Ratcliffe is President Trump's choice to become the next top leader of the U.S. intelligence community.

The Texas Republican thanked Trump on Twitter following the president's earlier announcement, also on Twitter, that Ratcliffe is his nominee to replace outgoing Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats.

Coats and Trump haven't been simpatico from the beginning, and the White House has been telling journalists for weeks that the president wants somebody else.

If the transition isn't a surprise, however, the choice of Ratcliffe might be — and some key senators have yet to state one way or another how they feel about the nominee.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., didn't mention Ratcliffe in a statement on Sunday that praised Coats but that also emphasized what McConnell called the need for a president to get candid advice.

""The U.S. intelligence community works best when it is led by professionals who protect its work from political or analytical bias and who deliver unvarnished hard truths to political leaders in both the executive and legislative branches,"" McConnell said. ""Very often the news these briefings bring is unpleasant, but it is essential that we be confronted with the facts.""

One question raised by McConnell's statement: Would Ratcliffe be so much of a loyalist that he would tell Trump only what he wanted to hear — and Congress and the public what Trump wanted them to hear? Or could he be the honest manager that the Senate majority leader says is needed?

Republicans control the Senate and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, which would consider Ratcliffe's nomination before the full body voted to confirm him.

That's if Trump formally submits the congressman's name.

In the past, Trump has sometimes said he intends to nominate someone for a post but then has never actually transmitted the person's name to the Senate.

That's what happened, for example, when Trump nominated economics commentator Stephen Moore and former pizza magnate Herman Cain to the board of the Federal Reserve. Ultimately, senators were spared the need to actually assess or cast votes on them.

North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, said in a statement Monday that he spoke with Ratcliffe over the weekend ""to congratulate him"" on the nomination.

Continued Burr: ""When the White House submits its official nomination to the Senate intelligence committee, we will work to move it swiftly through regular order.""

Other members of the panel have so far been silent on Ratcliffe's nomination.

Coats, a long-serving former member of Congress, was well known to many lawmakers and was confirmed in early 2017 by a vote of 85 to 12. At the same time, the Senate has considered and endorsed a close-call nominee of Trump's before — CIA Director Gina Haspel.

She was controversial because of her role in President George W. Bush's terrorist interrogation program, but she also was a career officer with deep experience inside the agency.

Ratcliffe sits today on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence but had little intelligence or foreign affairs experience before that, as some commentators observed after Trump's announcement.

Democrats faulted what they called Trump's bid to fill an important role with what they called a flunky and another ""television character.""

Trump vs. the spooks

Trump, Coats and the leaders of the intelligence community have endured uncomfortable stretches for as long as Trump has been in office.

The spy bosses assessed that North Korea is unlikely to surrender its nuclear weapons, for example, even though Trump has made much of his personal rapport with the country's leader, Kim Jong Un.

The leaders of the intelligence and national defense establishment told Congress that Iran was abiding by its commitments under the nuclear deal, but Trump sought to abrogate it and went ahead with withdrawing the United States.

And Coats and the other leaders of the intelligence community also continued their focus on foreign election interference in parallel with the investigation by then-special counsel Robert Mueller into Russia's attack on the 2016 election.

Trump goes back and forth as to what he accepts about foreign interference generally and Russia's role specifically in the 2016 election.

Agency leaders reportedly have been told, however, not to mention the topic to Trump and to keep their discussions of it ""below his level.""

WASHINGTON — Top Clinton campaign officials urged FBI Director James Comey on Sunday to provide more details about the bureau's review of newly-discovered emails related to the investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private server, charging that his ""inappropriate"" letter announcing the review Friday is fueling conspiracy theories that could hurt the Democratic nominee just days before the election.

Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, appearing on CNN's State of the Union with Jake Tapper, called the letter released by Comey on Friday ""long on innuendo, short on facts,"" noting that Comey could not even say if the emails contained significant information. Comey appeared to be breaking with precedent by disclosing information about an ongoing investigation before determining if the newly-discovered emails provide any new insights, Podesta said.

""If they're not significant, they're not significant,"" said Podesta, who called Comey's action ""inappropriate."" He added that Comey ""should have read them first"" before making a bombshell announcement about the emails just 11 days before the election.

""This is something that has been tossed into the middle of the campaign,"" Podesta said. We would have preferred that that not happen, but now that it has happened, we would prefer that Mr. Comey come forward and explain why he took that unprecedented step.""

Attorney General Loretta Lynch objected to Comey's decision to announce the probe, according to Justice Department sources, because she felt it violated department policy to not takes step that may interfere with an election.

Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they ’ re published .
A study published this week casts doubt on the reliability of a technique the FBI Laboratory has used for decades to identify criminals by purporting to match their bluejeans with those photographed in surveillance images , potentially undermining evidence used to win numerous convictions .
The FBI ’ s method , used principally in bank robbery cases , matches denim pants by the light and dark patches along their seams , called wear marks . An FBI examiner ’ s scientific journal article on bluejeans identification in 1999 argued that wear marks create , effectively , a barcode that is unique on every pair . That article provided a legal foundation for the FBI to use an array of similar techniques to assert matches for clothes , vehicles , human faces and skin features .
Get Our Top Investigations Subscribe to the Big Story newsletter .
After a ███ investigation raised questions about the technique , Hany Farid , a University of California , Berkeley , computer science professor and leading forensic image analyst , and Sophie Nightingale , a postdoctoral researcher in image science , tested the bureau ’ s method and found several serious flaws . Their study , published this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , is the first known independent research on the technique ’ s reliability , even though the courts have allowed bluejeans identifications as trial evidence for years .
The new study determined that seams on different pairs of bluejeans are often highly similar . Separately , multiple pictures of the same pant seam , taken under varying conditions , can appear starkly different from one another .
Taken together , the authors write , these deficiencies show “ identification based on denim jeans should be used with extreme caution , if at all . ”
In its articles last year , ███ revealed that FBI examiners have tied defendants to crimes in thousands of cases over the past half-century by using crime-scene pictures in unproven ways and , at times , have given jurors baseless statistics to say the risk of errors in their analyses was extremely low . In several cases , the FBI ’ s most prominent image examiner contradicted the original conclusions and results in his lab reports when presenting evidence to criminal courts , FBI records and legal filings show .
The FBI ’ s issues with image analysis echo earlier controversies over other forensic techniques .

A study published this week casts doubt on the reliability of a technique the FBI Laboratory has used for decades to identify criminals by purporting to match their bluejeans with those photographed in surveillance images, potentially undermining evidence used to win numerous convictions.

The FBI’s method, used principally in bank robbery cases, matches denim pants by the light and dark patches along their seams, called wear marks. An FBI examiner’s scientific journal article on bluejeans identification in 1999 argued that wear marks create, effectively, a barcode that is unique on every pair. That article provided a legal foundation for the FBI to use an array of similar techniques to assert matches for clothes, vehicles, human faces and skin features.

After a ProPublica investigation raised questions about the technique, Hany Farid, a University of California, Berkeley, computer science professor and leading forensic image analyst, and Sophie Nightingale, a postdoctoral researcher in image science, tested the bureau’s method and found several serious flaws. Their study, published this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is the first known independent research on the technique’s reliability, even though the courts have allowed bluejeans identifications as trial evidence for years.

The new study determined that seams on different pairs of bluejeans are often highly similar. Separately, multiple pictures of the same pant seam, taken under varying conditions, can appear starkly different from one another.

Taken together, the authors write, these deficiencies show “identification based on denim jeans should be used with extreme caution, if at all.”

The FBI declined to comment on the study.

In its articles last year, ProPublica revealed that FBI examiners have tied defendants to crimes in thousands of cases over the past half-century by using crime-scene pictures in unproven ways and, at times, have given jurors baseless statistics to say the risk of errors in their analyses was extremely low. In several cases, the FBI’s most prominent image examiner contradicted the original conclusions and results in his lab reports when presenting evidence to criminal courts, FBI records and legal filings show.

The FBI’s issues with image analysis echo earlier controversies over other forensic techniques. The bureau’s lab technicians and scientists had long testified in court that they could determine what fingertip left a print and which scalp grew a hair “to the exclusion of all others.” Research and exonerations by DNA analysis have repeatedly disproved those claims, and the U.S. Department of Justice no longer permits its forensic scientists to make such unequivocal statements.

ProPublica found that examiners on the Forensic Audio, Video and Image Analysis Unit, based at the FBI Lab in Quantico, Virginia, continue to use similarly flawed methods and to testify to the precision of these methods, according to a review of court records and examiners’ written reports and published articles. At ProPublica’s request, several statisticians and forensic science experts reviewed the unit’s methods. The experts identified numerous instances of examiners overstating their techniques’ precision and said some of their assertions defied logic.

In response to ProPublica’s reporting, Nightingale and Farid said they decided to test the FBI’s photo comparison techniques, starting with bluejeans identification.

The authors were consistently able to mark the same features, suggesting the first step in the bureau’s process works as intended.

But then the analysis measured wear mark patterns and found the FBI Lab’s method struggled to match images of the same pant seam, which were frequently no more similar to one another than to seams from different pairs.

Nightingale and Farid hypothesize that denim jeans are too flexible, as the material easily stretches and shrinks, changing how wear marks appear, even moment to moment.

The technique failed to correctly match images of the same bluejeans in most cases unless they allowed for a high rate of false positives. When inaccurate matches were limited to one in 10,000, it identified less than 30% of the true matches.

Mccaskill, Louis Nelson, Nick Gass","FBI recommends no charges against Clinton in email probe But Comey scolds Clinton and her aides for 'extremely careless ' handling of highly classified information .
FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday announced the agency is not recommending the Justice Department bring charges against Hillary Clinton , while also denouncing the former secretary of state and her aides for the way they handled classified information through private email servers .
`` Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information , there is information that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive , highly classified information , '' Comey told reporters in Washington , D.C. , noting that the probe has found that the former secretary of state used several different email servers and numerous devices during her time in office .
Even so , Comey added later , “ Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information , our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case . Prosecutors necessarily weigh a number of factors before deciding whether to bring charges . ''
Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said the campaign was happy the FBI probe was now in the rearview mirror . `` We are pleased that the career officials handling this case have determined that no further action by the Department is appropriate , ” Fallon said in a statement on Tuesday afternoon . “ As the Secretary has long said , it was a mistake to use her personal email and she would not do it again . We are glad that this matter is now resolved . ''
While the FBI ’ s recommendation not to bring charges removes a significant hurdle in the way of Clinton and her presidential campaign , the presumptive Democratic nominee is likely to continue facing questions about her use of private email until November and beyond .
Comey ’ s decision to pepper his remarks with an array of judgmental language directed at Clinton and her aides provided plenty of fodder for Republicans eager to drive home with voters the former secretary of state ’ s trustworthiness problem .
Still , Republicans quickly denounced the decision by Comey , who was appointed to his current role by President Barack Obama in 2013 and had been appointed to his prior roles by George W. Bush .
“ The system is rigged . General Petraeus got in trouble for far less . Very very unfair ! As usual , bad judgment , ” Trump tweeted Tuesday morning , making reference to the disgraced former CIA director who resigned in the wake of an extramarital affair with his biographer with whom he had shared classified information .
Trump followed up with a statement in the afternoon , saying Comey offered up a detailed case on how Clinton “ compromised the safety of the American people . ”
“ Our adversaries almost certainly have a blackmail file on Hillary Clinton , and this fact alone disqualifies her from service , ” he said .
House Speaker Paul Ryan also tweeted his dismay , writing , “ While I respect the professionals at the FBI , this announcement defies explanation . No one should be above the law . ”
Comey , who did not take questions during the press conference , detailed specific findings from the FBI ’ s investigators , who interviewed Clinton just last Saturday morning for three-and-half hours .
Some of the findings contradicted statements from Clinton ’ s camp , which has long sought to downplay the seriousness of the probe and of the classified information on Clinton ’ s private server .
Of the 30,000 emails Clinton turned over to the State Department in 2014 , Comey announced that 110 emails in 52 separate chains had been determined to contain classified information “ at the time they were sent or received , ” contradicting Clinton ’ s claim that she neither sent nor received information that was deemed classified at the time . Of those , he continued , eight included “ Top Secret ” information , while 36 chains had “ Secret ” information at the time it was received , and eight contained “ Confidential ” information , the lowest level of classification .
“ None of these emails should have been on any kind of unclassified system , but their presence is especially concerning because all of these emails were housed on unclassified personal servers not even supported by full-time security staff , like those found at departments and agencies of the U.S. government — or even with a commercial service like Gmail , ” Comey said .
In addition to those emails , Comey continued , another 2,000 were “ up-classified ” to make them “ Confidential ” after they had already been sent .
“ But even if information is not marked ‘ classified ’ in an email , participants who know or should know that the subject matter is classified are still obligated to protect it , ” Comey said .
The FBI ’ s investigation is only the latest probe into one of the Clintons ’ alleged wrongdoings , following multiple investigations into Clinton ’ s response to the 2012 attacks in Benghazi , Libya , and an array of scandals that dogged President Bill Clinton during his time in the White House .
Clinton herself has lamented the lack of trust voters have indicated they have in her , from recent polls .
`` And I ’ ve thought a lot about what ’ s behind it , '' Clinton said June 27 at the International Women 's Luncheon in Chicago , the site of the 50th annual Rainbow PUSH Coalition Convention . `` And you know , you hear 25 years ’ worth of wild accusations , anyone would start to wonder . And it certainly is true — I ’ ve made mistakes . I don ’ t know anyone who hasn ’ t . So I understand people having questions . ''
But even the integrity of the FBI ’ s investigation was called into question when Bill Clinton had an impromptu meeting that same day with Attorney General Loretta Lynch . On Friday , Lynch said their meeting `` cast a shadow '' over the investigation and asserted that she `` certainly would n't do it again . '' She also added that she `` fully '' expects to accept the recommendations she receives from career prosecutors .
Comey on Tuesday emphasized that `` no outside influence of any kind was brought to bear . ''
Trump , however , said he did n't believe it . `` Bill Clinton didn ’ t accidentally run into the Attorney General on the airport tarmac last week in Phoenix , '' Trump said in his statement . `` Hillary Clinton didn ’ t accidentally sneak into the FBI during one of the country ’ s biggest holiday weekends to testify on her illegal activities , something that wouldn ’ t be afforded to others under investigation ( and on a Saturday of all days ) . It was no accident that charges were not recommended against Hillary the exact same day as President Obama campaigns with her for the first time . ''
Patrick Leahy , the highest-level Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee , said he takes Comey at his word that the FBI “ conducted an apolitical and professional investigation ” and hopes the Justice Department will take a similar approach .
“ I trust that the Department of Justice career prosecutors will consider the FBI ’ s recommendation and make a final decision based on facts , not politics , ” Leahy said in a statement .
Republicans , though , ripped into the FBI ’ s non-recommendation , with Ari Fleischer , the former press secretary for George W. Bush tweeting , “ Bottom line : Hillary is reckless , careless and has poor judgement , but she 's not a criminal . Which means she 's likely to be our next POTUS . ”
“ The FBI decision shows once again how the Clintons and others at the top get to live by a different set of rules from everyone else , ” tweeted Rep. Darrell Issa ( R-Calif. ) , the former chairman for the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee .
Bernie Sanders ’ campaign , meanwhile , said he still has no intention of imminently dropping out of the race , despite the FBI ’ s decision .
In prosecuting similar cases , Comey noted that past instances have `` involved some combination of clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information or vast quantities of information exposed in such a way as to support an inference of intentional misconduct or indications of disloyalty to the United States or efforts to obstruct justice . ''
`` We do not see those things here . To be clear , this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances , a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences . To the contrary , those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions , but that 's not what we 're deciding now , '' Comey added . “ As a result , although the Department of Justice makes final decisions on matters like this , we are expressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case . ''
Among those uncovered that were not produced to the State Department , Comey said that three of them were classified when they were sent or received , one at the Secret level and two at the Confidential Level .
“ I should add here that we found no evidence that any of the additional work-related emails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them , ” Comey explained . “ Our assessment is that , like many email users , Secretary Clinton periodically deleted emails or emails were purged from the system when devices were changed . Because she was not using a government account—or even a commercial account like Gmail—there was no archiving at all of her emails , so it is not surprising that we discovered emails that were not on Secretary Clinton ’ s system in 2014 , when she produced the 30,000 emails to the State Department . ”
Comey said investigators did not find “ direct evidence ” that Clinton ’ s personal email domain , in its various configurations since 2009 , had been compromised by hackers .
“ But , given the nature of the system and of the actors potentially involved , we assess that we would be unlikely to see such direct evidence , ” he added . “ We do assess that hostile actors gained access to the private commercial email accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in regular contact from her personal account . We also assess that Secretary Clinton ’ s use of a personal email domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent . She also used her personal email extensively while outside the United States , including sending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries . Given that combination of factors , we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton ’ s personal email account . ”
Anticipating the reaction to the recommendation , Comey said , `` I know there will be intense public debate in the wake of this recommendation as there was throughout the investigation . What I can assure the American people is that this investigation was done honestly , competently and independently . ''
`` I know there were many opinions expressed by people not part of the investigation , including people in government , but none of that mattered to us , '' he concluded . `` Opinions are irrelevant , and they were all uninformed by insight into our investigation because we did our investigation the right way . Only facts matter , and the FBI found them here in an entirely apolitical and professional way . I could n't be prouder to be part of this organization . ''
Comey prefaced the announcement by saying that he has not coordinated his statement with the Justice Department or any other government agency .
“ They do not know what I 'm about to say , ” Comey said , thanking the agents who worked on the case .
Campaign spokesman Nick Merrill told reporters in a statement Saturday that Clinton was `` pleased '' to help assist the Justice Department in wrapping up its investigation but said Clinton would n't offer any additional comments regarding the interview `` out of respect for the investigative process . ''
Clinton told MSNBC 's Chuck Todd in a phone interview Saturday that she was `` eager '' to meet with the FBI but had `` no knowledge '' of when the federal agency would conclude its investigation .

Attorney General Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Chris Wray officially received the letter yesterday :
Eleven House Republicans have sent a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Christopher Wray officially referring Hillary Clinton , fired FBI Director James Comey , fired Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch for criminal investigation . FBI agents Peter Strzok and Lisa Page , who were caught sending hundreds of anti-Trump text messages during the Clinton investigation , have also been referred for criminal investigation . U.S. Attorney John Huber , who was tapped by Sessions a few weeks ago to investigate the FBI 's handling of the Clinton email probe , was copied on the request .
Now , the nonpartisan , Obama-appointed Department of Justice Inspector General has sent his report to a federal prosecutor to see if Mr. McCabe should be charged with a crime . McCabe was torched in the IG report , where he was cited for lying under oath three times and misleading investigators concerning an unauthorized media disclosure to The Wall Street Journal over the Clinton Foundation ( via WaPo ) :
The Justice Department inspector general referred its finding that former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe repeatedly misled investigators who were examining a media disclosure to the top federal prosecutor in D.C. to determine whether McCabe should be charged with a crime , according to people familiar with the matter . The referral to the D.C. U.S. Attorney ’ s Office occurred some time ago , after the inspector general concluded McCabe had lied to investigators or his own boss , then-FBI Director James B. Comey , on four occasions , three of them under oath . It was not immediately clear how the D.C.

UPDATE : McCabe ’ s lawyer calls referral by nonpartisan Obama-appointed IG “ unjustified. ” He doesn ’ t expect charges to be filed against the former FBI deputy director : ( via AP ) :
A lawyer for fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe says a criminal referral to prosecutors about his client is “ unjustified. ” Attorney Michael Bromwich confirmed the referral to the U.S. Attorney ’ s Office in Washington in a statement Thursday . It comes amid an inspector general report that concluded that McCabe misled investigators about his role in a news media disclosure . The referral doesn ’ t mean he will be charged , but it does mean he could face a criminal investigation . In his statement , Bromwich says the standard for an inspector general referral “ is very low. ” He says he ’ s already met with representatives from the U.S. Attorney ’ s office and is confident that , “ unless there is inappropriate pressure from high levels of the Administration , the US Attorney ’ s Office will conclude that it should decline to prosecute . ”","Katie’s touched upon the GOP letter officially referring former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, former FBI Director James Comey, and Hillary Clinton for a criminal investigation. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Chris Wray officially received the letter yesterday:

Eleven House Republicans have sent a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Christopher Wray officially referring Hillary Clinton, fired FBI Director James Comey, fired Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch for criminal investigation. FBI agents Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who were caught sending hundreds of anti-Trump text messages during the Clinton investigation, have also been referred for criminal investigation. U.S. Attorney John Huber, who was tapped by Sessions a few weeks ago to investigate the FBI's handling of the Clinton email probe, was copied on the request.

Now, the nonpartisan, Obama-appointed Department of Justice Inspector General has sent his report to a federal prosecutor to see if Mr. McCabe should be charged with a crime. McCabe was torched in the IG report, where he was cited for lying under oath three times and misleading investigators concerning an unauthorized media disclosure to The Wall Street Journal over the Clinton Foundation (via WaPo):

The Justice Department inspector general referred its finding that former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe repeatedly misled investigators who were examining a media disclosure to the top federal prosecutor in D.C. to determine whether McCabe should be charged with a crime, according to people familiar with the matter. The referral to the D.C. U.S. Attorney’s Office occurred some time ago, after the inspector general concluded McCabe had lied to investigators or his own boss, then-FBI Director James B. Comey, on four occasions, three of them under oath. It was not immediately clear how the D.C. U.S. Attorney’s Office responded to the referral, or whether prosecutors there are conducting their own investigation or believe criminal charges are appropriate. A referral to federal prosecutors does not necessarily mean McCabe will be charged with a crime. The Justice Department, the D.C. U.S. Attorney’s Office and a spokeswoman for McCabe declined to comment Thursday. Last week, Inspector General Michael Horowitz sent to Congress a report blasting McCabe. It says he inappropriately authorized the disclosure of sensitive information to the media, then lied repeatedly to investigators examining the matter. The report — which quickly became public, though it was not released by the inspector general — laid out in stunning detail allegations McCabe had deceived investigators about his role in approving the disclosure, even as he lashed out at others in the FBI for leaks.

That leak confirmed the existence of the probe, the report said, which then-FBI director James Comey had up to that point refused to do.

The report said that McCabe ""lacked candor"" in a conversation with Comey when he said he had not authorized the disclosure and didn't know who had done so. The IG also found that he lacked candor when questioned by FBI agents on multiple occasions since that conversation.

McCabe served at the FBI for 21 years. He became the acting director in May 2017 after President Trump fired Comey.

Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe in March 2018 after the inspector general found he had repeatedly misstated his involvement in a leak to The Journal regarding an FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation.

Throughout the investigation, McCabe denied any wrongdoing and said the inspector general’s conclusions relied on mischaracterizations and omissions, including of information favorable to McCabe.

In a wide-ranging appearance before the House oversight committee , Comey also said Clinton ’ s email practices put America ’ s secrets at risk and her actions constituted the “ definition of carelessness . ”
At the same time , Comey staunchly defended the bureau ’ s decision not to pursue charges . He also said , “ We have no basis to conclude that [ Clinton ] lied to the FBI . ”
Yet he acknowledged that lying under oath is a felony , as some Republicans point to statements she made last October before the House Benghazi committee -- and plan to request an investigation . At that hearing , Clinton had claimed that nothing she sent or received was marked classified .
Comey was asked about such claims , which she also made publicly , in a pointed exchange with Rep. Trey Gowdy , R-S.C .
“ That ’ s not true . … There was classified material emailed , ” Comey said .
On her claim that she used one device , Comey also said , “ She used multiple devices . ”
And on her claim that she turned over all work-related emails , he said , “ No , we found work-related emails , thousands that were not returned . ”
“ It ’ s apparent that she lied to the American people , ” Rep. Mark Meadows , R-N.C. , later said of Clinton .
Democrats on the committee tried to make the case for Clinton that she may not have noticed or understood the classified markings in a few emails that bore them , bolstering any claim of plausible deniability . Comey indeed said there is a question over whether Clinton was “ sophisticated enough ” to know at the time what a particular classified marking signified .
Fox News was first to report on a 2012 email that carried a classified code known as a “ portion marking ” when it was sent to Clinton ’ s account .

Ryan also sent a letter to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper urging him to deny Clinton access to classified information “ for the duration of her candidacy for president . ”
“ I firmly believe this is necessary to reassure the public that our nation ’ s secrets are secure , ” he said .
The Clinton campaign is hitting back repeatedly at Republicans , with a top spokesman calling the bid to deny her access to classified information a “ stunt ” and the campaign saying Republicans had voiced “ nothing but confidence ” in Comey before his announcement earlier this week .
But Comey 's decision , and the way he delivered it , infuriated Republicans who felt that the FBI director in his unusually detailed and critical televised statement Tuesday had laid out a sufficient basis for prosecution .
In a stinging assessment of her email practices as secretary of state , Comey rebuked Clinton and her aides for being `` extremely careless '' in their handling of classified information and contradicted many of the defenses and explanations she 's put forward for months . But he also said there was no evidence anyone willfully or intentionally mishandled classified information .
Comey , who served as deputy attorney general in the George W. Bush administration , was appointed in 2013 to a 10-year term as FBI director by President Barack Obama .","FBI Director James Comey testified Thursday that Hillary Clinton’s claims -- some made under oath -- about her use of a private email server were “not true,” fueling Republican questions about whether in doing so she committed a felony.

In a wide-ranging appearance before the House oversight committee, Comey also said Clinton’s email practices put America’s secrets at risk and her actions constituted the “definition of carelessness.”

At the same time, Comey staunchly defended the bureau’s decision not to pursue charges. He also said, “We have no basis to conclude that [Clinton] lied to the FBI.”

Yet he acknowledged that lying under oath is a felony, as some Republicans point to statements she made last October before the House Benghazi committee -- and plan to request an investigation. At that hearing, Clinton had claimed that nothing she sent or received was marked classified.

Comey was asked about such claims, which she also made publicly, in a pointed exchange with Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C.

“That’s not true. … There was classified material emailed,” Comey said.

On her claim that she used one device, Comey also said, “She used multiple devices.”

And on her claim that she turned over all work-related emails, he said, “No, we found work-related emails, thousands that were not returned.”

“It’s apparent that she lied to the American people,” Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., later said of Clinton.

Democrats on the committee tried to make the case for Clinton that she may not have noticed or understood the classified markings in a few emails that bore them, bolstering any claim of plausible deniability. Comey indeed said there is a question over whether Clinton was “sophisticated enough” to know at the time what a particular classified marking signified.

Fox News was first to report on a 2012 email that carried a classified code known as a “portion marking” when it was sent to Clinton’s account.

While the hearing was underway, Clinton herself was hunkered down at her Washington home – as her campaign responded regularly to hearing highlights. The campaign flagged that Comey acknowledged during the hearing that the portion markings themselves were not properly marked.

But Gowdy and House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, whose committee hosted the tense hearing with Comey just two days after the investigation decision, both suggested a “double standard” was at play in the FBI decision.

“It seems to a lot of us that the average Joe … if they had done what you laid out in your statement, that they’d be in handcuffs,” Chaffetz said. “And I think there is a legitimate concern that there is a double-standard -- if your name isn’t Clinton or you’re not part of the powerful elite, that lady justice will act differently.”

Chaffetz voiced concern that there “does seem to be no consequence.”

Yet Comey repeated his claim that “no reasonable prosecutor would bring this case.” He said while Clinton showed “great carelessness,” he did not see evidence she and those with whom she corresponded “knew when they did it they were doing something that was against the law.”

He said no reasonable prosecutor would bring a case based only on what is known as “gross negligence.” At the same time, he suggested that if Clinton had worked at the FBI, she could be subject to a range of disciplinary measures including suspension or termination.

“You could be walked out,” he said.

Comey also denied a double standard was at play, saying no one at the DOJ would have brought such a case against “John Doe or Hillary Clinton” based on the facts.

Democratic committee members slammed the hearing and described the criticism of Comey as political.

Emmett Tyrrell, Geoff Shepard, Mark Hyman","— The Wonderful Wizard of Oz , by L. Frank Baum
Long ago , as a Special Attorney with the Justice Department ’ s Organized Crime and Racketeering Section , I participated in planning and — in a handful of instances — executing arrests of members of La Cosa Nostra and their associates . From personal observation , I early on concluded that , in apprehending mobsters , one of the primary threats to agent safety was the risk of fratricide , i.e. , one amped-up , anxious and heavily armed agent accidentally shooting some other amped-up , anxious and heavily armed agent . The FBI , ATF , and other federal agents with whom I was privileged to work shared that concern . For that reason , they planned operations meticulously and kept the number of arresting agents to the absolute minimum in order to reduce the risk of injury or error .
To that end , I opted whenever possible to avoid arrests altogether by having defense counsel surrender their clients at the marshal ’ s lock up during regular business hours . From the media ’ s standpoint , the visuals must have been underwhelming . But then , we didn ’ t much care about meeting the needs of the news media .

— The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, by L. Frank Baum

Long ago, as a Special Attorney with the Justice Department’s Organized Crime and Racketeering Section, I participated in planning and — in a handful of instances — executing arrests of members of La Cosa Nostra and their associates. From personal observation, I early on concluded that, in apprehending mobsters, one of the primary threats to agent safety was the risk of fratricide, i.e., one amped-up, anxious and heavily armed agent accidentally shooting some other amped-up, anxious and heavily armed agent. The FBI, ATF, and other federal agents with whom I was privileged to work shared that concern. For that reason, they planned operations meticulously and kept the number of arresting agents to the absolute minimum in order to reduce the risk of injury or error.

To that end, I opted whenever possible to avoid arrests altogether by having defense counsel surrender their clients at the marshal’s lock up during regular business hours. From the media’s standpoint, the visuals must have been underwhelming. But then, we didn’t much care about meeting the needs of the news media. Having targets surrender was simple, held down costs, and reduced the risk of harm to one and all.

This is not to say that we never made arrests. Sometimes, we had no choice.

I recall one early morning arrest of a violence-prone mobster. The assigned agents were aware that the target was at a bar with his girlfriend. Since we wanted to take him at his home so that the premises could be searched incident to arrest, the agents parked outside his residence and waited for him to show up.

Around 6:00 A.M., the target arrived and went inside with his girlfriend. Two FBI agents (the total number needed to take down this dangerous felon and conduct the search) knocked on the door. A split second later, the target stepped outside, slammed the door behind him, and announced, “Okay, let’s go.”

By this tactic, he had cleverly defeated our plan to search his residence.

Despite the target’s extensive criminal record, one of the agents said to him, “Vinnie [not his real name], if you promise to behave, I won’t put you in cuffs.” The violent felon smiled and said, “Deal.” Thus, he was transported without handcuffs or incident to the federal building where he was processed.

That’s how the old Hoover era FBI rolled.

But today, with the example of Special Counsel Robert Mueller and the FBI’s recent daring dawn raid and arrest of serial false declarant Roger Stone, it is apparent that my ancient generation of federal law enforcement had it all wrong. Team Mueller’s use of 29 agents plus CNN video support elements were confronted with a challenging tactical problem. Despite the fact that Stone has no prior criminal record, he is nevertheless 66 years old. This is an age when people are sometimes cranky and disagreeable. Obviously, those 29 agents were necessary to establish tactical dominance and to quickly subdue this lawless false declarant. Hopefully, the overwhelming show of force prevented Stone from making any further false declarations during the course of his arrest.

And, equally important, the visuals of the assault broadcast by the CNN tactical elements undoubtedly will serve as a deterrent to others who may harbor thoughts of uttering untruths sworn or otherwise.

All of which leads me to shake my wooly gray head and wonder aloud if any of these two-fisted crime fighters who took down the cunning and dangerous Roger Stone are in any way embarrassed by their participation in this vaudeville act.

I mean, come on! 29 agents? Seriously? Once upon a time, you could have invaded a small country with that much firepower much less arrest a white haired gadfly who allegedly lied to the authorities. Is the wimp quotient really that high in today’s FBI?

Or was there some other reason for this televised silliness? Could it be that Mueller and his team of Hillary Clinton acolytes are trying to fool us with their comedy act? Is this ridiculous armed raid supposed to distract us from the humiliating fact that the Team Mueller elephant has once again given birth to a mouse? Is this an act of misdirection calculated to obscure the fact that Mueller’s Hillary Clinton fan club seems incapable of bringing nothing but process crime indictments devoid of any evidence of Trump-Russia collusion?

If so, they are sadly mistaken. After all these years of investigation, indictments of foreign nationals who will never appear in an American courtroom, and process crimes generated in large part by the investigators themselves, the mask is slipping and the act is wearing thin. Just like the Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the Great and Terrible Mueller is slowly emerging as, in the words of Dorothy, the Great and Terrible humbug.

So what can Team Mueller do to prepare the public for what appears to be the inevitable and ignominious end of their sputtering investigation? Maybe for their next big arrest, the Team Mueller Clintonistas should use 100 FBI agents to surround the target’s luxury condo, land an assault force on the roof, lob some teargas canisters through the windows, kick in the front door and have NBC, ABC and CBS broadcast the event live.

After all, in show business, bigger is always better.

The show-stopping development comes as Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , told Fox News that Horowitz 's comprehensive report on allegations of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) warrant abuse against former Trump campaign aide Carter Page will be released on Dec. 9 . `` That 's locked , '' Graham said .
The new evidence concerning the altered document , which pertained to the FBI 's FISA court warrant application to surveil Page , is expected to be outlined in Horowitz 's upcoming report . CNN first reported the news , which was largely confirmed by The Washington Post .
But the Post , hours after publishing its story , conspicuously removed the portion of its reporting that the FBI employee involved worked `` beneath '' Peter Strzok , the FBI 's since-fired head of counterintelligence . The Post did not offer an explanation for the change , which occurred shortly after midnight . Earlier this week , the DOJ highlighted a slew of anti-Trump text messages sent by Strzok when he was leading the Hillary Clinton email investigation and the probe into the Trump campaign .
`` The person under scrutiny has not been identified but is not a high-ranking official — they worked beneath former deputy assistant director Peter Strzok , according to people familiar with the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss material that has not yet been made public , '' The Post wrote in its now-deleted paragraph .
WAYBACK MACHINE SHOWS ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE POST 'S STORY , BEFORE STEALTH DELETION
The paper eventually added a correction to the bottom of its piece , reading , `` Correction : An earlier version of this story erroneously stated that the FBI employee being investigated for altering a document worked underneath former Deputy Assistant Director Peter Strzok . The employee was a low-level lawyer in the Office of General Counsel and did not report to the deputy assistant director . ''
Nevertheless , Horowitz reportedly found that the FBI employee was involved enough in the FISA process to falsely state that he had `` documentation to back up a claim he had made in discussions with the Justice Department about the factual basis '' for the FISA warrant application , the Post reported . Then , the FBI employee allegedly `` altered an email '' to substantiate his inaccurate version of events . The employee has since been forced out of the bureau .
In its initial 2016 FISA warrant application , the FBI flatly called Page `` an agent of a foreign power . ''
Sources told Fox News last month that U.S. Attorney John Durham 's separate , ongoing probe into potential FBI and Justice Department misconduct in the run-up to the 2016 election through the spring of 2017 has transitioned into a full-fledged criminal investigation -- and that Horowitz 's report will shed light on why Durham 's probe has become a criminal inquiry .
FBI AGENTS MANIPULATED FLYNN FILE , AS CLAPPER ORDERED 'KILL SHOT , ' FILING SAYS
Durham has reportedly taken up Horowitz 's findings concerning the falsified FISA document , meaning the ex-FBI lawyer who made the changes is now under criminal investigation . The Post indicated , however , that the document was not central to the legality of the FISA warrant obtained against Page .
Republicans have long argued that the FBI 's alleged FISA abuses , which came as the bureau aggressively pursued ultimately unsubstantiated claims of criminal links between the Trump team and Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign , were politically motivated . In recent months , a series of unearthed documents has strengthened those claims .
Just nine days before the FBI applied for its first FISA warrant to surveil Page , bureau officials were battling with a senior Justice Department official who had `` continued concerns '' about the `` possible bias '' of a source pivotal to the application , according to internal text messages previously obtained by Fox News .
The 2016 messages , sent between Lisa Page and then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe , also revealed that bureau brass circulated at least two anti-Trump blog articles , including a Lawfare blog post sent shortly after Election Day that called Trump possibly `` among the major threats to the security of the country . ''
DOJ OUTLINES STRZOK 'SECURITY VIOLATIONS ' ; FINDS 'PARANOID ' CASE AGENT NOTICED STRZOK WAS SITTING ON WEINER LAPTOP
Fox News is told the texts were connected to the ultimately successful Page application , which relied in part on information from British ex-spy Christopher Steele – whose anti-Trump views are now well-documented – and cited Page ’ s suspected Russia ties . In its warrant application , the FBI inaccurately assured the FISA court on numerous occasions that media sources independently corroborated Steele 's claims , and did not clearly state that Steele worked for a firm hired by Hillary Clinton 's campaign and the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) .
Much of the Steele dossier has been proved discredited or unsubstantiated , including the dossier 's claims that the Trump campaign was paying hackers in the United States out of a non-existent Russian consulate in Miami , or that ex-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen traveled to Prague to conspire with Russians . Special Counsel Robert Mueller also was unable to substantiate the dossier 's claims that Carter Page had received a large payment relating to the sale of a share of Rosneft , a Russian oil giant , or that a lurid blackmail tape involving the president existed .
Despite being accused by the FBI of being a Russian agent in the FISA application , and being secretly surveilled for more than a year , Page has not been charged with any wrongdoing . He has since sued numerous actors -- including the DNC -- for defamation related to claims that he worked with Russia .

`` OI [ Office of Intelligence ] now has a robust explanation re any possible bias of the chs [ confidential human source ] in the package , '' Lisa Page wrote to McCabe on Oct. 12 , 2016 . `` Do n't know what the holdup is now , other than Stu 's continued concerns . ''
It 's unclear whether the confidential source in question was Steele or another individual . `` Stu '' was an apparent reference to Stuart Evans , then the DOJ 's National Security Division deputy assistant attorney general . In one previously unearthed and since-unredacted text message , Strzok texted Page that he was `` Currently fighting with Stu for this FISA '' in late 2016 .
Page is not the only Trump official to allege misconduct by the FBI . Last month , an explosive court filing from Michael Flynn ’ s legal team alleged that FBI agents manipulated official records of the former national security adviser ’ s 2017 interview that led to him being charged with lying to investigators . Flynn 's attorneys demanded the FBI search its internal `` Sentinel '' system to find more evidence of allegedly doctored files .

Newly released text messages involving text messages between Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page revealed that Page -- who was not present for the Flynn interview -- had apparently made `` edits '' to the so-called `` 302 '' witness report in the case , which was key to Flynn 's prosecution on a false statements charge . Page told Strzok on February 10 , 2017 that she “ gave my edits to Bill to put on your desk . ”
Horowitz told congressional lawmakers in an October letter that his investigation and ensuing report were nearing their conclusion .

Horowitz noted that he did not anticipate a need to prepare or issue `` separate classified and public versions of the report . ''
`` After we receive the final classification markings from the Department and the FBI , we will then proceed with our usual process for preparing a final report , including ensuring that appropriate reviews occur for accuracy and comment purposes , '' Horowitz wrote in the letter . `` Once begun , we do not anticipate the time for that review to be lengthy .

A controversial London-based academic with close ties to Nigel Farage has been detained by the FBI upon arrival in the US and issued a subpoena to testify before Robert Mueller, the special counsel who is investigating possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.

Ted Malloch, an American touted last year as a possible candidate to serve as US ambassador to the EU, said he was interrogated by the FBI at Boston’s Logan airport on Wednesday following a flight from London and questioned about his involvement in the Trump campaign.

In a statement sent to the Guardian, Malloch, who described himself as a policy wonk and defender of Trump, said the FBI also asked him about his relationship with Roger Stone, the Republican strategist, and whether he had ever visited the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where the Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has resided for nearly six years.

Lawyers for former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort are arguing that what could be key evidence against him should be kept out of court because the FBI violated his Constitutional rights by illegally entering a storage locker belonging to Manafort's firm.

The FBI first got into the Alexandria, Va. storage unit last May with the assistance of an employee who worked at two or more of Manafort's companies, an agent told the federal magistrate judge who issued the warrant. Then, the agent used what he saw written on so-called Banker's Boxes and the fact there was a five-drawer filing cabinet to get permission to return and seize many of the records.
