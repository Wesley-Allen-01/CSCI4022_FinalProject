As President Barack Obama searches for his fourth defense secretary in six years , Chuck Hagel ’ s resignation Monday only confirms the perception of how tightly the White House controls the most important national security decision making .
Hagel ’ s departure follows a drumbeat of complaints by his predecessors , former officials and members of Congress that the National Security Council has assumed nearly all the authority for foreign conflicts , counterterrorism and other vital issues — leaving ever-less involvement for the Defense Department and other agencies .
“ I know that Chuck was frustrated with aspects of the administration ’ s national security policy and decision-making process , ” said Sen. John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) , the incoming chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee . “ His predecessors have spoken about the excessive micro-management they faced from the White House and how that made it more difficult to do their jobs successfully . Chuck ’ s situation was no different . ”
Specifically , Hagel had grown frustrated with Obama ’ s unwillingness to mount a serious push on behalf of defense spending , one Senate aide said , as well as other priorities for the Pentagon .
“ Hagel has been pushing back on the administration in regards to the defense budget and some of the defense policy , and that ’ s kind of what led to this , ” the aide said . “ He started to no longer be a yes-man . ”
Hagel formally notified Obama on Monday that he would step down as soon as the Senate confirms his successor — a process that could take months . In a ceremony at the White House , Obama thanked Hagel for his candor .
“ When it ’ s mattered most , behind closed doors in the Oval Office , you ’ ve always given it to me straight , ” the president said . “ For that , I will always be grateful . ”
The president ’ s reference to his and Hagel ’ s behind-the-scenes discussions was the only allusion to the friction that appears to have led Hagel to quit .
Hagel ’ s departure was “ a mutual decision , ” a senior defense official said , reached after “ several weeks ” of discussions about the outlook for the remainder of the administration .
While a senior administration official on Monday praised Hagel ’ s “ steady hand ” during his 22 months on the job , Obama and his inner circle never fully integrated Hagel into the decision-making process and did not hide their concerns about him .
Unlike firings in previous administrations , however , Hagel ’ s departure will not likely mark a new direction in policy , as President George W. Bush wanted when he relieved then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in 2006 .
“ The risk now is making him a scapegoat , when the problems that have most bedeviled us in the Middle East were obviously not his making , ” said Michael O ’ Hanlon , a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution .
A senior defense official acknowledged to ███ that there had been policy differences between Hagel and National Security Adviser Susan Rice but said no single disagreement had prompted Hagel ’ s departure .
“ Did he and Rice agree on everything ? No — but that ’ s normal , that ’ s healthy . This is not about him vs. Susan Rice , ” the official said . “ The secretary is not resigning in protest . ”
The White House said that Hagel initiated conversations about his role in October “ given the natural post-midterms transition time. ” He finally decided to resign last week .
Hagel told troops in a message on Monday that he didn ’ t make his decision “ lightly ” and urged them to keep their attention on deployments around the world and the work of running the vast Defense Department .
“ That work will continue , ” he wrote . “ It must continue . The world is still too dangerous , the threats too numerous , for us to lose focus . And even as I promised the president my full support going forward , so , too , do I promise that I will work hard to support you right up until my last day in office . I owe you that . ”
The president said he intends to move quickly to name a successor , though no firm timetable has been suggested . The Republicans take control of the Senate in January .
House Armed Services Committee Chairman Rep. Buck McKeon ( R-Calif. ) told CNN on Monday he was “ flabbergasted ” to hear from Hagel that he was quitting — and warned that whoever Obama picks to replace him can expect “ to have a very tough time ” in the Senate .
Hagel ’ s resignation was not publicly expected and rattled the Washington defense establishment .
Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby had said after the Nov. 4 midterm elections that Hagel had committed to remaining in the administration for its final two years . At a defense conference in California earlier this month , Hagel delivered a speech about acquisition reform as usual and gave no sign that he was planning to leave .
“ I don ’ t get up in the morning and worry about my job , ” Hagel told Charlie Rose in an interview televised last week .
All the same , Hagel ’ s tenure has more often been an anchor for Obama than a help . He endured a long and painful confirmation process that included a widely panned hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee and several weeks of limbo as a Republican filibuster kept him on ice .
More recently he has battled behind the scenes with Rice , even sending her a memo sharply critical of the administration ’ s strategy for Syria . Senior defense officials have complained in reports by several news organizations , including ███ Magazine , about the National Security Council ’ s micromanagement of national security and the growing centralization of decision making by the White House .
Both of Hagel ’ s predecessors in the Obama administration , Robert Gates and Leon Panetta , have written books complaining about the president ’ s national security policy process , and other critics seized on Hagel ’ s departure on Monday .
Hagel and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey have sought to preserve maneuvering room for U.S. commanders to send troops to Iraq to help Iraqis in their battle against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant .
Now , Obama must gear up for a major new confirmation battle in the Senate , depending on how quickly he can find a replacement .
Potential successors could include Michèle Flournoy , a former undersecretary of defense who now runs the Center for a New American Security ; Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work ; or another administration alumnus such as Ash Carter , who stepped down as Hagel ’ s first deputy secretary .
Hagel ’ s tenure at the Pentagon has mostly been reactive . He launched major studies or reviews following the 2013 Washington Navy Yard shooting , scandals at military hospitals and revelations about cheating and decay within the Air Force ’ s nuclear weapons units .
He also has taken on Panetta ’ s initiative to integrate more women into combat units , but that work has been slow in the Marine officer corps and in the special operations forces .
The Army has just begun an initial effort to send women to its elite Ranger School ; completing that work will be among the challenges waiting for Hagel ’ s successor .
House Speaker John Boehner said Washington must use the transition as an opportunity to re-examine Obama ’ s strategy for fighting ISIL in Syria and Iraq .
“ This personnel change must be part of a larger rethinking of our strategy to confront the threats we face abroad , especially the threat posed by the rise of ISIL , ” he said . “ We can not defeat this enemy without a broad , coordinated , well-thought-out effort that has the strong support of the American people . Thus far , this administration has fallen well short . ”","Hagel's resignation underscores defense rifts Obama and his inner circle didn’t hide their concerns about the defense secretary.

Hagel’s departure was “a mutual decision,” a senior defense official said, reached after “several weeks” of discussions about the outlook for the remainder of the administration.

Manning , the soldier convicted of leaking a trove of classified documents , was sentenced to 35 years in prison Wednesday for the largest public breach of secret data in U.S. history , sparking a debate over the length of his prison term and whether he could ever win an early release .
The judge , Col. Denise Lind , also demoted him from private first class to private and dishonorably discharged him from the Army at a brief court-martial hearing at Fort Meade , Md .
Military law specialists seemed to generally agree that the sentence was merited . But civil liberties and anti-secrecy advocates were angered , with some calling for President Obama to commute the sentence or pardon Manning altogether .
Manning , 25 , was convicted July 30 on 20 charges , including six under the Espionage Act , for downloading , copying and passing to WikiLeaks more than 700,000 raw U.S. military battlefield reports from Iraq and Afghanistan and State Department cables , all classified “ Secret . ”
He also provided the anti-secrecy website with a classified 2007 gunsight video of a U.S. Apache helicopter firing at suspected insurgents in Baghdad . The video — which shows a dozen people , including two employees of the Reuters news agency , being mowed down amid casual chatter by the troops — was dubbed by WikiLeaks as “ Collateral Murder . ”
Eugene R. Fidell , a Washington lawyer who lectures on military justice at Yale Law School , said he thought the sentence “ might be a shade on the high side , ” adding it was likely calibrated “ to deter others from committing the same crime in the future . ”

“ I don ’ t think either the defense or the prosecution should look at this as a victory , ” Mr. Fidell said .
He added that , in the military prison system , inmates who stay out of trouble can get their sentence reduced by up to 10 days a month — almost by a third over the term of their incarceration .
With 3 1/2 years ’ credit for time served , Manning could be eligible for parole in 10 years .
However , Gary R. Myers , a lawyer who has represented several high-profile military defendants , said , “ That isn ’ t going to happen . I view parole as unlikely in this case because of the very serious nature of the offense . ”
“ This man is going to leave prison in his 40s with his youth spent in jail , and I think that is appropriate , ” added Mr. Myers , whose clients include personnel involved in both the Mai Lai massacre in Vietnam and the Abu Ghraib torture scandal in Iraq .
But Michael Ratner of the left-leaning Center for Constitutional Rights said that “ 35 years for telling the truth is outrageously long , ” calling Manning a whistleblower and a hero .
The White House said that there was a procedure for requesting a pardon , and that Manning or his supporters were “ welcome ” to use it .
In her verdict last month , Col. Lind , found Manning not guilty of the most serious charge of aiding the enemy , an offense that could have meant life in prison without parole .
Maj. Ashden Fein , the prosecutor , argued that the charge was justified because Manning gave secrets to a group of anti-secrecy activists , knowing the material would be seen by terrorists .
Manning had faced a potential maximum sentence of 90 years .
He apologized last week in a short statement during a sentencing hearing .
“ I ’ m sorry that my actions hurt people , ” he said . “ I ’ m sorry that they hurt the United States . When I made these decisions , I believed I was going to help people , not hurt people . ”
His defense attorney , David Coombs , argued that the military was partly to blame because it should have pulled Manning ’ s access to classified documents after a series of extreme emotional events the junior intelligence analyst experienced during his deployment in Iraq .

He ’ s been so much of an enigma in nine muted months at the Pentagon that one frequent critic , Sen. Kelly Ayotte ( R-N.H. ) , was heard to ask aloud , “ What ’ s with this guy ? ” as she emerged from a low-energy meeting with the heavy-lidded defense secretary , according to one fellow senator . So White House officials were stunned when Hagel abruptly spit the bit over the summer .
By August , the first round of across-the-board cuts mandated by the congressionally imposed process known as budget sequestration had forced the Pentagon to slash its massive personnel costs . Obama ’ s White House team was controlling the talking points , and these defense cuts were an especially powerful part of their political message : Republicans , they claimed , were willing to endanger national security to appease their anti-government Tea Party wing . So it came as unwelcome news when Hagel declared—without getting West Wing approval—that he was exercising his authority to reinstate five of 11 furlough days for the department ’ s civilian employees , according to several current and former administration officials . White House aides called Hagel ’ s team to complain . The secretary didn ’ t care . He was growing increasingly concerned that the administration was ignoring the Pentagon ’ s budget and readiness crises , and he directed his staff to give a mid-level agency bureaucrat a one-hour head ’ s up before he went public . “ Hagel didn ’ t want to slow the process down , ” a former defense official told me . “ So he just decided to do it , and he did it… Message sent . ”
It ’ s too early to tell if Hagel ’ s sotto voce declaration of independence was a genuine pivot point . But it ’ s clear the 67-year-old Vietnam War hero is entering the make-or-break phase of his Pentagon stewardship , according to about a dozen current and former West Wing and Pentagon officials I spoke with . Up until recently , they say , Hagel appeared shaky , a career legislator struggling with his first big command—and under constant fire . “ How would I describe him right now ? He ’ s a paper tiger , ” says a longtime Obama campaign and White House adviser . “ He ’ s a great guy and a war hero . The regular troops love him . … It ’ s not quite buyer ’ s remorse , but he needs to show us more . ”
Obama ’ s people may yet get their wish , if perhaps in ways they hadn ’ t quite anticipated . In recent days , Secretary of State John Kerry has hogged the spotlight with his headlong-into-the-breach diplomacy with Iran . But it is Hagel who might face the potentially greater career-defining moment : Over the next six weeks , he ’ ll have to battle Congress , and perhaps some on Obama ’ s West Wing team , to forestall unprecedented new defense cuts that , when added to the first round of sequester cuts , could slash as much as $ 100 billion a year ( according to Obama administration estimates ) from a Pentagon accustomed to Bush-era annual budgets of $ 700 billion . It ’ s the sort of bloodletting that could force commanders to choose between modern weapons systems , funding benefits programs or paying to retain enough troops to meet new threats . In effect , what has followed the low-key secretary ( self-effacing to a fault—he has described defense as “ the fourth ” most powerful gig in Obama ’ s Cabinet ) to his memento-crammed office on the third floor of the Pentagon is a fight that could now determine the ambition of the military in the post-Afghanistan and Iraq era .
“ How would I describe him right now ? He ’ s a paper tiger , ” says a longtime White House advisor . “ He ’ s a great guy and a war hero . The regular troops love him … but he needs to show us more . ”
There ’ s no doubt that Hagel shares Obama ’ s philosophy of a leaner and more efficient military , and he voiced only perfunctory objections to the $ 50 billion-a-year hit the Pentagon took in the 2012 budget deal—and toes the administration line that all sequester cuts , to military and domestic programs , need to be restores in full . He also embraced a long-term Obama budget proposal that would backload billions of dollars more in cuts over the next decade . But the additional $ 20 billion to $ 50 billion in yearly cuts due to take effect next month if congressional negotiators can ’ t avert a second sequester are too much for Hagel . Obama opposes the cuts too , but Hagel is pressing to de-link the Pentagon ’ s budget from the non-defense budget , a stance that puts him in conflict with the White House bargaining position at a crucial moment : If Republicans want to avoid the defense cuts , Obama is trying to make the case that they will also have to spare the ax for an array of social welfare and infrastructure programs . “ If you just to start to carve out certain popular items from the sequester you don ’ t solve the problem , ” a person close to Obama told me when asked about Hagel ’ s position . “ Chuck is just doing his job . … He wants to exempt the military from the sequester , and that ’ s understandable . But we ’ re looking to get rid of the sequester across the board . ”
Hagel has directed most of his public comments at GOP budget-cutters but he ’ s also made it clear he ’ s dissatisfied with some in the administration , especially Obama ’ s Office of Management and Budget Director Sylvia Mathews Burwell who , in the words of one Hagel confidant , “ just doesn ’ t get the urgency ” of the threat . “ This is an irresponsible way to govern , and it forces the department into a very bad set of choices , '' Hagel said earlier this month of the sequester , speaking to an audience at the Reagan Library .
John Kerry has hogged the spotlight with his headlong-into-the-breach diplomacy on Iran . But it is Hagel , with his upcoming battle with Congress and maybe even the White House to forestall proposed defense cuts , who may face the greater career-defining moment . | Reuters
But here ’ s where the months of lackluster leadership at the Pentagon might pose a key problem for Hagel , a former infantry squad leader in Vietnam now entering a big bureaucratic fight well below full battle strength . His top deputy , the highly regarded Ashton Carter—himself a candidate for defense secretary and a man who has been running the place day to day for two years—is leaving this month . Several top-level former defense officials , including the department ’ s one-time No . 3 , Michèle Flournoy , another also-ran for the secretaryship when Hagel got the job , have rebuffed entreaties to join the team , say people close to the situation .
Hagel ’ s grasp of granular budget and manpower issues have improved greatly over the last few months , and people close to him say he has even booted out staffers from briefings if they don ’ t have the information he needs at the ready . But he ’ s still a relative neophyte , and having a first-class deputy remains a necessity . “ I sure hope it 's a strong pick , ” says Sen. John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) . “ And I sure hope it 's somebody with experience in the Pentagon . ”
That Hagel is the secretary of defense at all is a minor political miracle . He nearly flamed out during late January confirmation hearings—he mortified his handlers by suggesting he could live with a nuclear-armed Iran until he was handed a note telling him : nope , no way , take it back—where he looked confused , sluggish and generally unprepared , leading to the tightest confirmation vote of any Obama cabinet official . The performance made Hagel easy pickings for critics like Sen. Ted Cruz ( R-Texas ) , who blasted Hagel as an ally of Tehran and enemy of Israel . His near-mute testimony this fall defending the administration ’ s muddled Syria policy , especially alongside Kerry 's much more animated performance , was nearly as unimpressive . “ Next time we have a hearing and he sits next to John Kerry at a hearing , you know , I 'd like to hear from him too , ” quips McCain , a fellow Vietnam veteran who considers himself to be Hagel ’ s friend , despite Hagel ’ s decision not to endorse him during the 2008 general election . “ He 's been kind of low-visibility . But I do n't think necessarily he 's been a weak secretary of defense . ”
Indeed , a low-key manager is what Obama ’ s national security team wanted to succeed first-term Pentagon chiefs Bob Gates , a steely commander who steadied the place after the disastrous invasion of Iraq under Donald Rumsfeld , and Leon Panetta , a canny former member of Congress and White House chief of staff who ran the building , in the words of one former subordinate , “ like a big Italian dinner. ” By the time of Panetta ’ s exit , almost all key strategic decisions on Iraq and Afghanistan had been made and Obama settled on Hagel in part because he was convinced that a Republican , even one mostly estranged from his party , would be best positioned to oversee a new era of contraction and recalibration . Hagel embraced the position , and rather than compete with White House chief of staff Denis McDonough , Kerry and national security adviser Susan Rice for a marquee foreign policy role , he has focused on allocating resources wisely and on adapting the military ’ s postwar strategy toward the challenges of the future in a rising Asia rather than the lingering complications of the last century ’ s conflicts still so evident in the Middle East . “ That stuff is really unsexy but someone ’ s got to do it , ” says Andrew Exum , a former Army Ranger and Pentagon consultant .
Hagel has been bracingly candid about his role . “ I 've never seen my job or the time I ’ ll spend here as defining a Hagel era , ” he told the Atlantic ’ s Steve Clemons in an October interview . “ I ’ ve never seen it that way . … I do n't see it as a Hagel imprint . The way I do see my role is what can I do to improve our security ? What can I do to improve this institution while I 'm here ? How can I enhance it by my leadership and by my presence ? And then the rest of it takes care of itself . ”
If Hagel ’ s furrowed face looks like frozen masonry on C-Span , he is steady and forthright in the flesh , which has endeared him to staffers and helped him overcome suspicions inside the Pentagon that he ’ s an Obama yes-man . He works the building like he used to work the Nebraska State Fair , a bit awkwardly but with plenty of gusto . On the Monday before Thanksgiving , I was allowed to peek into his office as a three-star general squired in an elderly civilian employee and his wife for a photo op . After presenting the man with a plaque celebrating 50 years of service , Hagel asked the man 's wife what she planned to cook for the holiday . “ Turkey , um , with cranberries , ” she answered nervously , and then asked him what he planned to eat . “ Oh , I ’ m from Indian country , ” Hagel declared . “ We eat steak ! ”

He may be at ease with his employees , but Hagel has clearly been thrown off his politician ’ s game by his terrible debut . He was “ deeply shaken ” by his self-inflicted confirmation trauma , a source who counts him as a friend told me , “ and was really shocked by how hostile the political environment had become. ” At times , he ’ s seemed more like a secretary on defense—an outsider squeezed between Obama ’ s political imperatives and the Pentagon brass he ’ s now surrounded by . In late August , Hagel argued privately to the White House against a military strike in Syria and was overruled by Obama . He sat mostly in silence when he and Kerry appeared together ostensibly to sell the intervention policy to the Hill , and he flubbed key facts when he did speak , including a faulty assertion that Russia had been the main supplier of Syria ’ s homegrown chemical weapons program . Even then , he was overshadowed by Martin Dempsey , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , who made no secret of his frustration with the White House , which then quickly blamed Dempsey for leaks questioning the effectiveness of a limited missile attack on Syria and the logistics of mustering forces to pull it off .

Behind the scenes as this Syria drama played out , Hagel was preoccupied with a different struggle : the budget crisis that is likely to consume his Pentagon tenure . By the fall , he was beginning to grasp just how degraded Army and Marine units had become after years of war . The Pentagon ’ s Strategic Choices and Management Review—a deep-dive report issued in late summer—painted a bleak picture : To cover the cost for modern weapons systems , the Pentagon would need to shrink the Army and Marines to about 520,000 troops , the smallest force since the end of World War II , and far below the 700,000 the department deemed sufficient to deal with emerging threats . The “ Skimmer , ” as the report is known in the building , nudged Hagel closer to the service chiefs , especially Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno , a hard-charging battlefield commander who had clashed with Hagel over the Iraq surge years before .
The paradox is that Hagel , a brash non-commissioned officer who once counseled an inexperienced Senator Obama to stand up the generals seven years ago , now finds himself increasingly motivated by their priorities . “ There ’ s a cognitive disconnect between the Pentagon and the White House , and he ’ s aware of that , ” a Panetta-era Pentagon official told me .
The balancing act—between the attraction to power and the compulsion to buck authority—is the leitmotif of Hagel ’ s four-decade career . In 1968 , Hagel , a 21-year-old army sergeant , found himself leading a unit that , contrary to military regulations , included his younger brother Tom . In the span of a month , the two took turns saving each other ’ s lives . When Chuck was struck by shrapnel in the chest , Tom patched it , stanching a fountain of blood with a bandage . Weeks after that , Chuck pulled his unconscious brother from a burning personnel carrier , later telling a reporter , “ I vowed then to do what I could to stop wars . ”
A disaffected Tom Hagel , like John Kerry , turned against the war when he returned home and embraced liberal , anti-war politics . Chuck Hagel took John McCain ’ s change-the-system-from-the-inside path . He became active in Republican politics , and the two brothers sometimes came to blows over their political differences .
Chuck would go on to make a fortune in the cell phone business , before later carving out a unique political niche in the Senate . To no one ’ s surprise , he was among the first Republicans to call President George W. Bush to account for the series of mistakes that led to the Iraq debacle , and he joined Obama in speaking out against the Iraq troop surge in 2007—which he called the “ most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since Vietnam. ” He spurned his friend McCain a year later during the general election , tacitly supporting Obama ’ s anti-war candidacy .
Since being appointed to run the Pentagon , Hagel has been cast in a supporting actor role , says Tom Ricks , the Pulitzer Prize winner who wrote the definitive account of the Bush administration ’ s management failures in Iraq . He regards Hagel as “ a soporific version of William Cohen , ” Bill Clinton ’ s low-key second-term defense secretary , “ another Senate Armed Services [ Committee member ] picked by a Dem late in the administration to keep the deck chairs from sloshing over the side . Not a bad guy to have at the end of a presidency . ”
That perception isn ’ t entirely fair . Hagel played a critical role in keeping open ties with the Egyptian military following its overthrow of the Muslim Brotherhood and he ’ s also been the administration ’ s standard-bearer on its fits-and-starts focus on Asia , making three trips to the region in the first few months he was in office while Kerry focused on the Middle East . In recent days , he ’ s burned up the phone lines with Japanese leaders in order to avoid any provocation over Beijing ’ s announcement demanding airspace control over a vast swath of the East China Sea—but he was also supportive of the decision to send a flight of unarmed B-52s to the disputed zone as a show of force . In another small act of self-assertion , he ordered the aircraft carrier U.S.S . George Washington to the Philippines in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan with only a cursory head ’ s up to Obama ’ s national security team , which was debating whether or not to “ militarize ” the response , according to a defense official .
Hagel has taken on thankless tasks , too , serving as Obama ’ s human shield on the sensitive issue of the Pentagon ’ s sexual assault adjudication policy ; Hagel has embraced some internal reforms but resisted Senate efforts to remove investigations from the military ’ s chain of command , a proposal that is anathema to his top commanders but a position that has earned him the ire of Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ( D-N.Y. ) . “ He has not shown leadership . … I think he has not lived up to his promises , the promises of having the passion and the drive for rooting out the scourge of sexual violence , ” she told me . “ I don ’ t think that he has lived up to my expectations . ”
Dealing with these external pressures might actually be easier than the internal challenges . All second-term secretaries are forced to confront a brain drain , but Hagel is finding that replacing outgoing staffers is an especially tall order for a Pentagon bracing for a future of tightening budgets and diminishing influence . The departure of Carter , Hagel ’ s highly regarded deputy secretary , does n't come as a surprise given that Carter had been passed over for the top job . But clearly there was friction ; he had agitated , with little success , for Hagel to take a more active role in foreign policy , according to people close to both men . When Hagel ’ s team quietly reached out to Flournoy about her interest—the former Pentagon policy planning chief who left the administration after also being short-listed for the secretary job—she politely declined the offer , according to three people familiar with the situation . Lesser-known Robert Work , a 60-year-old former undersecretary of the Navy , is now considered the top candidate but Hagel was still interviewing other officials as recently as last week , according to administration officials .

Hagel has had similar problems filling the department ’ s vacated top policy post . Over the past month , Hagel ’ s team has reportedly gauged the interest of several candidates , including Kurt Campbell , a former top State Department official who co-founded ( with Flournoy ) the Center for a New American Security . Another prominent think-tanker , Kathleen Hicks of the Center for Strategic and International Studies , also took a pass . “ To some extent you are seeing the Clinton effect , ” says a former defense official who served under President Bill Clinton and recently turned down a Pentagon job offer . “ Why take the risks of working in a second Obama administration , when you can make $ 300,000 in the private sector and then go work for Hillary ? ”
Of course Hagel ’ s greatest challenge may be figuring out the insider game in an administration known for aggregating national security power in the West Wing . Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-S.C. ) , a hawk who admires Hagel ’ s independence , says he would be wise to emulate his predecessor , Panetta , a sharp-elbowed bureaucratic infighter with an avuncular public image . “ Chuck needs to pick up where Panetta left off … fight ’ em from the inside . … If he ’ s not following Leon ’ s lead , he ’ s making a big mistake . ”
Hagel seems to be moving in that direction . He has butted heads with Burwell , the OMB director , over how she is pitching the impact of the cuts to Congress , pressing her to illustrate more vividly—district-by-district—the effects that defense cuts would have on members of Congress . And he has quietly made the case to McDonough and others that they need to take a more active role in bipartisan budget negotiations being run by Rep. Paul Ryan ( R-Wis. ) and Sen. Patty Murray ( D-Wash. ) , at a time when most of Obama ’ s attention has been occupied by meltdown of Obamacare . Hagel has also taken a few less conventional steps , meeting last month with Tina Tchen , Michelle Obama ’ s chief of staff , in an effort to convince the first lady that Pentagon cuts will hit military families hardest . Meanwhile , Hagel has upped his public profile , sitting for a series of mostly gaffe-free interviews with foreign policy reporters and delivering speeches suggesting , ever so subtly , that he won ’ t remain silent if Obama allows the sequester cuts to go through .
But critics wonder if Hagel will directly challenge Obama , whom he befriended in the Senate at a time when the Illinois freshman knew next to nothing about foreign or military affairs . Even Hagel ’ s allies aren ’ t sure entirely how committed he is to holding the line on budget cuts , or even what that line is . He raised eyebrows among Senate Democrats in November by telling Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid ( D-Nev. ) , “ I don ’ t have money , but I can handle that , ” during a phone conversation—which they read as a “ sign of weakness , ” in the words of one Democratic senator who told me about it .
Republicans , clearly relishing the travails of a turncoat , are less charitable . “ The first thing he ’ s got to do is confront the political team in the White House which is … asserting too much influence over policy decisions , ” says Sen. Jeff Sessions ( R-Ala. ) , an Armed Services Committee member and one of 27 Senate Republicans to oppose Hagel ’ s confirmation . “ I just think it ’ s his duty to speak the truth to the president and stand up , and you can ’ t just always continue in office if you are asked to execute a policy that you truly believe is harmful . You have to make up your mind if you should stay or leave . ”
If his own history is any guide , Hagel isn ’ t about to rip off his stripes in protest . “ He ’ s not going anywhere , ” said a senior administration official close to the secretary . Yet it ’ s hard not to hear a 1980s-vintage Republican strain in Hagel ’ s recent public utterances on the need to maintain a robust defense , and he has become increasingly fond of invoking another president , the first one for whom he ever worked .
“ President Reagan understood the importance of the readiness of our defense enterprise , ” Hagel—who helped run the Gipper ’ s Nebraska operation in 1980—told his audience at the Reagan Library last month . “ President Reagan inherited a military that was still grappling with the legacy of the Vietnam War . … [ He ] began the rebuilding of America 's military readiness and capabilities . But it took leadership , it took time and it took resources . ”

Since he became President Obama’s secretary of defense earlier this year, Chuck Hagel, the ruthlessly candid and occasionally contrarian former Republican senator from Nebraska, has mostly kept his inner maverick in check.

It’s too early to tell if Hagel’s sotto voce declaration of independence was a genuine pivot point. But it’s clear the 67-year-old Vietnam War hero is entering the make-or-break phase of his Pentagon stewardship, according to about a dozen current and former West Wing and Pentagon officials I spoke with. Up until recently, they say, Hagel appeared shaky, a career legislator struggling with his first big command—and under constant fire. “How would I describe him right now? He’s a paper tiger,” says a longtime Obama campaign and White House adviser. “He’s a great guy and a war hero. The regular troops love him. … It’s not quite buyer’s remorse, but he needs to show us more.”

Obama’s people may yet get their wish, if perhaps in ways they hadn’t quite anticipated. In recent days, Secretary of State John Kerry has hogged the spotlight with his headlong-into-the-breach diplomacy with Iran. But it is Hagel who might face the potentially greater career-defining moment: Over the next six weeks, he’ll have to battle Congress, and perhaps some on Obama’s West Wing team, to forestall unprecedented new defense cuts that, when added to the first round of sequester cuts, could slash as much as $100 billion a year (according to Obama administration estimates) from a Pentagon accustomed to Bush-era annual budgets of $700 billion. It’s the sort of bloodletting that could force commanders to choose between modern weapons systems, funding benefits programs or paying to retain enough troops to meet new threats. In effect, what has followed the low-key secretary (self-effacing to a fault—he has described defense as “the fourth” most powerful gig in Obama’s Cabinet) to his memento-crammed office on the third floor of the Pentagon is a fight that could now determine the ambition of the military in the post-Afghanistan and Iraq era.

“How would I describe him right now? He’s a paper tiger,” says a longtime White House advisor. “He’s a great guy and a war hero. The regular troops love him … but he needs to show us more.”

Hagel has directed most of his public comments at GOP budget-cutters but he’s also made it clear he’s dissatisfied with some in the administration, especially Obama’s Office of Management and Budget Director Sylvia Mathews Burwell who, in the words of one Hagel confidant, “just doesn’t get the urgency” of the threat. “This is an irresponsible way to govern, and it forces the department into a very bad set of choices,"" Hagel said earlier this month of the sequester, speaking to an audience at the Reagan Library.

But here’s where the months of lackluster leadership at the Pentagon might pose a key problem for Hagel, a former infantry squad leader in Vietnam now entering a big bureaucratic fight well below full battle strength. His top deputy, the highly regarded Ashton Carter—himself a candidate for defense secretary and a man who has been running the place day to day for two years—is leaving this month. Several top-level former defense officials, including the department’s one-time No. 3, Michèle Flournoy, another also-ran for the secretaryship when Hagel got the job, have rebuffed entreaties to join the team, say people close to the situation.

Hagel’s grasp of granular budget and manpower issues have improved greatly over the last few months, and people close to him say he has even booted out staffers from briefings if they don’t have the information he needs at the ready. But he’s still a relative neophyte, and having a first-class deputy remains a necessity. “I sure hope it's a strong pick,” says Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). “And I sure hope it's somebody with experience in the Pentagon.”

That Hagel is the secretary of defense at all is a minor political miracle. He nearly flamed out during late January confirmation hearings—he mortified his handlers by suggesting he could live with a nuclear-armed Iran until he was handed a note telling him: nope, no way, take it back—where he looked confused, sluggish and generally unprepared, leading to the tightest confirmation vote of any Obama cabinet official. The performance made Hagel easy pickings for critics like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who blasted Hagel as an ally of Tehran and enemy of Israel. His near-mute testimony this fall defending the administration’s muddled Syria policy, especially alongside Kerry's much more animated performance, was nearly as unimpressive. “Next time we have a hearing and he sits next to John Kerry at a hearing, you know, I'd like to hear from him too,” quips McCain, a fellow Vietnam veteran who considers himself to be Hagel’s friend, despite Hagel’s decision not to endorse him during the 2008 general election. “He's been kind of low-visibility. But I don't think necessarily he's been a weak secretary of defense.”

Indeed, a low-key manager is what Obama’s national security team wanted to succeed first-term Pentagon chiefs Bob Gates, a steely commander who steadied the place after the disastrous invasion of Iraq under Donald Rumsfeld, and Leon Panetta, a canny former member of Congress and White House chief of staff who ran the building, in the words of one former subordinate, “like a big Italian dinner.” By the time of Panetta’s exit, almost all key strategic decisions on Iraq and Afghanistan had been made and Obama settled on Hagel in part because he was convinced that a Republican, even one mostly estranged from his party, would be best positioned to oversee a new era of contraction and recalibration. Hagel embraced the position, and rather than compete with White House chief of staff Denis McDonough, Kerry and national security adviser Susan Rice for a marquee foreign policy role, he has focused on allocating resources wisely and on adapting the military’s postwar strategy toward the challenges of the future in a rising Asia rather than the lingering complications of the last century’s conflicts still so evident in the Middle East. “That stuff is really unsexy but someone’s got to do it,” says Andrew Exum, a former Army Ranger and Pentagon consultant.

Hagel has been bracingly candid about his role. “I've never seen my job or the time I’ll spend here as defining a Hagel era,” he told the Atlantic’s Steve Clemons in an October interview. “I’ve never seen it that way. … I don't see it as a Hagel imprint. The way I do see my role is what can I do to improve our security? What can I do to improve this institution while I'm here? How can I enhance it by my leadership and by my presence? And then the rest of it takes care of itself.”

If Hagel’s furrowed face looks like frozen masonry on C-Span, he is steady and forthright in the flesh, which has endeared him to staffers and helped him overcome suspicions inside the Pentagon that he’s an Obama yes-man. He works the building like he used to work the Nebraska State Fair, a bit awkwardly but with plenty of gusto. On the Monday before Thanksgiving, I was allowed to peek into his office as a three-star general squired in an elderly civilian employee and his wife for a photo op. After presenting the man with a plaque celebrating 50 years of service, Hagel asked the man's wife what she planned to cook for the holiday. “Turkey, um, with cranberries,” she answered nervously, and then asked him what he planned to eat. “Oh, I’m from Indian country,” Hagel declared. “We eat steak!”

He may be at ease with his employees, but Hagel has clearly been thrown off his politician’s game by his terrible debut. He was “deeply shaken” by his self-inflicted confirmation trauma, a source who counts him as a friend told me, “and was really shocked by how hostile the political environment had become.” At times, he’s seemed more like a secretary on defense—an outsider squeezed between Obama’s political imperatives and the Pentagon brass he’s now surrounded by. In late August, Hagel argued privately to the White House against a military strike in Syria and was overruled by Obama. He sat mostly in silence when he and Kerry appeared together ostensibly to sell the intervention policy to the Hill, and he flubbed key facts when he did speak, including a faulty assertion that Russia had been the main supplier of Syria’s homegrown chemical weapons program. Even then, he was overshadowed by Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who made no secret of his frustration with the White House, which then quickly blamed Dempsey for leaks questioning the effectiveness of a limited missile attack on Syria and the logistics of mustering forces to pull it off.

Behind the scenes as this Syria drama played out, Hagel was preoccupied with a different struggle: the budget crisis that is likely to consume his Pentagon tenure. By the fall, he was beginning to grasp just how degraded Army and Marine units had become after years of war. The Pentagon’s Strategic Choices and Management Review—a deep-dive report issued in late summer—painted a bleak picture: To cover the cost for modern weapons systems, the Pentagon would need to shrink the Army and Marines to about 520,000 troops, the smallest force since the end of World War II, and far below the 700,000 the department deemed sufficient to deal with emerging threats. The “Skimmer,” as the report is known in the building, nudged Hagel closer to the service chiefs, especially Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno, a hard-charging battlefield commander who had clashed with Hagel over the Iraq surge years before.

The paradox is that Hagel, a brash non-commissioned officer who once counseled an inexperienced Senator Obama to stand up the generals seven years ago, now finds himself increasingly motivated by their priorities. “There’s a cognitive disconnect between the Pentagon and the White House, and he’s aware of that,” a Panetta-era Pentagon official told me.

The balancing act—between the attraction to power and the compulsion to buck authority—is the leitmotif of Hagel’s four-decade career. In 1968, Hagel, a 21-year-old army sergeant, found himself leading a unit that, contrary to military regulations, included his younger brother Tom. In the span of a month, the two took turns saving each other’s lives. When Chuck was struck by shrapnel in the chest, Tom patched it, stanching a fountain of blood with a bandage. Weeks after that, Chuck pulled his unconscious brother from a burning personnel carrier, later telling a reporter, “I vowed then to do what I could to stop wars.”

A disaffected Tom Hagel, like John Kerry, turned against the war when he returned home and embraced liberal, anti-war politics. Chuck Hagel took John McCain’s change-the-system-from-the-inside path. He became active in Republican politics, and the two brothers sometimes came to blows over their political differences.

Chuck would go on to make a fortune in the cell phone business, before later carving out a unique political niche in the Senate. To no one’s surprise, he was among the first Republicans to call President George W. Bush to account for the series of mistakes that led to the Iraq debacle, and he joined Obama in speaking out against the Iraq troop surge in 2007—which he called the “most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since Vietnam.” He spurned his friend McCain a year later during the general election, tacitly supporting Obama’s anti-war candidacy.

Since being appointed to run the Pentagon, Hagel has been cast in a supporting actor role, says Tom Ricks, the Pulitzer Prize winner who wrote the definitive account of the Bush administration’s management failures in Iraq. He regards Hagel as “a soporific version of William Cohen,” Bill Clinton’s low-key second-term defense secretary, “another Senate Armed Services [Committee member] picked by a Dem late in the administration to keep the deck chairs from sloshing over the side. Not a bad guy to have at the end of a presidency.”

That perception isn’t entirely fair. Hagel played a critical role in keeping open ties with the Egyptian military following its overthrow of the Muslim Brotherhood and he’s also been the administration’s standard-bearer on its fits-and-starts focus on Asia, making three trips to the region in the first few months he was in office while Kerry focused on the Middle East. In recent days, he’s burned up the phone lines with Japanese leaders in order to avoid any provocation over Beijing’s announcement demanding airspace control over a vast swath of the East China Sea—but he was also supportive of the decision to send a flight of unarmed B-52s to the disputed zone as a show of force. In another small act of self-assertion, he ordered the aircraft carrier U.S.S. George Washington to the Philippines in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan with only a cursory head’s up to Obama’s national security team, which was debating whether or not to “militarize” the response, according to a defense official.

Hagel has taken on thankless tasks, too, serving as Obama’s human shield on the sensitive issue of the Pentagon’s sexual assault adjudication policy; Hagel has embraced some internal reforms but resisted Senate efforts to remove investigations from the military’s chain of command, a proposal that is anathema to his top commanders but a position that has earned him the ire of Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.). “He has not shown leadership. … I think he has not lived up to his promises, the promises of having the passion and the drive for rooting out the scourge of sexual violence,” she told me. “I don’t think that he has lived up to my expectations.”

Dealing with these external pressures might actually be easier than the internal challenges. All second-term secretaries are forced to confront a brain drain, but Hagel is finding that replacing outgoing staffers is an especially tall order for a Pentagon bracing for a future of tightening budgets and diminishing influence. The departure of Carter, Hagel’s highly regarded deputy secretary, doesn't come as a surprise given that Carter had been passed over for the top job. But clearly there was friction; he had agitated, with little success, for Hagel to take a more active role in foreign policy, according to people close to both men. When Hagel’s team quietly reached out to Flournoy about her interest—the former Pentagon policy planning chief who left the administration after also being short-listed for the secretary job—she politely declined the offer, according to three people familiar with the situation. Lesser-known Robert Work, a 60-year-old former undersecretary of the Navy, is now considered the top candidate but Hagel was still interviewing other officials as recently as last week, according to administration officials.

Hagel has had similar problems filling the department’s vacated top policy post. Over the past month, Hagel’s team has reportedly gauged the interest of several candidates, including Kurt Campbell, a former top State Department official who co-founded (with Flournoy) the Center for a New American Security. Another prominent think-tanker, Kathleen Hicks of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, also took a pass. “To some extent you are seeing the Clinton effect,” says a former defense official who served under President Bill Clinton and recently turned down a Pentagon job offer. “Why take the risks of working in a second Obama administration, when you can make $300,000 in the private sector and then go work for Hillary?”

Of course Hagel’s greatest challenge may be figuring out the insider game in an administration known for aggregating national security power in the West Wing. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a hawk who admires Hagel’s independence, says he would be wise to emulate his predecessor, Panetta, a sharp-elbowed bureaucratic infighter with an avuncular public image. “Chuck needs to pick up where Panetta left off … fight ’em from the inside. … If he’s not following Leon’s lead, he’s making a big mistake.”

Hagel seems to be moving in that direction. He has butted heads with Burwell, the OMB director, over how she is pitching the impact of the cuts to Congress, pressing her to illustrate more vividly—district-by-district—the effects that defense cuts would have on members of Congress. And he has quietly made the case to McDonough and others that they need to take a more active role in bipartisan budget negotiations being run by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), at a time when most of Obama’s attention has been occupied by meltdown of Obamacare. Hagel has also taken a few less conventional steps, meeting last month with Tina Tchen, Michelle Obama’s chief of staff, in an effort to convince the first lady that Pentagon cuts will hit military families hardest. Meanwhile, Hagel has upped his public profile, sitting for a series of mostly gaffe-free interviews with foreign policy reporters and delivering speeches suggesting, ever so subtly, that he won’t remain silent if Obama allows the sequester cuts to go through.

But critics wonder if Hagel will directly challenge Obama, whom he befriended in the Senate at a time when the Illinois freshman knew next to nothing about foreign or military affairs. Even Hagel’s allies aren’t sure entirely how committed he is to holding the line on budget cuts, or even what that line is. He raised eyebrows among Senate Democrats in November by telling Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), “I don’t have money, but I can handle that,” during a phone conversation—which they read as a “sign of weakness,” in the words of one Democratic senator who told me about it.

Republicans, clearly relishing the travails of a turncoat, are less charitable. “The first thing he’s got to do is confront the political team in the White House which is … asserting too much influence over policy decisions,” says Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), an Armed Services Committee member and one of 27 Senate Republicans to oppose Hagel’s confirmation. “I just think it’s his duty to speak the truth to the president and stand up, and you can’t just always continue in office if you are asked to execute a policy that you truly believe is harmful. You have to make up your mind if you should stay or leave.”

If his own history is any guide, Hagel isn’t about to rip off his stripes in protest. “He’s not going anywhere,” said a senior administration official close to the secretary. Yet it’s hard not to hear a 1980s-vintage Republican strain in Hagel’s recent public utterances on the need to maintain a robust defense, and he has become increasingly fond of invoking another president, the first one for whom he ever worked.

“President Reagan understood the importance of the readiness of our defense enterprise,” Hagel—who helped run the Gipper’s Nebraska operation in 1980—told his audience at the Reagan Library last month. “President Reagan inherited a military that was still grappling with the legacy of the Vietnam War. … [He] began the rebuilding of America's military readiness and capabilities. But it took leadership, it took time and it took resources.”

defense,Washington Times,2,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/feb/24/patrick-shanahan-acting-defense-secretary-floats-w/,Pentagon chief floats 'wholesale redesign' of U.S. border security,2019-02-24,Robert Burns,"EL PASO , Texas — Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said Saturday after visiting the U.S.-Mexico border that the government needs a broader , more effective approach to border control . He suggested the Pentagon might contribute with its expertise in surveillance and monitoring .
“ How do we get out of treating the symptoms and get at the root of the issue , ” Shanahan said in an interview while flying back to Washington .
Considering how the military could reinforce efforts to block drug smuggling and other illegal activity comes as the Pentagon weighs diverting billions of dollars for President Donald Trump ’ s border wall .
Shanahan said he was not volunteering the Pentagon to take over any part of border control , which is the responsibility of the Department of Homeland Security . But he said his visit led him to question whether there should be a “ wholesale redesign ” of the way border control is done by the federal government .
Shanahan said the Pentagon is willing to continue supporting the DHS but wants to see a longer-term solution .

He suggested the Pentagon might contribute with its expertise in surveillance and monitoring.

“How do we get out of treating the symptoms and get at the root of the issue,” Shanahan said in an interview while flying back to Washington.

Considering how the military could reinforce efforts to block drug smuggling and other illegal activity comes as the Pentagon weighs diverting billions of dollars for President Donald Trump’s border wall.

Shanahan said he was not volunteering the Pentagon to take over any part of border control, which is the responsibility of the Department of Homeland Security. But he said his visit led him to question whether there should be a “wholesale redesign” of the way border control is done by the federal government.

Shanahan said the Pentagon is willing to continue supporting the DHS but wants to see a longer-term solution.

“I don’t want to just add resources and not fix the problem,” he said.

The Pentagon, for example, has agreed to temporarily provide active-duty troops to operate Border Patrol vehicles whose cameras can surveil wide areas along the border. Shanahan said this will free up the Border Patrol to do other important aspects of their mission. He said this is a function that could be developed more fully with the benefit of decades of U.S. military experience with ground and aerial reconnaissance and surveillance around the world.

The pedestrian fencing would include detection systems that could alert border patrol agents when someone is attempting to damage or break through the fencing. The money would come from the Pentagon’s drug interdiction programs.

One such project proposed by DHS, dubbed “El Paso Project 1,” includes segments of border west of El Paso, in Luna and Dona Ana counties, New Mexico. This is among areas DHS cites as known drug smuggling corridors used by Mexican cartels.

These projects are separate from, but related to, those which Shanahan is expected to pay for by diverting money that Congress appropriated for military construction projects.

UPDATE at 9:00 ET:

President Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama and White House staffers observed a moment of silence on the White House South Lawn to remember the nearly 3,000 people killed in terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.

After the silence, three bell tolls were struck and a bugler played taps.

Here's our earlier post:

Ceremonies to commemorate the nearly 3,000 people killed 11 years ago today in the worst-ever terrorist attacks on U.S. soil are decidedly lower key this time around.

At the National September 11 Memorial plaza in New York, a moment of silence will be observed at 8:47 a.m. ET to mark the time when the first plane struck the north tower at the World Trade Center, but The Wall Street Journal notes: ""no elected official will speak. Family members will read the names of the dead, accompanied by music, on the 9/11 memorial plaza between the waterfalls now marking footprints of the two towers.""

President Obama, the first lady and the White House staff will observe the moment of silence on the South Lawn. The president will later speak at the National 9/11 Pentagon Memorial and Vice President Joe Biden will attend a ceremony in Shanksville, Pa., where hijacked Flight 93 crashed.

The Associated Press reports:

""The neighborhood around ground zero seemed more normal than in previous years, with fewer police barricades and commuters rushing out of the subway.""

Last year's 10th anniversary saw the opening of the 9/11 Memorial. This year's ceremonies were to include the unveiling of the 9/11 Museum, but the project has been held up by a dispute between New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

The New York Times says: ""With work on the museum at a standstill for nearly a year, fundraising and donations have fallen, and exhibits are gathering dust in fabrication shops in Buffalo and Santa Fe, N.M., according to museum executives.""

However, Cuomo on Monday announced that an agreement that paves the way for finishing the $700 million project ""as soon as practicable,"" according to the AP.

Politics will take a pause. The president and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney will suspend their campaign for a day.

For much of President Barack Obama ’ s time in office , right-leaning foreign policy leaders have taken heart from his extension of key Bush policies . Obama has wound down both wars , but he also retained Bush ’ s last defense secretary , Robert Gates ; kept open the detention facility at Guantánamo Bay ; massively stepped up the use of drones and added troops to the war in Afghanistan before more recently drawing back .
While Obama has cast his administration as a clean break with the past , there has been much in his record for the right to like . Republicans even sought some credit for the killing of Osama bin Laden , arguing that Bush-backed interrogation tactics may have helped bring down the Al Qaeda kingpin .
The Hagel nomination is different — and may represent the president ’ s most dramatic turn away from the national security tenets of his predecessor .
At least on a symbolic level , Hagel represents a newly sharp break with the policies of the Bush administration , a clear rejection of Bush-style unilateralism and aggressiveness abroad . He has criticized proposals for using force against Iran , opposed Bush ’ s troop surge in Iraq , called for talks with Hamas and rejected little-challenged staples of foreign policy like the Cuba embargo .
If some liberals have criticized Obama for nominating a Republican with a questionable record on gay rights and climate change , others are touting his nomination as a delightfully blunt dismissal of the sacred cows of post-Sept. 11 conservative foreign policy .

Today , he ’ s being described both by conservative friends of Israel and a group loosely defined as neocons , as more on the left . ”
One Democratic foreign policy strategist cast the Hagel choice as a “ break from Bush-era thinking because it is a repudiation of the neoconservative movement . ”
“ He is the anti-neocon , ” the Democrat said , calling Hagel a throwback to a more moderate age of Republican foreign policy . “ The GOP has two security camps , right ?

Hagel ’ s camp doesn ’ t exist anymore ; they all switched teams . A repudiation of Bush ? Sure , but also a dramatic demonstration of how much Republican national security thinking has changed because of Bush . ”
Retired Gen. Wesley Clark , the former NATO supreme allied commander and Democratic presidential candidate , said the Hagel nomination wasn ’ t “ a particular push on an ideology , ” but suggested the right flank of the foreign policy community had gone out on a limb by attacking the nomination .
“ It was the kind of opposition that ’ s like a show of strength , by a group in the Republican Party who are associated with strong and conservative national security positions . OK , they ’ ve made their statement , ” Clark said . “ Now they ’ re going to have to deal with Sen. Hagel the man himself . ”

Of course , Obama didn ’ t choose Hagel as one final attack on his predecessor , nor has it taken Obama four years to turn the page on the Bush foreign policy in significant ways .

To the extent there ’ s a larger takeaway from the nomination , foreign policy veterans said it is likely the president has reached a point of confidence and comfort in the job that he wanted a genuine kindred spirit at the Department of Defense .
It ’ s only natural that a defense secretary choice who ’ s explicitly in line with Obama ’ s thinking would also represent an overt rejection of Bush , even if that nominee happened to serve in office as a Republican .
“ I see [ the nomination ] as Obama liberated from politics and confident in his own decision-making abilities now , too , choosing someone who he just genuinely likes and respects , ” said Brookings Institution scholar Michael O ’ Hanlon . “ And perhaps also Hagel ’ s reticence to use force is particularly useful in light of where the Iran — and Syria — files may go . ”
One former Republican Cabinet official offered this read on the Hagel nomination : “ It sends a message that Obama wants a guy who is not going to stand and fight on budget levels and wants to get out of Afghanistan as quickly as he does . ”
“ To me , he ’ s exactly the sort of person that I think Obama would pick , ” the Republican said . “ His problem is that he is seen by the Republicans as just a total opportunist who switched sides when it was in his own interests . Not that that ’ s anything new in Washington . ”

For much of President Barack Obama’s time in office, right-leaning foreign policy leaders have taken heart from his extension of key Bush policies. Obama has wound down both wars, but he also retained Bush’s last defense secretary, Robert Gates; kept open the detention facility at Guantánamo Bay; massively stepped up the use of drones and added troops to the war in Afghanistan before more recently drawing back.

While Obama has cast his administration as a clean break with the past, there has been much in his record for the right to like. Republicans even sought some credit for the killing of Osama bin Laden, arguing that Bush-backed interrogation tactics may have helped bring down the Al Qaeda kingpin.

The Hagel nomination is different — and may represent the president’s most dramatic turn away from the national security tenets of his predecessor.

( PHOTOS: The shortlist for Obama’s top jobs)

At least on a symbolic level, Hagel represents a newly sharp break with the policies of the Bush administration, a clear rejection of Bush-style unilateralism and aggressiveness abroad. He has criticized proposals for using force against Iran, opposed Bush’s troop surge in Iraq, called for talks with Hamas and rejected little-challenged staples of foreign policy like the Cuba embargo.

If some liberals have criticized Obama for nominating a Republican with a questionable record on gay rights and climate change, others are touting his nomination as a delightfully blunt dismissal of the sacred cows of post-Sept. 11 conservative foreign policy.

He is one of several top administration nominees facing roadblocks as Republicans demand to know more from President Obama on various topics , such as the Sept. 11 attacks on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi , Libya , and threaten to hold up his appointments as leverage .
Sen. Rand Paul , Kentucky Republican , said Wednesday that he would hold up Mr. Obama ’ s pick to head the CIA , John O. Brennan , until the White House releases more information about the secret drone execution program .
Democrats bristled at the delay over Mr. Hagel , accusing the Republicans of unprecedented obstructions .
“ This is the first time in the history of our country that a presidential nominee for secretary of defense has been filibustered , ” Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said Wednesday on the Senate floor . “ What a shame . But that ’ s the way it is . ”
Republicans said Mr. Reid was rushing Mr. Hagel ’ s nomination through the chamber and that there is a long history of filibustering nominations as a way to try to pry information loose .
“ We haven ’ t gotten the information that we want , ” said Sen. James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma , the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee .
Mr. Hagel , a former Republican senator whom Mr. Obama tapped to be his independent voice at the Defense Department , will need to muster 60 votes Friday or else his confirmation will be delayed until later this month .
He suffered through a rocky confirmation hearing two weeks ago , and Republicans said he has not disclosed all of the foreign clients for whom he has worked in the four years since he left the Senate .

Collins , Maine Republican .","Democrats pressed ahead Wednesday with Chuck Hagel’s nomination to be secretary of defense, scheduling a showdown vote for Friday even as top Republicans signaled that they need more information before confirming him for the Pentagon’s top civilian post.

He is one of several top administration nominees facing roadblocks as Republicans demand to know more from President Obama on various topics, such as the Sept. 11 attacks on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and threaten to hold up his appointments as leverage.

Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican, said Wednesday that he would hold up Mr. Obama’s pick to head the CIA, John O. Brennan, until the White House releases more information about the secret drone execution program.

Democrats bristled at the delay over Mr. Hagel, accusing the Republicans of unprecedented obstructions.

“This is the first time in the history of our country that a presidential nominee for secretary of defense has been filibustered,” Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said Wednesday on the Senate floor. “What a shame. But that’s the way it is.”

Republicans said Mr. Reid was rushing Mr. Hagel’s nomination through the chamber and that there is a long history of filibustering nominations as a way to try to pry information loose.

“We haven’t gotten the information that we want,” said Sen. James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee.

Mr. Hagel, a former Republican senator whom Mr. Obama tapped to be his independent voice at the Defense Department, will need to muster 60 votes Friday or else his confirmation will be delayed until later this month.

He suffered through a rocky confirmation hearing two weeks ago, and Republicans said he has not disclosed all of the foreign clients for whom he has worked in the four years since he left the Senate.

Freshman Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican, made a plea for that information, wondering at Tuesday’s committee meeting whether Mr. Hagel might have taken money from governments that aren’t friendly to the U.S.

“We do not know, for example if he received compensation for giving paid speeches at extreme or radical groups,” he said Tuesday.

“I’m looking for an answer,” Mr. McCain said, specifically on “where the president was that night and what he did.”

Mr. McCain would not disclose whether he plans to block a vote on the nomination if Mr. Obama does not supply the information he wants.

“I’ll cross that bridge when I come to it,” he told reporters outside the Senate chamber. “My position right now is I want answers to the questions.”

“The president needs to have a secretary of defense in whom he has trust, who will give him unvarnished advice, a person of integrity and one who has a personal understanding of the consequences of decisions relative to the use of military force,” Mr. Levin said on the Senate floor.

They beat him up for months — in TV ads, in op-ed pages and in Congress, with delay after delay before his confirmation on Tuesday.

But now that Chuck Hagel is set to take the top job at the Pentagon on Wednesday, many of his Senate opponents seemed ready to mend fences just hours after trying to derail him. As Hagel’s confirmation cleared the Senate floor 58 to 41, key Republican opponents who tried to wreck his nomination were already engaged in the Washington ritual of trying to make nice with their opponent after spending weeks opposing him.

“I like Chuck,” said Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama — who once said he had “dramatic concern” about Hagel’s opposition to nuclear weapons and voted against him on Tuesday. “I’ve been reluctant to criticize him, but I did disagree with some of his policy positions. He went through a tough confirmation, was asked appropriate questions … I would think that personalities won’t be a problem.”

“It is my hope … that he will sit down with everyone on the committee, and that we do what’s best for our Department of Defense going forward,” Ayotte said.

And Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who signed a letter urging Hagel to withdraw, and said Hagel might embolden Iran and endanger the U.S.’s relationship with Israel, said he hoped Hagel would prove him wrong.

“I hope he exceeds expectations,” Graham said. “It would be great for the country. Sen. Hagel has a challenge to prove to people that he’s up for the job.”

For his part, Hagel pledged cooperation after his grueling battle for confirmation.

“I will work closely with Congress to ensure that we maintain the strongest military in the world and continue to protect this great nation,” he said in a statement.

Still, not everyone was eager to bury the hatchet.

It's the largest expansion for the National Park Service in decades

While the bill had bipartisan support, it underwent some turbulence by conservatives

Tucked inside the defense authorization bill that the Senate passed Friday was an unrelated public lands package that's set to bring the biggest expansion to the National Park Service in decades.

Despite some conservative opposition—a chorus that skewered the legislation as a pork-barrel land grab—the measure also establishes thousands of acres of new wilderness areas. The bill designates seven sites as official national park units, many of which place a special emphasis on history, such as Manhattan Project work sites in New Mexico, Tennessee and Washington State.

Sites in New York related to Harriet Tubman's life will be added as a park unit, and parts of the Underground Railroad in Maryland will be formally named a part of the National Park Service. Tule Springs Fossil Beds outside of Las Vegas is set to become a national monument, preserving its thousands of fossils that show traces of Ice Age mammoths, bison, and American lions.

""This legislation clearly demonstrates that Congress and the administration are making national parks a national priority,"" said Clark Bunting, president of National Parks Conservation Association.

The legislation also expands nine national park sites—such as the Apostle Islands, Oregon Caves National Monument, and Gettysburg National Military Park—and extends funding for 15 national heritage areas.

All told, roughly 120,000 acres will be newly managed by the park service, and the number of official park units will jump from 401 to 408.

That many acres may not sound like a lot - Alaska's Denali National Park alone is six million acres - but it's the single largest package of park units approved since an omnibus parks bill in 1978 that authorized 14 new units.

In addition to new park units, the bill also establishes 245,000 acres of new wilderness land, nearly half of which was already being managed by federal employees.

While the bill passed with bipartisan support, it did not come without drama. Thirty-two Republicans voted against the defense authorization package in the House last week, in part because of its inclusion of park and wilderness provisions.

On the Senate side, just hours before the final vote on Friday, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, took to the floor to call for the public lands provisions to be stripped from the defense bill, saying the expansion was a ""disastrous idea"" because any new funding needs to go towards improving the current parks system.

""Our parks are falling apart. There's $12 billion backlog on our most pristine, greatest national monuments and parks,"" he said, referring to the National Park Service's coffers. ""We should preserve what we've already invested in.""

Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, argued in a floor speech Wednesday that drafters of the legislation ""egregiously"" forced the public lands provisions in the package through a ""distorted legislative process.""

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, called it an ""extreme"" land grab and urged the House and Senate not to pass it. ""With the military's shrinking budget, it is offensive that this bill would be used to fund congressional pork,"" he said in a statement last week.

Kristen Brengel, senior director of legislation and policy, at the NPCA, argued that much of the parks land is already owned by the government and is merely changing management.

Mr. Obama said in a “ signing statement ” late Wednesday that he agrees with the “ vast majority ” of provisions in the 680-page law . But he added , “ I do not agree with them all. ” He earlier had issued a veto threat to Congress if some of the objectionable provisions in the bill survived .
In spite of many veto threats in his first term , Mr. Obama has vetoed only two bills , both relatively inconsequential measures .
When he ran for the presidency in 2008 , Mr. Obama criticized President George W. Bush for the Republican ’ s use of signing statements , arguing that Mr. Bush too often was ignoring the will of Congress .
The president said in his new message that he objects to Section 1027 of the law , which renews the prohibition against transferring terror detainees from the Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba to the United States for any purpose .
“ I continue to oppose this provision , which substitutes the Congress ’ s blanket political determination for careful and fact-based determinations , made by counterterrorism and law enforcement professionals , of when and where to prosecute Guantanamo detainees , ” Mr. Obama wrote . “ This provision would , under certain circumstances , violate constitutional separation of powers principles . In the event that these statutory restrictions operate in a manner that violates constitutional separation of powers principles , my administration will implement them in a manner that avoids the constitutional conflict . ”
The issue of transferring detainees to the U.S. mainland has been a point of contention almost since the beginning of Mr. Obama ’ s presidency , when he served notice that he intended to close the detention center . Lawmakers in both parties have objected to earlier administration plans , since abandoned , to hold trials for some terrorism suspects in the U.S .
Mr. Obama , who ended the military ’ s long-standing “ don ’ t ask , don ’ t tell ” policy , also cited as “ unnecessary and ill-advised ” a provision in the law that gives service members and military chaplains the legal right to oppose homosexuality and the gay lifestyle as long as their opposition does not interfere with good order and discipline in the military .
“ The military already appropriately protects the freedom of conscience of chaplains and service members , ” Mr. Obama said . “ My administration remains fully committed to continuing the successful implementation of the repeal of ‘ don ’ t ask , don ’ t tell , ’ and to protecting the rights of gay and lesbian service members . ”
The president also said he objects to a provision that blocks proposed increases in health insurance fees for service members . He said it could result in deeper cuts to military personnel .
The Defense Department has proposed significant increases in Tricare fees for working-age retirees and their families , but the new law blocked that effort , limiting fee increases to the increase in the cost of living .
“ By failing to allow some of these cost savings measures , the Congress may force reductions in the overall size of our military forces , ” Mr. Obama said .
The bill also tightens penalties on Iran and beefs up security at U.S. diplomatic posts after the deadly attack in Benghazi , Libya , last September .
In spite of his veto threat , Mr. Obama said he signed the law because “ the need to renew critical defense authorities and funding was too great to ignore . ”

Mr. Carter has questioned the administration ’ s strategy in dealing with the Islamic State , also known as ISIL and ISIS , making candid remarks last month when he publicly questioned the ability and drive of the Iraqi forces . Arming and training Iraqi forces is the centerpiece of President Obama ’ s strategy in the Middle East as the administration remains resolute in not committing U.S. boots on the ground despite the deteriorating situation .
In addition to losing Mosul last year , the Iraqi forces gave up Ramadi last month .
“ What apparently happened is the Iraqi forces just showed no will to fight , ” Mr. Carter said on CNN ’ s “ State of the Union ” in May . “ They were not outnumbered ; in fact , they vastly outnumbered the opposing force . That says to me , and I think to most of us , that we have an issue with the will of the Iraqis to fight ISIL and defend themselves . ”
Mr. Carter ’ s remarks spurred anger among Iraqis , and Vice President Joseph R. Biden had to call Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to reassure him of U.S. support . In addition , the White House championed achievements made by Iraqi fighters in other parts of Iraq when asked about the comment at a press briefing the following week .
“ We have — and this is something that Secretary Carter has also discussed — we have seen a number of situations in which Iraqi Security Forces have performed well on the battlefield in the effort to retake Tikrit , ” White House spokesman Josh Earnest said . “ They demonstrated not just the will to fight , but important capabilities that allowed them to succeed on the battlefield . ”
This wasn ’ t the first time Mr. Carter seemed to undermine the White House ’ s narrative .
In February , during his confirmation hearing , Sen. John McCain , chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , asked Mr. Carter what he understood to be the White House ’ s strategy in combating the Islamic State , and Mr. Carter struggled to provide an answer — indicating to lawmakers the administration ’ s strategy was unclear .
“ I think the strategy connects ends and means , and our ends with respect to ISIL need to be its lasting defeat . I say lasting because , when they get defeated , it ’ s important they stay defeated , ” Mr. Carter said . “ That is why it is important that , uh , we have , uh , those on the ground there who will ensure they will stay defeated once defeated . ”
To which Mr. McCain , Arizona Republican , said it “ didn ’ t sound like a strategy ” to him .
Mr. Obama acknowledged Monday his administration and its international partners still don ’ t have a “ complete strategy ” for combating the terrorist group , and said it and the Pentagon were crafting a plan to better recruit , train and equip Iraqi Security Forces , who at times have been overrun by Islamic State militants .
Despite not being always in lockstep with the White House , it ’ s unlikely Mr. Carter will be pushed from his position like his predecessor , Chuck Hagel , the senator from Nebraska who reportedly fell out of favor with the White House as the Islamic State began to rise .
Mr. Carter is essentially guaranteed the job for the remainder of Mr. Obama ’ s tenure , since naming a new secretary is a lengthy , difficult process that would only give Republicans ammunition against Democrats in an election year , analysts say . Mr. Carter is the fourth secretary of defense in the Obama administration . President George W. Bush had two defense secretaries during his two terms , and President Clinton had three .
Others who have served under Mr. Obama recalled frustrations once safely out of office .
Leon E. Panetta , who served as defense secretary from 2011 to 2013 , blasted Mr. Obama in his memoir and subsequent interviews , saying the president had “ lost his way ” and “ created a vacuum ” for the Islamic State . Robert M. Gates , who also held the position , also wrote a book critical of the administration .
It was reported that Mr. Hagel was “ very , very frustrated ” as a member of the Obama Cabinet and its micromanagement , although Mr. Hagel hasn ’ t voiced his opinions since leaving the post this year .
While Mr. Carter would never intentionally step out and directly disagree with the president who nominated him , he will continue to publicly and clearly state his point of view and not cower to the White House , said Gordon Adams , a professor of foreign policy at American University .
“ Carter is an honest man , ” Mr. Adams said . His remarks regarding the Iraqis ’ will to fight may have been because Mr. Carter felt “ a signal needed to be sent to Iraqis that America ’ s patience was not unlimited , ” Mr. Adams said .
Not all of Mr. Obama ’ s top military advisers have been as forthright in speaking as openly and honestly about issues of national security as has Mr. Carter , said Mr. Adams . For former Obama administration secretaries Mr. Gates , Mr. Panetta and Mr. Hagel , that was just “ not the way they worked , ” he said .
Mr. Carter ’ s successful tenure as deputy secretary of defense paved the way to an easy confirmation in the Senate earlier this year . He offered opinions that weren ’ t exactly in line with the administration even before taking the job , testifying during his confirmation hearing that he supported providing lethal arms to Ukrainians fighting Russian separatists . He also promised to recommend changes if he thought they were necessary in the president ’ s exit strategy for Afghanistan .
Mr. Carter ’ s independent remarks during his confirmation hearing also drew the ire of the White House , with Mr . Earnest stating : “ Well , the other thing that I noticed that Dr. Carter mentioned in his hearing is that he ’ s a strong believer in the chain of command , and he certainly understands that the commander in chief is the top of that chain of command and that a decision like this will be made by the commander in chief . ”
Before taking the top job at the Pentagon , Mr. Carter was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University , served on the faculty at Harvard University ’ s John F. Kennedy School of Government and started out in the government in the Clinton administration , where he held an assistant secretary of defense position on international security .
Before serving as deputy secretary of defense from 2011 to 2013 , Mr. Carter served as an undersecretary of defense handling acquisitions , technology and logistics .
“ He is immensely open and honest by virtue of his background in academia , [ and ] he welcomes an open , passionate debate on issues , ” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal , Connecticut Democrat , who sits on the committee that confirmed Mr. Carter .
Sen. Claire McCaskill , Missouri Democrat and also a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , said that all the defense secretaries she ’ s worked with have been “ very honest with me , ” but that she is “ partial ” to Mr. Carter because of his commitment to reform contracting procedures in order to eliminate waste .
“ His background is as a geeky nerd [ who ] really has been in the weeds on contracting , and that ’ s been an area that I have been relentless about , ” she said . “ Ash Carter is probably the first defense secretary in history that has such a strong working knowledge in that area , so I ’ m a big fan because of that . ”
Mr. Carter ’ s candid critique of Iraqi troops at Ramadi is nothing but 12 years of frustration at the Iraqis ’ inability to step up finally bubbling over , said P.J . Crowley , a former State Department spokesman .
“ Ultimately the quality of the security forces — how well they ’ re led and how well the Baghdad government is able to regain over time the trust of the Sunni community in Iraq — these are things that the Iraqis have to do , ” said Mr. Crowley , who currently serves as a distinguished fellow at George Washington University . “ The circumstances in Ramadi where the Iraqi Security Forces retreated , despite outnumbering the aggressors , I ’ m certainly not surprised that Secretary Carter would be frustrated and would express that frustration . ”
Still , Mr. Carter hasn ’ t been a thorn in the side of the administration in all matters .
During his confirmation hearing he assured lawmakers he would not allow the White House to bully him into rapidly closing the U.S. military detention center at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
However , last week he told reporters he was working with the White House to submit a plan to close the center .
“ With respect to [ Guantanamo ] , I ’ m working with the White House to prepare a plan , which we ’ ll then submit , per longstanding request , to Congress , ” Mr. Carter told reporters , according to a report by Defense One . “ My own view is this is a very constructive step .

defense,Politico,0,http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/obamas-last-chance-on-defense-113340.html?hp=t3_r,Obama’s last chance on defense,2014-12-04,Dan Berman,"In his first six years in office , President Barack Obama hired three centrist defense secretaries whose credibility with the military and Congress shielded Obama from some of the blowback that struck the previous Democratic president , Bill Clinton .
But during that time , the White House took on a progressively greater role in setting defense policy , with two of Obama ’ s defense chiefs , Bob Gates and Leon Panetta , blaming Obama ’ s team for policy failures and interference . The third defense boss , Chuck Hagel , proved so unable to navigate the White House currents that he was let go without an obvious replacement .
Now , as Obama prepares to introduce his fourth defense chief , the Democratic thinker and policy-maker Ash Carter , the president ’ s own credibility on national security — and his relationship with the military — is on the line as never before .
Yet almost no one expects the White House to show any greater deference to the Pentagon than under Gates , Panetta or Hagel .
The White House isn ’ t looking for someone to send them strategy papers but to carry out the strategy the West Wing and National Security Council set and Carter ’ s well suited to that , former senior foreign policy officials say .
Carter ’ s strengths are that he knows the building — there won ’ t be a long “ get to know you ” period where he figures out how to navigate the Pentagon and develop relationships with the military . But he ’ s not shifting the balance of power back to the Pentagon .
“ This is clearly one of the most controlling foreign policy presidents , if not the most controlling , since Richard Nixon . This is a guy who dominates and doesn ’ t delegate , ” said former State Department official Aaron David Miller . “ You can ’ t fire the president . [ Secretary of State ] Kerry ’ s not going to quit and Susan Rice doesn ’ t seem to be going anywhere . ”
Added Anthony Cordesman of the centrist Center for Strategic and International Studies : “ Within a couple of weeks everything is going to depend on what is the personal relationship between the president and the secretary of defense . That ’ s particularly true at a time when in many ways cabinet officials seem to feel they have to talk directly to the president or be caught up in a national security process likely to become public and where there ’ s a lot of resistance and a lot of focus on the domestic agenda . ”
The White House is sensitive enough about complaints of undue interference that the White House press secretary , Josh Earnest , took pains this week to remind reporters that previous administrations had suffered from White House-Pentagon divisions as well .
“ I ’ m certainly not a scholar in this area but I do believe that if you sort of look back at previous administrations that there ’ s always some natural tension that exists between the Pentagon and the White House , ” Earnest said Monday . “ The president is , after all , the commander-in-chief , so he obviously has a significant say over what kinds of things are happening over at the Department of Defense . ”
But while previous presidents often embraced the role of military leader — with George W. Bush , for one , taking pains to identity himself as a “ wartime president ” — Obama , in seeking a contrast from the Bush years , has sought to downplay his role as a wartime leader . While that may have worked to his advantage earlier in his term , it ’ s led to a lack of public confidence in recent months , especially as the fight against ISIL ramped up .
In September , only 34 percent of Americans approved of the president ’ s handling of foreign policy issues , according to a CBS/New York Times poll .
That the White House didn ’ t have Hagel ’ s replacement ready to go only helps perpetuate the idea that it doesn ’ t have its act together when it comes to the military . The period between the public announcement of Hagel ’ s departure and the introduction of the new nominee dragged on longer than the officials wanted it to .
The nominee who emerged , Carter , is widely touted for his policy expertise and experience as deputy defense secretary , though he lacks a strong profile .
“ I think it [ the choice of Carter ] signals better management of the department than Chuck Hagel offered but no change in sweeping arrogance of the president ’ s closest policy advisers on national security , ” said Kori Schake NSC defense official and State Department official under George W. Bush .
Nonetheless , many former officials are waiting to see how Carter himself adjusts to his new position , and whether he develops the political skills to handle the White House better than his predecessors .
“ You have to carry yourself in a different way now that may not be personally comfortable to you but is what office requires , ” one former official said . “ He ’ s got to deal with the White House now in a different way than he did before . He may have been more buddy buddy but it ’ s got to be now ‘ I ’ m the Secretary of Defense , ’ and the respect has to come back to him from them rather than from him to them . ”
A lot will depend on whether Carter can build a strong team at the Pentagon , the former official said : “ Ash is going to need to build a front office comprised of people who can help him perform at his best — rather than people from the White House keeping watch over the department . ”
Lawrence Korb , a Reagan administration assistant defense secretary now at the Center for American Progress , noted that Carter lacks the leverage over the White House that Gates and even Panetta had . “ He didn ’ t have the gravitas to say , ‘ Before I take this job I want this , this and this to be assured , ’ ” said Korb . “ The people who ’ ve been successful secretaries are the ones who can say , ‘ if I take the job , this is what I want. ’ Gates had a lot of leverage with the president because he didn ’ t want the job , didn ’ t want to stay on . Panetta did too . ”
That doesn ’ t necessarily mean Carter is going to be a pushover .
“ I do not think the president is looking for a doormat for the next secretary of Defense , ” said Doug Wilson , assistant secretary of Defense for public affairs under Gates and Panetta . “ I think he ’ s looking for somebody to speak truth to power and to be able to work as a key member of the national security team on the development of policy and the implementation of policy . ”
Carter has enough experiences throughout the Pentagon to know how to work effectively there , Wilson said . He “ knows which buttons to push when . ”
That said , Carter must remember who has the last word .
“ They don ’ t call the person commander-in-chief because he ’ s going to take a vote and see which policy gets the most support from his aides , ” Wilson said . “ Ultimately , it ’ s the responsibility of the president as commander-in-chief to make the final decision ”","In his first six years in office, President Barack Obama hired three centrist defense secretaries whose credibility with the military and Congress shielded Obama from some of the blowback that struck the previous Democratic president, Bill Clinton.

But during that time, the White House took on a progressively greater role in setting defense policy, with two of Obama’s defense chiefs, Bob Gates and Leon Panetta, blaming Obama’s team for policy failures and interference. The third defense boss, Chuck Hagel, proved so unable to navigate the White House currents that he was let go without an obvious replacement.

Now, as Obama prepares to introduce his fourth defense chief, the Democratic thinker and policy-maker Ash Carter, the president’s own credibility on national security — and his relationship with the military — is on the line as never before.

Yet almost no one expects the White House to show any greater deference to the Pentagon than under Gates, Panetta or Hagel.

The White House isn’t looking for someone to send them strategy papers but to carry out the strategy the West Wing and National Security Council set and Carter’s well suited to that, former senior foreign policy officials say.

Carter’s strengths are that he knows the building — there won’t be a long “get to know you” period where he figures out how to navigate the Pentagon and develop relationships with the military. But he’s not shifting the balance of power back to the Pentagon.

“This is clearly one of the most controlling foreign policy presidents, if not the most controlling, since Richard Nixon. This is a guy who dominates and doesn’t delegate,” said former State Department official Aaron David Miller. “You can’t fire the president. [Secretary of State] Kerry’s not going to quit and Susan Rice doesn’t seem to be going anywhere.”

( Also on POLITICO: Carter's no yes-man for Obama)

Added Anthony Cordesman of the centrist Center for Strategic and International Studies: “Within a couple of weeks everything is going to depend on what is the personal relationship between the president and the secretary of defense. That’s particularly true at a time when in many ways cabinet officials seem to feel they have to talk directly to the president or be caught up in a national security process likely to become public and where there’s a lot of resistance and a lot of focus on the domestic agenda.”

The White House is sensitive enough about complaints of undue interference that the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, took pains this week to remind reporters that previous administrations had suffered from White House-Pentagon divisions as well.

“I’m certainly not a scholar in this area but I do believe that if you sort of look back at previous administrations that there’s always some natural tension that exists between the Pentagon and the White House,” Earnest said Monday. “The president is, after all, the commander-in-chief, so he obviously has a significant say over what kinds of things are happening over at the Department of Defense.”

But while previous presidents often embraced the role of military leader — with George W. Bush, for one, taking pains to identity himself as a “wartime president” — Obama, in seeking a contrast from the Bush years, has sought to downplay his role as a wartime leader. While that may have worked to his advantage earlier in his term, it’s led to a lack of public confidence in recent months, especially as the fight against ISIL ramped up.

In September, only 34 percent of Americans approved of the president’s handling of foreign policy issues, according to a CBS/New York Times poll.

“This man is an island,” Foreign Policy magazine declared.

That the White House didn’t have Hagel’s replacement ready to go only helps perpetuate the idea that it doesn’t have its act together when it comes to the military. The period between the public announcement of Hagel’s departure and the introduction of the new nominee dragged on longer than the officials wanted it to.

The nominee who emerged, Carter, is widely touted for his policy expertise and experience as deputy defense secretary, though he lacks a strong profile.

Carter has enough experiences throughout the Pentagon to know how to work effectively there, Wilson said. He “knows which buttons to push when.”

That said, Carter must remember who has the last word.

“They don’t call the person commander-in-chief because he’s going to take a vote and see which policy gets the most support from his aides,” Wilson said. “Ultimately, it’s the responsibility of the president as commander-in-chief to make the final decision”

The Pentagon has reassured allies of its ""ironclad"" security commitments, after President Donald Trump cancelled its Korean military exercises.

Mr Trump made the announcement after Tuesday's historic summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore.

The move is seen as a big concession to North Korea and appeared to take US allies in the region by surprise.

Meanwhile, North Korean state media said Mr Kim had accepted an offer from President Trump to visit the US.

KCNA news agency said Mr Kim had invited Mr Trump to visit Pyongyang ""at a convenient time"" and Mr Trump had also invited Mr Kim to the United States.

""The two top leaders gladly accepted each other's invitation,"" KCNA added.

He said the two countries ""should commit themselves to refraining from antagonising"" each other ""and take legal and institutional steps to guarantee it"", KCNA reported.

Politics turned upside down

Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter

Two years ago Barack Obama travelled to Cuba - and was roundly denounced by conservatives for breaking bread with totalitarian leaders and praised by liberals for his statesmanship. Now, with Donald Trump's summit with Kim Jong-un, the tables have been turned. Mostly.

On conservative Fox News and among Mr Trump's core supporters, the president was lauded for a historic diplomatic breakthrough. Among Democrats, there was more than a fair amount of concern that the president was engaging in a glorified publicity stunt with little chance of success.

Republicans in Congress have been more measured. There was plenty of talk of ""historic first steps"", in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's words, but concern over how the yet-to-be negotiated verification details will turn out.

Splitting along party lines , the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 14-11 on Tuesday to advance Chuck Hagel ’ s nomination after a tense two-hour meeting that closed the latest chapter in a weeks-long political saga .
The nomination heads to the full Senate , where Republicans may demand a 60-vote threshold in a vote expected later this week .
Democrats and Republicans broke sharply over whether the former Republican senator from Nebraska is the right man to run the Pentagon . Supporters cited Hagel ’ s experience as an enlisted soldier in Vietnam and his service in the Senate and elsewhere as reasons he should succeed Defense Secretary Leon Panetta while opponents stuck with their criticisms about Hagel ’ s past positions on Iran , Israel and the defense budget .
A few Republicans kept up their bid to stop Hagel ’ s nomination from moving ahead , arguing he has kept some information from the committee , but Democrats insisted that he has satisfied its disclosure requirements and accused Republicans of tarring Hagel unfairly .
Sen. Bill Nelson ( D-Fla. ) said Sen. Ted Cruz ( R-Texas ) had `` gone over the line '' and `` basically ... impugned the patriotism of the nominee ” by pointing out that the Iranian Foreign Ministry had praised Hagel .
The top Republican on the committee , Sen. Jim Inhofe ( R-Okla. ) , shot back later in defense of Cruz , `` You do n't get any cozier than that . ''
Former ranking member Sen. John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) interjected soon thereafter with a message for his colleagues : `` Sen. Hagel is an honorable man who has served his country , and no one on this committee at any time should impugn his character , '' McCain said .
But for most of the meeting , senators referred to Hagel ’ s late January confirmation hearing . McCain slammed Hagel ’ s performance as “ the worst I have seen of any nomination for office ” and said it was “ disturbing ” that Hagel would not directly respond to his question about whether the Iraq surge was a success . Democrats said the criticism of Hagel ’ s day in the spotlight was unfair , and they defended his description of a policy of “ containment ” for a nuclear Iran — which the White House does not support – as a simple slip of the tongue .
Apart from the politics involved with Hagel himself , Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin ( D-Mich. ) had warned senators that rejecting him would endanger the Pentagon at a time it could ill afford another complication .
“ If there ’ s a risk here , it is that the defeat of this nomination would leave the Department of Defense leaderless at a time when we face immense budgetary challenges and our military is engaged in combat operations overseas , '' Levin said .
While he acknowledged that many senators oppose President Barack Obama 's foreign policy , `` our vote on Sen. Hagel 's nomination will not change those policies . ''
The meeting ultimately proved civil compared with what might have been — Republican aides had suggested earlier that some GOP senators were considering walking out to protest what they called Hagel ’ s insufficient financial disclosures . Inhofe and Cruz later ruled that out .
“ I don ’ t think anything is gained by theatrics , ” Cruz told ███ .
Just the same , Republicans continued to try to put on the brakes . Louisiana Sen. David Vitter quarreled with Levin over what Vitter said was an incomplete disclosure from Hagel of past speeches , and Cruz renewed the GOP line of questioning about whether Hagel had taken payments from “ foreign sources . ”
Hagel ’ s nomination now proceeds to the Senate floor , where Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D-Nev. ) has said he hopes the chamber could vote on it Wednesday or Thursday .
Some Republicans said they might continue to oppose Hagel before the full Senate , but Reid responded with a single word on Tuesday when asked whether he ’ d honor an attempt at a hold : “ No . ”
With 55 Democrats controlling the Senate and two Republicans — Mike Johanns of Nebraska and Thad Cochran of Mississippi — already publicly supporting Hagel , only three more Republicans would need to support him for confirmation under a request from Republicans for a 60-vote threshold .

Splitting along party lines, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 14-11 on Tuesday to advance Chuck Hagel’s nomination after a tense two-hour meeting that closed the latest chapter in a weeks-long political saga.

The nomination heads to the full Senate, where Republicans may demand a 60-vote threshold in a vote expected later this week.

Democrats and Republicans broke sharply over whether the former Republican senator from Nebraska is the right man to run the Pentagon. Supporters cited Hagel’s experience as an enlisted soldier in Vietnam and his service in the Senate and elsewhere as reasons he should succeed Defense Secretary Leon Panetta while opponents stuck with their criticisms about Hagel’s past positions on Iran, Israel and the defense budget.

A few Republicans kept up their bid to stop Hagel’s nomination from moving ahead, arguing he has kept some information from the committee, but Democrats insisted that he has satisfied its disclosure requirements and accused Republicans of tarring Hagel unfairly.

Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) had ""gone over the line"" and ""basically ... impugned the patriotism of the nominee” by pointing out that the Iranian Foreign Ministry had praised Hagel.

The top Republican on the committee, Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), shot back later in defense of Cruz, ""You don't get any cozier than that.""

Former ranking member Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) interjected soon thereafter with a message for his colleagues: ""Sen. Hagel is an honorable man who has served his country, and no one on this committee at any time should impugn his character,"" McCain said.

But for most of the meeting, senators referred to Hagel’s late January confirmation hearing. McCain slammed Hagel’s performance as “the worst I have seen of any nomination for office” and said it was “disturbing” that Hagel would not directly respond to his question about whether the Iraq surge was a success. Democrats said the criticism of Hagel’s day in the spotlight was unfair, and they defended his description of a policy of “containment” for a nuclear Iran — which the White House does not support – as a simple slip of the tongue.

Apart from the politics involved with Hagel himself, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin (D-Mich.) had warned senators that rejecting him would endanger the Pentagon at a time it could ill afford another complication.

“If there’s a risk here, it is that the defeat of this nomination would leave the Department of Defense leaderless at a time when we face immense budgetary challenges and our military is engaged in combat operations overseas,"" Levin said.

While he acknowledged that many senators oppose President Barack Obama's foreign policy, ""our vote on Sen. Hagel's nomination will not change those policies.""

The meeting ultimately proved civil compared with what might have been — Republican aides had suggested earlier that some GOP senators were considering walking out to protest what they called Hagel’s insufficient financial disclosures. Inhofe and Cruz later ruled that out.

“I don’t think anything is gained by theatrics,” Cruz told POLITICO.

Just the same, Republicans continued to try to put on the brakes. Louisiana Sen. David Vitter quarreled with Levin over what Vitter said was an incomplete disclosure from Hagel of past speeches, and Cruz renewed the GOP line of questioning about whether Hagel had taken payments from “foreign sources.”

Hagel’s nomination now proceeds to the Senate floor, where Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has said he hopes the chamber could vote on it Wednesday or Thursday.

Some Republicans said they might continue to oppose Hagel before the full Senate, but Reid responded with a single word on Tuesday when asked whether he’d honor an attempt at a hold: “No.”

With 55 Democrats controlling the Senate and two Republicans — Mike Johanns of Nebraska and Thad Cochran of Mississippi — already publicly supporting Hagel, only three more Republicans would need to support him for confirmation under a request from Republicans for a 60-vote threshold.

Inhofe said Monday night that he would not use his privilege to delay Hagel’s confirmation into the weekend or early next week, so long as Democrats produced 60 votes upfront to support Hagel.

David Petraeus ' resignation was not linked to the September attack that killed four Americans in Benghazi , Libya , and he never passed classified information to the woman he was having an affair with , the former CIA director told an HLN journalist .
`` In our first conversation , '' Kyra Phillips , from CNN 's sister network HLN , said Thursday , Petraeus `` had told me he had engaged in something dishonorable . He sought to do the honorable thing in response -- and that was to come forward . He was very clear that he screwed up terribly ... even felt fortunate to have a wife who is far better than he deserves . ''
Phillips , who has interviewed Petraeus in war zones , initially reached out to him to express shock at the news of the affair that derailed a highly decorated career in the military and CIA .
Among other things , Petraeus said he has not talked with Paula Broadwell , his biographer and the woman with whom he had an affair , since the scandal broke .

`` He insisted to me that he has never passed classified information to Paula Broadwell , '' Phillips said . `` He said this has nothing to do with Benghazi , and he wants to testify . He will testify . ''
Petraeus is expected to appear Friday before the House and Senate intelligence committees , aiming to clear up `` a lot of misrepresentations of what he told Congress initially '' about who was behind the attack , a source who has spoken with him said .
Meanwhile , the `` general conduct '' of Petraeus is the focus of a new investigation launched by the CIA 's inspector general , said CIA spokesman Preston Golson said .
Among other aspects , this inquiry will explore whether Petraeus used CIA resources in carrying out his affair with Broadwell , a U.S. official said .
In his first public comments on the matter , Attorney General Eric Holder said Thursday that Justice Department officials did not tell the White House about related FBI investigations -- including looking into possible breaches of top-secret information -- because it was determined national security was never at risk .
`` Had we made the determination that a threat to national security existed , we would of course have made that known to the president and appropriate members on ( Capitol ) Hill , '' Holder told reporters in New Orleans . `` But as we went through the investigation ... we felt very secure in the knowledge that a national security threat did not exist . ''
The former CIA chief did n't try to persuade his bosses to let him keep his job once he admitted the affair , and `` has maintained to me all along this was a personal failing , '' Phillips said .
The extramarital relationship ended months ago . But it continues to make waves in Washington , as suspicions ripple through the capital about the timing of its revelation and Petraeus ' scheduled testimony into the Benghazi attack .
In addition , the chain of fiery e-mails that led the FBI to discover the sexual indiscretion has caused collateral damage , putting the imminent nomination of Gen. John Allen as NATO commander on hold , until the nature of his e-mail exchange and relationship with a military `` socialite '' have been clarified .
The FBI investigation was triggered by Frederick Humphries , a veteran agent for the Tampa FBI field office , who is a friend of Jill Kelley , said Lawrence Berger , general counsel for the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association .
Kelley , who was a volunteer at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida , contacted Humphries about anonymous e-mails that questioned her character , a U.S. official and a source close to Kelley said .
Humphries took the information on the e-mails to the `` appropriate components , '' Berger said . `` He reported it to the proper channels and had no further part in the case . ''
Asked about reports that Humphries pestered the agents assigned to the case for information , Berger said that was n't true .
`` I do n't accept that . He followed proper protocols , '' he said .
However , the FBI is reviewing Humphries ' actions , a law enforcement official said . The agency will look at whether Humphries followed proper procedures in speaking to some members of Congress about his concerns about how the FBI was handling Kelley 's case .
The review will include a look at whether the agent went through the proper chain of command at the FBI to raise his concerns , the official said . Humphries is still on duty in the Tampa office .
Reports by officials familiar with the e-mail messages between Kelley and Allen give conflicting impressions about their potentially inappropriate nature -- with one U.S. official saying `` John Allen would be very embarrassed by them '' and a senior official close to the general saying they do n't point to a sexual or romantic relationship .
That Allen remains in command in Afghanistan suggests that there is no criminal issue , a U.S. official told CNN . But the official said the Defense Department 's inspector general could still find evidence of criminal conduct .
The investigation into the e-mails connected to Allen and Kelley led to the discovery of the affair between Petraeus , 60 , and Broadwell , 40 .
The fallout has been widespread , but there are signs that the FBI investigation is winding down , said CNN contributor Tom Fuentes , a former FBI assistant director .
There is no indication of criminal activity on the part of Petraeus or that he disclosed classified information , senior federal law enforcement officials told Fuentes .
Kelley hosted top military brass at her home , but it 's unclear if Allen or Petraeus were aware that her family was experiencing financial difficulties or of the unusual background of a charity they founded .
Public records show that in April 2010 , about six years after the Kelleys bought their $ 1.5 million home , Regions Bank filed to foreclose on the property , saying the couple had n't made a mortgage payment since September 2009 .

The charity 's money paid for parties , transportation , legal bills and other administrative costs . There is no evidence any of the money was used for cancer research or caring for cancer patients .
Asked for the Kelleys ' side of the story , a source close to the family told CNN the source did n't have enough information to respond .
It appears unlikely that Broadwell would face prosecution in the case , a senior law enforcement official said .
Officials continued to review materials taken from her home , and the FBI needed a presumption that there were classified materials there when they obtained a search warrant . But it appears that any violations of releasing classified information appear not to be egregious .
Before the warrant was issued , FBI agents approached high-level Pentagon officials to ask them if material they had tied to Broadwell could be considered classified , two U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the case said . Defense Department officials said they were classified .
As a military reservist , Broadwell had security clearance but presumably would have no clear reason to have classified information in her home , the officials said . The military has many safeguards in place , including not allowing data to be saved on hard drives and restricting what can be sent out by e-mail , to prevent secret info from getting out .
Broadwell 's security clearance with the government has since been suspended , pending the outcome of the investigation , said the officials .

""Was this China or Russia trying to do something or has some propulsion system we are not familiar with?"", they said.

Earlier this year, the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) released millions of pages of declassified documents online.

The records included UFO sightings and a collection of reports on flying saucers.

Two of every three swing voters say the Pentagon should postpone plans to accept “ transgender ” people who are trying to live as members of the opposite sex , according to the new poll by Rasmussen Reports .
Defense Secretary James Mattis explained his July 30 decision to delay Obama ’ s plan for six months , just before it was to begin operating :
Since becoming the Secretary of Defense , I have emphasized that the Department of Defense must measure each policy decision against one critical standard : will the decision affect the readiness and lethality of the force ?

It is against this standard that I provide the following guidance on the way forward in accessing transgender individuals into the military Services .
The six-month delay will encourage and help opponents lobby against Obama ’ s pro-transgender policy .
Throughout 2016 , Obama used his power as president to push schools and other institutions to support the claim by transgender activists that people have a hidden “ gender identity ” which is independent of their sex and biology . These advocates also say that a person ’ s sex is determined by their “ gender identity , ” not their male-or-female body . In turn , the advocates demand that the federal government force Americans to accept the sex-switching “ gender identity ” claims made by each person , regardless of scientific data about genetics , biology and the variety of normal behavior and appearances shown by normal women and men .
Transgender activists were furious about Mattis ’ last-minute decision to block Obama ’ s directive , which would have resulted in a de-facto endorsement of the transgender ideology by the most respected government institution in the nation .
“ For the past year , transgender troops have been serving openly … stonewalling on full inclusion will , just like ‘ don ’ t ask , don ’ t tell , ’ compromise military readiness , ” said a statement from the pro-transgender Palm Center in California .
Obama ’ s proposal is widely opposed , in part , because it would require soldiers to share bathrooms and shower facilities with people of the opposite sex , and would require the U.S. military pay for the expensive procedures — such as hormones and perhaps surgery — used by people trying to live as members of the opposite sex .
The military ’ s most famous transgender recruit , now named Chelsea Manning , was recently freed from military jail on Obama ’ s orders . When serving in Iraq , Manning illegally copied a huge haul of military records and videos and released them to the world .
The Rasmussen poll was published just before the Pentagon announcement .

The cross-tabs , however , showed that GOP supporters split 60 percent for a delay and 23 percent opposition to a delay . Democrats split 33 percent for a delay and 44 percent opposition to a delay .
Importantly , 52 percent of the swing-voting independents back a delay , while only 25 percent oppose a delay — and 23 percent declined to comment . That is a two-to-one preference among swing-voters for delay , and most of the no-comment voters likely favor a delay also .
Among self-described conservatives , 64 percent want a delay , while only 22 percent oppose a delay . Self-described “ moderates ” split 42 percent for a delay , 35 percent opposed a delay .
The questions about a “ delay ” – instead of outright opposition — offered voters some opportunity to show opposition to the media-favored transgender agenda while protecting themselves from claims of bigotry .
That worry was clearly visible in a prior Rasmussen question , which asked likely voters whether the decision to allow transgender people into the military is good or bad for the military .
Twenty-three percent said transgenders are good for the military — including just 32 percent of Democrats . Thirty-one percent said transgenders are bad for the military — but only 16 percent of liberals .

House Republicans on Wednesday night abruptly pulled their first spending bill of the year off the floor after it became clear that a bipartisan amendment to strike part of a multibillion-dollar Pentagon budget increase might actually pass.

Leadership just after 8 p.m. canceled late-night votes on an appropriations bill funding military construction projects and the Veterans Affairs Department and will roll them to Thursday at the earliest, according to a GOP House leadership aide.

Another Republican House leadership staffer downplayed the problem, saying Republicans just wanted to give members time to think about how they’d vote on the issue.

But the move shows Republicans aren’t sure they have the votes to defeat the amendment, which would eliminate part of a Defense Department boost that is essential to getting defense hawks to support the party’s annual spending blueprint.

And it’s not a good sign for the appropriations process overall. The spending bill pulled from the floor is generally one of the least controversial and easiest to pass.

So much for that.

The crux of the problem Wednesday night was a provision cooked up odd bedfellows: ultra-conservative Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.) and liberal Democrat Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.). Their amendment would strike from the bill about $530 million worth of funding for military construction projects that’s drawn from a controversial source.

The underlying measure draws the money from a $38 billion spending increase funneled to the Pentagon through a war funding account known as the Overseas Contingency Operations account. The OCO is supposed to pay for operations in the Middle East, but this year it became a back door for Republicans to boost general Pentagon spending to appease defense hawks.

“There is clearly bipartisan opposition to using the Overseas Contingency Operations budget as a slush fund for non-war related projects,” said Van Hollen, who has consistently criticized using OCO for day-to-day operations. “I will continue to work with Congressman Mulvaney and my other colleagues to fight against this abuse of the budget process.”

A House GOP leadership source said lawmakers will now vote on the budget deal Thursday and continue appropriations work only after that is dispensed with. This would buy the leadership time time to whip votes, should they choose to.

Republicans are keenly interested in passing spending bills and conferencing them with the Senate this year now that they control both chambers.

But they clearly still have a tightrope to walk. Fiscal hawks think the OCO spending should be offset, while liberals accused Republicans of engaging in budget gimmicks. If the two continue to band together, they could unravel future spending bills.

Defense hawks have spent the day focusing on their own Pentagon authorizations, so the amendment may come as a surprise. They’ll be a crucial part of whipping support to defeat the provision, presenting leadership with its first big appropriations test that is unlikely to be the last.",www.politico.com,left,epVNzOPUEjNeQkU8

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON -- An Illinois Army guardsman and his cousin, both accused of pledging to wage war on behalf of the Islamic State of Iraq, were arrested and charged as part of an alleged conspiracy to support the terrorist group, federal prosecutors said.

One of the suspects, Illinois Army National Guard Specialist Hasan Edmonds, 22, was arrested late Wednesday night at Chicago's Midway International Airport where he was allegedly preparing to travel to Syria through Cairo to join ISIL's cause.

The other man, Jonas Edmonds, 29, also was arrested Wednesday night at his home in Aurora, Ill., after allegedly telling an undercover FBI agent that he had planned to attack an Illinois military post where Hasan Edmonds had trained. The alleged intent, Jonas Edmonds said, was to kill up to 150 people sometime after his cousin left for Syria.

Charges involving the guardsman represent the second time in less than a week that a suspect with U.S. military ties was linked to an ISIL support case.

A New Jersey Air Force veteran was charged last week with attempting to join ISIL after being turned back by Turkish authorities from an alleged planned entry to Syria.

As recently as Tuesday, the two Illinois suspects and the undercover agent drove to the military post where Edmonds had trained. During the trip, Hasan Edmonds allegedly described the interior of the installation and ""which rooms they should avoid during the attack,'' according to court records.

""Hasan Edmonds also entered the installation and retrieved a military training schedule, which he then gave to Jonas Edmonds,'' the records state.

Since late last year, according to the charging documents, the two suspects repeatedly expressed their allegiance to ISIL in communications with at least two undercover agents who first engaged them through social media.

""I am already in the american kafir (infidel) army ... and now I wish only to serve in the army of Allah alongside my true brothers,'' Hasan Edmonds allegedly wrote in a January e-mail to one of the undercover agents. ""I pray to just one time step foot in the land ruled by the Law of the Quran but I am content to fight and die here in the cause of Allah whenever the target is set and the order is given.''

In a separate communication later the same month, Hasan Edmonds allegedly told the undercover agent that the ""hardest'' part of their planning effort was ""staying under the radar.''

In an apparent reference to the risk posed by undercover government agents, he added: ""Here, they hide and some even pretend to be friends ... We'd like to cause as much damage and mayhem as possible before being granted shahada (martyrdom).''

Both suspects made their initial appearances in a Chicago federal court Thursday afternoon. Their attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.

Chicago U.S. Attorney Zachary Fardon pledged an aggressive prosecution, citing ISIL's ""agenda of ruthless violence.''

""Anyone who threatens to harm our citizens and allies, whether abroad or here at home, will face the full force of justice,'' Fardon said.

""Distrubingly,'' said Assistant Attorney General John Carlin, who directs the Justice Department's National Security Division, ""one of the defendants currently wears the same uniform of those they allegedly planned to attack.''

In a move that lifted the cloak ever so slightly , the White House this week issued a statement objecting to the House ’ s fiscal year 2013 intelligence-policy bill , saying it misses some good chances to cut spending and save money .
But what those savings are and what the rest of the money is going toward are kept shrouded .
“ The administration objects to unrequested authorizations for some classified programs that were reduced in the president ’ s budget because they are lower in priority and would support deficit-reduction efforts , ” the White House said in a vague statement .
The House rejected the administration ’ s concerns , passing the bill by an overwhelming 386-28 vote after making minor tweaks , all with unanimous support .
A few details about the bill are known : While it spends more than the president wanted , it reduces spending 4 percent compared with 2012 — though both years ’ dollar amounts remain classified .
The bill keeps personnel costs static in 2013 , but does put money into stepping up surveillance of foreign spies .
While this year ’ s spending isn ’ t yet known , the government has released a top-line figure for 2011 , when the government spent $ 24 billion on military intelligence programs and an additional $ 54.6 billion on civilian programs such as the CIA , for a total of $ 78.6 billion .
That was the first drop in years , according to the Federation of American Scientists , which tracks the numbers . It said civilian intelligence grew $ 1.5 billion from 2010 to 2011 , but military intelligence programs dropped by $ 3 billion , for a net drop of $ 1.5 billion .
The reason for the drop , like so much else in this debate , is unclear , said Steven Aftergood , a senior analyst at the federation .
There is reportedly plenty of waste and overlap . After an exhaustive investigation , The Washington Post reported in 2010 that “ 51 federal organizations and military commands , operating in 15 U.S. cities , track the flow of money to and from terrorist networks . ”
In a report accompanying this week ’ s bill , lawmakers on the House intelligence committee , which wrote the legislation , said they had scrubbed spending “ where appropriate . ”
Some program details are available in a classified annex to the legislation , which is kept in a secure place , Room 304 of the House Visitor Center complex .
Any House member is allowed to go to the room and review the annex , but it ’ s not clear how many of them bother to do that . The secrecy extends so far that a spokeswoman for the committee couldn ’ t answer how many members have been over to take a look .
“ My impression is that Congress tends to delegate most of the subject to the committee members , and to follow the committee ’ s lead , ” Mr. Aftergood said . “ The committees , for their part , do seem to take the subject seriously and tend to do their homework , but I would be surprised if a majority of the members of Congress actually read the classified annexes that the White House is objecting to . ”
Mr. Aftergood said the director of national intelligence , the administration ’ s top intelligence coordinator , has been pushing for a reduction in commercial-satellite imagery as a way of cutting costs . But Congress and the industry have fought back .
Taxpayers , however , are largely left out of the fight , having to trust the judgment of the select few members of Congress who invest themselves in the debate — and to trust the lobbyists seeking the government contracts that are doled out .
“ That ’ s one of the defects in the intelligence-budget process — the playing field is skewed in favor of the beneficiaries , ” Mr. Aftergood said . “ There may be programs that I would oppose if I knew about them . ”
Another fight the White House raised in its policy statement involved reporting requirements .
The administration said having to file so many reports with Congress eats up valuable resources , and asked to be released from 30 reports . The intelligence committee repealed just six of the requirements , saying that receiving reports is one way Congress is able to keep tabs on the otherwise murky world of the intelligence community .
A White House spokesman didn ’ t reply to a request for comment Thursday on the administration ’ s objections .
Unlike many other bills , the White House did not issue a veto threat on this legislation . The policy bill doesn ’ t actually spend money , but authorizes the programs that the appropriations committee will fund later .
Underscoring the sensitivity of the matters at hand , the Republican leaders refused to let many amendments even be debated on the chamber floor .
“ If we were to debate some of these amendments , we ’ d be put in the impossible position of supporting or opposing amendments based on facts we simply can ’ t discuss for reasons of national security , ” said Rep. Richard B. Nugent , Florida Republican .
That meant the House never got to debate amendments that would have called for studying whether intelligence data centers could be consolidated to save money , nor did they consider amendments that would have restricted targeted killings or required the government to release the number of Americans who have had their communications monitored by the government in recent years .
The nine amendments that were allowed to come to the floor were all adopted by voice vote , and not a single member spoke out against any of them . They spanned less-thorny issues , such as urging the intelligence community to protect civil liberties or religious and ethnic minorities and allowing information-sharing with Mexico and Canada on drug-trafficking and border security .","Most of the recent battles over government spending have been dramatic, bloody and excruciatingly fought in public, but disputes over the approximately $80 billion budgeted every year for the intelligence community has generally been hidden — until now.

They spanned less-thorny issues, such as urging the intelligence community to protect civil liberties or religious and ethnic minorities and allowing information-sharing with Mexico and Canada on drug-trafficking and border security.

In his Feb. 12 State of the Union address , President Barack Obama said America no longer needs to deploy tens of thousands of troops to occupy nations or meet the evolving threat from new extremist groups . Cyber-attacks are the “ rapidly growing threat , ” he said .
Nevertheless , the defense budget contains hundreds of billions of dollars for new generations of aircraft carriers and stealth fighters , tanks that even the Army says it doesn ’ t need and combat vehicles too heavy to maneuver in desert sands or cross most bridges in Asia , Africa or the Middle East .
“ There ’ s a fundamental need to have a conversation about what kind of military we need to have and what we should expect it to do , ” Andrew Bacevich , a West Point graduate and former Army colonel who now teaches at Boston University , said in an interview .
In the absence of such a conversation , the Pentagon faces the prospect of $ 500 billion in automatic cuts over the next decade , beginning March 1 , with no consensus on what to trim . Instead , the budget is driven largely by champions of existing programs in Congress , the defense industry and the uniformed services . As a result , predicts Bacevich : “ The behemoth of an entity called the Pentagon is not going to shrink . ”
Uncertainty has proven painful for defense contractors , especially smaller companies that don ’ t have deals locked in for months or years to come . Pentagon contracts plunged to $ 12.1 billion in January , a 67 percent decrease from December , according to data compiled by ███ , as the military reined in spending in anticipation of the cuts that may be coming .
The Standard & Poor ’ s Aerospace and Defense Index gained 7.5 percent in the past 12 months , trailing the 13 percent gain for the broader Standard & Poor ’ s 500 Index .
Pentagon spending cuts , should they remain in force over a decade , would mean “ changes in the portfolios of Lockheed , Northrop Grumman , General Dynamics and Boeing , ” the biggest U.S. defense contractors , Byron Callan , a defense analyst in Washington at Capital Alpha Partners LLC , said in an interview . “ Five years from now they ’ ll look different . ”
Information technology units may be spun off and then consolidated , while slow-growing operations such as shipbuilding and armored-vehicle manufacturing may end up in the hands of private equity investors , Callan said .
The U.S. spent $ 689 billion on defense in 2011 , more than 40 percent of all such spending globally in 2011 , according to data compiled by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute . According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office , the Pentagon had $ 1.58 trillion of major weapons projects on its books . Those include the F-35 jet fighter , which is seven years behind schedule and costing 70 percent more than planned ; the Navy ’ s Littoral Combat Ship , plagued by cracks , flaws and a price that ’ s doubled to $ 440 million each ; and M1 tanks the Army doesn ’ t want .
Even if the budget cuts happen , U.S. defense spending is projected to grow about 2.4 percent annually through 2021 , according to the Congressional Budget Office .
The military , the defense industry and their allies in Congress have gone to war over the automatic cuts , called sequestration , with Defense Secretary Leon Panetta , Army General Martin Dempsey , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs , and other leaders saying they would devastate the military .
If their budgets are cut , they argue , ship deployments will be canceled , training will be curtailed , maintenance will be delayed , weapons contracts will be withheld and the military will be unable to respond to contingencies .
“ We ’ ve gone past cutting the meat -- we ’ re into the bone , ” Representative Howard “ Buck ” McKeon , the California Republican who heads the House Armed Services Committee , told a Feb. 6 news conference . He ’ s proposed reducing the number of federal employees and freezing congressional pay to preserve military spending .
Lost in the political melee over defense spending , said Bacevich , is the need for a 21st Century military strategy to keep pace with the changing nature of warfare and guide the drawdown of military forces and spending after more than a decade of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
A year ago , Obama and the Defense Department issued a blueprint for a “ smaller and leaner ” military that would be “ agile , flexible , and ready for the full range of contingencies . ”
Instead , the military ’ s effort to prepare for every possibility has encouraged the Pentagon and defense contractors such as the three largest -- Lockheed Martin Corp. , Chicago-based Boeing Co. , and Northrop Grumman Corp. based in Falls Church , Virginia -- to keep developing ever more complex and costly weapons .
While the increased military spending of the last decade helped the Pentagon advance several battlefield capabilities , the Defense Department still has “ too many programs that are not appropriate and do not provide the next-generation capabilities ” needed , said Barry Blechman , co-founder of the Stimson Center , a Washington policy research institute .
Blechman cited the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter as an example of a weapons program that “ provides some marginal improvement over existing F-16s , but nothing compared with the amount the Pentagon is planning to invest in it. ” The program , which includes variants for the Air Force , Navy and Marine Corps , could be cut or scaled back , Blechman said .
The Pentagon estimates the cost for development and production of 2,443 F-35s at $ 395.7 billion , a 70 percent increase since the initial contract with Bethesda , Maryland-based Lockheed Martin was signed in 2001 . The jet is designed to replace the F-16 fighter , the A-10 “ Warthog ” ground attack plane , F-18C/D Hornet fighter and the Marine Corps ’ AV-8B Harrier jump-jet .
Although the Army ’ s strength is set to decline by 72,000 by 2017 , General Raymond Odierno , the Army Chief of Staff , has said the service must be able to send units large or small to any part of the globe . While the service should reorient itself toward engaging with allies and partners to prevent conflicts , it should be ready to “ win wars on land , ” Odierno wrote Feb. 4 in Foreign Policy magazine .
Nevertheless , the Army ’ s plan to spend as much as $ 32 billion to buy 1,904 new Ground Combat Vehicles , tank-like replacements for its Bradley Fighting Vehicle , “ would be a mistake , ” Blechman said . Instead , the Army needs improved capabilities for small forces that can move quickly to trouble spots , Blechman said . “ I don ’ t know that the slightly improved version of the current ground vehicles is necessary . ”
The new 70-ton vehicle may not be easily transportable by air or sea , and is likely to raise questions about “ how quickly it could be deployed in the event of a conflict , ” according to a January report by the Congressional Research Service .
While even the Army brass have said they don ’ t need an an updated version of the M1 , the combat vehicle that was developed to go track-to-track with the Soviet Union ’ s tanks on the North German Plain , Congress wants to keep paying Falls Church , Virginia-based General Dynamics Corp. to gut and rebuild older tanks .
The Navy is building two versions of the Littoral Combat Ship instead of one as it had planned . Once billed as a low-cost , versatile ship for coastal patrols , the LCS ’ s price has doubled to $ 440 million a ship , and Pentagon testers have found that the ship ’ s guns are ineffective and the vessels may not survive combat .
One attraction of the LCS is that buying it will help the Navy reach its target of 300 ships , making it easier to fulfill the Pentagon ’ s plan to position 60 percent of its ships in the Pacific by 2020 , an increase from the current equal division between the Pacific and Atlantic fleets .
That increased focus on Asia needs to be better spelled out , according to former Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair , a retired Navy admiral who also once headed the U.S. Pacific Command , based in Honolulu .
“ There ’ s no there there beyond a general appreciation of East Asia ’ s importance , ” Blair said of the Obama administration ’ s emphasis on Asia . “ It ’ s not a basis for how we solve a very difficult problem of ensuring we have a hedge against Chinese military aggression without launching ourselves into a spiraling arms race based on mutual suspicion and worst-case analysis . ”
While they warn that further budget cuts would cripple the military , Panetta and Dempsey , as well as former Defense Secretary Robert Gates , have said the Pentagon can cut costs by eliminating jobs and waste .
“ Not every defense dollar is sacrosanct , ” Gates said in September at an event organized by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington . “ One need only spend 10 minutes walking around the Pentagon or any major military headquarters to see excess and redundancy . ”
As defense chief in 2009 , Gates managed to cull 20 weapons systems he considered unnecessary or that had become too expensive . He stopped production of the F-22 fighter , canceled the VH-1 presidential helicopter and reduced the scope of Boeing ’ s Future Combat Systems .
Weapons aren ’ t the only part of the Pentagon budget that has proven difficult to rein in . Rising operations and maintenance costs as well as “ significant increases ” in the military ’ s health-care system , which has been politically sacrosanct in the past , will be the primary causes of defense budget growth through 2030 , the Congressional Budget Office said in a July report .
Promised savings mostly have eluded presidents and defense secretaries going back to the 1980s , said retired Marine Corps Major General Arnold Punaro , who ’ s been advising former Nebraska Republican senator Chuck Hagel , Obama ’ s nominee to succeed the retiring Panetta .
While military officials protest cuts to their forces , operations , maintenance and training , they ’ ve allowed their own staffs to grow , said Punaro , who ’ s now a consultant and last year headed a Defense Business Board panel to identify such excess .
The size of the Joint Chiefs of Staff office has more than tripled to 4,244 in 2012 from 1,313 in 2010 , according to the Pentagon ’ s annual manpower report .
“ The Pentagon ’ s leadership should set an example ” by reducing their staffs , Punaro said in an interview . “ If senior people in the Pentagon can ’ t cut the size of the staff and the size of office of the secretary of defense , then how can they expect the rest of the department to tighten its belt ? ”
The increase stemmed mostly from the joint staff absorbing many employees of the Joint Forces Command in Norfolk , Virginia , which was shuttered by Gates in 2011 , Dempsey said in an e-mail . The additions were necessary because the joint staff “ assumed responsibility for core missions ” previously done by the Joint Forces Command , which was created in 1999 to lead the post-Cold War transformation of the U.S. military , Dempsey said .
Still , while the Pentagon is cutting combat forces , “ We are not cutting the overhead proportionately , ” Punaro said . “ People have been trying to get at this issue in the Pentagon for 50 years . And frankly we haven ’ t really put a dent in the overhead costs . It ’ s not for the lack of trying . ”","SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email

The White House had hoped he would hold off until this week
CNN has learned the White House wanted Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to wait until this week to resign , so it would have a new nominee in place by then . But Hagel refused to wait , deciding if the White House was going to push him out , he wanted to make his resignation known as quickly as possible .
Hagel resigned a full week earlier on Nov. 24 . A source very close to Hagel and the resignation process detailed that decision to CNN .
`` Once the secretary saw that he would have to go , he wanted to move quickly , '' the source said . After months of frustration with the White House , Hagel wanted to `` at least control his departure . ''
A second source highly familiar with the resignation of Hagel , and the search for a new nominee , tells CNN that in the days before he resigned , Hagel consulted both Republican and Democratic former senators about whether there was a way for him to stay on the job , and concluded there was not .
GOP Sen. John McCain told News Talk 550 radio in Arizona on the day Hagel resigned that the defense secretary had recently visited him and expressed his displeasure with the White House .
`` I know Chuck was frustrated with aspects of the administration 's national security policy and decision making process , '' McCain had said . `` His predecessors have spoken about the excessive micro-management they faced from the White House and how that made it more difficult to do their jobs successfully .
Behind the scenes one close Hagel advisor is former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell . It is not clear how closely the two men talked about this issue . Officials have characterized the decision to replace Hagel as mutual between the President and the secretary . A senior US official not in the Pentagon says the White House had become increasingly disenchanted with Hagel , feeling he was not clearly articulating White House strategy and Hagel had become frustrated .
Hagel 's determination to resign on his own timing , began a series of events that has left the White House scrambling to find a nominee . Often , a replacement is announced at the same time a resignation is made public .

The White House had hoped he would hold off until this week

Hagel's frustrations with micromanagement led to his early departure

CNN has learned the White House wanted Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to wait until this week to resign, so it would have a new nominee in place by then. But Hagel refused to wait, deciding if the White House was going to push him out, he wanted to make his resignation known as quickly as possible.

Hagel resigned a full week earlier on Nov. 24. A source very close to Hagel and the resignation process detailed that decision to CNN.

""Once the secretary saw that he would have to go, he wanted to move quickly,"" the source said. After months of frustration with the White House, Hagel wanted to ""at least control his departure.""

A second source highly familiar with the resignation of Hagel, and the search for a new nominee, tells CNN that in the days before he resigned, Hagel consulted both Republican and Democratic former senators about whether there was a way for him to stay on the job, and concluded there was not.

GOP Sen. John McCain told News Talk 550 radio in Arizona on the day Hagel resigned that the defense secretary had recently visited him and expressed his displeasure with the White House.

""I know Chuck was frustrated with aspects of the administration's national security policy and decision making process,"" McCain had said. ""His predecessors have spoken about the excessive micro-management they faced from the White House and how that made it more difficult to do their jobs successfully.

McCain added: ""Chuck's situation was no different.""

Behind the scenes one close Hagel advisor is former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell. It is not clear how closely the two men talked about this issue. Officials have characterized the decision to replace Hagel as mutual between the President and the secretary. A senior US official not in the Pentagon says the White House had become increasingly disenchanted with Hagel, feeling he was not clearly articulating White House strategy and Hagel had become frustrated.

Hagel's determination to resign on his own timing, began a series of events that has left the White House scrambling to find a nominee. Often, a replacement is announced at the same time a resignation is made public. Both sources tell CNN that the supposed front runner, Michele Flournoy, was not a fully vetted and selected candidate by the time Hagel resigned, and that she pulled her name after talks with the White House. Several people familiar with Flournoy's thinking say she decided to withdraw her name in part out of concern over dealing with White House micromanagement.

Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, the second source says, was essentially put on the White House's so called short list after Flournoy withdrew to make it look like there were high-level candidates under consideration. But several sources tell CNN that Johnson quickly made it clear he didn't want to go through another confirmation hearing and was reluctant to leave DHS after less than a year on the job.

Only two people know how the affair started, but the world knows now about its inglorious end.

Admitting to the extramarital affair, David Petraeus stepped down as director of the CIA on Friday in a surprise move that shocked the intelligence community just days after President Barack Obama was re-elected.

Immediate praise for the man poured in. The president hailed Petraeus' dedication and patriotism, while leaders from both parties said he would be missed.

It appeared an abrupt end to a spectacularly successful career in public service.

""After being married for over 37 years, I showed extremely poor judgment by engaging in an extramarital affair. Such behavior is unacceptable, both as a husband and as the leader of an organization such as ours,"" Petraeus said in a letter to colleagues, explaining his decision to step down.

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., is fighting for her bill to curb sexual assaults in the military. Her measure would give independent military prosecutors, rather than commanders, the power to decide which cases should be tried in military court.

Military leaders fiercely oppose moving that authority outside the chain of command, arguing that commanders are responsible for the health and welfare of their soldiers. Removing their authority would undermine their ability to lead, they say.

Gillibrand says commanders are not experts on serious assaults and are unable to prevent retaliation against victims who report crimes.

""Frankly, they've failed up until now to keep the command climate free of assault, rape and retaliation,"" she says.

Gillibrand's bill, which includes murder along with rape and sexual assault, was rejected by the Senate Armed Services Committee, but has gained bipartisan backing from senators outside the committee, including Republicans Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas. She intends to bring the bill to the Senate floor, where members outside the committee have fewer ties to military.

""We created this framework because, frankly, that's what our allies have done in the past,"" Gillibrand told weekends on All Things Considered host Jacki Lyden.

""The UK, Israel, Australia, Canada, Germany, all have removed serious crimes outside of the chain of command to create an objective military justice system that doesn't have command influence affecting the outcome.""

Interview Highlights

On commanders' responsibilities

""Only the commanders are responsible for ensuring good order and discipline and they have to set a command climate where, first of all, these rapes and assaults aren't taking place. But if they do take place, [commanders can make sure] that there is room for reporting, that people feel comfortable, that justice can be done and to assure that there is no retaliation.

""What we are finding, though, is that commanders in charge today are not assuring that for victims. Sixty-two percent of victims who have reported their crimes report that they were retaliated against for reporting.""

How to define assault

""For the most part, these are violent crimes. There's no confusion. Of the 3,300 cases that were actually reported, 70 percent were violent assaults and violent rapes, criminal conduct that is based on power and domination. These are not dates that have gone badly, these are not questions of whether she said yes, then no, then yes, then no. This is not an issue of hormones, as some of my colleagues have mentioned. These are violent crimes perpetrated by, often, predators who are recidivists, and these are crimes of domination and violence.""

What's at stake in this uphill battle?

""At the end of the day, commanders aren't objective. Commanders may have different training, different perspectives. They may or may not want women in the armed forces. They may not understand what sexual assault is, or what constitutes rape. They may not agree, what is a rape or not a rape. But that shouldn't be their judgment. It should be an objective, trained prosecutor who makes the decision about whether or not there is evidence to prosecute these crimes. That hopefully will instill more confidence in the system, that justice can be possible.""",www.npr.org,center,wsDBtxMO9Hgf6LdO

Chuck Hagel as the next Secretary of Defense . Democrats ' cloture motion to proceed to an up-or-down vote failed 58-40 , with one Senator voting `` present . '' Achieving cloture requires 60 votes . Let 's be candid : Hagel ( a Republican ) is unqualified for this job , which is arguably the most important position in a presidential cabinet . He all but admitted as much during his disastrous Senate hearings last month :
During prickly exchanges with his former Senate colleagues , Hagel downplayed and `` clarified '' previous denunciations of the , er , `` Jewish lobby , '' which he once accused of regularly `` intimidating '' members of Congress . He also butchered the administration 's position on a nuclear Iran , twice getting his facts wrong . Eventually a sympathetic Democrat was forced to step in and rescue the floundering witness :
Matters did n't improve when Mr. Hagel announced , regarding Iran 's nuclear capacity , that he supported the president 's strong position on `` containment . '' But the administration 's policy is not , as Mr. Hagel apparently had yet to learn , containment—it is to prevent Iran 's development of nuclear arms . Nudged by a note handed him by an aide , the nominee corrected himself and declared that in fact the U.S. does n't have a policy on containment . This was one misstatement too many for Carl Levin—the committee chairman , a Democrat and supporter of Mr. Hagel 's nomination—who ended the discussion with his own terse correction : `` We do have a position on containment , and that is we do not favor containment . ''
Even many Democrats and media commentators did n't bother sugarcoating Hagel 's dreadful performance . Republicans have continued to hammer away at Hagel for his record on Israel , Iran , and terrorism -- including votes against tougher sanctions on the Iranian regime and a refusal to classify Iran 's revolutionary guard as a terrorist organization . Hagel was also the only US Senator who declined to sign a statement decrying anti-Semitism in Russia , though he says his refusal to sign had nothing to do with the content of the letter . Just today , another blast from Hagel 's rhetorical past came to light :
Fox News Channel on Tuesday reported that secretary of defense nominee Chuck Hagel failed to disclose to the United States Senate speeches delivered to controversial groups such as the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee as well as James Zogby ’ s Arab American Institute . Meanwhile , a 2007 speech then-Sen. Hagel delivered at Rutgers University in New Jersey as he tested the waters for a presidential run is drawing fresh scrutiny . Hagel said the U.S. Department of State was an adjunct of the Israeli foreign minister ’ s office , according to a contemporaneous report of the event .
President Obama 's nominee for Secretary of Defense is testy about the influence of the `` Jewish lobby '' and basically said that the State Department is run by Israel . The government of Iran has effectively endorsed his nomination . Opponents of the nomination are demanding more financial disclosures from Hagel , particularly regarding foreign income ; the White House is fighting these calls for increased transparency , as are many Congressional Democrats who once demanded similar information from Bush appointees .

Rubin replies : `` We can ’ t 'dictate ' to Iran ? We are of course attempting to enforce multiple United Nations sanctions and resolutions of which Iran is in violation . Does he take the side of Iran , that it has a 'right ' to pursue its nuclear weapons program ? ''","Senate Republicans have at least temporarily blocked the confirmation of former Sen. Chuck Hagel as the next Secretary of Defense. Democrats' cloture motion to proceed to an up-or-down vote failed 58-40, with one Senator voting ""present."" Achieving cloture requires 60 votes. Let's be candid: Hagel (a Republican) is unqualified for this job, which is arguably the most important position in a presidential cabinet. He all but admitted as much during his disastrous Senate hearings last month:





During prickly exchanges with his former Senate colleagues, Hagel downplayed and ""clarified"" previous denunciations of the, er, ""Jewish lobby,"" which he once accused of regularly ""intimidating"" members of Congress. He also butchered the administration's position on a nuclear Iran, twice getting his facts wrong. Eventually a sympathetic Democrat was forced to step in and rescue the floundering witness:



Matters didn't improve when Mr. Hagel announced, regarding Iran's nuclear capacity, that he supported the president's strong position on ""containment."" But the administration's policy is not, as Mr. Hagel apparently had yet to learn, containment—it is to prevent Iran's development of nuclear arms. Nudged by a note handed him by an aide, the nominee corrected himself and declared that in fact the U.S. doesn't have a policy on containment. This was one misstatement too many for Carl Levin—the committee chairman, a Democrat and supporter of Mr. Hagel's nomination—who ended the discussion with his own terse correction: ""We do have a position on containment, and that is we do not favor containment.""



Even many Democrats and media commentators didn't bother sugarcoating Hagel's dreadful performance. Republicans have continued to hammer away at Hagel for his record on Israel, Iran, and terrorism -- including votes against tougher sanctions on the Iranian regime and a refusal to classify Iran's revolutionary guard as a terrorist organization. Hagel was also the only US Senator who declined to sign a statement decrying anti-Semitism in Russia, though he says his refusal to sign had nothing to do with the content of the letter. Just today, another blast from Hagel's rhetorical past came to light:



Fox News Channel on Tuesday reported that secretary of defense nominee Chuck Hagel failed to disclose to the United States Senate speeches delivered to controversial groups such as the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee as well as James Zogby’s Arab American Institute. Meanwhile, a 2007 speech then-Sen. Hagel delivered at Rutgers University in New Jersey as he tested the waters for a presidential run is drawing fresh scrutiny. Hagel said the U.S. Department of State was an adjunct of the Israeli foreign minister’s office, according to a contemporaneous report of the event.



President Obama's nominee for Secretary of Defense is testy about the influence of the ""Jewish lobby"" and basically said that the State Department is run by Israel. The government of Iran has effectively endorsed his nomination. Opponents of the nomination are demanding more financial disclosures from Hagel, particularly regarding foreign income; the White House is fighting these calls for increased transparency, as are many Congressional Democrats who once demanded similar information from Bush appointees. In short, Hagel is an incompetent who was utterly unprepared for his confirmation hearings, has demonstrated an enduring hostility towards Israel and possibly Jews generally, and has a voting record that's worrisomely soft on outlaw regimes that threaten our security. And yet he enjoys universal support among Senate Democrats, whose only apparent standard for a evaluating a nominee for a critical position is whether or not the man who picked him is named 'Barack Obama.' It's widely believed, incidentally, that the president is high on Hagel because he'll provide some helpful bipartisan gloss when Obama makes deep military cuts.

That ’ s a golden opportunity to finally ask some tough questions about his prior service on the board of Theranos , a company that allegedly peddled fake blood tests and peddled connections to influential people in the national security world to get away with it for years .
Theranos was one of the largest business scandals of the past decades , described by the Securities and Exchange Commission as an “ elaborate , years-long fraud ” in which CEO Elizabeth Holmes and President Ramesh “ Sunny ” Balwani , “ exaggerated or made false statements about the company ’ s technology , business , and financial performance . ”
Mattis not only served on Theranos ’ s board during some of the years after he ’ d retired from military service , while it was perpetrating the scheme , but he earlier served as a key advocate of putting the company ’ s technology ( technology that was , to be clear , fake ) to use inside the military while he was still serving as a general . Holmes settled the SEC case , paying a $ 500,000 fee and accepting various other penalties , while Balwani is fighting it out in court . ( Holmes and Balwani are both battling criminal fraud charges . )
Nobody on the board has been directly charged with anything . But accepting six-figure checks to serve as a frontman for a con operation is the kind of thing that would normally count as a liability in American politics .
While the Theranos scandal was on the front burner of American politics , nobody wanted to talk about Mattis ’ s involvement . Trump and his co-partisans in Congress didn ’ t want to talk about it . But the Democratic Party opposition was also inclined to give Mattis a pass . Everyone in Washington was more or less convinced that Mattis ’ s presence in the Pentagon was the only thing standing between us and possible nuclear Armageddon .
But Mattis isn ’ t “ the adult in the room ” anymore , the supposed savior of the country . He ’ s just a guy trading on his reputation to try to sell books . And his prior use of his position to profit from a massive scheme deserves scrutiny .
Theranos was the kind of story that a lot of people wanted to believe in . A technology startup led by a bright , young Stanford dropout that , unlike so many essentially frivolous apps , was actually going to solve the urgent problem of making health care cheaper and easier to access . The problem , as revealed by the Wall Street Journal ’ s John Carreyrou in an October 2015 exposé , was that the whole thing was a sham .
Theranos ’ s key technology , called Edison machines , didn ’ t really work , and Theranos wasn ’ t actually using them to perform its blood tests , relying instead on older Samsung equipment . Theranos offered lower prices than the competition not because it had an innovative new product , but because it was a money-losing startup burning cash raised from venture capitalists .
This scheme worked because Theranos was deeply tied in with the American political , business , and media establishment — counting former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and George Shultz as board members , and maintaining sufficient clout that Hillary Clinton ’ s campaign was unwise enough to schedule a high-profile fundraiser with Holmes months after the publication of Carreyrou ’ s exposé .
But perhaps none of these elite supporters was as valuable as Mattis .
As the SEC complaint describes , a main element of the scheme was that “ Holmes , and Balwani claimed that Theranos ’ products were deployed by the U.S. Department of Defense on the battlefield in Afghanistan and on medevac helicopters and that the company would generate more than $ 100 million in revenue in 2014 . ”
Holmes , the SEC alleged , “ knew , or was reckless in not knowing , that these statements were false and misleading. ” It ’ s easy to see , however , why investors might be fooled about this because one of the company ’ s board members , Mattis , joined Theranos in 2013 immediately after retiring from a long career of military service that concluded with a stint leading CENTCOM , the US combatant command that is responsible for , among other things , Afghanistan .
Mattis ( who , obviously , has no expertise in medical testing ) pushed for the military to use Theranos technology , but it was never used because it didn ’ t work .
Nonetheless , as of December 2015 , Mattis was still vouching for the company , telling the Washington Post that he “ had quickly seen tremendous potential in the technologies Theranos develops , and I have the greatest respect for the company ’ s mission and integrity . ”
The technology , it is now clear , had no potential , and the company had no integrity .
By the time Mattis was selected to serve as Trump ’ s secretary of defense in January 2017 , the scope of the Theranos scandal was already well-known to the public thanks to diligent journalistic work . So was the fact that Mattis was not only earning $ 150,000 a year for his service on the Theranos board but also advocated for the company while on active military duty .
He resigned from Theranos on January 5 , 2017 — by which time the company was already commonly described as “ embroiled in scandal ” by press reports — but , remarkably , the whole affair didn ’ t come up at his confirmation hearings .
It ’ s not exactly rare for members of a corporate board of directors to serve as window dressing with no actual involvement in or knowledge of a company ’ s operations , so the mere fact that the whole company seems to have been a giant scam doesn ’ t necessarily reflect any action on Mattis ’ s part . That said , at least in theory , directors are supposed to do something , and serving as window dressing for alleged fraud is the kind of thing that normally reflects poorly on a person ’ s reputation .
What ’ s more , as Paul Szoldra writes at Task and Purpose , pre-retirement Mattis genuinely seems to have been actively involved in trying to help Theranos bypass the regulatory process :
“ I would very much appreciate your help in getting this information corrected with the regulatory agencies , ” Holmes wrote in an email to Mattis , also obtained by the Post . “ Since this misinformation came from within DoD , it will be invaluable if this information is formally corrected by the right people in DoD. ” The general then forwarded the email chain on and asked , “ how do we overcome this new obstacle ? ” “ I have tried to get this device tested in theater asap , legally and ethically , ” Mattis wrote . “ This appears to be relatively straight-forward yet we ’ re a year into this and not yet deployed . ”
Yet even once the SEC threw the book at the company , nobody in Congress was interested in asking Mattis what , exactly , he knew about Theranos and when . And in a perverse way , that made sense .

James Mattis profited from helping Theranos

Theranos was the kind of story that a lot of people wanted to believe in. A technology startup led by a bright, young Stanford dropout that, unlike so many essentially frivolous apps, was actually going to solve the urgent problem of making health care cheaper and easier to access. The problem, as revealed by the Wall Street Journal’s John Carreyrou in an October 2015 exposé, was that the whole thing was a sham.

This scheme worked because Theranos was deeply tied in with the American political, business, and media establishment — counting former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and George Shultz as board members, and maintaining sufficient clout that Hillary Clinton’s campaign was unwise enough to schedule a high-profile fundraiser with Holmes months after the publication of Carreyrou’s exposé.

But perhaps none of these elite supporters was as valuable as Mattis.

As the SEC complaint describes, a main element of the scheme was that “Holmes, and Balwani claimed that Theranos’ products were deployed by the U.S. Department of Defense on the battlefield in Afghanistan and on medevac helicopters and that the company would generate more than $100 million in revenue in 2014.”

The technology, it is now clear, had no potential, and the company had no integrity.

Nobody has properly questioned Mattis about this

By the time Mattis was selected to serve as Trump’s secretary of defense in January 2017, the scope of the Theranos scandal was already well-known to the public thanks to diligent journalistic work. So was the fact that Mattis was not only earning $150,000 a year for his service on the Theranos board but also advocated for the company while on active military duty.

WASHINGTON — The Pentagon announced late Friday that it will delay until at least 2018 rolling out its policy for acceptance of transgender troops into the ranks.

The move by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis comes just hours before a July 1 deadline, set in the Obama administration, for the military to recruit transgender enlisted troops and to accept new officers.

""Secretary Mattis today approved a recommendation by the services to defer accessing transgender applicants into the military until Jan. 1, 2018,"" Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said in a statement. ""The services will review their accession plans and provide input on the impact to the readiness and lethality of our forces.""

In May, Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work had ordered the armed services to advise him of their plans to meet the deadline, or advise him of concerns about how accepting new transgender troops could affect the military's readiness to fight. The Army and Marine Corps both sought delays.

Transgender troops already in the ranks can continue to serve, under the policy developed last year by then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter. Mattis has made clear that the military's readiness to fight is his top priority.

Army orders soldiers to undergo training to accept transgender troops

But the lack of a policy to accept new transgender troops already has caused problems. In May, the Air Force and Army were unable to commission transgender cadets from their prestigious military academies because the military lacks an acceptance policy for new transgender troops.

Aaron Belkin, director of the Palm Center, which studies issues of sexuality in the military, said it would force troops to lie about their identity, as did the former policy that prohibited gay and lesbian troops from serving openly.

“Secretary Mattis' decision to prolong the enlistment ban will have the effect of requiring applicants to lie in order to join the military, as was the case under ‘Don’t Ask, don’t tell,’ Belkin said. “That makes no sense because, as predicted by all of the research, transgender military service has been a success. “

Moon , who has been in office just 10 months , played a pivotal role in setting up the potential summit . That ’ s a particularly impressive accomplishment for Moon given that he and Trump have at times clashed sharply about how aggressively to confront North Korea . Tensions got so bad that in September , Trump accused Moon of “ appeasement . ”
Trump is taking a very different line now , expressing an openness to talks with Kim that would have seemed unimaginable when the president threatened to “ totally destroy ” North Korea during a United Nations address in September .
Experts say the shift reflects the success of Moon ’ s persistent push for “ anytime , anywhere ” diplomacy with Pyongyang . The South Korean leader ’ s efforts got a major boost during the runup to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics , when he and Kim got into high-level talks over North Korea ’ s participation in the games . Moon used the momentum from those talks to set the stage for an unprecedented US-North Korean summit .
“ South Korea deserves the vast bulk of the credit for this summit offer , ” Mintaro Oba , a former State Department official who worked on North Korea policy , told me . “ This wouldn ’ t have happened without President Moon ’ s initiative and deftness in balancing engagement with North Korea and close coordination with the United States . ”

Moon, who has been in office just 10 months, played a pivotal role in setting up the potential summit. That’s a particularly impressive accomplishment for Moon given that he and Trump have at times clashed sharply about how aggressively to confront North Korea. Tensions got so bad that in September, Trump accused Moon of “appeasement.”

Trump is taking a very different line now, expressing an openness to talks with Kim that would have seemed unimaginable when the president threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea during a United Nations address in September.

Experts say the shift reflects the success of Moon’s persistent push for “anytime, anywhere” diplomacy with Pyongyang. The South Korean leader’s efforts got a major boost during the runup to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, when he and Kim got into high-level talks over North Korea’s participation in the games. Moon used the momentum from those talks to set the stage for an unprecedented US-North Korean summit.

“South Korea deserves the vast bulk of the credit for this summit offer,” Mintaro Oba, a former State Department official who worked on North Korea policy, told me. “This wouldn’t have happened without President Moon’s initiative and deftness in balancing engagement with North Korea and close coordination with the United States.”

Moon’s orchestration of this meeting has, at least for now, significantly diminished the chance of violent conflict breaking out between North Korea and the US and steered the relationship toward the kind of open-minded diplomacy that he has called for for decades.

He’s also managed to break the pattern of what some South Koreans call “Korea passing” — the way the big regional players like China, Japan, and the US at times exclude or sideline South Korea in talks about North Korea policy. Moon has managed to charm Trump after a period of stormy relations, and has ensured that South Korea is now playing an indispensable role in talks over denuclearizing North Korea.

But it’s also a risky gambit. Moon can bring the US and North Korea to the table, but he can’t force them into a deal. And if the negotiations fail, Kim and Trump might, in a worst-case scenario, decide that military force is the only option left.

Moon’s plan could backfire

Thursday brought the latest twist in the saga of Chuck Hagel's nomination to be President Obama's second-term defense secretary.

Hagel's nomination came two Senate votes short of the required 60 that would have allowed it to proceed to a final vote. The vote, largely along party lines, was 58 to 40 with one senator voting present.

Four Republicans voted with Democrats to end debate and proceed to a final vote. They were Mike Johanns of Nebraska, Thad Cochran of Mississippi, Susan Collins of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.

""Just when you thought things couldn't get worse, it gets worse"" said Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., the majority leader. Reid said he planned to schedule another procedural vote for the week after next to try to advance Hagel's nomination to a final vote.

Reid and other Democrats insisted that the Republicans had filibustered the Hagel nomination, the first time a defense secretary has had his nominations stalled in such a way.

Republicans insisted they hadn't filibustered the nomination. ""This is not an attempt to kill this nomination,"" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, the Senate minority whip. ""It's not a filibuster."" Cornyn said some Republicans were merely seeking more time to have additional questions answered.

Although Hagel had drawn immediate early opposition, it had looked for many weeks that while many Republicans would vote against Hagel's confirmation, no one would actively try to block it.

Among the Republican senators reportedly open to at least allowing Hagel's nomination to receive an up-or-down final vote — so long as it comes after the recess — are Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. In a final post-filibuster floor vote, Hagel would need only 51 votes to be confirmed.

Senate Republicans have argued that before a floor vote on his nomination happens, Hagel needs to answer more questions about speeches he has given since leaving the Senate in 2009, including to an Arab-American group. They've also raised questions about his financial dealings, queries which Senate Democrats say are unjustified.

Meanwhile, Senate Republicans have expanded the questions they want answered before they allow a vote on Hagel. Some questions for the administration center on an issue unrelated to Hagel: the Sept. 11, 2012, Benghazi attack on the U.S. Consulate and its aftermath. The attack led to the deaths of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.

For President Obama's choice to become defense secretary, first came the flaying, then the filibustering.

It wasn't that much of a surprise that Senate Republicans on Wednesday refused to end debate on Chuck Hagel's nomination, forcing Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., to try to find 60 votes to move the nomination forward to a final vote.

Some Senate Republicans, after all, have been telegraphing that a filibuster was a very real possibility. That was after they pummeled Hagel, a Nebraskan who once counted himself among their number, during a grueling confirmation hearing.

They were displeased with Hagel for any number of reasons: He had gone from supporting to opposing the Iraq War and surge during the George W. Bush administration. He was too soft on Iran and too hard on Israel, they said. And Hagel didn't help himself at the hearing when he often came across as unfocused.

Hagel's nomination made it out of the Senate Armed Services Committee Tuesday on a straight party line vote, another ominous sign.

Then on Wednesday afternoon, Reid announced he was filing a cloture motion, Senate-speak for an attempt to end a filibuster. He couldn't reach agreement with Sen. James Inhofe, the Oklahoman who is the top Republican on the Armed Services panel, to end debate.

Among Inhofe's stated concerns about Hagel, he has said, is that the Iranian Foreign Ministry supports his nomination. Sen. Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who is the committee's chairman, has suggested that perhaps the Iranians are being bomb throwers and trying to cause mischief in American policy circles.

In any event, Reid has scheduled the vote to end the debate for Friday unless an agreement is reached beforehand.

""This is the first time in the history of our country that a presidential nominee for secretary of defense has been filibustered,"" Reid said Wednesday on the Senate floor. ""What a shame. But that's the way it is.""

defense,Politico,0,http://www.politico.com/story/2013/11/military-sex-assault-obama-99962.html,Brass shirk Obama's marching orders on sex assault,2013-11-17,Darren Samuelsohn,"Martin Dempsey and Chuck Hagel have publicly been vocal on the issue . Brass slow-walk sex-assault orders
President Barack Obama set a high bar for the Pentagon ’ s civilian and military leaders in May when he delivered marching orders on sexual assault .
“ We will not stop until we ’ ve seen this scourge , from what is the greatest military in the world , eliminated , ” Obama said in a late afternoon Cabinet room meeting , flanked by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Martin Dempsey .
Like good soldiers , Hagel and Dempsey have been busy since , writing new rules on troop harassment , checking in on progress every week and pretty much prodding everyone , civilian and enlisted , to pick up their game .
But privately , military officials also are trying to be realistic about what they can do — and the rhetoric they ’ re using and the policy prescriptions they ’ re advocating fall well below the goals set for them by their commander in chief .
“ I ’ d say this conversation , this response , is better framed in how far can we go to mitigate this issue because eradicating it is not even in the realm of possible , ” a senior Pentagon official acknowledged to ███ this summer .
The seeming disconnect between Obama and his top Pentagon advisers is not only not surprising , it follows a historical trend . Military leaders frequently differ from their civilian bosses on the big social issues of the time .
Harry Truman ’ s battles with the generals culminated in an executive order integrating African-Americans into the military . Bill Clinton ’ s 1992 campaign promise allowing gays in the military turned into the “ don ’ t ask , don ’ t tell ” compromise when military brass , led by Gen. Colin Powell , balked . Obama allowed women into combat roles , ending decades of incremental change and bureaucratic foot-dragging .
With sexual assault , once again there is daylight between a president and the Pentagon ’ s top commanders — and , again , over how to solve a problem that the armed forces has faced for decades .
Dempsey and the military brass are urging the Senate to use caution before making some of the changes they are considering making on sexual assault as soon as this week as part of the annual defense authorization bill . Their opposition centers around a far-reaching plan from Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ( D-N.Y. ) that would remove the chain of command from prosecuting sexual assaults and other major crimes .
As the Defense Department ’ s first enlisted combat veteran to serve as secretary , Hagel also has advocated against rocking the boat . He ’ s said repeatedly that he ’ s open to any good ideas from Congress . But he ’ s also personally lobbied senators to vote against Gillibrand ’ s amendment , testifying this spring that he didn ’ t think it would be smart to eliminate the military ’ s command structure from the military ’ s justice system .
“ Because it is the culture . It is the institution . It ’ s the people within that institution that have to fix the problem , and that ’ s the culture . The people are the culture . So I don ’ t know how you disconnect that from the accountability of command , ” Hagel told the Senate Budget Committee in June .
Obama , meantime , has left plenty to the imagination , in much the same way Clinton did 20 years ago on gays in the military . The president told Hagel and Dempsey earlier this year to “ leave no stone unturned ” when looking at the legislative options . He ’ s got some of his top advisers on the issue , including Vice President Joe Biden , Valerie Jarrett and Michelle Obama ’ s chief of staff .
But Obama also has taken no public position on the Gillibrand amendment . That ’ s allowed him to avoid angering the generals he needs to carry out their military orders , but it ’ s left frustrated some of the women ’ s groups that twice helped elect him .
“ I think he ’ s probably in an uncomfortable situation , ” said retired Brig . Gen. Dennis McGinnis , a former Obama Defense Department appointee who supports Gillibrand ’ s proposal . “ He ’ s looking for guidance from the brass and the brass is trying to let the system work itself out . ”
The brass no doubt are trying to clean up the ranks from within . Hagel meets weekly for an hour with the Pentagon ’ s sexual assault team to hear what each of the branches is doing to tackle the problem . Dempsey , who acknowledged taking his “ eye off the ball ” during a decade of wars , is working the topic too .
“ He ’ s got Syria , Iran , Afghanistan and the rest of the world to worry about , and he and I talk about this issue all the time . That ’ s a fundamental change compared to last year , ” Army Brig . Gen. Richard Gross , Dempsey ’ s top legal counsel , said this fall during testimony before a congressionally chartered panel studying the issue .
But the Pentagon ’ s interests also are different from those of Obama and the civilians he has put in charge . Richard Socarides , a former Clinton White House aide who worked on “ don ’ t ask , don ’ t tell , ” said that ’ s reason enough for the president to look elsewhere for advice .
“ The military always thinks it knows what ’ s best when it comes to their own and at most will humor the civilian leadership by listening to their views , but thereafter pretty much they do whatever they want , ” he said .
Military officials note they come at the issue from a different perspective , knowing that bad actors are serving inside a population that ’ s mostly young , mostly male and far away from family , friends and familiar surroundings . Inside the ranks is a macho , alcohol-filled environment where sexual assaults do happen .
The military is also a conservative institution at its core , where its way of handling a problem doesn ’ t even come close to the common response of political leaders more familiar with polls and election strategies .
It ’ s a split that “ gets to the heart of how units are organized , constituted and disciplined , ” said Michael O ’ Hanlon , a senior fellow and defense expert at the Brookings Institution .
“ Saying an officer can ’ t handle sexual assault within his or her unit is akin to saying that the officer can ’ t handle his unit … and challenges the core notion that a commander must be responsible for all that his or her subordinates do in combat and more broadly , ” O ’ Hanlon said .
Looking at the responses from Obama , Hagel and the Pentagon generals on the issue , O ’ Hanlon said he sees a “ bit of a divide on the understanding of the severity of the problem . ”
“ Uniformed military personnel don ’ t tolerate sexual assault as a rule , but they also know the vast majority of personnel don ’ t commit such acts , ” he said . “ They intuitively sense what the statistics show , that this may not be more of a problem in the military than elsewhere in society . By contrast , civilians are reacting to learning about a new problem they didn ’ t understand before . So their instinct is to try to do something about it . ”
For the military leaders aggressively fighting Gillibrand , the changes would be dramatic if the Senate adopted her proposal and Obama ultimately signed it into law .
A slate of military lawyers would have final say instead of commanders about who faces court-martial . That matters to the career brass who would be “ losing power personally ” long after the current administration leaves office , said Rachel VanLandingham , a former lawyer for the Air Force Judge Advocate General ’ s Corps who worked as a chief legal adviser to U.S. Central Command under Dempsey and Gen. David Petraeus .
“ They are commanders , who will individually and collectively have their prosecutorial power taken away in a wide swath of cases if Sen. Gillibrand ’ s legislation wins the day . And they and their subordinate commanders have to continue to lead troops and maintain good order and discipline the day after such change , ” she said .
“ Secretary Hagel isn ’ t losing anything , except perhaps the support of his Joint Chiefs , and isn ’ t leading troops — isn ’ t directly responsible for their lives in the way commanders such as Gen. Dempsey has been — today or tomorrow , ” VanLandingham added .
Retired Maj. Gen. John Altenburg Jr. , a former Army deputy Judge Advocate General , agreed that it ’ s the complicated implementation of the Gillibrand proposal that helps explain the difference in reaction between the White House and Pentagon military leaders .
“ There ’ s always some daylight there , ” he said . “ For me , it ’ s explained by the fact that these are the people who have to go do it . They understand better than anybody else the implications of change and how many resources it requires to make a change . ”
Denise Krepp , a retired Coast Guard officer and former Obama chief counsel at the U.S. Maritime Administration , said she ’ d like to see the president “ take a strong stand ” on Gillibrand ’ s amendment , though she ’ s also not surprised he ’ s stayed out of it so far in deference to the brass .
“ They ’ re going to give him a very strong argument that any deviation would create chaos , ” she said .
While Obama has avoided angering the military and parts of his political base , his continued silence has also left room for others around him to steal the spotlight .
Two of his female nominees to top military posts have already gotten stuck in the Senate because of their work on the sexual assault issue .
Lt. Gen. Susan Helms , tapped to be the No . 2 leader at the Air Force Space Command , recently opted for retirement rather than wait any longer for Sen. Claire McCaskill ( D-Mo . ) to lift a hold she placed on the nomination last spring . Helms got in McCaskill ’ s cross hairs for overturning a jury conviction in 2012 on a sexual assault case .
Gillibrand has also blocked Jo Ann Rooney to be undersecretary of the Navy because of written testimony she delivered to a Senate committee , indicating she ’ d weigh a unit ’ s morale among the reasons for deciding whether to prosecute a sexual assault case — not just the evidence .
Then there ’ s Jeh Johnson , Obama ’ s first-term Pentagon general counsel , now awaiting Senate confirmation to become the next Homeland Security secretary . Earlier this year , after leaving his Defense Department job but before his latest nomination , Johnson questioned the integrity of the Pentagon ’ s current prosecution system in an appearance on MSNBC .
“ The problem , I believe , has become so pervasive , the bad behavior is so pervasive , we need to look at fundamental change in the military justice system itself , ” Johnson told Rachel Maddow .
For the senators who have heard plenty from the Pentagon concerning its opposition to the amendment , they say now is the time for Obama to speak up , even if it means driving a deeper wedge with the military .
“ I do believe it ’ d be important for the president to weigh in . He ’ s commander in chief , and I ’ m disappointed he hasn ’ t , ” said Sen. John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) , an opponent of Gillibrand ’ s amendment .
Sen. Richard Blumenthal ( D-Conn. ) , a prominent Gillibrand ally , said he can see parallels for Obama between sexual assault and two other Pentagon moves : ending “ don ’ t ask , don ’ t tell ” and opening up combat roles to women . Both faced strong resistance from the military generals , but he predicted the brass would follow Obama if he did come out in favor of Gillibrand ’ s amendment .
“ Presidential leadership is the ultimate power when it comes to the military , ” Blumenthal said . “ To their credit , the military will follow the president ’ s lead . So there ’ s huge potential for the president to lead on this issue if he chooses to do so . ”","Martin Dempsey and Chuck Hagel have publicly been vocal on the issue.

Like good soldiers, Hagel and Dempsey have been busy since, writing new rules on troop harassment, checking in on progress every week and pretty much prodding everyone, civilian and enlisted, to pick up their game.

But privately, military officials also are trying to be realistic about what they can do — and the rhetoric they’re using and the policy prescriptions they’re advocating fall well below the goals set for them by their commander in chief.

“I’d say this conversation, this response, is better framed in how far can we go to mitigate this issue because eradicating it is not even in the realm of possible,” a senior Pentagon official acknowledged to POLITICO this summer.

The seeming disconnect between Obama and his top Pentagon advisers is not only not surprising, it follows a historical trend. Military leaders frequently differ from their civilian bosses on the big social issues of the time.

Harry Truman’s battles with the generals culminated in an executive order integrating African-Americans into the military. Bill Clinton’s 1992 campaign promise allowing gays in the military turned into the “don’t ask, don’t tell” compromise when military brass, led by Gen. Colin Powell, balked. Obama allowed women into combat roles, ending decades of incremental change and bureaucratic foot-dragging.

With sexual assault, once again there is daylight between a president and the Pentagon’s top commanders — and, again, over how to solve a problem that the armed forces has faced for decades.

Dempsey and the military brass are urging the Senate to use caution before making some of the changes they are considering making on sexual assault as soon as this week as part of the annual defense authorization bill. Their opposition centers around a far-reaching plan from Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) that would remove the chain of command from prosecuting sexual assaults and other major crimes.

As the Defense Department’s first enlisted combat veteran to serve as secretary, Hagel also has advocated against rocking the boat. He’s said repeatedly that he’s open to any good ideas from Congress. But he’s also personally lobbied senators to vote against Gillibrand’s amendment, testifying this spring that he didn’t think it would be smart to eliminate the military’s command structure from the military’s justice system.

“Because it is the culture. It is the institution. It’s the people within that institution that have to fix the problem, and that’s the culture. The people are the culture. So I don’t know how you disconnect that from the accountability of command,” Hagel told the Senate Budget Committee in June.

Obama, meantime, has left plenty to the imagination, in much the same way Clinton did 20 years ago on gays in the military. The president told Hagel and Dempsey earlier this year to “leave no stone unturned” when looking at the legislative options. He’s got some of his top advisers on the issue, including Vice President Joe Biden, Valerie Jarrett and Michelle Obama’s chief of staff.

But Obama also has taken no public position on the Gillibrand amendment. That’s allowed him to avoid angering the generals he needs to carry out their military orders, but it’s left frustrated some of the women’s groups that twice helped elect him.

“I think he’s probably in an uncomfortable situation,” said retired Brig. Gen. Dennis McGinnis, a former Obama Defense Department appointee who supports Gillibrand’s proposal. “He’s looking for guidance from the brass and the brass is trying to let the system work itself out.”

The brass no doubt are trying to clean up the ranks from within. Hagel meets weekly for an hour with the Pentagon’s sexual assault team to hear what each of the branches is doing to tackle the problem. Dempsey, who acknowledged taking his “eye off the ball” during a decade of wars, is working the topic too.

“He’s got Syria, Iran, Afghanistan and the rest of the world to worry about, and he and I talk about this issue all the time. That’s a fundamental change compared to last year,” Army Brig. Gen. Richard Gross, Dempsey’s top legal counsel, said this fall during testimony before a congressionally chartered panel studying the issue.

But the Pentagon’s interests also are different from those of Obama and the civilians he has put in charge. Richard Socarides, a former Clinton White House aide who worked on “don’t ask, don’t tell,” said that’s reason enough for the president to look elsewhere for advice.

“The military always thinks it knows what’s best when it comes to their own and at most will humor the civilian leadership by listening to their views, but thereafter pretty much they do whatever they want,” he said.

Military officials note they come at the issue from a different perspective, knowing that bad actors are serving inside a population that’s mostly young, mostly male and far away from family, friends and familiar surroundings. Inside the ranks is a macho, alcohol-filled environment where sexual assaults do happen.

The military is also a conservative institution at its core, where its way of handling a problem doesn’t even come close to the common response of political leaders more familiar with polls and election strategies.

It’s a split that “gets to the heart of how units are organized, constituted and disciplined,” said Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow and defense expert at the Brookings Institution.

“Saying an officer can’t handle sexual assault within his or her unit is akin to saying that the officer can’t handle his unit … and challenges the core notion that a commander must be responsible for all that his or her subordinates do in combat and more broadly,” O’Hanlon said.

Looking at the responses from Obama, Hagel and the Pentagon generals on the issue, O’Hanlon said he sees a “bit of a divide on the understanding of the severity of the problem.”

“Uniformed military personnel don’t tolerate sexual assault as a rule, but they also know the vast majority of personnel don’t commit such acts,” he said. “They intuitively sense what the statistics show, that this may not be more of a problem in the military than elsewhere in society. By contrast, civilians are reacting to learning about a new problem they didn’t understand before. So their instinct is to try to do something about it.”

For the military leaders aggressively fighting Gillibrand, the changes would be dramatic if the Senate adopted her proposal and Obama ultimately signed it into law.

A slate of military lawyers would have final say instead of commanders about who faces court-martial. That matters to the career brass who would be “losing power personally” long after the current administration leaves office, said Rachel VanLandingham, a former lawyer for the Air Force Judge Advocate General’s Corps who worked as a chief legal adviser to U.S. Central Command under Dempsey and Gen. David Petraeus.

“They are commanders, who will individually and collectively have their prosecutorial power taken away in a wide swath of cases if Sen. Gillibrand’s legislation wins the day. And they and their subordinate commanders have to continue to lead troops and maintain good order and discipline the day after such change,” she said.

“Secretary Hagel isn’t losing anything, except perhaps the support of his Joint Chiefs, and isn’t leading troops — isn’t directly responsible for their lives in the way commanders such as Gen. Dempsey has been — today or tomorrow,” VanLandingham added.

Retired Maj. Gen. John Altenburg Jr., a former Army deputy Judge Advocate General, agreed that it’s the complicated implementation of the Gillibrand proposal that helps explain the difference in reaction between the White House and Pentagon military leaders.

“There’s always some daylight there,” he said. “For me, it’s explained by the fact that these are the people who have to go do it. They understand better than anybody else the implications of change and how many resources it requires to make a change.”

Denise Krepp, a retired Coast Guard officer and former Obama chief counsel at the U.S. Maritime Administration, said she’d like to see the president “take a strong stand” on Gillibrand’s amendment, though she’s also not surprised he’s stayed out of it so far in deference to the brass.

“They’re going to give him a very strong argument that any deviation would create chaos,” she said.

While Obama has avoided angering the military and parts of his political base, his continued silence has also left room for others around him to steal the spotlight.

Two of his female nominees to top military posts have already gotten stuck in the Senate because of their work on the sexual assault issue.

Lt. Gen. Susan Helms, tapped to be the No. 2 leader at the Air Force Space Command, recently opted for retirement rather than wait any longer for Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) to lift a hold she placed on the nomination last spring. Helms got in McCaskill’s cross hairs for overturning a jury conviction in 2012 on a sexual assault case.

Gillibrand has also blocked Jo Ann Rooney to be undersecretary of the Navy because of written testimony she delivered to a Senate committee, indicating she’d weigh a unit’s morale among the reasons for deciding whether to prosecute a sexual assault case — not just the evidence.

Then there’s Jeh Johnson, Obama’s first-term Pentagon general counsel, now awaiting Senate confirmation to become the next Homeland Security secretary. Earlier this year, after leaving his Defense Department job but before his latest nomination, Johnson questioned the integrity of the Pentagon’s current prosecution system in an appearance on MSNBC.

“The problem, I believe, has become so pervasive, the bad behavior is so pervasive, we need to look at fundamental change in the military justice system itself,” Johnson told Rachel Maddow.

For the senators who have heard plenty from the Pentagon concerning its opposition to the amendment, they say now is the time for Obama to speak up, even if it means driving a deeper wedge with the military.

“I do believe it’d be important for the president to weigh in. He’s commander in chief, and I’m disappointed he hasn’t,” said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), an opponent of Gillibrand’s amendment.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a prominent Gillibrand ally, said he can see parallels for Obama between sexual assault and two other Pentagon moves: ending “don’t ask, don’t tell” and opening up combat roles to women. Both faced strong resistance from the military generals, but he predicted the brass would follow Obama if he did come out in favor of Gillibrand’s amendment.

“Presidential leadership is the ultimate power when it comes to the military,” Blumenthal said. “To their credit, the military will follow the president’s lead. So there’s huge potential for the president to lead on this issue if he chooses to do so.”",www.politico.com,left,yM21KDhl68vqGgX1
