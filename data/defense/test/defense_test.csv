Mr. Obama is keeping 5,500 troops in Afghanistan beyond his presidency , about half the strength recommended by his top general in-country . It marks the sixth time he has rejected the advice of a ground commander on the force size in the long Iraq and Afghanistan wars . Military experts call that streak unprecedented for a commander in chief .
Like the current 9,800 U.S. troops there , the drawdown force of 5,500 will maintain a noncombat stance in training Afghan forces and hunting al Qaeda terrorists , Mr. Obama said Thursday . Administration officials said the U.S. will spend about $ 14.6 billion a year to house the troops at a total of four bases in Kabul , Kandahar , Jalalabad and Bagram — an increase over the estimated $ 10 billion annual cost of keeping a force at the U.S. Embassy in the Afghan capital .
The president had wanted to deliver a speech saying that all American troops were out of Afghanistan at the end of next year , as he did in 2011 for the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq . But he was swayed by the dark picture of the Afghan conflict that the top brass has been drawing for him , and now Mr. Obama will pass the war onto the next president in 2017 .
The battlefield facts delivered to the White House by Army Gen. John Campbell , the top NATO commander in Afghanistan , and other generals :
• The Taliban mounted a ferocious offensive in the 2015 “ fighting season ” that took a heavy casualty toll on the shaky Afghan National Security Forces .
• Those forces still lack competent leaders to win decisive battles without American troops to guide them .
• A new enemy has emerged , the ultraviolent Islamic State ( also known as ISIL or ISIS ) in a province next door to Kabul , the Afghan capital . This confronted the elected government with new security threats , especially the terrorist army ’ s trademark vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices .
“ The security situation in Afghanistan is so far from stable that to pull out all the troops , even for this president , doesn ’ t make any sense , ” said retired Army Gen. John Keane , who devised the 2007 Iraq troop surge and has advised Afghan commanders in the past .
Mr. Keane , whose guidance is sought by Congress , said Gen. Campbell wanted to retain the current force of 9,800 , but Mr. Obama “ cut that in half . ”
“ He still does not listen to his combat field general , who wanted the current force to remain as is , ” Mr. Keane said . “ Quite unprecedented , this is the sixth time President Obama has not listened to a field commander recommendation on force levels for troops in combat . ”
The six times : Mr. Obama rejected a recommendation from Army Gen. Lloyd Austin , chief of U.S. Central Command , to keep about 20,000 troops in Iraq ; at five transition points in Afghanistan , he approved troop numbers below those urged by commanders .
Still , Mr. Obama did compromise on troops and infrastructure instead of ordering the complete withdrawal he had wanted .
“ The goodness in this decision are the four bases , ” Mr. Keane said . “ If he had reduced it to one base , which they were thinking of doing , that would be a disaster .
“ The four bases permits the military to conduct counterterrorism operations in the east , south and in vicinity of the capital , which is absolutely critical , one of the crucial capabilities we lost when we pulled all troops out of Iraq , ” he said . “ Also , the four bases permits the next president to expand the troop presence rapidly based on the security situation 15 months from now .
“ What suffers as a result of this decision is the train-and-assist mission , because we won ’ t have sufficient troops to do it properly , ” the retired general said .
Train-and-assist is one of three major missions now carried out by American forces . The other two : advise and accompany Afghan forces on counterterrorism operations and provide force protection .
On Thursday , the administration defended the president against criticism that he ignored the advice of his top military advisers , with White House press secretary Josh Earnest saying that Mr. Obama ’ s decision is “ consistent with ” Gen. Campbell ’ s recommendation .
It is likely that Gen. Campbell ’ s communications with the White House in recent months mirrored the somber report he delivered Oct. 6 to the Senate Armed Services Committee .
There he spoke of a “ struggling ” Afghan force that faced its longest fighting season as the Taliban began early — in February . In the east , the Islamic State “ further complicated the theater landscape and potentially expanded the conflict , ” Gen. Campbell said .
All the while , he said , the Afghans lacked the robust U.S. air power they had come to rely on to arrive on the scene in minutes and deliver precision fire . Such air support “ is no longer the norm but the exception , ” he said .
The commander ’ s report card on the Afghan force : “ They must improve their intelligence fusion , command and control utilization of their forces . They don ’ t possess the necessary combat power and numbers to protect every part of the country . This makes it very difficult for the Afghan security forces to counter the Taliban ’ s ability to temporarily seize an objective and then blend back into the population . ”
Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford , the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , is now Mr. Obama ’ s chief military adviser .
During his July confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee , Gen. Dunford all but broke with the president ’ s then-desire to pull all troops out by the end of 2016 . One could extrapolate from his answers to questions from committee Chairman John McCain , Arizona Republican , that he would attempt to talk the president out of that plan .
“ Is this a wise decision on your part to have a calendar-based withdrawal of American troops rather than a condition-based withdrawal given your background and experience there ? ” Mr. McCain asked Gen. Dunford , a former Afghan NATO commander .
“ I ’ m aware of the consequences of our mission and importance of our mission in Afghanistan , ” the general answered . “ I can assure you , if I ’ m confirmed , I ’ ll provide advice to the president that will allow us to meet our desired end state . And I think that that will be based on the conditions on the ground , as you ’ ve articulated . ”
Mr. McCain said Thursday “ it makes no military sense to withdraw U.S. forces ” below the current 9,800 .
“ Once again , President Obama is putting our mission in Afghanistan , as well as our men and women serving there , at greater risk , and he is doing so for the sake of a troop reduction that has no political benefit but could have significant military implications , ” he said .","In the end, President Obama was forced to listen to his generals — not his political instincts — on Afghanistan troop levels, and he decided to split the difference.

Ambassador Chris Stevens .
Rep. Peter King , chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee , said Saturday that Mr. Petraeus ‘ testimony is “ essential . ”
“ I strongly believe that General Petreaus has to testify , if not this week , then the following week or sometime very soon because it ’ s not the CIA director who has to testify , it ’ s the person who was involved at the time of Benghazi . And that was David Petraeus , ” the New York congressman told Fox News .
Mr. Petraeus stepped down as CIA director on Friday , citing an extramarital affair in his resignation letter , but Republicans , including Mr. King , contend that the retired four-star general ’ s resignation should not preclude him from speaking to House and Senate committees looking into the Obama administration ’ s handling of the Sept. 11 attacks .
The acting director of the CIA , Mike Morell , is expected to take the general ’ s place at the closed door intelligence committee hearings set for Thursday on Capitol Hill .
On Friday night , Rep. Trey Gowdy , South Carolina Republican , said Congress would subpoena the general if necessary .
“ The fact that he ’ s resigned and had an affair has nothing to do with whether or not he ’ s going be subpoenaed to Congress , ” Mr. Gowdy said on Fox News . “ I hope we don ’ t have to subpoena a four-star general and the former CIA director . I hope he would come voluntarily . But if he won ’ t , he will be subpoenaed and none of what has happened today is a defense to a subpoena . ”
Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani joined a chorus of Republicans questioning the timing the resignation – just days after the re-election of President Obama .
The former GOP presidential nominee on Fox News said the Petraeus resignation is the latest example of the Obama administration ’ s “ suppression ” of information .
“ Now we ’ re going to have a hearing next week , and the man who knows the facts , David Petraeus – he ’ s the only man who can really tell us what the CIA knew , what they did , why they did it , how they did it – he ’ s not going to testify . This is a very convenient way to get the administration out of a very very difficult situation , ” Mr. Giuliani said .
“ But this is inevitable . This is like Watergate . This is all going to come out . It may take a month , it may take five months . But this is all going to come out . And every single new coverup they do just makes it much much worse . ”
Gen. Petraeus and other intelligence officials had been scheduled to appear before closed-door sessions of the House and Senate intelligence committees on Thursday to answer questions about the administration ’ s handling of the Sept. 11 terror attack in Benghazi .
Mr. King , like many Republicans this week , said he has unanswered questions about the timing of the resignation .
“ I have a hard time accepting the whole story , ” the New York congressman said Saturday on MSNBC .
The general , 60 , carried on the affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell , a reserve Army officer , according to the Associated Press . The FBI discovered the relationship by monitoring Mr. Petraeus ‘ emails , after being alerted Ms. Broadwell may have had access to his personal email account .
Mr. King and other Republicans joined Democrats in praising the general ’ s service to the country .
In a statement from the White House , President Obama said Mr. Petraeus , who took over as CIA director in September 2011 , had provided “ extraordinary service to the United States for decades ” and had given a lifetime of service that “ made our country safer and stronger . ”
The general , considered one of the nation ’ s smartest and most capable military men , is credited with salvaging the Iraq war .
“ His inspirational leadership and his genius were directly responsible – after years of failure – for the success of the surge in Iraq , ” Sen. John McCain , Arizona Republican , said Friday .","One day after President Obama accepted the resignation of CIA Director David Petraeus, Republicans say the general is still expected to answer congressional questions about the Obama administration’s handling of the Sept. 11 terror attacks in Libya that claimed the lives of four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens.

Mr. Petraeus stepped down as CIA director on Friday, citing an extramarital affair in his resignation letter, but Republicans, including Mr. King, contend that the retired four-star general’s resignation should not preclude him from speaking to House and Senate committees looking into the Obama administration’s handling of the Sept. 11 attacks.

The acting director of the CIA, Mike Morell, is expected to take the general’s place at the closed door intelligence committee hearings set for Thursday on Capitol Hill.

On Friday night, Rep. Trey Gowdy, South Carolina Republican, said Congress would subpoena the general if necessary.

“The fact that he’s resigned and had an affair has nothing to do with whether or not he’s going be subpoenaed to Congress,” Mr. Gowdy said on Fox News. “I hope we don’t have to subpoena a four-star general and the former CIA director. I hope he would come voluntarily. But if he won’t, he will be subpoenaed and none of what has happened today is a defense to a subpoena.”

Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani joined a chorus of Republicans questioning the timing the resignation – just days after the re-election of President Obama.

The former GOP presidential nominee on Fox News said the Petraeus resignation is the latest example of the Obama administration’s “suppression” of information.

“Now we’re going to have a hearing next week, and the man who knows the facts, David Petraeus – he’s the only man who can really tell us what the CIA knew, what they did, why they did it, how they did it – he’s not going to testify. This is a very convenient way to get the administration out of a very very difficult situation,” Mr. Giuliani said.

“But this is inevitable. This is like Watergate. This is all going to come out. It may take a month, it may take five months. But this is all going to come out. And every single new coverup they do just makes it much much worse.”

Gen. Petraeus and other intelligence officials had been scheduled to appear before closed-door sessions of the House and Senate intelligence committees on Thursday to answer questions about the administration’s handling of the Sept. 11 terror attack in Benghazi.

Mr. King, like many Republicans this week, said he has unanswered questions about the timing of the resignation.

“I have a hard time accepting the whole story,” the New York congressman said Saturday on MSNBC.

The general, 60, carried on the affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell, a reserve Army officer, according to the Associated Press. The FBI discovered the relationship by monitoring Mr. Petraeus‘ emails, after being alerted Ms. Broadwell may have had access to his personal email account.

Mr. King and other Republicans joined Democrats in praising the general’s service to the country.

In a statement from the White House, President Obama said Mr. Petraeus, who took over as CIA director in September 2011, had provided “extraordinary service to the United States for decades” and had given a lifetime of service that “made our country safer and stronger.”

The general, considered one of the nation’s smartest and most capable military men, is credited with salvaging the Iraq war.

“His inspirational leadership and his genius were directly responsible – after years of failure – for the success of the surge in Iraq,” Sen. John McCain, Arizona Republican, said Friday.

The Center for Constitutional Rights:

We are outraged that a whistleblower and a patriot has been sentenced on a conviction under the Espionage Act. The government has stretched this archaic and discredited law to send an unmistakable warning to potential whistleblowers and journalists willing to publish their information. We can only hope that Manning’s courage will continue to inspire others who witness state crimes to speak up.

This show trial was a frontal assault on the First Amendment, from the way the prosecution twisted Manning’s actions to blur the distinction between whistleblowing and spying to the government’s tireless efforts to obstruct media coverage of the proceedings. It is a travesty of justice that Manning, who helped bring to light the criminality of U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, is being punished while the alleged perpetrators of the crimes he exposed are not even investigated. Every aspect of this case sets a dangerous precedent for future prosecutions of whistleblowers – who play an essential role in democratic government by telling us the truth about government wrongdoing – and we fear for the future of our country in the wake of this case.

We must channel our outrage and continue building political pressure for Manning’s freedom. President Obama should pardon Bradley Manning, and if he refuses, a presidential pardon must be an election issue in 2016.

Ben Wizner of the American Civil Liberties Union:

When a soldier who shared information with the press and public is punished far more harshly than others who tortured prisoners and killed civilians, something is seriously wrong with our justice system. A legal system that doesn’t distinguish between leaks to the press in the public interest and treason against the nation will not only produce unjust results, but will deprive the public of critical information that is necessary for democratic accountability. This is a sad day for Bradley Manning, but it’s also a sad day for all Americans who depend on brave whistleblowers and a free press for a fully informed public debate.

Widney Brown of Amnesty International:

Bradley Manning acted on the belief that he could spark a meaningful public debate on the costs of war, and specifically on the conduct of the US military in Iraq and Afghanistan. His revelations included reports on battlefield detentions and previously unseen footage of journalists and other civilians being killed in US helicopter attacks, information which should always have been subject to public scrutiny.

Instead of fighting tooth and nail to lock him up for the equivalent of several life sentences, the US government should turn its attention to investigating and delivering justice for the serious human rights abuses committed by its officials in the name of countering terror.

Manning had already pleaded guilty to leaking information, so for the US to have continued prosecuting him under the Espionage Act, even charging him with ‘aiding the enemy,’ can only be seen as a harsh warning to anyone else tempted to expose government wrongdoing. More than anything else, the case shows the urgent need to reform the USA’s antiquated Espionage Act and strengthen protections for those who reveal information that the public has a need and a right to know.

Bradley Manning should be shown clemency in recognition of his motives for acting as he did, the treatment he endured in his early pre-trial detention, and the due process shortcomings during his trial. The President doesn’t need to wait for this sentence to be appealed to commute it; he can and should do so right now.

The new budget , if it were to be approved by Congress , will take the Army down to pre-World War II levels – a good idea given that the US military is not likely to be waging troop-intensive nation-building operations for some time to come , Secretary Hagel said during a briefing with reporters .
What ’ s more , “ given the Army ’ s reliance on contractors to do things once performed by active-duty personnel , ” these cuts do not “ necessarily mean the Army will be less capable , ” says Benjamin Freeman , policy adviser for the National Security Project at Third Way , a think tank in Washington , D.C. “ Personnel numbers only tell one part of the story . ”
Although reaction to the budget plan within the Beltway can tend to run toward the dire , particularly among defense contractors , “ one doubts that the American public are terribly worried about a military that might be slightly less likely to get involved in unnecessary and counterproductive nation-building missions in distant lands , ” argues Christopher Preble , a defense analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute think tank .
Under the budget plan for fiscal year 2015 , the Army would decline from a post-Iraq high of 566,000 in 2011 to some 440,000 active-duty troops by 2019 . The post-World War II low was 475,290 in 1999 , Dr. Freeman notes .
“ Given rapidly rising personnel costs , and the great political difficulty of reining them in , the only way to achieve actual savings may be a smaller active-duty force , ” Mr. Preble adds .
That 's in effect what Hagel is proposing . “ Our recommendations favor a smaller and more capable force , putting a premium on rapidly deployable , self-sustaining platforms that can defeat more technologically advanced adversaries , ” he said .
Even with the cuts , the Army still would be just above the force levels it had prior to 9/11 . The proposed cuts , moreover , are not nearly as deep as the Army had contemplated during a strategic review last summer , notes Todd Harrison , senior fellow in defense studies at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments .
That signals that the Army and the Marine Corps are prioritizing higher numbers of troops over acquiring modern technology , he adds .
At the same time , the Navy will retain its 11 aircraft carriers , while the Air Force will continue to prioritize the F-35 fighter jet , the next-generation stealth fighter .
Rather than putting their money on higher force levels , the Navy and the Air Force are emphasizing high-tech modernization , Mr. Harrison says . “ The real story here for me is this looks like a giant balancing act . ”
Special Operations Forces would get a boost , too – from 66,000 troops today to 69,700 in the new budget . “ Clearly , Special Operations Forces have been very effective in what we ’ ve been doing in Iraq and Afghanistan , and in terrorism operations around the globe , ” Harrison says .
What is not included in the budget are the sequestration cuts already mandated by Congress , or the overseas continuing operations ( OCO ) , which is where the Pentagon keeps the funding for the war in Afghanistan .

“ The OCO has really become , frankly , a slush fund , ” Freeman says , adding that defense analysts will be watching carefully when the Pentagon rolls it out , probably after the presidential election in Afghanistan in April .
But defense officials are eventually going to have to make some tough decisions on the cost of the war , or face the wrath of some lawmakers . Adds Preble : “ If the Pentagon isn ’ t serious about confronting '' the high cost of the war , as well as looming sequestration , `` the resulting infighting could get ugly . ”","With Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announcing Monday a historic downsizing of US ground forces, along with other cost-cutting measures, what does the move say about military priorities at the end of two long wars?

What’s more, “given the Army’s reliance on contractors to do things once performed by active-duty personnel,” these cuts do not “necessarily mean the Army will be less capable,” says Benjamin Freeman, policy adviser for the National Security Project at Third Way, a think tank in Washington, D.C. “Personnel numbers only tell one part of the story.”

Although reaction to the budget plan within the Beltway can tend to run toward the dire, particularly among defense contractors, “one doubts that the American public are terribly worried about a military that might be slightly less likely to get involved in unnecessary and counterproductive nation-building missions in distant lands,” argues Christopher Preble, a defense analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute think tank.

Under the budget plan for fiscal year 2015, the Army would decline from a post-Iraq high of 566,000 in 2011 to some 440,000 active-duty troops by 2019. The post-World War II low was 475,290 in 1999, Dr. Freeman notes.

“Given rapidly rising personnel costs, and the great political difficulty of reining them in, the only way to achieve actual savings may be a smaller active-duty force,” Mr. Preble adds.

That's in effect what Hagel is proposing. “Our recommendations favor a smaller and more capable force, putting a premium on rapidly deployable, self-sustaining platforms that can defeat more technologically advanced adversaries,” he said.

Even with the cuts, the Army still would be just above the force levels it had prior to 9/11. The proposed cuts, moreover, are not nearly as deep as the Army had contemplated during a strategic review last summer, notes Todd Harrison, senior fellow in defense studies at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.

That signals that the Army and the Marine Corps are prioritizing higher numbers of troops over acquiring modern technology, he adds.

At the same time, the Navy will retain its 11 aircraft carriers, while the Air Force will continue to prioritize the F-35 fighter jet, the next-generation stealth fighter.

Rather than putting their money on higher force levels, the Navy and the Air Force are emphasizing high-tech modernization, Mr. Harrison says. “The real story here for me is this looks like a giant balancing act.”

Special Operations Forces would get a boost, too – from 66,000 troops today to 69,700 in the new budget. “Clearly, Special Operations Forces have been very effective in what we’ve been doing in Iraq and Afghanistan, and in terrorism operations around the globe,” Harrison says.

What is not included in the budget are the sequestration cuts already mandated by Congress, or the overseas continuing operations (OCO), which is where the Pentagon keeps the funding for the war in Afghanistan.

“The OCO has really become, frankly, a slush fund,” Freeman says, adding that defense analysts will be watching carefully when the Pentagon rolls it out, probably after the presidential election in Afghanistan in April.

But defense officials are eventually going to have to make some tough decisions on the cost of the war, or face the wrath of some lawmakers.

Obama said he will count on Hagel's ""counsel and judgment"" as the United States ends combat operations in Afghanistan and stays ""ready to meet the threats of our time.""

The task for Hagel , 66, going forward is to swiftly move past the protracted nomination battle, prove himself a strong and capable Pentagon chief, and repair relationships on Capitol Hill, said Fran Townsend, a former homeland security adviser to President George W. Bush.

""Of course, when he walks through the door he is bruised and battered. But I think we shouldn't overestimate the impact of that,"" Townsend said.

With Hagel's confirmation, Obama has put in place another crucial piece of his second-term national security team. John Kerry has been installed as secretary of state and John Brennan is awaiting Senate action on his nomination to be CIA director. Thomas Donilon is already serving as national security adviser.

O'Hanlon said Hagel would not ""be damaged goods"" and the political outcry over his nomination would quickly be overshadowed by the latest budget drama engulfing Washington over spending cuts, which would hit the Pentagon hard, if enacted.

Bad feelings about Hagel stem, in part, from his 2007 comments that the ""Jewish lobby intimidated lawmakers."" Republicans who are already uncomfortable with Obama's policies toward Israel are uneasy about a defense secretary holding such views.

Israel's ambassador to the United States, Michael Oren, said in a statement that Israel ""looks forward to working closely"" with Hagel.

Hagel's criticism of the Iraq War, the Patriot Act, and his past positions on Iran and on U.S. military intervention also raised red flags with his opponents.

Moreover, he spoke about an ambassadorial nominee in the late 1990s as being ""openly, ggressively gay,"" remarks for which he has since apologized. Obama ended the prohibition on gays and lesbians serving openly in the military.

And Hagel hasn't been sparing in his criticism of conservative and GOP figures, saying radio show hosts like Rush Limbaugh ""try to rip everybody down"" but ""don't have any answers,"" and labeling George W. Bush as callous on Iraq when he was president.

Last week, 15 GOP senators sent a letter to Obama calling on him to withdraw Hagel's nomination.

Arizona Sen. John McCain, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee and a fierce Hagel critic, did not sign the letter. But he led the charge against him in the Senate, stalling the nomination at one point in exchange for more information from the White House on the deadly September terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya.

That sentiment gained traction in conservative circles.

""There is simply no way to sugar coat it. Senator Hagel's performance before the Senate Armed Services Committee was remarkably inept and we should not be installing a defense secretary who is obviously not qualified for the job and who holds dangerously misguided views on some of the most important issues facing national security policy for our country,"" said Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas.

There was a healthy serving of politics behind the Hagel pushback, some experts say. He isn't the only potential member of Obama's first or second-term Cabinet to be grilled during the nomination process.

At the start of his first term, Obama's pick to lead the Treasury Department, Timothy Geithner, emerged from a tough confirmation fight in the wake of recession to help push through Wall Street reform as well as the banking and auto industry rescues. His successor, Jack Lew, is expected to be confirmed.

Some Republicans also believed that Hagel, like Susan Rice, was vulnerable in a divided political climate in Washington made more sharply partisan by Obama's re-election, according to experts.

Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, withdrew her name from consideration for secretary of state after drawing heavy criticism from McCain and other Republicans over her public statements about the Benghazi attack.

Democratic supporters of Hagel came to his defense this week as the vote drew near.

""The president wants him in the room as he's making important decisions. There's no question about his integrity of character. I think the president deserves to have the Cabinet he wants as long as the person is qualified,"" Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill said on ""Fox News Sunday.""

The consternation over Hagel's confirmation has been ""kabuki theater,"" said David Rothkopf, editor of Foreign Policy magazine.

""The political divisions that dictated the pace and twists of his confirmation process pre-date him and will post-date his confirmation,"" Rothkopf said. ""The reality is that Hagel won't drive (defense) policy, the president and Hill politics will.""

And time will heal even these political wounds, Rothkopf said.",www.cnn.com,left,yQZuWDY3eSVrB2o7

David Petraeus and to his abrupt resignation Friday as Central Intelligence Agency chief .
The emails began arriving in Jill Kelley 's inbox in May , U.S. officials familiar with the probe said . Ms. Kelley , who helped organize social events at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa , Fla. , told the Federal Bureau of Investigation about the emails , which she viewed as harassing , the U.S. officials said .
That FBI investigation into who sent the emails led over a period of months to Paula Broadwell , Mr. Petraeus 's biographer , with whom he was having an extramarital affair , according to the U.S. officials .
FBI agents were pursuing what they thought was a potential cybercrime , or a breach of classified information .

Mr. Petraeus admitted to an affair in a letter to CIA employees announcing his resignation .
In the aftermath of the investigation , some lawmakers are aiming criticism at the FBI and the Obama administration , including Attorney General Eric Holder , who knew about the email link to Mr. Petraeus as far back as late summer . A House Republican leader also learned of the matter in October . Some argue that Mr. Petraeus should n't have resigned ; others said that the FBI should have formally notified Congress earlier .
The top Senate Democrat on intelligence issues said Sunday she would investigate the FBI 's handling of the inquiry , and why the matter was n't shared earlier with Congress .
Felled by Scandal There is a long list of leaders felled by allegations of personal or ethical lapses in recent years , including the CIA 's David Petraeus and Lockheed Martin 's Christopher Kubasik .
`` It was like a lightning bolt , '' said Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D. , Calif. ) on `` Fox News Sunday . '' `` This is something that could have had an effect on national security . I think we should have been told . ''
That Mr. Petraeus was having an affair was n't the point of the FBI probe , according to the U.S. officials briefed on the matter .
The FBI investigation began with five to 10 emails beginning around May and received by Ms. Kelley , according to U.S. officials .
The precise nature of Ms. Kelley 's relationships with Ms. Broadwell and Mr. Petraeus , who ran the Tampa-based U.S. Central Command from 2008 to 2010 , were n't known Sunday . Attempts to reach Ms. Broadwell and Ms. Kelley were unsuccessful .
In a statement Sunday , according to the Associated Press , Ms. Kelley and her husband , Scott , said they and their family `` have been friends with General Petraeus and his family for over five years '' and asked for privacy .
Ms. Kelley did n't know who sent the emails . Some appeared to be accusing her of an inappropriate relationship but did n't name Mr. Petraeus . Agents determined the emails were sent from an account shared by Ms. Broadwell and her husband , who live in North Carolina , the officials said .

But the agents spent weeks piecing together who may have sent them . They used metadata footprints left by the emails to determine what locations they were sent from . They matched the places , including hotels , where Ms. Broadwell was during the times the emails were sent .
FBI agents and federal prosecutors used the information as probable cause to seek a warrant to monitor Ms. Broadwell 's email accounts .
They learned that Ms. Broadwell and Mr. Petraeus had set up private Gmail accounts to use for their communications , which included explicit details of a sexual nature , according to U.S. officials . But because Mr. Petraeus used a pseudonym , agents doing the monitoring did n't immediately uncover that he was the one communicating with Ms. Broadwell .
By late summer , after the monitoring of Ms. Broadwell 's emails uncovered the link to Mr. Petraeus , prosecutors and agents alerted senior officials at FBI and the Justice Department , including Mr. Holder , U.S. officials say . The investigators never monitored Mr. Petraeus 's email accounts , the officials say .
In September , prosecutors and agents began a legal analysis to determine whether there were any charges that could be brought . Among the discussions : whether to interview Ms. Broadwell , who was the focus of the criminal probe , and Mr. Petraeus .
Top officials signed off on the interviews , which occurred in late September and October , just before the U.S. presidential election . During Ms. Broadwell 's first interview in September , she admitted to the affair and turned over her computer , the officials said .
On her computer , investigators found classified documents , the U.S. officials said , a discovery that raised new concerns .
At Mr. Petraeus 's interview in the week before the election , he also admitted the affair and said he had n't provided the classified documents to Ms. Broadwell . Agents conducted a second interview with Ms. Broadwell on Nov. 2 . She also said Mr. Petraeus was n't the source of the documents .
That information helped resolve concerns that there was a national-security breach , although the source of the documents had n't been determined . The officials offered no specifics about what was in the documents .
Despite efforts at FBI and the Justice Department to keep the investigation closely held , word of it leaked to a small number of lawmakers . Rep. David Reichert ( R. , Wash. ) received a tip from an FBI employee that there was a national-security issue related to Mr. Petraeus , according to an aide . He forwarded the information to House Majority Leader Eric Cantor ( R. , Va. ) , who alerted the FBI in October .
`` I was contacted by an FBI employee [ who was ] concerned that sensitive , classified information may have been compromised and made certain Director [ Robert ] Mueller was aware of these serious allegations and the potential risk to our national security , '' Mr. Cantor said in a statement , which was reported by the New York Times on Sunday .
FBI and Justice Department officials reassessed their investigation over the next several days and determined there was n't sufficient cause to bring charges . They advised the Director of National Intelligence of their findings at about 5 p.m. Tuesday , Election Day .
Shawn Turner , a spokesman for Director of National Intelligence James Clapper , said Mr. Clapper spoke with Mr. Petraeus that evening and the following day and urged him to step down .
`` Speaking as a friend , colleague and fellow general officer , Gen. Clapper urged Gen. Petraeus to step down , '' Mr. Turner said . Mr. Clapper is a retired Air Force lieutenant general , and Mr. Petraeus retired from the Army as a four-star general before assuming the helm at CIA .
Mr. Clapper informed the White House on Wednesday that Mr. Petraeus was considering resigning , Mr. Turner said .
Mr. Obama learned of the affair Thursday morning and met that day with Mr. Petraeus , who offered his resignation . Mr. Obama did n't immediately accept it and took a day to consider it .
An extramarital affair does n't necessarily disqualify an official from serving as director of the CIA , and there are employees at the agency who have engaged in extramarital affairs without being forced to leave the agency .
Mr. Petraeus believed he should resign because the CIA would have viewed a lower-level employee engaged in an affair to be improper and that the director should set an example by publicly accepting responsibility , according to a person familiar with the events .
The affair ended more than four months ago , though Mr. Petraeus continued to advise Ms. Broadwell on her research into innovation in the 101st Airborne Division in Northern Iraq in 2003 , which then- Maj. Gen. Petraeus commanded .
On Friday afternoon , as word began to leak out that Mr. Petraeus might be leaving his post , a shocked Ms. Feinstein , who chairs the Senate intelligence committee , called Mr. Petraeus to ask what was going on , and questioned whether it was necessary to step down . She said Sunday in the `` Fox News Sunday '' interview that , given all the details of the affair , she now believes Mr. Petraeus was right to resign .
Later Friday afternoon , Mr. Clapper 's top deputy called key congressional leaders .
Ms. Feinstein remains frustrated that she was n't told of the affair earlier . `` We should have been told , '' she said in an interview , adding that she is going to look into why the FBI , which is one of the 16 U.S. intelligence agencies , did n't notify the leaders of the intelligence committees in advance .
U.S. spy agencies are required to inform leaders of the intelligence committees of `` significant intelligence activities , '' and the affair represented the potential for a security compromise , a congressional aide said .
However , U.S. officials briefed on the matter said the probe was closely held among officials at the FBI and Justice under a long-standing policy not to divulge information on continuing criminal investigations .
The disclosure policy was reinforced in a 2007 memorandum by Michael Mukasey , who was then attorney general under President George W. Bush . The memorandum , issued in the wake of the scandal over the firings of U.S. attorneys , sought to remind department employees that contacts with the White House and Congress about pending criminal matters were off limits .
On Sunday , U.S. intelligence officials said their briefing of intelligence committee members on Friday was appropriate . `` We have a statutory requirement to keep Congress fully informed , '' a senior intelligence official said . `` We notified Congress of the situation . ''
The timing of events near the election has raised suspicions among some lawmakers that the administration was seeking to hide embarrassing news before the presidential balloting took place .
`` The FBI has a lot of explaining to do , and so does the White House , '' said Rep. Peter King ( R. , N.Y. ) , chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee . `` I have a hard time accepting most of the story we 've heard so far . It does n't add up . ''

Confirmation hearings being held for CIA director nominee John Brennan
The Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday morning will receive a classified document that seeks to justify the administration 's policy of targeting Americans overseas via drone attacks , chairwoman Dianne Feinstein said late Wednesday .
`` I am pleased that the president has agreed to provide the Intelligence Committee with access to the OLC ( Office of Legal Counsel ) opinion regarding the use of lethal force in counterterrorism operations , '' the California Democrat said in a statement .
`` It is critical for the committee 's oversight function to fully understand the legal basis for all intelligence and counterterrorism operations . ''
The announcement came shortly after an administration official said that President Barack Obama had yielded to demands that he turn over to Congress the classified Justice Department legal advice that seeks to justify the policy .
The developments came the night before confirmation hearings are to be held for Obama 's CIA director nominee , John Brennan , and amid complaints from senators , including several Democrats , about secrecy surrounding the drone policy .
`` Today , as part of the president 's ongoing commitment to consult with Congress on national security matters , the president directed the Department of Justice to provide the congressional Intelligence committees access to classified Office of Legal Counsel advice related to the subject of the Department of Justice White Paper , '' an administration official said .
The 16-page white paper -- titled `` Lawfulness of a Lethal Operation Directed Against a U.S. Citizen who is a Senior Operational Leader of Al Qaida or an Associated Force '' -- is a policy paper rather than an official legal document .
The president , the official said , was turning over the information because he believes the scrutiny and debate is healthy .
In a 2012 speech at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington , Brennan asserted that the drone strikes are legal both under the Authorization for Use of Military Force resolution passed by Congress after the September 11 attacks and because , `` There is nothing in international law that bans the use of remotely piloted aircraft for this purpose or that prohibits us from using lethal force against our enemies outside of an active battlefield , at least when the country involved consents or is unable or unwilling to take action against the threat . ''
This does not appear to be the view of Ben Emmerson , United Nations special rapporteur on counterterrorism and human rights , who announced plans in October to investigate U.S. drone attacks and the extent to which they cause civilian casualties .
The drone campaign against al Qaeda and its allies has been one of Brennan 's biggest legacies in the four years he was the president 's principal adviser on terrorism .
According to a count by the public policy group New America Foundation , at least 28 of al Qaeda 's leading members have been killed in drone strikes , including the U.S. citizen Anwar al-Awlaki , who played an operational role in al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula .
Human rights groups in the United States are particularly aggrieved by the targeted killing of al-Awlaki , who was killed by a drone . His teenage son died in a separate strike .
On Wednesday , the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee said the attack that killed al-Awlaki was justified .
`` This is somebody who had said that he did n't want his U.S. citizenship anymore , Rep. Mike Rogers , R-Michigan , told MNBC 's `` Andrea Mitchell Reports . ''
`` He had officially joined al Qaeda , '' Rogers said . `` Al Qaeda had declared war on the United States . ''
Rogers continued , `` The legal basis of this goes back many , many years when U.S. citizens would go and fight for foreign nations that were engaging in combat with the United States . So what they were saying is , once you 've made that choice , you no longer get the protections that you would . I mean , if you join the enemy overseas , you join the enemy overseas . And we 're going to fight the enemy overseas . ''
In his speech at the Wilson Center , Brennan said that drone strikes are `` ethical '' because of `` the unprecedented ability of remotely piloted aircraft to precisely target a military objective while minimizing collateral damage ; one could argue that never before has there been a weapon that allows us to distinguish more effectively between an al Qaeda terrorist and innocent civilians . ''
And Obama himself defended it in an appearance last October on `` The Daily Show . ''
`` There are times where there are bad folks somewhere on the other side of the world , and you 've got to make a call and it 's not optimal , '' he said . `` And sometimes you 've got to make some tough calls .

""This is somebody who had said that he didn't want his U.S. citizenship anymore, Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, told MNBC's ""Andrea Mitchell Reports.""

""He had officially joined al Qaeda,"" Rogers said. ""Al Qaeda had declared war on the United States.""

Rogers continued, ""The legal basis of this goes back many, many years when U.S. citizens would go and fight for foreign nations that were engaging in combat with the United States. So what they were saying is, once you've made that choice, you no longer get the protections that you would. I mean, if you join the enemy overseas, you join the enemy overseas. And we're going to fight the enemy overseas.""

In his speech at the Wilson Center, Brennan said that drone strikes are ""ethical"" because of ""the unprecedented ability of remotely piloted aircraft to precisely target a military objective while minimizing collateral damage; one could argue that never before has there been a weapon that allows us to distinguish more effectively between an al Qaeda terrorist and innocent civilians.""

And Obama himself defended it in an appearance last October on ""The Daily Show.""

""There are times where there are bad folks somewhere on the other side of the world, and you've got to make a call and it's not optimal,"" he said. ""And sometimes you've got to make some tough calls. But you can do so in a way that's consistent with international law and with American law.""",www.cnn.com,left,TE74M4qY09kyW4d5

The helicopter was first reported missing at about 8:30 p.m. ( 9:30 p.m . ET ) Tuesday . Hours later , searchers found debris around Okaloosa Island near Eglin Air Force Base , base spokesman Andy Bourland said .
This debris washed up on both the north and south sides of Santa Rosa Sound , which connects mainland northern Florida and a barrier island .
The air search is expected to resume midday Thursday , the spokesman said . A spokeswoman for the Coast Guard said that boats will continue scouring the waters throughout the night Wednesday , weather permitting .
Human remains have washed ashore in the area near Eglin .
Base spokeswoman Jasmine Porterfield did n't specify what was found , noting the search-and-rescue mission remained underway . Still , there was little hope for a miracle , with Gen. Martin Dempsey -- chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- expressing his condolences .
He said the crash was `` a reminder to us that those who serve put themselves at risk , both in training and in combat . ''
`` We will work with the services to ensure that ... their family members will be well cared for . ''
The Air Force , Coast Guard and civilian agencies participated in the intensive search focused on where they believe the aircraft went down , in waters east of the town of Navarre and the Navarre Bridge and near Eglin testing range site A-17 .
Porterfield said approximately 100 people were involved in canvassing the ground and the waters , looking for debris : `` It 's a huge effort underway . ''
`` We 're working closely with all the parties involved to locate our Marines and the Army crew that were onboard , '' added Capt . Barry Morris , a spokesman for the U.S. Marines Corps Special Operations Command . `` And , really , just our thoughts ( and ) prayers are with the Marines , the soldiers and the families of those involved in the mishap . ''
No one is saying what caused the accident , with Eglin spokeswoman Sara Vidoni indicating only that there 's no indication of anything suspicious .
There was heavy fog in the area when the aircraft went missing , though the Eglin spokeswoman said it 's too early to tell whether that had anything to do with the crash .
`` There is training in all conditions -- that 's part of the military mission , '' Vidoni said . `` They were out there doing what the military does . ''
According to Morris , the service members -- all men -- were involved in a seven-day training exercise of amphibious operations . It involved small boats and inserting and extracting Marines from the water via helicopter . Morris would not say in which phase of the training the Marines were on Tuesday night .
The UH-60 helicopter was n't alone when it went down . A second Black Hawk -- assigned to 1-244th Assault Helicopter Battalion based in Hammond , Louisiana -- safely returned to the base , some 40 miles east of Pensacola .
The aircraft were both assigned to the Louisiana Army National Guard out of Hammond and taking part in what the U.S. military called a `` routine training mission involving the Marine Special Operations Regiment '' out of Camp Lejeune .
`` Whatever the trouble was with the one aircraft , it did not involve the second helicopter that was participating in the exercise , '' Bourland said .
The Army aircrew members belonged to the Army National Guard unit out of Louisiana , part of a unit that Gov . Bobby Jindal said `` have fought courageously overseas in defense of our nation and here at home . ''
By 11:15 a.m. , relatives of all four of those guardsmen had been notified , though their names wo n't be released publicly until the Coast Guard recovers their bodies or calls off the search , said Col. Pete Schneider , a Louisiana National Guard spokesman .
`` They have protected what matters most during times of crisis , '' Jindal said . `` These soldiers represent the best of Louisiana , and we are praying for them and their families . ''
Morris said the Marines involved in the crash were all `` highly-trained '' members of that service 's special operations command . They were based out of Camp Lejeune , an expansive North Carolina base that is home to about 170,000 active deputy , dependent , retired and civilian personnel .
Black Hawk helicopters are regularly used in U.S. Army missions .
The pilots were instructor pilots , Maj. Gen. Glenn Curtis told reporters . He said the whole crew had several thousand combined hours of operation flying the Black Hawk .
In January , two Marines died when their helicopter went down at the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in Twentynine Palms , California .
And last March , an F/A-18C Hornet 's pilot died after a crash about 70 miles east of Naval Air Station Fallon in western Nevada .
This week 's crash involved a UH-60 Black Hawk , a twin-engine helicopter introduced into Army service in 1979 in place of the iconic UH-1 Huey . Other branches have modified the Black Hawk for their own uses , including the Navy 's SH-60 ( the Sea Hawk ) , the Air Force 's MH-60 ( the Pave Hawk ) and the Coast Guard 's HH-60 ( the Jayhawk ) .
The Army 's UH-60 helicopter , which has a maximum speed of 173 mph , has an airframe `` designed to progressively crush on impact to protect the crew and passengers , '' according to the service .
As Morris , the Marine spokesman , pointed out , those who get on such aircraft or take part in other military exercises are n't always out of danger just because they 're off the battlefield .

ASPEN , Colorado — Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , suggested Saturday that Americans must be prepared for the possibility of a military confrontation with North Korea , whose nuclear program he deemed an urgent threat .
Although he stressed the importance of applying continued economic and diplomatic pressure aimed at persuading Pyongyang to give up its nuclear arms program , Dunford dismissed the oft-stated notion that a military option should n't be on the table .
`` Many people have talked about military options with words like 'unimaginable , ' '' Dunford said . `` I would probably shift that slightly and say it would be horrific , and it would be a loss of life unlike any we have experienced in our lifetimes , and I mean anyone who 's been alive since World War II has never seen the loss of life that could occur if there 's a conflict on the Korean Peninsula .
`` But as I 've told my counterparts , both friend and foe , '' he added , `` it is not unimaginable to have military options to respond to North Korean nuclear capability . What 's unimaginable to me is allowing a capability that would allow a nuclear weapon to land in Denver , Colorado . That 's unimaginable to me . So my job will be to develop military options to make sure that does n't happen . ''
Dunford was speaking at the Aspen Security Forum , a gathering of national security officials , experts and others that wrapped up Saturday . His comments came in the wake of North Korea 's testing of an inter-continental ballistic missile earlier this month .
At this stage , Pyongyang does not appear capable of delivering a nuclear weapon on such missiles , but its rapid advancement in the overall weapons systems is deeply worrying to President Donald Trump 's administration . Dunford stressed that the United States is already prepared to defend itself and allies such as South Korea and Japan against North Korea 's current capability of carrying out a more limited missile attack .
Dunford began chairing the Joint Chiefs of Staff in October 2015 , under then-President Barack Obama ; he is the nation 's highest-ranking military officer . Dunford has kept a relatively low profile since Trump took office six months ago , avoiding many of the ugly internal battles that have marked the Republican 's tenure . But he is involved in many of the key national security debates gripping the administration .
Among them is how to deal with Russia , which has taken adversarial positions against the United States in Syria and Ukraine and which U.S. intelligence agencies suspect interfered in the 2016 campaign .

Throughout Saturday 's discussion , which was moderated by Andrea Mitchell of NBC News , Dunford repeatedly mentioned his support for the work of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson , who has been tackling a range of crises , including corralling more international support to pressure North Korea and trying to repair a diplomatic rift between Qatar and a group of other countries led by Saudi Arabia .
The State Department has been targeted for serious financial cuts under a Trump budget proposal that is meeting stiff resistance in Congress . Dunford insisted that it 's important to properly resource America 's diplomats .

Mixed messages from DOD,2014-08-25,,"U.S. military officials gave varying – and at times confusing -- explanations Monday for what , if anything , would trigger U.S. airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Syria , after the Joint Chiefs chairman dialed back earlier comments that suggested support for such a strike .
On Sunday , Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey appeared to tone down remarks he made last week about the growing terror network that ’ s taken root in Iraq and Syria .
Dempsey , speaking to reporters on board a military plane traveling to Afghanistan , said he believes the Sunni insurgent group formerly known as ISIS is a regional threat , and he would not recommend airstrikes in Syria until they have become a direct threat to the U.S . He said the group is not currently plotting or planning attacks against the U.S. or Europe .
But Dempsey spokesman Col. Ed Thomas clarified to Fox News on Monday that Dempsey “ believes that ISIS is a regional threat that will soon become a threat to the United States and Europe . ”
Thomas said Dempsey is preparing options to “ address ” ISIS in both Iraq and Syria “ with a variety of military tools including airstrikes , ” and believes a coalition of partners is necessary to confront the threat .
But as for what could prompt U.S. airstrikes in Syria , a senior U.S. Defense spokesman told Fox News that the judgment on whether the Islamic State is a threat against the homeland is just one trigger .
`` Any threats against U.S. personnel and interests could drive action against ISIL in Syria , '' the official said .
The overall message appeared to be that the terror group could soon pose such a threat , and the military is preparing its options . Last week , though , Dempsey and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel spoke in dire terms about the threat posed by the Islamic State , with Dempsey saying the organization could not be defeated without some action in Syria .
The senior U.S. Defense spokesman said Monday that the message was the U.S. and its allies need a `` long-term strategy '' to separate ISIS from the population . `` In the meantime , if we see a plot against the homeland , of course we 'll attack it , '' the official said . ( White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest reiterated Monday afternoon that there is not an active plot right now by Islamic State militants in Syria to attack the U.S . )
Asked Monday on Fox News whether the White House had pushed back on military officials ' statements from last week , Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said no .
“ There has been no direction from the White House or anybody else to tone down the way we 're speaking about ISIL , and I think we 've all been very consistently talking about real and growing threat that ISIL poses , ” Kirby said .
ISIS has repeatedly made threats to attack the U.S. through social and conventional media . Earlier this month , in a Vice News documentary , a spokesman for the group vowed to `` raise the flag of Allah in the White House . '' The group took over Iraq 's second largest city , Mosul , in June , and has since declared an Islamic state , or caliphate , in a swath of territory covering northeastern Syria and northern and western Iraq . U.S. airstrikes and a new policy of direct military aid to Kurdish Peshmerga fighters have served as a check on a threatened ISIS advance toward Kurdish territory in northern Iraq .
On Sunday , though , Dempsey contrasted ISIS with the Yemen-based Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , which has plotted and attempted attacks against the U.S. and Europe . As a result , the U.S. has conducted counterterrorism strikes against the group within Yemen .
Dempsey said that so far , there is no sign that the Islamic State militants are engaged in `` active plotting against the homeland , so it 's different than that which we see in Yemen . ''
`` I can tell you with great clarity and certainty that if that threat existed inside of Syria that it would certainly be my strong recommendation that we would deal with it , '' said Dempsey . `` I have every confidence that the president of the United States would deal with it . ''
Dempsey also told reporters that he believes that key allies in the region -- including Jordan , Turkey and Saudi Arabia -- will join the U.S. in quashing the Islamic State group .
`` I think ISIS has been so brutal , and has wrapped itself in a radical religious legitimacy that clearly threatens everybody I just mentioned , that I think they will be willing partners , '' said Dempsey , who added that those regional partners could come together and squeeze the Islamic State group `` from multiple directions in order to initially disrupt and eventually defeat them . It has to happen with them , much less with us . ''
Up to now , when asked about airstrikes inside Syria , Dempsey and Hagel have said all options remain on the table . But so far there has been no broader authorization for such operations .
The Obama administration has authorized airstrikes within Iraq to protect U.S. personnel and facilities and to help Iraqi and Kurdish forces assist refugees driven from their homes by the Islamic State . Most of the recent strikes have been around the Mosul Dam , which Islamic militants had taken , but it is now back in the hands of the Iraqi and Kurdish troops .
Senior U.S. leaders , from the White House to the Pentagon , have said the key to success in Iraq is the formation of an inclusive government that will include disenfranchised Sunnis .
Officials have suggested that any additional military assistance from the U.S. to Iraq is contingent on those political and diplomatic steps by the government .
One possibility , said Dempsey , would be to have U.S. forces provide more expanded advice and assistance to the Iraqi force . He said military assessment teams looked at about 50 Iraqi brigades and a number of the Kurdish units and have a good idea which ones have appropriate training and equipment and have not been infiltrated by militia .
So far , Dempsey said the U.S. has not sought or received permission to put advisers into Iraqi brigades or headquarters units and accompany them into combat .
To date , U.S. forces have conducted a total of 96 airstrikes across Iraq . Of those , 62 have been around the Mosul Dam .","U.S. military officials gave varying – and at times confusing -- explanations Monday for what, if anything, would trigger U.S. airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Syria, after the Joint Chiefs chairman dialed back earlier comments that suggested support for such a strike.

""I can tell you with great clarity and certainty that if that threat existed inside of Syria that it would certainly be my strong recommendation that we would deal with it,"" said Dempsey. ""I have every confidence that the president of the United States would deal with it.""

Dempsey also told reporters that he believes that key allies in the region -- including Jordan, Turkey and Saudi Arabia -- will join the U.S. in quashing the Islamic State group.

""I think ISIS has been so brutal, and has wrapped itself in a radical religious legitimacy that clearly threatens everybody I just mentioned, that I think they will be willing partners,"" said Dempsey, who added that those regional partners could come together and squeeze the Islamic State group ""from multiple directions in order to initially disrupt and eventually defeat them. It has to happen with them, much less with us.""

Up to now, when asked about airstrikes inside Syria, Dempsey and Hagel have said all options remain on the table. But so far there has been no broader authorization for such operations.

The Obama administration has authorized airstrikes within Iraq to protect U.S. personnel and facilities and to help Iraqi and Kurdish forces assist refugees driven from their homes by the Islamic State. Most of the recent strikes have been around the Mosul Dam, which Islamic militants had taken, but it is now back in the hands of the Iraqi and Kurdish troops.

Senior U.S. leaders, from the White House to the Pentagon, have said the key to success in Iraq is the formation of an inclusive government that will include disenfranchised Sunnis.

Officials have suggested that any additional military assistance from the U.S. to Iraq is contingent on those political and diplomatic steps by the government.

One possibility, said Dempsey, would be to have U.S. forces provide more expanded advice and assistance to the Iraqi force. He said military assessment teams looked at about 50 Iraqi brigades and a number of the Kurdish units and have a good idea which ones have appropriate training and equipment and have not been infiltrated by militia.

So far, Dempsey said the U.S. has not sought or received permission to put advisers into Iraqi brigades or headquarters units and accompany them into combat.

To date, U.S. forces have conducted a total of 96 airstrikes across Iraq. Of those, 62 have been around the Mosul Dam.

With Congress expecting a draft Authorization of the Use of Military Force this week , President Barack Obama and other top national security officials are courting a broad bipartisan swath of lawmakers and Hill staffers to ensure that Congress and the White House can begin the politically perilous task at least partly in sync . The draft is likely to bear imprints from an extended back-and-forth between the White House and lawmakers , sources said , though that ’ s no guarantee that Capitol Hill will approve a new military conflict .
The debate over the new measure could last for weeks , possibly months , said lawmakers and administration officials .
The White House hopes to ensure that the Republicans who control Congress aren ’ t blindsided by Obama ’ s draft military force resolution , especially after lawmakers in both parties balked at both his 2013 request for approval to attack Syria and a Democratic-led 2014 authorization against ISIL . The White House legislative office , led by Katie Beirne Fallon , has been quietly holding meetings with GOP and Democratic lawmakers , chiefs of staff for key players and aides to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) and House Speaker John Boehner ( R-Ohio ) .
Also involved in the discussions for the Obama administration are Secretary of State John Kerry ; White House counsel Neil Eggleston ; Lisa Monaco , assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism ; National Security Adviser Susan Rice ; Assistant Deputy National Security Adviser Avril Haines ; and Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes , said a source familiar with the outreach .
Eggleston is expected to attend the Senate Democratic Caucus meeting Tuesday . Additional meetings with GOP senators are also being put together , said a source familiar with the White House ’ s outreach efforts .
White House officials say the text of the AUMF is still under review , and they will not finalize a draft proposal until they have consulted with as wide a group of lawmakers as possible . White House officials have told reporters that the AUMF is expected on the Hill by Wednesday , although that remains fluid depending on the state of consultations with lawmakers .
“ On the whole , the consultations have been productive and well-received , ” said the source , speaking on condition of anonymity . “ Even members who have expressed some disagreement with the administration ’ s approach have noted they appreciate the thoughtful and constructive way in which the White House has gone about seeking their input and engaging in a meaningful discussion on specific aspects of the language . ”
The source added : “ Furthermore , consultations are ongoing with additional Republicans and Democrats , and we have worked hard to accommodate various scheduling challenges of members , as well . The final text of the AUMF and timing for delivery will not be locked until we are able to complete these robust consultations and consider all of the feedback we have received . ”
Obama must thread the needle on a new war resolution : Democrats are antsy about anything that could lead to U.S. combat troops on the ground in Iraq and Syria , while hawkish Republicans are already pushing back against language that would restrict Obama from responding to an evolving conflict in a volatile yet critical region . How to write language that would allow ground troops in only specific circumstances , like personnel rescue , will be a major pivot point for an AUMF ’ s path to a House majority and 60 votes in the Senate .
The state of the Iran nuclear negotiations is another factor playing into the Islamic State debate . A number of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have been critical of how Obama and Kerry have handled the multilateral discussions over Iran ’ s nuclear program , and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’ s planned address to a joint session of Congress next month has caused a huge uproar . On the Islamic State , the White House and lawmakers want to find a consensus to demonstrate American resolve in the face of a growing threat to stability in the Middle East , as well as to U.S. allies like Jordan and Iraq .

Clearing Corker ’ s panel will be a major accomplishment for the White House given that senators in both parties balked at authorizing military strikes against Syria in 2013 and rejected the committee ’ s resolution from December 2014 , which never received a vote in the full Senate . That measure would have provided a three-year authorization of force that prohibited ground troops except for certain circumstances . It would also have sunsetted the 2001 authorization used to justify war in Afghanistan — along with the ongoing bombing campaign against ISIL that began in August .

“Friction between Mattis and the White House has led to less communication,” the lobbyist said. “The political people care about not embarrassing the president. The career people don’t. But there aren’t any political people around Mattis, and no one else has been confirmed for political positions in the Department.”

The implications go far beyond just a simple miscommunication, the lobbyist added.

“All of the Trump administration’s major national security policy positions are lost in this shuffle because there is no one there to implement them and communicate them to Congress,” the lobbyist said.

“Where is the new national security strategy and national military strategy? Where are the new policy proposals on increasing missile defense, improving readiness and increasing the size of the military to meet the threats we face around the globe? The day-to-day communication about ongoing programs continues with the program offices? It’s the big policy stuff that is getting lost.”

In the wake of the two public communication snafus, the Pentagon has vowed to improve its messaging moving forward.

“This is what transparency looks like. It's our responsibility to be as clear and open with the American people as possible,” Pentagon chief spokesperson Dana White said in a statement to The Hill.

“We could have been clearer, and we will strive to be so in the future.""

Daniels, meanwhile, said he predicts that bureaucrats will try to respond quickly to developments in order to pre-empt commentary from the White House or Trump himself via statements made on air or on Twitter.",www.thehill.com,center,WYj2FISC9FJhWisK

It is no exaggeration to say that a nuclear Iran represents an existential threat to Israel. And yet, while Hagel wants us to be softer on the Iranians, he thinks we should be tougher on the Israelis. In October 2000, at the beginning of the second Palestinian intifada, he was one of only four senators who refused to sign a letter to President Bill Clinton affirming U.S. solidarity with Israel. More recently, in January 2009, Hagel signed a letter advising Obama to spearhead direct, unconditional talks with Hamas, a terrorist group that had just fired hundreds of rockets into Israel.

Lest we forget, Hamas is an Iranian proxy whose senior leaders openly pray for genocidal violence against both Israelis and Americans. Last year, for example, a Hamas official named Ahmad Bahr, who serves as deputy speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, declared in a sermon, ""Oh Allah, destroy the Jews and their supporters. Oh Allah, destroy the Americans and their supporters. Oh Allah, count them one by one, and kill them all, without leaving a single one.""

Thus, by nominating Hagel for defense secretary, the president has sent the worst possible message to our closest Middle Eastern ally and our greatest Middle Eastern enemy.",www.cnn.com,left,jZQJhTiKPbzcArVf

Carter 's use of the personal account was first reported by The New York Times , which said that he had been confronted about his email habits by White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough this past May , three months after Carter took office as defense secretary .
Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook released a statement saying that Carter believes his use of personal email for work-related business was a mistake . Cook declined to say whether it was a violation of Pentagon email policies . Cook also said Carter stopped the practice , but Cook did not say when .
Carter also acknowledged the move was a mistake in an interview with CBS ' “ This Morning ” on Thursday . He said he occasionally used his iPhone to send messages to immediate staff , but stressed no classified information was involved .
The Times reported that Carter was assigned a government email account when he assumed his office in February , but continued to conduct most of his business on his private account , often sending messages via his iPhone or iPad . According to the paper , a former aide to Carter said that his boss used his personal account so often during that period that staffers feared he would be hacked .
Pentagon policy since 2012 has been to bar all employees from conducting government business on personal email . Last year , a law signed by President Obama barred federal officials from receiving or sending emails from personal accounts unless the messages were either copied or forwarded into government accounts within 20 days . It was not immediately clear whether Carter followed that directive .
The Times report comes in the midst of an FBI investigation into whether Hillary Clinton mishandled classified information by using a private account for all her emails while secretary of state . According to the Times , Carter continued to use his personal email at least two months after Clinton 's practices were revealed in March .
The Times said the emails it received under the Freedom of Information Act were exchanges between Carter and Eric Fanning , who was his chief of staff at the time and is now the acting secretary of the Army .
The emails were on a variety of work-related topics , the Times said , including speeches , meetings and news media appearances . In one such email , Carter discussed how he had mistakenly placed a note card in a `` burn bag , '' the Times reported . Such bags are typically used to destroy classified documents .
Cook said Carter `` does not use his personal email or official email for classified material . The Secretary has a secure communications team that handles his classified information and provides it to him as necessary . ''
Carter `` takes his responsibilities with regard to classified material very seriously , '' Cook said .","Defense Secretary Ash Carter used his personal email account to conduct some of his professional correspondence during his first months on the job earlier this year, the Pentagon admitted late Wednesday.

Carter's use of the personal account was first reported by The New York Times, which said that he had been confronted about his email habits by White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough this past May, three months after Carter took office as defense secretary.

Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook released a statement saying that Carter believes his use of personal email for work-related business was a mistake. Cook declined to say whether it was a violation of Pentagon email policies. Cook also said Carter stopped the practice, but Cook did not say when.

Carter also acknowledged the move was a mistake in an interview with CBS' “This Morning” on Thursday. He said he occasionally used his iPhone to send messages to immediate staff, but stressed no classified information was involved.

The Times reported that Carter was assigned a government email account when he assumed his office in February, but continued to conduct most of his business on his private account, often sending messages via his iPhone or iPad. According to the paper, a former aide to Carter said that his boss used his personal account so often during that period that staffers feared he would be hacked.

For women who have already seen combat , it is a decision that is well overdue . But for the skeptics , it is a setback that will damage the military .

Duckworth , an Illinois Democrat , said the military should open up every unit to women and see if they can complete the required training .
`` If the women ca n't meet the standards , they do n't get to graduate from the program . ''
U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard , a Hawaii Democrat who served with her state 's National Guard in Iraq , said the move is a `` major step that is long overdue . ''
Interviewed by CNN 's Soledad O'Brien , Gabbard said it 's a `` great recognition ... of all the women who are currently serving overseas , many of them in these combat type situations already . ''
Gabbard was asked whether the move is merely semantics because front lines are constantly shifting and disappearing in today 's world , and women already have been in combat situations .
`` I think so , '' Gabbard said . `` When we look at , for example , two women , the first two women who earned Silver Stars since World War II , one was a military police sergeant , another was a medic . And they both were operating on the front lines per se , under fire , under extreme duress , shoulder to shoulder with their male and female counterparts , and exhibiting great courage and heroism and saving the lives of their brothers and sisters .

Women supporting supply missions have been drawn into battle in Iraq and Afghanistan , where there are no physical front lines .

Weckerlein went to Iraq in May 2007 as part of then-President George W. Bush 's `` surge policy '' to put more troops on the ground .

Days later , Weckerlein came under mortar fire again . This time , her comrade -- a cameraman -- was injured .

Williams , who saw combat while with the 101st Airborne , said she thought some branches of the military would ask for exceptions to the policy , and that was hard to argue with .

The Defense Department plans to seek congressional approval to alter its spending to handle billions of dollars in unanticipated costs , including an additional $ 100 million a month to supply troops in Afghanistan .
The proposed changes , called an omnibus reprogramming request , will be submitted to Congress by the end of the week , said Pentagon spokeswoman Lt. Col. Elizabeth Robbins . “ It ’ s due by June 30 so we ’ ll get it in by then , ” she told ███ .
The request , which would require the approval of the chairmen and ranking members of the House and Senate Armed Services and Appropriations committees , could take a toll on weapons programs and other Pentagon initiatives .
“ They ’ re taking money from other programs to pay for the extra costs , ” said an industry source who requested anonymity because he was not authorized by his company to discuss the issue . “ Industry will have to suck it up somehow . ”
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta outlined the costs during a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing earlier this month .
“ We ’ ve got some unbudgeted needs that we would ask for your support , ” Panetta told lawmakers . “ Because of increases in fuel costs , we ’ re facing almost another $ 3 billion in additional costs with regards to that area . ”
Panetta noted that the military had sent additional Navy ships and land forces to the Middle East because of “ tensions in the Gulf , ” and that he had pledged to provide another $ 70 million to help Israel pay for its Iron Dome missile defense system .
Also , Pakistan ’ s refusal to allow NATO forces to ship supplies through the country has been a major driver of the unbudgeted costs . In November , Pakistan shut down a key supply route after a U.S. airstrike mistakenly killed 24 Pakistani soldiers .

“ We ’ re not announcing it ’ til next week , so don ’ t tell anyone , ” Mr. Trump told a cheering crowd in Cincinnati Thursday evening , referring to the nominee by his nickname , “ Mad Dog ” and calling him “ the closest thing we have to George Patton . ”
It is what many former military officials consider a “ good news , bad news ” story for the Pentagon , which , despite its implicit focus on waging war , has a long – and necessary , analysts are quick to add – tradition of civilian , rather than military , leadership .
“ The good news is that he ’ s incredibly competent and knows what wars mean , ” says retired Gen. David Barno , a three-star general who commanded US troops in Afghanistan from 2003 to 2005 . “ The bad news is that it narrows the field , in my view , of diverse opinions – maybe more than is advisable . ”
It is a concern that the Trump transition team has acknowledged , particularly given that Mattis would be the second retired general tapped to serve in the administration , and Trump is said to be eying a third .
He has named a former three-star general who clashed with the Obama administration , Michael Flynn , as his national security advisor . The president-elect is also said to be considering for secretary of State retired four-star Gen. David Petraeus , who formerly ran both the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the CIA – before being forced to resign after being convicted of mishandling classified documents .
“ It begins to look like Chile in the 1970s , ” one source advising the Trump team told U.S. News & World Report .
Those sorts of unpleasant optics – of a kind that imply military dictatorship , or at least heavy rule – were anticipated by Congress , which has a law in place restricting retired military officers from serving as secretary of Defense for a period of seven years after leaving active duty . Anything less requires a waiver from Congress .
Mattis , who retired in March 2013 , has been out for less than four years . There has been one exception made to this law in US history , when President Harry Truman appointed former Secretary of State and retired Gen. George Marshall to serve as secretary of Defense in 1950 .
“ Congress must not take any changes to this law lightly , even if they simply amount to carving out an exception for Gen. Mattis , ” the left-leaning Center for American Progress said in a statement . “ This law exists to preserve civilian control of the military , a cornerstone of American democracy . ”
It was a warning echoed this week by lawmakers as well . Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ( D ) of New York , a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee ( SASC ) , noted that while she “ deeply ” respects Mattis ’ s service , she will oppose a waiver . “ Civilian control is a fundamental principle of American democracy , and I will not vote for an exception to this rule , ” she said in a statement issued Thursday evening .
The SASC committee chairman , Sen. John McCain ( R ) of Arizona and a former Vietnam Navy fighter pilot and prisoner of war , was not as concerned . “ I look forward to moving forward with the confirmation process as soon as possible in the new Congress , ” he said in his statement calling Mattis “ without a doubt one of the finest military officers of his generation and an extraordinary leader who inspires a rare and special admiration of his troops . ”
Mattis ’ s salty Marine persona , complete with generous smatterings of profanity , is the stuff of Internet meme legend . “ Be polite , be professional , but have a plan to kill everybody you meet , ” is one of his tamer exhortations from his Iraq command days . On fighting the Taliban , including “ guys who slap women around for five years because they don ’ t wear a veil , ” he said : “ Guys like that ain ’ t got no manhood left anyway . So it ’ s a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them . ”
Being a successful military officer who rises to the rank of general , particularly in the infantry , often requires a decent flair for performance where the troops are concerned . In the film “ Patton , ” likely seen by a Trump who has favorably compared him to Mattis , the legendary World War II general fires up his soldiers before battle : “ We ’ re going to attack all night , we ’ re gon na attack tomorrow morning , ” he yells . “ If we are not victorious , let no man come back alive ! ”
When he finishes up his speech , one of his colonels implies that he might have been laying it on a bit thick . “ You know general , sometimes the men don ’ t know when you ’ re acting , ” he tells Patton .
“ It ’ s not important for them to know , ” Patton replies , with a wink and a nod . “ It ’ s only important for me to know . ”
Mattis , too , relieved an officer for not being aggressive enough in Iraq , but he is also considered “ one of the top two or three best-read generals the military has produced in his generation , ” Barno says .
Known for his devotion to the Marine Corps , Mattis has never married and is known as the “ warrior monk . ”
It is this sort of single-minded study of warfare that despite the impression of generals as shoot- ’ em-up enthusiasts of bloodshed –which they occasionally enjoy playing into – means that they are also intimately aware of the consequences of war .
In America ’ s current wars , most have spent a decade-and-a-half figuring out how to best spare civilian lives . There is the mercenary reason that angry civilians generally do not support the aims of the occupying force , but it is also widely believed in an era of modern warfare to be the right thing to do .
Still , Trump clearly treasures the generals for their perceived tough-guy swagger , an image the Queens-raised president-elect likes to cultivate himself . But many generals , too , have navigated a highly political military chain of command and make it to the top of their fields because they are savvy and self-aware – and , as Patton noted , know the difference between playing to the troops they must fire up for war and the sober responsibility for the lives of their soldiers once they actually get into battle .
Trump said that he was “ surprised , ” for instance , that tough-talking Mattis counseled him against the use of torture .
“ I said , ‘ What do you think of waterboarding ? ’ ” Trump told The New York Times . “ He [ Mattis ] said , ‘ I ’ ve never found it useful. ’ He said , ‘ I ’ ve always found , give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and I do better with that than I do with torture . ’ ”
This thorough and often unwelcome knowledge of what can happen to human nature when it meets with the prospect of death and power – and not the movie version of enemies – is why some of the toughest critics of military command are , in fact , the military members themselves .
“ It is somewhat concerning that Donald Trump continues to eye recently retired generals for some of the most important traditionally civilian positions in government , ” Jon Soltz , an Iraq War veteran and chairman of VoteVets.org , a veterans organization , said in a statement . “ While absolutely qualified , and loved by men and women who serve , we traditionally have had civilian leadership of the Pentagon for a good reason . ”
Trump appears to be less concerned with this tradition than he does with the opportunity for good marketing , Mr. Soltz adds . The military is the most respected institution in America , and Trump loves winners , as he likes to say . “ Trump is selling the brand of generals , ” Mr. Soltz says .
But the glorification of generals should also give Americans – less than 1 percent of whom have actually served in the military – pause , senior military officials have noted with increasing frequency in journal articles and roundtable discussions .
“ The founding fathers put democratically elected leaders in control of the military for a reason – so we don ’ t end up like a banana republic , ” Soltz says .
And although many service members will support Mattis if he receives a congressional waiver , as he is expected to , they remain wary of Trump as a commander-in-chief . In a September poll of military service members conducted by the Military Times and Syracuse University , 68 percent of respondents said they considered Trump ’ s temperament “ poor . ”
“ He has disrespected women , admitted to sexual assault , trashed the family of a dead trooper , and trashed Muslims generally , which undermines any moral authority we might have in the Middle East , ” Soltz says . “ There is a concern in the armed forces about this kind of toxic leadership . ”

The 'warrior monk'

Mattis’s salty Marine persona, complete with generous smatterings of profanity, is the stuff of Internet meme legend. “Be polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet,” is one of his tamer exhortations from his Iraq command days. On fighting the Taliban, including “guys who slap women around for five years because they don’t wear a veil,” he said: “Guys like that ain’t got no manhood left anyway.

Tough-guy swagger vs. real-world experience

Still, Trump clearly treasures the generals for their perceived tough-guy swagger, an image the Queens-raised president-elect likes to cultivate himself.

Importance of civilian rule

But the glorification of generals should also give Americans – less than 1 percent of whom have actually served in the military – pause, senior military officials have noted with increasing frequency in journal articles and roundtable discussions.

Controversial Hagel nomination passes on party line vote, proceeds to full Senate

Hagel has been criticized for a range of controversial foreign policy stances

Members of the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday narrowly approved the choice of Chuck Hagel to serve as President Barack Obama's next defense secretary, sending the controversial nomination to the full Senate.

Hagel's nomination cleared the committee in a straight party line 14 to 11 vote. No Republicans backed the former Nebraska GOP senator, a decorated Vietnam veteran who has come under fire on a range of issues relating to American foreign policy in the Middle East and elsewhere.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, declared that he could not ""in good conscience support this nomination because ... it is sending the worst possible signal to our friends and our enemies alike.""

Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, argued that Hagel has shown ""again and again that he is willing to sacrifice and that he has courage. ... I give him credit for that.""

The full Democratic-controlled Senate is expected to vote on the Hagel nomination this week. While some Republicans have suggested they might filibuster, CNN's Capitol Hill team has determined that Hagel has enough support to clear a 60-vote threshold if needed.

Sixty votes are needed to break a filibuster in the 100-member chamber.

Hagel has been fiercely criticized by his former GOP colleagues for allegedly shifting positions on confronting Iran, supporting Israel, and maintaining a strong military amid pressure to cut costs, among other things. The former senator was widely seen as stumbling badly in his lengthy January 31 confirmation hearing.

Hagel's ""performance before this committee was the worst that I have seen of any nominee for office,"" Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said shortly before Tuesday's vote.

In the days following his testimony, Republicans pushed Hagel to provide additional financial and other disclosures -- data Hagel insisted he did not have access to. Top Democrats called the requests, related to speeches Hagel made to numerous organizations, unprecedented and inappropriate.

Additionally, Graham threatened to place a hold on the nominations of both Hagel and CIA nominee John Brennan until the White House releases new information on last September's terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya.

Holds -- like filibusters -- can be broken with 60 votes.

President Obama , however , voiced support for General Allen through his spokesman on Tuesday . “ The president thinks very highly of General Allen , ” the spokesman , Jay Carney , said at a White House news briefing . “ He has faith in General Allen . ”
But the matter has created enough concern that General Allen ’ s recent nomination to become NATO ’ s top military officer was delayed at Mr. Panetta ’ s request , pending the investigation ’ s outcome .
Aides traveling with Mr. Panetta , reacting to anger from some of General Allen ’ s associates who said he was being unfairly treated , described Mr. Panetta as having great respect for General Allen . But they said that Mr. Panetta had little choice in referring the matter to the inspector general . General Dempsey informed General Allen of the investigation on Monday from Perth , where he had traveled for a security meeting that Mr. Panetta is also attending .
General Allen , a Marine , succeeded Mr. Petraeus as the top allied commander in Afghanistan in July 2011 . He also served as Mr. Petraeus ’ s deputy when both officers led the military ’ s Central Command , based in Tampa , from 2008 until 2010 .
General Allen ’ s connection to the scandal appears to have originated with an e-mail he received from an account that was registered under a fake name and has now been linked to Ms. Broadwell , according to a senior American official . The e-mail warned General Allen to be wary of Ms. Kelley and was vaguely threatening . Though he did not know who had written the e-mail , he was concerned and passed it on to Ms. Kelley . She then discussed it with an agent she knew at the F.B.I. ’ s field office in Tampa , whose cybercrime unit opened an investigation that eventually linked Ms. Broadwell to General Petraeus .
A senior law enforcement official in Washington said Tuesday that F.B.I . investigators , looking into Ms. Kelley ’ s complaint about anonymous e-mails she had received , examined all of her e-mails as a routine step . Officials familiar with the investigation said it covers 20,000 to 30,000 page of documents , but Pentagon officials cautioned against making too much of that number , since some might be from e-mail chains , or brief messages printed out on a whole page .
On Monday night , F.B.I . agents searched Ms. Broadwell ’ s home in Charlotte , N.C. , and local television news crews filmed them carrying away boxes of material in what officials said was part of that continuing investigation .
The defense official said that the e-mails between Ms. Kelley and General Allen spanned the years 2010 to 2012 .
American officials familiar with the social dynamics at the upper echelons of the Central Command described Ms. Kelley as wealthy socialite who knew “ almost every ” high-ranking officer serving in Tampa . Her ties were close enough that Mr. Petraeus and General Allen both intervened last September in a messy custody dispute on behalf of Ms. Kelley ’ s twin sister , Natalie Khawam .
A senior official said Ms. Kelley was close to both General Allen and his wife . She would often send e-mails , hundreds over the course of any given year , to the couple about parties or people she had met or trips she was considering . General Allen was never alone with Ms. Kelley , the official said , and while he may have been “ affectionate in a few e-mails with her , there ’ s nothing he ’ s embarrassed about or embarrassed to tell his wife about . ”","Senior officials in the Obama administration and lawmakers from both parties expressed shock at what could be a widening scandal into two of the most prominent generals of their generation: Mr. Petraeus, who was the top commander in Iraq and Afghanistan before he retired from the military to become director of the C.I.A. , only to resign on Friday because of his affair, and General Allen, who also served in Iraq and now commands 68,000 American troops in Afghanistan.

President Obama , however, voiced support for General Allen through his spokesman on Tuesday. “The president thinks very highly of General Allen,” the spokesman, Jay Carney , said at a White House news briefing. “He has faith in General Allen.”

But the matter has created enough concern that General Allen’s recent nomination to become NATO’s top military officer was delayed at Mr. Panetta’s request, pending the investigation’s outcome.

Aides traveling with Mr. Panetta, reacting to anger from some of General Allen’s associates who said he was being unfairly treated, described Mr. Panetta as having great respect for General Allen. But they said that Mr. Panetta had little choice in referring the matter to the inspector general. General Dempsey informed General Allen of the investigation on Monday from Perth , where he had traveled for a security meeting that Mr. Panetta is also attending.

General Allen, a Marine, succeeded Mr. Petraeus as the top allied commander in Afghanistan in July 2011. He also served as Mr. Petraeus’s deputy when both officers led the military’s Central Command, based in Tampa, from 2008 until 2010.

General Allen’s connection to the scandal appears to have originated with an e-mail he received from an account that was registered under a fake name and has now been linked to Ms. Broadwell, according to a senior American official. The e-mail warned General Allen to be wary of Ms. Kelley and was vaguely threatening. Though he did not know who had written the e-mail, he was concerned and passed it on to Ms. Kelley. She then discussed it with an agent she knew at the F.B.I.’s field office in Tampa, whose cybercrime unit opened an investigation that eventually linked Ms. Broadwell to General Petraeus.

A senior law enforcement official in Washington said Tuesday that F.B.I. investigators, looking into Ms. Kelley’s complaint about anonymous e-mails she had received, examined all of her e-mails as a routine step. Officials familiar with the investigation said it covers 20,000 to 30,000 page of documents, but Pentagon officials cautioned against making too much of that number, since some might be from e-mail chains, or brief messages printed out on a whole page.

On Monday night, F.B.I. agents searched Ms. Broadwell’s home in Charlotte , N.C., and local television news crews filmed them carrying away boxes of material in what officials said was part of that continuing investigation.

The defense official said that the e-mails between Ms. Kelley and General Allen spanned the years 2010 to 2012.

American officials familiar with the social dynamics at the upper echelons of the Central Command described Ms. Kelley as wealthy socialite who knew “almost every” high-ranking officer serving in Tampa. Her ties were close enough that Mr. Petraeus and General Allen both intervened last September in a messy custody dispute on behalf of Ms. Kelley’s twin sister, Natalie Khawam.

A senior official said Ms. Kelley was close to both General Allen and his wife.

U.S. officials have consistently claimed that offering too many details about the covert drone program could threaten national security.

Since the bulk of Brennan's hearing will be behind closed doors, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has no reason to shy away from asking tough questions about the drone program.

It's true that a drone is precise, meaning it will hit what it is aimed at -- a building, a bunker or a person. But there are valid concerns about whether the target hit is the right one.

Opinion: When are drone killings illegal?

Remote drones likely rely on sources that may be questionable such as video and cell phone intercepts to identify a target. Civilians may be mistakenly targeted as combatants and counted as such because there are no ground troops to conduct a battle damage assessment, interview witnesses or properly identify bodies.

Civilians may also get caught up in so-called ""signature strikes"" in which operators target individuals based on behavior, not on known identity. This is legally questionable but also has real ramifications for civilians living under drones.

If a civilian in Pakistan doesn't know what behavior makes him a target for U.S. drones, he cannot fully protect himself and his family. If a drone harms his family, even mistakenly, our research shows they won't receive an apology, explanation or any help from the United States. Certainly there will be no love lost for America.

The drone program needs to come out of the shadows, with explanations about who is a civilian, who is a target, and how drone operators distinguish between the two.

The CIA should get out of the drone operation business, handing it over to the Defense Department, which has a culture of learning lessons, accountability to Congress and a new openness about civilian protection after 10 years of war in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Drone operators should be trained in civilian protection best practices, and any civilian harmed should receive recognition and help for their losses, in accordance with the values American policymakers have espoused about humanity even during times of war.

The Senate may confirm Brennan as head of the CIA. It should also confirm where he stands on government accountability for lethal force and the CIA's role in the remote drone program.

Obama appointed Hagel , a former Republican senator , as Defense Secretary in early 2013 . He was expected to serve all four years of Obama 's second term , so this is an early retirement . Hagel has had a rough two years at the Pentagon , but this is also , to some degree , about the Obama administration trying to fix its increasingly broken foreign policy . READ : Why Obama should blame himself , not Chuck Hagel , for Hagel 's failure as Defense Secretary
Hagel had two kinds of failures as Secretary of Defense .
The first kind are policy failures , and they 're not insignificant . In Afghanistan , Hagel failed to gain enough ground against the Taliban to force them to accept some kind of peace deal ; instead , the Taliban sees itself as winning outright and is largely ignoring American negotiators . In Egypt , Hagel took the lead in trying to convince defense minister Abdel Fatah el-Sisi not to depose Egypt 's first-ever democratically elected president in a coup ; Hagel failed and the coup went ahead . In Iraq and Syria , Hagel failed to devise a strategy that would prevent the rise of ISIS or that would roll it back . In Ukraine , Hagel has not contributed to the effort to roll back or deter Russia 's still-ongoing invasion . In Hagel 's defense , he is not the lead on Russia and the Afghanistan policy was failing before he took office , but ISIS and Egypt are definitely under his purview .
The second set of failures , though , are bureaucratic , and that 's more important than you might think . In some ways , Hagel 's biggest job is to be the Pentagon 's representative to the White House and to Congress , as well as to bring White House-set policy to the Pentagon . Hagel did n't really succeed at either . He was viewed skeptically in the Pentagon as an ineffective representative and manager who failed to advocate on behalf of the vast institution that is the US military .

Obama appointed Hagel, a former Republican senator, as Defense Secretary in early 2013. He was expected to serve all four years of Obama's second term, so this is an early retirement. Hagel has had a rough two years at the Pentagon, but this is also, to some degree, about the Obama administration trying to fix its increasingly broken foreign policy. READ: Why Obama should blame himself, not Chuck Hagel, for Hagel's failure as Defense Secretary

Why Hagel is leaving his job

Hagel had two kinds of failures as Secretary of Defense.

The first kind are policy failures, and they're not insignificant. In Afghanistan, Hagel failed to gain enough ground against the Taliban to force them to accept some kind of peace deal; instead, the Taliban sees itself as winning outright and is largely ignoring American negotiators. In Egypt, Hagel took the lead in trying to convince defense minister Abdel Fatah el-Sisi not to depose Egypt's first-ever democratically elected president in a coup; Hagel failed and the coup went ahead. In Iraq and Syria, Hagel failed to devise a strategy that would prevent the rise of ISIS or that would roll it back. In Ukraine, Hagel has not contributed to the effort to roll back or deter Russia's still-ongoing invasion. In Hagel's defense, he is not the lead on Russia and the Afghanistan policy was failing before he took office, but ISIS and Egypt are definitely under his purview.

The second set of failures, though, are bureaucratic, and that's more important than you might think. In some ways, Hagel's biggest job is to be the Pentagon's representative to the White House and to Congress, as well as to bring White House-set policy to the Pentagon. Hagel didn't really succeed at either. He was viewed skeptically in the Pentagon as an ineffective representative and manager who failed to advocate on behalf of the vast institution that is the US military. Within the White House discussions that set American foreign policy, he was lax and ineffective, known as not good at steering debate or contributing. The New York Times writes, damningly, ""Hagel has often had problems articulating his thoughts — or administration policy — in an effective manner.""

There's a much deeper issue: Obama's team is adrift on foreign policy

That policy has largely failed (look at the struggling efforts with ISIS and Russia's Ukraine invasion), and now Obama appears to be pinning the failure on Hagel — which is not going to fix the problem, given that Obama had already neutered Hagel's ability to set and shape foreign policy.

TEL AVIV — Syria retains chemical weapons and has dispersed its warplanes in recent days, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said at a news conference Friday.

The aircraft dispersal suggests possible concerns about further U.S. missile strikes after President Trump ordered strikes on a Syrian air base following a chemical weapons attack in a rebel-held town in Idlib province on April 4 that killed 89 people.

Scientists from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons found ""incontrovertible"" evidence that the victims were exposed to Sarin or a Sarin-like substance after samples from 10 victims were analyzed.

Mattis would not say how much chemical weaponry Syria has. “The amount of it I don’t want to get into it right now,” he said. “We don’t reveal some of that detail because we don’t want to reveal how we’re finding out. But the bottom line is that I can say authoritatively that they have retained some.”

He said having the weapons is a violation of a United Nations Security Council resolution, and Syria would be “well advised” not to use chemical weapons again.

Mattis spoke alongside Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who declined to comment on news reports that Israel believes Syria holds up to three tons of chemical weapons.

In Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel welcomed the new Trump administration.

""This is a welcome change, a strategic change of American leadership and policy,"" Netanyahu said in a brief appearance with Mattis.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes sarin as a human-made chemical warfare agent classified as a nerve agent. Generally odorless and tasteless, it can cause death in minutes.

The decision deals the biggest legal blow to the Selective Service System since the Supreme Court upheld the draft registration process in 1981 . In Rostker v. Goldberg , the court ruled that a male-only draft was `` fully justified '' because women were ineligible for combat roles .
But U.S. District Judge Gray Miller ruled late Friday that while historical restrictions on women serving in combat `` may have justified past discrimination , '' men and women are now equally able to fight . In 2015 , the Pentagon lifted all restrictions for women in military service .
More : Q & A : A judge has ruled the male-only military draft unconstitutional . What happens now ?
The case was brought by the National Coalition For Men , a men 's rights group , and two men who argued an all-male draft was unfair .

A federal judge in Texas has declared that an all-male military draft is unconstitutional, ruling that ""the time has passed"" for a debate on whether women belong in the military.

The decision deals the biggest legal blow to the Selective Service System since the Supreme Court upheld the draft registration process in 1981. In Rostker v. Goldberg, the court ruled that a male-only draft was ""fully justified"" because women were ineligible for combat roles.

But U.S. District Judge Gray Miller ruled late Friday that while historical restrictions on women serving in combat ""may have justified past discrimination,"" men and women are now equally able to fight. In 2015, the Pentagon lifted all restrictions for women in military service.

More:Q&A: A judge has ruled the male-only military draft unconstitutional. What happens now?

The case was brought by the National Coalition For Men, a men's rights group, and two men who argued an all-male draft was unfair.

Men who fail to register with the Selective Service System at their 18th birthday can be denied public benefits such as federal employment and student loans. Women cannot register for Selective Service.

The ruling comes as an 11-member commission is studying the future of the Selective Service System, including whether women should be included or whether there should continue to be draft registration at all. The U.S. has maintained an all-volunteer military after the draft was discontinued in 1973, but the Selective Service System was reactivated in 1980 as a contingency in case military conscription becomes necessary again.

The National Commission on Military, National and Public Service released an interim report last month giving no hints on where it would come down on those questions. But, commission chairman Joe Heck told USA TODAY, ""I don’t think we will remain with the status quo.""

More:Should women be required to register for the draft? Commission likely to recommend big changes

The government had argued that the court should delay its ruling until that commission makes its recommendations. But Miller said Congress has been debating the issue since 1980, and the commission's final report won't come until next year. And because the commission is advisory, there's no guarantee Congress will act, he said.

Miller said Congress has never fully examined whether men are physically better able to serve than women. In fact, he noted in a footnote, ""the average woman could conceivably be better suited physically for some of today's combat positions than the average man, depending on which skills the position required. Combat roles no longer uniformly require sheer size or muscle.""

Quoting the Supreme Court's ruling overturning bans on same-sex marriage, Miller ruled that restrictions based on gender ""must substantially serve an important governmental interest today.""

The judge denied the government's request for a stay of the ruling. Justice Department officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

But the ruling came in the form of a declaratory judgment and not an injunction, meaning the court didn't specifically order the government how to change Selective Service to make it constitutional.

""Yes, to some extent this is symbolic, but it does have some real-world impact,"" said Marc Angelucci, the lawyer for the men challenging the Selective Service System.

GOP senators said they are delaying the confirmation in order to have more time to study Mr. Hagel ’ s record and to obtain more information on the White House ’ s handling of the September attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi , Libya , a matter on which they accuse the administration of stonewalling or providing wrong information . Republicans expect they will green-light him later this month after the chamber returns from a weeklong vacation .
Still , the filibuster is a stark move against a man who just four years ago was a Republican senator from Nebraska — meaning the senators are blocking one of their former colleagues .
The vote drew a furious response from the White House , which said Republicans were “ playing politics ” with the Defense Department and with Mr. Hagel , who was wounded serving as an enlisted combat soldier in Vietnam .
“ Allow this war hero an up-or-down vote , and let our troops have the secretary of defense they deserve , ” press secretary Jay Carney said after the vote .
Some Republicans said they were withholding support to try to pry loose information from the White House , while others said they want more responses from Mr. Hagel . They also questioned why Democrats were moving so quickly on a nominee approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee on a party-line vote two days earlier .

“ The debate time for Sen. Hagel is not yet over , ” said Sen. Lindsey Graham , South Carolina Republican , who was one of those taking the lead in demanding information from the White House on Benghazi — in particular , details about Mr. Obama ’ s actions during the seven-hour siege on the consulate , during which U.S . Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed .
In a letter sent Thursday , White House Counsel Kathryn H. Ruemmler signaled that Mr. Obama didn ’ t make any phone calls the night of the attack — though she said Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton , on behalf of Mr. Obama , called the Libyan president .
Mr. Graham said that if Mr. Obama had picked up the phone , at least two of the four Americans killed might still be alive because he might have been able to push U.S. aid to get to the scene faster .
“ During the entire attack , the president of the United States never picked up the phone to put the weight of his office in the mix , ” he said .
In the Hagel vote , four Republicans joined Democrats in trying to break the filibuster . But the effort fell one vote shy .
“ Just when we thought things couldn ’ t get worse , it gets worse , ” said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , Nevada Democrat .
He said the Senate now faces new heights of obstruction .
On Thursday morning , Mr. Reid warned that Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta would leave the post at noon , meaning the country would be without a defense secretary .
“ In less than two hours , our country will be without a secretary of defense at a time when we have a war going on in Afghanistan . There are about 70,000 troops there . We have a nuclear weapon that was detonated in North Korea a few days ago , ” Mr. Reid said .
But the White House undercut that . A spokesman told reporters traveling with the president aboard Air Force One that Mr. Panetta would remain in office until a successor is confirmed . Still , the spokesman said Mr. Obama would like to have Mr. Hagel in office in time to attend a meeting of NATO defense ministers next week .
Mr. Hagel , 66 , earned two Purple Hearts during his service in Vietnam . He also served two terms as senator , during which he was often a thorn in his own party ’ s side .
When Mr. Obama nominated Mr. Hagel , the president said he would be an independent voice at the Pentagon .
Defense secretaries are usually confirmed without trouble — and often by voice vote .
The one notable exception was John Tower , another former senator rejected by his colleagues in 1989 . But rather than being filibustered by a minority , Mr. Tower was defeated outright on a 53-47 vote .
In Mr. Hagel ’ s case , some of his past statements and votes with respect to Israel and Iran have troubled Republicans .
Still , other Republicans said they are using Mr. Hagel ’ s nomination to try to pry more information from the White House on the events surrounding Benghazi . Mr. Graham and others say the administration has yet to answer a number of questions about the attack , the U.S. response and its aftermath .
Republicans said Democrats could have postponed the vote but pushed ahead in order to create a political issue .
“ It ’ s an unfortunate vote , and it ’ s unfortunate to characterize this as a filibuster . This is a vote by Republicans to say we want more than two days , ” said Sen. Lamar Alexander , Tennessee Republican .
Mr. Alexander talked about his own experience when he was nominated to be secretary of education , another Cabinet position , and a single senator blocked him for weeks .

defense,Washington Post,0,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/dec/20/james-mattis-retiring-trumps-defense-secretary-feb/,Mattis resigns after clash with Trump over troop withdrawal from Syria and Afghanistan,2018-12-20,"Carlo Muñoz, Ben Wolfgang","Defense Secretary James Mattis , the last of a team President Trump dubbed “ my generals , ” will step down early next year amid deepening rifts with the White House on crucial foreign policy matters , marking the departure of an original Trump Cabinet member and creating a leadership void at the Pentagon at a critical time for the president at home and abroad .
After meeting with Mr. Trump earlier in the day , Mr. Mattis said in a resignation letter Thursday evening that his views are no longer aligned with those of the commander in chief . He took thinly veiled shots at the president over America ’ s “ common defense , ” the best way to confront rivals such as China and Russia , and the guiding principle of “ treating allies with respect . ”
Notably , the Mattis letter said it was a privilege to “ serve the nation and our men and women in uniform ” — without mentioning the president .
His coming exit , first announced by Mr. Trump on Twitter , sent shock waves through Washington and governments around the world just a day after the president made the stunning declaration that the U.S. had defeated the Islamic State in Syria and that all American troops would soon leave the country .
Mr. Mattis strongly disagreed with the decision and argued to Mr. Trump that withdrawing could leave allies who fought alongside U.S. forces in the lurch . The secretary reportedly tried to persuade Mr. Trump to change his mind on Syria during their White House meeting but was unsuccessful .
The defense secretary ’ s frustration may have been compounded by reports that Mr. Trump was contemplating a second partial troop withdrawal opposed by many of his senior security advisers in Afghanistan . Together with Syria , such a withdrawal would mark a fundamental shift in American foreign policy in the Middle East .
“ Just read Gen. Mattis ‘ letter , ” Sen. Marco Rubio , Florida Republican , tweeted shortly after the news broke . “ It makes it abundantly clear that we are headed toward a series of grave policy errors which will endanger our nation , damage our alliances and empower our adversaries . ”
“ Everything that indicates strength , everything that indicates knowledge , is leaving this administration , ” said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer , New York Democrat . He said recent departures , including former Gen. John F. Kelly ’ s decision to step down as White House chief of staff , are signs of “ chaos ” under Mr. Trump .
In his two-page letter , Mr. Mattis spoke of the need for America to stand up strongly to “ authoritarian ” regimes such as Russia and China . But his central disagreement appeared to focus on the decision to pull out of Syria and what it means for the U.S. relationship with key allies .
“ One core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships , ” Mr. Mattis wrote . “ While the U.S. remains the indispensable nation in the free world , we can not protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies .
“ My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues , ” he continued . “ Because you have the right to have a secretary of defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects , I believe it is right for me to step down from my position . ”
The president ’ s decision to withdraw from Syria has sparked bipartisan outrage . Publicly , Mr. Mattis stayed mum on the subject , but he and other Pentagon officials in recent weeks have stressed that the Islamic State is far from defeated — something Mr. Trump directly contradicted in his withdrawal order .
Mr. Trump praised Mr. Mattis on Twitter , saying he made great strides in rebuilding the military for 21st-century conflicts . His tweet suggested only that Mr. Mattis decided it was time to retire .
“ During Jim ’ s tenure , tremendous progress has been made , especially with respect to the purchase of new fighting equipment , ” Mr. Trump said . “ General Mattis was a great help to me in getting allies and other countries to pay their share of military obligations . A new Secretary of Defense will be named shortly . I greatly thank Jim for his service ! ”
Mr. Trump earlier this month announced that Gen. Mark A. Milley , Army chief of staff , will succeed Gen. Joseph F. Dunford as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff next fall .
White House officials Thursday night tried to downplay the divide between Mr. Trump and Mr. Mattis and took issue with the narrative that the secretary was resigning in protest over Syria .
“ It ’ s very normal at this point in the administration to have turnover , ” White House adviser Stephen Miller told CNN .
Across Washington , reaction to Mr. Mattis ‘ departure was a mix of respect for decades of military service and fear that a respected figure widely seen as a somber voice of reason in a chaotic administration was leaving .
Mr. Rubio said filling Mr. Mattis ‘ shoes at the Pentagon will be no easy task . He said he hoped the secretary did not resign only because of fundamental disagreements over Syria , though Mr. Mattis was reportedly “ livid ” heading into his meeting with Mr. Trump .
“ For the sake of our national security , I hope his decision to resign was motivated solely by a desire to enjoy a well-deserved retirement , ” Mr. Rubio said .
Sen. Mark R. Warner , Virginia Democrat , characterized Mr. Mattis ‘ retirement as scary . He tweeted that Mr. Mattis “ has been an island of stability amidst the chaos of the Trump administration . ”
“ As we ’ ve seen with the president ’ s haphazard approach to Syria , our national defense is too important to be subjected to the president ’ s erratic whims , ” he added .
Other lawmakers agreed and openly worried that Mr. Mattis was essentially being pushed out of an administration that wrongly believes the fight against Islamic State terrorists is over .
“ This is a sad day for America because Secretary Mattis was giving advice the president needs to hear , ” said Sen. Ben Sasse , Nebraska Republican . “ Mattis rightly believes that Russia and China are clear adversaries and that we are at war with jihadists across the globe who plot to kill Americans at home … and no , ISIS is not gone . ”
Mr. Trump will be searching for a new defense chief while he installs a new White House chief of staff , shepherds a new attorney general nominee through Senate confirmation , deals with a Democratic House coming to power , bargains over a looming government shutdown Friday , and deals with special counsel Robert Mueller ’ s widening investigation into claims that his presidential campaign colluded with Russia .
Democratic leaders pounced on the news of Mr. Mattis ‘ resignation as further proof that the wheels are coming off Mr. Trump ’ s presidency .
“ As this administration continues to implode , Secretary Mattis ‘ extraordinary resignation is a significant loss and a real indication that President Trump ’ s foreign policy agenda has failed and continues to spiral into chaos , ” Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey , the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , said in a statement . “ Clearly , Secretary Mattis ‘ resignation was prompted by the president ’ s flawed and hasty decision to withdraw our troops from Syria . ”
Speculation over Mr. Mattis ‘ dimming future in the administration heightened after the announced departure of Mr. Kelly , a fellow former Marine Corps general , as chief of staff this month . The end of Mr. Mattis ‘ tenure in the Trump administration marks the last former general officer to leave a White House post .
Retired Gen. Michael Flynn quit after only a month as White House national security adviser after he admitted misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his contacts with Russian officials . Flynn is awaiting sentencing for lying to the FBI in Mr. Mueller ’ s Russia investigation .
Army Gen. H.R . McMaster succeeded Flynn as national security adviser , but he clashed with Mr. Trump and lasted less than a year in the post .
Mr. Kelly began in the administration as homeland security secretary and was tapped in July 2017 as White House chief of staff to bring more discipline to the West Wing . Mr. Trump announced that Mr. Kelly will leave his post at the end of this year .
While Mr. Trump and Mr. Kelly were known to engage in heated arguments inside the West Wing , the relationship between the president and Mr. Mattis was more nuanced . The two men were always publicly respectful of each other .
But behind the scenes , the deep policy disagreements had been piling up . Mr. Mattis recently went to the mat with the White House over a planned Defense Department budget cut , privately telling the president that he could not execute the administration ’ s national security strategy with a spending level of $ 700 billion . Mr. Trump eventually reversed course and raised the figure to $ 750 billion .
Mr. Mattis also opposed the president ’ s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord in the summer of 2017 . He also spoke out against the concept of a U.S. Space Force , though he ultimately got on board with the idea after Mr. Trump insisted on it .
Mr. Mattis was privately critical of the president ’ s decision to send U.S. troops to the Mexican border , and he opposed Mr. Trump ’ s suggestion that members of the armed forces could be drafted to construct a wall .
The defense secretary was largely left in the dark when Mr. Trump announced over the summer that the U.S. would suspend key joint military drills with South Korea amid the president ’ s unprecedented diplomatic outreach to North Korea . Mr. Mattis also expressed serious reservations about the White House ’ s decision to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem .
Perhaps most important , Mr. Trump ’ s determination to challenge the foreign policy establishment on the wisdom of overseas U.S. military missions and alliances led to repeated clashes between the White House and the Pentagon . The Syria decision — and the possible drawdown in Afghanistan — deeply unsettled Mr. Mattis .
Mr. Trump also clearly chafed at the respect and praise Mr. Mattis received in Congress and abroad . The Pentagon chief was often portrayed in the press as the last line of defense against Mr. Trump ’ s worst foreign policy impulses . The billionaire real estate developer and the scholarly , professional soldier also failed to click on less-momentous issues . Mr. Trump reportedly was frustrated at the Pentagon ’ s slow-walking of his order banning transgender troops from the military and of his desire for an expensive military parade on the streets of Washington .
The relationship clearly reached a tipping point in October when Mr. Trump called Mr. Mattis “ a Democrat ” during a “ 60 Minutes ” interview .
I have a very good relationship with him . … I think he ’ s sort of a Democrat , if you want to know the truth , ” Mr. Trump said . “ But Gen. Mattis is a good guy . We get along very well . He may leave . I mean , at some point , everybody leaves . Everybody . People leave . That ’ s Washington . ”
Mr. Mattis responded by saying he had never been affiliated with any political party .
The unexpected timing of the resignation left Mr. Trump with no clear favorite as a replacement . One long-rumored candidate is Sen. Tom Cotton , a hawkish Arkansas Republican who received the Bronze Star while serving in the Army in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Before ascending to the defense secretary post , Mr. Mattis ‘ nickname in the media was “ Mad Dog Mattis ” — a moniker that reporters often used to describe the respect he had from rank-and-file soldiers in the field .
But it may also have been tied to Mr. Mattis ‘ notoriously bare-knuckle demeanor as a combat general in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars , where he offered sharp-tongued quotes to the press .
He was quoted as saying that a good soldier “ follows orders , but a true warrior wears his enemy ’ s skin like a poncho , ” and to live by the motto : “ Be polite , be professional , but have a plan to kill everybody you meet . ”
The retired Marine general said during his defense secretary confirmation hearing in January 2017 that the “ nickname was given to me by the press . ”
“ Perhaps they didn ’ t get it quite right , ” he added , suggesting he wasn ’ t entirely comfortable with the moniker .
Some reports have noted that the nickname is never used by Mr. Mattis ‘ close friends , who regard him as a kind and studious man , who is so well-read in military history that he has a penchant for saying memorable things of his own .","Defense Secretary James Mattis, the last of a team President Trump dubbed “my generals,” will step down early next year amid deepening rifts with the White House on crucial foreign policy matters, marking the departure of an original Trump Cabinet member and creating a leadership void at the Pentagon at a critical time for the president at home and abroad.

Respected voice

Across Washington, reaction to Mr. Mattis‘ departure was a mix of respect for decades of military service and fear that a respected figure widely seen as a somber voice of reason in a chaotic administration was leaving.

Mr. Rubio said filling Mr. Mattis‘ shoes at the Pentagon will be no easy task. He said he hoped the secretary did not resign only because of fundamental disagreements over Syria, though Mr. Mattis was reportedly “livid” heading into his meeting with Mr. Trump.

The end of Mr. Mattis‘ tenure in the Trump administration marks the last former general officer to leave a White House post.

Retired Gen. Michael Flynn quit after only a month as White House national security adviser after he admitted misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his contacts with Russian officials. Flynn is awaiting sentencing for lying to the FBI in Mr. Mueller’s Russia investigation.

Army Gen. H.R. McMaster succeeded Flynn as national security adviser, but he clashed with Mr. Trump and lasted less than a year in the post.

Mr. Kelly began in the administration as homeland security secretary and was tapped in July 2017 as White House chief of staff to bring more discipline to the West Wing. Mr. Trump announced that Mr. Kelly will leave his post at the end of this year.

A deteriorating relationship

While Mr. Trump and Mr. Kelly were known to engage in heated arguments inside the West Wing, the relationship between the president and Mr. Mattis was more nuanced. The two men were always publicly respectful of each other.

But behind the scenes, the deep policy disagreements had been piling up. Mr. Mattis recently went to the mat with the White House over a planned Defense Department budget cut, privately telling the president that he could not execute the administration’s national security strategy with a spending level of $700 billion. Mr. Trump eventually reversed course and raised the figure to $750 billion.

Mr. Mattis also opposed the president’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord in the summer of 2017. He also spoke out against the concept of a U.S. Space Force, though he ultimately got on board with the idea after Mr. Trump insisted on it.

Mr. Mattis was privately critical of the president’s decision to send U.S. troops to the Mexican border, and he opposed Mr. Trump’s suggestion that members of the armed forces could be drafted to construct a wall.

The defense secretary was largely left in the dark when Mr. Trump announced over the summer that the U.S. would suspend key joint military drills with South Korea amid the president’s unprecedented diplomatic outreach to North Korea. Mr. Mattis also expressed serious reservations about the White House’s decision to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

Perhaps most important, Mr. Trump’s determination to challenge the foreign policy establishment on the wisdom of overseas U.S. military missions and alliances led to repeated clashes between the White House and the Pentagon. The Syria decision — and the possible drawdown in Afghanistan — deeply unsettled Mr. Mattis.

Mr. Trump also clearly chafed at the respect and praise Mr. Mattis received in Congress and abroad. The Pentagon chief was often portrayed in the press as the last line of defense against Mr. Trump’s worst foreign policy impulses. The billionaire real estate developer and the scholarly, professional soldier also failed to click on less-momentous issues. Mr. Trump reportedly was frustrated at the Pentagon’s slow-walking of his order banning transgender troops from the military and of his desire for an expensive military parade on the streets of Washington.

The relationship clearly reached a tipping point in October when Mr. Trump called Mr. Mattis “a Democrat” during a “60 Minutes” interview.

I have a very good relationship with him. … I think he’s sort of a Democrat, if you want to know the truth,” Mr. Trump said. “But Gen. Mattis is a good guy. We get along very well. He may leave. I mean, at some point, everybody leaves. Everybody. People leave. That’s Washington.”

Mr. Mattis responded by saying he had never been affiliated with any political party.

The unexpected timing of the resignation left Mr. Trump with no clear favorite as a replacement. One long-rumored candidate is Sen. Tom Cotton, a hawkish Arkansas Republican who received the Bronze Star while serving in the Army in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Before ascending to the defense secretary post, Mr. Mattis‘ nickname in the media was “Mad Dog Mattis” — a moniker that reporters often used to describe the respect he had from rank-and-file soldiers in the field.

But it may also have been tied to Mr. Mattis‘ notoriously bare-knuckle demeanor as a combat general in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, where he offered sharp-tongued quotes to the press.

He was quoted as saying that a good soldier “follows orders, but a true warrior wears his enemy’s skin like a poncho,” and to live by the motto: “Be polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet.”

The retired Marine general said during his defense secretary confirmation hearing in January 2017 that the “nickname was given to me by the press.”

“Perhaps they didn’t get it quite right,” he added, suggesting he wasn’t entirely comfortable with the moniker.

Some reports have noted that the nickname is never used by Mr. Mattis‘ close friends, who regard him as a kind and studious man, who is so well-read in military history that he has a penchant for saying memorable things of his own.

US President Donald Trump has asked the Pentagon to organise a large military parade in the nation's capital.

The president made the request of top military chiefs in late January, after reportedly being impressed by a French Bastille Day parade last year.

Democrats compared the plan to displays of military might organised by autocratic nations.

Commentators say a US parade would be extremely expensive, given the cost of bringing military hardware and personnel to the capital and protecting its streets from tanks designed for war zones.

Does everyone like the idea?

Democratic politicians have criticised the expense and said such ideas carry worrying symbolism.

""What an absurd waste of money!"" tweeted Representative Jim McGovern. ""Trump acts more like dictator than president. Americans deserve better.""

Representative Jackie Speier, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, told CNN: ""I was stunned by it, to be quite honest... we have a Napoleon in the making here.""

How unusual is this?

Large-scale military parades are seen by many as a relic of a bygone era and the Cold War, but they remain a common occurrence in many states - Communist and former Soviet nations and beyond.

North Korea is probably the best-known for its spectacular displays - with an enormous show to take place on Thursday.

Mr Trump also enjoyed a display of military might during his visit to China last November. Russia enjoys showing off its latest military hardware at its frequent parades.

But they are regular in other countries - Venezuela, Iran and Brazil all enjoy putting on a spectacle.

In France, the annual Bastille Day parade, which was beefed up after the November 2015 terror attacks, harks back to France's militaristic past. An extravagant show in Saudi Arabia last year also reflected security concerns ahead of the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca.

James Mattis to be his secretary of defense , tapping yet another outspoken ex-military leader who butted heads with the Obama administration to shape and carry out his national security strategy .
If confirmed , the highly decorated battlefield commander would be only the second retired general to become defense secretary — and would require a special waiver from Congress in the form of separate legislation .
“ I will not tell you that one of our great , great generals — don ’ t let it outside of this room , ” Trump teased a rally in Cincinnati Thursday night , playing up the drama . “ We are going to appoint 'Mad Dog ' Mattis as our secretary of defense … but we are not announcing it until Monday , so don ’ t tell anyone . He ’ s great . ”
`` They say he ’ s the closest thing to Gen. George Patton that we have and it ’ s about time , '' he added , referring to the impolitic and aggressive battlefield commander in World War II . `` It ’ s about time . ”
Hours earlier , Trump 's transition team had denied that he had settled on a defense secretary despite a report in The Washington Post that Mattis was the choice . `` No decision has been made yet with regard to Secretary of Defense , '' spokesman Jason Miller tweeted at 4:40 p.m .
Mattis , 66 , so nicknamed for his salty language and obsessive dedication to the military , was the top U.S. commander in Iraq and Afghanistan from 2010 to 2013 . He had earlier co-authored a counterinsurgency strategy manual credited with helping to halt some of the worst sectarian violence in Iraq before the U.S. military withdrawal in December 2011 .
But as head of the U.S. Central Command he also clashed with President Barack Obama 's National Security Council , particularly over Iran , which Mattis has called “ the single most enduring threat to stability and peace in the Middle East . ''
It 's a view that aligns more closely with Trump and his pick for White House national security adviser , retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn , whom the Obama administration had removed as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014 . Both Trump and Flynn have advocated pulling out of an agreement reached with Iran last year to curtail its nuclear weapons program in exchange for a lifting of economic sanctions and eventually removing the arms embargo .
Yet not all of Mattis ' views are so in sync with Trump and Flynn , who have made friendly gestures to Russian President Vladimir Putin . Mattis has expressed deep wariness of Russia 's intentions , saying it wants “ to break NATO apart . ”
During the campaign Mattis did not hold back in criticizing Trump and some of his rhetoric , including the president-elect 's comments that NATO was obsolete and that its members do n't pay their fair share .
“ Some of those allies have lost more troops per capita in Afghanistan than we have , ’ ’ Mattis , who also served as NATO ’ s supreme allied commander for transformation , told ███ in July . “ Some of them are spending 20 percent of their national budget on defense . ”
View Trump announces his pick for General 'Mad Dog ' Mattis as defense secretary At a rally in Cincinnati on Thursday , President-elect Donald Trump announced that he picked retired Marine Gen. James Mattis to be his secretary of defense .
On Trump ’ s call for a ban on Muslim immigrants , Mattis said that such talk prompts U.S. allies to think “ we have lost faith in reason . ”
“ They think we ’ ve completely lost it , '' he said . `` This kind of thing is causing us great damage right now , and it ’ s sending shock waves through this international system . ''
The general has also espoused some views that break with the majority of his fellow military leaders . He has expressed reservations about allowing women to serve in combat , telling the Marines ' Memorial Club in San Francisco that `` the idea of putting women in there is not setting them up for success . '' He has also questioned whether the U.S. nuclear arsenal needs to consist of submarines , bombers and land-based missiles . `` Is it time to reduce the Triad to a Diad , removing the land‐based missiles ? '' he asked the Senate Armed Services Committee last year .
The pick was swiftly lauded by the GOP national security establishment .
`` He brings a clear-eyed view to the potential adversaries our nation faces , including Russia , '' Tom Spoehr , director of the Center for National Defense at the conservative Heritage Foundation , said in a statement , calling the general `` an outstanding selection for this critically important position . ''
Mattis has key backers on Capitol Hill , including Sen. John McCain , the Arizona Republican who chairs the Armed Services Committee , which would lead the confirmation process .
`` General Mattis is one of the finest military officers of his generation and an extraordinary leader who inspires a rare and special admiration of his troops , '' McCain said in a recent statement . `` He is a forthright strategic thinker . His integrity is unshakable and unquestionable . And he has earned his knowledge and experience the old-fashioned way : in the crucible of our nation 's defense and the service of heroes .
“ General Mattis has a clear understanding of the many challenges facing the Department of Defense , the U.S. military and our national security , '' McCain added .
Since retiring from the Marine Corps , Mattis has served on the board of defense giant General Dynamics , as well as Theranos , a Silicon Valley biotech company that came under scrutiny for its business practices — and which Mattis reportedly advocated on behalf of before the military despite agreeing not to .
He 's also a fellow at the Hoover Institution , a conservative think tank at Stanford University in Palo Alto , Calif. , and has done some private consulting .
Mattis ' elevation to Trump 's Cabinet would make him a first among equals .
Apart from the president , only the defense secretary has the legal authority to order the military into action . And while the decision to launch a nuclear attack rests solely with the commander-in-chief , the procedures require secondary confirmation from the defense secretary , though he does not get a veto .

Hundreds of people have called on Trump ’ s Manhattan office , rural New Jersey getaway and Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida over the past two months ; here ’ s a day-by-day look at some of the people who have visited since Trump was elected .
But to get the job Mattis will need something highly unusual : a waiver . As a result , his selection is viewed by some as a major departure from tradition .
Mattis is technically ineligible to be Defense secretary because the law requires retired military officers to be out of uniform for seven years before they can become the military 's civilian leader . That 's in an effort to ensure that civilian control of the armed forces , a bedrock of the American democratic tradition , remains inviolate .
Unless Congress votes and the president signs an exception , `` a person may not be appointed as secretary of defense within seven years after relief from active duty as a commissioned officer of a regular component of an armed force , '' the law says .
`` It happened once , '' Harold Brown , who was defense secretary under President Jimmy Carter from 1977 to 1981 , told ███ . `` And that was George Marshall , '' the Army 's legendary chief of staff in World War II , who went to become both secretary of State and secretary of defense under President Harry Truman . `` Congress had to pass a separate law exempting him . ''
In 1994 , President Bill Clinton picked retired Adm. Bobby Inman to be Defense secretary , but he had been off of active duty for the required period and his nomination was ultimately withdrawn anyway .
When Congress passed a waiver for Marshall in 1950 , it made clear it did not want to set a precedent .
`` It is hereby expressed as the intent of the Congress that the authority granted by this Act is not to be construed as approval by the Congress of continuing appointments of military men to the office of Secretary of Defense in the future , '' its report accompanying the legislation said . `` It is hereby expressed as the sense of the Congress that after General Marshall leaves the office of secretary of defense , no additional appointments of military men to that office shall be approved . ''

`` The Congress ' report at the time said it is very unusual , '' Brown said , `` and should probably never happen again . This is a significant barrier , though it is not an insuperable one . The Trump administration would have to make a very compelling case . Mattis does n't have the standing of George Marshall . They 'd have to make the case he is another George Marshall . ''
Earlier this year , a bloc of GOP hawks who opposed Trump 's candidacy tried to persuade Mattis to run for president as a third-party candidate , though he expressed no interest .
Congressional aides say work is already underway to determine the legislative language needed to grant Mattis a waiver .
Arnold Punaro , a former staff member of the Senate Armed Services Committee who helped craft the current statute , said that while Mattis ' waiver would need to be approved by both houses of Congress and signed by the president , he does not see it as a major problem .
`` He would not in any way undermine or erode civilian control of the military , and it would be hard to find someone who would be less likely to be pushed around by the military and he is now a civilian and would be firmly in charge , '' said Punaro , calling Mattis a `` stellar choice . ''
One of Mattis ' fellow retired generals also does n't anticipate it will pose much of a roadblock .
`` Waivers are waivers , '' said retired Army Lt. Gen. Mick Bednarek , who until last year was the top U.S. military adviser in Iraq . `` In the case of Jim Mattis , that would not be too contentious . The real issue is his views and perspectives . ''
“ While I deeply respect General Mattis ’ s service , I will oppose a waiver , ” Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York , a senior Democrat on the Armed Services Committee , ” said in a statement Thursday night . “ Civilian control of our military is a fundamental principle of American democracy , and I will not vote for an exception to this rule . ”
Others demanded that his views on torture and other human rights concerns be key to the Senate confirmation process .
“ We have real concerns about human rights in a Trump Administration , and we will demand that the Senate press General Mattis about his specific views and positions , ” Naureen Shah , director of Amnesty International USA ’ s security with human rights program , said in a statement .
Mattis is known as one of the most blunt battlefield commanders of his generation . He is mostly revered — but also reviled by some — for his rough edges and controversial comments , traits that have gotten him into hot water .
“ You go into Afghanistan , you got guys who slap around women for five years because they didn ’ t wear a veil , ” he said in in 2005 . “ You know guys like that ain ’ t got no manhood left anyway , so it ’ s a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them . ”
Also in his rhetorical repertoire : “ The first time you blow someone away is not an insignificant event . That said , there are some a -- -- -- - in the world that just need to be shot . ”
But despite his candor , Mattis is also considered a “ warrior monk '' for the library of books he carried from post to post , ranging from Roman philosophy to Sun Tzu 's `` The Art of War . ''
“ You are part of the world ’ s most feared and trusted force , '' he once told forces under his command . `` Engage your brain before you engage your weapon . ”
Mattis , who is unmarried , was also known as the rare commander who could be found visiting his troops in their fighting positions , or volunteering to be the watch officer on Christmas so one of his underlings could be with his family .
`` His dedication is unparalleled . He is married to the the nation , '' Bednarek told ███ . `` He has a 100 percent focus on mission accomplishment . His forte is his leadership and his thoughtfulness . ''
Retired Adm. William Fallon , who was Mattis ' boss early in the Iraq War , said he believes Mattis may be just the right person to run the Pentagon .
While he has vast experience in war , he has also been outspoken in recent years about the need for clearer goals and policies to guide it .
`` The most important thing is that Jim 's got a really good understanding that you need to have a good policy framework before digging foxholes , '' Fallon told ███ . `` He has been urging leadership to focus on coming up with policies before sending troops into action . ''
`` That is what is really needed right now , '' Fallon added .","President-elect Donald Trump has picked retired Marine Gen.

""Congress had to pass a separate law exempting him.""

In 1994, President Bill Clinton picked retired Adm. Bobby Inman to be Defense secretary, but he had been off of active duty for the required period and his nomination was ultimately withdrawn anyway.

When Congress passed a waiver for Marshall in 1950, it made clear it did not want to set a precedent.

""It is hereby expressed as the intent of the Congress that the authority granted by this Act is not to be construed as approval by the Congress of continuing appointments of military men to the office of Secretary of Defense in the future,"" its report accompanying the legislation said. ""It is hereby expressed as the sense of the Congress that after General Marshall leaves the office of secretary of defense, no additional appointments of military men to that office shall be approved.""

""The Congress' report at the time said it is very unusual,"" Brown said, ""and should probably never happen again. This is a significant barrier, though it is not an insuperable one. The Trump administration would have to make a very compelling case. Mattis doesn't have the standing of George Marshall. They'd have to make the case he is another George Marshall.""

Some Republicans think he may be.

Earlier this year, a bloc of GOP hawks who opposed Trump's candidacy tried to persuade Mattis to run for president as a third-party candidate, though he expressed no interest.

Congressional aides say work is already underway to determine the legislative language needed to grant Mattis a waiver.

Arnold Punaro, a former staff member of the Senate Armed Services Committee who helped craft the current statute, said that while Mattis' waiver would need to be approved by both houses of Congress and signed by the president, he does not see it as a major problem.

""He would not in any way undermine or erode civilian control of the military, and it would be hard to find someone who would be less likely to be pushed around by the military and he is now a civilian and would be firmly in charge,"" said Punaro, calling Mattis a ""stellar choice.""

One of Mattis' fellow retired generals also doesn't anticipate it will pose much of a roadblock.

""Waivers are waivers,"" said retired Army Lt. Gen. Mick Bednarek, who until last year was the top U.S. military adviser in Iraq. ""In the case of Jim Mattis, that would not be too contentious. The real issue is his views and perspectives.""

But the waiver is going to meet some resistance.

“While I deeply respect General Mattis’s service, I will oppose a waiver,” Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, a senior Democrat on the Armed Services Committee,” said in a statement Thursday night. “Civilian control of our military is a fundamental principle of American democracy, and I will not vote for an exception to this rule.”

Others demanded that his views on torture and other human rights concerns be key to the Senate confirmation process.

“We have real concerns about human rights in a Trump Administration, and we will demand that the Senate press General Mattis about his specific views and positions,” Naureen Shah, director of Amnesty International USA’s security with human rights program, said in a statement.

Mattis is known as one of the most blunt battlefield commanders of his generation. He is mostly revered — but also reviled by some — for his rough edges and controversial comments, traits that have gotten him into hot water.

“You go into Afghanistan, you got guys who slap around women for five years because they didn’t wear a veil,” he said in in 2005. “You know guys like that ain’t got no manhood left anyway, so it’s a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them.”

Also in his rhetorical repertoire: “The first time you blow someone away is not an insignificant event. That said, there are some a------- in the world that just need to be shot.”

But despite his candor, Mattis is also considered a “warrior monk"" for the library of books he carried from post to post, ranging from Roman philosophy to Sun Tzu's ""The Art of War.""

“You are part of the world’s most feared and trusted force,"" he once told forces under his command. ""Engage your brain before you engage your weapon.”

Mattis, who is unmarried, was also known as the rare commander who could be found visiting his troops in their fighting positions, or volunteering to be the watch officer on Christmas so one of his underlings could be with his family.

""His dedication is unparalleled. He is married to the the nation,"" Bednarek told POLITICO. ""He has a 100 percent focus on mission accomplishment. His forte is his leadership and his thoughtfulness.""

Retired Adm. William Fallon, who was Mattis' boss early in the Iraq War, said he believes Mattis may be just the right person to run the Pentagon.

While he has vast experience in war, he has also been outspoken in recent years about the need for clearer goals and policies to guide it.

""The most important thing is that Jim's got a really good understanding that you need to have a good policy framework before digging foxholes,"" Fallon told POLITICO. ""He has been urging leadership to focus on coming up with policies before sending troops into action.""

""That is what is really needed right now,"" Fallon added.

defense,Daily Beast,0,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-pentagon-has-prepared-a-cyber-attack-against-russia?ref=home,The Pentagon Has Prepared a Cyberattack Against Russia,2018-11-02,,"The U.S. intelligence community and the Pentagon have quietly agreed on the outlines of an offensive cyberattack that the United States would unleash if Russia electronically interferes with the 2018 midterm election on Nov. 6 , according to current and former senior U.S. officials who are familiar with the plan .
In preparation for its potential use , U.S. military hackers have been given the go-ahead to gain access to Russian cybersystems that they feel is needed to let the plan unfold quickly , the officials said .
The effort constitutes one of the first major cyberbattle plans organized under a new government policy enabling potential offensive operations to proceed more quickly once the parameters have been worked out in advance and agreed among key agencies .
While U.S. national-security officials have so far reported only intermittent efforts by Russian sources to compromise political organizations and campaigns , they have been worried—in the aftermath of Russia ’ s digital contact with U.S. election systems in 2016—that Moscow might unleash more aggressive interference in the hours before voting begins , while the polls are open , or when the votes are being tabulated .
The existence of such a plan means that America is more fully integrating offensive cyberattacks into its overall military planning systems , a move likely to make cybercombat more likely and eventually more commonplace , sometimes without first gaining specific presidential approval . Cyberattacks are now on a more obvious path , in short , to becoming a regular currency of warfare .
The plan for retaliation against Russia is one of the first to be organized since President Donald Trump signed an executive order in August that simplifies and shortens the review for such operations . It has the effect—according to those familiar with the process—of giving the Pentagon additional prerogatives to prepare for strikes . It also preemptively addresses traditional intelligence community concerns that cyberattacks will compromise ongoing or future intelligence-gathering by exposing U.S. data collection operations .
The officials declined to provide details about what the United States will do in response to Russian interference in the election . But administration officials have made clear that the trigger for a broader response would have to be something more than “ malign influence ... trying to sway peoples ’ opinion or the way people might vote , ” as a senior administration official put it on a call with reporters on Oct. 31 organized by the White House . “ This is something that has happened since the dawn of the republic . ”
Social-media influence operations , widely used by Russia in 2016 and again over the past two years , were the focus of an indictment by the Justice Department of Russian national Elena Alekseevna Khusyaynova unveiled Oct. 19 , in which she was charged with conspiring with others against the United States .
The senior official clarified that it would be direct interference—efforts to tamper with voting registration and recording votes—that would bring “ swift and severe action. ” The reason , the official said , is “ that fundamentally wrecks the natural process that we have established in this country. ” That official didn ’ t describe what the U.S. action would be .
In 2016 Russian hackers tried to break into the election systems of at least 21 states , although some were not notified by Washington until September 2017 . In at least one state , Illinois , Russian hackers managed to gain access to voter registration data , although state officials said that none of the information was altered . Several other state systems were rumored to have been breached , although none have publicly confirmed it .
Officials say the new Trump cyberoperations order , National Security Presidential Memorandum 13 ( NSPM 13 ) , is designed to allow Defense Secretary James Mattis and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats to approve retaliatory strikes without the approval of others in the government , and in certain cases without White House approval .
It replaces an Obama-era executive order that required more extensive review before cyberweapons could be used offensively , called Presidential Policy Directive 20 ( PPD 20 ) . That order was classified but became public when former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked it in 2013 , as part of a broader effort by him to expose the scale of American cyberspying .
One of the key , unpublicized consequences of the new directive is that military planners can prepare for cyberstrikes—as called for in interagency agreements in advance—by gaining access to the computer systems of potential targets well before any order has been given to attack , or even before a foreign attack has occurred , the officials said . That access is meant to pave the way for deploying malware—packages of compromising computer instructions—swiftly inside foreign networks and servers , when a decision is made to proceed .
“ The trigger for retaliation would have to be something more than ‘ trying to sway peoples ’ opinion or the way people might vote. ’ It 's direct interference—efforts to tamper with voting registration and recording votes—that would bring ‘ swift and severe action . ’ ”
According to the officials ’ accounts , military planners in the past were sometimes held back by the intelligence community from hacking into foreign networks for fear of compromising access that spies considered useful for collecting information , particularly when it was uncertain whether any offensive operation would eventually be approved . With only a small number of skilled military hackers available , they were also hesitant to invest time in gaining access to systems not explicitly part of an approved strike .
Obama ’ s order allowed for emergency defensive actions by the heads of U.S. agencies , but required a much more protracted process for the premeditated deployment of cyberweapons . Major attacks had to be directly approved by the president , while other smaller operations required the signoff of three committees including a policy coordination committee , the National Security Council ’ s Deputies Committee and the Principals Committee , which military officials complained included agencies without a direct connection to the issues associated with cyberattacks .
“ The Department of Defense ( DoD ) would get frustrated when Transportation , or another agency , would weigh in on things they wanted to do , ” a former national security official who worked for both Democratic and Republican presidents said . “ If DoD wanted to have access and be ready , they were hamstrung . ”
One of the U.S. officials used an analogy to describe the new approach : Spy agencies , the official said , sometimes try to place an agent in a service position at a facility run by an adversary . That agent ’ s assignment would be to learn access codes , map the facility and conduct wide surveillance of its operations , copy sets of keys , and perhaps unlock doors . That information and access would allow the intelligence agency , in theory , to sneak a bomb into the facility when it wants to .
This is what the military is now authorized to do after an interagency agreement has been reached that a particular major threat exists that might warrant a swift and effective cyberresponse , the officials said . It essentially is meant to ensure that U.S. cyberwarriors can quickly drop off weapons when needed . “ You don ’ t need to pre-position something if you have the right access , ” said one of the officials .
While some officials and cyberexperts have said that certain offensive cyberoperations risk violating international law , because of the possibility they might cause collateral damage and harm civilians outside target networks , government lawyers have approved the new approach after deciding that letting the military hack into a foreign system is not an act of war , so long as a cyberweapon hasn ’ t yet been emplaced and the specific system being targeted isn ’ t actually destroyed .
While declining to discuss specifics about the new directive or any potential cyberoperations , Grant Schneider , a senior director for cybersecurity at the National Security Council , said in an interview after an appearance at a public event that advance military planning would help speed up cyber-responses . “ It allows for agencies to start making plans sooner , start identifying potential targets sooner , and start being able to have impacts sooner , ” he said .
NSPM 13 , which remains classified , was the backbone of Trump ’ s new National Cyber Strategy , a mostly unclassified public document which was released in September .
That strategy was rolled out with descriptions from National Security Adviser John Bolton of a more aggressive use of cyberweapons , consistent with his general foreign-policy stance since taking the job in April . At that time officials declined to provide any specifics on how the new policy would make cyber-response faster , or cut down on red tape , but claimed it would do both .
During a press conference on September 20 to roll out the new cyberstrategy , Bolton said that “ for any nation that ’ s taking cyberactivity against the United States , they should expect , and this is part of creating structures of deterrence , so that it 's publicly known as well , we will respond offensively as well as defensively. ” During a speech on Oct. 31 , he said the United States was “ right now undertaking offensive cyberoperations ” to safeguard the election , without detailing what those are .
According to sources , the new executive order , NSPM 13 , is designed around the idea of pre-approved Concepts of Operation—one of the first of which is the plan to act against Russia if key red lines are crossed . The concepts set the types of targets and the boundaries for types of action through coordination between agencies .
It doesn ’ t require a full meeting of Cabinet officials and can exclude some of the decision makers who were part of the PPD 20 process . Most of the coordination will take place between the Office of the Director of National Intelligence , the Pentagon , and the Department of Homeland Security , according to sources .
“ The concept is that you would approve a category of activities against a defined adversary , that would be pre-approved by the appropriate people , within some left-and-right bounds , ” one of the officials said . Once a concept is approved , an agency can scout a target and gain access , and sometimes might go ahead and take action with limited notice to other coordinating agencies .
While several Obama-era officials said that the new approach sounded like a step in the right direction , others cautioned that a procedure providing earlier approval with fewer consulting officials could mean that larger concerns about an offensive cyberoperation won ’ t be heard .
“ We ’ re in a really deep deterrence hole to Russia right now . The costs we have imposed have been flea bites , and so we ’ re not affecting [ Russia ’ s ] calculus , ” Michèle Flournoy , a former Pentagon policy chief and co-founder of the Center for a New American Security think tank , said in an interview . “ They aren ’ t feeling very threatened. ” But she added that “ where I would be concerned is if authorities [ for offensive operations ] were delegated down to a low level , and it was absent a larger strategy . ”
A former senior official who served in the Trump White House separately expressed concerns that the military might not understand that cyberweapons are only one of many tools available for responding to a cyberattack . “ They have to have some understanding that we don ’ t just build tools to wreak havoc , ” the official said .
Chris Painter , who served as the top U.S. “ cyber diplomat ” at the State Department from 2011 to 2017 , said the Obama administration deliberately sought extensive interagency consultation “ to make sure that we were considering all the different policy aspects. ” But he agrees that the procedures could have been streamlined .
Schneider , the NSC official , said that the perception was that PPD 20 slowed down the potential use of cyberweapons . “ The old process , in PPD 20 , whether it was in reality or in lore , was that everything was going to have to go to the president ’ s desk in order to do anything . And getting on the president ’ s desk is a challenge , and so that sapped time away from what they wanted , ” he said .
But the biggest fights , according to several former officials , came between intelligence leaders trying to protect streams of information coming from adversary ’ s networks and military leaders looking to strike .
“ In practice , whenever we came up with a scenario where we wanted to take action , they [ intelligence officials ] spent most of their time arguing that any action could harm their access , ” one of the former national-security officials said .
Asked about protection against Russian election meddling during the rollout of the new cyberstrategy , Bolton pointed to the new executive order as helping unleash U.S. capability . “ It ’ s one of the reasons why our decision to reverse this PPD 20 from the Obama administration on offensive cyberactions , we think , is so important , ” Bolton said . “ Our hands are not tied as they were in the Obama administration . ”
Here ’ s how the process works : Military planners and cyberexperts from the civilian intelligence agencies start by finding weaknesses in software security as part of something called the Vulnerabilities Equities Process .
Its general outlines were disclosed in late 2017 , when public documents stated that government hackers tell software makers about roughly 90 percent of the vulnerabilities they find while testing nearly every widely used piece of software . A former official familiar with the program confirmed that figure , noting that there is some monthly fluctuation , and saying that many of the public security fixes included in operating system updates are actually first uncovered by government hackers .
“ The 10 percent we keep is for our national security purposes , ” a former White House official said . “ We keep them for a reason . ”
The military and intelligence agencies then deploy those vulnerabilities whenever they need to break into systems . The public got a hint of the types of inroads government hackers can make when some pathways stockpiled by the National Security Agency were collected by a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers , which released them publicly beginning in 2016 . One of those vulnerabilities served as the backbone of the WannaCry attack , which the Trump administration publicly blamed on North Korean hackers , and which eventually spread to 300,000 computers in 150 countries in 2017 .

The U.S. intelligence community and the Pentagon have quietly agreed on the outlines of an offensive cyberattack that the United States would unleash if Russia electronically interferes with the 2018 midterm election on Nov. 6, according to current and former senior U.S. officials who are familiar with the plan.

In preparation for its potential use, U.S. military hackers have been given the go-ahead to gain access to Russian cybersystems that they feel is needed to let the plan unfold quickly, the officials said.

The effort constitutes one of the first major cyberbattle plans organized under a new government policy enabling potential offensive operations to proceed more quickly once the parameters have been worked out in advance and agreed among key agencies.

While U.S. national-security officials have so far reported only intermittent efforts by Russian sources to compromise political organizations and campaigns, they have been worried—in the aftermath of Russia’s digital contact with U.S. election systems in 2016—that Moscow might unleash more aggressive interference in the hours before voting begins, while the polls are open, or when the votes are being tabulated.

The existence of such a plan means that America is more fully integrating offensive cyberattacks into its overall military planning systems, a move likely to make cybercombat more likely and eventually more commonplace, sometimes without first gaining specific presidential approval. Cyberattacks are now on a more obvious path, in short, to becoming a regular currency of warfare.

The plan for retaliation against Russia is one of the first to be organized since President Donald Trump signed an executive order in August that simplifies and shortens the review for such operations. It has the effect—according to those familiar with the process—of giving the Pentagon additional prerogatives to prepare for strikes. It also preemptively addresses traditional intelligence community concerns that cyberattacks will compromise ongoing or future intelligence-gathering by exposing U.S. data collection operations.

The officials declined to provide details about what the United States will do in response to Russian interference in the election. But administration officials have made clear that the trigger for a broader response would have to be something more than “malign influence... trying to sway peoples’ opinion or the way people might vote,” as a senior administration official put it on a call with reporters on Oct. 31 organized by the White House. “This is something that has happened since the dawn of the republic.”

Social-media influence operations, widely used by Russia in 2016 and again over the past two years, were the focus of an indictment by the Justice Department of Russian national Elena Alekseevna Khusyaynova unveiled Oct. 19, in which she was charged with conspiring with others against the United States.

The senior official clarified that it would be direct interference—efforts to tamper with voting registration and recording votes—that would bring “swift and severe action.” The reason, the official said, is “that fundamentally wrecks the natural process that we have established in this country.” That official didn’t describe what the U.S. action would be.

Although the story so far is of a personal failing, it's possible that the widening sex scandal surrounding retired Gen. David Petraeus will begin to affect the military's reputation as a whole.

""David Petraeus suddenly falling that far off that high a pedestal is feeding into the question: Have we been giving these guys too much of a pass?"" says Barbara Bodine, who teaches public affairs at Princeton University.

There's been a decline in respect for other institutions — sometimes, although not always, due to sex scandals, as in the case of the Catholic Church, college football and numerous members of Congress and other politicians.

The military, by contrast, has been seen as highly competent through a long decade of war. The reputation of its leadership — distinct from the errors of some troops in the field — has been solid, insulated to a large extent from outside questioning and accountability.

The broadening scandal involving Petraeus, who left the Army last year to head the CIA, may lead to a recalibration of the terms in which the military is discussed, monitored and regulated by civilian authorities, although there's no guarantee of that.

""It damages the military's reputation to the degree that that reputation has been inflated in a whole number of areas to include their moral uprightness or their status as paragons of virtues,"" says Richard Kohn, a military historian at the University of North Carolina. ""What's likely to happen is just a reminder to the American people that they're human beings, like others.""

The Other 1 Percent

Members of the military have been operating in separate realms from civilian life. Most active-duty members of the military serve in and hail from the South. Even veterans are highly concentrated in a limited number of areas.

Thirty years ago, at least 10 percent of the population in 80 percent of all the counties in America had served in the military. By 2010, you could find a population with 10 percent veterans in just over one-fourth of all counties, according to Western Washington University sociologist Jay Teachman.

People who served in the military are now separate from — and held in higher esteem — than the general run of the population as a whole. Civilians are left feeling ""guilty"" about their lack of service, Bodine says — and aren't asking tough enough questions when it comes to things like military budgets.

""As the number of veterans in Congress has decreased, the adulation of the military has rapidly increased,"" says Bodine, a former State Department official who served as ambassador to Yemen.

Questioning Pentagon spending, whether during the Iraq War or the current debate over sequestration of the military budget, is seen as somehow not ""supporting the troops.""

""Since Vietnam, we have come to a very dangerous bargain,"" says Diane Mazur, author of A More Perfect Military. ""You don't ask me to serve in the military, and in return I will not ask questions or be difficult or demand accountability.""

Thousands Of Assaults

That lack of accountability, Mazur says, extends to sexual misconduct.

By all accounts thus far, Petraeus engaged in a consensual affair that took place after he left the military. But there have been numerous recent instances of military leaders relieved of command and charged with sexual crimes. In all, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta estimates there were nearly 19,000 cases of sexual violence within the military in 2011 alone.

'Arrogance Reinforced By Insularity'

The courts have contributed to this problem, Mazur argues, by leaving it largely to the military to police itself when it comes to sexual violence.

The military has its own courts, its own schools and its own culture — one that has received excessive deference from civilian authorities, says Lawrence Korb, a former assistant secretary of defense who is now at the Center for American Progress.

A recent book highlights the problem of incompetent generals not being taken to task for failed performance.

defense,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/nov/13/scandal-widens-probe-gen-john-allens-emails/,Petraeus scandal widens; second general ensnared in email probe,2012-11-13,"Pete Yost, Robert Burns","WASHINGTON ( AP ) — The sex scandal that led to CIA Director David Petraeus ‘ downfall widened Tuesday with word the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan is under investigation for thousands of alleged “ inappropriate communications ” with another woman involved in the case . Some of the material was “ flirtatious , ” an official said .
Even as the FBI prepared a timeline for Congress about the investigation that brought to light Petraeus ‘ extramarital affair with his biographer , Paula Broadwell , Defense Secretary Leon Panetta revealed that the Pentagon had begun an internal investigation into emails between Gen. John Allen and a Florida woman involved in the case .
Some of the 20,000-plus pages of documents and emails between Allen and Tampa socialite Jill Kelley were “ flirtatious , ” according to a senior defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn ’ t authorized to discuss the case publicly . It wasn ’ t immediately clear who wrote the flirtatious notes — Allen , Kelley or both .
Allen succeeded Petraeus as the top American commander in Afghanistan in July 2011 , and his nomination to become the next commander of U.S. European Command and the commander of NATO forces in Europe has now been put on hold , as the scandal seemed certain to ensnare another acclaimed military figure .
In a White House statement early Tuesday , National Security spokesman Tommy Vietor said President Barack Obama has held Allen ’ s nomination at Panetta ’ s request . Obama , the statement said , “ remains focused on fully supporting our extraordinary troops and coalition partners in Afghanistan , who Gen. Allen continues to lead as he has so ably done for over a year . ”
It was Broadwell ’ s threatening emails to Kelley , a Petraeus family friend , that led to the FBI ’ s discovery of communications between Broadwell and Petraeus indicating they were having an affair . Petraeus acknowledged the affair when he resigned from the CIA post on Friday .
In the latest revelations , a Pentagon official traveling with Panetta to Australia said “ inappropriate communications ” — 20,000 to 30,000 pages of emails and other documents from Allen ’ s communications with Kelley between 2010 and 2012 — are under review . The official would not say whether they involved sexual matters or whether they are thought to include unauthorized disclosures of classified information . He said he did not know whether Petraeus is mentioned in the emails .
Allen has denied wrongdoing . He was due to give Panetta a recommendation soon on the pace of U.S. troop withdrawals in 2013 . If Allen was found to have had an affair with Kelley , he could face charges of adultery , which is a crime under the Uniform Code of Military Justice .
The decision by the FBI to hand off the Allen information to the military seems to indicate the issue is not one involving the handling of classified information , but rather some other issue .
The Petraeus case has sparked an uproar in Congress , with lawmakers complaining they should have been told earlier about the probe that has roiled the intelligence and military establishment .
Rep. Peter King , R-N.Y. , chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee , called the latest revelations in the case “ a Greek tragedy . ”
“ It ’ s just tragic , ” King said Tuesday on NBC ’ s “ Today ” show . “ This has the elements in some ways of a Hollywood movie or a trashy novel . ”
The issue of what the FBI knew , when it notified top Obama administration officials , and when Congress was told , has brought criticism from lawmakers , who say they should have been told earlier .
The White House wasn ’ t informed of the FBI investigation that involved Petraeus until Nov. 6 , Election Day , although agents began looking at Petraeus ‘ actions months earlier , sometime during the summer . Senate Intelligence Committee chairwoman Dianne Feinstein , D-Calif. , complained that she first learned of the matter from the media late last week , and confirmed it in a phone call to the then-CIA director on Friday .
That was the same day Obama accepted Petraeus ‘ resignation , and the 60-year-old retired Army general , who headed U.S. military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan before taking charge of the CIA , acknowledged an affair with Broadwell , and expressed regret .
Defending the notification timing , a senior federal law enforcement official pointed Monday to longstanding policies and practices , adopted following abuses and mistakes that were uncovered during the Nixon administration ’ s Watergate scandal of the early 1970s . The Justice Department — of which the FBI is part — is supposed to refrain from sharing detailed information about its criminal investigations with the White House .
The FBI also looked into whether a separate set of emails between Petraeus and Broadwell might involve any security breach . That will be a key question Wednesday in meetings involving congressional intelligence committee leaders , FBI deputy director Sean Joyce and CIA deputy director Michael Morell .
A federal law enforcement official , speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss details of the investigation , said the FBI had concluded relatively quickly — and certainly by late summer at the latest — that there was no security breach . Absent a security breach , it was appropriate not to notify Congress or the White House earlier , this official said .
Extramarital affairs are viewed as particularly risky for intelligence officers because they might be blackmailed to keep the affair quiet . For military personnel , adultery is a crime under the Uniform Code of Military Justice .
According to two federal law enforcement officials , the FBI initially began a criminal investigation of unsigned , harassing emails that were sent , beginning last May , to Kelley , a Tampa socialite . She and her husband , Scott , were longtime friends of Petraeus and his wife , Holly . FBI agents traced the alleged cyber harassment to Broadwell and during that process discovered she was exchanging intimate messages with a private Gmail account . Further investigation revealed that account belonged to Petraeus , under an alias .
Petraeus and Broadwell apparently used a trick , known to terrorists and teenagers alike , to conceal their email traffic , one of the law enforcement officials said .
Rather than transmitting emails to the other ’ s inbox , they composed at least some messages and instead of transmitting them , left them in a draft folder or in an electronic “ dropbox , ” the official said . Then the other person could log onto the same account and read the draft emails there . This avoids creating an email trail that is easier for outsiders to intercept or trace .
Agents later told Petraeus that Broadwell sent emails warning Kelley to stay away from the general and carrying a threatening tone .
Friends and former staff members of Petraeus told The Associated Press that he has assured them his relationship with Kelley was platonic , although Broadwell apparently saw her as a romantic rival . They said Petraeus was shocked to learn last summer of Broadwell ’ s emails to Kelley .
Petraeus also denied to these associates that he had given Broadwell any sensitive military information .
FBI agents who contacted Petraeus told him that sensitive , possibly classified documents related to Afghanistan were found on her computer , the general ’ s associates said . He assured investigators they did not come from him , and he mused to his associates that they were probably given to her on her reporting trips to Afghanistan by commanders she visited in the field there .
One associate also said Petraeus believes the documents described past operations and had already been declassified , although they might have still been marked “ secret . ”
Broadwell had high security clearances as part of her former job as a reserve Army major in military intelligence . But those clearances are only in effect when a soldier is on active duty , which she was not at the time she researched the Petraeus biography .
Nevertheless , FBI agents conducted a search of Broadwell ’ s Charlotte , N.C. , home on Monday . And the criminal investigation continued into the emails to Kelley , including whether Petraeus had any hand in them . At that point in late summer , FBI Director Robert Mueller and eventually Attorney General Eric Holder were notified that agents had uncovered what appeared to be an extramarital affair involving Petraeus .
Broadwell and Petraeus have each been questioned by FBI agents twice in recent weeks , with both acknowledging the affair in separate interviews . The FBI ’ s most recent interviews with Broadwell and with Petraeus both occurred during the week of Oct. 29 , days before the election , one of the law enforcement officials said . The FBI notified Obama ’ s director of national intelligence , James Clapper , of the investigation on Tuesday , Nov. 6 — Election Day .
In another twist , an FBI agent who was a friend of Kelley and who passed along information from her to the agents who conducted the investigation , was subsequently told by his superiors to steer clear of the case because they grew concerned that the agent had become obsessed with the investigation , a federal law enforcement official said . Before the case involving Petraeus got under way , the agent had sent Kelley shirtless photos of himself , according to this official , who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the investigation .
Broadwell co-authored a biography titled “ All In : The Education of General David Petraeus , ” published in January . She wrote that she met Petraeus in the spring of 2006 while she was a graduate student at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and she ended up following him on multiple trips to Afghanistan as part of her research .
Petraeus , 60 , told one former associate he began an affair with Broadwell , 40 , a couple of months after he became CIA director in September 2011 . They mutually agreed to end the affair four months ago , but they kept in contact because she was still writing a dissertation on his time commanding U.S. troops overseas , the associate said .
Petraeus told former staffers and friends that he had regularly visited the Kelleys ’ home overlooking Tampa Bay . Kelley , 37 , served as a sort of social ambassador for U.S. Central Command , hosting parties for the general when Petraeus was commander there from 2008-10 .
Jill Kelley regularly kept in touch with Petraeus when he became commander of the Afghanistan war effort , the two exchanging near-daily emails and instant messages , two of his former staffers said . But those messages were exchanged in accounts that his aides monitored as part of their duties and were not romantic in tone , the staffers said .
Petraeus and his family are devastated over the affair — especially Mrs. Petraeus , who “ is not exactly pleased right now ” after 38 years of marriage , said Steve Boylan , a friend and former Petraeus spokesman who spoke to him over the weekend .
Broadwell , married with two young sons , has not returned phone calls or emails seeking comment .
National Security writer Robert Burns reported from Perth , Australia . Associated Press writers Pauline Jelinek , Nedra Pickler , Larry Margasak and Adam Goldman contributed from Washington .","WASHINGTON (AP) — The sex scandal that led to CIA Director David Petraeus‘ downfall widened Tuesday with word the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan is under investigation for thousands of alleged “inappropriate communications” with another woman involved in the case. Some of the material was “flirtatious,” an official said.

Even as the FBI prepared a timeline for Congress about the investigation that brought to light Petraeus‘ extramarital affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta revealed that the Pentagon had begun an internal investigation into emails between Gen. John Allen and a Florida woman involved in the case.

Some of the 20,000-plus pages of documents and emails between Allen and Tampa socialite Jill Kelley were “flirtatious,” according to a senior defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to discuss the case publicly. It wasn’t immediately clear who wrote the flirtatious notes — Allen, Kelley or both.

Obama, the statement said, “remains focused on fully supporting our extraordinary troops and coalition partners in Afghanistan, who Gen. Allen continues to lead as he has so ably done for over a year.”

It was Broadwell’s threatening emails to Kelley, a Petraeus family friend, that led to the FBI’s discovery of communications between Broadwell and Petraeus indicating they were having an affair. Petraeus acknowledged the affair when he resigned from the CIA post on Friday.

In the latest revelations, a Pentagon official traveling with Panetta to Australia said “inappropriate communications” — 20,000 to 30,000 pages of emails and other documents from Allen’s communications with Kelley between 2010 and 2012 — are under review. The official would not say whether they involved sexual matters or whether they are thought to include unauthorized disclosures of classified information. He said he did not know whether Petraeus is mentioned in the emails.

Allen has denied wrongdoing. He was due to give Panetta a recommendation soon on the pace of U.S. troop withdrawals in 2013. If Allen was found to have had an affair with Kelley, he could face charges of adultery, which is a crime under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

The Petraeus case has sparked an uproar in Congress, with lawmakers complaining they should have been told earlier about the probe that has roiled the intelligence and military establishment.

Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, called the latest revelations in the case “a Greek tragedy.”

“It’s just tragic,” King said Tuesday on NBC’s “Today” show. “This has the elements in some ways of a Hollywood movie or a trashy novel.”

The issue of what the FBI knew, when it notified top Obama administration officials, and when Congress was told, has brought criticism from lawmakers, who say they should have been told earlier.

The White House wasn’t informed of the FBI investigation that involved Petraeus until Nov. 6, Election Day, although agents began looking at Petraeus‘ actions months earlier, sometime during the summer. Senate Intelligence Committee chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., complained that she first learned of the matter from the media late last week, and confirmed it in a phone call to the then-CIA director on Friday.

That was the same day Obama accepted Petraeus‘ resignation, and the 60-year-old retired Army general, who headed U.S. military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan before taking charge of the CIA, acknowledged an affair with Broadwell, and expressed regret.

Defending the notification timing, a senior federal law enforcement official pointed Monday to longstanding policies and practices, adopted following abuses and mistakes that were uncovered during the Nixon administration’s Watergate scandal of the early 1970s. The Justice Department — of which the FBI is part — is supposed to refrain from sharing detailed information about its criminal investigations with the White House.

The FBI also looked into whether a separate set of emails between Petraeus and Broadwell might involve any security breach. That will be a key question Wednesday in meetings involving congressional intelligence committee leaders, FBI deputy director Sean Joyce and CIA deputy director Michael Morell.

A federal law enforcement official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss details of the investigation, said the FBI had concluded relatively quickly — and certainly by late summer at the latest — that there was no security breach. Absent a security breach, it was appropriate not to notify Congress or the White House earlier, this official said.

Extramarital affairs are viewed as particularly risky for intelligence officers because they might be blackmailed to keep the affair quiet. For military personnel, adultery is a crime under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

According to two federal law enforcement officials, the FBI initially began a criminal investigation of unsigned, harassing emails that were sent, beginning last May, to Kelley, a Tampa socialite. She and her husband, Scott, were longtime friends of Petraeus and his wife, Holly. FBI agents traced the alleged cyber harassment to Broadwell and during that process discovered she was exchanging intimate messages with a private Gmail account. Further investigation revealed that account belonged to Petraeus, under an alias.

Petraeus and Broadwell apparently used a trick, known to terrorists and teenagers alike, to conceal their email traffic, one of the law enforcement officials said.

Rather than transmitting emails to the other’s inbox, they composed at least some messages and instead of transmitting them, left them in a draft folder or in an electronic “dropbox,” the official said. Then the other person could log onto the same account and read the draft emails there. This avoids creating an email trail that is easier for outsiders to intercept or trace.

Agents later told Petraeus that Broadwell sent emails warning Kelley to stay away from the general and carrying a threatening tone.

Friends and former staff members of Petraeus told The Associated Press that he has assured them his relationship with Kelley was platonic, although Broadwell apparently saw her as a romantic rival. They said Petraeus was shocked to learn last summer of Broadwell’s emails to Kelley.

Petraeus also denied to these associates that he had given Broadwell any sensitive military information.

FBI agents who contacted Petraeus told him that sensitive, possibly classified documents related to Afghanistan were found on her computer, the general’s associates said. He assured investigators they did not come from him, and he mused to his associates that they were probably given to her on her reporting trips to Afghanistan by commanders she visited in the field there.

One associate also said Petraeus believes the documents described past operations and had already been declassified, although they might have still been marked “secret.”

Broadwell had high security clearances as part of her former job as a reserve Army major in military intelligence. But those clearances are only in effect when a soldier is on active duty, which she was not at the time she researched the Petraeus biography.

The FBI concluded there was no security breach.

Nevertheless, FBI agents conducted a search of Broadwell’s Charlotte, N.C., home on Monday. And the criminal investigation continued into the emails to Kelley, including whether Petraeus had any hand in them. At that point in late summer, FBI Director Robert Mueller and eventually Attorney General Eric Holder were notified that agents had uncovered what appeared to be an extramarital affair involving Petraeus.

Broadwell and Petraeus have each been questioned by FBI agents twice in recent weeks, with both acknowledging the affair in separate interviews. The FBI’s most recent interviews with Broadwell and with Petraeus both occurred during the week of Oct. 29, days before the election, one of the law enforcement officials said. The FBI notified Obama’s director of national intelligence, James Clapper, of the investigation on Tuesday, Nov. 6 — Election Day.

In another twist, an FBI agent who was a friend of Kelley and who passed along information from her to the agents who conducted the investigation, was subsequently told by his superiors to steer clear of the case because they grew concerned that the agent had become obsessed with the investigation, a federal law enforcement official said. Before the case involving Petraeus got under way, the agent had sent Kelley shirtless photos of himself, according to this official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the investigation.

Broadwell co-authored a biography titled “All In: The Education of General David Petraeus,” published in January. She wrote that she met Petraeus in the spring of 2006 while she was a graduate student at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and she ended up following him on multiple trips to Afghanistan as part of her research.

Petraeus, 60, told one former associate he began an affair with Broadwell, 40, a couple of months after he became CIA director in September 2011. They mutually agreed to end the affair four months ago, but they kept in contact because she was still writing a dissertation on his time commanding U.S. troops overseas, the associate said.

Petraeus told former staffers and friends that he had regularly visited the Kelleys’ home overlooking Tampa Bay. Kelley, 37, served as a sort of social ambassador for U.S. Central Command, hosting parties for the general when Petraeus was commander there from 2008-10.

Jill Kelley regularly kept in touch with Petraeus when he became commander of the Afghanistan war effort, the two exchanging near-daily emails and instant messages, two of his former staffers said. But those messages were exchanged in accounts that his aides monitored as part of their duties and were not romantic in tone, the staffers said.

Petraeus and his family are devastated over the affair — especially Mrs. Petraeus, who “is not exactly pleased right now” after 38 years of marriage, said Steve Boylan, a friend and former Petraeus spokesman who spoke to him over the weekend.

Broadwell, married with two young sons, has not returned phone calls or emails seeking comment.

`` We are on track to build 450 to 500 miles of new wall by the end of 2020 , '' he told reporters . Behind him , steel panels atop a concrete levee wall , 30 feet in all , are rising from the sugar cane fields and bird sanctuaries of the valley — which is really a river delta . They are the first section of new border wall built under President Trump where there was no barrier before .
But that swaggering Washington confidence is not shared down on the border . Asked about Trump 's Election Day deadline , Carmen Qualia , an assistant chief with the Border Patrol , acknowledged it 's slow going .
`` [ Trump ] said , 'Hey , here 's my deadline , here 's what I need you to do . ' So we 're gon na continue to work towards meeting that deadline , '' said Qualia , who is in charge of the Rio Grande Valley wall team . `` And we 're either going to make it or not . ''
Trump gets an additional $ 1.4 billion toward his massive wall along the 2,000-mile southwest border under a government spending bill he is expected to sign . But in Texas , there 's widespread skepticism the president will have anywhere near the 450 miles of wall he wants by next December . Construction has already fallen behind schedule because of how difficult it is to take private land .
One contract reviewed by NPR , called RGV10 , says construction is n't expected to begin on certain wall segments until March 2021 — well after the election .
`` If you do n't have 12 months to acquire property , you 're cutting it way too short , '' said Hyla Head , a former real estate specialist with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers who spearheaded land acquisition for the first phase of wall-building under President George W. Bush in 2008 .
Customs and Border Protection , which is part of Homeland Security , does n't yet own most of the land where it plans to build the wall . In fact , Wolf 's photo op was staged on a half-mile section of the levee that was only recently acquired by the federal government . Hidalgo County land records show that much of the property needed to complete that stretch of wall is still in private hands .
Disorderly property records , complications with landowners and a cumbersome condemnation process have slowed progress to a snail 's pace . That 's despite an army of federal land specialists trying to rush the process to please the president .
Consider this : The government plans to erect 110 miles of the total 450 miles of barriers in the Rio Grande Valley . But as of last week , the feds still needed to acquire about 90 miles from private landowners . In fact , since January 2017 the administration has only taken three miles from private owners in the Rio Grande Valley , according to a CBP spokesperson .
`` It 's a big project , '' Qualia said . `` We 're gon na continue to do what we can to make it happen . ''
But she says agents want the tall wall , along with floodlights , sensors , cameras and a 150-foot-wide enforcement zone to combat drug and human trafficking .
`` We 've been asking for these tools , this technology ... the roads , '' Qualia said . `` And if it takes longer , it takes longer . ''
Most of the borderlands in Texas are privately owned , unlike states to the west where a strip along the border is mostly federal property .
`` Every project that has real estate acquisition is prevented from making faster progress , '' said a senior manager with detailed knowledge of wall building in the Rio Grande Valley who is not authorized to speak publicly .
Under eminent domain , the government can take private property for public use , but it has to pay for it . And that process is laborious and legalistic .
`` Federal entities that acquire property have a process , '' said Head . `` You may not like it , but this is tried and true . We have laws to protect property owners . ''
Roy Brandys , an eminent domain lawyer in Austin , Texas , has long experience representing border clients . Asked about completing the border wall in the valley by next December , he said , `` That would be a very aggressive schedule , very difficult to get accomplished just because of all the different issues that properties have . ''
Each step of the process is proving problematic . First , the government has to identify and make contact with each property owner .
In Starr County , at the western end of the Rio Grande Valley , the government is planning 52 miles of border wall . Ultimately , the administration will need to acquire acreage on hundreds of individual parcels . So far , the wall contractor has broken ground only in one unit owned by the U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service .
`` It 's very difficult to know who the rightful owners are . That 's the biggest challenge , '' said Rosalva Guerra , the chief appraiser of Starr County , where property records are notoriously incomplete .
In her tidy office , she pulls up a map on her computer screen that shows all the properties in the county . The map is awash with red , the color used to denote parcels where the county is unsure of the owner .
In Starr County , property has been handed down through many generations , some of it going back to land grants made by the King of Spain . Tracts are divided and subdivided between heirs , but Guerra says they rarely establish clear title .
`` So can you imagine the long list of heirs to partition that ? '' Guerra said . `` It 's a nightmare . Yeah , it 's just going to take a long time to be able to do that . I do n't think it 's going to happen by 2020 . ''
Yet a senior CBP official in Washington was not so pessimistic about the construction timetable . `` If [ landowners ] do n't voluntarily sell and we have to condemn the property , '' the official said , `` the judge can grant possession to the government nearly immediately after the declaration of taking and we can begin construction . ... We 're getting a lot of offers to sell down there . ''
Identifying the owner is only the first step . Then the government must request access to survey the land . So far , the Justice Department has had to sue nearly 50 property owners in the Rio Grande Valley just to get that access .
One of those defendants is Delfino Garza , an architect in Starr County . He did n't want government surveyors coming on his property outside Rio Grande City where he has a vineyard . As a sideline , he planted grapes a decade ago , clearing thick brush down by the Rio Grande for his vine rows .

defense,NPR Online News,1,http://www.npr.org/2013/02/20/172485828/how-should-the-u-s-respond-to-chinese-hacking,How Should The U.S. Respond To Chinese Hacking?,2013-02-20,Scott Neuman,"If the Chinese military is regularly hacking into the computers of U.S. organizations , as an American security firm says , it raises all sorts of questions about how the U.S. should respond .
Is this a job for the military or the intelligence agencies ? What role should diplomats and trade officials be playing ?
The report issued this week by the IT security consultancy Mandiant says it has traced the hacking activity to the People 's Liberation Army 's Unit 61398 , which has `` systematically stolen hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organizations . ''
As NPR 's Frank Langfitt reported , Unit 61398 is headquartered in a nondescript neighborhood in Shanghai 's sprawling Pudong district .
The Chinese government has strongly denied the report , but in the U.S. , there 's been a widespread belief for years that the Chinese have been deeply involved in computer hacking .
Speaking to The Associated Press , Shawn Henry , who now heads security firm CrowdStrike , used a military analogy to describe the current situation .
`` If the Chinese government flew planes into our airspace , our planes would escort them away , '' he said . `` If it happened two , three or four times , the president would be on the phone and there would be threats of retaliation . ''
Martin Libicki , a researcher at the RAND Corp. , says while there 's still no smoking gun , Beijing 's denials have reached the level of `` implausible deniability . '' Even so , he says the hacking can be viewed as essentially an illegal technology transfer .
`` How damaging that is to the United States depends on how much the problem is costing us , '' he says . `` It 's a policy decision on where you draw the line and why you want to draw the line , '' Libicki says .
It 's difficult to estimate the cost to the U.S. Broad figures have been tossed around , ranging from as much as a trillion dollars , which would be `` huge , '' Libicki says , to maybe a billion dollars , which would put it `` very low on the list of issues between the United States and China . ''
The allegation that the Chinese military may be playing a key role is a vestige of China 's evolving economic system in which the government still has a central role promoting industry , he says .
`` It may also be that a lot of the same techniques that it takes to steal secrets from Coca-Cola are the same techniques it takes to steal secrets from Lockheed , '' says Libicki . `` And Lockheed , of course , builds military equipment , the nature of which is probably of keen interest to the Chinese . ''
Richard Bejtlich , chief security officer at Mandiant , says the evidence in its report leaves little question about who is behind the spying .
`` It 's clear that this is not just a few people working in some basement , some patriotic hackers , '' he says . `` This is a military operation with defined goals , with schedules , with tasking . This is a whole new level of activity . ''
Bejtlich says the U.S. government is `` well aware '' of the activity , but partly because of concerns about exposing intelligence resources and other secrecy concerns , has been reluctant to talk about it .
Christopher Johnson , who holds the Freeman chair in China studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , says that while the Mandiant report may spur the Obama administration to action , the White House has been heading in that direction for some time .
`` It 's becoming so pervasive that there 's a sense that it 's time to do something about it , '' he says . `` One way or another , this [ Mandiant report ] puts tremendous salience on the issue and pressure on the U.S. government to do something about it . ''
Mandiant 's Bejtlich says at least some of the information China has garnered through its cybersleuthing program has military utility , and the report comes less than a month after the Pentagon announced it would dramatically expand its Cyber Command to defend against attacks and , if necessary , wage offensive operations .
And last week , the president issued an executive order to improve cybersecurity for critical infrastructure . He also even mentioned cybersecurity concerns in his State of the Union address last week .
Media reports in this country have linked the U.S. government to at least one high-profile cyberattack , the 2010 Stuxnet computer virus that hit networks associated with Iran 's nuclear facilities .
So far , there 's no evidence that China has done more than snoop , Bejtlich says . But he says it appears to be in a position to do much more .

If the Chinese military is regularly hacking into the computers of U.S. organizations, as an American security firm says, it raises all sorts of questions about how the U.S. should respond.

Is this a job for the military or the intelligence agencies? What role should diplomats and trade officials be playing?

The report issued this week by the IT security consultancy Mandiant says it has traced the hacking activity to the People's Liberation Army's Unit 61398, which has ""systematically stolen hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organizations.""

As NPR's Frank Langfitt reported, Unit 61398 is headquartered in a nondescript neighborhood in Shanghai's sprawling Pudong district.

The Chinese government has strongly denied the report, but in the U.S., there's been a widespread belief for years that the Chinese have been deeply involved in computer hacking.

Speaking to The Associated Press, Shawn Henry, who now heads security firm CrowdStrike, used a military analogy to describe the current situation.

""If the Chinese government flew planes into our airspace, our planes would escort them away,"" he said. ""If it happened two, three or four times, the president would be on the phone and there would be threats of retaliation.""

Mounting Evidence

Martin Libicki, a researcher at the RAND Corp., says while there's still no smoking gun, Beijing's denials have reached the level of ""implausible deniability."" Even so, he says the hacking can be viewed as essentially an illegal technology transfer.

""How damaging that is to the United States depends on how much the problem is costing us,"" he says. ""It's a policy decision on where you draw the line and why you want to draw the line,"" Libicki says.

It's difficult to estimate the cost to the U.S. Broad figures have been tossed around, ranging from as much as a trillion dollars, which would be ""huge,"" Libicki says, to maybe a billion dollars, which would put it ""very low on the list of issues between the United States and China.""

The allegation that the Chinese military may be playing a key role is a vestige of China's evolving economic system in which the government still has a central role promoting industry, he says.

""It may also be that a lot of the same techniques that it takes to steal secrets from Coca-Cola are the same techniques it takes to steal secrets from Lockheed,"" says Libicki. ""And Lockheed, of course, builds military equipment, the nature of which is probably of keen interest to the Chinese.""

A Well-Organized Operation

Richard Bejtlich, chief security officer at Mandiant, says the evidence in its report leaves little question about who is behind the spying.

""It's clear that this is not just a few people working in some basement, some patriotic hackers,"" he says. ""This is a military operation with defined goals, with schedules, with tasking. This is a whole new level of activity.""

Bejtlich says the U.S. government is ""well aware"" of the activity, but partly because of concerns about exposing intelligence resources and other secrecy concerns, has been reluctant to talk about it.

Christopher Johnson, who holds the Freeman chair in China studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says that while the Mandiant report may spur the Obama administration to action, the White House has been heading in that direction for some time.

""It's becoming so pervasive that there's a sense that it's time to do something about it,"" he says. ""One way or another, this [Mandiant report] puts tremendous salience on the issue and pressure on the U.S. government to do something about it.""

President And Pentagon Address Concerns

Mandiant's Bejtlich says at least some of the information China has garnered through its cybersleuthing program has military utility, and the report comes less than a month after the Pentagon announced it would dramatically expand its Cyber Command to defend against attacks and, if necessary, wage offensive operations.

And last week, the president issued an executive order to improve cybersecurity for critical infrastructure. He also even mentioned cybersecurity concerns in his State of the Union address last week.

Media reports in this country have linked the U.S. government to at least one high-profile cyberattack, the 2010 Stuxnet computer virus that hit networks associated with Iran's nuclear facilities.

So far, there's no evidence that China has done more than snoop, Bejtlich says. But he says it appears to be in a position to do much more.

""By virtue of having access they could just as easily delete information,"" he says. ""So this is an espionage problem now, but if they so decided to hold our assets at risk, they could choose to start destroying data, as we saw in Saudi Aramco last year.""

Some analysts say there is a key difference between the Cold War cloak-and-dagger between Washington and Moscow, and the current situation with Chinese spying.

""In the Cold War, the United States had a distinct advantage in the Soviet Union doing worse, and they had a distinct advantage in the United States doing worse,"" Libicki says. ""This is not true with the U.S. and China — we both have an interest in each other's economy doing better.""

Although the U.S. has offensive cyberwarfare capabilities, Libicki doesn't see the Pentagon and the U.S. intelligence community engaging in economic espionage on behalf of U.S. companies.

""If, for instance, we were able to take in information on Chery automobiles, a Chinese car company, who do we give it to? It turns out that to give it to GM and not Ford would not only look bad, but would probably set us up for lawsuits,"" he says.

And, as Johnson of the Center for Strategic and International Studies points out, there is an implied red line between economic espionage against U.S. companies and a cyberattack aimed at larger economic interests.

""In areas like key infrastructure, such as pipelines and power grids, I think even probing is out of bounds,"" he says. ""That's a message that we have been sending and presumably will continue to be sending to the Chinese and other governments.""",www.npr.org,center,UF4UaFg4w5o5TWBF

But on Saturday, the White House threw some cold water on that hypothesis, claiming that they made only minor adjustments to the talking points with which they prepped Susan Rice prior to her now-infamous round of Sunday talk show appearances, in which she stuck to the narrative of spontaneous protests sparked by outrage over a video.

Today is the 11th anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks. Bin Laden is dead. Al Qaeda hasn’t had a successful attack on Americans for years. President Obama has declared the War on Terror over. So why do most Americans have a nagging sense that it’s not over?

Why do we still go through a striptease every time we board a plane, or shuffle through metal detectors when we enter public buildings? Why do officials tell us we should immediately report to the police we when notice an unclaimed backpack or piece of luggage? If the War on Terror is over, why can’t we go back to the way things were before September 11th?

Because the War on Terror isn’t over, not really. Yes, the Iraq War might be over, and the Afghan War has a termination date in sight, but there is still a terrorist threat looming over us. And we’re not comfortable with it. We don’t like unfinished business, or ambiguity, and the War on Terror still feels like both.



The world laughs at Americans for having a notoriously short attention span. Our women don’t like last year’s fashions, our men don’t like last year’s car models, and our children certainly don’t like last year’s music. Americans thrive on reinvention. We’re the same way with wars; we have no patience for long wars, whether it’s the War on Poverty, or the War on Drugs, or the War on Terror. We’re not very good at long term, low- grade chronic problems. We’re terrific at dealing with acute crises, and that’s how we like our wars. We prefer wars which have a beginning, and middle and a victorious end.



When we’re in a war we focus all our national attention on it, and when it’s over and we’ve won, we go on to resume our old lives or, even better, remake new ones. For us, war is an abnormal state of affairs, which interrupts the peace. It’s an acute crisis that summons all our national energy to defeat it. After the Civil War, or World War I, or World War II, Americans launched new industries, created new social rules, invented new opportunities. We don’t dwell in the past, and we don’t hold grudges, either. Ten years after the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, we signed a mutual defense treaty with Japan. Twenty years later we were each other’s major trading partners.

[pullquote]



But this time, with the War on Terror, things are different. We still commemorate September 11. We did on the tenth anniversary, and we’ll do it today on the eleventh anniversary. Compare that to World War II. FDR called the attack on Pearl Harbor a day that would live on in ""infamy,"" but by that tenth anniversary the Greatest Generation had put that war behind them and moved on.



Why can’t we move on this time? Because it doesn’t feel like this is a war that’s finished; while our enemies may be down, they’re not out.

Al Qaeda may be a shadow of its former self in Pakistan and Afghanistan, but it’s moved on and regenerated in Africa and the Middle East. Al Qaeda and other jihadists movements don’t see this conflict as something that has a beginning, a middle and an end. They don’t see war as something which is concluded with a peace agreement, when both sides lay down their arms and pick up their lives. They see war as the normal state of affairs. For them peace is just the period between wars, when the sides regroup to fight again. They see peace as the aberration, not war. When do they think peace comes? Only when they’ve annihilated their enemies.



And that’s why we still commemorate September 11. We realize that the War on Terror is unfinished business, despite what our political leaders tell us. And, as uncomfortable as it is to live with, it’s a war we must ultimately win. Our enemies see this as a fight to the finish. If it’s a fight they ultimately win, the world will enter a prolonged era of darkness. It will be a new dark ages with genocide, tribe against tribe, religion against religion, race against race, and fought with the most dangerous weapons in history.



That’s why it is imperative that we fix our economy, resume our traditional role in the world and once more lead from the front. America is the world’s one essential country. If we don’t lead, who will take our place and set the rules by which the international community is governed? Most likely it will be countries which do not share our values, love our freedom, or believe that man has the right to choose his own leaders. It will be countries which do not share our sense of fair play, or rush to aid victims of natural disaster, or believe in helping the less fortunate. Or even worse, no country will lead and the world will descend into chaos where there are no rules, where it's every nation or tribe for itself.

As acting secretary , Shanahan has been a contrast to Mattis , who challenged the White House on policy decisions ranging from the use of torture to allowing transgender service members to remain on duty to keeping U.S. troops in Syria .
Trump used to note approvingly that Mattis ' nickname was `` Mad Dog . '' But over time their relationship cooled . In a 2018 interview , Trump even said Mattis was `` sort of a Democrat . ''

They add that Shanahan was more involved in weapons systems and projects , almost like a project manager rather than a No . 2 Pentagon official who must step back and see the big picture .
At a recent hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee to discuss the administration 's proposed Pentagon budget , Shanahan seemed most comfortable talking about the way ahead for military programs , focusing on how the Pentagon will counter the growing military power of China and Russia .
`` China 's defense spending approaches that of the United States , when we take into account purchasing power and the portion of our budget going to military pay and benefits , '' Shanahan told senators .
`` That , coupled with China 's organized approach to steal foreign technology , has allowed China to modernize its missile , space and cyber capabilities , as well as project power far beyond its borders , '' he said . `` Russia , for its part , continues to compete asymmetrically with the United States , modernizing and developing its own missile , space and cyber capabilities .

The renewed violence came as Afghan President Hamid Karzai acknowledged at a news conference that regular payments his government has received from the CIA for more than a decade would continue . Karzai also said that talks on a U.S.-Afghan bilateral security agreement to govern future American military presence in the country had been delayed because of conditions the Afghans were placing on the deal .
The U.S.-led coalition reported that five international troops were killed by a roadside bomb in southern Afghanistan , and coalition spokesman Capt . Luca Carniel confirmed that all five were American .
The coalition did not disclose the location of the roadside bombing . However , Javeed Faisal , a spokesman for the governor of Kandahar province , said the coalition patrol hit the bomb in the Maiwand district of the province , the spiritual birthplace of the Taliban .
Later , the coalition reported that a soldier with the Afghan National Army turned his weapon on coalition troops in the west , killing two in the most recent of so-called insider attacks . Such attacks by members of the Afghan security forces against their fellow colleagues or international troops have eroded confidence in the Afghan forces as they work to take over from foreign forces .
Both killed were American , according to two U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose the nationalities ahead of an official announcement .
It was the fourth time since last summer that seven Americans have been killed on a single day in the war .
On March 12 , a Black Hawk helicopter crashed outside Kandahar , killing five U.S. troops . Two more U.S. troops were killed that day by an insider attack .
And on April 6 , Afghan militants killed six Americans , including a young female diplomat , and an Afghan doctor in a pair of attacks in southern Afghanistan . The three U.S. service members , two U.S. civilians and the doctor were killed when the group was struck by an explosion while traveling to donate books to a school . A seventh American , a civilian , was killed in a separate insurgent attack in the east .
On Aug. 16 , 2012 , seven American service members were killed in two attacks in Kandahar province . Six were killed when their helicopter was shot down by insurgents and one soldier died in a roadside bomb explosion .
At the news conference , Karzai said he had met earlier in the day with the Kabul station chief of the CIA and was reassured that the agency 's payments to the Afghan government would continue . The New York Times had reported that for more than a decade , the CIA had given the Afghan National Security Council tens of millions of dollars in monthly payments delivered in suitcases , backpacks and plastic shopping bags .
Karzai said he told the station chief : `` 'Because of all these rumors in the media , please do not cut all this money because we really need it . We want to continue this sort of assistance . ' And he promised that they are not going to cut this money . ''
Karzai described the payments as a form of `` government-to-government '' assistance , and while he would n't say how much the CIA gave to the National Directorate of Security , which is the Afghan intelligence service , he said the financial help was very useful . He claimed that much of the money was used to care for wounded employees of the NDS , Afghanistan 's intelligence service , and operational expenses .
`` We have spent it in different areas ( and ) solved lots of our problems , '' Karzai said .
He said the CIA payments were made in cash and that `` all the money which we have spent , receipts have been sent back to the intelligence service of the United States monthly . ''
During the news conference at the presidential palace , Karzai also discussed ongoing negotiations on a U.S.-Afghan bilateral security agreement . He said talks had been delayed because of certain conditions that Afghanistan was insisting be included in the pact , which will govern a U.S. military presence after 2014 when nearly all foreign combat troops are to have finished their withdrawal from Afghanistan . The talks , which started in late 2012 , are set to last up to a year .
President Barack Obama has not said how many troops will remain , although there have been estimates ranging from 8,000 to 12,000 . It is unlikely such an announcement will be made until the security agreement is signed . Those troops would help train Afghan forces and also carry out operations against al-Qaida and other militant groups .
Karzai said Afghanistan was ready to sign a deal as long as the American government in exchange for being able to stay on bases in the country agrees to terms of Afghan security , funding assistance and help with training and equipping Afghan security forces . It is thought that the contentious issue of providing U.S. troops immunity from Afghan law is a low priority for the Afghan government in the negotiations .
The Afghan government has not said how much rent it would want for three or four U.S. bases , but it is believed to be in the billions . Afghanistan is also thought to be seeking security guarantees to protect its porous borders , including the frontier with Pakistan that is the main infiltration route for insurgents who retain sanctuary in Pakistan 's lawless tribal areas .
It was unclear how Karzai expected the United States or any of its allies to guarantee Afghanistan 's borders against attack .","Patrick Quinn and Rahim Faiez, Associated Press

KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — Seven U.S. service members were killed on Saturday in one of the deadliest days for Americans in Afghanistan in recent months, as the Taliban continued attacks against foreign troops as part of their spring offensive.

The renewed violence came as Afghan President Hamid Karzai acknowledged at a news conference that regular payments his government has received from the CIA for more than a decade would continue. Karzai also said that talks on a U.S.-Afghan bilateral security agreement to govern future American military presence in the country had been delayed because of conditions the Afghans were placing on the deal.

Karzai said he told the station chief: ""'Because of all these rumors in the media, please do not cut all this money because we really need it. We want to continue this sort of assistance.' And he promised that they are not going to cut this money.""

Karzai described the payments as a form of ""government-to-government"" assistance, and while he wouldn't say how much the CIA gave to the National Directorate of Security, which is the Afghan intelligence service, he said the financial help was very useful. He claimed that much of the money was used to care for wounded employees of the NDS, Afghanistan's intelligence service, and operational expenses.

""We have spent it in different areas (and) solved lots of our problems,"" Karzai said.

He said the CIA payments were made in cash and that ""all the money which we have spent, receipts have been sent back to the intelligence service of the United States monthly.""

The CIA declined to comment on Saturday.

During the news conference at the presidential palace, Karzai also discussed ongoing negotiations on a U.S.-Afghan bilateral security agreement. He said talks had been delayed because of certain conditions that Afghanistan was insisting be included in the pact, which will govern a U.S. military presence after 2014 when nearly all foreign combat troops are to have finished their withdrawal from Afghanistan. The talks, which started in late 2012, are set to last up to a year.

President Barack Obama has not said how many troops will remain, although there have been estimates ranging from 8,000 to 12,000. It is unlikely such an announcement will be made until the security agreement is signed. Those troops would help train Afghan forces and also carry out operations against al-Qaida and other militant groups.

Karzai said Afghanistan was ready to sign a deal as long as the American government in exchange for being able to stay on bases in the country agrees to terms of Afghan security, funding assistance and help with training and equipping Afghan security forces. It is thought that the contentious issue of providing U.S. troops immunity from Afghan law is a low priority for the Afghan government in the negotiations.

The Afghan government has not said how much rent it would want for three or four U.S. bases, but it is believed to be in the billions. Afghanistan is also thought to be seeking security guarantees to protect its porous borders, including the frontier with Pakistan that is the main infiltration route for insurgents who retain sanctuary in Pakistan's lawless tribal areas.

It was unclear how Karzai expected the United States or any of its allies to guarantee Afghanistan's borders against attack.",www.usatoday.com,center,PEyLfsoqlxMPdkxx

The federal investigation into the attacks got off to a stupefyingly dreadful start , and three months later , justice and accountability remain in short supply :
Three months after Ambassador Christopher Stevens , a diplomat and two CIA contractors were murdered in Benghazi , there is no sign of the killers being brought to justice by the United States . The investigation into the attacks has been hampered by the reluctance of the Libyan authorities to move against the Islamist terrorists identified by the FBI as responsible for the killing , according to American officials briefing the 'New York Times ' . None of the suspects has been arrested or killed and some have fled Libya . Last month , the FBI issued a global appeal asking anyone with information about the killers to send information in an e-mail , text message or via Facebook . Stevens , the first U.S. ambassador to be killed in the line of duty since 1979 , diplomat Sean Smith and CIA contractors and former U.S. Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods , were killed in an attack on the U.S. consultate in Benghazi on September 11 . The following day , President Barack Obama vowed : 'Make no mistake , justice will be done . ' But that promise may remain unfulfilled if there is not more cooperation from the Libyan authorities .
The White House and its allies now insist that most questions on Benghazi have already been asked and answered -- a claim that even some members of the mainstream media are finding hard to swallow . Here 's a question : Is this report accurate ?
A source with personal knowledge of the security situation in Benghazi told Breitbart News that Senators who listened to closed door testimony about the Benghazi attack were shocked to learn State Department security personnel agents were not immediately armed .

Susan Rice stated that our security presence at the Benghazi mission was `` substantial . '' Does the president stand by those assessments ? If not , why were they made in the first place ?
( 3 ) Why were US security personnel pulled out of Libya , even as Amb . Stevens warned of heightened risks ?

defense,Politico,0,http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/ash-carter-push-back-114908.html?hp=lc2_4,Carter: I won't be pushed around,2015-02-04,Austin Wright,"Ash Carter says he ’ d be an independent voice if he ’ s confirmed as the next secretary of defense – and he showed it at his Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday .
President Barack Obama so far hasn ’ t armed Ukrainian government forces fighting Russian troops and separatists – but Carter told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he could support that .
The president wants to pull nearly all U.S. troops out of Afghanistan by the time he leaves office in early 2017 – but Carter said if the situation there deteriorates , he ’ d advocate putting on the brakes .
And Obama wants to release as many Guantanamo Bay detainees as possible in hopes of closing the U.S. military prison there – but Carter said he would not be a rubber stamp for releasing those who could pose a danger to the United States .
Carter would be Obama ’ s fourth secretary of defense , and the president does not want a fifth , so that could give Carter leverage on these and other issues inside the administration during its last two years .
The question is whether Carter would be able to overcome the problem that has plagued Obama ’ s other defense secretaries — military policy being run out of the White House and its National Security Council , rather than the Pentagon , leaving the secretary of defense out of the loop .
In hour after hour of his confirmation hearing Wednesday before the Armed Services Committee , Carter made clear that although he “ supports ” the president on many key areas , he ’ s not afraid to stake out his own position separate from the White House .
The administration has not supplied Ukraine ’ s government with weapons to defend itself from Russian troops and separatists , but Carter said he ’ d “ incline ” toward doing so .
The president has pushed a narrative that U.S. combat in Afghanistan ended on Dec. 31 , but Carter said the U.S. must “ continue its campaign and finish the job there. ” Obama wants the U.S. military to shrink to an embassy-only presence by the time he leaves office , but Carter said if the security situation in Afghanistan warrants it , he ’ d advise otherwise .
“ I understand we have a plan ; the president has a plan , ” Carter said . “ I support that plan . At the same time — it ’ s [ only ] a plan . If I ’ m concerned and I ascertain , as the years go by , we need to change that plan , I will recommend those changes to the president . ”
Those responses were music to the ears of Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain of Arizona and other Republican critics , who argue that Obama has set the stage for another Iraq-style implosion in Afghanistan by pulling American troops out before indigenous troops can handle security on their own .
Republicans are skeptical , however , that Carter ’ s views will count for much given what they call Obama ’ s track record of “ micromanagement . ”
“ I ’ m confident that he has no influence whatsoever , nor did his three predecessors , ” McCain told reporters during a break in the hearing . “ Because all of the decisions , we know , are made by three or four people and at the White House level , whether it be detainees or whether it be Ukraine or whether it be the Free Syrian Army , which all of the national security team leaders recommended and the president turned it down . ”
Asked whether Carter ’ s relationships with National Security Adviser Susan Rice and other top White House officials could help him , McCain said , “ It doesn ’ t matter . ”
Sen. Joe Manchin ( D-W.Va. ) pointed out to reporters that the defense secretary works for the president — a fact he encouraged his Republican colleagues to accept .
“ They have to understand — he ’ s going to be working for the White House and the president , ” Manchin said during the break . “ You ’ ve got to respect that . Just trying to beat him up is not my way of approaching these things . ”
Sen. Tim Kaine ( D-Va. ) said Carter ’ s long track record in the Pentagon — first as the top acquisition executive and then as deputy defense secretary — meant he was not concerned about his ability to make his mark inside the administration .
“ Anybody who knows Ash Carter well should not make that prediction , ” Kaine said . “ You saw the confidence he has , and you ’ re going to see a very strong vote for him . The reason he ’ s going to get a strong vote is people know that he will make a difference . ”
But Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-S.C. ) argued it doesn ’ t matter how strong a case Carter makes if the president isn ’ t interested .
“ That depends on what the president will allow him to do , ” Graham said . “ The commander in chief is going to have to adjust his policies . Dr. Carter could help him do that if he ’ ll listen . ”
On most major issues , however , Carter is in lockstep with Obama . He ’ s behind the strategy of fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant from the air while trying to train Iraqi and Syrian forces to fight on the ground . He echoed calls by senators in both parties to reform the way the Pentagon buys weapons and equipment , explaining that he understood better than anyone the frustrations of dealing with the department ’ s legendary waste , delays and red tape .
But there was no clear resolution in sight to a few outstanding disputes both within the administration — and between it and Congress .
Nearly everyone in Washington — Republican and Democrat — agrees that the automatic , across-the-board budget restrictions set to resume next fiscal year with the return of sequestration pose a danger to military readiness .
Despite that consensus , however , the sides disagree on how to undo it . Many Republicans want to spare the Pentagon but cut other parts of the federal budget . Many Democrats want increased spending on both sides , along with some tax increases .
Carter did not take a side during his daylong confirmation hearing , but did renew his warning about sequestration and made clear that he ’ d push both inside and outside the administration for the Pentagon to have as much support as possible .
“ If I ’ m secretary of defense , I would like to see more spending on defense , ” he said . “ I ’ m very open about that . ”
The outgoing defense secretary , Chuck Hagel , clashed behind the scenes with the White House on the defense budget , Syria and Russia — disputes that led him to resign . With those large-scale problems unresolved , members of Congress and the defense establishment will be watching closely as Carter tries his hand at them .
In fact , McCain and Graham pounced on Carter when he toed the administration line on the strategy for Syria .
“ How in the world are we going to dislodge ISIL from Syria without a ground component ? ” Graham asked . Military forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad will destroy the U.S.-backed “ moderate ” opposition that American troops plan to begin training in Qatar , Turkey and Saudi Arabia , he said — unless the U.S. commits to a larger intervention that defangs Assad ’ s air force and gives the “ moderate ” troops a fighting chance .
Carter said the situation is “ complex ” and that Washington believes Assad ’ s eventual removal from power “ has got to be at the end of the road . ”
Republicans , though , appeared to like what they heard from Carter on the subject of releasing detainees from the U.S. military prison at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba . One reason for the break between Obama and his departing defense secretary was what White House officials called slow-walking by Hagel on signing off on the release of those prisoners .
Sen. Kelly Ayotte ( R-N.H. ) said she hopes Carter does not become a rubber stamp for releasing prisoners who could become dangerous to the U.S .
“ I would ask you , Secretary Carter — or soon-to-be Secretary Carter — to make a commitment to this committee that you will not succumb to any pressure by this administration to increase the pace of transfer from Guantánamo . ”

President Barack Obama so far hasn’t armed Ukrainian government forces fighting Russian troops and separatists – but Carter told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he could support that.

Story Continued Below

The president wants to pull nearly all U.S. troops out of Afghanistan by the time he leaves office in early 2017 – but Carter said if the situation there deteriorates, he’d advocate putting on the brakes.

And Obama wants to release as many Guantanamo Bay detainees as possible in hopes of closing the U.S. military prison there – but Carter said he would not be a rubber stamp for releasing those who could pose a danger to the United States.

Carter would be Obama’s fourth secretary of defense, and the president does not want a fifth, so that could give Carter leverage on these and other issues inside the administration during its last two years.

The question is whether Carter would be able to overcome the problem that has plagued Obama’s other defense secretaries — military policy being run out of the White House and its National Security Council, rather than the Pentagon, leaving the secretary of defense out of the loop.

In hour after hour of his confirmation hearing Wednesday before the Armed Services Committee, Carter made clear that although he “supports” the president on many key areas, he’s not afraid to stake out his own position separate from the White House.

The administration has not supplied Ukraine’s government with weapons to defend itself from Russian troops and separatists, but Carter said he’d “incline” toward doing so.

The president has pushed a narrative that U.S. combat in Afghanistan ended on Dec. 31, but Carter said the U.S. must “continue its campaign and finish the job there.” Obama wants the U.S. military to shrink to an embassy-only presence by the time he leaves office, but Carter said if the security situation in Afghanistan warrants it, he’d advise otherwise.

“I understand we have a plan; the president has a plan,” Carter said. “I support that plan. At the same time — it’s [only] a plan. If I’m concerned and I ascertain, as the years go by, we need to change that plan, I will recommend those changes to the president.”

Those responses were music to the ears of Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain of Arizona and other Republican critics, who argue that Obama has set the stage for another Iraq-style implosion in Afghanistan by pulling American troops out before indigenous troops can handle security on their own.

Republicans are skeptical, however, that Carter’s views will count for much given what they call Obama’s track record of “micromanagement.”

“I’m confident that he has no influence whatsoever, nor did his three predecessors,” McCain told reporters during a break in the hearing. “Because all of the decisions, we know, are made by three or four people and at the White House level, whether it be detainees or whether it be Ukraine or whether it be the Free Syrian Army, which all of the national security team leaders recommended and the president turned it down.”

Asked whether Carter’s relationships with National Security Adviser Susan Rice and other top White House officials could help him, McCain said, “It doesn’t matter.”

“It’s micromanagement from the White House,” he said.

Democrats, predictably, dismissed the notion.

Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) pointed out to reporters that the defense secretary works for the president — a fact he encouraged his Republican colleagues to accept.

“They have to understand — he’s going to be working for the White House and the president,” Manchin said during the break. “You’ve got to respect that. Just trying to beat him up is not my way of approaching these things.”

Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said Carter’s long track record in the Pentagon — first as the top acquisition executive and then as deputy defense secretary — meant he was not concerned about his ability to make his mark inside the administration.

“Anybody who knows Ash Carter well should not make that prediction,” Kaine said. “You saw the confidence he has, and you’re going to see a very strong vote for him. The reason he’s going to get a strong vote is people know that he will make a difference.”

But Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) argued it doesn’t matter how strong a case Carter makes if the president isn’t interested.

“That depends on what the president will allow him to do,” Graham said. “The commander in chief is going to have to adjust his policies. Dr. Carter could help him do that if he’ll listen.”

On most major issues, however, Carter is in lockstep with Obama. He’s behind the strategy of fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant from the air while trying to train Iraqi and Syrian forces to fight on the ground. He echoed calls by senators in both parties to reform the way the Pentagon buys weapons and equipment, explaining that he understood better than anyone the frustrations of dealing with the department’s legendary waste, delays and red tape.

But there was no clear resolution in sight to a few outstanding disputes both within the administration — and between it and Congress.

Nearly everyone in Washington — Republican and Democrat — agrees that the automatic, across-the-board budget restrictions set to resume next fiscal year with the return of sequestration pose a danger to military readiness.

Despite that consensus, however, the sides disagree on how to undo it. Many Republicans want to spare the Pentagon but cut other parts of the federal budget. Many Democrats want increased spending on both sides, along with some tax increases.

Carter did not take a side during his daylong confirmation hearing, but did renew his warning about sequestration and made clear that he’d push both inside and outside the administration for the Pentagon to have as much support as possible.

“If I’m secretary of defense, I would like to see more spending on defense,” he said. “I’m very open about that.”

The outgoing defense secretary, Chuck Hagel, clashed behind the scenes with the White House on the defense budget, Syria and Russia — disputes that led him to resign. With those large-scale problems unresolved, members of Congress and the defense establishment will be watching closely as Carter tries his hand at them.

In fact, McCain and Graham pounced on Carter when he toed the administration line on the strategy for Syria.

“How in the world are we going to dislodge ISIL from Syria without a ground component?” Graham asked. Military forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad will destroy the U.S.-backed “moderate” opposition that American troops plan to begin training in Qatar, Turkey and Saudi Arabia, he said — unless the U.S. commits to a larger intervention that defangs Assad’s air force and gives the “moderate” troops a fighting chance.

Carter said the situation is “complex” and that Washington believes Assad’s eventual removal from power “has got to be at the end of the road.”

McCain called Obama’s strategy for Syria “idiocy” and “nonsense.”

Republicans, though, appeared to like what they heard from Carter on the subject of releasing detainees from the U.S. military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. One reason for the break between Obama and his departing defense secretary was what White House officials called slow-walking by Hagel on signing off on the release of those prisoners.

Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) said she hopes Carter does not become a rubber stamp for releasing prisoners who could become dangerous to the U.S.

“I would ask you, Secretary Carter — or soon-to-be Secretary Carter — to make a commitment to this committee that you will not succumb to any pressure by this administration to increase the pace of transfer from Guantánamo.”

Carter said he agreed.

Ayotte also asked Carter to pledge that he would not allow the release of anyone he believed could once again become a terrorist threat to the U.S., as many as some 184 former prisoners may have.

U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter arrived in Baghdad on an unannounced visit Saturday, hoping to push Iraq to allow Turkey to play a role in the battle against the Islamic State for Mosul, but Iraq’s prime minister said no thanks.

Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said through a translator that Iraqi, Kurdish and other local forces can handle the battle for the country's second-largest city themselves.

“I know that the Turks want to participate, we tell them thank you, this is something the Iraqis will handle and the Iraqis will liberate Mosul and the rest of the territories,” al-Abadi said.

Iraqi forces in coalition with Kurdish peshmerga soldiers, American advisers and various ethnic minority paramilitary units began a large-scale offensive Monday to recapture Mosul, which was overrun by Islamic State militants in 2014.

While recognizing Iraq's sovereignty is key, the U.S. goal is to resolve disputes between partners in the coalition in order to fight the common enemy, Carter said, according to the Associated Press.

“I am confident that we can plan a constructive role there,” he told reporters.

Carter's visit comes two days after a U.S. service member, who worked with Iraqi special forces as an explosives-disposal specialist, was killed outside Mosul, the fourth death since the U.S. began military operations in the region in August 2014, AP reported.

Meanwhile, Brig. Gen. Khattab Omer of the Kirkuk police, said Saturday that 80 people were killed in an apparent counter-attack a day earlier by suspected Islamic State fighters who stormed an Iranian-run power plant and police stations in the oil city of Kirkuk on Friday. The attack occurred as Iraqi forces advanced on militant-held Mosul about 100 miles to the northwest.

Most of those killed in the assault were Kurdish security forces. Another 170 were wounded, Omer said. Kurdish security forces recovered the bodies of 56 militants who took part in the attack, and a sundown curfew has been imposed on the city, he added.

The assault was the result of a terrorist attack and not a military breach, al-Abadi said.

“Nearly all the terrorists who entered Kirkuk have been eliminated, and we have full control, except for maybe one area where they are being flushed out,” he said after meeting with Carter.

In another development, hundreds were being treated for breathing problems from a burning sulfur plant set ablaze Thursday in Mishraq, south of Mosul. Residents were coughing and suffering from headaches and nosebleeds from the gray smoke.

Mahmoud Osman, a medical assistant at an emergency hospital, told AP that 250 people were treated for breathing difficulties Friday because of the smoke. The hospital ran out of hydrocortisone and oxygen supplies for the patients, who were mostly children or elderly, he said.

“It is causing suffocation among the children and it gives them nosebleeds,"" said Alaa Abdullah Khaled, a resident in the nearby village of Awsaja, told AP.

On Wednesday, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee said the president’s war strategy in Iraq is failing.

Rep. Howard P. “Buck” McKeon, California Republican, said Mr. Obama needs to consider new options — including American ground troops — for the air war-only strategy.

“Evidence is mounting that an ‘Iraq first’ approach focused on airstrikes isn’t degrading ISIL,” said Mr. McKeon, using one of the Islamic State’s acronyms, which is also known as ISIS. “From Kobani to Baghdad, they are using their Syrian sanctuary to make gains. The president needs to adopt a broader strategy if we are to protect our interests. He needs to walk out of the Pentagon willing to put new options on the table rather than continuing to rule them out.”

For more than a month, Mr. McKeon has advocated putting a relatively small number of U.S. ground troops into the battle to aid the beleaguered Iraqi Security Forces. Iraqi troops retreated en masse in June when the Islamic State invaded from Syria and gobbled up terrain.

The Washington Times reported Monday that the Islamic State today holds about the same number of towns in Iraq as it did two months ago, when the U.S. began a bombing campaign to whittle down the terrorist army and support Iraqi ground troops trying to retake territory.

More troubling, analysts say, is that the Islamic State apparently is preparing operations designed to one day invade Baghdad.

Its objective is to take the international airport and begin conquering the capital, section by section. The Islamic State is continuing its urban attacks with car bombs, some of which have been detonated by foreign suicide bombers.

Much press coverage on the war has focused in recent days on Kobani, where Kurdish fighters are in fierce street battles with Islamic State fighters as U.S. planes drop a smattering of bombs.

“We don’t have a willing, capable, effective partner on the ground inside Syria on the ground,” said Adm. Kirby. “It’s just a fact. I can’t change that.”

The U.S. strategy for “degrading and ultimately destroy[ing]” the Islamic State hinges on forming a new 5,000-strong Syrian fighting force in Saudi Arabia and then inserting it next spring inside Syria to fight the terrorist army. The Obama administration hopes this force, and continued airstrikes, will then evict the Islamic State town by town.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest echoed the Pentagon’s warning on Kobani — from where more than 160,000 Syrians have fled — and other towns.

“That will limit the effectiveness of the United States military on the situation in Kobani,” Mr. Earnest said. “That sort of ground operation doesn’t currently exist in Syria right now. We should just be forthright about the limitations in this particular situation.”

The president has vowed not to send U.S. combat ground troops into the fight against the Islamic State.

On Wednesday, U.S. airstrikes appeared to slow the Islamic State’s advance on Kobani, where Kurdish fighters have held off the militants during a three-week siege.

With the Islamic State closing in on the border, Turkey — a NATO ally — has refused to engage in combat against the militants, saying it needs assurances that the U.S.-led coalition of Western and Arab nations is committed to a long-term struggle. Turkey has fought off a Kurdish insurgency in southern regions since the 1980s.

On Thursday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, as well as Mr. Obama’s two envoys to the anti-Islamic State coalition — retired Gen. John Allen and Ambassador Brett McGurk — arrive for talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to push for greater Turkish action, The Associated Press reported.

Meanwhile, the Islamic State is not just advancing in Syria. After two months of U.S. bombing, the Sunni extremist army still holds as many, or more, towns than it did on Aug. 8.

Last week, it claimed a new city, Hit, in Iraq’s western Anbar province, a Sunni stronghold and gateway for possible attacks on the international airport and Baghdad.

The Obama administration is playing a waiting game. It has inserted special operations forces, not to fight but to help reorganize and train the reborn Iraqi Security Forces (ISF). As of now, it has not mounted anything close to a concerted counteroffensive.

Retired Army Lt. Gen. James Dubik, who led the effort to train and expand the ISF during the 2007 troop surge, said Iraq must go on the offensive soon.

“The longer we wait to get the ISF going on the ground portion of the counteroffensive, the more ISIS will adapt to air attack and find ways to keep the ISF occupied, and the harder it will be, psychologically, to get the ISF to transition to the offensive,” said Mr. Dubik, an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War. “Time is not on our side.”

He said the first phase can have “modest objectives,” such as targeting Islamic State leaders and taking back a few small towns.

“The ISF need a few important enough wins to move their psychology from ‘we’re under siege’ to ‘we’re on the move,’” he said.

Former Sen. Chuck Hagel took on critics at his Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday to become President Barack Obama 's next defense secretary , saying he may have been wrong at times in the past but always acted in the nation 's best interests .
Facing tough questioning from conservatives , the decorated Vietnam veteran told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he fully supported Obama administration policies on ending combat operations in Afghanistan next year , preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon , and ending the ban on gays openly serving in the military .

He also appeared evasive early on when confronted by some former Senate colleagues who challenged his nomination because of what they characterized as shifting positions on confronting Iran , supporting Israel and maintaining a strong military amid pressure to cut costs .
Later in the day , Hagel sounded more certain in responding to the repeated challenges by conservatives over what newly elected Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas called his record of `` antagonism '' toward Israel .
Despite the campaign against him waged by conservatives , Hagel was expected to win confirmation to succeed Leon Panetta as Pentagon chief .
Other prominent political figures endorsed him , including former Sen. Sam Nunn , a conservative Democrat from Georgia and respected defense and nuclear policy expert , and former Sen. John Warner , a conservative Republican from Virginia , where the Pentagon is located and key military installations are based .
In his opening statement and in response to questions , Hagel defended his 12-year record as a Republican senator from Nebraska and what he called a consistent worldview on the role of the United States and its unparalleled military might .
`` America has and must maintain the strongest military in the world ; that we must lead the international community to confront threats and challenges together ; and that we must use all tools of American power to protect our citizens and our interests , '' Hagel said , adding that the United States must engage the world .
Obama is reassembling his national security team at the start of his second term , turning to Vietnam War heroes for marquee positions : Hagel at defense and Sen. John Kerry to lead the State Department .
The next defense chief will wind down the war in Afghanistan and face fluid issues related to Iran and the civil war in Syria . Emerging terror hotspots in Africa and managing the Pentagon through budget uncertainty are other top priorities .
On specific issues at the hearing , Hagel said he was committed to Obama 's goal of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon .
`` I 've been on record on that issue . And as I 've said in the past many times , all options must be on the table to achieve that goal . My policy is one of prevention , and not one of containment -- and the president has made clear that is the policy of our government , '' he said .
Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin , D-Michigan , told Hagel that `` your reassurance to me in my office that you support the Obama administration 's strong stance against Iran is significant . ''
However , the panel 's top Republican , Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma , said he would oppose the nomination because of what he called Hagel 's past support for policies that he said would appease U.S. enemies .
In particular , Inhofe cited Hagel 's backing of direct talks with Iran , an enemy of Israel . Others challenged a Senate vote by Hagel years earlier to oppose unilateral U.S. sanctions against Iran , and a comment about the `` Jewish lobby '' in Washington that critics said hinted at anti-Israel sentiments .
Hagel , however , pledged continued support to help Israel 's military prowess in the region . In response to repeated questions about his commitment to Israel , Hagel cited his Senate record of voting for every aid authorization or other measure supporting Israel .
In addition , Hagel said the United States was `` not going to unilaterally disarm '' when questioned about his ties to a group calling for eliminating nuclear weapons . If confirmed , he said , he would maintain `` a modern , strong , safe , ready , and effective nuclear arsenal , '' adding that he was `` committed to modernizing '' it .
Regarding the possibility of impending budget cuts described by some as potentially devastating to Pentagon operations and the civilian economy it supports , Hagel said he would keep defense forces strong through efficient use of taxpayer dollars .
Asked later about the impact of the possible cuts , Hagel said that `` the security of this country is not going to be in jeopardy . '' But he added that `` if this happens , it 's going to be a severe problem . ''
The military faces $ 500 billion in automatic spending cuts over the next decade absent congressional intervention in coming months to avert or soften them . This would come on top of steep budget reductions already in the pipeline .
If confirmed , Hagel will be the first defense secretary to have served all of his military career as an enlisted soldier . He was an Army sergeant in Vietnam , where he was wounded , and said on Thursday that his war experience was an influence in his life .
`` I 'm not shaped , framed , molded , consumed by that experience , but it 's part of me , '' Hagel said , adding that he thought it would be a positive to have the defense secretary for the first time be someone `` who understands the reality and consequences of war . ''
A sharp exchange on Thursday came when Sen. John McCain criticized Hagel 's opposition to the troop surge in Iraq by the Bush administration and a similar move by Obama in Afghanistan . Both were crucial wartime decisions made by policymakers .
McCain , a former naval aviator and prisoner of war in Vietnam , said Hagel was wrong on both counts . The Arizona Republican said that he and Hagel , who once were close political allies and personal friends , had `` fundamental differences '' on important issues .
Hagel responded that his questioning of the surge strategy in Iraq was not an aberration .
`` I always ask the question is this going to be worth the sacrifice because there will be sacrifice , '' Hagel said . `` Now , was it required ? Was it necessary ? Senator McCain has his own opinion on that , shared by others . I am not sure . I am not that certain that it was required . It does n't mean I am right . ''
Other Republicans on the panel complained that Hagel failed to turn over requested copies of past speeches and financial reports they requested , and he avoided directly answering some questions seeking to force him to declare that previous positions or comments were mistaken .
Hammered during questioning by Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-South Carolina , Hagel conceded that he never should have made the comment about the Jewish lobby .
Hagel had three major preparatory sessions for Thursday 's hearing , according to an administration official involved in the confirmation process . The official said Hagel chose to `` take the high road '' by not responding with anger to `` political theater . ''
However , another official acknowledged Hagel had some difficulty , saying `` we think he 's on his way , but he did n't round the bases today . He could have . He did n't . ''
A plurality of Americans back Hagel 's nomination to succeed Panetta .
According to a CNN/ORC International poll conducted January 14-15 and released two weeks ago , 48 % of the public said the Senate should confirm Hagel , with 22 % saying no and three in 10 unsure .","Story highlights Hagel says he regrets some past comments; struggles at times under conservative pounding

In his opening statement and in response to questions, Hagel defended his 12-year record as a Republican senator from Nebraska and what he called a consistent worldview on the role of the United States and its unparalleled military might.

""America has and must maintain the strongest military in the world; that we must lead the international community to confront threats and challenges together; and that we must use all tools of American power to protect our citizens and our interests,"" Hagel said, adding that the United States must engage the world.

Obama is reassembling his national security team at the start of his second term, turning to Vietnam War heroes for marquee positions: Hagel at defense and Sen. John Kerry to lead the State Department.

The next defense chief will wind down the war in Afghanistan and face fluid issues related to Iran and the civil war in Syria. Emerging terror hotspots in Africa and managing the Pentagon through budget uncertainty are other top priorities.

On specific issues at the hearing, Hagel said he was committed to Obama's goal of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.

""I've been on record on that issue. And as I've said in the past many times, all options must be on the table to achieve that goal. My policy is one of prevention, and not one of containment -- and the president has made clear that is the policy of our government,"" he said.

Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin, D-Michigan, told Hagel that ""your reassurance to me in my office that you support the Obama administration's strong stance against Iran is significant.""

However, the panel's top Republican, Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, said he would oppose the nomination because of what he called Hagel's past support for policies that he said would appease U.S. enemies.

In particular, Inhofe cited Hagel's backing of direct talks with Iran, an enemy of Israel. Others challenged a Senate vote by Hagel years earlier to oppose unilateral U.S. sanctions against Iran, and a comment about the ""Jewish lobby"" in Washington that critics said hinted at anti-Israel sentiments.

Hagel, however, pledged continued support to help Israel's military prowess in the region. In response to repeated questions about his commitment to Israel, Hagel cited his Senate record of voting for every aid authorization or other measure supporting Israel.

""I think my record is pretty clear,"" he said.

In addition, Hagel said the United States was ""not going to unilaterally disarm"" when questioned about his ties to a group calling for eliminating nuclear weapons. If confirmed, he said, he would maintain ""a modern, strong, safe, ready, and effective nuclear arsenal,"" adding that he was ""committed to modernizing"" it.

Regarding the possibility of impending budget cuts described by some as potentially devastating to Pentagon operations and the civilian economy it supports, Hagel said he would keep defense forces strong through efficient use of taxpayer dollars.

Asked later about the impact of the possible cuts, Hagel said that ""the security of this country is not going to be in jeopardy."" But he added that ""if this happens, it's going to be a severe problem.""

The military faces $500 billion in automatic spending cuts over the next decade absent congressional intervention in coming months to avert or soften them. This would come on top of steep budget reductions already in the pipeline.

If confirmed, Hagel will be the first defense secretary to have served all of his military career as an enlisted soldier. He was an Army sergeant in Vietnam, where he was wounded, and said on Thursday that his war experience was an influence in his life.

""I'm not shaped, framed, molded, consumed by that experience, but it's part of me,"" Hagel said, adding that he thought it would be a positive to have the defense secretary for the first time be someone ""who understands the reality and consequences of war.""

A sharp exchange on Thursday came when Sen. John McCain criticized Hagel's opposition to the troop surge in Iraq by the Bush administration and a similar move by Obama in Afghanistan. Both were crucial wartime decisions made by policymakers.

McCain, a former naval aviator and prisoner of war in Vietnam, said Hagel was wrong on both counts. The Arizona Republican said that he and Hagel, who once were close political allies and personal friends, had ""fundamental differences"" on important issues.

Hagel responded that his questioning of the surge strategy in Iraq was not an aberration.

""I always ask the question is this going to be worth the sacrifice because there will be sacrifice,"" Hagel said. ""Now, was it required? Was it necessary? Senator McCain has his own opinion on that, shared by others. I am not sure. I am not that certain that it was required. It doesn't mean I am right.""

Other Republicans on the panel complained that Hagel failed to turn over requested copies of past speeches and financial reports they requested, and he avoided directly answering some questions seeking to force him to declare that previous positions or comments were mistaken.

Hammered during questioning by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, Hagel conceded that he never should have made the comment about the Jewish lobby.

Hagel had three major preparatory sessions for Thursday's hearing, according to an administration official involved in the confirmation process. The official said Hagel chose to ""take the high road"" by not responding with anger to ""political theater.""

However, another official acknowledged Hagel had some difficulty, saying ""we think he's on his way, but he didn't round the bases today. He could have. He didn't.""

A plurality of Americans back Hagel's nomination to succeed Panetta.

According to a CNN/ORC International poll conducted January 14-15 and released two weeks ago, 48% of the public said the Senate should confirm Hagel, with 22% saying no and three in 10 unsure.",www.cnn.com,left,5E4JujoPzXofvR77

Hagel announced his Pentagon budget priorities Monday afternoon . The Army had already been preparing to shrink to 490,000 active-duty members from a wartime peak of 570,000 . Hagel is proposing to cut it further to between 440,000 and 450,000 .
That would make it the smallest since just before the U.S. entered World War II .
`` We are repositioning to focus on the strategic challenges and opportunities that will define our future : new technologies , new centers of power , and a world that is growing more volatile , more unpredictable , and in some instances more threatening to the United States , '' Hagel said at a press conference at the Pentagon .
He defended the proposed reductions in troop strength , as a trade-off for building up `` technological superiority '' and priorities like Special Operations Forces and `` cyber resources . ''
Rep. Michael McCaul , R-Texas , chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee , warned that the cuts would hurt military readiness . And he said the country is only in this position because the Obama administration and Congress will not seriously take on cuts to entitlements .
`` It 's all being sacrificed ... on the altar of entitlements . This president can not take on mandatory spending , so all we 've done in the Congress -- and this president -- is basically cut discretionary spending , '' he told Fox News .
Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby , the Pentagon press secretary , said Monday that Hagel consulted closely with the military service chiefs on how to balance defense and budget-saving requirements . `` He has worked hard with the services to ensure that we continue to stand for the defense of our national interests -- that whatever budget priorities we establish , we do so in keeping with our defense strategy and with a strong commitment to the men and women in uniform and to their families , Kirby said .
`` But he has also said that we have to face the realities of our time . We must be pragmatic . We ca n't escape tough choices . He and the chiefs are willing to make those choices , '' Kirby said .
The New York Times first reported on the proposed cuts . The changes reportedly would leave the military capable of waging war , but unable to carry out protracted occupations of foreign territory , as in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Officials told the Times that Hagel 's plan has been endorsed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff . It calls for the Navy to maintain all 11 of its aircraft carriers currently in operation . However , the budget proposal mandates the elimination of the entire fleet of Air Force A-10 attack aircraft , as well as the retiring of the U-2 spy plane , a stalwart of Cold War operations .
The budget plan does keep money for the F-35 warplane , a project which has been beset by delays and criticism over design flaws .
Other characteristics of the budget will likely draw further ire from veterans groups and members of Congress . The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Hagel would recommend a limit on military pay raises , higher fees for health-care benefits , less generous housing allowances , and a one-year freeze on raises for top military brass .
`` This is a real uphill battle with Congress , '' Mieke Eoyang , director of the National Security Program at Third Way , a centrist think tank in Washington , told the Journal .
`` God bless [ Hagel ] for trying to get a handle on these costs , '' she said . `` But in this political environment , in an election year , it 's going to be hard for members of Congress to accept anything that 's viewed as taking benefits away from troops .

The FBI investigation began when someone reported suspicious emails allegedly sent from Broadwell . The agency then determined that she allegedly had emailed a number of government employees . The FBI was at one point trying to determine whether any of the employees were being stalked , sources told Fox News .
The FBI investigation started with a complaint several months ago about “ harassing ” e-mails from Broadwell to an unidentified third person , a government official briefed on the case told The New York Times on Saturday .

These sources tell Fox News that there is serious concern whether the chairman and ranking members of the committee were given appropriate notification by the FBI that Petraeus had surfaced within the scope of an investigation .

The move comes amid the unfolding controversy surrounding the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya . Scrutiny has fallen on a range of agencies including the CIA , and the director had been set to testify at hearings next week -- he is no longer expected to do so .

As in past years , thousands gathered at the World Trade Center site in New York , the Pentagon and Shanksville , Pa. , to read the names of nearly 3,000 victims killed in the worst terror attack in U.S. history . President Barack Obama was to attend the Pentagon memorial , and Vice President Joe Biden was to speak in Pennsylvania .
But many felt that last year ’ s 10th anniversary was an emotional turning point for public mourning of the attacks . For the first time , elected officials weren ’ t speaking at the ceremony , which often allowed them a solemn turn in the spotlight , but raised questions about the public and private Sept. 11 . Fewer families attended the ceremonies this year , and some cities canceled their remembrances altogether .
“ I feel much more relaxed ” this year , said Jane Pollicino , who came to ground zero Tuesday morning to remember her husband , who was killed at the trade center . “ After the ninth anniversary , that next day , you started building up to the 10th year . This feels a lot different , in that regard . It ’ s another anniversary that we can commemorate in a calmer way , without that 10-year pressure . ”
As bagpipes played at the year-old Sept. 11 memorial in New York , family clutching balloons , flowers and photos of their loved ones bowed their heads in silence at 8:46 a.m. , the moment that the first hijacked jetliner crashed into the trade center ’ s north tower , and again to mark the crashes into the second tower , the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field .
President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama observed the moment in a ceremony on the White House ’ s south lawn , and then laid a white floral wreath at the Pentagon , above a concrete slab that said “ Sept . 11 , 2001 — 937 am . ”
Victims ’ families in New York began the solemn , familiar ritual of tearfully reading the names of nearly 3,000 killed , with personal messages to their lost loved ones .
“ Rick , can you hear your name as the roll is called again ? On this sacred ground where your dust settled ? ” said Richard Blood , whose son , Richard Middleton Blood , Jr. , died in the trade center ’ s south tower . “ If only those who hear your name could know what a loving son and beautiful person you grew to be . I love you , son , and miss you terribly . ”
Thousands had attended the ceremony in New York in previous years , including last year ’ s milestone 10th anniversary . About 1,000 gathered by Tuesday morning , making paper rubbings of their loved ones ’ names etched onto the Sept. 11 memorial .
Commuters rushed out of the subway and fewer police barricades were in place than in past years in the lower Manhattan neighborhood surrounding ground zero . More than 4 million people have visited the memorial in the past year , becoming more of a public space than a closed-off construction site . On Tuesday , much of downtown Manhattan bustled like a regular weekday , except for clusters of police and emergency vehicles on the borders of the site .
Families had a mixed reaction to the changing ceremony , which kept politicians away from the microphone in New York for the first time . Charles G. Wolf , whose wife , Katherine , was killed at the trade center , said : “ We ’ ve gone past that deep , collective public grief. ” But Pollicino said it ’ s important that politicians still attend the ceremony .
“ There ’ s something missing if they ’ re not here at all , ” she said . “ Now , all of a sudden , it ’ s ‘ for the families. ’ This happened to our country — it didn ’ t happen only to me . ”
And Joe Torres , who put in 16-hour days in ground zero ’ s “ pit ” in the days after the attacks , cleaning up tons of debris , said another year has changed nothing for him .
“ The 11th year , for me , it ’ s the same as if it happened yesterday . It could be 50 years from now , and to me , it ’ ll be just as important as year one , or year five or year ten . ”
Political leaders still are welcome to attend the ground zero ceremony , and they are expected at the other commemorations , as well .
The Obamas planned later to visit wounded soldiers at Walter Reed Army Medical Center . The U.S. terror attacks were followed by wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , where the U.S. military death toll years ago surpassed the 9/11 victim count . At least 1,987 U.S. troops have died in Afghanistan and 4,475 in Iraq , according to the Pentagon .
Allied military forces marked the anniversary at a short ceremony at NATO ’ s headquarters in Kabul , Afghanistan with a tribute to more than 3,000 foreign troops killed in the decade-long war .
“ Eleven years on from that day there should be no doubt that our dedication to this commitment , that commitment that was seared into our souls that day so long ago , remains strong and unshaken , ” said Marine Gen. John Allen , the top commander of U.S. and coalition troops .
Scores gathered at the Flight 93 National Memorial in western Pennsylvania , where the fourth hijacked plane crashed into a Pennsylvania field . Biden and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar were to speak at the ceremony for the flight ’ s 40 victims .
Other ceremonies were held across the country — from New York ’ s Long Island , where hundreds wrote messages to their loved ones on a memorial , to Boston , where more than 200 people with ties to Massachusetts were remembered . But some cities scaled back — the suburb of Glen Rock , N.J. , where 11 people were killed , did not hold a memorial this year for the first time . Past events often ran for several hours , with speeches , music and the laying of roses in front of a granite memorial built with remnants of trade center steel .
“ It was appropriate for this year — not that the losses will ever be forgotten , ” said Brad Jordan , chairman of a community group that helps victims ’ families . “ But we felt it was right to shift the balance a bit from the observance of loss to a commemoration of how the community came together to heal . ”
The anniversary led to a brief pause in the presidential campaign as Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney pulled their negative ads and avoided campaign rallies . Romney shook hands with firefighters at Chicago ’ s O ’ Hare Airport and was flying to Nevada to address the National Guard , whose members deployed after the attacks . His running mate , Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin , had no scheduled public events .
The memorial foundation announced this summer that politicians wouldn ’ t be included this year , to separate politics from the ceremony . But others said keeping elected officials off the rostrum smacked of … politics . And several said they were unwilling to let go .
“ Coming here , it ’ s like ripping off a Band-Aid , ” said Yasmin Leon , whose sister was killed at the trade center . “ You rip it off and the wound is opened again . But you keep coming back anyway . ”
And at ground zero , family members reading their loved ones ’ names said the passage of time did not change their grief .
“ Mark , they say time heals all wounds . It ’ s not true , Mark , ” said Joanne Hindy , whose nephew died in the north tower . “ There ’ s a void in all our lives because this that will never ever be filled or healed . ”","NEW YORK — Americans paused again Tuesday to mark the 11th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks with familiar ceremony, but also a sense that it’s time to move forward after a decade of remembrance.

Thousands had attended the ceremony in New York in previous years, including last year’s milestone 10th anniversary. About 1,000 gathered by Tuesday morning, making paper rubbings of their loved ones’ names etched onto the Sept. 11 memorial.

Commuters rushed out of the subway and fewer police barricades were in place than in past years in the lower Manhattan neighborhood surrounding ground zero. More than 4 million people have visited the memorial in the past year, becoming more of a public space than a closed-off construction site. On Tuesday, much of downtown Manhattan bustled like a regular weekday, except for clusters of police and emergency vehicles on the borders of the site.

Families had a mixed reaction to the changing ceremony, which kept politicians away from the microphone in New York for the first time. Charles G. Wolf, whose wife, Katherine, was killed at the trade center, said: “We’ve gone past that deep, collective public grief.” But Pollicino said it’s important that politicians still attend the ceremony.

“There’s something missing if they’re not here at all,” she said. “Now, all of a sudden, it’s ‘for the families.’ This happened to our country — it didn’t happen only to me.”

And Joe Torres, who put in 16-hour days in ground zero’s “pit” in the days after the attacks, cleaning up tons of debris, said another year has changed nothing for him.

“The 11th year, for me, it’s the same as if it happened yesterday. It could be 50 years from now, and to me, it’ll be just as important as year one, or year five or year ten.”

Political leaders still are welcome to attend the ground zero ceremony, and they are expected at the other commemorations, as well.

The Obamas planned later to visit wounded soldiers at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. The U.S. terror attacks were followed by wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, where the U.S. military death toll years ago surpassed the 9/11 victim count. At least 1,987 U.S. troops have died in Afghanistan and 4,475 in Iraq, according to the Pentagon.

Allied military forces marked the anniversary at a short ceremony at NATO’s headquarters in Kabul, Afghanistan with a tribute to more than 3,000 foreign troops killed in the decade-long war.

“Eleven years on from that day there should be no doubt that our dedication to this commitment, that commitment that was seared into our souls that day so long ago, remains strong and unshaken,” said Marine Gen. John Allen, the top commander of U.S. and coalition troops.

Scores gathered at the Flight 93 National Memorial in western Pennsylvania, where the fourth hijacked plane crashed into a Pennsylvania field. Biden and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar were to speak at the ceremony for the flight’s 40 victims.

Other ceremonies were held across the country — from New York’s Long Island, where hundreds wrote messages to their loved ones on a memorial, to Boston, where more than 200 people with ties to Massachusetts were remembered. But some cities scaled back — the suburb of Glen Rock, N.J., where 11 people were killed, did not hold a memorial this year for the first time. Past events often ran for several hours, with speeches, music and the laying of roses in front of a granite memorial built with remnants of trade center steel.

“It was appropriate for this year — not that the losses will ever be forgotten,” said Brad Jordan, chairman of a community group that helps victims’ families. “But we felt it was right to shift the balance a bit from the observance of loss to a commemoration of how the community came together to heal.”

The anniversary led to a brief pause in the presidential campaign as Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney pulled their negative ads and avoided campaign rallies. Romney shook hands with firefighters at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport and was flying to Nevada to address the National Guard, whose members deployed after the attacks. His running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, had no scheduled public events.

The memorial foundation announced this summer that politicians wouldn’t be included this year, to separate politics from the ceremony. But others said keeping elected officials off the rostrum smacked of … politics. And several said they were unwilling to let go.

“Coming here, it’s like ripping off a Band-Aid,” said Yasmin Leon, whose sister was killed at the trade center. “You rip it off and the wound is opened again. But you keep coming back anyway.”

And at ground zero, family members reading their loved ones’ names said the passage of time did not change their grief.

“Mark, they say time heals all wounds. It’s not true, Mark,” said Joanne Hindy, whose nephew died in the north tower. “There’s a void in all our lives because this that will never ever be filled or healed.”

Obama MIA on military sex assault ?
President Barack Obama has no problem forcing changes at the Pentagon .
In five years , he ’ s drawn down the Iraq and Afghanistan wars , repealed “ don ’ t ask , don ’ t tell ” and given a green light to allow women to fight alongside men in combat .
But when it comes to the next big battle at the Defense Department — over sexual assault in the ranks — don ’ t expect Obama to lead the charge .
He hasn ’ t formally met with female Democrats who ’ ve made the issue a priority in Congress , despite repeated requests from one of them . He hasn ’ t endorsed any of their proposals . And his top aides have made no commitment to lawmakers and victims groups beyond pressuring military brass behind the scenes .
Obama could argue he ’ s still done more to stamp out sexual assault in the military than any other president , even raising the issue in front of military audiences .
“ No military unit can succeed without discipline , without trust and without cohesion , ” Obama told Marines at Camp Pendleton on Wednesday . “ And that ’ s why we ’ re going to work together , all of us , to stop these crimes of sexual assault and uphold the honor and the integrity that defines the finest military on Earth . And that message is coming all the way from the top . ”
But there ’ s little reason to think Obama will go beyond generic calls for change to take a clear stand on what he believes a serious overhaul should look like , even as the Senate debates competing proposals to tackle the very issue .
Members of his party aren ’ t expecting him to dive in since it would almost certainly cost Obama with military brass who have resisted significant changes for 25 years .
And Obama could even end up angering some Democrats since members of the party are divided on whether to remove prosecution of sexual assault cases from the chain of command or rely on the military hierarchy to enforce new policies .
“ I ’ ve never counted on the administration . I just think it ’ s something we ’ re working here , ” said Sen. Barbara Boxer ( D-Calif. ) , who is partnering with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ( D-N.Y. ) on legislation to remove prosecution of sexual assault cases from the military ’ s chain of command .
Rep. Mike Turner ( R-Ohio ) said Obama “ has been somewhat late to the game ” on the issue , which Turner has been trying to help solve for years . He nudged the White House to support what the House adopted in its version of the defense bill , including provisions that expand legal counsel for victims , establish mandatory minimum sentences for convicted sex offenders and eliminate a commander ’ s ability to overturn a jury verdict .
“ But I think people have not seen leadership out of the administration , ” Turner said . “ He wasn ’ t commenting on the issue until legislation had practically passed through the House . ”
So far , the White House hasn ’ t said whether Obama would support the chain of command measure or any of the other proposals senators are still debating .
“ We don ’ t comment on legislation at this point in the process , but as we ’ ve said , we are open to consideration of any ideas to improve prosecution , prevention and victim support , ” said White House spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden .
Sen. Chuck Grassley ( R-Iowa ) , who supports the command chain legislation , said he had his doubts Obama would step in during the critical moments of rounding up votes . “ If he does , he ’ ll do it at the last minute , ” Grassley said , adding that “ legislating is too messy for him . ”
Senate Armed Services Committee ranking member Jim Inhofe ( R-Okla. ) , an opponent of the Gillibrand-led approach , teased that if Obama did support the proposal , it could scare off some Republican supporters .
And Obama might not do much to flip Democrats either , according to Sen. Claire McCaskill , the Missouri Democrat who ’ s spearheading opposition to the Gillibrand bill . McCaskill supports an alternative package of reforms .
“ There ’ s very few Democrats that are undecided at this point . I don ’ t know if it would or not , if he weighed in , it would make a difference , ” McCaskill said . She added that she ’ d “ have a hard time imagining ” Obama would take a different stance than Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel , who initially expressed doubt about Gillibrand ’ s bill .
But still , some Democrats are hoping to get Obama on board . Gillibrand is trying to sway undecided senators on her chain of command proposal and has been working the West Wing ’ s back channels with phone calls to Valerie Jarrett and lunch with Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall , the White House ’ s defense policy coordinator . She is also asking for face time with the president to make her pitch to remove the command chain , the same way she ’ s been approaching fence-sitting senators on the floor and in their personal offices .
“ I ’ m doing everything in my power to make that happen . I ’ m going to marshal the evidence . I ’ m going to marshal the advocacy , ” the New York Democrat told ███ .
Rep. Jackie Speier ( D-Calif. ) , who like Gillibrand is advocating major changes in the military command ’ s oversight of prosecutions , said she ’ s been making personal pleas to Obama “ every time I ’ m around him. ” That included a brief moment with the president during picture time at the White House holiday party and when she handed him some papers about her legislation at the House Democratic retreat . She said she was also ready to bring the issue up during last week ’ s meeting in the Capitol with Obama .
“ I was too far up the line to be able to get my question in , ” she said .
Pressure is likewise building on Vice President Joe Biden to further challenge the Pentagon , with longtime allies noting the former Delaware senator ’ s own legislative résumé includes the original Violence Against Women Act in 1994 as well as its reauthorization earlier this year . “ I know he hates this kind of violence , ” said Eleanor Smeal , president of the Feminist Majority Foundation .
Senior White House aides including Tina Tchen , the chief of staff to Michelle Obama , and Lynn Rosenthal , the top adviser on violence against women and former executive director of the National Network to End Domestic Violence , have been heading up talks with lawmakers and victims groups . One recent session covered the transition for victims from military to civilian life and their struggles in getting health care .
Turner said he wasn ’ t impressed by a White House meeting in May that brought together 16 lawmakers who have been working on sexual assault matters — some for several years . “ It was almost as if our office was putting out a 101 briefing of what the issues were and what the various pieces of legislation would accomplish , ” he said .
Hagel , who has also been leading weekly meetings on sexual assault with senior Pentagon brass , is expected in the coming days to release six new policies on the issue , including an expansion of an advocacy program for victims to all military branches and recurring inspector general audits of all closed investigations , according to an internal memo of the draft plans obtained by ███ .
A senior White House aide also praised Hagel for his move earlier this year requesting legislation that would put a stop to commanders overturning jury verdicts . “ We thought that was a really great step and commitment to improving the system , ” said the White House official .
For his part , Obama warned in May that “ there is no silver bullet to solving this problem ” while urging Hagel to work on “ effective metrics and feedback loops ” that will help in understanding how much more needs to be done . The president said he wanted over the next several months and years to see a surge in victim reporting on sexual assault “ that may actually indicate to me that people are becoming more confident about moving forward . ”
“ On the other hand , I then want those trend lines to start going down because that indicates that we ’ re also starting to fix the problem and we ’ ve highlighted it , and people who are engaged in despicable behavior , they get fully punished for it , ” Obama said .
With so much media attention now focused on the issue , Kirby Dick , director of “ The Invisible War , ” an Oscar-nominated documentary about sexual assault in the military , said the White House meetings have afforded people like him a chance to pressure Obama ’ s team to step up now .
“ This is a real moment of opportunity . These moments do pass . Right now , there ’ s an outrage , ” said Dick , adding that he ’ s been to White House meetings in May and June “ to share our concerns and to discuss appropriate policy solutions . ”
“ Many of these assaults happened while he was commander in chief , ” Dick said . “ The Pentagon and DoD are all going to be judged on if this problem is really finally addressed . History is going to judge him on this . ”
The calls for Obama to speak up are coming from other quarters , too . In an op-ed piece picked up online by Fox News , The Daily Caller and The Hill , former Clinton White House lawyer Lanny Davis asked why Obama was missing in action on Gillibrand ’ s proposal , which has already notched the support of political opposites like Sens . Rand Paul ( R-Ky. ) and Ted Cruz ( R-Texas ) , a pair of 2016 hopefuls , and Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt. ) .
“ After all , this purple moment when Paul and Sanders agree on something doesn ’ t happen very often , ” Davis wrote . “ Obama should be ready to lead and support Gillibrand ’ s proposal , especially when the need for a perceived independent process for protecting victims of sexual assault seems so obvious and the downside so unclear . Maybe , just maybe , Obama can make this moment a precedent for more purple moments in Congress in the remainder of his term . ”
For Obama , speaking out on military sexual assault also creates potential legal questions .
A Navy judge in Hawaii ruled in June that two defendants on trial for sexual assault couldn ’ t be punitively discharged because of the president ’ s remarks a month earlier during a White House press conference in which he said : “ If we find out somebody is engaging in this stuff , they ’ ve got to be held accountable — prosecuted , stripped of their positions , court-martialed , fired , dishonorably discharged . Period . It ’ s not acceptable . ”
According to the judge ’ s ruling , Obama ’ s comments represented “ unlawful command influence ” by suggesting he had a specific punishment in mind for the perpetrators .
Other military judges have also cited the president ’ s comments in their opinions , and more than a dozen defense attorneys have been pointing to the remarks in their own cases .
“ If they don ’ t raise it as an issue , then it could be grounds for incompetence , ” said Thomas Romig , dean of the Washburn University School of Law in Topeka , Kan. , and a former Army judge advocate general .
Eugene Fidell , a military justice teacher at Yale Law School , said he would prefer to hear Obama speak up more frequently on sexual assault . But he said White House lawyers would be smart to advise the president to stay within some boundaries : stating his concerns and the need to keep women and men safe from these kinds of crimes .
“ Anything beyond that is simply asking for trouble , ” Fidell said .
Addressing the legal quagmire , Hagel weighed in Tuesday with a signed memo to senior Pentagon officials about the “ integrity of the military justice system ” that sought to downplay the reach of Obama ’ s remarks .
“ To be clear , each military justice case must be resolved on its own facts , ” Hagel wrote in the memo obtained by ███ . “ Those who exercise discretionary authority in the military justice process must exercise their independent judgment , consistent with applicable law and regulation . ”
“ The president was not being prescriptive in his comments . Rather , he was listing a range of examples of how offenders could be held accountable . The president expects all military personnel who are involved in any way in the military justice process to exercise their independent professional judgment . ”
Another problem for Obama — and one he ’ s got the power to control — is the image of who ’ s calling the shots on the issue . Consider the photos and video from the Senate Armed Services Committee ’ s June hearing on sexual assault in the military , where only one of the 12 lead witnesses from the Defense Department was a woman — the others were all older white males .
“ There ’ s no reason why the administration can ’ t and shouldn ’ t consider appointing women on par with their appointments of men , ” said Ana Cruz , a Tampa-based Democratic strategist who worked as Hillary Clinton ’ s Florida spokeswoman during the 2008 presidential campaign . She called on Obama to make it a point to hire more women to higher positions within the military , “ particularly when it comes to overseeing departments that deal with sexual harassment . ”
Several military veterans credited Obama with going as far as he can as the country ’ s top civilian leader .
“ That ’ s a tough one because I understand the corner he is in as the commander in chief . I don ’ t think that should preclude him from supporting policy that he might think is right , ” said Tom Tarantino , a former Army captain and policy associate at the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America .
Even if he doesn ’ t weigh in on Gillibrand ’ s bill , Obama ’ s efforts to date still represent an advance on the issue , given his main job is to make sure service members can do the jobs he gives them , said Greg Jacob , policy director at the Service Women ’ s Action Network .
“ In the past , it seems like the role of commander in chief , it ’ s been a lot easier to basically send troops out on missions than it is to deal with the day-to-day issue of their protection , their safety , ” he said .
Former Vermont Gov . Howard Dean said Obama ’ s been “ more out front than any president in history ” on the issue of sexual assault , noting the addition of more women into higher-profile roles at the Pentagon .
But Dean said the president could still do more , including endorsing the Gillibrand bill .
“ The military is a very big institution and it ’ s not going to change on its own . It needs some help from the outside , ” Dean said . “ Unless the president does what Harry Truman did regarding desegregation , it ’ s just going to take a very long time . ”","There’s little reason to think Obama will go beyond generic calls for change.

“To be clear, each military justice case must be resolved on its own facts,” Hagel wrote in the memo obtained by POLITICO. “Those who exercise discretionary authority in the military justice process must exercise their independent judgment, consistent with applicable law and regulation.”

White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler defended Obama’s comments.

“The president was not being prescriptive in his comments. Rather, he was listing a range of examples of how offenders could be held accountable. The president expects all military personnel who are involved in any way in the military justice process to exercise their independent professional judgment.”

Another problem for Obama — and one he’s got the power to control — is the image of who’s calling the shots on the issue. Consider the photos and video from the Senate Armed Services Committee’s June hearing on sexual assault in the military, where only one of the 12 lead witnesses from the Defense Department was a woman — the others were all older white males.

“There’s no reason why the administration can’t and shouldn’t consider appointing women on par with their appointments of men,” said Ana Cruz, a Tampa-based Democratic strategist who worked as Hillary Clinton’s Florida spokeswoman during the 2008 presidential campaign. She called on Obama to make it a point to hire more women to higher positions within the military, “particularly when it comes to overseeing departments that deal with sexual harassment.”

Several military veterans credited Obama with going as far as he can as the country’s top civilian leader.

“That’s a tough one because I understand the corner he is in as the commander in chief. I don’t think that should preclude him from supporting policy that he might think is right,” said Tom Tarantino, a former Army captain and policy associate at the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.

Even if he doesn’t weigh in on Gillibrand’s bill, Obama’s efforts to date still represent an advance on the issue, given his main job is to make sure service members can do the jobs he gives them, said Greg Jacob, policy director at the Service Women’s Action Network.

“In the past, it seems like the role of commander in chief, it’s been a lot easier to basically send troops out on missions than it is to deal with the day-to-day issue of their protection, their safety,” he said.

Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean said Obama’s been “more out front than any president in history” on the issue of sexual assault, noting the addition of more women into higher-profile roles at the Pentagon.

Wason did not identify the pilot by name or hometown , but he is among a legion of U.S. pilots now captaining jets for foreign airlines , said Kit Darby , an aviation consultant in Peachtree City , Georgia .
`` A lot of U.S. pilots are working overseas , more than ever before , '' Darby said . `` It 's pretty common . ''
Darby said that as airlines have consolidated in the U.S. , the job market for experienced airline captains has become `` stagnant . '' Experienced captains are losing seniority , and it may take them 10 to 20 years to get a captain 's position back , he said .
So they turn overseas , where aviation is expanding and there is a clear need for the experience the Americans bring . They typically end up captaining jetliners with co-pilots and crew who are from their host countries or from other countries where aviation professionals are less experienced .
The co-pilot of the Dana Air MD-83 that crashed Sunday was from India and the flight engineer from Indonesia , Wason said .
`` It 's a challenging position , half trainer and half pilot , '' Darby said of captaining a foreign-flagged airliner . But the rewards can be substantial .
Americans signing on to pilot jetliners in the Middle East , China and India can make well over $ 100,000 a year , plus add-ons like housing , according to Darby .
He said a pilot working in Africa would probably make a bit less than those working in Asia or the Mideast but would still do well .
`` The big deals come with the captain 's seat , '' he said .
The Dana Air MD-83 that crashed Sunday is a fairly new plane by African standards and would probably provide a well-paying post to a captain , Darby said .
American pilots looking to work overseas may negotiate their own deals or be matched up with a foreign carrier through a recruitment service , he said .
Wasinc International is one of those services . The company 's website currently lists 34 pilot positions with carriers in China .
For instance , Air China is hiring captains for Airbus A330 aircraft , and it will train . Pay is $ 4,000 a month during training and then $ 11,000 a month plus a $ 4,000 monthly living allowance once training is completed , according to the Wasinc ad .
The website BestAviation.net lists 101 pilot or first officer jobs in locations including China , Lithuania , Indonesia , Mauritania and South Korea .
In a report from February , Bloomberg said airlines in China will be hiring 16,000 pilots in the next three years , according to the Civil Aviation Administration of China .
Shen Wei , a recruiter for China 's Spring Air , told Bloomberg that China was a strong market for U.S. pilots .
“ Everyone is facing a pilot shortage , ” he 's quoted as saying . “ Foreign pilots are the quickest option . ”","The pilot of the Nigerian jetliner that crashed in Lagos, the country's largest city, on Sunday was an American, said Oscar Wason, Dana Air's director of operations, on Monday.

Wason did not identify the pilot by name or hometown, but he is among a legion of U.S. pilots now captaining jets for foreign airlines, said Kit Darby, an aviation consultant in Peachtree City, Georgia.

""A lot of U.S. pilots are working overseas, more than ever before,"" Darby said. ""It's pretty common.""

Darby said that as airlines have consolidated in the U.S., the job market for experienced airline captains has become ""stagnant."" Experienced captains are losing seniority, and it may take them 10 to 20 years to get a captain's position back, he said.

So they turn overseas, where aviation is expanding and there is a clear need for the experience the Americans bring. They typically end up captaining jetliners with co-pilots and crew who are from their host countries or from other countries where aviation professionals are less experienced.

The co-pilot of the Dana Air MD-83 that crashed Sunday was from India and the flight engineer from Indonesia, Wason said.

""It's a challenging position, half trainer and half pilot,"" Darby said of captaining a foreign-flagged airliner. But the rewards can be substantial.

Americans signing on to pilot jetliners in the Middle East, China and India can make well over $100,000 a year, plus add-ons like housing, according to Darby.

He said a pilot working in Africa would probably make a bit less than those working in Asia or the Mideast but would still do well.

""The big deals come with the captain's seat,"" he said.

The lawmakers cited 13 security-related incidents in Benghazi , several of which were previously unreported , in the six months before the attack that killed U.S . Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three others . The incidents included a pro-Gadhafi Facebook page that noted Mr. Stevens ’ habit of taking a morning run in Tripoli with members of his security detail and threatened him .
“ Multiple U.S. federal government officials have confirmed … that , prior to the Sept. 11 attack , the U.S. mission in Libya made repeated requests for increased security in Benghazi . The mission in Libya , however , was denied these resources by officials in Washington , ” Reps. Darrell E. Issa and Jason Chaffetz said in a letter Tuesday to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton .
Mr. Issa , California Republican and chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , and Mr. Chaffetz , Utah Republican and chairman of the national security subcommittee , said they would hold a hearing Oct. 10 . The State Department on Monday closed the consulate building in Benghazi and removed its staff from the city .
Meanwhile , The New York Times was reporting that the Pentagon ’ s Joint Special Operations Command was preparing data to help kill or capture militants suspected of conducting the Benghazi attack , citing military and counterterrorism officials .
State Department officials said Tuesday that Mrs. Clinton would respond immediately to Mr. Issa and Mr. Chaffetz and pledged the department ’ s cooperation with the congressional investigation , which will parallel four other probes into the attack .
“ Her response back today will make clear that we are determined to work with the Congress , that we will send folks to their hearing … It is our intention to cooperate fully , ” State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said .

Several former government officials have told The ███ that no reasonable security presence could have successfully defended the consulate against the sophisticated , multistage assault by extremists armed with automatic weapons , rocket-propelled grenade-launchers and mortars .
The attack came amid widespread protests directed against U.S. facilities throughout the Arab world , sparked by an Internet video denigrating Islam ’ s Prophet Muhammad .
For more than a week , administration officials hewed to talking points describing the attack as “ spontaneous , ” saying it had developed out of an angry demonstration outside the consulate . The U.S. director of national intelligence now says that information was the result of erroneous early analyses of the events and officials have linked it to terrorist groups .
Republicans have seized on the fact that it was eight days before officials used the words “ terrorist attack ” to describe the assault , and have accused the administration of trying to downplay the seriousness of the attack , because it contradicts President Obama ’ s election-campaign narrative about the success of his campaign against al Qaeda .
More hawkish conservatives have said the attack itself was provoked by “ weakness ” on the part of the administration in the Middle East .
Mr. Issa , whose committee has sweeping investigative powers , has just completed an aggressive probe of the Justice Department ’ s anti-gun-running operation Fast and Furious — an investigation which at times degenerated into partisan sniping .
At the least , the hearing on the Benghazi attack is sure to showcase the deep differences between the parties ’ views on the best stance to take in the face of popular fury at the United States as a result of the anti-Muhammad film .
It also may see some Democrats attempting to point a finger at Republicans . Last week , The ███ reported that the attack in Benghazi had followed two years of major cuts by Congress to State Department funding for embassy construction and diplomatic security .
Mr. Issa ’ s inquiry will join at least four others into the attack :
• As required by federal law , Mrs. Clinton has convened a special panel to report on security prior to the attack , choosing veteran diplomat Thomas Pickering to head it .

President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden have fiercely defended the nomination of Chuck Hagel , despite advisers and Hill Democrats who questioned the move and predicted a firestorm , according to Democratic sources .
That opinion was validated , at least for the moment , by events Thursday as Senate Republicans narrowly blocked cloture on Hagel ’ s nomination . Obama immediately slammed the filibuster — which could be broken after a 10-day congressional recess .
But an irked Obama is dead set on installing his pick at the Pentagon — even though the bitter battle over his confirmation is likely to leave lasting scars on his nominee at a time of looming military cuts and dangerous new developments in Iran and North Korea .

Senior Republicans told ███ late Thursday that there was a strong possibility that as many as “ 15 or 20 ” Senate Republicans would , in fact , vote for an end to debate after the recess — but none would vote yes before the break .

Republicans — many of them never close to the senator when he served — were even more taken aback , although at least one top GOP senator told his staff that Hagel seemed more poised and better prepared during his round of “ off the record ” one-on-one chats with senators .
“ Well , ” one GOP aide joked , adding Hagel “ couldn ’ t have done any worse ” than he did during his narcoleptic performance at the hearings .
Obama aides say the president tapped Hagel because he ’ s unafraid of sacred cows and will be willing to shake up Pentagon orthodoxy when warranted . But Thompson says Hagel ’ s polarizing confirmation process raises doubts about whether he ’ ll have the power base to undertake significant reforms .
“ It looks like Hagel can ’ t give Obama what Bill Cohen gave Clinton , ” Thompson said . “ Republicans are not as supportive of defense as they used to be and having Hagel in charge is certainly not going to reinforce their affinity for defense . … The big political question for Hagel ’ s tenure at the Pentagon is whether he can build a bridge to the Republicans or whether he will be so miffed by his treatment at the confirmation hearing that he in some way tries to take revenge . ”
During Obama ’ s first term , Washington heavyweights Robert Gates and Leon Panetta were able to run interference on the Hill and sometimes at the White House to ward off meddling that the Pentagon viewed as unwelcome . Republicans welcomed Gates as a Bush holdover and the Senate essentially approved Panetta by acclamation , voting 100-0 to confirm .
Perhaps Obama wants a defense secretary who ’ s not going to win a popularity contest in Congress .
Assuming Hagel wins confirmation , he clearly won ’ t be taking office with the degree of congressional support either of his predecessors had .
“ The Pentagon has enjoyed considerable protection during the first Obama administration , ” Thompson said . “ Now , it looks highly exposed to changing political currents . ”","Hagel has fans in the highest places, starting in the Oval Office. Why the W.H. went all-in on Hagel

“This is nothing but a pointless delay and the latest attempt to play politics on Benghazi. Chuck Hagel had nothing to do with Benghazi,” the aide said.

Senior Republicans told POLITICO late Thursday that there was a strong possibility that as many as “15 or 20” Senate Republicans would, in fact, vote for an end to debate after the recess — but none would vote yes before the break. Earlier this week, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told Democrats that the GOP didn’t want to set the precedent of using procedural means to block a defense nominee, even if many of his members planned to vote against their former colleague.

Republicans — many of them never close to the senator when he served — were even more taken aback, although at least one top GOP senator told his staff that Hagel seemed more poised and better prepared during his round of “off the record” one-on-one chats with senators.

“Well,” one GOP aide joked, adding Hagel “couldn’t have done any worse” than he did during his narcoleptic performance at the hearings.

Obama aides say the president tapped Hagel because he’s unafraid of sacred cows and will be willing to shake up Pentagon orthodoxy when warranted. But Thompson says Hagel’s polarizing confirmation process raises doubts about whether he’ll have the power base to undertake significant reforms.

“It looks like Hagel can’t give Obama what Bill Cohen gave Clinton,” Thompson said. “Republicans are not as supportive of defense as they used to be and having Hagel in charge is certainly not going to reinforce their affinity for defense. … The big political question for Hagel’s tenure at the Pentagon is whether he can build a bridge to the Republicans or whether he will be so miffed by his treatment at the confirmation hearing that he in some way tries to take revenge.”

During Obama’s first term, Washington heavyweights Robert Gates and Leon Panetta were able to run interference on the Hill and sometimes at the White House to ward off meddling that the Pentagon viewed as unwelcome. Republicans welcomed Gates as a Bush holdover and the Senate essentially approved Panetta by acclamation, voting 100-0 to confirm.

Perhaps Obama wants a defense secretary who’s not going to win a popularity contest in Congress.

Assuming Hagel wins confirmation, he clearly won’t be taking office with the degree of congressional support either of his predecessors had.

“The Pentagon has enjoyed considerable protection during the first Obama administration,” Thompson said. “Now, it looks highly exposed to changing political currents.”",www.politico.com,left,nJR58rLVBGl6iigY

US Navy chief Richard Spencer has been fired over his handling of the case of a Navy Seal demoted for misconduct.

The case of Edward Gallagher, who was convicted for posing with a corpse, had sparked tensions between US President Donald Trump and military officials.

The navy officer had been due to face a disciplinary review where he could have been stripped of his Seals membership.

There have been differing accounts as to why Richard Spencer was asked to resign.

US Defence Secretary Mark Esper said he had lost confidence in the navy secretary because his private conversations with the White House contradicted his public position.

How did we get here?

Gallagher was accused of stabbing an unarmed 17-year-old Islamic State group prisoner to death and randomly shooting civilians while serving in Iraq in 2017.

He was acquitted of those charges and convicted only of the lesser charge of posing with the IS prisoner's corpse.

For that, he was demoted, but President Trump later reinstated his rank.

Mr Trump tweeted his disapproval of this on Thursday, saying the navy would ""NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher's Trident Pin"".

Why was Spencer fired?

On Sunday, the defence department said Mr Esper had asked Mr Spencer to resign due to ""his lack of candour"".

Mr Spencer had made private proposals to the White House, which he did not share with Mr Esper, and had contradicted his public position, Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffmann said in a statement.

It was a trash agreement . It always was—and it didn ’ t prevent the nation from acquiring nuclear weapons . On the contrary , once the deal expired in 10-15 years , the country could get back on track to obtaining nuclear arms . This was even admitted as fact by former President Barack Obama . All this agreement did was give Barry time to avoid bombing the country or taking any military action that would cripple their nuclear ambitions . Even after the agreement was signed , German intelligence was quite clear that Iran still pursued banned missile and nuclear components . Guy has been tracking this whole saga from the negotiation table to the Trump administration ’ s decision to withdraw from the agreement . It seemed pretty clear from the get-go that Iran was not going to keep its end of the bargain . Gee—a state-sponsor of terror not complying fully with an international agreement ? I ’ m shocked ( via NYT ) [ emphasis mine ] :
Iran ’ s president declared on Wednesday that the country would stop complying with two of its commitments under the Iranian nuclear deal , pushing the growing confrontation between Washington and Tehran into new and potentially dangerous territory . The announcement by President Hassan Rouhani came exactly a year after President Trump withdrew entirely from the 2015 agreement , which limited Iran ’ s capacity to produce nuclear fuel for 15 years . But Mr. Rouhani did not follow Mr. Trump ’ s path and renounce the entire agreement . Instead , he notified European nations that he was taking some carefully calibrated steps , and that he would give Europe 60 days to choose between following Mr. Trump or saving the deal by engaging in oil trade with Iran in violation of American unilateral sanctions . “ The path we have chosen today is not the path of war , it is the path of diplomacy , ” he said in a nationally broadcast speech . “ But diplomacy with a new language and a new logic. ” Starting on Wednesday , he said , Iran would begin to build up its stockpiles of low enriched uranium and of heavy water , which is used in nuclear reactors — including a reactor that could give Iran a source of bomb-grade plutonium . If the Europeans fail to compensate for the unilateral American sanctions , he said , Iran will resume construction of the Arak nuclear reactor , a facility that was shut down , and its key components dismantled , under the deal .
Oh , and the Times spun this by adding , “ None of those actions would get Iran to a weapon anytime soon . But they would resume a slow , steady march that the 2015 agreement temporarily stopped. ” Uh , Iran just said they ’ re restarting their initiative to manufacture nuclear weapons . Okay—maybe that goal never really stopped , even under Obama ’ s failed Iran deal , but it ’ s not good . Fast or slow , a state-sponsor of terror , that the Obama White House thought they could negotiate with , is back to trying to build nuclear weapons . Watch this also be spun as Trump ’ s fault . It ’ s not . Trump was right to…nuke the whole agreement . I ’ ll let Guy explain why :
By Obama 's own admission , the Iran nuclear agreement clears the way for the regime to achieve threshold nuclear-armed status . The pact 's key Western-imposed restrictions automatically expire after a period of 10-15 years , over which time period Iran is explicitly permitted to enrich uranium , utilize advanced centrifuges , and continue key research and development activities . The regime 's nuclear program was not dismantled by any stretch of the imagination under the accord ; it was , at best , partially and temporarily mothballed . [ … ] New evidence illustrates and demonstrates the depths of Iranian deceit . Part of the deal was that Tehran had to be 100 percent transparent about its nuclear history , owning up to the full extent of its previous activities on that front . Doing so was a mandatory prerequisite prior to implementation . Rather than acting in good faith and admitting their prior pursuit of nuclear weapons , Iran lied -- repeatedly -- while secretly hiding its vast trove of nuclear know-how , specifically cataloged for the purpose of developing nuclear weapons in the future . The idea , it seems , was to dupe the West into offering all sorts of goodies along the way , only to dust off their nuclear research when the coast was relatively clear . Almost everyone suspected that Iran was lying about its previous activities , but Israel'srecent intelligence bonanza proves it beyond a shadow of a doubt . [ … ] A final , important point on the legality and legitimacy of Trump 's unilateral action… Many of us argued precisely this point during the political fight over the Iran deal , but it fell on deaf ears . Obama and John Kerry were dead set on a legacy `` achievement , '' and nothing was going to stand in their way . When push came to shove , Congress was reduced to casting a symbolic vote against the accord . More than 60 percent of all Senators and Representatives voted in opposition to the plan ( 327 out of 535 voting members ) , including dozens of House Democrats and a number of high-ranking upper chamber Democrats . Even in an era of pitched partisanship , the likes of Chuck Schumer and Bob Menendez and Ben Cardin could not bring themselves to endorse a reckless nuclear giveaway engineered by their own party 's president .
Yeah , this nuclear deal was total garbage ; even Chuck Schumer knew it . It was just a stopgap for avoiding a military decision on Iran because Obama ’ s foreign policy was a dithering , over-analyzed , and feckless mess . One that Trump now is in the process of fixing .","Well, this is only news in the sense that Iran now has officially declared that they will no longer comply with some of the provisions in the coveted international nuclear agreement that was touted by the Obama administration.

On the contrary, once the deal expired in 10-15 years, the country could get back on track to obtaining nuclear arms. This was even admitted as fact by former President Barack Obama. All this agreement did was give Barry time to avoid bombing the country or taking any military action that would cripple their nuclear ambitions. Even after the agreement was signed, German intelligence was quite clear that Iran still pursued banned missile and nuclear components. Guy has been tracking this whole saga from the negotiation table to the Trump administration’s decision to withdraw from the agreement. It seemed pretty clear from the get-go that Iran was not going to keep its end of the bargain. Gee—a state-sponsor of terror not complying fully with an international agreement? I’m shocked (via NYT) [emphasis mine]:

Iran’s president declared on Wednesday that the country would stop complying with two of its commitments under the Iranian nuclear deal, pushing the growing confrontation between Washington and Tehran into new and potentially dangerous territory. The announcement by President Hassan Rouhani came exactly a year after President Trump withdrew entirely from the 2015 agreement, which limited Iran’s capacity to produce nuclear fuel for 15 years. But Mr. Rouhani did not follow Mr. Trump’s path and renounce the entire agreement. Instead, he notified European nations that he was taking some carefully calibrated steps, and that he would give Europe 60 days to choose between following Mr. Trump or saving the deal by engaging in oil trade with Iran in violation of American unilateral sanctions. “The path we have chosen today is not the path of war, it is the path of diplomacy,” he said in a nationally broadcast speech. “But diplomacy with a new language and a new logic.” Starting on Wednesday, he said, Iran would begin to build up its stockpiles of low enriched uranium and of heavy water, which is used in nuclear reactors — including a reactor that could give Iran a source of bomb-grade plutonium. If the Europeans fail to compensate for the unilateral American sanctions, he said, Iran will resume construction of the Arak nuclear reactor, a facility that was shut down, and its key components dismantled, under the deal.

Oh, and the Times spun this by adding, “None of those actions would get Iran to a weapon anytime soon. But they would resume a slow, steady march that the 2015 agreement temporarily stopped.” Uh, Iran just said they’re restarting their initiative to manufacture nuclear weapons. Okay—maybe that goal never really stopped, even under Obama’s failed Iran deal, but it’s not good. Fast or slow, a state-sponsor of terror, that the Obama White House thought they could negotiate with, is back to trying to build nuclear weapons. Watch this also be spun as Trump’s fault. It’s not. Trump was right to…nuke the whole agreement. I’ll let Guy explain why:

By Obama's own admission, the Iran nuclear agreement clears the way for the regime to achieve threshold nuclear-armed status. The pact's key Western-imposed restrictions automatically expire after a period of 10-15 years, over which time period Iran is explicitly permitted to enrich uranium, utilize advanced centrifuges, and continue key research and development activities. The regime's nuclear program was not dismantled by any stretch of the imagination under the accord; it was, at best, partially and temporarily mothballed. […] New evidence illustrates and demonstrates the depths of Iranian deceit. Part of the deal was that Tehran had to be 100 percent transparent about its nuclear history, owning up to the full extent of its previous activities on that front. Doing so was a mandatory prerequisite prior to implementation. Rather than acting in good faith and admitting their prior pursuit of nuclear weapons, Iran lied -- repeatedly -- while secretly hiding its vast trove of nuclear know-how, specifically cataloged for the purpose of developing nuclear weapons in the future. The idea, it seems, was to dupe the West into offering all sorts of goodies along the way, only to dust off their nuclear research when the coast was relatively clear. Almost everyone suspected that Iran was lying about its previous activities, but Israel'srecent intelligence bonanza proves it beyond a shadow of a doubt. […] A final, important point on the legality and legitimacy of Trump's unilateral action… Many of us argued precisely this point during the political fight over the Iran deal, but it fell on deaf ears. Obama and John Kerry were dead set on a legacy ""achievement,"" and nothing was going to stand in their way. When push came to shove, Congress was reduced to casting a symbolic vote against the accord. More than 60 percent of all Senators and Representatives voted in opposition to the plan (327 out of 535 voting members), including dozens of House Democrats and a number of high-ranking upper chamber Democrats. Even in an era of pitched partisanship, the likes of Chuck Schumer and Bob Menendez and Ben Cardin could not bring themselves to endorse a reckless nuclear giveaway engineered by their own party's president.

Yeah, this nuclear deal was total garbage; even Chuck Schumer knew it. It was just a stopgap for avoiding a military decision on Iran because Obama’s foreign policy was a dithering, over-analyzed, and feckless mess.

Breaking with President-elect Donald Trump , James Mattis said Thursday in his confirmation hearing to be defense secretary that he supports a permanent U.S. military presence in the Baltics to deter Russia — and reiterated that he believes the U.S. must stick to the Iran nuclear deal even if it is flawed .
The retired Marine Corps general initially tried to dodge the question on Eastern Europe , saying he ’ d wait until Trump ’ s national security team was in place.But when panel Chairman John McCain pressed him on using American forces as a trip wire along Russia 's borders , Mattis said he agreed : “ I do , sir . ''
Mattis separately described Moscow as `` raising grave concerns on several fronts . ''
His remarks , including a strong endorsement of the NATO military alliance , are a departure from Trump , who has been accused of cozying up to Russian President Vladimir Putin and has repeatedly denigrated NATO and other U.S. alliances on the campaign trail under the banner of “ America First . ”
Trump has also promised to rip up the 2015 agreement to lift sanctions on Iran in return for the Islamic Republic freezing its nuclear weapons program , a deal that was reached with several nations , including Russia .
Mattis , who retired from the military as a four-star general in 2013 , repeatedly touted the importance of international partnerships during his testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee .
“ History is clear : nations with strong allies thrive and those without them wither , ” Mattis said .
Mattis also said he was a strong supporter of NATO in a lengthy questionnaire he provided to the panel . “ NATO is central to our defense , ” Mattis said . “ I believe the alliance must harness renewed political will to confront and walk back aggressive Russian actions and other threats to the security of its members . ”
His overall views are almost certain to play well among members of the Senate Armed Services panel , which is made up of some of the biggest defense hawks in both parties — including a number of senators who are very concerned about Trump ’ s disparagement of global alliances and his embrace of Putin .
Mattis ’ remarks on Iran , however , will likely frustrate some of the biggest critics of the nuclear pact .
“ I think it is an imperfect arms control agreement — it 's not a friendship treaty , ” Mattis said . “ But when America gives her word , we have to live up to it and work with our allies . ”
Here are some other highlights of Mattis ’ confirmation hearing testimony :
The retired general , a popular pick whose confirmation is all but assured , will still require a waiver from both the Senate and House to get an exception to the legal prohibition on retired military officials serving as defense secretary unless they have been out of uniform for at least seven years .
Mattis , just three years out of uniform , said he recognizes his post would be a civilian role , differing “ in essence and in substance from my former role in uniform . ”
“ Civilian control of the military is a fundamental tenet of the American military tradition , ” Mattis said in his written testimony . “ If the Senate consents and if the full Congress passes an exception to the seven-year requirement , I will provide strong civilian leadership of military plans and decisions . ”
‘ No plan to oppose women in any aspect of our military ’
Mattis has won bipartisan praise among the senators who will decide his fate , with key Democrats viewing him as a tested battlefield commander who could temper Trump on human-rights issues like torture .
But a number of Democrats said ahead of the hearing they were worried about Mattis ’ views on military social issues , particularly women in combat , which he has opposed in the past .
In the hearing , Mattis indicated he did not plan to undo the Obama administration ’ s 2015 decision to open all combat jobs to women — though he did not completely close off the possibility .
“ I have no plan to oppose women in any aspect of our military , ” Mattis said Thursday . “ I ’ m coming in with the understanding that I lead the Department of Defense , and if someone brings me a problem I will look at it . But I ’ m not coming in looking for problems . ”
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ( D-N.Y. ) , who asked the most pointed questions of Mattis , also pressed him on allowing gay and lesbian troops to serve openly .
“ Do you believe that allowing LGBT Americans to serve in the military or women in combat is undermining our lethality ? ” she asked .
“ Frankly , I ’ ve never cared much about two consenting adults and who they go to bed with , ” Mattis responded , though he did not state directly that he would not consider policy changes on these issues .
Mattis laid out a series of top goals should he be confirmed , ranging from beefing up the preparedness of individual fighting units and improving the Pentagon ’ s business practices .
He told the panel his priorities as Pentagon chief would be to “ strengthen military readiness , strengthen our alliances in league with our diplomatic partners , and bring business reforms to the Department of Defense by instilling budget discipline and holding our leaders accountable . ”

Mattis’ remarks on Iran, however, will likely frustrate some of the biggest critics of the nuclear pact.

“I think it is an imperfect arms control agreement — it's not a friendship treaty,” Mattis said. “But when America gives her word, we have to live up to it and work with our allies.”

Here are some other highlights of Mattis’ confirmation hearing testimony:

Civilian control of the military sacrosanct

The retired general, a popular pick whose confirmation is all but assured, will still require a waiver from both the Senate and House to get an exception to the legal prohibition on retired military officials serving as defense secretary unless they have been out of uniform for at least seven years.

Mattis, just three years out of uniform, said he recognizes his post would be a civilian role, differing “in essence and in substance from my former role in uniform.”

“Civilian control of the military is a fundamental tenet of the American military tradition,” Mattis said in his written testimony. “If the Senate consents and if the full Congress passes an exception to the seven-year requirement, I will provide strong civilian leadership of military plans and decisions.”

‘No plan to oppose women in any aspect of our military’

Mattis has won bipartisan praise among the senators who will decide his fate, with key Democrats viewing him as a tested battlefield commander who could temper Trump on human-rights issues like torture.

But a number of Democrats said ahead of the hearing they were worried about Mattis’ views on military social issues, particularly women in combat, which he has opposed in the past.

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who asked the most pointed questions of Mattis, also pressed him on allowing gay and lesbian troops to serve openly.

“Do you believe that allowing LGBT Americans to serve in the military or women in combat is undermining our lethality?” she asked.

“Frankly, I’ve never cared much about two consenting adults and who they go to bed with,” Mattis responded, though he did not state directly that he would not consider policy changes on these issues.

‘Instilling budget discipline’

Mattis laid out a series of top goals should he be confirmed, ranging from beefing up the preparedness of individual fighting units and improving the Pentagon’s business practices.

He told the panel his priorities as Pentagon chief would be to “strengthen military readiness, strengthen our alliances in league with our diplomatic partners, and bring business reforms to the Department of Defense by instilling budget discipline and holding our leaders accountable.”

Says Trump ‘serious…about keeping these costs under control.""

Mattis would not speak directly to Trump’s controversial social media attacks on the F-35 fighter and Air Force One programs over their cost.

""It’s not my role to comment on the president elect’s statements other than to say I believe it shows he is serious about getting the best bang for the dollar when it comes to defense dollars and that is where I find common ground with him,"" he told Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), who complained “these tweets have impacted markets, creating instability and uncertainty in the industry. I don’t think that is the best way to get this point across.""

But Mattis said the broadsides show Trump is serious about controlling costs.

“I want to be able to come to you and say, ‘Here’s the money you gave us and here’s what we did with it.’ And I see his statements about the cost of certain defense programs as showing his serious side about keeping these costs under control,” Mattis said.

Putin ‘trying to break the North Atlantic alliance’

Mattis also broke with Trump in his assessment of Russia, warning that the Kremlin is trying to break up NATO.

McCain asked Mattis whether he thought Trump would have more success than past presidents when it came to improving relations with Russia.

“Chairman, history is not a straitjacket, but I’ve never found a better guide for the way ahead than studying history,” Mattis responded.

“I think right now, the most important thing is that we recognize the reality of what we deal with with Mr. Putin,” he continued. “And we recognize that he’s trying to break the North Atlantic alliance, and we take the steps, the integrated steps, the diplomatic, economic, military and the Alliance steps in working with our allies to defend ourselves where we must.”

McCain talks to Trump, not Mattis, on Russia

McCain was effectively talking to Trump — and not Mattis — when he went on a lengthy statement against Russia and Putin.

“Each of our last three presidents has had great expectations of building a partnership with the Russian government,” McCain said in his opening statement. “Each attempt has failed, not for lack of good faith and effort on the U.S. side, but because of a stubborn fact that we must finally recognize: Putin wants to be our enemy. He needs us as his enemy. “

The Arizona Republican has criticized Trump for saying he wants warmer relations with Russia and Putin, concluding Thursday that Putin “will never be our partner.”

“We must build a position of significant strength vis-à-vis Russia and any other adversary that seeks to undermine our national interests and challenge the world order,” McCain said. “We must re-establish deterrence. And that is primarily the job of the Department of Defense.”

Mattis backs keeping Iran deal

While Mattis is known as an Iran hawk, he said Thursday he believed the United States should stick with the Iranian nuclear deal.

“I think it is an imperfect arms control agreement — it’s not a friendship treaty,” Mattis said in response to questions from Senate Armed Services ranking member Jack Reed (D-R.I.). “But when America gives her word, we have to live up to it and work with our allies.”

The Iran deal could become another source of tension between Mattis and Trump, who repeatedly blasted the deal on the campaign trail and pledged to rip it up.

Jim Mattis, still a general

Changing roles after a four-decade career isn’t easy.

When Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) was pressing the retired Marine general on how to stop using the war budget to skirt spending limits, Mattis said he shared her goal of fixing the issue, though he wasn’t sure how to solve it under the Budget Control Act.

Then, Mattis concluded his comments with a statement he likely gave dozens of times testifying before Congress while in uniform: “I share 100 percent of your frustration and goal, but I can’t tell you I know how to get there other than giving you my best military advice,” he said.

The issue? Mattis won’t be offering his best military advice as a civilian defense secretary.

Mad Dog, or Braveheart?

Former Defense Secretary William Cohen, who, along with former Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), introduced Mattis, was first to address the nickname that Mattis reportedly doesn’t like but has been unable to shake.

“He has the nickname of ‘Mad Dog’ — it’s a misnomer,” Cohen said. “It should be ‘Braveheart.’ Because what really characterizes Jim Mattis is his courage.”

Taking its first flight in 1975 , it was not designed for air-to-air combat like the F-15 Eagle . It 's not sleek or stealthy like the F-22 Raptor . It has never taken a leading role in Hollywood blockbusters like the F-14 Tomcat or F/A-18 Hornet .
But what it lacks in performance and good looks , it makes up for with pure brute punching power . If the F-15 is the Tom Brady of the Air Force , the A-10 is Lawrence Taylor . It is arguably one of the most important post-9/11 aerial fighters in the United States arsenal . It is also close to being put out to pasture .
Better known as the Warthog , the A-10 has fought pitched battles with Iraqi insurgents , the Taliban and more recently , ISIS fighters . But the most dangerous foe the aircraft has is budget sequestration and shifting Air Force priorities , not ground fire . As it stands , the venerable warbird is only surviving year to year and may soon be eliminated .
Budget sequestration has put a serious strain on Air Force funds , and the Pentagon leadership thinks the A-10 is too expensive to maintain under the current spending limits when other aircraft can fill similar roles . And several congressmen involved with military allocations believe other expensive undertakings -- like finding ways to neutralize the highly deadly improvised explosive devices U.S. soldiers face in the Middle East -- are higher funding priorities .

Looming over the debate is the sleek , super-high-tech , massively expensive F-35 Lightning . The F-35 is the RGIII of the Air Force ; like the Washington quarterback , it has a ton of potential but is riddled with setbacks . The original goal was to retire the A-10 as the F-35 came online , but the F-35 is still a long way from deployment .
Despite not having a replacement , the Air Force is still determined to mothball the A-10 , which is very popular with soldiers and Marines who have benefited from its air support , and with former A-10 pilot and GOP Arizona Rep. Martha McSally . The military plans to fill the gap with existing aircraft .
The A-10 was designed to carry the massive 30 mm GAU-8 Avenger multibarrel canon . Shooting huge depleted uranium bullets at a high speed , the Warthog 's canon was intended to kill any invading Soviet tanks rumbling into West Germany through the Fulda Gap . Instead , it found its mythology written in the skies over Iraq and Afghanistan .
Many U.S. military aircraft carry out close air support missions , but the A-10 is the only airplane in the Air Force specifically designed for it . Referred to as CAS in the military , close air support covers ground troops from an enemy advance using an aerial weapons strike . CAS missions buy time for grunts to regroup or get out .
Able to circle over a target for long periods , the straight-winged Warthog is supremely maneuverable at low speeds and altitudes . So when ground troops find themselves in trouble -- and too close to the enemy for fighter jets to drop bombs without risking friendly fire casualties -- A-10 pilots can skim hillsides day and night , under any type of weather , and accurately and punishingly engage ground targets with its powerful cannon .
And because it was meant to fight in the weeds , the Warthog can take a terrible beating , protecting its pilot with a heavily armored cockpit and backup flight systems . When caught between a rock and a hard place , grunts love the sound of an incoming A-10 .
While filling the large shoes of the A-10 , specifically designed for close air support , with a fast mover like the F-35 will be challenging , aircraft such as the F-16 and even B-1 bombers -- which use modern precision-guided munitions -- already perform that roll very effectively .
According to the Air Force , during the most recent operations against ISIS , aircraft such as the F-16 , F-15 and — in its debut on the battlefront— the F-22 Raptor have been involved in support of anti-ISIS forces . During a briefing in January , Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James stated that many strike platforms contribute to the fight , with just 11 % coming from the A-10 community .
One of the A-10 's most dedicated advocates is the Arizona congresswoman and retired A-10 squadron commander McSally . McSally was among the first women to fly combat aircraft and chose to pilot the A-10 over planes like the F-15 . The Afghanistan War veteran is passionate about the Warthog 's ground support role .

`` This is a mission where we show up when Americans ' lives are at risk , '' McSally said . `` When they 're on the ground , they need help , under fire , and we show up right on the front lines and deliver the firepower so they can live to fight another day . ''
She also pointed out that the Warthog still plays its Cold War role , holding the line against a possible resurgent Russian threat in Europe . A dozen A-10s from Arizona are in Romania right now .
Last week the freshman Republican , whose district includes Davis-Monthan Air Force Base , home to 80 Warthogs , fought to keep the plane flying by attaching amendments to the draft 2016 National Defense Authorization Act , funding it for another year .
But that did n't happen without some debate . A-10 support has been fairly bipartisan , as was some of the opposition to McSally 's amendment .
Among the challengers on Capitol Hill is former Marine officer and fellow first-term Rep. Seth Moulton , a Massachusetts Democrat . Moulton said he appreciates the A-10 but does n't understand the point of keeping an aircraft the Air Force wants to retire at the expense of other important military programs .
`` What you never hear from the appeals of the A-10 community is what the trade-offs are -- and they are big . '' Moulton said during debate on the McSally amendment .
The Iraq War veteran pointed to $ 682 million the committee had to carve out of this year 's defense budget -- or $ 4 billion over four years .
`` It is a good plane , and having some number of them might be a good idea , but it is not the only aircraft that does air support and it 's definitely not the only thing our military needs , '' he said .
Moulton instead offered a substitute amendment that would fund a smaller number of A-10s , 119 in all , and shift dollars to other needs , including countering improvised explosive devices , which have devastated front-line infantry troops .
`` IEDs were the No . 1 killer of Americans in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars . '' Molten said , `` Far more than will die from ( them than in ) the rare scenarios where only an A-10 can provide close air support . ''
A fellow Marine officer and Iraq vet , California Republican Duncan Hunter , agreed with Moulton that Warthog funds would better be used against IEDs . Hunter said of the money in Moulton 's plan : `` Where he 's putting it will save more lives . That 's plain and simple . ''

But its future is far from secure .","Tucson, Arizona (CNN) The A-10 Thunderbolt II is a lumbering, old airplane.

In the letter he submitted on his way out the door , he did not say that he resigned but rather stated , `` I hereby acknowledge my termination . ''
The letter delivered a scathing rebuke of Trump , who he said did not agree with him on the importance of military justice and discipline . He also said he had been given an order that he could not in `` good conscience obey . ''
The Navy had planned a review that could have led to Gallagher 's expulsion from the elite SEAL commando group , but Trump said in a tweet that Gallagher should remain a SEAL . A day after denying news reports that he had threatened to resign over Trump 's intervention , Spencer was out .
Gallagher was acquitted of stabbing an Islamic State prisoner in U.S. custody and firing on Iraqi civilians , but was found guilty of posing with the ISIS prisoner 's corpse .
Though Spencer 's letter indicated he was fired because of the Gallagher affair , Esper accused Spencer of going behind his back to talk with the White House about how to resolve the case .
Esper told reporters on Monday that Spencer – in contrast to his stated position that the Navy review should be carried out independently – had offered to ensure the review would result in Gallagher being permitted to remain a SEAL , have his rank restored and retire .

Richard Spencer did not go quietly after Defense Secretary Mark Esper asked for his resignation as secretary of the Navy over his handling of the case of SEAL Eddie Gallagher, whose demotion for taking a photo with a corpse had been reversed by President Donald Trump.

In the letter he submitted on his way out the door, he did not say that he resigned but rather stated, ""I hereby acknowledge my termination.""

The letter delivered a scathing rebuke of Trump, who he said did not agree with him on the importance of military justice and discipline. He also said he had been given an order that he could not in ""good conscience obey.""

The Navy had planned a review that could have led to Gallagher's expulsion from the elite SEAL commando group, but Trump said in a tweet that Gallagher should remain a SEAL. A day after denying news reports that he had threatened to resign over Trump's intervention, Spencer was out.

Gallagher was acquitted of stabbing an Islamic State prisoner in U.S. custody and firing on Iraqi civilians, but was found guilty of posing with the ISIS prisoner's corpse.

Though Spencer's letter indicated he was fired because of the Gallagher affair, Esper accused Spencer of going behind his back to talk with the White House about how to resolve the case.

Esper told reporters on Monday that Spencer – in contrast to his stated position that the Navy review should be carried out independently – had offered to ensure the review would result in Gallagher being permitted to remain a SEAL, have his rank restored and retire.

Trump said he was fired because he did not like how Gallagher had been treated and because of ""cost overruns,"" which he blamed on the Obama administration.

Here is the full text of Spencer's letter:

Dear Mr. President:

It has been the extreme honor of a lifetime to stand alongside the men and women of the Navy and Marine Corps team in the protection of the American people and the values we all hold dear.

Together we have made great strides over the past two years, strengthening the foundation of our readiness, and bolstering our constellation of allies and partners, to respond wherever needed with the honor and professionalism that have marked our force for the past 244 years.

Now more than ever, the United States Navy and Marine Corps stands ready and firm in every part of the globe, fueled at all times by our greatest resource – the men and women who wear the uniform. Many of them will soon miss their Thanksgiving dinners at home so that they can continue the watch beyond the curve of the horizon. They and their families are, and will forever be, my personal heroes.

As Secretary of the Navy, one of the most important responsibilities I have to our people is to maintain good order and discipline throughout the ranks. I regard this as deadly serious business. The lives of our Sailors, Marines and civilian teammates quite literally depend on the professional execution of our many missions, and they also depend on the ongoing faith and support of the people we serve and the allies we serve alongside.

The rule of law is what sets us apart from our adversaries. Good order and discipline is what has enabled our victory against foreign tyranny time and again, from Captain Lawrence's famous order ""Don't Give up the Ship,"" to the discipline and determination that propelled our flag to the highest point of Iwo Jima. The Constitution, and the Uniform Code of Military Justice, are the shields that set us apart, and the beacons that protect us all. Through my Title Ten Authority, I have strived to ensure our proceedings are fair, transparent and consistent, from the newest recruit to the Flag and General Officer level.

Unfortunately, it has become apparent that in this respect, I no longer share the same understanding with the Commander in Chief who appointed me, in regards to the key principle of good order and discipline. I cannot in good conscience obey an order that I believe violates the sacred oath I took in the presence of my family, my flag and my faith to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.

The President deserves and should expect a Secretary of the Navy who is aligned with his vision for the future of our force generation and sustainment. Therefore, with pride in the achievements we've shared, and everlasting faith in the continued service and fidelity of the finest Sailors, Marines and civilian teammates on earth, I hereby acknowledge my termination as United States Secretary of the Navy, to be effective immediately.

I will forever be grateful for every opportunity to have served, from my days as a Marine, to the extreme honor of serving as the 76th Secretary of the Navy. My wife Polly and I stand in appreciation and admiration of the patriots who today forge the next link in the unbroken chain of our Navy and Marine Corps, and we urge all Americans to keep them, and their families, in their hearts and prayers through this holiday season and beyond.

Thank you once again for the opportunity to serve.

Respectfully yours,

Richard V. Spencer

The Republican mantra for decades has been : cut NPR , EPA and the National Endowment for the Arts .
In the modern history of the Republican Party , it would have been unthinkable . The GOP is built on two core tenets — small government and big defense spending — and for decades , the two ideas co-existed peacefully . Republicans wanted to cut the federal budget — everywhere except the Pentagon . No more .
The reason : A new breed of conservatives in the House cares so much about cutting spending they ’ re willing to extend that to the budget for bullets and bombs , too — in this case , by letting $ 500 billion in across-the-board automatic budget cuts over 10 years take effect , alongside a similar number for domestic agencies .
“ I ’ m reading what a lot of different members are saying , and I find there ’ s not as much opposition to sequestration as I thought there might be , ” Rep. Bill Young ( R-Fla. ) , the chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee in charge of the Pentagon ’ s purse strings , told ███ .
“ I don ’ t think I have any real feeling for which direction this House is going , and this is the first time in a long time that I haven ’ t had a pretty good feel for it , ” Young added .
It ’ s got defense hawks in the House on edge — and on the defensive . But the members of the next generation say their argument is straightforward : Of course they want a strong national defense , but spending is spending .
“ What you ’ re hearing from some folks about the status of the sequester simply tells you that there ’ s a group of Republicans who are willing to look at the Defense Department equally with the other departments , ” said Rep. Mick Mulvaney ( R-S.C. ) , a sophomore who has been leading the campaign for spending cuts , including at the Pentagon .
“ I think Republicans lose credibility when they say we have to look everywhere for savings except defense , ” he added .
Republican Policy Committee Chairman James Lankford of Oklahoma said sequester isn ’ t his first choice . He ’ d rather shift cuts to domestic programs , but he knows that ’ s an idea Senate Democrats aren ’ t going to swallow .
“ I haven ’ t done the head count , but I can tell you a large part is committed to saying we have to reduce spending . We ’ d rather do it another way . But if the only way it can be done is sequestration , then it has to be done , ” said Lankford , a sophomore who quickly rose to the top ranks of Republican leadership .
Right now , bets are on the automatic cuts taking place . It would take a dramatic , last-minute action from the White House to prevent them .
And sequestration saber rattling is loud enough that the defense industry is taking notice . Pentagon brass , who had long insisted they weren ’ t planning for sequestration , outlined several short-term personnel measures in case Congress doesn ’ t turn off the automatic cuts by the March 1 deadline , including hiring freezes , voluntary early retirements and furloughs of up to 30 days .
The reasons for the GOP ’ s political shift are many : America is the world ’ s lone superpower , with its military might unchallenged . The nation — and even some Republicans — are weary of war , as President Barack Obama wound down the involvement in Iraq and is winding down the one in Afghanistan .
But first and foremost , some of these newly elected conservatives had the backing of the tea party — whose central tenet is cutting what it sees as runaway federal spending , wherever it is , and stopping an explosion of dangerous deficits and debt .
And that ’ s showing up on the House floor : House GOP floor votes in recent weeks suggest Speaker John Boehner won ’ t be catching many breaks as he works with an unruly conference in search of big cuts on the big-ticket fiscal questions of the day , including sequestration , increasing the nation ’ s $ 16.4 trillion borrowing limit and the expiration of the continuing resolution at the end of March .
For example , 157 Republicans voted for Mulvaney ’ s amendment to the Hurricane Sandy relief bill that would have slashed all government spending , including the Pentagon ’ s , as a budget offset . ( The amendment failed thanks to opposition from Democrats and 71 Republicans . )
The first House roll call of the 113th Congress — to provide $ 9.7 billion in flood insurance for Sandy victims — garnered 67 “ no ” votes . Nearly half came from freshman and sophomore Republicans .
Even defense hawks aren ’ t immune to registering their objections over how GOP leaders have handled the budget and tax negotiations with the Obama White House . The last-minute fiscal cliff deal that passed last month — extending George W. Bush-era tax cuts and postponing sequestration until March — won the support of just 10 of the 35 Republican members of the House Armed Services Committee .
Among House GOP lawmakers known as Pentagon stalwarts , several said they were alarmed by floor vote defections and the rhetoric from fellow Republicans . They recognize they ’ re the ones playing defense now on the military budget .
“ There are people that think we need to cut more , ” House Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon ( R-Calif. ) acknowledged in an interview .
McKeon said he ’ s been pushing back against budget hawks in the GOP conference by pointing to the nearly $ 600 billion in spending cuts that the Pentagon has already absorbed in recent years — and that ’ s before sequestration would even begin .
Even if budget hawks were to get their way , McKeon added , the sequestration cuts slated to hit the Pentagon and the rest of the federal budget in March — stretched out over a decade — won ’ t make a dent against the deficit .
“ At a time when China is increasing their defense spending and we ’ re having all these hot spots and troubles around the world , I ’ m thinking that really people don ’ t all see the whole big picture and don ’ t understand that if you totally eliminated the Defense Department , totally eliminated federal spending on education , on transportation , on parks , on everything that we vote on , if you eliminate all discretionary budgets , we ’ d still be running a deficit of a half-trillion dollars a year , ” he said .
But that money does make a difference for the Defense Department and its ever-changing mission , including new threats in Africa . McKeon said he ’ s telling Republicans that lives are at stake if the sequestration spending cuts go forward .
“ The military is going to be asked to do more with less . Every time we do that , every time we cut the military back in our history going into World War II , and to Korea and to Vietnam , we lost people because we had cut back too much , and I don ’ t want to see that happen , ” he said .
Not all House GOP freshmen say they would support voting to let the automatic Pentagon cuts as currently constituted go forward .
“ Overall , we have to save money in the budget , but sequestration is not the way to do it , ” said Oklahoma Rep. Jim Bridenstine , a Navy pilot and Armed Services Committee member who joined eight other Republicans last month voting against Boehner ’ s election as speaker . “ Sequestration needs to be undone .

""The fact is that the president does believe that the military course that he has already ordered was already authorized by the United States Congress under the 2001 AUMF,"" Earnest said in response to a question suggesting that Obama ""needed"" a new AUMF.

""So this is not a matter of legal necessity,"" Earnest continued. ""It is a matter however, of the president's desire to send a very clear signal to the people of this country, to our allies, and to our enemies that the United States of America and our political system is united behind the strategy to degrade and destroy ISIL that the president has laid out.""

Earnest did leave open the possibility that the new language could repeal the 2002 AUMF that President Bush secured from Congress before he began his war in Iraq. ""I think the president has made the case previously that he does support the repeal of the 2002 AUMF,"" Earnest said. ""And this is in the context of a speech that he gave a year or two ago talking about the need to review some of these policies that have the unintended effect of keeping the United States on sort of this permanent war footing.""

Earnest did not say if Obama would also seek repeal of the 2001 AUMF that he is currently using to justify his own bombing campaign in Iraq.",www.townhall.com,right,j8YtReK9pnhGAmET

The cold and snow that walloped Washington overnight didn't stop Ashton Carter from reporting for work Tuesday. Carter was sworn in as the 25th U.S. Secretary of Defense after starting his day with meetings at the Pentagon.

Sworn in by Vice President Biden at the White House Tuesday, Carter formally replaces Chuck Hagel, becoming President Obama's fourth defense chief in the past six years.

Carter's debut at the Pentagon this morning was briefly interrupted when his wife, Stephanie, ""slipped and fell on the icy pavement,"" the AP reports. ""She laughed it off, and officials indicated she was not injured.""

In taking the Pentagon's top job, Carter rounds out a career that has included several stints with the Department of Defense, from leading the acquisitions unit to being deputy defense secretary.

NPR's John Burnett gives an overview of Carter's biography:

""Ashton Carter is 60 years old; he's a Yale graduate and was a Rhodes Scholar in theoretical physics at Oxford. He never served in the military; he was a long-time faculty member of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, and he's the author or co-author of 11 books.""

USA TODAY

The U.S. flew two strategic bombers over the Korean Peninsula on Saturday in response to North Korea's latest ballistic missile test and nuclear threat.

Two B-1B Lancer bombers from Guam's Anderson Air Base flew over the Peninsula for precision-strike training, the U.S. Pacific Air Forces said in a statement. The training session, a 10-hour bilateral mission with Japanese and South Korean fighter jets, comes days after North Korea test-launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile.

“North Korea’s actions are a threat to our allies, partners and homeland,” said Gen. Terrence O’ Shaughnessy, Pacific Air Forces commander. “Let me be clear, if called upon we are trained, equipped and ready to unleash the full lethal capability of our allied air forces.”

defense,Daily Beast,0,http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/03/05/new-player-in-the-isis-war-christian-gazillionaire-foster-friess.html,New Player in the ISIS War: Christian Gazillionaire Foster Friess,2015-03-05,Tim Mak,"Republican megadonor Foster Friess is shifting his sights from political campaigns to a military campaign : to fight ISIS and save Kurdish lives .
Behind the scenes , the conservative Christian has been traveling to the Middle East to support the vulnerable Kurdish minority in Iraq , and then coming back to the U.S. to lobby for arming and training their militias , known as the Peshmerga . These forces are on the front lines of the war with ISIS .
“ They are fighting our fight and we have treated them disgracefully in terms of the armaments we have provided . Not only am I embarrassed to be an American , I ’ m actually ashamed , ” Friess told The ███ . Arming the Kurds , he added , would help “ defeat a ghastly evil that is running amok . ”
Some pro-Kurdish advocates have interpreted Friess ’ s interest to mean that he wants to raise a volunteer military force to aid the Kurds , or arm them through private funds . But Friess told The ███ that is not on the table , at least not for now .
One of his informal advisers , retired U.S. Army Brig . Gen. Ernie Audino , seem to be singing from a slightly different hymnal .
“ There is no reason why this monopoly [ for equipping ] should be owned by the U.S. government . I think there ’ s a role for private organizations to generate private support to help the Kurds , ” said Audino , who as a soldier was stationed in Kurdistan for a year . “ Foster and I are certainly talking about it , in concept… No one ’ s pulled the trigger on it . ”
Last November , Friess traveled to the front lines of the Kurdish battle with ISIS , visiting a Peshmerga military camp called “ Black Tiger . ”
“ When I visited Camp Black Tiger I was amazed to see how many of the fighters had come out of retirement and were in their 40s and 50s , ” Friess said . “ I had tears in my eyes to see the Yazidis [ an ethnic minority ] ... as I passed out 5,000 blankets to them which our family had purchased from Turkey . To think they had to leave their homes and everything they owned and only had the clothes on their backs was indeed sad . ”
Friess is primarily known for funding socially conservative causes , including hundreds of thousands of dollars to former Sen. Rick Santorum ’ s last presidential run . He spent more than a million on Koch-related causes , and six figures to Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker ’ s 2012 recall campaign .
He backs all that with a net worth The Wall Street Journal has estimated at just north of half a billion dollars .
But Friess is no stranger to controversy , having stirred up outrage on the left during the 2012 presidential campaign when , as a prominent backer of Rick Santorum , the 74-year-old said that women in his day put aspirin “ between their knees ” as contraception .
More disturbing , perhaps , is the fact that Friess ’ s website promotes books by well-known Islamophobes like Frank Gaffney and Robert Spencer , who helped inspire Norweigan mass murderer and terrorist Anders Breivik . ( Although , it should be noted , the website also promotes moderate Islamic groups . )
In the Capitol , Friess has pressed lawmakers to expand airstrikes against ISIS , to help train and equip the Peshmerga , and expand humanitarian aid . He is also insistent on a rhetorical change : that politicians stop referring to the “ war on terror. ” Instead , he wants the world to take arms against the “ global jihadist movement . ”
The Kurdish military wish list is long , reflecting the nature of its grinding , daily fight with ISIS . They want counter-IED tools , anti-tank weapons , mine-resistant vehicles , and surveillance equipment .
“ [ Friess is ] shooting for practical targets . What ’ s the most practical target right now ? The easiest target right now is , let ’ s help the United States directly equip the Kurds , ” said Brig . Gen. Audino , who serves as an informal adviser to Friess on Kurdish issues . “ He has a genuinely good heart , and he wants to stay on the right side of history… He sees the awful slaughter of innocents in Iraq and Syria right now . He doesn ’ t see that ending at Iraqi and Syrian borders . ”
ISIS could be pushed back , Friess said , if the United States would provide the Kurds with “ Apache helicopters and tanks and anti-tank weapons , ” as well as a more aggressive air campaign .
Some have interpreted the multimillionaire ’ s support for the Kurds as openness to privately funding their cause . Last month , an email from Friess to Sen. Rand Paul was leaked to the Washington Examiner ’ s David Drucker . In it , Friess urges Paul to support the Kurds . In particular , he asked the White House hopeful whether he ’ d support raising a force to aid their fight .
“ Would you support a volunteer force from our military or contractors ? I received a request from 2,000 young Christian men for help in training and arming . They want to protect their vulnerable , unprotected Christian community 30 miles from ISIS , ” Friess wrote .
Audino , the retired general , said that while the businessman ’ s primary effort was to get the American government to directly arm the Kurds , they have talked about privately doing so as well , hypothetically .
Small wonder that rumors have been spreading among anti-ISIS Westerners that Friess could soon be bankrolling their efforts . Matthew VanDyke runs a security contracting firm called Sons of Liberty International in Iraq , which provides free military training to local Christians in Kurdish and Iraqi areas . He said he had heard that Friess “ pledged to help fund the Peshmerga , ” and had been looking to get in touch with him ever since .
But asked directly about it , Friess said he was not considering privately raising , training and equipping a militia to defend embattled Christians and Kurds in Iraq and Syria . He wouldn ’ t comment on the request that he received from the thousands of Christian men that he referenced in the email to Sen. Paul .
The scale of the problem , he said , makes a solution too large to privately finance .
“ Do you realize the enormity of what it takes to defeat the enemy ? I ’ m not in the business of financing private armies , ” Friess told The ███ .
Friess ’ s interest in the Kurds can at least in part be explained by his Christian faith , or as the businessman put it , when he “ invited Jesus to become the Chairman of the Board of my life . ”
American Christians have been generally supportive of the Kurds due to their role in protecting Christians in post-Saddam Iraq . Evangelical figures like former Arkansas Gov . Mike Huckabee and Pat Robertson have touted the secular Kurds for their protection of Middle Eastern Christian communities . Though there has historically been animus between Kurds and Christians in the region , there has been in contemporary times a confluence of interests .
“ The Kurds have been seen as protectors of the Christians , especially since the fall of Saddam in 2003 , when the Christians began to be pushed out of and even murdered in Arab Iraq . By contrast the Christians have been thriving in the Kurdish region of Iraq , ” said Professor Michael Gunter , who has written 11 books on the Kurdish people .
Since the proclamation of a so-called Islamic State last year , outside players have jumped into the ISIS war .

The legislation has not yet been introduced .","Republican megadonor Foster Friess is shifting his sights from political campaigns to a military campaign: to fight ISIS and save Kurdish lives.

Behind the scenes, the conservative Christian has been traveling to the Middle East to support the vulnerable Kurdish minority in Iraq, and then coming back to the U.S. to lobby for arming and training their militias, known as the Peshmerga. These forces are on the front lines of the war with ISIS.

“They are fighting our fight and we have treated them disgracefully in terms of the armaments we have provided. Not only am I embarrassed to be an American, I’m actually ashamed,” Friess told The Daily Beast. Arming the Kurds, he added, would help “defeat a ghastly evil that is running amok.”

Some pro-Kurdish advocates have interpreted Friess’s interest to mean that he wants to raise a volunteer military force to aid the Kurds, or arm them through private funds. But Friess told The Daily Beast that is not on the table, at least not for now.

One of his informal advisers, retired U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Ernie Audino, seem to be singing from a slightly different hymnal.

“There is no reason why this monopoly [for equipping] should be owned by the U.S. government. I think there’s a role for private organizations to generate private support to help the Kurds,” said Audino, who as a soldier was stationed in Kurdistan for a year. “Foster and I are certainly talking about it, in concept… No one’s pulled the trigger on it.”

Last November, Friess traveled to the front lines of the Kurdish battle with ISIS, visiting a Peshmerga military camp called “Black Tiger.”

“When I visited Camp Black Tiger I was amazed to see how many of the fighters had come out of retirement and were in their 40s and 50s,” Friess said. “I had tears in my eyes to see the Yazidis [an ethnic minority]... as I passed out 5,000 blankets to them which our family had purchased from Turkey. To think they had to leave their homes and everything they owned and only had the clothes on their backs was indeed sad.”

Friess is primarily known for funding socially conservative causes, including hundreds of thousands of dollars to former Sen. Rick Santorum’s last presidential run. He spent more than a million on Koch-related causes, and six figures to Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s 2012 recall campaign.

He backs all that with a net worth The Wall Street Journal has estimated at just north of half a billion dollars.

But Friess is no stranger to controversy, having stirred up outrage on the left during the 2012 presidential campaign when, as a prominent backer of Rick Santorum, the 74-year-old said that women in his day put aspirin “between their knees” as contraception.

More disturbing, perhaps, is the fact that Friess’s website promotes books by well-known Islamophobes like Frank Gaffney and Robert Spencer, who helped inspire Norweigan mass murderer and terrorist Anders Breivik. (Although, it should be noted, the website also promotes moderate Islamic groups.)

In the Capitol, Friess has pressed lawmakers to expand airstrikes against ISIS, to help train and equip the Peshmerga, and expand humanitarian aid. He is also insistent on a rhetorical change: that politicians stop referring to the “war on terror.” Instead, he wants the world to take arms against the “global jihadist movement.”

The Kurdish military wish list is long, reflecting the nature of its grinding, daily fight with ISIS. They want counter-IED tools, anti-tank weapons, mine-resistant vehicles, and surveillance equipment.

“[Friess is] shooting for practical targets. What’s the most practical target right now? The easiest target right now is, let’s help the United States directly equip the Kurds,” said Brig. Gen. Audino, who serves as an informal adviser to Friess on Kurdish issues. “He has a genuinely good heart, and he wants to stay on the right side of history… He sees the awful slaughter of innocents in Iraq and Syria right now. He doesn’t see that ending at Iraqi and Syrian borders.”

ISIS could be pushed back, Friess said, if the United States would provide the Kurds with “Apache helicopters and tanks and anti-tank weapons,” as well as a more aggressive air campaign.

Some have interpreted the multimillionaire’s support for the Kurds as openness to privately funding their cause. Last month, an email from Friess to Sen. Rand Paul was leaked to the Washington Examiner’s David Drucker. In it, Friess urges Paul to support the Kurds. In particular, he asked the White House hopeful whether he’d support raising a force to aid their fight.

“Would you support a volunteer force from our military or contractors? I received a request from 2,000 young Christian men for help in training and arming. They want to protect their vulnerable, unprotected Christian community 30 miles from ISIS,” Friess wrote.

Audino, the retired general, said that while the businessman’s primary effort was to get the American government to directly arm the Kurds, they have talked about privately doing so as well, hypothetically.

Small wonder that rumors have been spreading among anti-ISIS Westerners that Friess could soon be bankrolling their efforts. Matthew VanDyke runs a security contracting firm called Sons of Liberty International in Iraq, which provides free military training to local Christians in Kurdish and Iraqi areas. He said he had heard that Friess “pledged to help fund the Peshmerga,” and had been looking to get in touch with him ever since.

But asked directly about it, Friess said he was not considering privately raising, training and equipping a militia to defend embattled Christians and Kurds in Iraq and Syria. He wouldn’t comment on the request that he received from the thousands of Christian men that he referenced in the email to Sen. Paul.

The scale of the problem, he said, makes a solution too large to privately finance.

“Do you realize the enormity of what it takes to defeat the enemy? I’m not in the business of financing private armies,” Friess told The Daily Beast.

Friess’s interest in the Kurds can at least in part be explained by his Christian faith, or as the businessman put it, when he “invited Jesus to become the Chairman of the Board of my life.”

American Christians have been generally supportive of the Kurds due to their role in protecting Christians in post-Saddam Iraq. Evangelical figures like former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Pat Robertson have touted the secular Kurds for their protection of Middle Eastern Christian communities. Though there has historically been animus between Kurds and Christians in the region, there has been in contemporary times a confluence of interests.

“The Kurds have been seen as protectors of the Christians, especially since the fall of Saddam in 2003, when the Christians began to be pushed out of and even murdered in Arab Iraq. By contrast the Christians have been thriving in the Kurdish region of Iraq,” said Professor Michael Gunter, who has written 11 books on the Kurdish people.

Since the proclamation of a so-called Islamic State last year, outside players have jumped into the ISIS war. From Saudi to Iranian involvement, from American military veterans looking for freelance work to Western jihadists looking for a battle to join, outsiders have flooded into the region for one cause or another.

If a high-profile Christian American businessman were to privately fund weapons in the ISIS battlespace, it would be a problematic foray into an already-nasty sectarian situation. So far Friess has stayed away from that role. While the Kurds welcome any help they can get from Christian Americans, ISIS has framed its war as one of them versus the “crusaders.”

In January, for example, ISIS urged its followers in the West to “to target the crusaders in their own lands and wherever they are found.”

The money Friess has thus far spent on the Kurdish cause has been slight, as compared to his financial commitments to political candidates. He spent some $50,000 on blankets as humanitarian aid to the Yazidis, another minority group in Iraq.

Awat Mustafa, who works at a Kurdish humanitarian aid group called the Barzani Charity Foundation, met Friess during the National Prayer Breakfast this year. Friess invited Mustafa to his office, and they’ve been tossing ideas back and forth ever since. Mustafa said he submitted a funding proposal, for humanitarian assistance to the millions of refugees in Kurdish areas, and hopes to get funding in the realm of six figures or more.

“I'm sure he’s going to be one of our big donors, no doubt about it,” Mustafa said. “In the past he has already donated some money for refugees in the Kurdistan region.”

Perhaps Friess’s most impactful effort for the Kurds has been in using his weight to press Congress to help them. Foster has wielded his influence to lobby lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to support Kurdish militias, including such figures as Democratic lawmakers Sen. Harry Reid and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.

“Foster Friess agrees with me on this issue—in order for there to be military success on the ground and defeat ISIS, the U.S. must provide the heavy weapons and arms directly to trusted fighters, such as the Kurds,” Gabbard said.

On the Republican side, Friess’s role is praised.

“He’s a good friend of the Kurds, and he’s made a real difference. He’s provided his own money, among other things… and had an effect on opinion here [in the Senate]. He’s one of their strongest advocates,” Sen. John McCain told The Daily Beast.

Added Sen. Lindsey Graham: “He’s gotten to know the Kurds well. He’s very passionate.”

And there may be some coming legislative efforts: Sen. John Barrasso, Gabbard and others huddled with Friess in Graham’s conference room last month to work on a bill called the Kurdish Emergency Relief Act, the Washington Examiner reported, which would involve some $500 million in aid for the Kurdish people.

Washington (CNN) – The number of innocent victims of drone strikes remains ""extremely small"" and doesn't outweigh the benefits of using drones to take out al Qaeda operatives, former Defense Secretary Robert Gates argued Sunday.

Mattis’s departure will leave the Trump administration more chaotic

Perhaps even worse, the president also kept Mattis out of the loop on other major military announcements, including halting military exercises with South Korea and banning transgender troops from the military. (Trump announced the latter while Mattis was on vacation.)

Mattis did have a few notable successes, though. He reportedly stopped Trump from ordering the assassination of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, a move that would’ve escalated Syria’s brutal civil war and brought the US much deeper into the conflict.

He also ensured the Trump stuck to a diplomatic approach with North Korea rather than a military one. And he convinced Trump that torture was a bad idea.

President Barack Obama’s defense to Democratic senators complaining about how little his administration has told Congress about the legal justifications for his drone policy: Dick Cheney was worse.

That’s part of what two senators in the room recounted of Obama’s response when, near the outset of his closed-door session with the Senate Democratic conference on Tuesday, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.) confronted the president over the administration’s refusal for two years to show congressional intelligence committees Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel memos justifying the use of lethal force against American terror suspects abroad.

Story Continued Below

Obama recently allowed members of those panels to see the memos, but only after senators in both parties threatened to hold up the confirmation of John Brennan as Central Intelligence Agency director. Brennan was confirmed last week, but lawmakers not on one of the intelligence panels are still being denied access to the memos and several are steamed over being frozen out.

In response to Rockefeller’s critique, Obama said he’s not involved in drafting such memos, the senators told POLITICO. He also tried to assure his former colleagues that his administration is more open to oversight than that of President George W. Bush, whom many Democratic senators attacked for secrecy and for expanding executive power in the national security realm.

“This is not Dick Cheney we’re talking about here,” he said, according to Democratic senators who asked not to be named discussing the private meeting.

Two Obama administration officials, who asked not to be named, confirmed Rockefeller raised the drone oversight issue with the president at the session. The White House had no comment on Obama’s alleged reference to the former vice president.

While Obama defended his handling of the issue, he told his former Senate colleagues he understood their concerns about being left out of the loop on such sensitive decisions, senators said. The president noted that he would have “probably objected” over the White House’s handling of this issue if he were still a senator, they said. But, according to the sources, he noted his viewpoint changed now that he occupies the Oval Office — not a room in a Senate office building.

defense,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/feb/7/john-brennan-defends-fatal-drone-strikes/,"Defiant John Brennan: ""No recourse except drone strikes to kill suspected terrorists""",2013-02-07,Shaun Waterman,"John O. Brennan , President Obama ’ s pick to lead the CIA , defended the administration ’ s drone execution program before Congress on Thursday , saying that in war the commander in chief has the right to order a targeted killing — but agreeing that Congress should be more involved in knowing what is happening .
Mr. Brennan , who is Mr. Obama ’ s homeland security adviser and is considered one of the key architects of the war on terrorism in recent years , also said he is not sure whether interrogation techniques such as waterboarding produced any valuable information from suspected terrorist detainees .
In a hearing interrupted repeatedly by anti-war protesters , Mr. Brennan denied he had leaked classified information to reporters and told the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that he will try to work with Capitol Hill so that lawmakers are aware of the administration ’ s operations in the war on terrorism .
Senators homed in on targeted killings by armed unmanned aerial vehicles , begun under President George W. Bush and dramatically expanded by Mr. Obama . The drone program has come under scrutiny after the Obama administration used it to kill an American citizen living in Yemen .
“ I understand you can ’ t have co-commanders in chief , but having the executive being the prosecutor , the judge , the jury and the executioner all in one is very contrary to the traditions and the laws of this country , ” said Sen. Angus S. King Jr. , Maine independent .
Mr. Brennan replied that this was not a judicial proceeding .
“ The actions that we take on the counterterrorism front , again , are to take actions against individuals where we believe that the intelligence base is so strong and the nature of the threat is so grave and serious , as well as imminent , that we have no recourse except to take this action that may involve a lethal strike , ” he said .
With some senators threatening to delay Mr. Brennan ’ s nomination to be CIA director until more information is disclosed , the White House late Wednesday said it would provide to the committee legal memos detailing advice about the drone program .
NBC News this week obtained and released a 16-page Justice Department memo laying out the legal justification for the program .
Three Americans are known to have been killed by the program — all of them in Yemen and all by missile strikes from drones .
The three are radical Islamic preacher Anwar al-Awlaki , a senior leader in al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) ; his 16-year-old son , Abdulrahman al-Awlaki ; and AQAP propagandist Samir Khan .
U.S. officials have said that al-Awlaki was targeted directly only because he had an “ operational role ” in recruiting and training suicide terrorists including the Nigerian would-be “ underwear bomber ” Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab . The other two were killed in strikes targeting other AQAP leaders .
Several Republicans closely questioned Mr. Brennan about leaks to the news media regarding Obama administration national security successes . Mr. Brennan denied that he was the source of any of them .
“ I never provided classified information to reporters , ” Mr. Brennan said . He added that his contacts with the news media were arranged by the White House press office and aimed at explaining administration policy .
Sen. Ron Wyden , Oregon Democrat , told the hearing that Congress , and eventually the American public , needed to see the documents outlining the legal basis for the targeted-killing program .
“ We ’ ve got to see any and all opinions before the vote ” on the nomination , Mr. Wyden said .
He also called for the legal opinions to be made public so that Americans could judge for themselves the exact extent of the authority President Obama asserts to kill U.S. citizens without charge or trial if they are senior al Qaeda leaders who can not be captured .
“ What it really goes to is the issue of checks and balances , ” he said .
Mr. King asked Mr. Brennan to allow the judicial branch to oversee targeted killings of U.S. citizens , as it authorized intelligence surveillance against Americans , through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) court — a secret tribunal that grants warrants for the electronic and physical surveillance of Americans suspected of espionage or terrorism .
“ I would like to suggest to you that you consider a FISA court-type process , where an American citizen is going to be targeted for a lethal strike , ” Mr. King told Mr. Brennan .
“ At least that would be some check , ” Mr. King said . “ I have great confidence in you . I have great confidence in President Obama . But all the lessons of history are , it shouldn ’ t matter who ’ s in charge , because we should have procedures and processes in place that will protect us . ”
Some Republicans asked Mr. Brennan whether the administration ’ s expanded use of the lethal strikes by remotely piloted drone aircraft grew from its decision to abjure the capture , detention and harsh interrogation techniques employed by the Bush administration .
“ Is your testimony today that the huge increase in the number of lethal strikes has no connection to the change in the Obama administration ’ s detention policy ? ” said Sen. Susan M. Collins , Maine Republican . “ Because obviously , if we ’ re capturing a terrorist , we have the opportunity to interrogate that individual and perhaps learn of ongoing plots . But if the strike is done , that opportunity is lost . ”
“ There ’ s never been occasion that I ’ m aware of where we had the opportunity to capture a terrorist and we didn ’ t and we decided to take a lethal strike , ” replied Mr. Brennan . “ So certainly there is no correlation there . ”
He added that the expanding use of drones was in part a result of “ the maturation of capabilities and insights into [ al Qaeda ] plots as a result of the investment that was made in the previous administration . ”
Other Republicans focused on questioning Mr. Brennan about administration leaks to the media .
“ I engaged in discussions with reporters about classified issues that they might have had access to because of unfortunate leaks of classified information , and I frequently work with reporters , if not editors of newspapers , to keep out of the public domain some of this country ’ s most important secrets , ” Mr. Brennan said .
“ Whenever I deal with reporters , I do so at the request of the White House press office and they set the ground rules , ” he said .
He said that he voluntary cooperated with the Department of Justice investigation into the leak of information about a double agent inside al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) who helped U.S. and allied agencies foil an underwear bomb plot .
Mr. Brennan said he had “ been interviewed on it ” and his office turned over “ all relevant materials , ” including any notes of the conference call .
He denied that a statement he made in a conference call with former officials last year about the plot had compromised intelligence sources and methods .
The call had been arranged because the former officials were all going on news programs to discuss the foiling of the plot , which targeted U.S. aviation .
Mr. Brennan said , in a statement later repeated publicly by several of the former officials , that the United States had “ inside control ” of the plot and that the underwear bomb was never a threat to American aviation .
Later that day , news agencies broke the story that an a U.S. allied agency had an agent inside the AQAP cell planning the bombing .
Mr. Brennan said he needed to explain that the U.S. had “ inside control , ” because during the time of the plot — around the first anniversary of the Navy SEAL raid on Osama bin Laden ’ s compound in Pakistan — he and other officials had reassured that there was no specific actionable intelligence about threats or plots .
“ We had said publicly that there was no active plot at the time of the bin Laden anniversary , ” he said .
Mr. Brennan is a 25-year career intelligence officer who served in the Bush administration as the first head of the National Counterterrorism Center . In 2008 , he was a close adviser to Mr. Obama in the Senate .","John O. Brennan, President Obama’s pick to lead the CIA, defended the administration’s drone execution program before Congress on Thursday, saying that in war the commander in chief has the right to order a targeted killing — but agreeing that Congress should be more involved in knowing what is happening.

Mr. Brennan, who is Mr. Obama’s homeland security adviser and is considered one of the key architects of the war on terrorism in recent years, also said he is not sure whether interrogation techniques such as waterboarding produced any valuable information from suspected terrorist detainees.

In a hearing interrupted repeatedly by anti-war protesters, Mr. Brennan denied he had leaked classified information to reporters and told the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that he will try to work with Capitol Hill so that lawmakers are aware of the administration’s operations in the war on terrorism.

Senators homed in on targeted killings by armed unmanned aerial vehicles, begun under President George W. Bush and dramatically expanded by Mr. Obama. The drone program has come under scrutiny after the Obama administration used it to kill an American citizen living in Yemen.

“I understand you can’t have co-commanders in chief, but having the executive being the prosecutor, the judge, the jury and the executioner all in one is very contrary to the traditions and the laws of this country,” said Sen. Angus S. King Jr., Maine independent.

Mr. Brennan replied that this was not a judicial proceeding.

“The actions that we take on the counterterrorism front, again, are to take actions against individuals where we believe that the intelligence base is so strong and the nature of the threat is so grave and serious, as well as imminent, that we have no recourse except to take this action that may involve a lethal strike,” he said.

With some senators threatening to delay Mr. Brennan’s nomination to be CIA director until more information is disclosed, the White House late Wednesday said it would provide to the committee legal memos detailing advice about the drone program.

NBC News this week obtained and released a 16-page Justice Department memo laying out the legal justification for the program.

Three Americans are known to have been killed by the program — all of them in Yemen and all by missile strikes from drones.

The three are radical Islamic preacher Anwar al-Awlaki, a senior leader in al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP); his 16-year-old son, Abdulrahman al-Awlaki; and AQAP propagandist Samir Khan.

U.S. officials have said that al-Awlaki was targeted directly only because he had an “operational role” in recruiting and training suicide terrorists including the Nigerian would-be “underwear bomber” Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab. The other two were killed in strikes targeting other AQAP leaders.

Several Republicans closely questioned Mr. Brennan about leaks to the news media regarding Obama administration national security successes. Mr. Brennan denied that he was the source of any of them.

“I never provided classified information to reporters,” Mr. Brennan said. He added that his contacts with the news media were arranged by the White House press office and aimed at explaining administration policy.

Sen. Ron Wyden, Oregon Democrat, told the hearing that Congress, and eventually the American public, needed to see the documents outlining the legal basis for the targeted-killing program.

“We’ve got to see any and all opinions before the vote” on the nomination, Mr. Wyden said.

He also called for the legal opinions to be made public so that Americans could judge for themselves the exact extent of the authority President Obama asserts to kill U.S. citizens without charge or trial if they are senior al Qaeda leaders who cannot be captured.

“What it really goes to is the issue of checks and balances,” he said.

Mr. King asked Mr. Brennan to allow the judicial branch to oversee targeted killings of U.S. citizens, as it authorized intelligence surveillance against Americans, through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court — a secret tribunal that grants warrants for the electronic and physical surveillance of Americans suspected of espionage or terrorism.

Leading Republicans in the Senate and House have been calling on the State Department to identify the injured and make them available to congressional investigators. So far, they say their calls have gone unanswered.

Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, said the administration has provided ""zero"" documents on the matter and has not provided names of those attacked.

Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., has gathered about 60 signatures in support of a select committee to investigate the Benghazi terrorist attack. Wolf has said the committee is the most thorough and efficient approach to resolving the lingering underlying questions rather than the competing and overlapping committee jurisdictions.

Wolf, along with Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., and leading Senate Republicans Graham, John McCain of Arizona, and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire have pressed the State Department for answers.

President Obama will on Monday name former Sen. Chuck Hagel to be his next defense secretary, an administration official confirmed to NPR.

The former Republican senator from Nebraska is a Vietnam veteran. He would succeed Leon Panetta, who is retiring.

Our original post follows:

Republican senators say former Sen. Chuck Hagel can expect a tough nominating process if President Obama names him to be the next defense secretary.

""I'm going to take a look at all the things that Chuck has said over the years and review that,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Sunday on ABC's This Week.

As NPR's Tom Bowman reported last week, Hagel would be the first former enlisted soldier to run the Pentagon. He would succeed Leon Panetta.

According to The Washington Post and other news organizations, Obama will nominate Hagel on Monday. The former Republican senator's past comments on Iran, Israel and gays have come under scrutiny.

Here's more from The Associated Press:

""Hagel has criticized discussion of a military strike by either the U.S. or Israel against Iran. He also has backed efforts to bring Iran to the table for talks on future peace in Afghanistan. Some lawmakers have been troubled by his comments and actions on Israel, including his reference to the 'Jewish lobby' in the United States.""

McConnell said any defense nominee must have ""a full understanding of our close relationship with our Israeli allies, the Iranian threat, and the importance of having a robust military.""

The comments were echoed by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.

""This is an in-your-face nomination by the president to all of us who are supportive of Israel,"" Graham said on CNN's State of the Union. ""I don't know what his management experience is regarding the Pentagon — little, if any, so I think it's an incredibly controversial choice.""

But speaking on the same program, Sen. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, called Hagel ""a serious candidate if the president chooses to name him.""

Obama himself has defended Hagel from the criticism on NBC's Meet the Press last week, calling him ""a patriot.""",www.npr.org,center,VArECesPBFmvZv0w

The reformers — an alliance of watchdog activists , technocrats and former government auditors — have long bemoaned the delays and cost overruns that plague the Pentagon ’ s procurement of ships , guns and planes .
Now , President-elect Donald Trump seems to have joined them . He has taken to Twitter to blast the titans of defense contracting for what he sees as overpriced weapons , suggesting a procurement overhaul may be a top priority to Defense Secretary-nominee James N. Mattis .
“ To say the least , we are a bit stunned , albeit pleasantly so , ” said Thomas P. Christie , the Pentagon ’ s former top weapons tester who has long advocated lower-cost alternatives .
Mr. Trump met Dec. 21 at his Mar-a-Lago mansion in Palm Beach , Florida , with senior officers who will oversee the procurement side of a $ 619 billion defense budget this year .
Before the Florida summit , Mr. Trump tweeted a cancellation warning to Boeing Co. about the long-term costs of two new Air Force One planes . Then he took on the costliest weapon system in U.S. history : the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II . The procurement history of the joint strike fighter jet is so pocked with trouble that Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain , Arizona Republican , has called it a “ scandal and tragedy . ”
Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing rank No . 1 and No . 2 , respectively , as the Defense Department ’ s largest contractors based on revenue , according to Defense News .
If there is a networking headquarters for the military reform movement , it would be the Project On Government Oversight in Washington . For years , POGO has exposed defense industry malpractice while promoting what it sees as less-costly weapons options .
Dan Grazier , a former Marine captain who joined POGO in 2015 as a budget and weapons analyst , said he is “ cautiously optimistic ” about Mr. Trump ’ s tilt toward Pentagon reforms .
“ It ’ s refreshing to hear someone taking on the military-industrial-congressional complex this way , because this is something we haven ’ t seen for many , many , many years , ” Mr. Grazier said . “ The fact that he ’ s able to at least get Boeing and Lockheed working to reduce cost , it ’ s a good shot across the bow . But there ’ s a big difference between words and action . He ’ s talking a really good game now . Now let ’ s see if he can actually translate it into action . ”
Winslow Wheeler , a longtime reformer government auditor and Senate aide , said it ’ s impossible to predict what actions Mr. Trump will take but that the right path is a “ drain the swamp ” option of canceling the F-35 and building separate replacements for the A-10 close-air support jet used effectively against the Islamic State group , as well as follow-ons for the Navy F-18 Hornet and the Air Force F-16 .
A big complaint from reformers is that the F-35 was doomed to cost explosions from the start because Les Aspin , defense secretary at the time , decided to make it a “ joint ” fighter — a single aircraft to serve the various and specific needs of the Air Force , Navy and Marine Corps .
Reformers say Lockheed ’ s F-16 Falcon is perhaps the most successful fighter program in history because the Pentagon forced the Air Force to design and build it only to its specifications . To a certain extent , the same holds true for the Navy and its carrier-based F-18 .
The defense industry and its many supporters on Capitol Hill generally got what they wanted during a decade and a half in the war on Islamic terrorism . With weapons systems wearing out , even programs such as the $ 379 billion F-35 , with its myriad problems , won the budget battle every year .
But their serenity was shattered by a White House-congressional budget deal known as “ sequestration , ” or mandatory spending cuts .
“ The F-35 program and cost is out of control , ” he tweeted on Dec. 12 . “ Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military ( and other ) purchases after January 20th . ”
Ten days later , the president-elect met with Boeing ’ s CEO and announced via Twitter that he asked the company to price its F-18 Super Hornet as a possible competitor to the F-35 .
On paper , the F-35 ’ s stealth , a 360-degree-vision helmet , and advanced software make the single-engine jet more capable than the twin-engine Hornet . But some Navy leaders said their service branch was left out of the expensive F-35 development in favor of continuing buys of the F-18 Super Hornet . The motive : The savings could be used to build more ships .
Boeing has not escaped Mr. Trump ’ s wrath . He flatly threatened to cancel plans to build two Air Force One craft slated for completion in 2022 . “ Costs are out of control , more than $ 4 billion . Cancel order ! ” he tweeted .
The Government Accountability Office estimates the development and procurement costs at $ 3 billion for what are essentially flying White Houses . The 747s will come with grand living quarters , advanced communications , defensive systems and avionics technology .
Mr. Trump ’ s $ 4 billion figure may include what are called “ life cycle costs ” from the program ’ s beginning through its service life , with repairs , new parts and maintenance .
The GAO and Pentagon testers have documented the F-35 ’ s cost overruns , production delays and performance shortfalls for nearly a decade .
Planners for the Air Force , Navy and Marine Corps were wildly off base when predicting its price and schedule . The $ 379 billion total acquisition cost is double their initial estimates . The military was supposed to be flying more than 1,000 F-35s by now but has received fewer than 200 .
In April , GAO examiners concluded that the F-35 may not be affordable because budget restraints limit yearly production , driving up per-plane costs . Soon , the Pentagon will need to spend more than $ 12 billion a year on procurement until 2038 to purchase 2,457 planes .
“ It is unlikely the program will be able to sustain such a high level of annual funding and if required funding levels are not reached , the program ’ s procurement plan may not be affordable , ” the GAO said .
Mr. McCain subsequently summoned the F-35 brain trust to a Senate hearing .
“ Aircraft deliveries amount to no more than a mere trickle relative to the original promises of the program , ” said Mr. McCain , who served as a Navy fighter pilot in Vietnam . “ Because the Air Force , Marines and Navy were all counting on the F-35s that never appeared , combat aircraft and strike fighter capacity shortfalls in all three services have reached critical levels , severely impacting readiness . ”
The few F-35s that have reached the services were operationally flawed . Mr. McCain had a list : “ They have problems with maintenance diagnostic software , radar instabilities , sensor fusion shortfalls , fuel system problems , structural cracks from service life testing , engine reliability deficits , limitations on the crew escape system that cause pilot weight restrictions , and potential cyber vulnerabilities . This list is as troubling as it is long . ”
Mr. Grazier said the F-35 is an example of “ political engineering , ” creating such broad grass-roots support that lawmakers do not dare vote against it .
“ Contracts for the F-35 have been spread across the 45 states , ” he said . “ We estimate around 350 different congressional districts all over the country . So that is a lot of political support on Capitol Hill . Overcoming that is going to be a very difficult endeavor . ”
Mr. Grazier would like the Trump administration to stop buying F-35s at least until initial tests and evaluations are completed to rule out even more defects . Lockheed built the F-35 concurrently , meaning the plane ’ s development overlapped its production .
The reality is the F-35 program , begun 20 years ago , is so big and the fighter jets are so needed in the field that outright cancellation is unlikely . Eight NATO countries are partners with Lockheed . The Air Force and Marine Corps have declared initial operational capability for their deliveries .
But contracts with Lockheed Martin are negotiated at certain production stages , meaning Mr. Trump ’ s “ Art of the Deal ” approach may come into play to lower the price .
“ It ’ s great that Donald Trump is having all the other execs in the defense industry sort of hopping to his tune , but the reality is Congress gets a vote on this , ” Mr. Grazier said .
How true . For all the complaints , Congress increased the buy from 63 F-35s requested by President Obama to 74 in this year ’ s budget .
Reformers wonder who among Mr. Trump ’ s advisers is steering his focus to costly weapons . One Trump supporter said people should remember that Mr. Trump has spent his business career negotiating prices , including for his own airplanes .
“ Who is whispering in his ear ? ” said Mr. Christie , who was in charge of weapons testing in President George W. Bush ’ s first term . “ Surely , he hasn ’ t come down this hard strictly on his own . However he has come to issuing these tweets , he has certainly picked deserving fiascoes , especially the F-35 . It will be interesting to see if his administration goes after these ‘ out of control ’ programs after Jan. 20 . We are hopeful Mattis will be more than happy to follow through to crack down and , hopefully , roll back both the F-35 and Air Force One , as well as turn his attention to other debacles . ”
Mr. Christie mentioned the Navy ’ s littoral combat ship and aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford as other major programs that need the Trump treatment .
One of the top brass who visited Mr. Trump at Mar-a-Lago was Air Force Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan , who runs the F-35 program office . Whether he changed Mr. Trump ’ s mind is unclear .
Days later , Gen. Bogdan met with reporters to assert that the plane ’ s major problems had been eliminated .
“ This program is not out of control , ” Gen. Bogdan said , according to Bloomberg News . “ Since 2011 , we have basically been on schedule . Since 2011 , we have basically been on budget . ”
The history is , he said : “ We put unrealistic schedules and budgets together . And then when we ran into problems we did not manage them very well . ”
The program office says the total acquisition cost has decreased since 2014 from $ 400 billion to $ 379 billion .","Military reformers in the nation’s capital may have found a soul mate in a billionaire real estate magnate who takes a keen interest in what things cost, including big weapons systems.

President Obama on Thursday signed the bipartisan budget bill agreed upon earlier this month, setting the stage for an easing of mandatory spending cuts over the next two years.

The Senate approved the spending measure last week, following its passage in the Republican-dominated House.

The president also signed the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2014.

As The Associated Press reports:

""Obama signed the bill Thursday while vacationing in Hawaii. The deal reduces across-the-board cuts already scheduled to take effect, restoring about $63 billion over two years. It includes a projected $85 billion in other savings. ""It's not the grand bargain that Obama and congressional Republicans once had wanted, but it ends the cycle of fiscal brinkmanship for now, by preventing another government shutdown for nearly two years. ""The bill signing marks one of Obama's last official acts in a year beset by the partial government shutdown, a near-default by the Treasury, a calamitous health care rollout and near-perpetual congressional gridlock.""

Reuters says the president also authorized ""appropriations for Department of Defense programs and related spending at other agencies. The act sets out a Pentagon base budget of $526.8 billion in the 2014 fiscal year.""

But, as NPR's Ari Shapiro reports, the defense authorization does not go as far as the president wants in closing Guantanamo Bay.

As he has in past years, Obama attached a signing statement complaining of ""unwarranted and burdensome restrictions"" on transferring detainees out of the prison.

Although the law eases those restrictions a bit, making it easier to transfer detainees to foreign countries, Congress still won't let the White House move detainees to U.S. soil, making it nearly impossible to close the prison, Shapiro reports.

Obama says the restrictions ""unwise"" and insists that ""the executive branch must have the authority to determine when and where to prosecute Guantanamo detainees.""",www.npr.org,center,kr46fVqzDF989dzq

The attack occurred during a site visit to the university by coalition members.

Ministry spokesman Gen. Mohammad Zahir Azimi said a ""terrorist in an army uniform"" opened fire on both local and international troops.

The Qargha shooting comes as so-called ""insider attacks"" -- incidents in which Afghan security turn on their NATO partners -- largely dropped last year. In 2013, there were 16 deaths in 10 separate attacks. In 2012, such attacks killed 53 coalition troops in 38 separate attacks.

Germany's military said 15 NATO soldiers were wounded in an assault launched ""probably by internal attackers."" The wounded included a German brigadier general, who the German military said was receiving medical treatment and was ""not in a life-threatening condition.""

NATO said it was investigating the attack, which Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned as ""cowardly.""

It is ""an act by the enemies who don't want to see Afghanistan have strong institutions,"" Karzai said in a statement.

Officials with the Taliban could not be immediately reached for comment.

Qargha is known as ""Sandhurst in the sand""-- referring to the famed British military academy -- as British forces oversaw building the officer school and its training program. In a statement, the British Defense Ministry said it was investigating the incident and that ""it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.""

Soldiers were tense in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. One soldier in a NATO convoy leaving Camp Qargha fired a pistol in an apparent warning shot in the vicinity of Associated Press journalists who were in a car, as well as pedestrians standing nearby. AP photographer Massoud Hossaini said he and an AP colleague were about 15 feet from the soldier at the time.

""The vehicle before the last one, someone shouted at me,"" Hossaini said. ""The last one, the soldier opened fire.""

No one was wounded.

Such ""insider attacks"" are sometimes claimed by the Taliban insurgency as proof of their infiltration. Others are attributed to personal disputes or resentment by Afghans who have soured on the continued international presence in their country more than a dozen years after the fall of the Taliban's ultra-conservative Islamic regime.

Foreign aid workers, contractors, journalists and other civilians in Afghanistan are increasingly becoming targets of violence as the U.S.-led military coalition continues a withdrawal to be complete by the end of the year.

At an Oct. 26 speech at her alma mater , the University of Denver , on the same day that Fox News reported that the rescue team at the CIA annex had been denied help , Broadwell was asked about Petraeus ’ handling of the Benghazi situation .
Her response was reported originally by Israel ’ s Arutz Sheva and Foreign Policy ’ s Blake Hounshell .
Broadwell quoted the Fox News report when she said : “ The facts that came out today were that the ground forces there at the CIA annex , which is different from the consulate , were requesting reinforcements . ''
Broadwell went on to explain more sensitive details from the Benghazi attacks , particularly concerning what the real cause might have been .
“ Now , I do n't know if a lot of you heard this , but the CIA annex had actually , um , had taken a couple of Libyan militia members prisoner and they think that the attack on the consulate was an effort to try to get these prisoners back . So that 's still being vetted . ”
In the original Oct. 26 Fox News report , sources at the annex said that the CIA ’ s Global Response Staff had handed over three Libyan militia members to the Libyan authorities who came to rescue the 30 Americans in the early hours of Sept. 12 .
A well-placed Washington source confirms to Fox News that there were Libyan militiamen being held at the CIA annex in Benghazi and that their presence was being looked at as a possible motive for the staged attack on the consulate and annex that night .
According to multiple intelligence sources who have served in Benghazi , there were more than just Libyan militia members who were held and interrogated by CIA contractors at the CIA annex in the days prior to the attack . Other prisoners from additional countries in Africa and the Middle East were brought to this location .
The Libya annex was the largest CIA station in North Africa , and two weeks prior to the attack , the CIA was preparing to shut it down . Most prisoners , according to British and American intelligence sources , had been moved two weeks earlier .
The CIA , though , categorically denied these allegations , saying : “ The CIA has not had detention authority since January 2009 , when Executive Order 13491 was issued . Any suggestion that the agency is still in the detention business is uninformed and baseless . ”
Broadwell ’ s affair with Petraeus was likely known to Holly Petraeus , according to family friends . The FBI reportedly knew about it months beforehand and White House Counterterrorism adviser John Brennan reportedly was aware that there was a relationship as early as the summer of 2011 .
The White House strongly denied that Brennan was aware so early .
“ It is irresponsible and flat out wrong for Fox News to run an anonymous , unsubstantiated , and blatantly false accusation , as Mr. Brennan was first made aware of the issue last Wednesday , '' spokesman Tommy Vietor said .
Broadwell , whose affair with Petraeus reportedly ended earlier this year , continued to serve as an informal spokesman for the CIA director . She suggests in her Denver speech that Petraeus knew almost immediately that the attack was a terror attack -- possibly to free militia members .
A few days later , Petraeus testified in a closed session to Congress that the attack was due in large part to an anti-Islam video and a spontaneous uprising , according to reports from the hearing .
Congressional leaders say privately they believe they were lied to by Petraeus when he testified shortly after the attack . Some of these members already considered charging Petraeus with perjury , but said they planned to withhold judgment until he testified this week . After resigning as CIA director , the CIA said Acting Director Mike Morrell would testify in his place .
All of this raises the question : What was the CIA really doing in Benghazi in addition to searching for Qaddafi ’ s stash of more than 22,000 shoulder-held missiles that could bring down commercial airplanes , and who in the White House knew exactly what the CIA was up to ?","Biographer Paula Broadwell could be facing questions about whether she revealed classified information about the Libya attack that she was privy to due to her relationship with then-CIA Director David Petraeus.

A well-placed Washington source confirms to Fox News that there were Libyan militiamen being held at the CIA annex in Benghazi and that their presence was being looked at as a possible motive for the staged attack on the consulate and annex that night.

According to multiple intelligence sources who have served in Benghazi, there were more than just Libyan militia members who were held and interrogated by CIA contractors at the CIA annex in the days prior to the attack. Other prisoners from additional countries in Africa and the Middle East were brought to this location.

The Libya annex was the largest CIA station in North Africa, and two weeks prior to the attack, the CIA was preparing to shut it down. Most prisoners, according to British and American intelligence sources, had been moved two weeks earlier.

The CIA, though, categorically denied these allegations, saying: “The CIA has not had detention authority since January 2009, when Executive Order 13491 was issued. Any suggestion that the agency is still in the detention business is uninformed and baseless.”

Broadwell’s affair with Petraeus was likely known to Holly Petraeus, according to family friends. The FBI reportedly knew about it months beforehand and White House Counterterrorism adviser John Brennan reportedly was aware that there was a relationship as early as the summer of 2011.

The White House strongly denied that Brennan was aware so early.

“It is irresponsible and flat out wrong for Fox News to run an anonymous, unsubstantiated, and blatantly false accusation, as Mr. Brennan was first made aware of the issue last Wednesday,"" spokesman Tommy Vietor said.

Broadwell, whose affair with Petraeus reportedly ended earlier this year, continued to serve as an informal spokesman for the CIA director. She suggests in her Denver speech that Petraeus knew almost immediately that the attack was a terror attack -- possibly to free militia members.

A few days later, Petraeus testified in a closed session to Congress that the attack was due in large part to an anti-Islam video and a spontaneous uprising, according to reports from the hearing.

Congressional leaders say privately they believe they were lied to by Petraeus when he testified shortly after the attack. Some of these members already considered charging Petraeus with perjury, but said they planned to withhold judgment until he testified this week. After resigning as CIA director, the CIA said Acting Director Mike Morrell would testify in his place.

All of this raises the question: What was the CIA really doing in Benghazi in addition to searching for Qaddafi’s stash of more than 22,000 shoulder-held missiles that could bring down commercial airplanes, and who in the White House knew exactly what the CIA was up to?",www.foxnews.com,right,x5uyQAke4YZfODpd

The difference is that the objective of the new site will be to train and arm Sunnis who have largely been excluded from other efforts at building up Iraq ’ s security forces .

It is a very tall order – and one that stands virtually no chance of succeeding in the absence of broad political reforms by the Shiite-led government in Baghdad that address the deep marginalization and political exclusion of Iraq ’ s Sunnis . That alienation has left many Sunnis either indifferent to Islamic State gains or in some cases even sympathetic to them .
Mr. Obama ’ s order reflects a request from Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi for more help for the fight to retake lost territory from the Islamic State .

It 's an eventuality and the first government that levels with its people about what it 's actually up to will be far stronger and resilient than one that is constantly hiding its activities . We 're grownups , for Christ 's sake , and if some sort of restriction on our freedoms or oversight on our activities is actually defensible and necessary for a legitimate security purpose , we 'll respond in a responsible way .
Every bullshit , after-the-fact rationalization drives a deeper wedge between citizens and government . White House press releases like the one issued on July 23 do n't help . `` In light of the recent unauthorized disclosures , '' it read , `` the President has said that he welcomes a debate about how best to simultaneously safeguard both our national security and the privacy of our citizens . '' In such moments , Barack Obama moves beyond cynicism into the realm of pure insult .
Whether we 're discussing the use of drones , metadata dragnets , or anything else that seems creepy at first mention , the real anxiety stems from a lack of a clearly articulated and defensible legal framework . As disconcerting as it was to learn of a secret presidential kill list , it was far worse to realize that there was essentially no controlling legal authority which bound Barack Obama 's decisionmaking process . Similarly , recognizing that the NSA is not simply unwilling to follow the law but incapable of even understanding it is unacceptable .
No government—or branch of government—wants to have its decisions vetted by any sort of watchdog , but that 's the only way to minimize errors and build confidence that national security operations are not ultimately creating a government within a government . We have reached the point where the courts originally set up by 1978 's FISA ( itself a product of an earlier era of massive violations of civil liberties ) , need a complete overhaul . If even sitting senators have trouble getting information about how and why the government is collecting information on citizens , something is wrong beyond repair .
The same is true for the foundational document in the War on Terror , which was passed by Congress on September 14 , 2001 and grants vague and sweeping powers to the president of the United States . It reads , `` The president is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations , organizations , or persons he determines planned , authorized , committed , or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11 , 2001 , or harbored such organizations or persons , in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations , organizations or persons . '' A dozen years after the 9/11 attacks , any such declaration needs to be scrapped , rewritten , and voted on—in the cold light of day , not a hot flash of panic .
Supporters of a massive , effectively unregulated surveillance state are constantly touting the benefits of dragnet-style reporting requirements and snooping . For instance , Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D-Calif. ) and Rep. Mike Rogers ( R-Mich. ) have said repeatedly that NSA logging of phone call metadata and internet traffic were instrumental in the 2009 arrests of Najibullah Zazi , who plotted to blow up New York 's subway system , and David Headley , who traveled to Mumbai to scope the Taj Mahal hotel for an attack . Yet it turns out that neither case provides any evidence for the efficacy of widespread surveillance programs .
Indeed , they point to the effectiveness of old-fashioned intelligence and police work , where authorities keep tabs on people and groups with well-known reputations for violence and terrorism ( Zazi was picked up based on tips from British agents ; as a former Drug Enforcment Adminstration informant ( ! ) , Headley was well-known to investigators ) .
Surveillance-state supporters are constantly invoking the `` needle-in-the-haystack '' metaphor , the idea being that finding terrorists requires patient sifting through huge mounds of extraneous material . It 's odd then , is n't it , that the basic urge is always to increase the size of the haystack rather than decrease it . Consider how The PATRIOT Act vastly increased the number of `` currency transaction reports '' ( CTRs ) that banks needed to file with the federal government in the name of outing terrorist money flows . Originally created to help snag drug kingpins , some 12 million CTRs were being filed annually before 9/11—a number that was already overwhelming any ability to use the information effectively . Creating a bigger haystack is n't a smart way to find bad guys hidden within .
The same dynamic is at work in arguably the most-visible and least-popular excresence of the war on terror : the creation of the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) and the imposition of invasive and time-consuming procedures at the nation 's airports . The threat of hijacked planes being used as missiles was effectively ended on the morning of 9/11 itself , when passengers charged hijackers on United Flt 93 and drove the plane into a Pennsylvania field . The barricading of cockpit doors shortly after 9/11 ended the possibility of a repeat of 9/11 . Yet we continue to fund a massively expensive system to search all people boarding airplanes in a long-running exercise in `` security theater '' that accomplishes nothing .
Speaking of the TSA leads directly into a final way of minimizing the excesses and wastefulness of a national surveillance state . Every policy and every agency needs to be reviewed for effectiveness over time . On its 10-year anniversary , the TSA was the subject of a withering report by Reps. John Mica ( R-Fla. ) and Paul Broun ( R-Ga. ) , who noted that $ 56 billion invested in making flying safer after 9/11 had not increased safety by any appreciable measure .
At the same , TSA personnel increased by 400 percent while passenger volume had increased by less than 12 percent . More recently , in July , the GAO released a report documenting a 27 percent increase in TSA-employee misconduct between 2010 and 2012 .
A variety of books over the past few years—including Moises Naim 's new The End of Power and Matt Welch 's and my The Declaration of Independents ( 2011 ) —document the way in which power and authority is leaching out of traditional centralized authorities such as governments , corporations , and churches . This result is a change in the relationship between state and citizen , producer and consumer , priest and congregant . What was once a far more hierarchical , top-down , and force-fed relationship is much flatter and more voluntary . Companies must do more than ever to placate their workers and customers , and even the Catholic Church can no longer issue doctrine without regard for the reaction of believers .
Governments , of course , maintain more power but even they rest ultimately upon the consent of the governed . At least since the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , our own government has used real and imaginary threats to engage in behavior that is not just increasingly being revealed to the public ( thank you , Edward Snowden and other whistleblowers ) but being reviled as noxious , misguided , and offensive to basic civil liberties and freedom . It 's little wonder then , that the president 's and Congress ' approval ratings are so low . Would that they would recognize us as partners in the war on terror rather than as potential combatants . They might just make our world a bit safer and be able to get on with their jobs of actually governing .

Like hits for Katy Perry, the scandals for the National Security Agency just keep coming. In the wake of revelations that the NSA has been tracking virtually every phone call ever made and sifting through Internet data like a crazed prospector panning for gold at Sutter's Mill, there's yet more disturbing news with every passing day.

The latest is that between 2006 and 2009, Politico reports, the NSA lied about its activities to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court charged with authorizing its snooping. Worse still, this outcome is a toxic mix of spy-agency overreach and bureaucratic incompetence. ""An internal inquiry into the misstatements also found that no one at the NSA understood how the entire call-tracking program worked,"" says Politico, which quotes an unnamed source who explains, ""There was nobody at NSA who really had a full idea of how the program was operating at the time.""

This is as outrageous as it is dispiriting (and predictable). But a dozen years after the 9/11 attacks ushered in the global war on terror, there's no reason that we should have to live in fear of our government's efforts to keep us safe and warm. Here are four basic principles that should inform what might be called a libertarian national security state. That is, one that helps to protects us without routinely transgressing constitutional guarantees to privacy, due process, freedom from illegal searches, and the right to be left alone.

1. Transparency uber alles.

One of the main reasons that Barack Obama's approval ratings are in the crapper is because of his epic failure to live up to his promise to run what he guaranteed would be the most transparent administration EVAH. That's especially true when it comes to national security issues. Even the most hardened anti-terror hawks have been shocked by revelations of widespread secret drone strikes, extra-judicial kill lists, a war on leakers and journalists, and ubiquitous snooping on Americans.

However disturbing it was to learn of massive surveillance of law-abiding citizens in violation of restrictions on the NSA, it was made even worse by blatant lies to the American public. When Director of National Intelligence James Clapper flat-out lied under oath to Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), there should have been immediate and visible consequences, both in terms of personnel and policy.

In an age of Wikileaks, Anonymous, Edward Snowden, and other ultimately unstoppable forces, transparency isn't just a buzzword, like green energy orfarm-fresh. It's an eventuality and the first government that levels with its people about what it's actually up to will be far stronger and resilient than one that is constantly hiding its activities. We're grownups, for Christ's sake, and if some sort of restriction on our freedoms or oversight on our activities is actually defensible and necessary for a legitimate security purpose, we'll respond in a responsible way.

Every bullshit, after-the-fact rationalization drives a deeper wedge between citizens and government. White House press releases like the one issued on July 23 don't help. ""In light of the recent unauthorized disclosures,"" it read, ""the President has said that he welcomes a debate about how best to simultaneously safeguard both our national security and the privacy of our citizens."" In such moments, Barack Obama moves beyond cynicism into the realm of pure insult.

2. Legal authority is not optional.

Whether we're discussing the use of drones, metadata dragnets, or anything else that seems creepy at first mention, the real anxiety stems from a lack of a clearly articulated and defensible legal framework. As disconcerting as it was to learn of a secret presidential kill list, it was far worse to realize that there was essentially no controlling legal authority which bound Barack Obama's decisionmaking process. Similarly, recognizing that the NSA is not simply unwilling to follow the law but incapable of even understanding it is unacceptable.

No government—or branch of government—wants to have its decisions vetted by any sort of watchdog, but that's the only way to minimize errors and build confidence that national security operations are not ultimately creating a government within a government. We have reached the point where the courts originally set up by 1978's FISA (itself a product of an earlier era of massive violations of civil liberties), need a complete overhaul. If even sitting senators have trouble getting information about how and why the government is collecting information on citizens, something is wrong beyond repair.

The same is true for the foundational document in the War on Terror, which was passed by Congress on September 14, 2001 and grants vague and sweeping powers to the president of the United States. It reads, ""The president is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons."" A dozen years after the 9/11 attacks, any such declaration needs to be scrapped, rewritten, and voted on—in the cold light of day, not a hot flash of panic.

3. Target the bad guys.

Supporters of a massive, effectively unregulated surveillance state are constantly touting the benefits of dragnet-style reporting requirements and snooping. For instance, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) have said repeatedly that NSA logging of phone call metadata and internet traffic were instrumental in the 2009 arrests of Najibullah Zazi, who plotted to blow up New York's subway system, and David Headley, who traveled to Mumbai to scope the Taj Mahal hotel for an attack. Yet it turns out that neither case provides any evidence for the efficacy of widespread surveillance programs.

Indeed, they point to the effectiveness of old-fashioned intelligence and police work, where authorities keep tabs on people and groups with well-known reputations for violence and terrorism (Zazi was picked up based on tips from British agents; as a former Drug Enforcment Adminstration informant (!), Headley was well-known to investigators).

Surveillance-state supporters are constantly invoking the ""needle-in-the-haystack"" metaphor, the idea being that finding terrorists requires patient sifting through huge mounds of extraneous material. It's odd then, isn't it, that the basic urge is always to increase the size of the haystack rather than decrease it. Consider how The PATRIOT Act vastly increased the number of ""currency transaction reports"" (CTRs) that banks needed to file with the federal government in the name of outing terrorist money flows. Originally created to help snag drug kingpins, some 12 million CTRs were being filed annually before 9/11—a number that was already overwhelming any ability to use the information effectively. Creating a bigger haystack isn't a smart way to find bad guys hidden within.

The same dynamic is at work in arguably the most-visible and least-popular excresence of the war on terror: the creation of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the imposition of invasive and time-consuming procedures at the nation's airports. The threat of hijacked planes being used as missiles was effectively ended on the morning of 9/11 itself, when passengers charged hijackers on United Flt 93 and drove the plane into a Pennsylvania field. The barricading of cockpit doors shortly after 9/11 ended the possibility of a repeat of 9/11. Yet we continue to fund a massively expensive system to search all people boarding airplanes in a long-running exercise in ""security theater"" that accomplishes nothing.

4. Track the effectiveness.

Speaking of the TSA leads directly into a final way of minimizing the excesses and wastefulness of a national surveillance state. Every policy and every agency needs to be reviewed for effectiveness over time. On its 10-year anniversary, the TSA was the subject of a withering report by Reps. John Mica (R-Fla.) and Paul Broun (R-Ga.), who noted that $56 billion invested in making flying safer after 9/11 had not increased safety by any appreciable measure.

At the same, TSA personnel increased by 400 percent while passenger volume had increased by less than 12 percent. More recently, in July, the GAO released a report documenting a 27 percent increase in TSA-employee misconduct between 2010 and 2012.

A variety of books over the past few years—including Moises Naim's new The End of Power and Matt Welch's and my The Declaration of Independents(2011)—document the way in which power and authority is leaching out of traditional centralized authorities such as governments, corporations, and churches. This result is a change in the relationship between state and citizen, producer and consumer, priest and congregant. What was once a far more hierarchical, top-down, and force-fed relationship is much flatter and more voluntary. Companies must do more than ever to placate their workers and customers, and even the Catholic Church can no longer issue doctrine without regard for the reaction of believers.

Governments, of course, maintain more power but even they rest ultimately upon the consent of the governed. At least since the attacks of September 11, 2001, our own government has used real and imaginary threats to engage in behavior that is not just increasingly being revealed to the public (thank you, Edward Snowden and other whistleblowers) but being reviled as noxious, misguided, and offensive to basic civil liberties and freedom. It's little wonder then, that the president's and Congress' approval ratings are so low. Would that they would recognize us as partners in the war on terror rather than as potential combatants. They might just make our world a bit safer and be able to get on with their jobs of actually governing.

The former Nebraska Republican senator was compelled under questioning to walk back a series of past statements , including one in which he complained about the `` Jewish lobby . '' He had several sparring partners throughout the day , but was questioned perhaps most aggressively by fellow Vietnam War veteran Sen. John McCain and freshman Texas Sen. Ted Cruz , both Republicans .
Hagel was caught by surprise when Cruz played two tapes from appearances on Al Jazeera -- one of which showed him not challenging a caller who accused Israel of war crimes , another in which he appeared to agree with the assertion that America is `` the world 's bully . ''
Of the Israel interview , Cruz said : `` The caller suggests that the nation of Israel has committed war crimes , and your response to that was not to dispute that characterization . '' He then asked Hagel directly whether he thinks Israel has committed war crimes .
`` No , I do not , '' Hagel said , while saying he wanted to see the `` full context '' of the interview .
Cruz called the war-crimes suggestion `` particularly offensive given that the Jewish people suffered under the most horrific war crimes in the Holocaust . ''
`` I would also suggest , '' he continued , `` that for ... a prospective secretary of Defense not to take issue with that claim is highly troubling . ''
Cruz then played the tape of Hagel being asked about the perception and `` reality '' that America is the world 's bully . Hagel could be heard calling the point a `` good one . ''
Cruz said the answer is `` not the conduct one would expect of a secretary of Defense . ''
Hagel disagreed with Cruz ' characterization of his answers . Further , Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin said he had told Cruz he would have preferred he use a transcript and not air that interview . Levin , a Democrat , later said he thought Hagel `` really advanced his own cause '' at the hearing .
The incident , though , was one of several confrontations Thursday as the committee considered Hagel 's nomination to succeed Leon Panetta at the Pentagon . Hagel is among the most controversial of President Obama 's second-term Cabinet nominees . The committee adjourned late Thursday afternoon without voting on the nomination .
Just days earlier , Sen. John Kerry easily won confirmation to be secretary of State .
It was the troop surge in Iraq that became a flashpoint between McCain and Hagel during Thursday 's hearing . McCain repeatedly tried to get Hagel to answer whether he was `` right or wrong '' when he once called the troop surge a `` dangerous foreign policy blunder . ''
`` I 'm not going to give you a yes or no -- I think it 's far more complicated than that . ... I 'll defer that judgment to history , '' Hagel said , adding that he was referring to both the overall Iraq war , as well as the surge , in that comment
McCain fired back : `` I think history has already made a judgment about the surge , sir , and you 're on the wrong side of it . ''
The senator added that Hagel 's `` refusal '' to answer the question `` will have an impact '' on whether he votes for his nomination .
McCain 's position on Hagel could be a significant bellwether for his nomination . The two veterans once had a close relationship during their years in the Senate , but politics and Hagel 's opposition to increased troop numbers in Iraq divided the two men .
In order to have a lock on the nomination , Hagel would need the support of all Senate Democrats and at least five Republicans -- just in case Republicans call for a 60-vote threshold to proceed to the confirmation vote . It 's possible Hagel would not need that many , though .
Hagel , during the hearing , urged lawmakers not to write him off based on a string of controversial votes and quotes from his career in the Senate .
`` Like each of you , I have a record , '' Hagel said Thursday . `` A record that I 'm proud of . I 'm proud of my record not because of any accomplishments I may have achieved , or certainly because of an absence of mistakes , but rather because I 've tried to build that record based on living my life and fulfilling my responsibilities as honestly as I knew how and with hard work . ''
He continued : `` But no one individual vote , no one individual quote , no one individual statement defines me , my beliefs , or my record . My overall worldview has never changed : that America has and must maintain the strongest military in the world ; that we must lead in the international community to confront threats and challenges together ... that we must use all our tools of American power to protect our citizens and our interests . ''
He noted he 's cast `` over 3,000 votes '' during his time in the Senate and given `` hundreds of interviews and speeches . ''
But the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee , Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma , announced at the start of the hearing that he would be opposing Hagel .
`` On many of the security challenges facing U.S. interests around the world , Senator Hagel 's record is deeply troubling , and out of the mainstream . Too often it seems he 's willing to subscribe to a worldwide view that is predicated on appeasing our adversaries while shunning our friends , '' he said . Further , he accused Hagel of recent `` reversals '' in his opinions `` that seem based on political expediency rather than on core beliefs . ''
Levin , D-Mich. , also said Hagel 's positions -- including opposition to unilateral sanctions on Iran and criticism of efforts to isolate both Syria and Hamas -- must be `` explored at this hearing . ''
Still , he said Hagel -- as a veteran -- has `` critically important qualifications '' of understanding the consequences of using military force .
Hagel later defended his opposition to unilateral sanctions on Iran , saying he took that position a decade ago , which he described as a `` different time . '' He did at one point describe the Iran government as `` legitimate . ''
As for claims that he 's got a shaky position toward Israel , he said `` I 've never voted against Israel ever in the 12 years I was in the Senate . ''
Two former committee chairmen -- Democrat Sam Nunn and Republican John Warner -- introduced and endorsed the nominee at the top of the hearing .
If confirmed , Hagel , a decorated Vietnam combat veteran , would be the first enlisted man and first Vietnam veteran to serve as defense secretary .
Hagel has the announced backing of about a dozen Democrats and the tacit support of dozens more who are unlikely to embarrass the president by defeating his Cabinet pick . One Republican -- Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi -- has said he will vote for his former colleague .
Six Republicans , including four members of the Armed Services panel , have said they will oppose Hagel 's nomination .
A recent Fox News poll showed 34 percent of voters saying they would vote to confirm Hagel , while 25 percent would not . The rest had not heard of him .
Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , earlier this month described Obama 's selection as an `` in-your-face '' pick but was a bit less critical this week .
Hagel testified Thursday that he is committed to Obama 's national security agenda . Addressing concerns about his stance on Iran , he said `` all options must be on the table '' to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon .
He also said it 's important that the county `` not hesitate to use the full force '' of the military in defense of security , `` but we must also be smart , and more importantly wise , '' in how that power is employed .
The hearing was the first time Hagel publicly addressed the barrage of criticism that he is not sufficiently pro-Israel or tough enough on Iran . Hagel has also been criticized for his comments about the influence of a `` Jewish lobby '' and his view of gay rights . Hagel apologized for the `` Jewish lobby '' comment Thursday .
He addressed several of the issues in a 112-page questionnaire to the committee in which he said his wartime experience would shape his decisions about using military force .
In his responses , Hagel adopted a hard line on Iran and its possible pursuit of a nuclear weapon . He echoed Obama 's view that all options are feasible to stop Tehran , praised the rounds of penalties and warned of `` severe and growing consequences '' if Iran balks at international demands .","Defense secretary nominee Chuck Hagel endured a barrage of criticism Thursday during his all-day confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill, challenged repeatedly by Republican lawmakers about his past positions on Israel, Iran, Iraq and other issues he'd be sure to confront at the helm of the Pentagon.

James N. Mattis as defense secretary . But he told the crowd and the TV cameras not to let it out of the room .
“ We are going to appoint ‘ Mad Dog ’ Mattis as our secretary of defense , but we are not announcing it until Monday , so don ’ t tell anybody , ” Mr. Trump said , referring to the general by his nickname .

The emergence of Gen. Mattis could create a “ complex chemistry ” between the Pentagon and the White House , analysts already were saying upon the first media reports of the Mattis choice Thursday afternoon .
For the general to assume the post , he would need Congress to waive a federal law that bars anyone who has been on active duty in the last seven years from becoming defense secretary . Gen. Mattis , 66 , retired as commander of the U.S. Central Command in 2013 after a more than 40-year career in the Marine Corps .

defense,Fox Online News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/02/26/defense-department-launches-aggressive-cyberattacks-against-isis.html,Defense Department launches aggressive cyberattacks against ISIS,2016-02-26,,"The U.S. military has launched a newly aggressive campaign of cyberattacks against Islamic State militants , targeting the group 's abilities to use social media and the Internet to recruit fighters and inspire followers , U.S. officials told The Associated Press .
The surge of computer-based military operations by U.S. Cyber Command began shortly after Defense Secretary Ash Carter prodded commanders at Fort Meade , Maryland , last month to ramp up the fight against the Islamic State group on the cyber front .
U.S. officials confirmed that operations launched out of Fort Meade have focused on disrupting the group 's online activities . The officials said the effort is getting under way as operators try a range of attacks to see what works and what does n't . They declined to discuss details , other than to say that the attacks include efforts to prevent the group from distributing propaganda , videos , or other types of recruiting and messaging on social media sites such as Twitter , and across the Internet in general .
Other attacks could include attempts to stop insurgents from conducting financial or logistical transactions online .
Several U.S. officials spoke about the cyber campaign on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly . Much of the effort is classified .
Carter mentioned the operations briefly Thursday , telling a House Appropriations subcommittee only that Cyber Command is beginning to conduct operations against the Islamic State group . He declined to say more in a public setting .
The more aggressive attacks come after months of pressure from Carter , who has been frustrated with the belief that the Pentagon — and particularly Cyber Command — was losing the war in the cyber domain .
Late last year Carter met with commanders , telling them they had 30 days to bring him options for how the military could use its cyberwarfare capabilities against the group 's deadly insurgency across Iraq and Syria , and spreading to Libya and Afghanistan . Officials said he told commanders that beefing up cyberwarfare against Islamic State was a test for them , and that they should have both the capability and the will to wage the online war .
But the military cyber fight is limited by concerns within the intelligence agencies that blocking the group 's Internet access could hurt intelligence gathering .
Officials said Carter told commanders that he wanted creative options that would allow the U.S. to impact Islamic State without diminishing the indications or warnings intelligence officers can glean about what the group is doing .
On Jan. 27 , Carter and Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , went to Fort Meade for an update .
Officials familiar with Carter 's meetings said the secretary was frustrated that as Cyber Command has grown and developed over the past several years , it was still focused on the cyberthreats from nations , such as Iran , Russia and China , rather than building a force to block the communications and propaganda campaigns of Internet-savvy insurgents .
`` He was right to say they could be more forward leaning about what they could possibly do against ISIS , '' said James Lewis , a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies . `` You could disrupt their support networks , their business networks , their propaganda and recruitment networks . ''
However , Lewis added , the U.S. needs to be careful about disrupting the Internet to insure that attacks do n't also affect civilian networks or systems needed for critical infrastructure and other public necessities .
U.S. officials have long been stymied by militants ' ability to use the Internet as a vehicle for inspiring so-called lone wolf attackers in Western nations , radicalized after reading propaganda easily available online .
`` Why should they be able to communicate ? Why should they be using the Internet ? '' Carter said during testimony before the defense appropriations subcommittee . `` The Internet should n't be used for that purpose . ''
He added that the U.S. can conduct cyber operations under the legal authorities associated with the ongoing war against the Islamic State group .

The surge of computer-based military operations by U.S. Cyber Command began shortly after Defense Secretary Ash Carter prodded commanders at Fort Meade, Maryland, last month to ramp up the fight against the Islamic State group on the cyber front.

U.S. officials confirmed that operations launched out of Fort Meade have focused on disrupting the group's online activities. The officials said the effort is getting under way as operators try a range of attacks to see what works and what doesn't. They declined to discuss details, other than to say that the attacks include efforts to prevent the group from distributing propaganda, videos, or other types of recruiting and messaging on social media sites such as Twitter, and across the Internet in general.

Other attacks could include attempts to stop insurgents from conducting financial or logistical transactions online.

Several U.S. officials spoke about the cyber campaign on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly. Much of the effort is classified.

Carter mentioned the operations briefly Thursday, telling a House Appropriations subcommittee only that Cyber Command is beginning to conduct operations against the Islamic State group. He declined to say more in a public setting.

The more aggressive attacks come after months of pressure from Carter, who has been frustrated with the belief that the Pentagon — and particularly Cyber Command — was losing the war in the cyber domain.

Late last year Carter met with commanders, telling them they had 30 days to bring him options for how the military could use its cyberwarfare capabilities against the group's deadly insurgency across Iraq and Syria, and spreading to Libya and Afghanistan. Officials said he told commanders that beefing up cyberwarfare against Islamic State was a test for them, and that they should have both the capability and the will to wage the online war.

But the military cyber fight is limited by concerns within the intelligence agencies that blocking the group's Internet access could hurt intelligence gathering.

Officials said Carter told commanders that he wanted creative options that would allow the U.S. to impact Islamic State without diminishing the indications or warnings intelligence officers can glean about what the group is doing.

On Jan. 27, Carter and Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, went to Fort Meade for an update.

Officials familiar with Carter's meetings said the secretary was frustrated that as Cyber Command has grown and developed over the past several years, it was still focused on the cyberthreats from nations, such as Iran, Russia and China, rather than building a force to block the communications and propaganda campaigns of Internet-savvy insurgents.

""He was right to say they could be more forward leaning about what they could possibly do against ISIS,"" said James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""You could disrupt their support networks, their business networks, their propaganda and recruitment networks.""

However, Lewis added, the U.S. needs to be careful about disrupting the Internet to insure that attacks don't also affect civilian networks or systems needed for critical infrastructure and other public necessities.

U.S. officials have long been stymied by militants' ability to use the Internet as a vehicle for inspiring so-called lone wolf attackers in Western nations, radicalized after reading propaganda easily available online.

""Why should they be able to communicate? Why should they be using the Internet?"" Carter said during testimony before the defense appropriations subcommittee. ""The Internet shouldn't be used for that purpose.""

He added that the U.S. can conduct cyber operations under the legal authorities associated with the ongoing war against the Islamic State group.

The U.S. has also struggled to defeat high-tech encryption techniques used by Islamic State and other groups to communicate. Experts have been working to find ways to defeat those programs.

Cyber Command is relatively new. Created in 2009, it did not begin operating until October 2010.

Early on, its key focus was on defending military networks, which are probed and attacked millions of times a day. But defense leaders also argued at length over the emerging issues surrounding cyberwarfare and how it should be incorporated.

(CNN) - The Senate failed to garner enough votes Thursday to stop a filibuster against Defense Secretary nominee Chuck Hagel.

Democrats needed 60 votes to end a filibuster, but the move failed due to GOP opposition surrounding questions about Hagel's finances, as well as remaining tension between some Republican senators and the White House over the terror attack in Benghazi, Libya.

The chamber largely voted along party lines, with the exception of four Republicans who voted with Democrats.

Republicans, however, signaled they're willing to allow the nomination to proceed after recess, when only a simple majority of 51 votes are required to stop a filibuster. The Senate is not in session next week.

Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin's office announced the Senate will take up another vote to move forward on Hagel on Tuesday, February 26.

Filibusters of cabinet officials are extremely rare, largely because senators typically believe a president has a right to pick the leaders of his government.

""I regret that Republican senators, except the valiant four, chose to filibuster the nomination,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said on the Senate floor. ""Republicans have made an unfortunate choice to ratchet up the level of destruction here in Washington. Just when you thought things couldn't get worse, it gets worse.""

The White House sent a letter to Capitol Hill Thursday stating that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called Libyan President Mohammed Magariaf the same night as the attack. President Obama, according to the letter, did not speak to the Libyan president until the evening of the day following the violence.

Read the letter obtained from a Democratic official here.

Before committing to vote on Hagel's nomination, three GOP senators–Sens. Lindsey Graham, John McCain and Kelly Ayotte–had demanded answers about the attack in a letter Tuesday to the Obama administration. Graham publicly stated that he was specifically asking whether Obama called Libyan officials on the night of the attack against the consulate in Benghazi, which left four Americans dead.

The administration had been wary of responding-saying the GOP was simply moving goal posts-but the response was a sign they were losing patience and getting nervous about the Hagel nomination.

Showing further scramble on the part of the White House to keep Hagel afloat in the confirmation process, Vice President Joe Biden made calls Thursday to Republican senators about the nominee, according to a senior Democratic source.

Hagel has been battling his way through a rocky nomination process. Democrats were at one point confident they had the 60 votes, including five Republicans, needed to stop a GOP filibuster, but concerns suddenly escalated Wednesday when McCain said he was reconsidering his previous commitment to vote against a filibuster.

McCain, R-Arizona, said Thursday evening on Fox News that Republicans approach to the Hagel vote was colored by past experiences.

""To be honest with you ... it goes back to [that] there's a lot of ill will towards Senator Hagel because when he was a Republican, he attacked President Bush mercilessly and [said] he was the worst president since Herbert Hoover and said the surge was the worst blunder since the Vietnam War, which was nonsense,"" McCain said. ""He was anti-his own party and people. People don't forget that.""

McCain now says he's satisfied with the answers the White House provided to questions about Benghazi and that he is in negotiations to get answers about Hagel's finances. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and other GOP senators want to know the source of Hagel's income in the years after he left the Senate.

""I think it was an adequate response, yes,"" McCain said about the Benghazi matter. ""We are working on and having negotiations now trying to smooth this thing out and get it done.""

But he later said on the Senate floor that will vote ""no"" to ending the filibuster on Thursday. He will, however, vote ""yes"" after recess.

""That is sufficient time to get any additional questions answered and I will vote in favor of cloture on the day we get back and I believe that my colleagues, enough of my colleagues will do the same,"" he said. A cloture vote would allow the nomination to proceed.

Graham, R-South Carolina, agreed and also told reporters he would vote for cloture after recess unless some huge ""bombshell"" comes out over the next week. His comments signaled that the votes will be there for Hagel when the Senate resumes session the week after next.

Multiple Republican senators told CNN earlier Thursday that they also planned to vote against ending a filibuster, saying the vote is too rushed with outstanding questions. When they hold a filibuster vote after the chamber gets back from recess, then they will allow the nomination to go through and the Senate can hold an up-or-down vote on Hagel.

Democrats, on the other hand, see this as a time to make it seem like Republicans are opposing Hagel for political reasons and holding the filibuster vote Thursday, as opposed to after recess, would further illustrate that objective.

Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, one of the few lawmakers to go against her own party on the vote, said she voted for cloture because ""I said I was not going to support a filibuster, and I stuck by my word."" Murkowski was one of the senators who spoke with Biden on Thursday.

Susan Collins of Maine, another Republican senator who voted yes, said she thinks the president should be able to choose his own cabinet. But she plans to vote no on Hagel when it comes to an up-or-down vote.

Reid took to the Senate floor on Thursday morning, building pressure on Republicans to back off of their threats. He added that the letter sent from the White House answers ""all their questions.""

Outgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta says he will remain in his position until a defense nominee is ""sworn into office,"" a senior Pentagon official said Thursday.

Administration officials and Congressional Democrats said they were on the phone late into the night Wednesday discussing how to get Republican votes. The sources said the administration had been told they did not have enough GOP votes to gain the necessary 60 to stop a filibuster.

Meanwhile, some questioned whether Hagel would withdraw his nomination. But one senior administration official said that idea is ""insane.""

Referring to the GOP, the official said, ""No one knows what they really want. There is nothing real to be had.""

""They wanted testimony from (former Secretary of State) Hillary Rodham Clinton and Leon Panetta and they got it...there is nothing real to be had,"" the official continued.

Hagel's brother Tom, a law professor who's in constant contact with his brother, also said Hagel will not withdraw his name.

""Knowing him, not only will he not withdraw, but he will be motivated to fight harder,"" he said.

Asked Wednesday in a press conference whether the GOP was moving goal posts on the issue, Graham gave a firm ""no.""

""I'm gonna hit you, and keep hitting you,"" he vowed. ""Absolutely. You're not going to get away without answering the basic questions. Did you make a phone call on September 11th to any Libyan government official using the weight and the voice of the president of the United States to help these people in their time of great need.""

Speaking aboard Air Force One, however, White House Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest stressed earlier Thursday a sense of urgency in filling the new defense secretary position.

""It is difficult to explain to our allies why exactly that is happening. It also sends a signal to our men and women in uniform who are currently deployed around the world and who are currently serving in the frontlines of Afghanistan and are taking fire today,"" he told reporters. ""They need a new secretary of defense. So we urge Republicans in the Senate to drop their delay.""

The Associated Press reported Wednesday that the actions are being considered as part of the Obama administration 's response to a report that claimed the Chinese Army is behind a series of cyberattacks on U.S. companies .
Officials familiar with the administration 's plans spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the threatened action .
The Chinese government denies being involved in the cyberattacks cited in a cybersecurity firm 's analysis of breaches that compromised more than 140 companies . On Wednesday , China 's Defense Ministry called the report deeply flawed .
Mandiant , a Virginia-based cybersecurity firm , released a torrent of details Monday that tied a secret Chinese military unit in Shanghai to years of cyberattacks against U.S. companies . Mandiant concluded that the breaches can be linked to the People 's Liberation Army 's Unit 61398 .
Military experts believe the unit is part of the People 's Liberation Army 's cybercommand , which is under the direct authority of the General Staff Department , China 's version of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . As such , its activities would likely be authorized at the highest levels of China 's military .
U.S. officials would not comment directly on the report Monday . But they said the U.S. is bulking up its cyber-defenses while stressing a new -- albeit controversial -- White House executive order aimed at improving the nation 's ability to defend against cyberattacks .
State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland and White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said U.S. officials have started a dialogue with the `` highest levels '' of the Chinese government , including with `` officials in the military . ''
`` It is a major challenge for us in the national security arena , '' Carney said Monday , adding that it is known that foreign countries and companies `` swipe '' sensitive U.S. information .
The release of the Mandiant report , complete with details on three of the alleged hackers and photographs of one of the military unit 's buildings in Shanghai , makes public what U.S. authorities have said less publicly for years . But it also increases the pressure on the U.S. to take more forceful action against the Chinese for what experts say has been years of systematic espionage .
`` If the Chinese government flew planes into our airspace , our planes would escort them away . If it happened two , three or four times , the president would be on the phone and there would be threats of retaliation , '' said Shawn Henry , former FBI executive assistant director . `` This is happening thousands of times a day . There needs to be some definition of where the red line is and what the repercussions would be . ''
Henry , the president of the security firm CrowdStrike , said that rather than tell companies to increase their cybersecurity , the government needs to focus more on how to deter the hackers and the nations that are backing them .
James Lewis , a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , said that in the past year the White House has been taking a serious look at responding to China . `` This will be the year they will put more pressure on , even while realizing it will be hard for the Chinese to change . There 's not an on-off switch , '' Lewis said .
In denying involvement in the cyberattacks tracked by Mandiant , China 's Foreign Ministry said China , too , has been a victim of hacking , some of it traced to the United States . Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei cited a report by an agency under the Ministry of Information Technology and Industry that said in 2012 alone foreign hackers used viruses and other malicious software to seize control of 1,400 computers in China and 38,000 websites .
`` Among the above attacks , those from the U.S. numbered the most , '' Hong said at a daily media briefing , lodging the most specific allegations the Chinese government has made about foreign hacking .
Cybersecurity experts say U.S. authorities do not conduct similar attacks or steal data from Chinese companies , but acknowledge that intelligence agencies routinely spy on other countries .
China is clearly a target of interest , said Lewis , noting that the U.S. would be interested in Beijing 's military policies , such as any plans for action against Taiwan or Japan .
In its report , Mandiant said it traced the hacking back to a neighborhood in the outskirts of Shanghai that includes a white 12-story office building run by the army 's Unit 61398 .
Mandiant said there are only two viable conclusions about the involvement of the Chinese military in the cyberattacks : Either Unit 61398 is responsible for the persistent attacks , or they are being done by a secret organization of Chinese speakers , with direct access to the Shanghai telecommunications infrastructure , who are engaged in a multi-year espionage campaign being run right outside the military unit 's gates .
`` In a state that rigorously monitors Internet use , it is highly unlikely that the Chinese government is unaware of an attack group that operates from the Pudong New Area of Shanghai , '' the Mandiant report said , concluding that the only way the group could function is with the `` full knowledge and cooperation '' of the Beijing government .
The unit `` has systematically stolen hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organizations , '' Mandiant wrote . A terabyte is 1,000 gigabytes . The most popular version of the new iPhone 5 , for example , has 16 gigabytes of space , while the more expensive iPads have as much as 64 gigabytes of space . The U.S. Library of Congress ' 2006-10 Twitter archive of about 170 billion tweets totals 133.2 terabytes .","The White House is reportedly considering fines and other trade penalties against China or any other country guilty of cyberattacks amid evidence of an unrelenting cyber espionage campaign linked to the Chinese government.

""This will be the year they will put more pressure on, even while realizing it will be hard for the Chinese to change. There's not an on-off switch,"" Lewis said.

In denying involvement in the cyberattacks tracked by Mandiant, China's Foreign Ministry said China, too, has been a victim of hacking, some of it traced to the United States. Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei cited a report by an agency under the Ministry of Information Technology and Industry that said in 2012 alone foreign hackers used viruses and other malicious software to seize control of 1,400 computers in China and 38,000 websites.

""Among the above attacks, those from the U.S. numbered the most,"" Hong said at a daily media briefing, lodging the most specific allegations the Chinese government has made about foreign hacking.

Cybersecurity experts say U.S. authorities do not conduct similar attacks or steal data from Chinese companies, but acknowledge that intelligence agencies routinely spy on other countries.

China is clearly a target of interest, said Lewis, noting that the U.S. would be interested in Beijing's military policies, such as any plans for action against Taiwan or Japan.

In its report, Mandiant said it traced the hacking back to a neighborhood in the outskirts of Shanghai that includes a white 12-story office building run by the army's Unit 61398.

Mandiant said there are only two viable conclusions about the involvement of the Chinese military in the cyberattacks: Either Unit 61398 is responsible for the persistent attacks, or they are being done by a secret organization of Chinese speakers, with direct access to the Shanghai telecommunications infrastructure, who are engaged in a multi-year espionage campaign being run right outside the military unit's gates.

""In a state that rigorously monitors Internet use, it is highly unlikely that the Chinese government is unaware of an attack group that operates from the Pudong New Area of Shanghai,"" the Mandiant report said, concluding that the only way the group could function is with the ""full knowledge and cooperation"" of the Beijing government.

The unit ""has systematically stolen hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organizations,"" Mandiant wrote. A terabyte is 1,000 gigabytes. The most popular version of the new iPhone 5, for example, has 16 gigabytes of space, while the more expensive iPads have as much as 64 gigabytes of space. The U.S. Library of Congress' 2006-10 Twitter archive of about 170 billion tweets totals 133.2 terabytes.

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — President Donald Trump on Friday celebrated the launch of Space Force , the first new military service in more than 70 years .
In signing the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act that includes Space Force , Trump claimed a victory for one of his top national security priorities just two days after being impeached by the House .
It is part of a $ 1.4 trillion government spending package — including the Pentagon ’ s budget — that provides a steady stream of financing for Trump ’ s U.S.-Mexico border fence and reverses unpopular and unworkable automatic spending cuts to defense and domestic programs .
“ Space is the world ’ s new war-fighting domain , ” Trump said Friday during a signing ceremony at Joint Base Andrews just outside Washington . “ Among grave threats to our national security , American superiority in space is absolutely vital . And we ’ re leading , but we ’ re not leading by enough , and very shortly we ’ ll be leading by a lot . ”
Later Friday , as he flew to his Florida resort aboard Air Force One , Trump signed legislation that will keep the entire government funded through Sept. 30 .
Space Force has been a reliable applause line at Trump ’ s political rallies , but for the military it ’ s seen more soberly as an affirmation of the need to more effectively organize for the defense of U.S. interests in space — especially satellites used for navigation and communication . Space Force is not designed or intended to put combat troops in space .
Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters Friday , “ Our reliance on space-based capabilities has grown dramatically , and today outer space has evolved into a warfighting domain of its own. ” Maintaining dominance in space , he said , will now be Space Force ’ s mission .
Space has become increasingly important to the U.S. economy and to everyday life . The Global Positioning System , for example , provides navigation services to the military as well as civilians . Its constellation of about two dozen orbiting satellites is operated by the 50th Space Wing from an operations center at Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado .
In a report last February , the Pentagon asserted that China and Russia have embarked on major efforts to develop technologies that could allow them to disrupt or destroy American and allied satellites in a crisis or conflict .
“ The United States faces serious and growing challenges to its freedom to operate in space , ” the report said .
When he publicly directed the Pentagon in June 2018 to begin working toward a Space Force , Trump spoke of the military space mission as part of a broader vision of achieving American dominance in space .
Trump got his Space Force , which many Democrats opposed . But it is not in the “ separate but equal ” design he wanted .
Instead of being its own military department , like the Navy , Army and Air Force , the Space Force will be administered by the Secretary of the Air Force . The law requires that the four-star general who will lead Space Force , with the title of Chief of Space Operations , will be a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , but not in Space Force ’ s first year . Trump said its leader will be Air Force Gen. John W. Raymond , the commander of U.S. Space Command .
Space Force is the first new military service since the Air Force was spun off from the Army in 1947 . Space Force will be the provider of forces to U.S. Space Command , a separate organization established earlier this year as the overseer of the military ’ s space operations .
The division of responsibilities and assets between Space Force and Space Command has not been fully worked out .
Space Force will be tiny , compared to its sister services . It will initially have about 200 people and a first-year budget of $ 40 million . The military ’ s largest service , the Army , has about 480,000 active-duty soldiers and a budget of about $ 181 billion . The Pentagon spends about $ 14 billion a year on space operations , most of which is in the Air Force budget .
Kaitlyn Johnson , a space policy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , sees the creation of Space Force as an important move but doubts it will prove as momentous as Trump administration officials suggest . Vice President Mike Pence has touted Space Force as “ the next great chapter in the history of our armed forces. ” And Esper earlier this week called this an “ epic moment ” in recent American military history .
Johnson says Democrats ’ opposition to making Space Force a separate branch of the military means it could be curtailed or even dissolved if a Democrat wins the White House next November .
“ I think that ’ s a legitimate concern ” for Space Force advocates , she said . “ Just because it ’ s written into law doesn ’ t mean it can ’ t be unwritten , ” she said , adding , “ Because of the politics that have started to surround the Space Force , I worry that that could damage its impact before it even has time to sort itself out ” within the wider military bureaucracy .

The death of al-Awlaki , a native of New Mexico , was reported everywhere at the time , but the U.S. government did not confirm or deny that it had a role in the al Qaeda militant ’ s death until Wednesday . In a letter sent to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy , D-Vt. , and a number of other congressional leaders , Attorney General Eric Holder said al-Awlaki and three other American citizens were killed in drone strikes in Yemen and Pakistan , including al-Awlaki ’ s son . The letter , which can be viewed below , was originally obtained by The New York Times .
“ Since 2009 , the United States , in the conduct of U.S. counterterrorism operations against al-Qa ’ ida and its associated forces outside of areas of active hostilities , has specifically targeted and killed one U.S. citizen , Anwar al-Aulaqi , ” the attorney general wrote . “ The United States is further aware of three other U.S. citizens who have been killed in U.S. counterterrorism operations over that same time period : Samir Khan , ‘ Abd al-Rahman Anwar al-Aulaqi , ’ and Jude Kenan Mohammed . These individuals were not specifically targeted by the United States . ”
Holder said President Barack Obama “ directed me to disclose certain information that until now has been properly classified. ” The letter pre-empted the president 's planned speech on drones and al Qaeda for Thursday in Washington .
The drone strike that killed al-Awlaki was seen as controversial on both sides of the political spectrum , with Obama administration critics saying he was entitled to due process as an American citizen .

Rand Paul , R-Ky. , has been the most outspoken lawmaker on the drone issue , staging a daylong Senate filibuster to dramatize his concerns about the possibility of the government using drones to target American citizens on U.S. soil .
Holder ’ s letter did not address the circumstances of Mohammed or Khan ’ s death , but it did go into detail on why the administration approved a drone strike on Anwar al-Awlaki .
The attorney general said al-Awlaki , a major figure in al Qaeda ’ s operations in Yemen , plotted to kill Americans and inspired Muslims to commit terrorist acts . Holder added that al-Awlaki provided support to Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , the so-called “ underwear bomber ” who failed in his attempt to blow up a Detroit-bound airliner .
Al-Awlaki “ was not just a senior leader of [ Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ] – he was the group ’ s chief of external operations , intimately involved in detailed planning and putting in place plots against U.S. persons , ” Holder wrote . “ In this role , al-Aulaqi made clear his intent to attack U.S. persons and his hope that these attacks would take American lives . ”
“ [ I ] t was not just al-Aulaqi ’ s words [ emphasis original ] that led the United States to act against him . … Rather , it was al-Aulaqi ’ s actions [ emphasis original ] – and , in particular , his direct personal involvement in the continued planning and execution of terrorist attacks against the U.S. homeland – that made him a lawful target and led the United States to take action . ”","After nearly two years, the U.S. government has formally claimed responsibility and acknowledged Wednesday that it targeted and killed American citizen and al Qaeda figure Anwar al-Awlaki in a drone attack in Yemen in September 2011.

The death of al-Awlaki, a native of New Mexico, was reported everywhere at the time, but the U.S. government did not confirm or deny that it had a role in the al Qaeda militant’s death until Wednesday. In a letter sent to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and a number of other congressional leaders, Attorney General Eric Holder said al-Awlaki and three other American citizens were killed in drone strikes in Yemen and Pakistan, including al-Awlaki’s son. The letter, which can be viewed below, was originally obtained by The New York Times.

“Since 2009, the United States, in the conduct of U.S. counterterrorism operations against al-Qa’ida and its associated forces outside of areas of active hostilities, has specifically targeted and killed one U.S. citizen, Anwar al-Aulaqi,” the attorney general wrote. “The United States is further aware of three other U.S. citizens who have been killed in U.S. counterterrorism operations over that same time period: Samir Khan, ‘Abd al-Rahman Anwar al-Aulaqi,’ and Jude Kenan Mohammed. These individuals were not specifically targeted by the United States.”

Holder said President Barack Obama “directed me to disclose certain information that until now has been properly classified.” The letter pre-empted the president's planned speech on drones and al Qaeda for Thursday in Washington.

The drone strike that killed al-Awlaki was seen as controversial on both sides of the political spectrum, with Obama administration critics saying he was entitled to due process as an American citizen. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has been the most outspoken lawmaker on the drone issue, staging a daylong Senate filibuster to dramatize his concerns about the possibility of the government using drones to target American citizens on U.S. soil.

Holder’s letter did not address the circumstances of Mohammed or Khan’s death, but it did go into detail on why the administration approved a drone strike on Anwar al-Awlaki.

The attorney general said al-Awlaki, a major figure in al Qaeda’s operations in Yemen, plotted to kill Americans and inspired Muslims to commit terrorist acts. Holder added that al-Awlaki provided support to Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the so-called “underwear bomber” who failed in his attempt to blow up a Detroit-bound airliner.

Al-Awlaki “was not just a senior leader of [Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula] – he was the group’s chief of external operations, intimately involved in detailed planning and putting in place plots against U.S. persons,” Holder wrote. “In this role, al-Aulaqi made clear his intent to attack U.S. persons and his hope that these attacks would take American lives.”

“[I]t was not just al-Aulaqi’s words [emphasis original] that led the United States to act against him . … Rather, it was al-Aulaqi’s actions [emphasis original] – and, in particular, his direct personal involvement in the continued planning and execution of terrorist attacks against the U.S. homeland – that made him a lawful target and led the United States to take action.”

After Obama changes tack on Syria , what would the presidential candidates do ?
Barack Obama ’ s announcement on Friday that American special forces will take a more active role in the war in Syria is for many critics of his foreign policy a confirmation that the US has inched deeper into a chaotic conflict .
Obama orders US special forces to 'assist ' fight against Isis in Syria Read more
It ’ s also an opportunity for presidential candidates to both praise and denounce him . And most Republican and Democratic presidential candidates propose doing even more than the raids that Obama has authorized , which skeptics call “ mission creep ” . The war pits the Syrian president , Bashar al-Assad , against various rebels and the jihadi group Islamic State , and now involves the US , Russia , Iran , Gulf states , Turkey , the Kurds and Iraq . Here ’ s how foreign policy might look under the ideas of potential presidents .
Nearly all the candidates of both parties have called for a no-fly zone over Syria , arguing that denying Assad ’ s air force will better protect civilians and rebels from bombing runs .
“ A superpower can impose a no-fly zone if it decides it wants to , ” said Stephen Biddle , a professor of international affairs at George Washington University . “ But the problems are it ’ s very expensive , no one is willing to pay the price , and these days there are serious risks of escalation . ”
A no-fly zone would require far more airstrikes on airfields and anti-aircraft batteries , for instance , putting American pilots in danger against Syrian missiles and jets . Russia ’ s entry into the war further complicates the proposal , increasing the risk of shooting down Russian aircraft bombing rebels .
And while a future president could warn Vladimir Putin to fly strikes at his own peril , the US stands to lose more should Putin simply continue strikes . An American president ’ s choice would then be to stand down or risk a wider , far more dangerous war – and political disaster at home – by firing on Russian pilots .
Nor would a no-fly zone offer certain protection to civilians or rebels whom an American president finds acceptable . Most of the war ’ s dead – civilian or combatant – have not been killed from the air but on the ground , by bullets , mortars and artillery shells , according to the Violations Documentation Center .
The statistics suggest a no-fly zone would not do much to staunch the bleeding of civilians or any friendly rebels . In contrast , Russia ’ s strategy of indiscriminate bombing boosts Assad ’ s much more limited aims , which do not take civilian casualties into account .
Only Republican Rand Paul and Democrats Martin O ’ Malley and Bernie Sanders oppose a no-fly zone .
Billionaire Donald Trump has maintained that “ safe zones ” on the ground in Syria and Iraq would help end the war and solve the refugee crisis , and said that Turkey and the Gulf states of Saudi Arabia , the UAE and Qatar should lead the effort with US help .
But while a ground campaign could defend civilians from the deadliest threats , it would also entail all the dangers of mission creep and the painstaking logistics of a war effort . One American has already died in a raid on an Isis facility , and a Russian soldier died in Syria last week .
“ To keep it safe would require fighting , ” the defense secretary , Ash Carter , told Congress on Tuesday . “ You need to think in each case … who ’ s in , who is kept out and how the enforcement of it is done . ”
Any campaign would probably need snipers , radar and recon teams , artillery and special operations teams – if not full infantry battalions , Micah Zenko , a senior fellow at the Council of Foreign Relations , has noted in Foreign Policy .
“ The types of interventions that proponents have endorsed for Syria are often based on deep misunderstandings of how US force was used on behalf of humanitarian missions in the past , ” Zenko wrote . “ Proposals that consciously ignore or downplay the amount and type of force needed to protect civilians are just wishful thinking . ”
Biddle agreed , adding that another problem is that safe zones offer cover to both civilians and combatants .
“ Say you set up a safe zone along the Turkish-Syrian border , and lo and behold guerrillas start operating within it , and the government starts firing artillery into it . What do you do then ? Silence the artillery by expanding your perimeter ? Push the perimeter until it ’ s all of Syria ? ”
He also noted the problem of policing – for instance , the dilemma of a suspected rebel whose family vouches for the person ’ s innocence .
“ You don ’ t have to walk very far down the thought experiment to end up with all sorts of problems and ambiguities , ” Biddle said .
Senator Marco Rubio is the most vocal supporter of embedding special forces with rebel and Kurdish ground troops .
Most of the candidates support arms for rebels , though few have specified which groups they find acceptable and how they would vet them – the same problems that have slowed Pentagon efforts in the last two years .
More problematically , most of the Syrian rebels eager for weapons and aid are not interested in a concerted fight against Isis . “ While there are tens of thousands of rebels willing to receive training and equipment to go after the Assad regime , few are willing to fight the Islamic State , ” Zenko wrote earlier this year .
Arming anti-Assad rebels may suit US interests , but it would also pit the US against Russia and Iran in a proxy war . Even regional allies disagree with American priorities about Isis , Biddle noted , which is why Turkey continues to bomb Kurds and Saudi Arabia and the UAE arm groups around the region , most notably in Syria but also in the ruins of Yemen . These same conflicted interests make it unlikely that the nations would ever band together to form their own “ safe zone ” .
“ They all have bigger fish to fry , ” he said . “ We ’ re the biggest , but we ’ re the only one who thinks Isil is the threat to be resolved first . ”
Although Kurdish fighters have proven the most reliable allies for US ground offensives , Turkish warplanes have increased bombing sorties against Kurdish forces in Syria and Iraq , meaning increased arms for the Kurds could fuel a war between two American allies on yet another border .
Arming Kurdish fighters could also lead to the US supplying groups that it has named terrorists , if it hasn ’ t inadvertently done so already . In October Amnesty International accused the Kurdish group YPG of human rights violations .
Rubio , Jeb Bush and Lindsey Graham have spoken strongly in favor of arming Syrian rebel groups and Kurds , Ted Cruz has called for directly arming the Kurds , Hillary Clinton urged arms for rebels and Kurds while she was secretary of state , and even O ’ Malley has said the US should “ probably ” arm the fighters .
All candidates except Senator Rand Paul have said they support Obama ’ s decision to extend the US military presence in Afghanistan to 2017 , though a handful say they only do so out of deference to the generals ’ advice .
But the presence of 5,500 to 10,000 troops , as the president and candidates prescribe , would have little effect on the war against the Taliban , experts said . Most said a steady run of airstrikes had prevented the Taliban from massing , and that the end of “ combat operations ” – resulting in a lull in airstrikes – had given the militants opportunity to retake cities and regroup .
The spread of American troops at four airbases around Afghanistan and continued airstrikes – including one that bombed a hospital – suggests Obama plans to let generals use as much airpower as possible to support Afghan forces .

Arming rebels and Kurdish fighters

Most of the candidates support arms for rebels, though few have specified which groups they find acceptable and how they would vet them – the same problems that have slowed Pentagon efforts in the last two years.

Although Kurdish fighters have proven the most reliable allies for US ground offensives, Turkish warplanes have increased bombing sorties against Kurdish forces in Syria and Iraq, meaning increased arms for the Kurds could fuel a war between two American allies on yet another border.

Arming Kurdish fighters could also lead to the US supplying groups that it has named terrorists, if it hasn’t inadvertently done so already. In October Amnesty International accused the Kurdish group YPG of human rights violations.

The spread of American troops at four airbases around Afghanistan and continued airstrikes – including one that bombed a hospital – suggests Obama plans to let generals use as much airpower as possible to support Afghan forces. But neither he nor any candidate has shown any appetite for a major reinforcement.

Withdrawal

Barring dramatic changes to Barack Obama’s plans and the politics of the Middle East, 2017 will begin with 5,500 troops across Afghanistan and a number of special forces teams operating in Syria and Iraq.

Paul, Trump and Cruz have all offered variations on a plan that could see US forces withdraw from the region, ceding a lead military role to Russia and Iran but continuing airstrikes against Isis. But while staying out of foreign conflicts has appeal at home to Democrats and Republicans alike – and arguably supports US interests – “it still sacrifices interests that are real, even if they’re limited,” Biddle said.

Russian officials suspected that the interceptors were a counter to their missiles and had indicated that they would not consider further nuclear arms cuts unless their concerns were resolved .
Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the cancellation was part of an overall restructuring of missile defense plans aimed at stopping missiles from North Korea and Iran .

The issue is particularly sensitive because Obama was overheard whispering in an open microphone last year telling then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev at an international summit that he would have more flexibility on resolving their differences over the missile defense program after his re-election in November .

defense,USA TODAY,1,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/11/24/chuck-hagel-resignation/19477321/,"Defense Secretary Hagel will resign, sources say",2014-11-24,,"WASHINGTON — President Obama announced the resignation of Chuck Hagel Monday , commending the secretary of Defense for his `` steady hand '' through a period of transition for the United States ' military .
Obama suggested that it was Hagel 's decision to resign after less than two years in office , saying , `` If there 's one thing I know about Chuck , it 's that he does not make this or any other decision lightly . ''
Two Defense Department officials speaking on condition of anonymity said Hagel had been under pressure from the White House on a variety of fronts , and that tension caused several discussions that led to his resignation .
The 68-year-old Hagel said he will stay on the job `` every day , every moment '' until his successor is nominated and confirmed by the Senate . `` It 's been the greatest privilege of my life to lead , and most importantly , to serve , '' Hagel said in an announcement from the White House Monday morning .
Obama and Hagel made the announcement in the State Dining Room of the White House Monday morning , in front of about two dozen senior officials and Cabinet secretaries .
Afterward , Hagel hugged Obama and then turned toward the audience and bowed .
Hagel arrived at the Pentagon in February 2013 during a period of belt-tightening and disengagement for the military , but ended up leading the fight against new and different enemies — the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , and the Ebola outbreak in western Africa .
The announcement also comes shortly as Obama approves plans to give U.S. military commanders bigger roles alongside Afghanistan forces as they fight the Taliban following the end of the U.S. combat operation next month .
A White House official said Hagel began speaking with Obama about departing the administration beginning in October , noting that the midterm congressional elections provided a natural transition . Obama has also spoken to many top administration officials about whether they would stay on for the last two years of his presidency , the official said .
Administration officials said possibilities for Hagel 's job include Michèle Flournoy , a former undersecretary of Defense for policy who was runner-up for the slot when Obama tapped Hagel in early 2013 ; Sen. Jack Reed , D-R.I. , a defense specialist and a former officer with the Army 's 82nd Airborne ; and Ashton Carter , a former deputy secretary of Defense .
Reed disavowed any interest . `` Senator Reed loves his job and wants to continue serving the people of Rhode Island in the United States Senate , '' said press secretary Chip Unruh .
Discussions about Hagel began a few weeks ago but picked up momentum Friday , according to a senior Defense Department official who was not authorized to speak publicly . By the weekend , the decision had been made and there was concern that it would leak out .
Asked directly whether Hagel was forced out , White House press secretary Josh Earnest said `` the two of them arrived together '' at the decision . He noted that Hagel 's tenure is consistent with those of Obama 's two other Defense secretaries , Robert Gates and Leon Panetta .
A series of foreign policy crises , including the rise of the Islamic State and the slow response to the Ebola epidemic , contributed to the need to for a change in senior personnel , the official said .
Another senior Defense Department official said Hagel did not clash with the White House on policy , nor was he stepping down in protest .
TheNew York Times , citing anonymous sources , first reported the resignation Monday .
Obama nominated Hagel in January 2013 to succeed Panetta . As a former senator from Nebraska who had forged a friendship with Obama in the Senate , Hagel became the only Republican on Obama 's national security team .
`` We come from different parties , but in accepting this position , you sent a powerful message , especially to those in this city , that when it comes to our national security and our military families , our country always comes first , '' Obama said Monday .
Hagel got off to a rocky start even before he was sworn in . His confirmation hearings before the Senate were contentious — even with former colleagues from his own Republican Party . Although relations with Capitol Hill improved over the last two years , Hagel still struggled to articulate Pentagon policies in briefings and speeches .
`` Secretary Chuck Hagel and I have had our differences over many years , but I have always considered him a friend , a patriot , and a dedicated public servant who has always put our country first and the needs of our men and women in uniform above his own , '' Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz. , said in a statement .
He also said that Hagel was frustrated by the administration 's national security policy and decision-making process , and that Defense secretaries have been micro-managed by the Obama White House .
The Defense secretary had planned a trip to Asia , including a scheduled stop in Vietnam that had personal meaning for Hagel .

WASHINGTON — President Obama announced the resignation of Chuck Hagel Monday, commending the secretary of Defense for his ""steady hand"" through a period of transition for the United States' military.

Obama suggested that it was Hagel's decision to resign after less than two years in office, saying, ""If there's one thing I know about Chuck, it's that he does not make this or any other decision lightly.""

Two Defense Department officials speaking on condition of anonymity said Hagel had been under pressure from the White House on a variety of fronts, and that tension caused several discussions that led to his resignation.

The 68-year-old Hagel said he will stay on the job ""every day, every moment"" until his successor is nominated and confirmed by the Senate. ""It's been the greatest privilege of my life to lead, and most importantly, to serve,"" Hagel said in an announcement from the White House Monday morning.

Obama and Hagel made the announcement in the State Dining Room of the White House Monday morning, in front of about two dozen senior officials and Cabinet secretaries.





Afterward, Hagel hugged Obama and then turned toward the audience and bowed.

Hagel arrived at the Pentagon in February 2013 during a period of belt-tightening and disengagement for the military, but ended up leading the fight against new and different enemies — the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, and the Ebola outbreak in western Africa.

The announcement also comes shortly as Obama approves plans to give U.S. military commanders bigger roles alongside Afghanistan forces as they fight the Taliban following the end of the U.S. combat operation next month.

A White House official said Hagel began speaking with Obama about departing the administration beginning in October, noting that the midterm congressional elections provided a natural transition. Obama has also spoken to many top administration officials about whether they would stay on for the last two years of his presidency, the official said.

Administration officials said possibilities for Hagel's job include Michèle Flournoy, a former undersecretary of Defense for policy who was runner-up for the slot when Obama tapped Hagel in early 2013; Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., a defense specialist and a former officer with the Army's 82nd Airborne; and Ashton Carter, a former deputy secretary of Defense.

Reed disavowed any interest. ""Senator Reed loves his job and wants to continue serving the people of Rhode Island in the United States Senate,"" said press secretary Chip Unruh.

Discussions about Hagel began a few weeks ago but picked up momentum Friday, according to a senior Defense Department official who was not authorized to speak publicly. By the weekend, the decision had been made and there was concern that it would leak out.

Asked directly whether Hagel was forced out, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said ""the two of them arrived together"" at the decision. He noted that Hagel's tenure is consistent with those of Obama's two other Defense secretaries, Robert Gates and Leon Panetta.

A series of foreign policy crises, including the rise of the Islamic State and the slow response to the Ebola epidemic, contributed to the need to for a change in senior personnel, the official said.

Another senior Defense Department official said Hagel did not clash with the White House on policy, nor was he stepping down in protest.

TheNew York Times, citing anonymous sources,first reported the resignation Monday.

Obama nominated Hagel in January 2013 to succeed Panetta. As a former senator from Nebraska who had forged a friendship with Obama in the Senate, Hagel became the only Republican on Obama's national security team.

""We come from different parties, but in accepting this position, you sent a powerful message, especially to those in this city, that when it comes to our national security and our military families, our country always comes first,"" Obama said Monday.

Hagel got off to a rocky start even before he was sworn in. His confirmation hearings before the Senate were contentious — even with former colleagues from his own Republican Party. Although relations with Capitol Hill improved over the last two years, Hagel still struggled to articulate Pentagon policies in briefings and speeches.

""Secretary Chuck Hagel and I have had our differences over many years, but I have always considered him a friend, a patriot, and a dedicated public servant who has always put our country first and the needs of our men and women in uniform above his own,"" Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said in a statement.

He also said that Hagel was frustrated by the administration's national security policy and decision-making process, and that Defense secretaries have been micro-managed by the Obama White House.

The Defense secretary had planned a trip to Asia, including a scheduled stop in Vietnam that had personal meaning for Hagel. When it was canceled earlier this month, Pentagon sources said the change signaled trouble for Hagel's tenure — but officials from the White House and Pentagon immediately denied that Hagel was considering leaving or being pushed to step down.

Hagel was the first enlisted combat veteran to serve as secretary of Defense —- a quality that Obama said made him particularly attuned to the needs of servicemembers and their families.

""He's been in the dirt. He's been in the mud. And that has established a special bond. He sees himself in them. They see themselves in him."" Obama said. ""He volunteered for Vietnam and still has the scars and shrapnel from the battles he has fought.""

Obama will be the first president since Harry Truman to have four Defense secretaries during his time in office. The position was created during Truman's tenure in 1947.

Policy aside, Hagel’s bedeviled by his own abrasive personality. In a chamber known for back-patting and elbow-rubbing, the former Nebraska senator mostly rubbed people the wrong way. Now, on his path to the Pentagon, he has to hope that irritation doesn’t come back to bite him.

“He was respected as a colleague in the normal Senate tradition but was somewhat of a lone wolf and did not forge the deep personal relationships with his fellow Republicans that would translate into a ready reservoir of support for his nomination,” said John Ullyot, a former Marine intelligence officer who was the spokesman for the Senate Armed Services Committee under Chairman John Warner from 2003 to 2007. “On top of that, his outspokenness and blunt criticism of several Republican priorities at a critical time, including Iraq and Iran, while sincere and heartfelt, have left him without a natural platform of enthusiasm for his confirmation.”

Those hurdles “are not insurmountable,” Ullyot added. “But he starts the process with a long and uncharted road ahead.”

In the past, a former senator could count on getting a gentleman’s confirmation vote from his old club. But Hagel can’t even count on a fellow Republican Cornhusker to give him a hand.

One vote that will be tough for Hagel to win: that of fellow Nebraska Republican Deb Fischer. Hagel crossed party lines to back Fischer’s Democratic opponent, former Sen. Bob Kerrey, in 2012.

WASHINGTON — The Pentagon's plan to erase the ""stain"" of sexual assault in the ranks doesn't wash with some members of Congress who say it doesn't go far enough.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel ordered tighter control of recruiters and trainers, shored up protections for victims and improved tracking of complaints and cases involving sexual abuse.

Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., said Hagel's efforts are welcome but the Pentagon needs to do more.

""The truth is in terms of addressing the systemic problem, in terms of addressing the culture, most of these guidelines do very little,"" Speier, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, told USA TODAY in an interview. She is one of the more active members of Congress pushing for more changes in how the military deals with the issue.

Among Hagel's initiatives:

• Ensure the enforcement of policies prohibiting inappropriate relationships between recruiters, instructors and green troops. USA TODAY has reported that the Pentagon has disqualified 60 troops from roles as recruiters, instructors or counselors after it screened them for criminal backgrounds, including sexual assault.

• Establish a victim-advocacy program in each service to provide legal advice and representation for those bringing sexual assault complaints.

• Give commanders authority to transfer those accused of committing sexual assault to another unit. Currently, victims seek to serve in another unit, but the accused does not have to leave.

• Mandate that a military lawyer be the investigating officer for all Article 32 hearings — the civilian equivalent of a preliminary hearing — involving sexual assault. Currently, that investigating officer does not have to be a lawyer.

• Seek regular reports from the inspector general on investigations of sexual assault that have been closed to ensure they were properly handled.

""All of these measures will provide victims additional rights, protections and legal support, and help ensure that sexual assault-related investigations and judicial proceedings are conducted thoroughly and professionally,"" Hagel said in a statement.

The moves come as Congress contemplates an overhaul of the system the armed services have developed to combat sexual assault. The issue came to the fore — and has largely stayed there — in the spring when the Pentagon announced that it estimated 26,000 cases of sexual assault had occurred in 2012.

""Sexual assault is a stain on the honor of our men and women who honorably serve our country, as well as a threat to the discipline and the cohesion of our force,"" Hagel said. ""It must be stamped out.""

Lt. Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, director of the Joint Staff, called sexual assault in the military a ""serious and persistent problem"" that erodes trust.

Thursday's announcement was a first step, White House press secretary Jay Carney said in a statement. ""The initiatives announced today are substantial, but only a step along a path toward eliminating this crime from our military ranks,"" Carney said. ""The president expects this level of effort to be sustained not only in the coming weeks and months, but as far into the future as necessary.""

Is there nothing it can ’ t underplay ? Yesterday , more than two months after the terrorist attack on our consulate in Benghazi left four Americans dead and the American response a confused mess , the Pentagon finally got around to releasing its version of the timeline of military response to the crisis to the Associated Press — when most newspapers and broadcast networks had closed up shop for the day . Small wonder , too , because the timeline showed that it took 19 hours for military assistance to arrive ( via Twitchy ) :
New Pentagon details show that the first U.S. military unit arrived in Libya more than 15 hours after the attack on the consulate in Benghazi was over , and four Americans , including the ambassador , were dead . A Defense Department timeline obtained by The Associated Press underscores how far the military response lagged behind the Sept. 11 attack , due largely to the long distances the commando teams had to travel to get to Libya . Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and his top military adviser were notified of the attack about 50 minutes after it began and were about to head into a previously scheduled meeting with President Barack Obama . The meeting quickly turned into a discussion of potential responses to the unfolding situation in Benghazi , where militants had surrounded the consulate and set it on fire . The first wave of the attack at the consulate lasted less than two hours . … But there have been persistent questions about whether the Pentagon should have moved more rapidly to get troops into Libya or had units closer to the area as the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on America approached . In particular , there was at least a 19-hour gap between the time when Panetta first ordered military units to prepare to deploy – between midnight and 2 a.m. local time in Tripoli – and the time a Marine anti-terrorism team landed in Tripoli , which as just before 9 p.m .
Why so long ? The Pentagon claims that the situation was “ murky , ” that they didn ’ t understand whether a hostage situation might develop , and also claimed not to have been aware of any specific threats . That would be news to anyone following the Benghazi story in some depth . Ambassador Chris Stevens warned repeatedly of threats to the Benghazi mission for months , requesting more security . On the day of the attack , three hours before it began and roughly five hours before Stevens was killed , the Benghazi consulate alerted State that radical Islamist terrorists had begun “ gathering weapons and gathering steam , ” plus a note that their security team of Libyan militia had taken pictures inside the compound for no apparent reason earlier that day .
Put this in the context of the date and place . The attack took place on the anniversary of 9/11 , when we expect terrorist activity to take place in celebration of their biggest victory over the US .

The Benghazi mission was in the middle of a city that had no effective government control . And the reason that the Pentagon couldn ’ t anticipate the attack on Benghazi and have its assets positioned for immediate response , with all of the above intel , would be … ?
Panetta said that based on a continuous evaluation of threats , military forces were spread around Europe and the Middle East to deal with a variety of missions . In the months before the attack , he noted , “ several hundred reports were received indicating possible threats to U.S. facilities around the world ” and noted that there was no advance notice of imminent threats to U.S. personnel or facilities in Benghazi .
If that ’ s true , then what did the State Department and Hillary Clinton do with all of those warnings from Stevens about Benghazi , including the one from earlier that day ? Did Clinton and State never bother to inform Panetta ? That seems to be what the Pentagon timeline and the AP ’ s reporting suggests — that the first time that Panetta thought there was a credible threat against the Benghazi consulate was in the meeting with Obama 50 minutes after the attack started .
His explanation , however , did not satisfy McCain . In a statement Friday , McCain said Panetta ’ s letter , “ only confirms what we already knew – that there were no forces at a sufficient alert posture in Europe , Africa or the Middle East to provide timely assistance to our fellow citizens in need in Libya . The letter fails to address the most important question – why not ? ”
Why not , indeed ? Why did the US get caught with its pants down on the anniversary of 9/11 in what had widely been known as Terrorist Central , a situation directly caused by American and NATO intervention in Libya 17 months earlier ? State is pointing fingers at the CIA and Pentagon , intel is pointing theirs back to State , and now so is the Pentagon . But this all begins at the White House and an apparent lack of curiosity about the wide-open environment provided to terrorist groups by our decapitation of the Qaddafi regime and the security consequences for American interests .
All of the Friday night document dumps in the world won ’ t cover for that . And I can ’ t help but wonder who ’ s sex scandal will distract from the next Friday night document dump when it occurs .","Ah, the Friday night news dump, a tradition that transcends party in Washington DC. Is there nothing it can’t underplay? Yesterday, more than two months after the terrorist attack on our consulate in Benghazi left four Americans dead and the American response a confused mess, the Pentagon finally got around to releasing its version of the timeline of military response to the crisis to the Associated Press — when most newspapers and broadcast networks had closed up shop for the day. Small wonder, too, because the timeline showed that it took 19 hours for military assistance to arrive (via Twitchy):

New Pentagon details show that the first U.S. military unit arrived in Libya more than 15 hours after the attack on the consulate in Benghazi was over, and four Americans, including the ambassador, were dead. A Defense Department timeline obtained by The Associated Press underscores how far the military response lagged behind the Sept. 11 attack, due largely to the long distances the commando teams had to travel to get to Libya. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and his top military adviser were notified of the attack about 50 minutes after it began and were about to head into a previously scheduled meeting with President Barack Obama. The meeting quickly turned into a discussion of potential responses to the unfolding situation in Benghazi, where militants had surrounded the consulate and set it on fire. The first wave of the attack at the consulate lasted less than two hours. … But there have been persistent questions about whether the Pentagon should have moved more rapidly to get troops into Libya or had units closer to the area as the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on America approached. In particular, there was at least a 19-hour gap between the time when Panetta first ordered military units to prepare to deploy – between midnight and 2 a.m. local time in Tripoli – and the time a Marine anti-terrorism team landed in Tripoli, which as just before 9 p.m.

Why so long? The Pentagon claims that the situation was “murky,” that they didn’t understand whether a hostage situation might develop, and also claimed not to have been aware of any specific threats. That would be news to anyone following the Benghazi story in some depth. Ambassador Chris Stevens warned repeatedly of threats to the Benghazi mission for months, requesting more security. On the day of the attack, three hours before it began and roughly five hours before Stevens was killed, the Benghazi consulate alerted State that radical Islamist terrorists had begun “gathering weapons and gathering steam,” plus a note that their security team of Libyan militia had taken pictures inside the compound for no apparent reason earlier that day.

Put this in the context of the date and place. The attack took place on the anniversary of 9/11, when we expect terrorist activity to take place in celebration of their biggest victory over the US. It took place in Benghazi, where the US government and everyone else knew these terrorist groups acted openly, having been freed from the oppression of the Qaddafi regime by Barack Obama and NATO a year earlier. The Benghazi mission was in the middle of a city that had no effective government control. And the reason that the Pentagon couldn’t anticipate the attack on Benghazi and have its assets positioned for immediate response, with all of the above intel, would be … ?

Panetta said that based on a continuous evaluation of threats, military forces were spread around Europe and the Middle East to deal with a variety of missions. In the months before the attack, he noted, “several hundred reports were received indicating possible threats to U.S. facilities around the world” and noted that there was no advance notice of imminent threats to U.S. personnel or facilities in Benghazi.

If that’s true, then what did the State Department and Hillary Clinton do with all of those warnings from Stevens about Benghazi, including the one from earlier that day? Did Clinton and State never bother to inform Panetta? That seems to be what the Pentagon timeline and the AP’s reporting suggests — that the first time that Panetta thought there was a credible threat against the Benghazi consulate was in the meeting with Obama 50 minutes after the attack started.

John McCain, for one, isn’t buying that explanation:

The FBI notified the Defense Department on Sunday of “potentially inappropriate communications” between Allen and Kelley, and turned over to Pentagon lawyers 20,000 to 30,000 pages of emails exchanged by the two from 2010 to 2012.

The email web has now ensnared two of the biggest stars of the U.S. national-security establishment, and two of the commanders in America’s longest war. Allen succeeded Petraeus as commander in Afghanistan in July 2011. Before that, Allen had been based in Tampa as deputy commander of the U.S. Central Command.

From late 2008 until mid-2010, Allen was deputy commander at CENTCOM while Petraeus was commander.

Kelley, 37, who had complained of threatening emails from Petraeus biographer Paula Broadwell, has been described as a Tampa socialite and friend of Petraeus who was viewed by Broadwell as a potential romantic rival.

Kelley’s complaint to an FBI agent about the emails touched off the investigation that led to the resignation of Petraeus, 60, on Friday.

Allen holds one of the highest profile and most sensitive positions in the military, consulting with President Barack Obama, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Afghan President Hamid Karzai as the U.S. prepares to transition control of the country’s security to Afghans. The U.S. has about 68,000 troops in Afghanistan, and the total NATO force numbers about 100,000.

President Barack Obama called Wednesday for “ peace with justice ” as he proposed reducing U.S. nuclear arsenals by as much as one-third in a wide-ranging call for action delivered on the eastern side of Berlin ’ s Brandenburg Gate .
“ Our work is not yet done . For we are not only citizens of America or Germany , we are citizens of the world , ” Obama said , drawing on John F. Kennedy ’ s 1963 speech on the west side of the the city , in which he called on Berliners to look ahead to “ the day of peace with justice ” and to the rest of mankind . “ We may not live in fear of nuclear annihilation — but as long as nuclear weapons exist , we are not truly safe . ”
He said the United States is now looking to do more to reduce that threat . “ After a comprehensive review , I have determined that we can ensure the security of America and our allies and maintain a strong and credibility strategic deterrent while reducing our deployed strategic nuclear weapons by up to one-third , ” he said . “ I intend to seek negotiated cuts with Russia to move beyond Cold War nuclear postures ” and to work with NATO allies for “ bold reductions in Europe . ”
“ We can forge a new international framework for peaceful nuclear power , reject the nuclear weaponization that North Korea and Iran may be seeking , ” he added .

In another big speech in a major European city , in Prague during the spring of 2009 , Obama set an even more ambitious long-term goal : “ a world without nuclear weapons. ” It ’ s a hope he ’ s reiterated since , including at last year ’ s Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul , and one in which he ’ s said he still believes .
Obama spent much of his speech Wednesday leaning on Kennedy ’ s “ Ich bin ein Berliner ” speech given 50 years ago next week , as he laid out a vision in which the United States and Germany “ pursue peace and justice not only for our countries , but for all mankind . ”
While remaining “ vigilant ” about terror threats , “ we must move beyond the mindset of perpetual war , ” Obama said , echoing the philosophy he laid out last month in his speech on counterterrorism in the post-post-9/11 era . In the United States , “ that means redoubling our efforts to close the prison at Guantanamo , ” he said to cheers .
“ It means tightly controlling our use of new technology like drones , it means balancing the pursuit of security with the protection of privacy , ” he added , referring to the National Security Agency surveillance programs that have drawn fierce criticism from some Americans — and Germans — in recent weeks . “ And I ’ m confident that balance can be struck . ”
Obama stressed that continuing to fight for civil rights is a key part of living up to Kennedy ’ s legacy . “ As long as walls exist in our hearts to separate us from those who don ’ t look like us , or think like us , or worship as we do , then we ’ re going to have to work harder together to bring those walls of division down , ” he said .

And we will do more , ” he said , hinting at the climate plan he ’ s expected to unveil in July .
As interpreted by Obama , Kennedy ’ s vision also means “ meeting our moral obligations ” by fighting hunger around the world , strengthening public health programs and “ empowering people to build institutions , to abandon the rot of corruption , to create ties with trade , not just aid , both with the West and among the nations that are seeking to rise and increase their capacity because when they succeed , we will be more successful as well . ”
Also looming — but not as direct and acknowledged an influence — was Ronald Reagan ’ s 1987 “ tear down this wall ” speech , and Obama ’ s own 2008 speech in Berlin , which drew a crowd of 200,000 . “ This is our moment , this is our time , ” the then-candidate said nearly five years ago . Tickets for Wednesday ’ s event were intentionally limited to 6,000 — heading off the inevitable comparisons with the 2008 speech — but only about 4,500 people attended .
“ No wall can stand against the yearning of justice , the yearnings for freedom , the yearnings for peace that burns in the human heart , ” Obama said , later adding that “ while I am not the first American president to come to this gate , I ’ m proud to stand on its eastern side to pay tribute to the past . ”

Tickets for Wednesday’s event were intentionally limited to 6,000 — heading off the inevitable comparisons with the 2008 speech — but only about 4,500 people attended.

“No wall can stand against the yearning of justice, the yearnings for freedom, the yearnings for peace that burns in the human heart,” Obama said, later adding that “while I am not the first American president to come to this gate, I’m proud to stand on its eastern side to pay tribute to the past.”

The gate, which has been open since 1989, is “a symbol, the symbol of freedom” for Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel said in her introduction of Obama.",www.politico.com,left,0WcOF9wyJlHo1lMh

In Washington scandals, the question is usually what the White House knew.

But in the case of former CIA Director David Petraeus, lawmakers are asking why President Obama did not know about a federal investigation that had found evidence Petraeus was having an affair.

""Once the FBI realized that it was investigating the director of the CIA or the CIA director had come within its focus or its scope, I believe at that time they had an absolute obligation to tell the president ... not to protect David Petraeus, but to protect the president,"" Rep.

""In fact, if they had notified the White House while this investigation was ongoing, you'd hear howls from members of Congress that this investigation might have been politicized.""

There's another reason for not sharing leads more widely, Miller said. Sometimes when the FBI investigates, the allegations don't pan out, or they don't merit any criminal charges. Two law enforcement sources tell NPR that appears to be the case here.

The White House says Obama was first briefed on the case last Thursday, even though federal investigators started looking into what would become the Petraeus case about six months ago.

The FBI inquiry started with a woman in Florida, who socializes with the Petraeus family. She told a friend in the Tampa FBI office that she had received some bothersome, anonymous email messages. Investigators on the trail of possible cyber-harassment traced the messages to Paula Broadwell, author of a biography of Petraeus. And in an email account, the FBI found communications that depicted an affair between Petraeus and Broadwell.

Gen. Ronald Burgess , CIA Director David Petraeus and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testify on Capitol Hill in Washington on Feb. 2 , 2012 , before the House Intelligence Committee hearing on worldwide threats . 6 questions on Petraeus 's exit
Resignations over scandals often raise more questions than they answer , and that ’ s true of Gen. David Petraeus ’ s abrupt exit from the Central Intelligence Agency .
Some have already been put to rest : Paula Broadwell , the co-author of “ All In : The Education of David Petraeus , ” has been identified as the woman at the center of the FBI email probe that ultimately toppled him .
The Obama administration ’ s first sex scandal exploded just three days after the president was reelected at the end of a hard-fought campaign and just days before Petraeus was scheduled to appear at a congressional hearing about the attacks in Benghazi , Libya .
The White House says no one there knew about the Petraeus situation before Wednesday and the president himself was informed Thursday . But if the story had broken a week earlier , those headlines would have overtaken much of the president ’ s message about the middle class and his work in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy . Who made the decision to wait , and why , is going to be the subject of scrutiny as this scandal continues to unfold .
Petraeus ’ s departure now has also thrown a whole new pile of grist into the Benghazi controversy . Already , the attack that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others was being called an intelligence failure — both the failure to anticipate it and the decision to identify it as a riot rather than a terrorist attack .
Acting CIA Director Michael Morell , Petraeus ’ s deputy , will go to the Hill instead for Thursday ’ s hearing . But already , there ’ s a clear sense that going public with his affair and resigning from his job isn ’ t enough to get Petraeus off the hook .
“ David Petraeus testifying has nothing to do with whether or not he ’ s still the CIA director , and I don ’ t see how the CIA can say he ’ s not going to testify , ” House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Peter King ( R-N.Y. ) told CNN . “ He was at the center of this , and he has answers that only he has . ”
The FBI ’ s toppling of the CIA director seems like the ultimate in intelligence sibling rivalries . It didn ’ t start that way .
The Washington Post reported Saturday that the FBI investigation began because a woman close to Petraeus sought protection after receiving several threatening emails from Broadwell . After a deeper look at the general ’ s personal email account , there were initially questions about whether it had been hacked . But investigators soon concluded from the content of the emails that they were evidence of an affair between Petraeus and Broadwell . According to the Post , weeks of probing culminated Tuesday , when Director of National Intelligence James Clapper was told that compromising material had been found . Clapper subsequently told Petraeus to resign .
A senior intelligence official denied reports that Clapper ordered Petraeus to resign but acknowledged that Clapper pushed the CIA director in that direction .
“ Director Clapper urged Director Petraeus to step down . He was doing that as a friend , as a colleague , as a fellow retired general officer and as an admirer , ” said the senior official , who asked not to be named . “ This was a conversation between two friends and colleagues . ”
The official declined to discuss why Clapper thought Petraeus should resign .
The Post report opens up other questions : Who was the woman who received the emails from Broadwell ? What was sent from Petraeus ’ s account ? Was there broader access to his email , as indicated by other reports ? And beyond the emails indicating an affair , was there any indication of impropriety on Petraeus ’ s part ?
Especially in the wake of the WikiLeaks scandal , the military and the intelligence agencies have been taking new measures to shore up security , which includes additional tracing and logging to track things like information being moved to personal email accounts .
A government official who asked not to be named told ███ on Friday that the probe that led to Petraeus ’ s resignation arose out of another investigation . The official would not be more specific .
Additionally , The New York Times reported over the weekend that House Majority Leader Eric Cantor ( R-Va. ) spoke two weeks ago to an FBI whistleblower who accused the CIA director of having an affair and potentially jeopardizing the security of classified information . And Cantor ’ s chief of staff , Steve Stombres , later spoke with FBI officials to pass on the accusations .
3 . Did Petraeus think the story was about to leak ?
Petraeus appears to have successfully kept the situation quiet for months , if not longer . He had known all that time that he was violating the moral and professional code that he cited in his message to CIA employees Friday . And he knew for weeks that the FBI was looking into the situation .
The larger circumstances of the election and next week ’ s hearing might be purely coincidental . Members of Congress were this week informed of the situation , and that ’ s a tried and tested way for information , especially juicy information , to leak out . Add to that their frustration at not being told until now , and the possibilities increase exponentially .
The FBI had been asking questions , too . That created a dilemma for a man whose professional rise has been intertwined with his sterling personal standing : Should he risk being hounded by a story someone else defined , or step forward for the fall himself by getting out ahead of it and trying to take control ?
And those aren ’ t the only options for who might have spoken up . Both Petraeus and Broadwell are married with wide networks of friends and acquaintances who might have discovered what was going on . In a situation as tabloid-friendly as this — high-profile government official with a reputation to rival G.I . Joe ’ s , intelligence tie-in , journalistic compromise — it wouldn ’ t have taken much to stoke the fires .
Members of Congress haven ’ t said much beyond a few press releases praising Petraeus that went out Friday afternoon . But they ’ re more than a little frustrated that they didn ’ t learn about the affair and the investigation until this week .
Still , the FBI has said this wasn ’ t a criminal investigation of Petraeus . If Petraeus hadn ’ t done anything actionable to warrant dismissal , then members will have to explain what they think should have been reported . Should they have been told there was a possibility that the CIA director ’ s email had been hacked and that he might be in a compromising situation ?
“ We were told they were not going after Petraeus and they sort of came across it in some unrelated fashion , ” said one congressional staffer , who asked not to be named .
The staffer said intelligence committee members would expect to know if the CIA director himself were being probed , but that doesn ’ t sound like what was happening here — at least initially .
“ If they were investigating Petraeus directly , of course , they would have to let the committee know , ” the aide said . “ It depends how they came across it and when . ”
Steve Aftergood , who studies intelligence issues for the Federation of American Scientists , noted that by law Congress must be informed about “ significant intelligence activities or failures , but ‘ significant ’ is left undefined and in the eye of the beholder . ”
“ Beyond the letter of the law , there ’ s a prudential obligation to keep the committees ahead of the curve and , evidently , they don ’ t feel that job was fulfilled in this case , ” Aftergood said . “ There ’ s also a question of whether it ’ s wise to inform more people about the existence of the investigation when you ’ re not sure where it ’ s headed . I ’ m not absolutely certain the FBI should have gone to Congress earlier . ”
Aftergood noted that what the situation might boil down to is that “ anything affecting the CIA director is of interest . ”
At another moment , perhaps the CIA director could have admitted having an affair and survived .
But this isn ’ t the best time for an intelligence community scandal . The election is over and Mitt Romney failed to weigh Obama down by claiming intelligence failures in the attack on the consulate in Libya . But the questions about what happened there remain , and immediately colored Petraeus ’ s departure .
There seems to have been some lag between when the CIA got information about the attack and when that information was circulated . That appears to have been what U.N . Ambassador Susan Rice was drawing from in her statements the weekend after the violence about the investigation still centering on a riot rather than a planned attack . Between that and other questions about CIA performance before and after the four Americans were killed , there was intense pressure on the agency even before the director ’ s sudden departure .
Some of the questions that will be asked about Petraeus now that the affair is known will be about his conduct during this time . But some of them will be about whether the public relations aspect of this caused what a number of people in the intelligence community might see as a disproportionate response in forcing out a decorated general and director of the agency for cheating on his wife .
Obama was told about the situation Thursday but didn ’ t accept the resignation until Friday . He may ultimately have concluded that dealing with this on top of the Benghazi mess would have been too much .
“ We all will make mistakes , ” Broadwell wrote as No . 5 in her list of Petraeus ’ s “ Rules for Living ” published on The Daily Beast on Nov. 5 . “ The key is to recognize them and admit them , to learn from them , and to take off the rear-view mirrors — drive on and avoid making them again . ”
Now the question is whether Petraeus lived by that rule himself .
Bending and breaking the truth is part of having an affair — to avoid embarrassment or getting caught .
For intelligence officials , trust is essential , which is why the CIA tends to treat liaisons much more seriously when there ’ s lying involved .
That ’ s even more the case for the person who ’ s in charge at Langley , whose minute-by-minute schedule isn ’ t just of higher concern but also subject to more scrutiny . In a moment of heightened attention on what the CIA knew and when they knew it , there ’ s even less room for error .","From left, Defense Intelligence Agency Director Army Lt. Gen.

Resignations over scandals often raise more questions than they answer, and that’s true of Gen. David Petraeus’s abrupt exit from the Central Intelligence Agency.

Some have already been put to rest: Paula Broadwell, the co-author of “All In: The Education of David Petraeus,” has been identified as the woman at the center of the FBI email probe that ultimately toppled him.

But many questions remain.

Here are POLITICO’s six most important:

1. Why resign now?

The Obama administration’s first sex scandal exploded just three days after the president was reelected at the end of a hard-fought campaign and just days before Petraeus was scheduled to appear at a congressional hearing about the attacks in Benghazi, Libya.

The White House says no one there knew about the Petraeus situation before Wednesday and the president himself was informed Thursday. But if the story had broken a week earlier, those headlines would have overtaken much of the president’s message about the middle class and his work in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. Who made the decision to wait, and why, is going to be the subject of scrutiny as this scandal continues to unfold.

( Also on POLITICO: No pass for Petraeus)

Petraeus’s departure now has also thrown a whole new pile of grist into the Benghazi controversy. Already, the attack that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others was being called an intelligence failure — both the failure to anticipate it and the decision to identify it as a riot rather than a terrorist attack.

Acting CIA Director Michael Morell, Petraeus’s deputy, will go to the Hill instead for Thursday’s hearing. But already, there’s a clear sense that going public with his affair and resigning from his job isn’t enough to get Petraeus off the hook.

“David Petraeus testifying has nothing to do with whether or not he’s still the CIA director, and I don’t see how the CIA can say he’s not going to testify,” House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Peter King (R-N.Y.) told CNN. “He was at the center of this, and he has answers that only he has.”

2. What else was part of the FBI probe?

The FBI’s toppling of the CIA director seems like the ultimate in intelligence sibling rivalries. It didn’t start that way.

The Washington Post reported Saturday that the FBI investigation began because a woman close to Petraeus sought protection after receiving several threatening emails from Broadwell. After a deeper look at the general’s personal email account, there were initially questions about whether it had been hacked. But investigators soon concluded from the content of the emails that they were evidence of an affair between Petraeus and Broadwell. According to the Post, weeks of probing culminated Tuesday, when Director of National Intelligence James Clapper was told that compromising material had been found. Clapper subsequently told Petraeus to resign.

( Also on POLITICO: A long fall for Gen. Petraeus)

A senior intelligence official denied reports that Clapper ordered Petraeus to resign but acknowledged that Clapper pushed the CIA director in that direction.

“Director Clapper urged Director Petraeus to step down. He was doing that as a friend, as a colleague, as a fellow retired general officer and as an admirer,” said the senior official, who asked not to be named. “This was a conversation between two friends and colleagues.”

The official declined to discuss why Clapper thought Petraeus should resign.

The Post report opens up other questions: Who was the woman who received the emails from Broadwell? What was sent from Petraeus’s account? Was there broader access to his email, as indicated by other reports? And beyond the emails indicating an affair, was there any indication of impropriety on Petraeus’s part?

Especially in the wake of the WikiLeaks scandal, the military and the intelligence agencies have been taking new measures to shore up security, which includes additional tracing and logging to track things like information being moved to personal email accounts.

A government official who asked not to be named told POLITICO on Friday that the probe that led to Petraeus’s resignation arose out of another investigation. The official would not be more specific.

Additionally, The New York Times reported over the weekend that House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) spoke two weeks ago to an FBI whistleblower who accused the CIA director of having an affair and potentially jeopardizing the security of classified information. And Cantor’s chief of staff, Steve Stombres, later spoke with FBI officials to pass on the accusations.

3. Did Petraeus think the story was about to leak?

Petraeus appears to have successfully kept the situation quiet for months, if not longer. He had known all that time that he was violating the moral and professional code that he cited in his message to CIA employees Friday. And he knew for weeks that the FBI was looking into the situation.

But something made him come forward now.

The larger circumstances of the election and next week’s hearing might be purely coincidental. Members of Congress were this week informed of the situation, and that’s a tried and tested way for information, especially juicy information, to leak out. Add to that their frustration at not being told until now, and the possibilities increase exponentially.

The FBI had been asking questions, too. That created a dilemma for a man whose professional rise has been intertwined with his sterling personal standing: Should he risk being hounded by a story someone else defined, or step forward for the fall himself by getting out ahead of it and trying to take control?

And those aren’t the only options for who might have spoken up. Both Petraeus and Broadwell are married with wide networks of friends and acquaintances who might have discovered what was going on. In a situation as tabloid-friendly as this — high-profile government official with a reputation to rival G.I. Joe’s, intelligence tie-in, journalistic compromise — it wouldn’t have taken much to stoke the fires.

4. Why weren’t Obama and congressional committees told earlier?

Members of Congress haven’t said much beyond a few press releases praising Petraeus that went out Friday afternoon. But they’re more than a little frustrated that they didn’t learn about the affair and the investigation until this week.

Still, the FBI has said this wasn’t a criminal investigation of Petraeus. If Petraeus hadn’t done anything actionable to warrant dismissal, then members will have to explain what they think should have been reported. Should they have been told there was a possibility that the CIA director’s email had been hacked and that he might be in a compromising situation?

“We were told they were not going after Petraeus and they sort of came across it in some unrelated fashion,” said one congressional staffer, who asked not to be named.

The staffer said intelligence committee members would expect to know if the CIA director himself were being probed, but that doesn’t sound like what was happening here — at least initially.

“If they were investigating Petraeus directly, of course, they would have to let the committee know,” the aide said. “It depends how they came across it and when.”

Steve Aftergood, who studies intelligence issues for the Federation of American Scientists, noted that by law Congress must be informed about “significant intelligence activities or failures, but ‘significant’ is left undefined and in the eye of the beholder.”

“Beyond the letter of the law, there’s a prudential obligation to keep the committees ahead of the curve and, evidently, they don’t feel that job was fulfilled in this case,” Aftergood said. “There’s also a question of whether it’s wise to inform more people about the existence of the investigation when you’re not sure where it’s headed. I’m not absolutely certain the FBI should have gone to Congress earlier.”

Aftergood noted that what the situation might boil down to is that “anything affecting the CIA director is of interest.”

5. What role, if any, did Benghazi play?

At another moment, perhaps the CIA director could have admitted having an affair and survived.

But this isn’t the best time for an intelligence community scandal. The election is over and Mitt Romney failed to weigh Obama down by claiming intelligence failures in the attack on the consulate in Libya. But the questions about what happened there remain, and immediately colored Petraeus’s departure.

There seems to have been some lag between when the CIA got information about the attack and when that information was circulated. That appears to have been what U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice was drawing from in her statements the weekend after the violence about the investigation still centering on a riot rather than a planned attack. Between that and other questions about CIA performance before and after the four Americans were killed, there was intense pressure on the agency even before the director’s sudden departure.

Some of the questions that will be asked about Petraeus now that the affair is known will be about his conduct during this time. But some of them will be about whether the public relations aspect of this caused what a number of people in the intelligence community might see as a disproportionate response in forcing out a decorated general and director of the agency for cheating on his wife.

Obama was told about the situation Thursday but didn’t accept the resignation until Friday. He may ultimately have concluded that dealing with this on top of the Benghazi mess would have been too much.

6. Did Petraeus make the situation worse?

“We all will make mistakes,” Broadwell wrote as No. 5 in her list of Petraeus’s “Rules for Living” published on The Daily Beast on Nov. 5. “The key is to recognize them and admit them, to learn from them, and to take off the rear-view mirrors — drive on and avoid making them again.”

Now the question is whether Petraeus lived by that rule himself.

Bending and breaking the truth is part of having an affair — to avoid embarrassment or getting caught.

For intelligence officials, trust is essential, which is why the CIA tends to treat liaisons much more seriously when there’s lying involved.

That’s even more the case for the person who’s in charge at Langley, whose minute-by-minute schedule isn’t just of higher concern but also subject to more scrutiny. In a moment of heightened attention on what the CIA knew and when they knew it, there’s even less room for error.

President Barack Obama ’ s decision to nominate Chuck Hagel as secretary of defense has mystified lawmakers from both parties .
Democrats don ’ t love the former Nebraska senator because he ’ s a Republican . Republicans don ’ t think he ’ s a real Republican . And his past statements have at times angered two key Obama constituencies : Jewish groups and gay-rights activists .
But inside the White House , the choice makes sense . It appeals to Obama ’ s bipartisan spirit — and the optics aren ’ t bad , either — to have any Republican as Defense secretary when Obama is seeking to end the war in Afghanistan and dramatically reduce the Pentagon ’ s budget . Hagel brings even more credibility to the task because he ’ s a decorated Vietnam veteran and would be the first from that war to lead the Pentagon .
Hagel also has long-standing relationships with Obama and Vice President Joe Biden dating to their time in the Senate , and he ’ s a particularly close friend of Biden ’ s .
Defense isn ’ t the first high-level post the White House has discussed with Hagel : An individual who speaks regularly with Hagel said the White House has spoken with him about becoming Commerce secretary and CIA director , among other jobs . During Obama ’ s first term , Hagel has been in regular contact with the White House on foreign policy issues as co-chairman of Obama ’ s Intelligence Advisory Board and a member of outgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta ’ s Defense Policy Board .
There ’ s still no evidence that any Democratic senators will vote against an Obama-nominated Hagel , and tradition holds that senators get an easy ride when up for Cabinet posts . Despite the vocal objections of a few GOP senators , only three have explicitly said they will vote against Hagel .
Hagel cost himself capital among Republicans for bucking party orthodoxy , but the White House is prepared for a fight over the GOP ’ s past foreign policy positions .
“ If at the end of the day these guys are frustrated that he had the courage to buck his party on the Iraq War , that ’ s going to be a tough case to make to the American people , ” White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said .
Longtime Obama confidant and political adviser David Axelrod tweeted Sunday night that “ Attacks on Hagel r bogus . He ’ s tough , courageous , sensible & able to withstand political pressure to do what ’ s right for USA . What we need ! ”
Mike Buttry , Hagel ’ s former chief of staff , previewed how Hagel might defend himself against criticism by GOP senators during the confirmation process . Buttry said Hagel is “ not blind ” to the opposition to his nomination .
“ He always just did what he thought was right . He always was trying to do what he thought was the right thing and never gave much thought into how it might be received , ” Buttry told ███ Sunday . “ He ’ s thinking about , ‘ What do I have to do to do this job the best way I can do it ? ’ ”
Both Obama and Biden have traveled to war zones with Hagel — Obama during his summer 2008 Iraq and Afghanistan trips as the Democratic presidential nominee . But Hagel ’ s relationship with Biden runs much deeper and is more personal , a result of their 12-year bond from serving together in the Senate , including on the Foreign Relations Committee , Buttry said .
“ They ’ re just friends , they ’ re very close , ” Buttry said of Hagel and Biden . “ They ’ ve traveled together , their families get along . There ’ s just a closeness there . They ’ ve worked on legislation together . It ’ s like any kind of friendship , they ’ re just two guys who clicked together . ”
For the White House , the political dynamics surrounding the Hagel nomination are different than those for Susan Rice , another longtime friend of Obama who removed herself from consideration for secretary of state in December , she said , to spare the president . She was concerned Republican anger over her role in the Benghazi attacks would distract from his second-term agenda .
“ It was clear from early on that many in Congress , especially Republicans , were going to make a witch hunt and an example out of Susan Rice , ” a person close to Obama said . “ I think that the Rice case was obviously a case where it would seemingly have been an insurmountable challenge . ”
White House officials said Hagel has a clearer path toward confirmation . Still , a major fight over Hagel could lead to many of the same distractions Rice sought to avoid — tripping up other major items on the president ’ s agenda , including immigration , the economy and now gun control .
Obama has made the calculation that the long-term benefits are worth the immediate battle .
The White House believes Hagel ’ s Senate record will overcome trouble about controversial statements Hagel has made , such as his 2006 reference to a “ Jewish lobby. ” Talking points dated Dec. 19 — written and being circulated in Washington by Hagel allies — say he has “ an unbroken record of substantive support for Israel . ”
Axelrod wrote Sunday that “ supporters of Israel , of which I am one , also make a huge mistake by depicting Hagel as hostile . No such evidence in his record . ”
Democrats also are counting on a bipartisan tradition with regard to foreign policy . Obama ’ s New START agreement , which reduced the number of nuclear missile launchers in the United States and Russia , won 71 votes during the 2010 lame duck session .
A Democratic official who believes Hagel will be confirmed stressed that once he is formally nominated , the Nebraskan will have enthusiastic support from veterans organizations . Hagel would be the first defense secretary who served as an enlisted man — an idea that will be popular with the troops , the official said , and Hagel ’ s defenders are sure to emphasize that he earned two Purple Hearts and still carries shrapnel in his chest .
That record , Obama ’ s allies say , gives Hagel credibility as a leader who can cut Pentagon spending and bring home American troops from overseas .
“ This is a challenging time in the world , and there are going to be tough cuts that need to be made , ” said Jen Psaki , Obama ’ s campaign spokeswoman . “ One of the tasks of the next secretary of defense is to see that through , and clearly Mr. Hagel is somebody who has been through it . He ’ s been there on the front lines , he ’ s been there in prominent positions in Congress on the Foreign Relations Committee , and he has the reputation of having the balance needed for this job . ”
White House officials said they are not concerned that Hagel ’ s 1998 comments about James Hormel , an openly gay nominee to be President Bill Clinton ’ s U.S. ambassador to Luxembourg , will trouble Hagel ’ s confirmation , given his recent apology for them . Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin said last month that he accepted Hagel ’ s words of regret .
Vietor said Sunday that Hagel is not alone in having changed his position on gay issues .
“ I think that a lot of people have had their views evolve on LGBT issues over the last 20 years , ” Vietor said . “ At the time he made those comments , you had a Democratic president sign ‘ don ’ t ask , don ’ t tell ’ and [ the Defense of Marriage Act ] into law . ”
On Capitol Hill , both Democrats and Republicans questioned the Hagel strategy , asking why Obama would go to the wall for a Republican but allow momentum against Rice to build past the point of no return .
“ It is a strange signal for the White House to send that they are willing to fight for Hagel but not Rice , ” one Senate Democratic aide said . “ Democrats are not currently unified behind Hagel , and it will take some real work by the administration to get them there , if it ’ s even possible . ”
Senior Republicans said there is no natural base for Hagel despite his years in the Senate .
“ I can ’ t imagine why [ Obama ] would choose to burn his political capital on this nomination . For what ? There is no constituency for Chuck Hagel , ” one senior GOP aide said . “ Obama will expend every ounce of political capital he has to get him across the finish line . Dems will hate this . ”
Allies of Obama and Hagel said Sunday that only a few GOP senators — John Cornyn and Ted Cruz of Texas and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma — have committed to voting against Hagel ’ s confirmation , though Lindsey Graham of South Carolina also expressed strong reservations .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky pledged a “ fair hearing ” for Hagel , passing on opportunities to denounce his nomination or his past statements about Israel .
“ I think he ought to be given a fair hearing like any other nominee , and he will be , ” McConnell said on ABC ’ s “ This Week. ” “ I ’ m going to wait and see how the hearings go and whether Chuck ’ s views square with the job he would be nominated to do . ”
Axelrod ’ s Sunday posts on Twitter reminded McConnell of his own past comments .
“ McConnell was right a few years [ ago ] when he called Hagel ‘ a great statesmen , ’ ” Axelrod wrote .","The Hagel decision appeals to Obama's bipartisan spirit. Why Obama picked Hagel

Democrats don’t love the former Nebraska senator because he’s a Republican. Republicans don’t think he’s a real Republican. And his past statements have at times angered two key Obama constituencies: Jewish groups and gay-rights activists.

But inside the White House, the choice makes sense. It appeals to Obama’s bipartisan spirit — and the optics aren’t bad, either — to have any Republican as Defense secretary when Obama is seeking to end the war in Afghanistan and dramatically reduce the Pentagon’s budget. Hagel brings even more credibility to the task because he’s a decorated Vietnam veteran and would be the first from that war to lead the Pentagon.

Hagel also has long-standing relationships with Obama and Vice President Joe Biden dating to their time in the Senate, and he’s a particularly close friend of Biden’s.

Defense isn’t the first high-level post the White House has discussed with Hagel: An individual who speaks regularly with Hagel said the White House has spoken with him about becoming Commerce secretary and CIA director, among other jobs. During Obama’s first term, Hagel has been in regular contact with the White House on foreign policy issues as co-chairman of Obama’s Intelligence Advisory Board and a member of outgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta’s Defense Policy Board.

And the White House thinks he will win confirmation.

There’s still no evidence that any Democratic senators will vote against an Obama-nominated Hagel, and tradition holds that senators get an easy ride when up for Cabinet posts. Despite the vocal objections of a few GOP senators, only three have explicitly said they will vote against Hagel.

Hagel cost himself capital among Republicans for bucking party orthodoxy, but the White House is prepared for a fight over the GOP’s past foreign policy positions.

“If at the end of the day these guys are frustrated that he had the courage to buck his party on the Iraq War, that’s going to be a tough case to make to the American people,” White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said.

Mike Buttry, Hagel’s former chief of staff, previewed how Hagel might defend himself against criticism by GOP senators during the confirmation process. Buttry said Hagel is “not blind” to the opposition to his nomination.

“He always just did what he thought was right. He always was trying to do what he thought was the right thing and never gave much thought into how it might be received,” Buttry told POLITICO Sunday. “He’s thinking about, ‘What do I have to do to do this job the best way I can do it?’”

White House officials said Hagel has a clearer path toward confirmation. Still, a major fight over Hagel could lead to many of the same distractions Rice sought to avoid — tripping up other major items on the president’s agenda, including immigration, the economy and now gun control.

Obama has made the calculation that the long-term benefits are worth the immediate battle.

The White House believes Hagel’s Senate record will overcome trouble about controversial statements Hagel has made, such as his 2006 reference to a “Jewish lobby.” Talking points dated Dec. 19 — written and being circulated in Washington by Hagel allies — say he has “an unbroken record of substantive support for Israel.”

Axelrod wrote Sunday that “supporters of Israel, of which I am one, also make a huge mistake by depicting Hagel as hostile. No such evidence in his record.”

Democrats also are counting on a bipartisan tradition with regard to foreign policy. Obama’s New START agreement, which reduced the number of nuclear missile launchers in the United States and Russia, won 71 votes during the 2010 lame duck session.

A Democratic official who believes Hagel will be confirmed stressed that once he is formally nominated, the Nebraskan will have enthusiastic support from veterans organizations. Hagel would be the first defense secretary who served as an enlisted man — an idea that will be popular with the troops, the official said, and Hagel’s defenders are sure to emphasize that he earned two Purple Hearts and still carries shrapnel in his chest.

That record, Obama’s allies say, gives Hagel credibility as a leader who can cut Pentagon spending and bring home American troops from overseas.

“This is a challenging time in the world, and there are going to be tough cuts that need to be made,” said Jen Psaki, Obama’s campaign spokeswoman. “One of the tasks of the next secretary of defense is to see that through, and clearly Mr. Hagel is somebody who has been through it. He’s been there on the front lines, he’s been there in prominent positions in Congress on the Foreign Relations Committee, and he has the reputation of having the balance needed for this job.”

White House officials said they are not concerned that Hagel’s 1998 comments about James Hormel, an openly gay nominee to be President Bill Clinton’s U.S. ambassador to Luxembourg, will trouble Hagel’s confirmation, given his recent apology for them. Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin said last month that he accepted Hagel’s words of regret.

Vietor said Sunday that Hagel is not alone in having changed his position on gay issues.

“I think that a lot of people have had their views evolve on LGBT issues over the last 20 years,” Vietor said. “At the time he made those comments, you had a Democratic president sign ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ and [the Defense of Marriage Act] into law.”

On Capitol Hill, both Democrats and Republicans questioned the Hagel strategy, asking why Obama would go to the wall for a Republican but allow momentum against Rice to build past the point of no return.

“It is a strange signal for the White House to send that they are willing to fight for Hagel but not Rice,” one Senate Democratic aide said. “Democrats are not currently unified behind Hagel, and it will take some real work by the administration to get them there, if it’s even possible.”

Senior Republicans said there is no natural base for Hagel despite his years in the Senate.

“I can’t imagine why [Obama] would choose to burn his political capital on this nomination. For what? There is no constituency for Chuck Hagel,” one senior GOP aide said. “Obama will expend every ounce of political capital he has to get him across the finish line. Dems will hate this.”

Allies of Obama and Hagel said Sunday that only a few GOP senators — John Cornyn and Ted Cruz of Texas and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma — have committed to voting against Hagel’s confirmation, though Lindsey Graham of South Carolina also expressed strong reservations.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky pledged a “fair hearing” for Hagel, passing on opportunities to denounce his nomination or his past statements about Israel.

“I think he ought to be given a fair hearing like any other nominee, and he will be,” McConnell said on ABC’s “This Week.” “I’m going to wait and see how the hearings go and whether Chuck’s views square with the job he would be nominated to do.”

Axelrod’s Sunday posts on Twitter reminded McConnell of his own past comments.

“McConnell was right a few years [ago] when he called Hagel ‘a great statesmen,’” Axelrod wrote.

Marine Corps Gen. Thomas Waldhauser , the White House ’ s pick to lead U.S. Africa Command , called for increased American military action in Libya to ensure the Islamic State , or ISIS or ISIL , does not reconstitute itself in the country as pressure ramps up against its strongholds in Iraq and Syria .
Gen. Waldhauser told a Senate Armed Services Committee confirmation hearing Tuesday that U.S. military planners were drafting up battle plans for airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Libya , Reuters reported . The fledgling unity government in Tripoli has enjoyed surprising success in recent weeks in a campaign against the Islamic State ’ s stronghold in the coastal city of Sirte .
But rules of engagement for U.S. forces in Libya , which require White House approval for any offensive operations in the country , have hamstrung American military planners in the region , according to the report .
Aside from clandestine drone strikes launched from NATO bases in southern Europe and small rotations of U.S. special operations teams working with local militias in Libya , the Pentagon has not conducted any large-scale military mission in the country since the cancellation of a failed train-and-advise operation late last year .
Asked by Sen. Lindsey Graham , South Carolina Republican , whether the White House should give U.S. commanders more leeway in going after the Islamic State in Libya , the four-star general responded : “ It would be wise . It would certainly contribute to what we ’ re trying to do inside Libya . ”
Gen. Waldhauser was not the first American combatant commander to call for an increased military role for U.S. forces in Libya . U.S. Central Command chief Gen. Joseph Votel told lawmakers during his confirmation hearing earlier this year that he supported restarting the U.S.-led training mission in the country .
In May , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford told reporters that an agreement with Libya ’ s Government of National Accord , the U.N.-recognized governing body in the country , to open the door for new U.S. operations in the country was weeks from being ratified . At the time , Gen. Dunford said the situation in Libya had deteriorated to the point where Washington and the international community had little choice but to act .
“ They want assistance , [ and ] you know that a number of countries , including the United States , are prepared to do that , ” Gen. Dunford said in May . The only thing preventing U.S. officials from going forward was determining whether or not local forces could coalesce around the nascent Libyan government , he noted .
The Libyans ’ success in Sirte has changed the calculus . U.S. officials expect the city to fall to government forces within days , Col. Chris Garver , the top U.S. military spokesman for anti-Islamic State operations , said .
Gen. Waldhauser said Tuesday the surprising success of Libyan forces against Islamic State has created an opportunity for American forces to conduct operations in Libya , which Islamic State views as a fallback should it lose more ground in Iraq and Syria .
But the White House , wary of pursuing a new military engagement in the region so close to the end of President Obama ’ s final term in office , has adopted a wait-and-see approach . Some administration officials even argue that the events in Sirte are proof U.S. military intervention isn ’ t needed .
Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said the Pentagon would be willing to conduct additional airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Libya , telling reporters on Tuesday the department has never shied away from such operations in the past .
“ We ’ ve been willing to take strikes in the past in Libya targeting ISIL leadership , ” he said . “ We are prepared to do so again in the future . But this is a situation where the government … is showing progress [ and ] military forces aligned with the government are showing progress . ”
While pockets of the city remain contested , images of Libyan militiamen , mostly from the western city of Misurata , celebrating in the streets of Sirte began circulating through social media as forces reportedly closed to within yards of the Islamic State-held city center as militants fled their positions throughout the city .
“ The most encouraging thing we see right now are the actual actions on the ground … and the progress [ Libya ] has been making on their own to take out ISIL , ” Mr. Cook said .
However , Mr. Cook continued to balk at the idea that a more aggressive U.S. military approach isn ’ t needed .
“ Only in consultation with the [ Libyan government ] and the partners in the region will we have a better sense of what [ the ] security needs are going forward and what role , if any , [ the U.S. ] would need to play , ” he added .
“ An ideal situation [ would be ] for the U.S. military not to be involved , ” he added . “ We understand that that ’ s not necessarily how this is going to play out . ”
Libyan Prime Minister Fayez Seraj made similar suggestions on a possible role for U.S. troops in the country as local forces closed in on Sirte earlier this month . Senior White House officials , however , are adamant that expanded U.S. military engagement is a bridge too far .
Vice President Joseph R. Biden , who was vehemently opposed to the U.S. role in the 2011 NATO campaign that helped oust longtime strongman Moammar Gadhafi , said Monday that the situation in the country illustrates the drawbacks of direct military intervention .
“ My question was , ‘ OK , tell me what happens . He ’ s gone . What happens ? Doesn ’ t the country disintegrate ? What happens then ? ” Mr. Biden said in an interview with Charlie Rose , recalling the internal debate on whether to support the NATO bombardment .
“ Doesn ’ t it become … a petri dish for the growth of extremism ? And it has , ” Mr. Biden said .
Gen. Waldhauser warned Tuesday that local forces in Libya still had a long way to go to prove their viability to American military commanders .
“ The unpredictable nature of paramilitary group patronage will most likely remain a significant obstacle to [ the government ’ s ] efforts to establish sovereignty , ” he said .","Rifts have emerged between U.S. military leaders and the Obama White House on Washington’s future role in Libya, with the generals questioning the White House’s argument that the recent success against Islamic State shows Libya can go it alone in the fight against terrorism, without direct U.S. assistance.

While pockets of the city remain contested, images of Libyan militiamen, mostly from the western city of Misurata, celebrating in the streets of Sirte began circulating through social media as forces reportedly closed to within yards of the Islamic State-held city center as militants fled their positions throughout the city.

“The most encouraging thing we see right now are the actual actions on the ground … and the progress [Libya] has been making on their own to take out ISIL,” Mr. Cook said.

However, Mr. Cook continued to balk at the idea that a more aggressive U.S. military approach isn’t needed.

“Only in consultation with the [Libyan government] and the partners in the region will we have a better sense of what [the] security needs are going forward and what role, if any, [the U.S.] would need to play,” he added.

“An ideal situation [would be] for the U.S. military not to be involved,” he added. “We understand that that’s not necessarily how this is going to play out.”

Libyan Prime Minister Fayez Seraj made similar suggestions on a possible role for U.S. troops in the country as local forces closed in on Sirte earlier this month. Senior White House officials, however, are adamant that expanded U.S. military engagement is a bridge too far.

Vice President Joseph R. Biden, who was vehemently opposed to the U.S. role in the 2011 NATO campaign that helped oust longtime strongman Moammar Gadhafi, said Monday that the situation in the country illustrates the drawbacks of direct military intervention.

“My question was, ‘OK, tell me what happens. He’s gone. What happens? Doesn’t the country disintegrate? What happens then?” Mr. Biden said in an interview with Charlie Rose, recalling the internal debate on whether to support the NATO bombardment.

“Doesn’t it become … a petri dish for the growth of extremism? And it has,” Mr. Biden said.

Gen. Waldhauser warned Tuesday that local forces in Libya still had a long way to go to prove their viability to American military commanders.

“The unpredictable nature of paramilitary group patronage will most likely remain a significant obstacle to [the government’s] efforts to establish sovereignty,” he said.

The Strategic Missile Forces chief , General Sergei Karakayev , said during the call that the Avangard was put on duty with a unit in the Orenburg region in the southern Ural Mountains .

Trump , who did not serve in the Vietnam war after receiving five draft deferments , has long spoken of his admiration for tough military figures such as General George Patton and frequently makes reference to “ my generals ” .
The president was deeply impressed by a parade in Paris on 14 July last year .

It included tanks , armoured vehicles and a flyover of US and French military jets .

The White House confirmed that an event is in the works, though it did not offer further details. “President Trump is incredibly supportive of America’s great service members who risk their lives every day to keep our country safe,” press secretary Sarah Sanders said. “He has asked the Department of Defense to explore a celebration at which all Americans can show their appreciation.”

Trump, who did not serve in the Vietnam war after receiving five draft deferments, has long spoken of his admiration for tough military figures such as General George Patton and frequently makes reference to “my generals”.



The president was deeply impressed by a parade in Paris on 14 July last year. American and French soldiers marched together on the Avenue des Champs-Elysees to mark the centenary of America’s entry into the first world war and France’s annual Bastille Day holiday. It included tanks, armoured vehicles and a flyover of US and French military jets.

Trump told reporters in September: “To a large extent because of what I witnessed, we may do something like that on the Fourth of July in Washington down Pennsylvania Avenue. We’re actually looking into it.”

But not for the first time in Trump’s short political career, such a display is likely to prove divisive. On Tuesday retired general Paul Eaton, senior adviser to VoteVets, a progressive political action committee for military veterans, said: “Donald Trump has continually shown himself to have authoritarian tendencies, and this is just another worrisome example.”

In the past, Eaton noted, Trump has praised the tactics of autocrats such as Saddam Hussein and Vladimir Putin. He added: “Unfortunately, we do not have a commander in chief right now as much as have a wannabe banana republic strongman.”

Richard Painter, former White House ethics lawyer for George W Bush, tweeted: “Cool. Just like in North Korea and Russia. But what do we do about those traitors who don’t clap during our Dear Leader’s speech?” – a reference to Trump’s criticism of Democrats who did not applaud during his state of the union address.

And journalist Joy Reid wrote on Twitter: “Oh my god ... he wants to be Kim Jong-un.”

A date for the event has not yet been chosen. Options include Memorial Day on 28 May, Independence Day on 4 July and Veterans Day on 11 November, which would coincide with the 100th anniversary of the end of the first world war. If the route includes Pennsylvania Avenue, it would pass by Trump’s controversial hotel.

But the Post added: “The cost of shipping Abrams tanks and high-tech hardware to Washington could run in the millions, and military officials said it was unclear how they would pay for it.”

Thomas Crosson, a spokesman for the Pentagon, said: “We are aware of the request and are in the process of determining specific details. We will share more information throughout the planning process.”",www.theguardian.com,left,msA9BR38KqAR5GGI

Veterans' organizations have praised Chuck Hagel, a twice-wounded combat veteran of Vietnam and deputy administrator in President Ronald Reagan's Veterans Administration.

The Veterans of Foreign Wars has called him uniquely qualified to become Pentagon chief. The Military Officers Association of America said his experience gives him ""a range of perspectives."" The American Legion said he was a longtime advocate for veterans.

Republican-leaning outside groups have waged a well-funded campaign against Hagel, airing television commercials, running full-page newspaper ads and expressing their opposition on local radio stations.

Officials from Americans for a Strong Defense, hoping to pressure Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor, spoke out on an Arkansas station this week.

Hagel's first test could come as early as Thursday with a possible vote in the Senate Armed Services Committee.

The committee chairman, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., has said he would like to vote when the committee holds a hearing with Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on last September's deadly attack on the U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya.

Some Republicans on the committee are circulating a letter calling for a delay in the vote until Hagel provides more information about recent speeches, the groups he has addressed and their ties.

""I'm not going to make any decision on Sen. Hagel until we get all the information we've requested,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told a small group of reporters on Wednesday. ""I don't think we should be voting.""

Democrats were working to resolve the last-minute issues.
