But authorities say the charges are just the “ proverbial tip of the iceberg ” and that the man is a “ domestic terrorist , bent on committing acts dangerous to human life . ”
Christopher Paul Hasson , a 49-year-old resident of Silver Spring , Maryland , had stockpiled weapons and ammunition and was allegedly planning to kill a number of prominent Democratic politicians and journalists as well as professors , judges , and “ leftists in general , ” federal prosecutors said in a court filing on Tuesday .
The filing details disturbing allegations , including Hasson ’ s writings about a potential race war , where he asserts that “ much blood will have to be spilled to get whitey off the couch , ” and his study of Anders Breivik , a Norwegian far-right domestic terrorist who killed 77 people in 2011 . Law enforcement agents discovered 15 firearms and more than 1,000 rounds of mixed ammunition when they searched Hasson ’ s home on Friday . Seamus Hughes of George Washington University ’ s Program on Extremism was first to uncover the filing .
Authorities allege that Hasson had created a spreadsheet of potential targets of violence , including Sens . Chuck Schumer , Elizabeth Warren , Cory Booker , Tim Kaine , Kamala Harris , and Richard Blumenthal . He listed Blumenthal as “ Sen blumen jew ” and Warren as “ poca warren , ” presumably a reference to President Donald Trump ’ s nickname for her , “ Pocahontas. ” Other of his targets included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , Ilhan Omar , Sheila Jackson , and Maxine Waters , and journalists Chris Cuomo , Chris Hayes , and Ari Melber .

Authorities say that Hasson conducted internet searches on whether senators and Supreme Court justices have Secret Service protection . They also describe a December 2018 instance in which Hasson looked up MSNBC host and former Rep. Joe Scarborough after seeing a headline where Scarborough called Trump “ the worst ever. ” He looked at Scarborough ’ s Wikipedia page and website and then tried to find where his show was hosted and where he used to live .
In an email draft in 2017 , Hasson wrote that he was “ dreaming of a way to kill almost every last person on the earth ” and discussed ways to carry out his plans .
After racist violence erupted in Charlottesville , Virginia , in 2017 , Hasson sent himself a draft letter — which he allegedly had written to a neo-Nazi leader — identifying himself as a “ long time White Nationalist ” and a “ skinhead ” for more than 30 years . In the letter , he called for a “ white homeland . ”
From January 2017 to January 2019 , authorities say , he conducted searches and made “ thousands of visits ” to websites containing pro-Russian , neo-fascist , and neo-Nazi literature .
It ’ s not clear when or if Hasson intended to carry out his plot . He compiled the list of targets on January 17 , 2019 . The same day , he performed Google searches including “ what if trump illegally impeached , “ best place in dc to see congress people , ” “ where in dc to congress live , ” “ civil war if trump impeached , ” and “ social democrats usa . ”
Hasson appeared to take advice from Breivik ’ s manifesto , which he spent three years creating prior to his attacks . He took cues for creating a list of and categorizing victims and for taking steroids prior to an attack . Agents found more than 30 bottles labeled as human growth hormones in Hasson ’ s residence .
Hasson is expected to appear in federal court on Thursday at 1 pm .
Coast Guard Chief Warrant Officer Barry Lane , a spokesperson for the Coast Guard , said in a statement to multiple media outlets that Hasson ’ s arrest was part of an ongoing probe by the Coast Guard Investigative Service .
“ An active duty Coast Guard member , stationed at Coast Guard Headquarters in Washington , DC , was arrested last week on illegal weapons and drug charges as a result of an ongoing investigation led by the Coast Guard Investigative Service , in cooperation with the FBI and Department of Justice . Because this is an open investigation , the Coast Guard has no further details at this time , ” Lane said .
White nationalist and right-wing domestic terrorism is a major threat in the US
Right-wing extremism is a growing problem in the United States , and threats such as those posed by individuals like Hasson are becoming more common , not less . Take the shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in October , in which 11 people were killed ; the pipe bombs that were sent to multiple prominent politicians the same month ; or the 2017 shooting at a black church in Charleston , South Carolina , that left nine people dead .
According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies , the number of terrorist attacks in the US by far-right perpetrators more than quadrupled between 2016 and 2017 . From 2007 to 2011 , there were five or fewer attacks by right-wing extremists per year . In 2017 , there were 31 . According to the Anti-Defamation League , right-wing extremists were responsible for 71 percent of extremist-related murders from 2008 to 2017 . Islamic extremists were responsible for 26 percent of the killings .
As Janet Reitman explained in the New York Times Magazine in November , law enforcement for years failed to see the threat white nationalism could pose in the US and was instead focused on Islamic extremism . The piece details how a report from a Homeland Security senior intelligence analyst named Daryl Johnson on the rising threat of white nationalism and right-wing extremism was crushed by political backlash . Republicans vehemently objected to descriptions of “ right-wing extremism , ” and DHS withdrew the report .
But report or not , as the Washington Post laid out in November , the problem has only become worse , under President Barack Obama and now Trump :
Terrorism researchers say right-wing violence sprouted alongside white anxiety about Obama ’ s presidency and has accelerated in the Trump era . Trump and his aides have continuously denied that he has contributed to the rise in violence . But experts say right-wing extremists perceive the president as offering them tacit support for their cause . After the violence in Charlottesville , for example , Trump asserted that “ both sides ” were equally to blame and that there were “ some very fine people ” among the far-right demonstrators , many of whom wore “ Make America Great Again ” caps while chanting racist and anti-Semitic slogans .

The issue has dominated the U.S. political conversation during the week since gunmen and suicide bombers terrorized Paris on a Friday night .
All Republican presidential candidates called on President Barack Obama to renege on his pledge to admit 10,000 refugees fleeing Syria 's brutal civil war into the U.S. and argued instead for a full stop , fearing terrorists could infiltrate their ranks .
Thirty-one governors have declared Syrian refugees unwelcome in their states and on Thursday the House passed a bill to bar refugees from Syria and Iraq from entering the U.S. Nearly 50 Democrats joined 242 Republicans to pass the bill , which the White House has threatened to veto . Sen. Ted Cruz , a Republican presidential candidate , suggested the U.S. only accept Christian refugees . Ben Carson , another candidate , likened refugees to `` rabid dogs '' threatening the neighborhood .
But those responses ignore one very important fact : the refugee program is quite simply the toughest way for a foreigner to legally enter the United States . There are other security gaps that would be easier for would-be terrorists to exploit .
As of now , none of the Paris attackers have been confirmed as having entered Europe as refugees .
In fact , most of the Paris attackers were European citizens born in France or Belgium . Two of them appear to have entered Europe through Greece although it does n't appear that they came in through a refugee program .
A Syrian passport found next to one of the attackers ' bodies stoked fears that the man had been a refugee . That has not yet been confirmed , although top European officials have suggested the passport was doctored , which raises its own set of questions , but does not confirm the suspected attacker was a refugee . Others have definitively been shown to be European citizens
Perhaps more importantly , the European refugee admission system is dramatically different from the U.S. system for Syrians , in large part because the U.S. is geographically separated from Syria . The U.S. has the opportunity to do far more vetting before refugees arrive on their shores .

Refugees must undergo an 18- to 24-month screening process , minimum , that the United Nations ' refugee arm oversees . And that 's before individual countries even begin to consider a refugee 's application and conduct their own additional interviews and background checks .
The screening process generally includes multiple interviews , background checks and an extensive cross-referencing process that tests refugee 's stories against others and accounts from sources on the ground in their home country .
Throughout that process , U.N. officials and local government officials in temporary host countries like Turkey , Jordan and Lebanon look to determine the legitimacy of asylum seekers ' claims and ensure that they meet the criteria of a refugee , including that they are not and have not been involved in any fighting or terrorist activities .
Refugees also have their retinas scanned and have their fingerprints lifted .

`` The very , very few Syrian refugees who are accepted and referred for consideration for resettlement in another country -- there simply is no more closely scrutinized population on earth these days , '' he added .
That 's because other countries have so far pledged to resettle just 159,000 of the more than 4 million Syrian refugees -- setting an extremely high bar for resettlement .
And refugees are n't automatically considered for resettlement : only the most vulnerable refugees -- such as torture victims , female heads of household , people with serious medical conditions and other especially vulnerable groups .
So after they go through that process by the U.N. , the U.S. does an additional screening ?
That 's right . After a rigorous screening process and several interviews carried out by the U.N. refugee agency , refugees the U.S. agrees to consider for resettlement have to undergo an additional interview , medical evaluation and security screening .
According to one U.S. government official , there 's an additional layer of vetting that 's specific to Syrian applicants , including special briefings for interviewers and information from the U.S. intelligence community .
The security screening involves checks against several government agencies ' databases and terrorist watch lists using biographic and biometric information . It 's a process Mark Toner , a State Department spokesman , recently called `` the most stringent security process for anyone entering the United States . ''
And Syrian refugees get an additional , more targeted layer of screening involving the U.S. Intelligence agency , according to a government official .
Sounds pretty rigorous . How does the refugee process stack up to other ways of getting into the U.S. ?
The refugee program is simply the toughest way for any foreigner to enter the U.S. legally .
For most people , getting a tourist visa to enter the United States is much easier , but still requires an in-person interview and involves a typical background check . The process takes anywhere from a few days to a couple months .
But there 's an even easier way to get into the U.S. if you 're a citizen of one of 38 mostly European countries , including France and Belgium .
Travelers from those countries do n't even need to first apply for a visa to get into the United States . They buy a ticket , grab their passport , and undergo the usual screening from U.S. customs officials when they land in the U.S . They are still checked against security databases before they get on the plane and upon arrival .
The fact that most of the Paris attack suspects were European citizens who would have had access to the visa waiver program is setting off some alarm bells .

Sen. Angus King , an independent from Maine who sits on the intelligence committee , said it `` would be much harder '' for a terrorist to get into the country through the refugee program than with a passport from one of the 38 countries in the visa waiver program .

`` Terrorists could exploit the program , could go from France to Syria , as 2,000 fighters have done , come back to France , use the visa waiver program and without further scrutiny come into the United States , '' said Feinstein , a senior member of the intelligence committee .

terrorism,USA TODAY,1,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/12/09/pensacola-shooting-update-nas-pensacola-being-investigated-terror/2628732001/,Why is the Pensacola shooting being investigated as a terror attack? Here's what we know now,2019-12-09,,"Authorities on Monday continued to investigate a shooting at a Florida naval base that left three people dead and eight wounded as a possible act of terrorism .
A Saudi pilot training at Pensacola 's Naval Aviation Schools Command was fatally shot by a sheriff ’ s deputy during the rampage Friday .
Second Lt. Mohammed Alshamrani , 21 , of the Royal Saudi Air Force was the sole shooter , armed with a legally purchased 9mm Glock handgun and several extra magazines , and no arrests have been made in the case , FBI special agent in charge Rachel Rojas said Sunday .
Rojas also said investigators were still trying to determine a motive for Friday 's attack .
Why is the shooting being investigated as an act of terror ?
`` We work , as we do with most active-shooter investigations , with the presumption that this was an act of terrorism , '' Rojas said at a Sunday news conference . However , she said the `` investigation has not led us to any information that indicated any credible threat to our community . ''
More on Pensacola shooting : FBI investigating Pensacola rampage as act of terrorism ; Saudi student recorded attack
Rojas said investigators were probing whether the shooter acted alone or within a network , or whether `` any possible ideology '' prompted the attack .
Florida Gov . Ron DeSantis called the shooter somebody with `` deep-seated hatred for the United States , '' who should have been vetted by both the American and Saudi militaries .
Hours before the shooting , tweets purportedly written by the suspect railed against the United States for its support of Israel and for stationing troops at bases in Saudi Arabia . Rojas declined to confirm the tweets came from the Saudi military trainee .
Authorities were tracking a trip that the shooter made to New York with three other students in the days before the attack , a person familiar with the matter said . Based on interviews with those who made the trip , the person said , there is no indication so far that the travel was linked to anything sinister .
The trip lasted about four days . “ They did touristy things , ” said the person , who is not authorized to speak publicly .
After the group returned to Florida , the person said , the shooter and others at a dinner gathering watched videos related to mass shootings .
Rojas declined to comment on the trip and the dinner party .
The Associated Press also reported one of the three students who attended the dinner later recorded video outside the building while the shooting was taking place . Two other Saudi students watched from a car , AP reported , citing a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity after being briefed by federal authorities .
The New York Times , citing a person briefed on the investigation , said the student who recorded the video later told investigators he just happened to be in the area when the shooting broke out .

Authorities on Monday continued to investigate a shooting at a Florida naval base that left three people dead and eight wounded as a possible act of terrorism.

A Saudi pilot training at Pensacola's Naval Aviation Schools Command was fatally shot by a sheriff’s deputy during the rampage Friday.

Second Lt. Mohammed Alshamrani, 21, of the Royal Saudi Air Force was the sole shooter, armed with a legally purchased 9mm Glock handgun and several extra magazines, and no arrests have been made in the case, FBI special agent in charge Rachel Rojas said Sunday.

Rojas also said investigators were still trying to determine a motive for Friday's attack.

Here's what we know about the investigation Monday:

Why is the shooting being investigated as an act of terror?

""We work, as we do with most active-shooter investigations, with the presumption that this was an act of terrorism,"" Rojas said at a Sunday news conference. However, she said the ""investigation has not led us to any information that indicated any credible threat to our community.""

Rojas said investigators were probing whether the shooter acted alone or within a network, or whether ""any possible ideology"" prompted the attack.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called the shooter somebody with ""deep-seated hatred for the United States,"" who should have been vetted by both the American and Saudi militaries.

Hours before the shooting, tweets purportedly written by the suspect railed against the United States for its support of Israel and for stationing troops at bases in Saudi Arabia. Rojas declined to confirm the tweets came from the Saudi military trainee.

Authorities were tracking a trip that the shooter made to New York with three other students in the days before the attack, a person familiar with the matter said. Based on interviews with those who made the trip, the person said, there is no indication so far that the travel was linked to anything sinister.

The trip lasted about four days. “They did touristy things,” said the person, who is not authorized to speak publicly.

After the group returned to Florida, the person said, the shooter and others at a dinner gathering watched videos related to mass shootings.

Rojas declined to comment on the trip and the dinner party.

The Associated Press also reported one of the three students who attended the dinner later recorded video outside the building while the shooting was taking place. Two other Saudi students watched from a car, AP reported, citing a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity after being briefed by federal authorities.

The New York Times, citing a person briefed on the investigation, said the student who recorded the video later told investigators he just happened to be in the area when the shooting broke out. The FBI said in a statement that it had obtained video taken by a bystander from outside the building after the attack had begun and after first responders had arrived.

How did the gunman have access to a firearm?

The pistol used in the shooting was purchased ""legally and lawfully"" in Florida through a process that was open to ""any foreign national,"" Rojas said.

""That’s a federal loophole that he took advantage of,"" said DeSantis, adding that he would urge President Donald Trump and other federal decision-makers to change policies that allow foreign nationals to arm themselves.

If they are an official of a foreign government or a distinguished foreign visitor as designated by the U.S. Department of State

If they are a foreign law enforcement officer of a friendly foreign government entering the U.S. on official law enforcement business

There is also a process where a foreign national can petition the U.S attorney general directly for a waiver that allows them to possess a gun.

It is unclear exactly what criteria allowed the Pensacola gunman to purchase a firearm, but he was a member of the Royal Saudi Air Force who was credentialed with the U.S. through an aviation training program.

However, Acting Defense Secretary Mark Esper said he had ordered a review of the Defense Department's security and vetting policies. Guns are not allowed on the base, said Navy Rear Adm. Gary Mayes, without prior approval.

Why was the gunman training in the United States?

Alshamrani was one of 852 Saudi nationals in the United States training under a cooperation agreement. He was among 5,180 foreign students from 153 countries in the United States for military training. Many of those students operate U.S. military hardware that foreign governments buy from the United States.

Training international students at Navy Air Station Pensacola is a core part of the base's mission.

The shooter began his three-year course in August 2017 with English, basic aviation and initial pilot training, said officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly because of the ongoing investigation.

Foreign military trainees are vetted before traveling to the United States. U.S. Embassy personnel research databases for activities such as support for terrorism, drug trafficking, corruption and other criminal behavior. Travel orders are denied to those who fail to pass the screening, one official said.

US-Saudi alliance:Pensacola shooting by Saudi national raises new questions

The shootings in Florida come at an already tense moment in U.S.-Saudi relations after Saudi Arabia's role in the 2018 slaying of Jamal Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and Washington Post journalist.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Saturday that he spoke with Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, ""who expressed his condolences and sadness at the loss of life in the horrific attack"" in Florida.

Who are the victims?

The Navy identified the victims as Airman Mohammed Hathaim, 19, of St. Petersburg, Florida; Ensign Joshua Kaleb Watson, 23, of Coffee, Alabama; and Airman Apprentice Cameron Scott Walters, 21, of Richmond Hill, Georgia.

Watson ""saved countless lives,"" his family said after the shooting.

“Heavily wounded, he made his way out to flag down first responders and gave an accurate description of the shooter,” his father, Benjamin Watson, said. “He died serving his country.”

He gets what makes them cheer and what turns them off . And Trump ’ s response to Friday ’ s horrific white supremacist terrorist attack in New Zealand that saw 49 Muslims murdered was coldly calculated to play to them , especially his refusal to use the term “ white supremacist terrorism . ”
But first there was to Trump ’ s reaction to the terrorist attack on Twitter where he spoke of standing , “ in solidarity with New Zealand ” and declaring , “ We love you New Zealand ! ” Great sentiment but where was the mention of Muslims , as in , “ I stand with the Muslim community today ” ? ! After all , the 49 victims were all Muslims killed in their place of worship because they were Muslim .
There ’ s no doubt Trump ’ s failure to say any kind words about Muslims was by design . Trump understands that would likely upset his base whom he has fed a diet of anti-Muslim hate , from declaring that “ Islam hates us ” to calling for a total ban on Muslims coming to this country , and his 2016 comment that takes on a different meaning after Friday ’ s terror attack : “ We 're having problems with the Muslims coming into this country…You have to deal with the mosques , whether we like it or not . ”
And then , Friday afternoon , it got worse . Responding to a question by an ABC reporter about whether he believed there was a growing threat of white nationalism worldwide , Trump responded , “ I don ’ t really , ” adding , “ I think it ’ s a small group of people that have very , very serious problems. ” Our own ears and eyes ( as well as statistics ) tells us that ’ s a lie . Again , this reaction is because Trump gets his base better than anyone .
Of course , this is the same Trump who hammered Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign for not saying the phrase , “ radical Islamic Terrorism. ” As Trump declared then , “ Now , to solve a problem , you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name . She won ’ t say the name . ”
But repeating time and time again “ radical Islamic terrorism ” plays great with Trump ’ s base . After all 65 percent of 2016 GOP primary voters supported banning all Muslims from entering America . In contrast , if Trump slammed white supremacists , that would not excite them .
I made that very point in my May 2017 article , months before Charlottesville , after two deadly attacks by self-professed white supremacists , one in Portland and the other in New York City . In fact , after the New York City attack by a self-avowed 28-year-old white supremacist who murdered a black man in the hopes of starting a race war , the murderer was even charged with terrorism by the Manhattan District Attorney .
But still Trump refused to use the phrase “ white supremacist terrorism. ” While Trump remained silent , white supremacists , however , did not . In response to that article , Trump-supporting white supremacists at the Neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website were so outraged that I would demand this of Trump , they fabricated tweets in my name claiming I was involved in the Manchester , England bombing that had occurred a few weeks before at an Ariana Grande concert . And then they urged their supporters to “ confront ” me , which they did in a barrage of death threats . ( I sued the New Nazi website in a lawsuit in federal court that is still pending . )
And just three months later came Charlottesville , where MAGA hats littered the crowd as did white supremacists who in the past had praised Trump , such as former Klan Grand Wizard David Duke . And after yet another white supremacist terrorist attack on Trump ’ s watch , with the murder of Heather Heyer at that rally , Trump blamed “ both sides ” while still refusing to say the words , “ white supremacist terrorism . ”
“ The gunman in New Zealand hailed Trump in his manifesto as ' a symbol of renewed white identity . ' ”
At this point , Trump lies somewhere between an apologist for white supremacist terrorism and a person who inspires people to commit such acts . While ultimately those who commit the violent acts are responsible for their crimes , we can ’ t ignore the connection between people who support Trump and white supremacist violence . For example , the gunman in New Zealand hailed Trump in his manifesto as “ a symbol of renewed white identity . ”
And we have just recently seen two other groups of self-avowed white supremacist Trump supporters either be arrested to or sentenced to prison for plotting to kill Muslims in America , in attacks that would ’ ve looked like what we just saw in New Zealand . In January , four young white man were arrested plotting to kill Muslims in Islamberg , New York , a primarily African-American Muslim community about two hours north of New York City . One of the men arrested not only praised Trump but also white-supremacist images like Confederate statues while speaking of killing Muslims on social media , including children : “ Kids have been shown to be terrorists too and have killed our people . The Koran tells them to kill us so they ’ re all GUILTY . ”
Also in January , three other self-avowed Trump-supporting white supremacists who had plotted to kill Muslim refugees from Somalia living in Kansas were sentenced to 25 years in prison . These men were trying to “ wake people up ” to threat of Muslim immigration and one even quoted Trump ’ s own debunked tale of a U.S. general dipping bullets into pig blood before killing Muslims , while stating , “ If you ’ re a Muslim I ’ m going to enjoy shooting you in the head . ”
Yet still Trump won ’ t say the words “ white supremacist terrorism. ” And he never will because Trump ’ s number one concern is winning in 2020 . Trump is simply following his 2016 campaign playbook that took him to the White House which included retweeting white supremacists and refusing to denounce David Duke when first asked to do so on national TV . And that should scare all Americans who oppose white supremacy .","Donald Trump understands his base better than anyone. He gets what makes them cheer and what turns them off.

In fact, after the New York City attack by a self-avowed 28-year-old white supremacist who murdered a black man in the hopes of starting a race war, the murderer was even charged with terrorism by the Manhattan District Attorney.

But still Trump refused to use the phrase “white supremacist terrorism.” While Trump remained silent, white supremacists, however, did not. In response to that article, Trump-supporting white supremacists at the Neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website were so outraged that I would demand this of Trump, they fabricated tweets in my name claiming I was involved in the Manchester, England bombing that had occurred a few weeks before at an Ariana Grande concert. And then they urged their supporters to “confront” me, which they did in a barrage of death threats. (I sued the New Nazi website in a lawsuit in federal court that is still pending.)

And just three months later came Charlottesville, where MAGA hats littered the crowd as did white supremacists who in the past had praised Trump, such as former Klan Grand Wizard David Duke. And after yet another white supremacist terrorist attack on Trump’s watch, with the murder of Heather Heyer at that rally, Trump blamed “both sides” while still refusing to say the words, “white supremacist terrorism.”

“ The gunman in New Zealand hailed Trump in his manifesto as 'a symbol of renewed white identity.' ”

At this point, Trump lies somewhere between an apologist for white supremacist terrorism and a person who inspires people to commit such acts. While ultimately those who commit the violent acts are responsible for their crimes, we can’t ignore the connection between people who support Trump and white supremacist violence. For example, the gunman in New Zealand hailed Trump in his manifesto as “a symbol of renewed white identity.”

And we have just recently seen two other groups of self-avowed white supremacist Trump supporters either be arrested to or sentenced to prison for plotting to kill Muslims in America, in attacks that would’ve looked like what we just saw in New Zealand. In January, four young white man were arrested plotting to kill Muslims in Islamberg, New York, a primarily African-American Muslim community about two hours north of New York City. One of the men arrested not only praised Trump but also white-supremacist images like Confederate statues while speaking of killing Muslims on social media, including children: “Kids have been shown to be terrorists too and have killed our people. The Koran tells them to kill us so they’re all GUILTY.”

Also in January, three other self-avowed Trump-supporting white supremacists who had plotted to kill Muslim refugees from Somalia living in Kansas were sentenced to 25 years in prison. These men were trying to “wake people up” to threat of Muslim immigration and one even quoted Trump’s own debunked tale of a U.S. general dipping bullets into pig blood before killing Muslims, while stating, “If you’re a Muslim I’m going to enjoy shooting you in the head.”

Yet still Trump won’t say the words “white supremacist terrorism.” And he never will because Trump’s number one concern is winning in 2020. Trump is simply following his 2016 campaign playbook that took him to the White House which included retweeting white supremacists and refusing to denounce David Duke when first asked to do so on national TV. And that should scare all Americans who oppose white supremacy.",www.thedailybeast.com,left,1QhjRKfD1xWnIrdZ

A nationwide manhunt for the suspects of France 's deadliest terrorist attack in more than 50 years ended in a hail of gunfire on Friday .
After hours of tension in two separate standoffs that shut down parts of the Paris metro area , the two main suspects in the attack on a satirical magazine and a man who took hostages at a kosher grocery are dead , President François Hollande said in a speech to the nation .
Hollande also said four hostages had been killed today ; he called the week 's events `` a tragedy for the nation , an obligation for us to confront terrorists . ''
`` We are a free nation that does not give in , '' the French president said . `` We carry an ideal that is greater than us . ''
The standoffs started this morning , when police cornered Said and Chérif Kouachi , who were suspected of killing 12 people in the Charlie Hebdo attack , at a print shop in the small town of Dammartin-en-Goele .
While initial reports said an employee of the shop was being held hostage there , it later emerged that the worker , reportedly a graphic designer , was hiding in the building , undetected by the gunmen .
`` He was able to give [ by text messages ] tactical elements '' such as the positions inside the building , French TV news Itele reports .
Separately , in eastern Paris , a gunman identified as Amedy Coulibaly entered a kosher grocery and took several people hostage . He also called a TV news station , seeking to talk to police ( more on that in our updates below ) . And it seems that amidst his phone calls , Coulibaly did n't hang up properly — allowing police to hear his movements .
`` The audio information was n't distinct , '' BFM TV reports , `` but was precious to law enforcement . ''
The station adds that police began their assault on the store at the same time they heard Coulibaly start praying .
Police have made several connections between Coulibaly and the Kouachi brothers , French media report , through cellphone and legal records . Police are still looking for one suspect : Hayat Boumeddiene , 26 , whom they say was involved in the killing of a policewoman in Paris Thursday .
`` U.S. officials say both Coulibaly and Boumeddiene were known to American intelligence authorities , '' NPR 's Dina Temple-Raston reports .
A little after 11 a.m . ET , and as the sun began to set in France , explosions were heard at both the store and the print shop , as police began an assault .
Images on French television showed hostages streaming out of the kosher grocery store after an explosion and gunfire ; a large explosion was seen at the print shop in Dammartin-en-Goele . That was followed by smoke billowing from the building .
The AFP reported that when police stormed the print shop , the Kouachi brothers came out firing and were killed during the confrontation . The authorities say Coulibaly was killed during the siege of the kosher market .
NPR 's Eleanor Beardsley reports that police were first tipped off to the Kouachi brothers when a resident reported a stolen car in the small village of Dammartin-en-Goele , 25 miles northeast of Paris . The caller recognized the brothers and told police that they were heavily armed .
Police moved in and surrounded the print shop , located in an industrial center not far from the Charles de Gaulle airport outside Paris . For hours , special tactical units kept watch , while helicopters swooped overhead .
As that was unfolding , another gunman walked into the kosher shop in eastern Paris , reportedly taking a handful of hostages .
Eleanor reported that the series of events left the city — already reeling from its worst terrorist attack in more than 50 years — in a state of shock . Police cordoned off parts of Paris , and officers in tactical gear and with big guns walked through the streets as sirens sounded everywhere .
Police also released a poster naming Coulibaly and a 26-year-old woman named Hayat Boumeddiene as suspects in a shooting that left a policewoman dead on Thursday . There is still no word on the whereabouts of Boumeddiene .
By around 11:30 a.m . ET , the siege was over . In total , since the mass shooting at Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday , 17 people have been killed in France .
Hours after the standoffs ended , Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula released a statement threatening France with more violence ; the AP says that the group has claimed responsibility for Wednesday 's attack .
Hollande said the country knows that the threat is not `` yet over . ''
He called for vigilance and extra security ; he said the country should reject any racist attacks like the `` anti-Semitic act '' committed today . He also said that the suspects killed today `` have nothing to do with Islam . ''
`` We must show our determination against anything that may divide us , '' Hollande said .

Paris prosecutor Francois Molins has confirmed more details about the case . Molins spoke late Friday ; here 's a quick recap of what he said :
Four people who died in a kosher grocery were killed when Coulibaly first entered the store , not at the end of the standoff .
One of the Kouachi brothers was wounded in the neck during an earlier shootout with police .
Weapons seized include an M82 rocket launcher and multiple Kalashnikov machine guns . Reuters says Coulibaly 's weapons included a `` Skorpion military pistol . ''
16 people have been taken into police custody since Wednesday 's attack ; 5 remain in custody .
Update at 5:50 p.m . ET : Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula Reportedly Claims Responsibility
A senior official of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula praised this week 's attack in Paris and threatened France with more violence , according to the SITE organization , which monitors extremist groups .
A speech by was posted online Friday , after the chief suspects in the attack were killed . In it , Sheikh Harith al-Nadhari says ( according to SITE 's translation ) :
`` Some of the sons of France were disrespectful to the prophets of Allah , so a group from among the believing soldiers of Allah marched unto them , then they taught them respect and the limit of the freedom of expression . ''
The AQAP separately claimed responsibility for guiding the attack , the AP says .
Update at 5 p.m . ET : Suspects Said To Have Spoken To French Media Before Deadly Showdown
A French media outlet says it spoke to both Chérif Kouachi and Amedy Coulibaly as the men were engaged in two separate standoffs with police , and that both of them avowed ties to terrorist groups .
The phone interviews with Kouachi and Coulibaly reportedly took place well before France 's BFM TV or its sister radio station RMC broadcast them .
BFM TV says the conversation with Kouachi took place after a journalist called the print shop where the Kouachi brothers were holed up .
Kouachi said he and his brother had not killed any civilians and that they had acted to avenge Prophet Muhammad . He also said that Western forces had killed women and children in Iraq , Afghanistan , and Syria .
According to a synopsis by Sarah-Lou Cohen , the head of BFMTV 's police and justice unit , Kouachi said he had been supported by Al-Qaeda in Yemen — a group now more commonly known as Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula .
When asked about the possibility that he might be killed , Kouachi answered , `` That 's not a problem . ''
BFM TV says it spoke to Coulibaly after he called the network asking for a number for the police . At the time of the conversation , the man said that four people had already died in the kosher grocery where he had barricaded himself from the authorities .
Coulibaly claimed allegiance to the extremist group that calls itself the Islamic State ( or ISIS ) ; he also said that his actions were tied to those of the Kouachi brothers .
When asked if the attacks had been synchronized , he answered , `` No . Just when they started the attack at Hebdo , I was to attack police . ''
Speaking in front of students at Pellisippi State Community College in Tennessee , President Obama offered the French his support .
`` The United States stands with you today , stands with you tomorrow , '' Obama said .
The president added that the U.S. stood by the values that the U.S. and France share .
`` In the streets of Paris , the world 's seen once again what terrorists stand for : they have nothing to offer but hatred and human suffering , '' Obama said . `` And we stand for freedom and hope and the dignity of all human beings . And that 's what the city of Paris represents to the world . ''
Closing his speech to a round of applause , Obama said , `` And that spirit will endure forever – long after the scourge of terrorism is banished from this world .
Update at 1:21 p.m . ET . 'How Great The Threat Is ' :
In statements to the press , France 's Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve thanked the police officers and the special teams that worked to end the crisis today .
He said the events of the past few days `` show how great the threat '' is to France .
`` It is incumbent on us to be on constantly alert , '' Cazeneuve said .
The minister refused to give any details of the operation , because he said he did not want to put out any misinformation .
President François Hollande will address his country at 2 p.m . ET , according to Palais de l'Élysée .
According to multiple media outlets , both hostage standoffs in France are over .
According to reports , Said and Chérif Kouachi were killed in the siege in Dammartin-en-Goele , and Amedy Coulibaly was killed in the siege in eastern Paris .
Minutes apart , reporters at both standoff locations reported gunshots and explosions .
NPR 's Lauren Frayer reported that French television showed what appeared to be civilians streaming out of the kosher grocery store in eastern Paris .
Television images showed a large explosion at a print shop in Dammartin-en-Goele . That was followed by smoke billowing from the building .
NPR 's Eleanor Beardsley says she has just heard loud explosions and gunfire in Paris .
The booms , she told Morning Edition , were followed by sirens .
NPR 's Eleanor Beardsley reports that police have cordoned off a big area of eastern Paris . She reports that `` everyone is in a state of shock . ''
`` People are angry and nervous , '' she told our Newscast unit . `` It 's a crazy scene . ''
You can hear sirens and police dressed in tactical gear with big guns walking the city .
Television images are showing light smoke coming from the printing company where the Kouachi brothers are thought to be holed up .
Police forces in tactical gear were also on the roof of the building .
Reuters reports one of its reporters heard gunshots and `` several explosions . ''
There 's a lot going on in this story . Here , we 'll try to lay out all of the known connections plainly :
-- There are four events to keep in mind . 1 . The shooting at Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday morning . 2 . The shooting death of a female police officer on Thursday in Montrouge . 3 . An ongoing standoff in Dammartin-en-Goele , where police believe the two main suspects in the Charlie Hebdo shooting , Said and Chérif Kouachi , are holed up in the building of a printing company . 4 . An ongoing standoff at a kosher shop in eastern Paris , where , according to multiple media reports , police believe Amedy Coulibaly has taken a handful of hostages .
-- Earlier today , police named Coulibaly as a suspect in the shooting death of the female police officer on Thursday .
-- NPR 's Dina Temple-Raston reported on Morning Edition that U.S. officials have been telling her privately that Thursday 's shooting incident was terrorism related .
-- Dina says that authorities now believe that Coulibaly is a friend of the Kouachi brothers .
-- Le Parisen reports that in 2010 , Coulibaly was implicated in trying to help in the escape of one of the masterminds of terrorist attacks that happened in 1995 . The news outlet also reports that Coulibaly was convicted on terrorism charges .
-- As we reported , Chérif Kouachi was implicated in that same incident in 2010 .
Numerous news organizations have reported that police sources tell them that a shooting that left one police officer dead on Thursday is linked to the shootings at the offices of Charlie Hebdo .
France 24 reports that the people suspected of committing that crime belong to the same organizations as the Kouachi brothers .
Police have officially released a photograph of two suspects in that shooting in Montrouge . In that flier , police say the two — Hayat Boumeddiene , 26 , and Amedy Coulibaly , 32 — are wanted in a murder committed in connection with a `` terrorist organization . ''
Update at 8:09 a.m . ET . Interior Minister At Scene Of Kosher Shop :
France 's Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve is at the scene of an apparent hostage situation in eastern Paris .
Television images have shown dozens of police officers in tactical gear in front of the kosher shop .
`` Paris prosecutor : Gunman with hostages in kosher market in eastern Paris ; police SWAT on scene . ''
It 's worth noting that it 's not clear whether all of these events are related .
In case you have not been paying attention , here 's a quick summary of what 's been happening in France :
Wednesday morning , at least two gunmen entered the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo , a satirical magazine that has in the past been threatened by Islamic extremists , and opened fire , killing 12 people , including four of the magazine 's founding cartoonists .
Police launched a massive manhunt for two suspects : Said and Chérif Kouachi , French citizens whom authorities had been watching for some time . Chérif was convicted on terrorism charges in 2008 . He served 18 months for helping to funnel fighters from France to Iraq .
Today , that manhunt seems to have come to a climax , because police believe the two men are cornered at a printing company 's building in a city northeast of Paris .
Multiple news outlets , including AFP , France 24 and Le Monde , are reporting that an armed man has entered a kosher shop in eastern Paris and may have taken a hostage .
There is no word on whether this incident , which police have not confirmed , might be related to the attack on Charlie Hebdo .
Update at 7:16 a.m . ET . Not Certain If There Are Hostages :
On Twitter , an Interior Ministry spokesman said the men now in a standoff with police are `` certain to be the Kouachi brothers . '' The spokesman said it was still not clear whether the two suspects had taken any hostages .
`` The priority is to establish a dialogue with the suspects , '' the spokesman added .
He added that there had been no deaths or injuries at the time and that police had not launched an assault on the building .
Citing an unnamed French official , the AP says police have `` made contact with terror suspects . ''","Suspects In Paris Magazine Attack Killed; Market Gunman And 4 Hostages Also Dead

Images on French television showed hostages streaming out of the kosher grocery store after an explosion and gunfire; a large explosion was seen at the print shop in Dammartin-en-Goele. That was followed by smoke billowing from the building.

The AFP reported that when police stormed the print shop, the Kouachi brothers came out firing and were killed during the confrontation. The authorities say Coulibaly was killed during the siege of the kosher market.

NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports that police were first tipped off to the Kouachi brothers when a resident reported a stolen car in the small village of Dammartin-en-Goele, 25 miles northeast of Paris. The caller recognized the brothers and told police that they were heavily armed.

Police moved in and surrounded the print shop, located in an industrial center not far from the Charles de Gaulle airport outside Paris. For hours, special tactical units kept watch, while helicopters swooped overhead.

As that was unfolding, another gunman walked into the kosher shop in eastern Paris, reportedly taking a handful of hostages.

Eleanor reported that the series of events left the city — already reeling from its worst terrorist attack in more than 50 years — in a state of shock. Police cordoned off parts of Paris, and officers in tactical gear and with big guns walked through the streets as sirens sounded everywhere.

Police also released a poster naming Coulibaly and a 26-year-old woman named Hayat Boumeddiene as suspects in a shooting that left a policewoman dead on Thursday. There is still no word on the whereabouts of Boumeddiene.

By around 11:30 a.m. ET, the siege was over. In total, since the mass shooting at Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday, 17 people have been killed in France.

Hours after the standoffs ended, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula released a statement threatening France with more violence; the AP says that the group has claimed responsibility for Wednesday's attack.

Hollande said the country knows that the threat is not ""yet over.""

He called for vigilance and extra security; he said the country should reject any racist attacks like the ""anti-Semitic act"" committed today. He also said that the suspects killed today ""have nothing to do with Islam.""

""We must show our determination against anything that may divide us,"" Hollande said.

Update at 6:50 p.m. ET: Explosives In Kosher Grocery

Paris prosecutor Francois Molins has confirmed more details about the case. Molins spoke late Friday; here's a quick recap of what he said:

Four people who died in a kosher grocery were killed when Coulibaly first entered the store, not at the end of the standoff.

Coulibaly had explosive devices, but they were not detonated.

One of the Kouachi brothers was wounded in the neck during an earlier shootout with police.

Weapons seized include an M82 rocket launcher and multiple Kalashnikov machine guns. Reuters says Coulibaly's weapons included a ""Skorpion military pistol.""

16 people have been taken into police custody since Wednesday's attack; 5 remain in custody.

Update at 5:50 p.m. ET: Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula Reportedly Claims Responsibility

A senior official of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula praised this week's attack in Paris and threatened France with more violence, according to the SITE organization, which monitors extremist groups.

A speech by was posted online Friday, after the chief suspects in the attack were killed. In it, Sheikh Harith al-Nadhari says (according to SITE's translation):

""Some of the sons of France were disrespectful to the prophets of Allah, so a group from among the believing soldiers of Allah marched unto them, then they taught them respect and the limit of the freedom of expression.""

The AQAP separately claimed responsibility for guiding the attack, the AP says.

Update at 5 p.m. ET: Suspects Said To Have Spoken To French Media Before Deadly Showdown

A French media outlet says it spoke to both Chérif Kouachi and Amedy Coulibaly as the men were engaged in two separate standoffs with police, and that both of them avowed ties to terrorist groups.

The phone interviews with Kouachi and Coulibaly reportedly took place well before France's BFM TV or its sister radio station RMC broadcast them.

BFM TV says the conversation with Kouachi took place after a journalist called the print shop where the Kouachi brothers were holed up.

Kouachi said he and his brother had not killed any civilians and that they had acted to avenge Prophet Muhammad. He also said that Western forces had killed women and children in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria.

According to a synopsis by Sarah-Lou Cohen, the head of BFMTV's police and justice unit, Kouachi said he had been supported by Al-Qaeda in Yemen — a group now more commonly known as Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.

When asked about the possibility that he might be killed, Kouachi answered, ""That's not a problem.""

BFM TV says it spoke to Coulibaly after he called the network asking for a number for the police. At the time of the conversation, the man said that four people had already died in the kosher grocery where he had barricaded himself from the authorities.

Coulibaly claimed allegiance to the extremist group that calls itself the Islamic State (or ISIS); he also said that his actions were tied to those of the Kouachi brothers.

When asked if the attacks had been synchronized, he answered, ""No. Just when they started the attack at Hebdo, I was to attack police.""

Update at 2:16 p.m. ET. 'We Stand For Freedom':

Speaking in front of students at Pellisippi State Community College in Tennessee, President Obama offered the French his support.

""The United States stands with you today, stands with you tomorrow,"" Obama said.

The president added that the U.S. stood by the values that the U.S. and France share.

""In the streets of Paris, the world's seen once again what terrorists stand for: they have nothing to offer but hatred and human suffering,"" Obama said. ""And we stand for freedom and hope and the dignity of all human beings. And that's what the city of Paris represents to the world.""

Closing his speech to a round of applause, Obama said, ""And that spirit will endure forever – long after the scourge of terrorism is banished from this world.

Update at 1:21 p.m. ET. 'How Great The Threat Is':

In statements to the press, France's Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve thanked the police officers and the special teams that worked to end the crisis today.

He said the events of the past few days ""show how great the threat"" is to France.

""It is incumbent on us to be on constantly alert,"" Cazeneuve said.

The minister refused to give any details of the operation, because he said he did not want to put out any misinformation.

Update at 12:11 p.m. ET. Hollande To Address Nation:

President François Hollande will address his country at 2 p.m. ET, according to Palais de l'Élysée.

Update at 12:01 p.m. ET. Siege Is Over:

According to reports, Said and Chérif Kouachi were killed in the siege in Dammartin-en-Goele, and Amedy Coulibaly was killed in the siege in eastern Paris.

There is still no word on any other casualties.

Update 11:19 a.m. ET. Explosions, Gunfire At Both Locations:

Minutes apart, reporters at both standoff locations reported gunshots and explosions.

NPR's Lauren Frayer reported that French television showed what appeared to be civilians streaming out of the kosher grocery store in eastern Paris.

Television images showed a large explosion at a print shop in Dammartin-en-Goele. That was followed by smoke billowing from the building.

Update at 11:14 a.m. ET. Explosions, Sirens:

NPR's Eleanor Beardsley says she has just heard loud explosions and gunfire in Paris.

She says people started running when they heard it.

The booms, she told Morning Edition, were followed by sirens.

It's still unclear what is going on.

Update 11:06 a.m. ET. The Scene In Paris:

NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports that police have cordoned off a big area of eastern Paris. She reports that ""everyone is in a state of shock.""

""People are angry and nervous,"" she told our Newscast unit. ""It's a crazy scene.""

You can hear sirens and police dressed in tactical gear with big guns walking the city.

Update at 11 a.m. ET. Smoke, Explosions:

Television images are showing light smoke coming from the printing company where the Kouachi brothers are thought to be holed up.

Police forces in tactical gear were also on the roof of the building.

Reuters reports one of its reporters heard gunshots and ""several explosions.""

Update at 10:08 a.m. ET. The Links:

There's a lot going on in this story. Here, we'll try to lay out all of the known connections plainly:

-- There are four events to keep in mind. 1. The shooting at Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday morning. 2. The shooting death of a female police officer on Thursday in Montrouge. 3. An ongoing standoff in Dammartin-en-Goele, where police believe the two main suspects in the Charlie Hebdo shooting, Said and Chérif Kouachi, are holed up in the building of a printing company. 4. An ongoing standoff at a kosher shop in eastern Paris, where, according to multiple media reports, police believe Amedy Coulibaly has taken a handful of hostages.

-- Earlier today, police named Coulibaly as a suspect in the shooting death of the female police officer on Thursday.

-- NPR's Dina Temple-Raston reported on Morning Edition that U.S. officials have been telling her privately that Thursday's shooting incident was terrorism related.

-- Dina says that authorities now believe that Coulibaly is a friend of the Kouachi brothers.

-- Le Parisen reports that in 2010, Coulibaly was implicated in trying to help in the escape of one of the masterminds of terrorist attacks that happened in 1995. The news outlet also reports that Coulibaly was convicted on terrorism charges.

-- As we reported, Chérif Kouachi was implicated in that same incident in 2010.

Update at 8:22 a.m. ET. A Link Between Shootings:

Numerous news organizations have reported that police sources tell them that a shooting that left one police officer dead on Thursday is linked to the shootings at the offices of Charlie Hebdo.

France 24 reports that the people suspected of committing that crime belong to the same organizations as the Kouachi brothers.

Police have officially released a photograph of two suspects in that shooting in Montrouge. In that flier, police say the two — Hayat Boumeddiene, 26, and Amedy Coulibaly, 32 — are wanted in a murder committed in connection with a ""terrorist organization.""

Update at 8:09 a.m. ET. Interior Minister At Scene Of Kosher Shop:

France's Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve is at the scene of an apparent hostage situation in eastern Paris.

Television images have shown dozens of police officers in tactical gear in front of the kosher shop.

The AP moved this alert:

""Paris prosecutor: Gunman with hostages in kosher market in eastern Paris; police SWAT on scene.""

It's worth noting that it's not clear whether all of these events are related.

Update at 7:52 a.m. ET. Background:

In case you have not been paying attention, here's a quick summary of what's been happening in France:

Wednesday morning, at least two gunmen entered the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo, a satirical magazine that has in the past been threatened by Islamic extremists, and opened fire, killing 12 people, including four of the magazine's founding cartoonists.

Police launched a massive manhunt for two suspects: Said and Chérif Kouachi, French citizens whom authorities had been watching for some time. Chérif was convicted on terrorism charges in 2008. He served 18 months for helping to funnel fighters from France to Iraq.

Today, that manhunt seems to have come to a climax, because police believe the two men are cornered at a printing company's building in a city northeast of Paris.

Update at 7:49 a.m. ET. Another Incident In Paris:

Multiple news outlets, including AFP, France 24 and Le Monde, are reporting that an armed man has entered a kosher shop in eastern Paris and may have taken a hostage.

There is no word on whether this incident, which police have not confirmed, might be related to the attack on Charlie Hebdo.

Update at 7:16 a.m. ET. Not Certain If There Are Hostages:

On Twitter, an Interior Ministry spokesman said the men now in a standoff with police are ""certain to be the Kouachi brothers."" The spokesman said it was still not clear whether the two suspects had taken any hostages.

""The priority is to establish a dialogue with the suspects,"" the spokesman added.

He added that there had been no deaths or injuries at the time and that police had not launched an assault on the building.

Update at 6:51 a.m. ET. Police Make Contact:

Citing an unnamed French official, the AP says police have ""made contact with terror suspects.""",www.npr.org,center,WzQsLhHjbpDn5Cp4

At least 80 people were killed and 231 injured Saturday when suicide bombers attacked a large demonstration in the Afghan capital of Kabul, according to the Afghan Interior Ministry.

The demonstration was organized by ethnic Hazaras demanding that a major regional power line be rerouted through their impoverished home province. Most Hazaras are Shiite Muslims but most Afghans are Sunni.

With the capture Friday night of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , the 19-year-old surviving suspect in the bombings at the Boston Marathon , the story moves into a new phase — one of trying to answer critical questions .
Authorities hope to get many answers from Tsarnaev himself . As NPR 's Dina Temple-Raston said on All Things Considered , with the death earlier Friday of the suspect 's 26-year-old brother and alleged accomplice , Tamerlan Tsarnaev , investigators hope Dzhokhar will tell them `` if there are other people involved [ and ] if perhaps there are other bombs elsewhere .

As NPR 's Carrie Johnson reported Friday night , a Department of Justice official tells her that Tsarnaev will not be read his Miranda rights for now . `` We plan to invoke the public safety exception to Miranda in order to question the suspect extensively about other potential explosive devices or accomplices and to gain critical intelligence , '' the official said .

'' The Tsarnaev family 's ethnic roots trace back to Chechnya . ''
Late Friday , the FBI released a statement that says , in part :
`` The FBI reviewed its records and determined that in early 2011 , a foreign government asked the FBI for information about Tamerlan Tsarnaev . The request stated that it was based on information that he was a follower of radical Islam and a strong believer , and that he had changed drastically since 2010 as he prepared to leave the United States for travel to the country 's region to join unspecified underground groups . `` In response to this 2011 request , the FBI checked U.S. government databases and other information to look for such things as derogatory telephone communications , possible use of online sites associated with the promotion of radical activity , associations with other persons of interest , travel history and plans , and education history . The FBI also interviewed Tamerlan Tsarnaev and family members . The FBI did not find any terrorism activity , domestic or foreign , and those results were provided to the foreign government in the summer of 2011 . The FBI requested but did not receive more specific or additional information from the foreign government . ''

With the capture Friday night of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the 19-year-old surviving suspect in the bombings at the Boston Marathon, the story moves into a new phase — one of trying to answer critical questions.

The Sox' David Ortiz also won applause with his remarks, as he told the audience, ""This is our (expletive) city, and nobody is going to dictate our freedom. Stay strong.""

Update at 2:20 p.m. ET. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's Injuries, And Possible Charges:

When he was apprehended in a residential area, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was suffering from gunshot wounds to his neck and leg, says CBS correspondent John Miller, who reports that ""this is a guy who was very weak at this point and probably — had he not been discovered — he might not have lived."" The suspect remains in serious condition, as of the latest FBI update.

If he survives, Tsarnaev may face state murder charges as well as federal terrorism charges, CNN reports, citing a Justice Department source.

Update at 10:50 a.m. ET. Work At Crime Scenes May Be Slowed By Weather:

One of her law enforcement sources tells NPR's Carrie Johnson that investigators have much work to do today at the various crime scenes in Watertown, Cambridge and Boston. They also caution that the work may be slowed by weather in the area. There's rain in today's forecast.

Update at 9:40 a.m. ET. FBI's 2011 Interview Of Tamerlan Tsarnaev Likely To Raise Questions:

There was word Friday night, as we reported, that in 2011 the FBI interviewed Tamerlan Tsarnaev at the request of an unidentified foreign government. As NPR's Corey Flintoff reports on Weekend Edition Saturday, that ""could well have been Russia, which has reason to fear terrorist attacks after a long history of turmoil in the North Caucasus."" The Tsarnaev family's ethnic roots trace back to Chechnya.""

Late Friday, the FBI released a statement that says, in part:

""The FBI reviewed its records and determined that in early 2011, a foreign government asked the FBI for information about Tamerlan Tsarnaev. The request stated that it was based on information that he was a follower of radical Islam and a strong believer, and that he had changed drastically since 2010 as he prepared to leave the United States for travel to the country's region to join unspecified underground groups. ""In response to this 2011 request, the FBI checked U.S. government databases and other information to look for such things as derogatory telephone communications, possible use of online sites associated with the promotion of radical activity, associations with other persons of interest, travel history and plans, and education history. The FBI also interviewed Tamerlan Tsarnaev and family members. The FBI did not find any terrorism activity, domestic or foreign, and those results were provided to the foreign government in the summer of 2011. The FBI requested but did not receive more specific or additional information from the foreign government.""

Time magazine's Swampland blog predicts that the FBI's handling of that 2011 request for information and subsequent interview of Tamerlan Tsarnaev will raise many questions from members of Congress.

Update at 9:05 a.m. ET. Homeowner's Step Outside Led To Discovery Of Flapping Tarp, Pool Of Blood And The Fugitive:

The Watertown homeowner who tipped police off that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev might be hiding in a boat had stepped outside for a breath of fresh air Friday evening after authorities said it was OK for residents to leave their homes, the man's stepson told CNN's Piers Morgan.

Robert Duffy told CNN that his stepfather, David Henneberry, noticed something odd. The tarp over the boat stored in his backyard was flapping in the wind. It was the same tarp that had held firm through several blizzards over the winter.

""He got closer and realized that one of the retention straps had literally been cut — not chafed, not broken or unhooked,"" Duffy told CNN. And Henneberry then saw blood on the tarp. He got up on a stepladder to look inside. ""He basically stuck his head under the tarp [and] noticed a pool of blood,"" Duffy said.

Moments later, according to Duffy, Henneberry was calling 911. Police were quickly on the scene. Within just a couple of hours, after a brief gunbattle and the arrival of a police negotiator, Tsarnaev was in custody.

Update at 8:45 a.m. ET. More On The ""Public Safety Exemption"":

NBC News writes: ""The exemption can be invoked when information is needed to protect public safety. In this instance, the government believes it's vital to find out if Tsarnaev planted any other explosives before his capture or whether others might have plotted with him to do so.""

Update at 8:20 a.m. ET. Also Hoping To Get Answers From Tamerlan Tsarnaev's Wife:

On Weekend Edition Saturday, NPR's Tom Gjelten said authorities are also hoping that the wife of Tamerlan Tsarnaev will help answer critical questions.

The day's early headlines:

-- ""Dzhokar Tsarnaev ... In Serious Condition"" At Heavily Guarded Boston-Area Hospital."" (CNN)

-- ""Watertown Resident, Who Lifted Boat's Bloody Tarp, Led To Capture."" (WBUR)

-- ""Photos Force Suspects' Move, Breaking Bombing Case."" (Boston Herald)

-- ""Boston Bombing Suspects Wanted To Fit In, Friends Say."" (Reuters)

-- ""Life In America Unraveled For Brothers."" (The Wall Street Journal)

Note: As happens when stories such as this are developing, there will likely be reports that turn out to be mistaken. Wednesday, for example, there were reports from CNN, the AP, WBUR and others that authorities either had arrested a suspect or were about to do that. It turned out that no one had been arrested or taken into custody. We will focus on news being reported by NPR, other news outlets with expertise, and statements from authorities who are in a position to know what's going on. And if some of that information turns out to be wrong, we'll update.

On Saturday , the Somali group released a video threatening Westgate-style attacks on targets in Britain , Canada , and the United States . In the 2013 Westgate attack , several gunmen stormed the mall and fired indiscriminately at shoppers , killing more than 60 people and wounding scores more . The masked jihadi in the new video called for more such attacks , asking , `` Can you imagine what a dedicated mujahideen in the West could do to the American and Jewish-owned shopping centers across the world ? ”

US Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said on Sunday that `` Anytime a terrorist organization calls for an attack on a specific place , we 've got to take that seriously .

Hillary Clinton offers a detailed account of the deadly attack on the American embassy in Benghazi — and a pointed rebuttal to Republican critics who’ve laced into her over the incident — in a much-anticipated chapter of her forthcoming book, “Hard Choices,” obtained by POLITICO.

“Those who exploit this tragedy over and over as a political tool minimize the sacrifice of those who served our country,” Clinton writes in the gripping chapter, “Benghazi: Under Attack.”

Story Continued Below

Casting doubt on the motivations of congressional Republicans who have continued to investigate the attacks, including with an upcoming House select committee, Clinton continues: “I will not be a part of a political slugfest on the backs of dead Americans. It’s just plain wrong, and it’s unworthy of our great country. Those who insist on politicizing the tragedy will have to do so without me.”

( Also on POLITICO: Clinton allies mobilize on Benghazi)

The 34-page chapter is Clinton’s most complete account to date of the attack and its aftermath. Her tone is less defensive than defiant: Clinton takes responsibility for the “horror” of the loss of life in Benghazi, but puts it in the context of “the heartbreaking human stakes of every decision we make” — and she accuses adversaries of manipulating a tragedy for partisan gain.

There has been, she writes, a “regrettable amount of misinformation, speculation, and flat-out deceit by some in politics and the media,” but new information from “a number of reputable sources continues to expand our understanding of these events.”

The chapter appears intended, in part, to give Democrats a clear framework to respond to Republicans who have raised questions about Clinton’s role and what the Obama administration has said about the Sept. 11, 2012, killing of four Americans. The section was obtained and reviewed by POLITICO on the eve of a meeting in which members of Democratic-leaning groups will be briefed by Clinton’s team about how she addresses the attacks in the book.

And in a sign of the concerted effort to rebut the ongoing controversy in a cohesive way, Clinton’s camp has brought on former National Security Council spokesman and longtime President Barack Obama hand Tommy Vietor to assist in the response to the book, a source familiar with the plan said.

The book’s arrival comes as Clinton is considering a second presidential campaign in 2016. Pieces that have emerged ahead of the June 10 release include a section about Clinton’s late mother, the author’s note and a four-minute video featuring the former first lady talking about the book. On Thursday, conservative-leaning Fox News — which has heavily covered the Benghazi story — announced Clinton will sit down with two of its anchors for an interview during her book rollout media blitz.

Asked to comment on what Clinton hoped to achieve with the Benghazi chapter, among the most anticipated sections of her State Department retrospective, her spokesman, Nick Merrill, responded, “Until the book is released, there’s nothing to say. And once it’s released, it will speak for itself.”

The chapter is a mostly chronological retrospective of the attack interspersed with Clinton’s views. She points out that she ordered an investigation into what happened nine days after the attacks, and that she agreed with and implemented all 29 of the recommendations made by a review board.

While saying that as a former senator she respects the “oversight role that Congress is meant to play,” Clinton later adds, “Many of these same people are a broken record about unanswered questions. But there is a difference between unanswered questions and unlistened to answers.”

Clinton defends the intelligence at the time preceding the attack on the American compound in Benghazi. An anti-Islamic video that had sparked a protest at an embassy in Cairo was proved in “later investigation and reporting,” including by The New York Times, to have been “indeed a factor” in what happened in Benghazi, Clinton writes.

That point is among those that has been debated during hearings into the attacks.

“There were scores of attackers that night, almost certainly with differing motives,” she writes. “It is inaccurate to state that every single one of them was influenced by this hateful video. It is equally inaccurate to state that none of them were. Both assertions defy not only the evidence but logic as well.”

Clinton addresses lingering questions about how military assets were deployed to try to rescue personnel at the besieged compound, writing that Obama “gave the order to do whatever was necessary to support our people in Libya. It was imperative that all possible resources be mobilized immediately. … When Americans are under fire, that is not an order the Commander in Chief has to give twice. Our military does everything humanly possible to save American lives — and would do more if they could. That anyone has ever suggested otherwise is something I will never understand.”

Memphis is where the call-and-response songs of the cotton fields and the gospel hymns of the local black churches fused with the blues of the Southern chitlin’ circuit and the twang of country honky-tonks in the bars and music clubs of Beale Street, creating a powerful concoction that changed American music forever.

Police captured Rahami after a shootout Monday in New Jersey, ending the hunt for the man wanted for a New Jersey explosion and a bombing in New York that left 29 people injured

Sources say they believe Rahami is linked to an explosives-laden backpack found in Elizabeth, New Jersey -- a city where Rahami had lived.

While authorities believe they have their main suspect, they're still trying to figure out a motive -- and whether Rahami had help.

Here's what we know about the suspect:

His background and education

This image apparently taken from surveillance footage shows Rahami, officials say.

-- Rahami was born in Afghanistan in 1988 and first came to the United States in 1995, several years after his father arrived seeking asylum, a law enforcement official said.

-- He became a naturalized citizen in 2011.

-- Rahami majored in criminal justice at Middlesex County College in Edison, New Jersey, school spokesman Tom Peterson said. Rahami attended from 2010-2012 but did not graduate.

His wife

His travels to Afghanistan and Pakistan

-- Rahami traveled to Afghanistan multiple times , according to law enforcement sources. He was questioned every time he returned to the United States, as is standard procedure, but was not on the radar as someone who might have been radicalized, one official said.

-- Rahami spent several weeks in Kandahar, Afghanistan, and Quetta, Pakistan, in 2011, according to a law enforcement official who reviewed his travel and immigration record. Quetta is considered a stronghold of the Taliban. He married his wife during that trip.

-- Upon his return to the United States, Rahami had to go through secondary screening because he visited an area of Pakistan known for its Taliban presence, according to the official. At that time, he told immigration officials he was visiting family and attending his uncle's wedding and renewing his Pakistani visa.

-- Two years later, in April 2013, Rahami went to Pakistan and stayed there until March 2014, the official said. His brother Mohammad traveled to Pakistan about the same time.

-- During that time, the official said, Ahmad Rahami also traveled by car to Afghanistan as well. When he returned to the United States, he was once again taken into secondary questioning and told officials he was visiting his wife, his uncles and his aunts.

The official said each time he was taken to secondary screening, he satisfied whatever concerns immigration officials had.

-- Investigators are looking into whether Rahami was radicalized overseas before returning to the United States in 2014, the official said.

terrorism,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/may/10/when-politics-override-accountability/,AUSBROOK: When politics override accountability,2013-05-10,J. Keith Ausbrook,"When the U.S. government fails to protect its citizens , we must determine why . Such failures can erode public faith in the government ’ s abilities and diminish public trust in its leaders . President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Supreme Court Justice Owen Roberts to examine the attacks on Pearl Harbor . The 9/11 Commission reviewed the attacks on the United States on Sept. 11 , 2001 . Congress produced two reports on Hurricane Katrina , and the White House produced a lessons-learned report . These reports reflect a healthy self-examination , and their public nature is intended to restore trust and promote improvement .
With respect to the Benghazi attacks , the State Department ’ s Accountability Review Board report to then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and ongoing congressional investigations looking into the Benghazi attack provide important insights into the government ’ s failures . The staggering number and scope of the findings and recommendations suggests more than an isolated security breakdown . They suggest a collapse of policy , operations and decision-making . Such a collapse , in stark contradiction to election-year claims , could explain why State Department and White House officials felt the need to falsify talking points and deceive the American people about events in Benghazi .
Now that it is beyond doubt that Susan Rice ’ s talking points were not only inaccurate but falsified , the most important remaining question is why ? What were the talking points trying to cover up ? Could it really be that senior leadership in the State Department was worried about being criticized by Congress ? State Department emails suggest as much , but only insofar as the agency ignored warnings about these attacks . Still , Congress criticizes agencies all the time . Indeed , congressional oversight , by its nature , casts a critical eye on agency activity .
The failure to heed threat warnings — warnings that emails acknowledge were known to “ senior officials ” at least in the days immediately after the attack — could have been an embarrassing management mistake , or worse , much worse . It could have been the direct result of a failure to appreciate the strategic threat from al Qaeda and its affiliates — in this case , al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb — and to align and coordinate our intelligence , military and diplomatic resources to meet this strategic threat . During the election season , that could have been perceived as a serious political problem , not just routine criticism .
Even more troubling , testimony at Wednesday ’ s hearing before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee suggests that this was not a failure of policy , but this was policy . Deputy Chief of Mission Gregory H. Hicks told a rapt audience that military personnel available to be sent from Tripoli to Benghazi were not authorized to join the fight . State Department counterterrorism official Mark Thompson testified that the State Department ( without ever consulting him ) did not advocate to the Deputies Committee sending a Foreign Emergency Support Team that both he and the FBI thought could have been made available and had an impact .
While the Accountability Review Board recommendations are presented largely as management reforms , it seems as much an admonition to remember the obvious point that projecting American influence abroad must include the use of force to defend our missions . Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton wrote in her board transmittal letter to Congress that “ the decimation of al Qaeda ’ s central leadership in Afghanistan and Pakistan has led to growing ambitions among the terror network ’ s far-flung affiliates , including [ al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb ] . These are not new concerns . They have been a top priority of our national security team . ”
If this was a top priority , it certainly did not look like it . This one board review revealed that the administration needed to make significant improvements to meet this threat . Along with 29 recommendations from the board , here is just a sample of new actions initiated by the State Department :
Requesting that Department of Defense deploy personnel to serve on five Interagency Security Assessment Teams for high-threat posts .
Taking a “ harder look ” at the capabilities of host countries .
Partnering with the Pentagon to dispatch hundreds of Marine security guards to bolster post security .
Realigning resources in the 2013 budget request to address physical vulnerabilities .
Strengthening mutual security arrangements between the State Department and other government agencies in places where they are not co-located .
Like the responses to other government reports and recommendations for remedial action following a crisis , these actions will go some distance toward aligning our assets with our mission . That should address concerns over the government ’ s ability to protect us . How about public trust ? The election is over . The question is whether , by falsifying the talking points to cover this up during the campaign season , these remedial steps alone can restore the trust government needs to be successful .
J. Keith Ausbrook served as chief counsel for the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , special counsel to a House select committee on Hurricane Katrina , and as executive secretary for the Homeland Security Council in the administration of President George W. Bush .","ANALYSIS/OPINION:

Congress produced two reports on Hurricane Katrina, and the White House produced a lessons-learned report. These reports reflect a healthy self-examination, and their public nature is intended to restore trust and promote improvement.

With respect to the Benghazi attacks, the State Department’s Accountability Review Board report to then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and ongoing congressional investigations looking into the Benghazi attack provide important insights into the government’s failures. The staggering number and scope of the findings and recommendations suggests more than an isolated security breakdown. They suggest a collapse of policy, operations and decision-making. Such a collapse, in stark contradiction to election-year claims, could explain why State Department and White House officials felt the need to falsify talking points and deceive the American people about events in Benghazi.

Now that it is beyond doubt that Susan Rice’s talking points were not only inaccurate but falsified, the most important remaining question is why? What were the talking points trying to cover up? Could it really be that senior leadership in the State Department was worried about being criticized by Congress? State Department emails suggest as much, but only insofar as the agency ignored warnings about these attacks. Still, Congress criticizes agencies all the time. Indeed, congressional oversight, by its nature, casts a critical eye on agency activity.

The failure to heed threat warnings — warnings that emails acknowledge were known to “senior officials” at least in the days immediately after the attack — could have been an embarrassing management mistake, or worse, much worse. It could have been the direct result of a failure to appreciate the strategic threat from al Qaeda and its affiliates — in this case, al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb — and to align and coordinate our intelligence, military and diplomatic resources to meet this strategic threat. During the election season, that could have been perceived as a serious political problem, not just routine criticism.

Even more troubling, testimony at Wednesday’s hearing before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee suggests that this was not a failure of policy, but this was policy. Deputy Chief of Mission Gregory H. Hicks told a rapt audience that military personnel available to be sent from Tripoli to Benghazi were not authorized to join the fight. State Department counterterrorism official Mark Thompson testified that the State Department (without ever consulting him) did not advocate to the Deputies Committee sending a Foreign Emergency Support Team that both he and the FBI thought could have been made available and had an impact.

While the Accountability Review Board recommendations are presented largely as management reforms, it seems as much an admonition to remember the obvious point that projecting American influence abroad must include the use of force to defend our missions. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton wrote in her board transmittal letter to Congress that “the decimation of al Qaeda’s central leadership in Afghanistan and Pakistan has led to growing ambitions among the terror network’s far-flung affiliates, including [al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb]. These are not new concerns. They have been a top priority of our national security team.”

If this was a top priority, it certainly did not look like it. This one board review revealed that the administration needed to make significant improvements to meet this threat. Along with 29 recommendations from the board, here is just a sample of new actions initiated by the State Department:

Requesting that Department of Defense deploy personnel to serve on five Interagency Security Assessment Teams for high-threat posts.

Taking a “harder look” at the capabilities of host countries.

Partnering with the Pentagon to dispatch hundreds of Marine security guards to bolster post security.

Realigning resources in the 2013 budget request to address physical vulnerabilities.

Hiring additional diplomatic security personnel.

Strengthening mutual security arrangements between the State Department and other government agencies in places where they are not co-located.

Like the responses to other government reports and recommendations for remedial action following a crisis, these actions will go some distance toward aligning our assets with our mission. That should address concerns over the government’s ability to protect us. How about public trust? The election is over. The question is whether, by falsifying the talking points to cover this up during the campaign season, these remedial steps alone can restore the trust government needs to be successful.

J. Keith Ausbrook served as chief counsel for the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, special counsel to a House select committee on Hurricane Katrina, and as executive secretary for the Homeland Security Council in the administration of President George W. Bush.

A headline in London exclaims that what happened in Paris “has galvanized France.” Well, that’s good, so far as it goes. Galvanized can be a good thing only if the galvanizee stays galvanized. The record is not encouraging.

September 11 galvanized the world, a date that, like December 7, would live in infamy. In the wake of September 11 a leading newspaper in Paris proclaimed that “we are all Americans now.” President George W. Bush, standing in the ruins of the World Trade Center, with wisps of smoke and ash curling at his feet, promised to avenge the blood and bone of the 3,000 Americans who perished on a day with a harvest of dead to rival that at Antietam or Pearl Harbor.

We know how all that turned out, galvanized or not. Within a matter of weeks the naysayers were picking apart the resolve that united the nation, and the spirit of September 11 turned out to be not even a ghost of December 7. The infamy remained, the infamy of short memories, impatience and wilting resolve.

This is not your grandfather’s country, where resolve thrived, multiplied and prospered, as we’re reminded a hundred times a day. Resolve is like ice cream, delicious and satisfying in the moment, but it melts quickly. Some of the most heroic galvanized words fall from the tongue of the British and French prime ministers, and theirs are the countries most overrun with the waves of immigrants with no taste for the melting pot that once could transform an immigrant from Pakistan or Syria into an Englishman or a Frenchman, or at least a fairly reasonable facsimile thereof. No longer. Whole neighborhoods in London and Paris have become places where “outsiders,” including police, no longer dare go. Cities are soon divided by tribe and caste.

America is led by a president who neither understands nor celebrates the America that elected him. He knows only that his election, and re-election, gave him an opportunity to get on with transforming America into a nation that your grandfather would not recognize.

The president’s remarkable snub of the solidarity march in Paris cannot surprise anyone who has been paying attention to the news. This president cannot bring himself to confront the threat to America and call it by its rightful name.

This indifference to reality is followed closely by the plotters of the evil of the Islamic State, or ISIS or ISIL or whatever they’re calling evil this week. The thrill of marching in Paris will wear off, and then what? Will the West go back to the comfort of indolence and the luxury of indifference?

ISIS is betting that it will. We can be sure that the excitement of murder, massacre and mayhem like that in Paris will not wear off for the radicals, but will move to other places, including the United States. We will all be shocked and enraged, and someone will organize a march, or a rally, and we will be galvanized once more.

The massacres at Charlie Hebdo and the kosher supermarket in Paris and the reaction of the civilized world have accomplished one good thing, if it can be maintained and built on. The reaction has startled the world of Islam, and the worthy parts of that religion. Certain Muslims are overcoming their own fear of Islamic retribution and are speaking out, saying the things they should have said years ago, that evil men cannot be allowed to impose rule by barbarism.

They’re stung by assertions in the West that there’s something inherent in Islam that inspires many Muslims to see murder and mayhem as the way to plant their religion in the places where persuasion won’t work. Many saddened Muslims say they are examining the empathy they felt in the past toward killers, that “even if they’re wrong, they’re still fellow Muslims.”

But now, Hasan Askari Rizvi, an independent political analyst in Pakistan, tells The Associated Press, “I hear more people talking openly against extremism and militancy.”

There’s a lot that the West does not understand about a “faith” that does not require actual belief, but can be imposed by gun and scimitar. In the West, faith, like love, is felt in the heart. Something imposed by force, under threat of violence and death, is not something generally recognized as faith in the West.

A reformation of Islam, to weed out the false and the bad, will be a long-term project. The West can take heart, and wish the reformers well. But it cannot ignore the threat of the radicals, as certain leaders in the West are so eager to do. Otherwise, we’re galvanized to remember a whole calendar of dates in infamy.

Adler, Ilya Somin, Eugene Volokh, C.J. Ciaramella, Zuri Davis, Peter Suderman, Matt Welch","Donald Trump predictably blames `` our extremely open immigration system '' for Saturday 's bomb attacks in New Jersey and New York City . His critique overlooks the details of this particular case as well as the general rarity of terrorism by immigrants .
Ahmad Khan Rahami , the 28-year-old man police arrested on Monday in connection with the bombings , is a naturalized U.S. citizen who immigrated to the United States from Afghanistan at the age of 7 . He seems to have been radicalized within the last few years , a period when he spent nearly a year in Pakistan and became noticeably more religious and taciturn .
It is hard to imagine how the `` extreme vetting '' Trump advocates for immigrants from `` any nation that has been compromised by terrorism '' could have kept Rahami out of the country . What questions could have been posed to his parents that would have predicted his violent turn two decades later ?
Trump faults his Democratic opponent , Hillary Clinton , for supporting the admission of Syrian refugees , who he says pose an unacceptable risk of terrorism . But according to a recent study by Cato Institute immigration policy analyst Alex Nowrasteh , `` the chance of an American being murdered in a terrorist attack caused by a refugee is 1 in 3.64 billion per year . ''
Trump has recommended `` a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country 's representatives can figure out what is going on '' —a plan that his own running mate called `` offensive and unconstitutional . '' More recently Trump has said the moratorium should apply to all visitors from countries `` compromised by terrorism , '' a category that arguably includes most of the world .
Some pundits favor a cleaner approach . `` Confronted with the threat of Islamic terrorism , '' Nowrasteh notes , `` well-known conservatives like Larry Kudlow , David Bossie , and Ann Coulter have called for a complete moratorium on immigration . ''
A broad moratorium would have the advantage of preventing all terrorist attacks by newly admitted immigrants . But it would also exclude more than 1 million innocent people each year it was in effect , at a huge economic cost . Nowrasteh cites estimates ranging from $ 35 billion to $ 229 billion a year .
Nowrasteh reports that tourists accounted for 94 percent of deaths caused by foreign-born terrorists in the United States from 1975 through 2015 . Including tourists in the moratorium would raise the annual cost by another $ 194 billion or so .
Given the rarity of deaths caused by terrorism , Nowrasteh shows , such costs can not possibly be justified . Based on a value of $ 15 million per life , he puts `` the combined human , property , business , and economic costs '' of attacks by foreign-born terrorists during the 41-year period covered by his study at $ 5.3 billion annually , which is `` far less than the minimum estimated yearly benefit of $ 229.1 billion from immigration and tourism . ''
Even that calculation overestimates the potential security benefit of cutting off immigration , since it is dominated by the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , an anomalous event that is unlikely to be replicated . The 9/11 attacks ( which were perpetrated not by naturalized citizens or by refugees but by visitors with tourist or student visas ) account for 99 percent of the 3,024 deaths caused by foreign-born terrorists from 1975 through 2015 .
Excluding 9/11 , the overwhelming majority of terrorist murders in the United States—more than 90 percent—have been committed by native-born Americans . Except for 2001 , the risk of being killed by a foreign-born terrorist has been minuscule and flat for more than four decades .
That risk is extremely low even if you include 9/11 : about 1 in 3.6 million per year . You are more than 200 times as likely to die in a traffic accident , 20 times as likely to be killed by falling down stairs , and four times as likely to drown in a bathtub .
Any politician who wants to impose large costs in response to such a tiny risk has a lot of explaining to do .","Donald Trump predictably blames ""our extremely open immigration system"" for Saturday's bomb attacks in New Jersey and New York City.

That risk is extremely low even if you include 9/11: about 1 in 3.6 million per year. You are more than 200 times as likely to die in a traffic accident, 20 times as likely to be killed by falling down stairs, and four times as likely to drown in a bathtub.

Any politician who wants to impose large costs in response to such a tiny risk has a lot of explaining to do.

WASHINGTON — FBI Director James Comey told a Senate panel Wednesday that the killers responsible for last week's California massacre were individually radicalized before they ever met online and discussed jihad more than two years before the deadly assault that left 14 dead and 21 wounded.

Comey's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee offers the fullest timeline yet for the radicalization of Sayed Farook and wife Tashfeen Malik and appears to undercut an earlier theory that the Pakistani-born Malik may have converted her husband to an extremist ideology, leading to the assault. Comey said Malik appears to have discussed jihad and martyrdom before she was granted a so-called fiancée visa in 2014 to enter the USA, where she later married Farook.

Those early communications, Comey said, indicate the shooters were ""at least in part'' inspired by the Islamic State terror group, also known as ISIL or ISIS. Because the earliest discussions of jihad in 2013 appeared to come before the Islamic State's emergence as a global threat, Comey said investigators were reviewing other sources of similar radical thought that may have inspired the couple.

Asked by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., whether the marriage of the two with similar extremist interests may have been arranged to allow the couple to develop an attack in the USA, Comey said investigators do not know.

""It would be a very important thing to know,'' he said.

He said there was no reason to believe that ""cells'' of operatives linked to the Islamic State were embedded in the USA, planning to strike. Largely based on the arsenal of ammunition and bomb components found in a search of the couple's Redlands, Calif., home, Comey said authorities continued to try to determine whether they had identified other possible targets.

ET on Friday . See this note about how we cover news such as this . For our running post about developments on Saturday , go here . )
After a massive manhunt that locked down most of the Boston metropolitan area , police apprehended Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , whom the FBI had identified as suspect 2 in the deadly bombings at the Boston Marathon . The Boston Police Department made the announcement in a twitter message late Friday night .
Dzhokhar was found hiding in a boat in the back of a house in Watertown , Massachusetts . A homeowner , who walked to his backyard , shortly after police called off the lockdown , saw blood on his boat . He picked up the canvas cover and saw the suspect lying there .
Police surrounded the house at around 7:30 p.m . ET . Using thermal sensors , helicopters picked up his movement and after more than an hour of the hostage rescue team trying to communicate with him unsuccesfully , they moved in and he was apprehended .
Key Developments : — After a massive manhunt that locked down most of the Boston metropolitan area , police apprehended Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , whom the FBI had identified as suspect 2 in the deadly bombings at the Boston Marathon . — His older brother , Tamerlan , was killed in a gun exchange early Friday . — The two are ethnic Chechnyans , though relatives say they lived much of their lives in Kyrgyzstan and the U.S. — They are also suspected in the shooting death of an MIT university police officer .
Residents of Watertown took the street en-masse . Television images showed them cheering on emergency workers and chanting `` USA ! USA ! USA ! ''
WBUR 's Fred Thys reports the `` 19-year-old suspect was bloodied when taken into custody . '' NPR 's Richard Knox reports that he was taken to Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital .
Tamerlan Tsarnaev , Dzhokhar 's older brother , whom the FBI identified as suspect 1 in the bombings , was killed in a gun exchange early Friday with police in Watertown , Mass .
The two suspects , authorities initially told NPR and other news outlets , were brothers from Chechnya . Later Friday , relatives said that while the family is originally from Chechnya , the brothers lived there only briefly . The family lived for many years in Kyrgyzstan , before coming to the U.S. in the past decade .
Mass transit service in the Boston area was suspended Friday morning . So was taxi service for the first few hours of the day . Drivers were being told to stay off the streets in Watertown . Businesses there were told not to open . Boston city officials asked residents to `` please go home '' and not congregate at bus stops or other places . Just after 8 a.m . ET , officials said the `` shelter in place '' advisory had been extended to the entire city of Boston .
The dramatic series of events began to unfold late Thursday , with what turned out to be an unrelated robbery at a convenience store in Cambridge , Mass. , and the shooting death of a police officer on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Minutes later , officials say , an SUV was carjacked in Cambridge .
That SUV was driven to Watertown . There , authorities say , the suspects threw explosives at police and exchanged gunfire . One of the two — known as `` black hat '' for the cap he was seen wearing at the marathon — was critically injured and later died . The other , `` white hat , '' whom the FBI says was seen in security video dropping off a backpack near the second explosion , fled the area and led authorities in a massive manhunt that culminated late at night .
`` CAPTURED ! ! ! The hunt is over . The search is done . The terror is over . And justice has won . Suspect in custody , '' Boston Police Department tweeted . They added : `` In our time of rejoicing , let us not forget the families of Martin Richard , Lingzi Lu , Krystle Campbell and Officer Sean Collier . ''
We 're following the story and updating as news comes in . There 's a timeline of the manhunt posted here ; a story about the Boston lockdown is here ; a profile of the suspects is here , and NPR 's coverage of the bombings and the search for the suspects is collected here .
The family of 8-year-old Martin Richard , who was killed in the attack , just sent out a statement . It read in part :
`` None of this will bring our beloved Martin back , or reverse the injuries these men inflicted on our family and nearly two hundred others . We continue to pray for healing and for comfort on the long road that lies ahead for every victim and their loved ones . `` Tonight , our family applauds the entire law enforcement community for a job well done , and trust that our justice system will now do its job . ''
A Department of Justice official tells NPR 's Carrie Johnson that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will not be read his Miranda rights for now .
`` We plan to invoke the public safety exception to Miranda in order to question the suspect extensively about other potential explosive devices or accomplices and to gain critical intelligence , '' the official said .
`` We owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to all our outstanding law enforcement officials , '' President Obama said this evening .
Obama then went on to remember the MIT officer killed during the course of the manhunt and went on to mention the three people who were killed during the bombings .
`` Tonight there are still many unanswered questions , '' Obama said . Among them , he said , why would a young person , who grew up in the United States `` resort to such violence . '' Also : `` How did they plan '' this and `` did they have any help . ''
`` The families of the victims deserve answers , '' Obama said . `` The wounded deserve answers . ''
Obama also took on the greater issues . He said whatever the bombers were trying to accomplish `` they 've already failed . ''
`` They failed because we will not waiver from the character and the compassion and the values that define us as a country , '' Obama said .
The president reminded the country that as the investigation and judicial process continue , Americans need to `` stay true '' to the unity and diversity that `` makes us strong as a country . ''
Boston Police Commissioner Edward F. Davis says police were called to a residence in Watertown after a home owner came outside and saw blood on his boat . He picked up the tarp and saw a man covered in blood .
Police rushed to the scene , setting up a perimeter . Police and the suspect exchanged gun fire and the `` hostage rescue team made entry into the boat . ''
The suspect , said Davis , was alive . The hostage rescue team tried to communicate with him before moving in , but he did not respond .
`` The man who found him at the boat said he was covered in blood , '' Davis said . `` We assume the injuries occurred the night before . ''
Col. Timothy P. Alben , superintendent of the Massachusetts State Police , said the suspect was in `` serious condition . ''
`` We 're exhausted but we have a victory here tonight , '' Col. Timothy P. Alben , superintendent of the Massachusetts State Police said during a televised news briefing .
Mass . Gov . Deval Patrick echoed those sentiments , saying that tonight is one `` where we 're all going to rest easier . ''
President Obama is also scheduled to speak after this press conference is over .
An FBI source tells Dina Temple-Raston that a negotiator was key in helping convince Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to give himself up . She tells us :
`` Source says it 's unclear whether the suspect was wearing a suicide vest or had some other type of booby trap . `` We expect more details about the operation later tonight . ''
Boston Police tweeted that authorities would hold a 9:30 p.m . ET . press conference .
Update at 9:19 p.m . ET . People Head To The Street :
After a day in which authorities asked most of Boston to stay indoors , crowds of people have rushed into the street , after word came that the fugitive suspect in the Boston Marathon bombing had been captured .
Television images show people milling around on the streets , cheering every time a law enforcement vehicle drove by .
`` Suspect in custody . Officers sweeping the area . Stand by for further info .
Talking to All Things Considered , Keith Glavish , who lives about five houses away from where police believe Dzhokhar is located , says he can hear a helicopter overhead and has occasionally heard `` shots '' that `` sound like firecrackers . ''
`` The whole scene is totally surreal , '' Glavish said . `` I mean , this is a very , very quiet neighborhood . ... I pinch myself to realize that this is actually unfolding , literally outside our door . We 've been inside all day long , cooped up , and thinking , 'Well , it 's on the other side of Watertown , we do n't really have to worry . ' I took the dog in the backyard a few times . But this is unbelievable . ''
Meanwhile The Boston Globe tweets that one of its photographers can hear police talking to a person they believe is the suspect .
`` We know you 're in there , '' the Globe reports police are saying . `` Come out on your own terms . Come out with your hands up . ''
Update at 7:41 p.m . ET . FBI Had Previous Contact With Suspect :
As we wait for more information about what 's happening at a boat in Watertown , we have more news on the investigation : NPR 's Dina Temple-Raston reports that an FBI source tells her that `` the agency interviewed the older brother Tamerlan in 2011 at the request of a foreign government . ''
At the end of the investigation , they did n't `` find anything that was enough to allow them to hold onto him . ''
Tamerlan 's mother told Russia Today , a news organization funded by the Russian government , that her children had been followed by the FBI `` for years . '' RT reports :
`` Her biggest suspicion surrounding the case was the constant FBI surveillance she said her family was subjected to over the years . She is surprised that having been so stringent with the entire family , the FBI had no idea the sons were supposedly planning a terrorist act . ''
Update at 7:31 p.m . ET . Police Believe They 've Located Suspect :
An FBI source tells NPR 's Dina Temple-Raston that police have located the suspect .
`` Officers are proceeding with caution as an official fears the suspect may have booby-trapped the scene . `` FBI is waiting for a tactical team and bomb technician . `` FBI is behaving as if the suspect is still alive . ''
`` Marathon bombings suspect believed to be inside boat in back yard of Watertown home . The boat was surrounded by police . ''
President Obama spoke to Russian President Vladamir Putin today . Putin , the White House said , expressed his condolences on behalf of the Russian people .
`` President Obama thanked President Putin for those sentiments , and praised the close cooperation that the United States has received from Russia on counter-terrorism , including in the wake of the Boston attack , '' the White House said in a statement . `` The two leaders agreed to continue our cooperation on counter-terrorism and security issues going forward . ''
Update at 7:05 p.m . ET . Residents Asked To Shelter In Place :
Multiple news organizations are reporting major police activity in Watertown . Boston Police Department tweeted :
`` Police operations in the Franklin Street Watertown area . Residents shelter in place . ''
Col. Timothy Alben asked Dzhokhar to `` stop any further violence toward anyone , '' and turn himself in .
Alben said Dzhokhar escaped on foot , because police did not have enough police to create a perimeter . But Alben said he believes the fugitive is still in Massachusetts .
Update at 6:09 p.m . ET . Stay-Indoors Order Lifted ; No Apprehension :
During a news briefing in Watertown , Massachusetts , a short time ago , authorities said the `` stay-indoors request '' has been lifted , but that no suspect has been arrested .
Gov . Deval Patrick said that while people should feel free to go about their business , they should `` remain vigilant '' because `` there is still a very dangerous person out there . ''
Col. Timothy Alben said police went up and down 20 streets , `` door to door '' conducting `` limited searches . '' Police followed many leads , but none of them have been fruitful .
`` We do not have apprehension ... but we will have one , '' said Alben .
We 've already given you a timeline of events . But it 's worth recapping . Here is a revised one via the Massachusetts State Police :
`` 2224 MIT Police get calls for what sounds like shots `` 2228 Armed Robbery of 7-11 750 Mass Ave ( not bombers ) `` 2229 MIT Officer found shot , request for ALS from Cambridge `` 2231 Call comes in for car-jacking that took place at 816 Memorial Drive `` Some time later : MBTA police spots car and pursuit ends in Watertown ''
A Massachusetts State Police spokesman Dave Procopio says police have recovered `` numerous pieces of evidence '' in Watertown , including `` homemade explosives ... pipe bombs and another pressure cooker , as well as more than 200 spent rounds . ''
Update at 5:09 p.m . ET . Suspects Did Not Rob Convenience Store :
WBUR quotes a Massachusetts State Police spokesperson saying the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing case did not rob a convenience store last night .
`` The bombers did purchase gas at a gas station in Cambridge later in the chain of events and we recovered images of them there , '' State Police spokesperson Dave Procopio told WBUR .
We 're also awaiting a news conference , scheduled for 5:30 p.m . ET .
NBC News spoke to John Curran , who coached Tamerlan when he was a boxer . It is yet another person completely stunned that Tamerlan would be suspected in the Boston Marathon bombings .
Tamerlan was `` athletic , outgoing , nice guy , very respectful , just the opposite of what you paint as a terrorist , '' Curan told NBC News .
Update at 4:07 p.m . ET . 'Most Popular Kid In High School ' :
WBUR spoke to Adhi Moro who was friends with both brothers . He gave a little more detail on Tamerlan , the older brother who was killed this morning .
Girls loved Dzhokhar in school , but he was n't too interested
It 's less surprising that Tamerlan is accused of these crimes
Their family used to rent a house in Cambridge from a nice older lady
Tamerlan seems to have been a big influence on Dzhokhar
Update at 3:29 p.m . ET . Red Sox , Bruins Postpone Games :
The Red Sox and Bruins have cancelled their games in Boston tonight .
The Sox tweeted they were postponing their game to `` support efforts of law enforcement officers . ''
A classmate of Dzhokhar tells NPR 's Andy Carvin that the twitter account @ J_Tsar was indeed his . Another classmate tells Buzzfeed the same thing .
Here 's what that account tells us , according to NPR 's Social Media desk :
-- He has been active since the bombing , last tweet on Wednesday -- He tweeted `` aint no love in the heart of the city , stay safe people '' on the day of the bombing -- He tweets about Chechnya and being proud to be from there -- He tweeted lots of music lyrics - Eminem , Peter Frampton , Michael Jackson , Paul McCartney -- He may have been a 9/11 truther , based on tweets
Dzhokhar also appeared to have an Amazon Wish List . Among the items on it , books on how to forge driver 's licenses and books about Chechen history .
Radio Liberty , an overseas news service funded by the United States , spoke to Anzor Tsarnaeov , whom they and the AP identified as the suspects ' father .
According to an English translation by Sergei Sotnikov , a producer at NPR 's Moscow bureau , the father said he could not imagine his sons doing such a thing .
`` Knowing our children — you see we know our children — if a person did n't pray how he can go and blow up or something ... I do n't know . I have never seen either explosives ... nothing , '' Tsarnaeov said . Later in the interview he said this was a `` setup . ''
This is very much in line with what the suspects ' aunt , Maret Tsarnaev , told NPR 's Joe Shapiro .
`` This totally does n't make sense to me , '' she said , adding that authorities had not released definitive proof that these were the people responsible for the Boston blasts .
`` Tamerlan and Dzhokhar never were extremists , '' Tsarnaeve said . `` Never had enemies . Never had any — of course everybody has opinion on every issue . But does mean that you live with it , and you would go for a heinous ugly act ? Like happened on that marathon street in Boston . And again , all I can see these two boys are walking on the street . ''

On Vkontakte — described as the Russian equivalent of Facebook — he lists his personal priority as `` Career and money , '' and his world view as `` Islam . ''

After a massive manhunt that locked down most of the Boston metropolitan area, police apprehended Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, whom the FBI had identified as suspect 2 in the deadly bombings at the Boston Marathon. The Boston Police Department made the announcement in a twitter message late Friday night.

Dzhokhar was found hiding in a boat in the back of a house in Watertown, Massachusetts. A homeowner, who walked to his backyard, shortly after police called off the lockdown, saw blood on his boat. He picked up the canvas cover and saw the suspect lying there.

Police surrounded the house at around 7:30 p.m. ET. Using thermal sensors, helicopters picked up his movement and after more than an hour of the hostage rescue team trying to communicate with him unsuccesfully, they moved in and he was apprehended.

Key Developments: — After a massive manhunt that locked down most of the Boston metropolitan area, police apprehended Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, whom the FBI had identified as suspect 2 in the deadly bombings at the Boston Marathon. — His older brother, Tamerlan, was killed in a gun exchange early Friday. — The two are ethnic Chechnyans, though relatives say they lived much of their lives in Kyrgyzstan and the U.S. — They are also suspected in the shooting death of an MIT university police officer.

Residents of Watertown took the street en-masse. Television images showed them cheering on emergency workers and chanting ""USA! USA! USA!""

WBUR's Fred Thys reports the ""19-year-old suspect was bloodied when taken into custody."" NPR's Richard Knox reports that he was taken to Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev, Dzhokhar's older brother, whom the FBI identified as suspect 1 in the bombings, was killed in a gun exchange early Friday with police in Watertown, Mass.

The two suspects, authorities initially told NPR and other news outlets, were brothers from Chechnya. Later Friday, relatives said that while the family is originally from Chechnya, the brothers lived there only briefly. The family lived for many years in Kyrgyzstan, before coming to the U.S. in the past decade.

Mass transit service in the Boston area was suspended Friday morning. So was taxi service for the first few hours of the day. Drivers were being told to stay off the streets in Watertown. Businesses there were told not to open. Boston city officials asked residents to ""please go home"" and not congregate at bus stops or other places. Just after 8 a.m. ET, officials said the ""shelter in place"" advisory had been extended to the entire city of Boston.

The dramatic series of events began to unfold late Thursday, with what turned out to be an unrelated robbery at a convenience store in Cambridge, Mass., and the shooting death of a police officer on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Minutes later, officials say, an SUV was carjacked in Cambridge.

That SUV was driven to Watertown. There, authorities say, the suspects threw explosives at police and exchanged gunfire. One of the two — known as ""black hat"" for the cap he was seen wearing at the marathon — was critically injured and later died. The other, ""white hat,"" whom the FBI says was seen in security video dropping off a backpack near the second explosion, fled the area and led authorities in a massive manhunt that culminated late at night.

""CAPTURED!!! The hunt is over. The search is done. The terror is over. And justice has won. Suspect in custody,"" Boston Police Department tweeted. They added: ""In our time of rejoicing, let us not forget the families of Martin Richard, Lingzi Lu, Krystle Campbell and Officer Sean Collier.""

Update at 10:43 p.m. ET. No Miranda:

""The families of the victims deserve answers,"" Obama said. ""The wounded deserve answers.""

Obama also took on the greater issues. He said whatever the bombers were trying to accomplish ""they've already failed.""

""They failed because we will not waiver from the character and the compassion and the values that define us as a country,"" Obama said.

The president reminded the country that as the investigation and judicial process continue, Americans need to ""stay true"" to the unity and diversity that ""makes us strong as a country.""

Update at 9:54 p.m. ET. Suspect In Serious Condition:

Boston Police Commissioner Edward F. Davis says police were called to a residence in Watertown after a home owner came outside and saw blood on his boat. He picked up the tarp and saw a man covered in blood.

Police rushed to the scene, setting up a perimeter. Police and the suspect exchanged gun fire and the ""hostage rescue team made entry into the boat.""

The suspect, said Davis, was alive. The hostage rescue team tried to communicate with him before moving in, but he did not respond.

""The man who found him at the boat said he was covered in blood,"" Davis said. ""We assume the injuries occurred the night before.""

Col. Timothy P. Alben, superintendent of the Massachusetts State Police, said the suspect was in ""serious condition.""

""The whole scene is totally surreal,"" Glavish said. ""I mean, this is a very, very quiet neighborhood. ... I pinch myself to realize that this is actually unfolding, literally outside our door. We've been inside all day long, cooped up, and thinking, 'Well, it's on the other side of Watertown, we don't really have to worry.' I took the dog in the backyard a few times. But this is unbelievable.""

Meanwhile The Boston Globe tweets that one of its photographers can hear police talking to a person they believe is the suspect.

""We know you're in there,"" the Globe reports police are saying. ""Come out on your own terms. Come out with your hands up.""

Update at 7:41 p.m. ET. FBI Had Previous Contact With Suspect:

At the end of the investigation, they didn't ""find anything that was enough to allow them to hold onto him.""

Tamerlan's mother told Russia Today, a news organization funded by the Russian government, that her children had been followed by the FBI ""for years."" RT reports:

""Her biggest suspicion surrounding the case was the constant FBI surveillance she said her family was subjected to over the years. She is surprised that having been so stringent with the entire family, the FBI had no idea the sons were supposedly planning a terrorist act.""

Col. Timothy Alben said police went up and down 20 streets, ""door to door"" conducting ""limited searches."" Police followed many leads, but none of them have been fruitful.

""We do not have apprehension ... but we will have one,"" said Alben.

WBUR spoke to Adhi Moro who was friends with both brothers. He gave a little more detail on Tamerlan, the older brother who was killed this morning.

WBUR bulleted highlights from the interview:

Dzhokhar was ""the most popular kid in high school""

Tamerlan was a strong and intimidating guy

Their dad owned a garage where they worked

They didn't really talk about Chechnya or their heritage

Tamerlan declined to go pro as a boxer

Girls loved Dzhokhar in school, but he wasn't too interested

It's less surprising that Tamerlan is accused of these crimes

Their family used to rent a house in Cambridge from a nice older lady

Tamerlan seems to have been a big influence on Dzhokhar

Update at 2:59 p.m. ET. Dzhokhar's Twitter Account?

A classmate of Dzhokhar tells NPR's Andy Carvin that the twitter account @J_Tsar was indeed his. Another classmate tells Buzzfeed the same thing.

Here's what that account tells us, according to NPR's Social Media desk:

-- He has been active since the bombing, last tweet on Wednesday -- He tweeted ""aint no love in the heart of the city, stay safe people"" on the day of the bombing -- He tweets about Chechnya and being proud to be from there -- He tweeted lots of music lyrics - Eminem, Peter Frampton, Michael Jackson, Paul McCartney -- He may have been a 9/11 truther, based on tweets

Dzhokhar also appeared to have an Amazon Wish List. Among the items on it, books on how to forge driver's licenses and books about Chechen history.



Update at 2:22 p.m. ET. 'A Setup':

Radio Liberty, an overseas news service funded by the United States, spoke to Anzor Tsarnaeov, whom they and the AP identified as the suspects' father.

According to an English translation by Sergei Sotnikov, a producer at NPR's Moscow bureau, the father said he could not imagine his sons doing such a thing.

""Knowing our children — you see we know our children — if a person didn't pray how he can go and blow up or something... I don't know. I have never seen either explosives... nothing,"" Tsarnaeov said. Later in the interview he said this was a ""setup.""

This is very much in line with what the suspects' aunt, Maret Tsarnaev, told NPR's Joe Shapiro.

""This totally doesn't make sense to me,"" she said, adding that authorities had not released definitive proof that these were the people responsible for the Boston blasts.

""Tamerlan and Dzhokhar never were extremists,"" Tsarnaeve said. ""Never had enemies. Never had any — of course everybody has opinion on every issue. But does mean that you live with it, and you would go for a heinous ugly act? Like happened on that marathon street in Boston. And again, all I can see these two boys are walking on the street.""

-- While the family is Chechnyan, it lived in Chechnya for just one year, in 1994. Like many Chechnyans, members of the family were forced to flee during World War II and spent decades in Kyrgyzstan.

-- Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the older suspect who was died early Friday, became a more devout Muslim in recent years. But she does not believe he carried a hatred toward other religions and says he fathered a child by a Christian woman.

NPR's Liz Halloran reports that:

-- Dzhokhar Tsarnaev graduated from Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, where in 2011 his wrestling prowess earned him a citation as one of the ""Greater Boston League Winter All Stars."" A former teacher at the school described him to The Boston Globe as having a ""heart of gold.""

On Vkontakte — described as the Russian equivalent of Facebook — he lists his personal priority as ""Career and money,"" and his world view as ""Islam.""

-- Tamerlan Tsarnaev was a boxer and participated in a 2009 New England Golden Gloves tournament, where he was described as being from Lowell, Mass. The Lowell Sun newspaper reported that he won his first fight in 2004, and was quoted as saying: ""I like the USA. America has a lot of jobs. That's something Russia doesn't have.""

Update at 10:20 a.m. ET. How Did ""A Beautiful, Beautiful Boy"" Get Involved?

""It's stunning,"" WBUR host Robin Young says of hearing that 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is the fugitive who's suspected of being one of the young men who planted the bombs at the Boston Marathon and now of being involved in deadly gun battles with police. ""I had the prom party for that class in my back yard,"" she says of Cambridge Rindge & Latin High School students, who included Tsarnaev and Young's nephew Zolan.

The fugitive, she says, was ""the light of the party ... a beautiful, beautiful boy."" But when she saw the photo released early Friday of a suspect robbing a convenience story, she could tell it was him. Young's family has known Dzhokhar Tsarnaev since he was a young high school student and she saw ""no sign of this ... no sign.""

Update at 9:55 a.m. ET. ""I'm Shocked,"" Says Friend Of Fugitive:

If anyone says that 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's ""character, attitude ... or activities that he did daily"" would have indicated he was likely to bomb the marathon or engage in shootouts with police, ""they're absolutely lying,"" says a friend of the fugitive. Zolan Young, nephew of WBUR's Robin Young, spoke with Morning Edition moments ago. He's known Dzhokhar Tsarnaev since they were both in high school.

""I can't emphasize how much a courteous guy he was,"" Zolan Young said. ""This was someone that I could always count on."" The last time Young heard from Tsarnaev was during this year's Super Bowl, when Tsarnaev texted him to ask if Young was having a party.

""I'm shocked,"" said Zolan Young. ""This is one of my friends.""

Update at 9:40 a.m. ET. Who Are These Brothers? Some Clues On Social Media:

As people search for information about the suspects, they're coming on some interesting material on social media sites. Bear in mind: It will be hours, if not days, before material on such sites can be verified. One that's getting particular attention: This photo gallery of a young man identified as Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the suspect who died after a gun fight with police. This caption is under one photo: ""Originally from Chechnya, but living in the United States since five years, Tamerlan says: 'I don't have a single American friend, I don't understand them.' "" There's a page reported to be about Djohar Tsarnaev here (we're seeing his named spelled as ""Dzhokhar"" in other places).

Update at 9:15 a.m. ET. Suspects' Uncle Says ""They Do Not Deserve To Live On This Earth"":

WBZ-TV has spoken with Ruslan Tsarni, identified as the suspects' uncle, who says of his nephew Tamerlan's death, ""he deserved his."" Tsarni added that ""they do not deserve to live on this earth.""

Update at 8:30 a.m. ET. Suspect Had ""Multiple Traumatic Injuries"":

Soon after, an injured man — the bombing suspect now identified as 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was brought in. He had ""multiple traumatic injuries,"" Schoenfeld says, from ""bullet wounds or shrapnel."" Doctors worked to keep him alive, but it was quickly apparent that their efforts would not be successful.

Update at 8:25 a.m. ET. Fugitive Drove Toward Police, Made Escape:

""From the Middlesex County DA's Office: ""Police are investigating a fatal shooting of MIT campus police officer by two men who then committed an armed carjacking in Cambridge, Middlesex Acting District Attorney Michael Pelgro, Cambridge Police Commissioner Robert Haas, and MIT Police Chief John DiFava announced this evening. ""At approximately 10:20 p.m. April 18, police received reports of shots fired on the MIT campus. At 10:30 p.m., an MIT campus police officer was found shot in his vehicle in the area of Vassar and Main streets. According to authorities, the officer was found evidencing multiple gunshot wounds. ""He was transported to Massachusetts General Hospital and pronounced deceased. ""Authorities launched an immediate investigation into the circumstances of the shooting.

""At that time, explosive devices were reportedly thrown from car by the suspects. The suspects and police also exchanged gunfire in the area of Dexter and Laurel streets. During this pursuit, an MBTA Police officer was seriously injured and transported to the hospital.

It was unclear if the outbursts of violence were related. ... ""The officer had been responding to report of a disturbance Thursday night when he was shot multiple times, according to a statement from the Middlesex district attorney's office and Cambridge police. It said there were no other victims. ""Meanwhile, in Watertown, witnesses reported hearing multiple gunshots and explosions at about 1 a.m. Friday. Dozens of police officers and FBI agents were in the neighborhood and a helicopter circled overhead.""

Note: As happens when stories such as this are developing, there will likely be reports that turn out to be mistaken. Wednesday, for example, there were reports from CNN, the AP, WBUR and others that authorities either had arrested a suspect or were about to do that. It turned out that no one had been arrested or taken into custody. We will focus on news being reported by NPR, other news outlets with expertise, and statements from authorities who are in a position to know what's going on. And if some of that information turns out to be wrong, we'll update.

He defends the use of drones against terror suspects overseas
Obama makes new push to close Guantanamo Bay detention facility in Cuba
President Barack Obama recast the U.S. fight against terrorism as no longer a `` boundless global war '' but a targeted effort to dismantle specific extremist networks .
He said America was at a `` crossroads '' and should no longer see it as a `` self-defeating '' perpetual fight , but one that must at some point end , `` like all wars . ''
Obama said `` the core of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan is on a path to defeat , '' but its affiliates elsewhere pose dangers . He also touched on new overseas and homegrown threats , and explained publicly the use of drones against terror suspects overseas .
He renewed his push to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and also sought to calm criticism around his administration 's investigation of national security leaks .

He even paused his prepared remarks to take on a woman in the audience from `` Code Pink '' who interrupted him several times in open disagreement .
`` I think that the , and I 'm going off script as you might expect here .... the voice of that woman is worth paying attention to , '' Obama said to applause . `` Obviously I do not agree with much of what she said and obviously she was n't listening to me in what I said but these are tough issues and the suggestion that we can gloss over them is wrong . ''
The Obama administration for the first time revealed Wednesday that drones had killed four American citizens since 2009 . Obama used the speech to more definitively explain the U.S. policy on the use of lethal force and sought stricter review of its use .
Still , he said drones were both legal and effective to combat terrorists , and added that Americans overseas who wish to do the United States harm were fair game , in the most extreme cases .
`` When a U.S. citizen goes abroad to wage war against America -- and is actively plotting to kill U.S. citizens ; and when neither the United States , nor our partners are in a position to capture him before he carries out a plot -- his citizenship should no more serve as a shield than a sniper shooting down on an innocent crowd should be protected from a SWAT team , '' Obama said .
He said ordering strikes is a heavy burden , but added that `` to do nothing in the face of terrorist networks would invite far more civilian casualties . ''
Obama said he is asking his administration to review proposals to extend oversight of lethal actions outside of war zones that go beyond reporting to Congress .
CNN 's senior political analyst Gloria Borger says Obama defends the use of drones .
`` But he also really acknowledged that it can be overused , even by a president , and that you can not just depend on drones for your national security . ''
When he was first elected in 2008 , Obama vowed to shut down the military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay , also known as Gitmo .
But in the years since , Congress has enacted significant restrictions on the transfer of detainees from the prison that made its closure impractical . And , as costs of running the facility balloon and detainees wage hunger strikes protesting their imprisonment , the administration has quietly dialed back the intensity of the push to shut down the facility .
`` The original premise for opening GTMO -- that detainees would not be able to challenge their detention -- was found unconstitutional five years ago , '' said Obama . `` In the meantime , GTMO has become a symbol around the world for an America that flouts the rule of law . ''
He called on Congress to `` lift the restrictions on detainee transfers from GTMO , '' appointed a special envoy to `` achieve the transfer of detainees to third countries , '' and lifted the moratorium on detainee transfers to Yemen , where 56 of Gitmo 's 86 detainees are from .
3 . No leaks , but there 's that freedom of the press thing ...
Obama has come under fire for recent investigations into leaks by his Justice Department where phone records were seized from reporters and editors at The Associated Press and a Fox News reporter was labeled in a Justice Department affidavit as `` potentially being an 'aider and abettor and/or co-conspirator ' '' to the crime of disclosing secret information .
So he used the speech to try to quell criticism for those intrusions .
`` As commander-in-chief , I believe we must keep information secret that protects our operations and our people in the field , '' Obama said . `` But a free press is also essential for our democracy . I am troubled by the possibility that leak investigations may chill the investigative journalism that holds government accountable . ''
`` Journalists should not be at legal risk for doing their jobs . Our focus must be on those who break the law , '' he added .
He vowed to push for a federal shield law for journalists and convene a group of media organizations to review existing guidelines about investigations that involve reporters .
Obama clearly used the speech to redefine U.S. policy on the so-called `` war on terror , '' acknowledging that where once the battle was fought on foreign soil , the threats have moved .
`` Now make no mistake : our nation is still threatened by terrorists . From Benghazi to Boston , we have been tragically reminded of that truth . We must recognize that the threat has shifted and evolved from the one that came to our shores on 9/11 . With a decade of experience to draw from , now is the time to ask ourselves hard questions - about the nature of today 's threats , and how we should confront them . ''
`` From our use of drones to the detention of terrorist suspects , the decisions we are making now will define the type of nation -- and world -- that we leave to our children , '' Obama said .
`` I was listening to a president who was saying to us , 'Let 's get beyond where we were when I first took office , and let me tell you how my thinking has evolved since I 've been president of the United States , ' '' said CNN 's senior political analyst Gloria Borger . `` He said , 'We must define the nature and scope of this struggle or it will define us . ' ''
But Obama will face opposition as he attempts to shift U.S. policy .
`` Both on drones and on Guantanamo , he 's going to get some pushback , '' said Borger .
A loud woman interrupted the president several times during his speech , calling on Obama to close the Guantanamo Bay facility . But the president was talking about just that when he was interrupted .
`` You are commander-in-chief -- you can close Guantanamo today , '' she yelled . `` It 's been 11 years ! ''
Obama stopped in the middle of his remarks and shot back . `` This is part of free speech , is you being able to speak but also you listening and me being able to speak , alright ? '' Obama said .
The woman was identified as Medea Benjamin , a co-founder of the protest group Code Pink and was later escorted out of the building and released .
Later , he even tweaked his closing line to incorporate the heckler in the audience .
`` Victory will be measured in parents taking their kids to school , immigrants coming to our shores , fans taking in a ballgame , a veteran starting a business ; a bustling city street , a citizen shouting their concerns at a president , '' he concluded .","Story highlights Obama says America at ""crossroads,"" and fight against terror must be more targeted

Obama makes new push to close Guantanamo Bay detention facility in Cuba

Woman interrupts speech, urged Obama take action on ""Gitmo""

President Barack Obama recast the U.S. fight against terrorism as no longer a ""boundless global war"" but a targeted effort to dismantle specific extremist networks.

He said America was at a ""crossroads"" and should no longer see it as a ""self-defeating"" perpetual fight, but one that must at some point end, ""like all wars.""

Obama said ""the core of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan is on a path to defeat,'' but its affiliates elsewhere pose dangers. He also touched on new overseas and homegrown threats, and explained publicly the use of drones against terror suspects overseas.

He renewed his push to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and also sought to calm criticism around his administration's investigation of national security leaks.

Here are five things we learned from the speech:

1. Using drones are OK, but...

The Obama administration for the first time revealed Wednesday that drones had killed four American citizens since 2009 . Obama used the speech to more definitively explain the U.S. policy on the use of lethal force and sought stricter review of its use.

Still, he said drones were both legal and effective to combat terrorists, and added that Americans overseas who wish to do the United States harm were fair game, in the most extreme cases.

""When a U.S. citizen goes abroad to wage war against America -- and is actively plotting to kill U.S. citizens; and when neither the United States, nor our partners are in a position to capture him before he carries out a plot -- his citizenship should no more serve as a shield than a sniper shooting down on an innocent crowd should be protected from a SWAT team,"" Obama said.

He said ordering strikes is a heavy burden, but added that ""to do nothing in the face of terrorist networks would invite far more civilian casualties.""

Obama said he is asking his administration to review proposals to extend oversight of lethal actions outside of war zones that go beyond reporting to Congress.

CNN's senior political analyst Gloria Borger says Obama defends the use of drones.

""But he also really acknowledged that it can be overused, even by a president, and that you cannot just depend on drones for your national security.""

2. I wasn't kidding about closing Gitmo...

When he was first elected in 2008, Obama vowed to shut down the military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, also known as Gitmo.

But in the years since, Congress has enacted significant restrictions on the transfer of detainees from the prison that made its closure impractical. And, as costs of running the facility balloon and detainees wage hunger strikes protesting their imprisonment, the administration has quietly dialed back the intensity of the push to shut down the facility.

But that changed Thursday.

""The original premise for opening GTMO -- that detainees would not be able to challenge their detention -- was found unconstitutional five years ago,"" said Obama. ""In the meantime, GTMO has become a symbol around the world for an America that flouts the rule of law.""

He called on Congress to ""lift the restrictions on detainee transfers from GTMO,"" appointed a special envoy to ""achieve the transfer of detainees to third countries,"" and lifted the moratorium on detainee transfers to Yemen, where 56 of Gitmo's 86 detainees are from.

3. No leaks, but there's that freedom of the press thing...

Obama has come under fire for recent investigations into leaks by his Justice Department where phone records were seized from reporters and editors at The Associated Press and a Fox News reporter was labeled in a Justice Department affidavit as ""potentially being an 'aider and abettor and/or co-conspirator'"" to the crime of disclosing secret information.

So he used the speech to try to quell criticism for those intrusions.

""As commander-in-chief, I believe we must keep information secret that protects our operations and our people in the field,"" Obama said. ""But a free press is also essential for our democracy. I am troubled by the possibility that leak investigations may chill the investigative journalism that holds government accountable.""

""Journalists should not be at legal risk for doing their jobs. Our focus must be on those who break the law,"" he added.

He vowed to push for a federal shield law for journalists and convene a group of media organizations to review existing guidelines about investigations that involve reporters.

4. A new term brings a new policy

Obama clearly used the speech to redefine U.S. policy on the so-called ""war on terror,"" acknowledging that where once the battle was fought on foreign soil, the threats have moved.

""Now make no mistake: our nation is still threatened by terrorists. From Benghazi to Boston, we have been tragically reminded of that truth. We must recognize that the threat has shifted and evolved from the one that came to our shores on 9/11. With a decade of experience to draw from, now is the time to ask ourselves hard questions - about the nature of today's threats, and how we should confront them.""

""From our use of drones to the detention of terrorist suspects, the decisions we are making now will define the type of nation -- and world -- that we leave to our children,"" Obama said.

""I was listening to a president who was saying to us, 'Let's get beyond where we were when I first took office, and let me tell you how my thinking has evolved since I've been president of the United States,'"" said CNN's senior political analyst Gloria Borger. ""He said, 'We must define the nature and scope of this struggle or it will define us.'""

But Obama will face opposition as he attempts to shift U.S. policy.

""Both on drones and on Guantanamo, he's going to get some pushback,"" said Borger.

5. Free speech also means 'you listen'

A loud woman interrupted the president several times during his speech, calling on Obama to close the Guantanamo Bay facility. But the president was talking about just that when he was interrupted.

""You are commander-in-chief -- you can close Guantanamo today,"" she yelled. ""It's been 11 years!""

Obama stopped in the middle of his remarks and shot back. ""This is part of free speech, is you being able to speak but also you listening and me being able to speak, alright?"" Obama said.

The woman was identified as Medea Benjamin, a co-founder of the protest group Code Pink and was later escorted out of the building and released.

Later, he even tweaked his closing line to incorporate the heckler in the audience.

""Victory will be measured in parents taking their kids to school, immigrants coming to our shores, fans taking in a ballgame, a veteran starting a business; a bustling city street, a citizen shouting their concerns at a president,"" he concluded.",www.cnn.com,left,WQu1cNHpnhtCOMnD

""Most of the militants responsible for terrorist attacks in Russia over the last decade -- including female suicide bombers who have taken part in 20 attacks claiming at least 780 lives since June 2000 -- have come from Dagestan,"" RIA Novosti reported Monday.

The two young men behind the Boston Marathon bombings lived briefly in Dagestan before coming to the United States, and one of them visited the area the year before the attack.

""Radical Islamist groups tied to the war against the Russian state now have much deeper roots, and are far more active, in Dagestan than in Chechnya,"" Rajan Menon, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, wrote in a CNN.com column

Putin has maintained that the Sochi games will be safe and security will be tight. Visitors to Sochi and the surrounding area are subjected to rigorous security checks, and vehicle license plates are monitored.

""This will probably be one of the most difficult Olympics to actually go as a spectator and watch the Games because of the myriad layers of security,"" Republican Rep. Michael Grimm of New York told CNN on Monday.

Other parts of Russia

However, the Volgograd explosions showed the challenge that Russian authorities face in policing the rest of the country amid ongoing unrest in the North Caucasus. That region includes Chechnya, where Russia fought two wars against separatist movements, and Dagestan.

With tight security around Sochi itself, terrorists are believed to be focusing on other parts of the North Caucasus and southern Russia.

RIA Novosti reported a car bomb killed three people on Friday in Pyatigorsk in southern Russia, about 160 miles (270 kilometers) east of Sochi.

""Rarely do you actually have a terrorist group come out and say, 'We're going to try and disrupt these games,'"" CNN national security analyst Fran Townsend said Monday. ""When al Qaeda-related affinity groups make these sort of statements, you've got to take them at their word.""

The fact that the bombers are targeting transportation is ""not lost on Olympic Committee organizers and security officials,"" she added.

Athletes are ""most vulnerable"" when moving between the Olympic Village and the sites of their events, she said.

Townsend, who coordinated with Greek officials before the Olympics in Athens in 2004, said security officials all over the world will be asking Russia for detailed information about these attacks, including whether there were any indications or warnings.

They'll also ask about what information Russian intelligence has on the capabilities of terrorist groups to pull off further attacks.",www.cnn.com,left,lDF0l8NuCSbkhPzd

Officials: 2011 wiretap reveals talk of jihad

In the past few days, Russian authorities turned over an intercepted conversation from 2011 between one of the Tsarnaev brothers in the United States and their mother in Dagestan, Russia, according to an official with knowledge of the investigation.

The wiretapped communication discussed jihad, but the conversation was vague, according to two U.S. officials. It's unclear why the Russians were eavesdropping on the mother or for how long.

One of the officials declined to say whether that wiretap information could have made a difference in ultimately uncovering a future attack on the United States.

Tom Fuentes, a CNN contributor and former FBI assistant director, said the FBI would have found that information helpful when the Russians asked U.S. investigators to look into Tamerlan Tsarnaev for a possible shift toward increasing Islamic extremism in 2011.

Family in Russia

The brothers' mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaev, said Friday that she and her husband had left their home in Dagestan for another part of Russia.

Their father, Anzor Tsarnaev, had said he'd planned to travel to the United States, but that trip has been delayed indefinitely for health reasons.

The mother has said she will not return to the United States, where she is wanted on felony charges of shoplifting and destruction of property.

The family lived in Massachusetts before Zubeidat Tsarnaev jumped bail after her arrest on the charges in 2012. The parents moved to Dagestan, a semiautonomous republic in southern Russia that year.

Zubeidat Tsarnaev has denied the reality of the bombing. She believes it was fake. She said she has seen a video pushing the wild idea, and that there was no blood, that paint was used instead.

Botched hijacking thwarts plans to head to New York

Three days after the marathon attack, and hours after authorities released images of the two suspects, they spontaneously decided to go to New York's Times Square to blow up their six remaining explosives, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told investigators.

But a botched carjacking spoiled the impromptu road trip, said Tsarnaev, whose account was outlined by New York's police commissioner.

Before forcing their way into a vehicle the night of April 18, the brothers fatally shot a campus police officer at MIT , police said.

The vehicle they subsequently hijacked, a Mercedes sport utility vehicle, ran low on fuel, and they stopped at a service station, where the vehicle's owner escaped. Shortly thereafter, police picked up the trail of the SUV and pursued it. Authorities say the men threw bombs out the vehicle's window at them.

At an interfaith service, Obama tells Boston attackers: ""We will find you""

After three days of poring over photos and video, investigators appealed to the public to help them identify two men now considered suspects in the Boston Marathon bombings.

The men were photographed walking down Boylston Street, one behind the other, near the finish line of Monday's race.

Suspect 1 was seen wearing a light-colored, collarless shirt underneath a dark-colored jacket and wearing a dark baseball cap.

The man identified as Suspect 2 was seen setting down a backpack at the site of the second explosion ""within minutes"" of the blasts that killed three people and wounded nearly 180, said Special Agent Rick DesLauriers, the head of the FBI's Boston office. He was wearing a light-colored hooded sweatshirt, a black jacket and a white baseball cap turned backward.

In particular, DesLauriers asked for help from anyone standing in front of the Forum restaurant, where the second bombing happened.

The UK Independent is reporting that the attack on Nice would have been even more horrendous , but for the heroic actions of an as-yet unidentified man who threw himself into the cab of the truck when it struck an obstacle , and wrestled with the murderous driver , who was armed with a revolver .
“ A person jumped on to the truck to try to stop it , ” reported an eyewitness . “ It ’ s at that moment that the police were able to neutralize this terrorist . I won ’ t forget the look of this policewoman who intercepted the killer . ”
The BBC quotes former French Europe Minister Pierre Lellouche , who participated in an inquiry into last year ’ s Paris attacks , strongly criticizing France ’ s response to the terrorist threat . He dismissed the extended state of emergency declared by President Hollande as a “ joke . ”
“ We need much better intelligence , much better coordination of intelligence inside France , among Europeans , with our neighbors controlling our borders – particularly the Turks . This is not happening fast enough , ” Lellouche told the BBC .
Lellouche made the devastating observation that “ a violent tactic from the Syrian civil war has now come to the streets of Nice , ” so “ the Middle East and Europe are now part of what he calls the same strategic space , ” as the BBC put it after interviewing him .

Breitbart Jerusalem says that a top Salafist jihadist based in the Gaza Strip has claimed more “ brothers ” are planning attacks .
Abu Alayna Al-Ansari , an IS loyalist , said he believes the attack was a “ classic lone wolf ” operation , inspired by the jihadi Abu Mohammad al-Julani , the IS spokesperson , who called upon young Muslims from around the world to carry out attacks such as Thursday night ’ s . Ansari is a well-known Gazan Salafist jihadist allied with Islamic State ideology . In previous interviews , Ansari seemed to be speaking as an actual IS member , repeatedly using the pronoun “ we ” when referring to IS and even seemingly making declarations on behalf of IS .

“ There are 50 other people who are still receiving emergency treatment . They are between life and death . Amongst the victims are French citizens as well as foreigners , who came from all continents . And there are a number of young children who came to watch fireworks with their families , who have been struck down just to satisfy the cruelty of one individual or possible of a group. ” “ We have visited scores of injured , who have horrendous images in their heads . They are suffering more because of the psychological trauma . Even people who have no signs of physical injury , will carry throughout their lives the trauma of the horrific images they saw . ”
“ As I speak 84 people are dead , and around 50 are in a critical condition between life and death , ” French President Hollande said after visiting a hospital in the French Riviera city .

“ My thoughts go out to the friends and families of those who died and of course it is heartbreaking that there are young children involved but these terrorists have no limits to their murder . “ Once again this highlights the foolishness of open borders with not only 1.8 million migrants coming in but free movement of weapons probably including those which were found in the cab of the lorry . “ As Home Secretary Mrs May oversaw the collapse in funding and support for the UK border force and I would have thought as a new prime minister hitting the ground running , , making COBRA her first responsibility . “ She should have used it to show her intention to get a grip of this crisis . Mr Hookem said he thought the criticism of the new Prime Minster over her twitter response was “ shallow ” saying , “ What we need is actions not words. ” “ Mr Cameron may well have responded on twitter but what we really need is to have better border security and to raise the level of the alert . “ But fundamentally what we are desperately in need of a strong border force with investment in people and technology . ”

“ I am shocked and saddened by the horrifying attack in Nice last night . Our hearts go out to the French people and to all those who ’ ve lost loved ones or been injured . “ While the full picture is still emerging , it seems that at least 80 people are feared dead and many others have been injured . These were innocent victims enjoying a national celebration with their friends and families . “ We are working urgently to establish whether any British nationals were caught up in the attack . Our ambassador is travelling to Nice today with consular staff and they will be doing all they can to help anyone affected . “ I have asked my deputy national security adviser to chair a COBRA meeting of senior officials , to review what we know and what we can do to help , and I will speak to President Hollande today and make clear that the United Kingdom stands shoulder to shoulder with France today , as we have done so often in the past . “ If , as we fear , this was a terrorist attack , then we must redouble our efforts to defeat these brutal murderers who want to destroy our way of life . We must work with France and our partners around the world to stand up for our values and for our freedom . ”
“ Nothing that we have proposed has been put in place . Considering the new nature of terrorism which is now a terrorism of opportunity , that ’ s to say without hierarchical structure , the urgency is to attack the ideology on which this terrorism is based . “ And in this space , nothing has been done , absolutely nothing – no reintroduction of double punishment , nor depriving people of nationality , nor the closure of salafist mosques… nor the banning of certain organisations . In truth we are not at war . For the moment , we are in a war of words . ”

Police are treating the incident as “an attack” and French President François Hollande declared it an “undeniable” terrorist attack.

The suspect has been named locally as a 31-year-old French-Tunisian called Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel. Witnesses claim he shouted “Allahu Akbar” – which means God is greatest in Arabic – before opening fire on officers.

Update 1910 BST (1410 EST)

The UK Independent is reporting that the attack on Nice would have been even more horrendous, but for the heroic actions of an as-yet unidentified man who threw himself into the cab of the truck when it struck an obstacle, and wrestled with the murderous driver, who was armed with a revolver.

“A person jumped on to the truck to try to stop it,” reported an eyewitness. “It’s at that moment that the police were able to neutralize this terrorist. I won’t forget the look of this policewoman who intercepted the killer.”

Update 1900 BST (1400 EST)

The BBC quotes former French Europe Minister Pierre Lellouche, who participated in an inquiry into last year’s Paris attacks, strongly criticizing France’s response to the terrorist threat. He dismissed the extended state of emergency declared by President Hollande as a “joke.”

“We need much better intelligence, much better coordination of intelligence inside France, among Europeans, with our neighbors controlling our borders – particularly the Turks. This is not happening fast enough,” Lellouche told the BBC.

Lellouche made the devastating observation that “a violent tactic from the Syrian civil war has now come to the streets of Nice,” so “the Middle East and Europe are now part of what he calls the same strategic space,” as the BBC put it after interviewing him.

Breitbart Jerusalem says that a top Salafist jihadist based in the Gaza Strip has claimed more “brothers” are planning attacks.

Abu Alayna Al-Ansari, an IS loyalist, said he believes the attack was a “classic lone wolf” operation, inspired by the jihadi Abu Mohammad al-Julani, the IS spokesperson, who called upon young Muslims from around the world to carry out attacks such as Thursday night’s. Ansari is a well-known Gazan Salafist jihadist allied with Islamic State ideology. In previous interviews, Ansari seemed to be speaking as an actual IS member, repeatedly using the pronoun “we” when referring to IS and even seemingly making declarations on behalf of IS.

UKIP criticises British PM Theresa May for not taking a more hands-on approach in response to the Nice attack.

Mike Hookem MEP, the party’s defence spokesman, said:

“My thoughts go out to the friends and families of those who died and of course it is heartbreaking that there are young children involved but these terrorists have no limits to their murder. “Once again this highlights the foolishness of open borders with not only 1.8 million migrants coming in but free movement of weapons probably including those which were found in the cab of the lorry. “As Home Secretary Mrs May oversaw the collapse in funding and support for the UK border force and I would have thought as a new prime minister hitting the ground running, ,making COBRA her first responsibility. “She should have used it to show her intention to get a grip of this crisis. Mr Hookem said he thought the criticism of the new Prime Minster over her twitter response was “shallow” saying, “What we need is actions not words.” “Mr Cameron may well have responded on twitter but what we really need is to have better border security and to raise the level of the alert. “But fundamentally what we are desperately in need of a strong border force with investment in people and technology.”

“I am shocked and saddened by the horrifying attack in Nice last night. Our hearts go out to the French people and to all those who’ve lost loved ones or been injured. “While the full picture is still emerging, it seems that at least 80 people are feared dead and many others have been injured. These were innocent victims enjoying a national celebration with their friends and families. “We are working urgently to establish whether any British nationals were caught up in the attack. Our ambassador is travelling to Nice today with consular staff and they will be doing all they can to help anyone affected. “I have asked my deputy national security adviser to chair a COBRA meeting of senior officials, to review what we know and what we can do to help, and I will speak to President Hollande today and make clear that the United Kingdom stands shoulder to shoulder with France today, as we have done so often in the past. “If, as we fear, this was a terrorist attack, then we must redouble our efforts to defeat these brutal murderers who want to destroy our way of life. We must work with France and our partners around the world to stand up for our values and for our freedom.”

Update 1138 BST

Marine Le Pen speaks out:

“Nothing that we have proposed has been put in place. Considering the new nature of terrorism which is now a terrorism of opportunity, that’s to say without hierarchical structure, the urgency is to attack the ideology on which this terrorism is based. “And in this space, nothing has been done, absolutely nothing – no reintroduction of double punishment, nor depriving people of nationality, nor the closure of salafist mosques… nor the banning of certain organisations. In truth we are not at war. For the moment, we are in a war of words.”

Breitbart London reported Tuesday on the remarks of the head of the French security service Director General Patrick Calvar who said if there was another Islamist Terror attack against his country he foresaw a “civil war” coming. Predicting what he called “far-right” groups would begin reprisals against Muslims in France for the attacks, he said: ” You will have a confrontation between the far right and the Muslim world – not the Islamists, but the Muslim world”.

A police source said the Director General feared another big terror attack particularly because it would prove to the French people that their government lacked the resources or ability to stop terrorism, leading to a rise of vigilantism.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

July 14, 2016

Statement by the President on the Attack in Nice, France

On behalf of the American people, I condemn in the strongest terms what appears to be a horrific terrorist attack in Nice, France, which killed and wounded dozens of innocent civilians. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and other loved ones of those killed, and we wish a full recovery for the many wounded. I have directed my team to be in touch with French officials, and we have offered any assistance that they may need to investigate this attack and bring those responsible to justice. We stand in solidarity and partnership with France, our oldest ally, as they respond to and recover from this attack.

On this Bastille Day, we are reminded of the extraordinary resilience and democratic values that have made France an inspiration to the entire world, and we know that the character of the French Republic will endure long after this devastating and tragic loss of life.

Update: 7:11PM EDT: Journalist Damien German has posted his account of being on the ground in Nice during the attack on the forum Medium in French. He recounts in part:

In the distance a noise. Shouts. My first thought: a delinquent wanted to fire his own little fireworks and has not mastered how to do it… But no. A split second later, a huge white truck was traveling at breakneck speed over people… This truck of death passed a few meters from me and I did not realize it. I saw bodies flying like bowling pins in its path. Heard noises, screams that I will never forget. I was paralyzed. I did not move. I followed this hearse with me eyes. Around me, there was panic. People were running, screaming, crying. Then I realized. And I ran with them… Blood. Groans. Sunbathers [on the beach near the promenade] were first at the scene. They brought water to the wounded and towels they filed where there was no hope. At this time, I lacked courage. I wanted to help, to be of service… in short to do something. But I did not succeed.

Update: 7:02PM EDT: Le Monde reports that the Interior Ministry cannot confirm rumors that grenades or explosives were found in the truck, which are circulating in French social media.

Update: 6:56PM EDT: According to the outlet Le Figaro, the current death toll stands at 73:

Welch","PARIS — Authorities identified three suspects in a deadly shooting attack on a satirical newspaper that killed 12 people Wednesday as thousands jammed a public square for an evening vigil honoring victims of France 's deadliest terror attack in a half century .
Two of those killed were police officers , one of them shot dead on a sidewalk outside the newspaper . Eight journalists were among the victims .
The suspects are two brothers — Said , 34 , and Cherif Kouachi , 32 , both French nationals — and Hamyd Mourad , 18 , whose nationality was n't known , a Paris police official told the Associated Press . He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly .

PARIS — Authorities identified three suspects in a deadly shooting attack on a satirical newspaper that killed 12 people Wednesday as thousands jammed a public square for an evening vigil honoring victims of France's deadliest terror attack in a half century.

Two of those killed were police officers, one of them shot dead on a sidewalk outside the newspaper. Eight journalists were among the victims.

The suspects are two brothers — Said, 34, and Cherif Kouachi, 32, both French nationals — and Hamyd Mourad, 18, whose nationality wasn't known, a Paris police official told the Associated Press. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.

The youngest suspect surrendered at a police station in Charleville-Mezieres, a small town in France's eastern Champagne region, Paris prosecutor's spokeswoman Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre said. French police early Thursday released photos of the brothers they were seeking, saying they should be considered armed and dangerous.

French news media reported late Wednesday that a major police operation was taking place around an apartment building in Reims, about 90 miles northeast of Paris.

The brothers were born in Paris of Algerian descent. Cherif was sentenced to three years in prison on terrorism charges in May 2008. Both brothers returned from Syria this summer.

Officials have identified the suspect as Sayfullo Saipov , an immigrant who moved to the US legally from Uzbekistan in 2010 . He was shot in the abdomen by a New York City police officer at the scene , and is currently in custody at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan . Police have interviewed him and are currently waiting for an update on his condition .
There is not yet any evidence that Saipov had direct connections to or support from terrorist groups , but investigators that the attack was premeditated and inspired by ISIS .
“ It appears that Mr. Saipov had been planning this for a number of weeks — he did this in the name of ISIS , ” John Miller , the New York deputy police commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism , said at a news briefing on Wednesday . “ He appears to have followed , almost exactly to a T , the instructions that ISIS has put out in its social media channels before with instructions to their followers on how to carry out such an attack . ”
“ It appears he will have some connectivity to individuals who were the subjects of investigations , though he himself was not , '' Miller said .
New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo said on Wednesday during an appearance on CNN ’ s New Day that investigators believe Saipov was a lone wolf who was “ radicalized domestically ” after coming to the United States .
“ After he came to the United States is when he started to become informed about ISIS and radical Islamic tactics , ” Cuomo said . “ We have no evidence yet of associations or continuing plot or associated plots , and our only evidence to date is that this was an isolated incident that he himself performed . ”
According to officials , Saipov left a note in the truck pledging allegiance to ISIS , which said in Arabic , “ The Islamic State will endure forever . ”
President Trump tweeted on Tuesday night that he has ordered the Department of Homeland of Security to “ step up our already Extreme Vetting Program . ”
“ Being politically correct is fine , but not for this ! ” he continued .
And on Wednesday , he blamed the attack on immigration policies promoted by Democrats that he thought were too generous .
“ The terrorist came into our country through what is called the ‘ Diversity Visa Lottery Program , ’ a Chuck Schumer beauty . I want merit based , ” he tweeted .
Six people died at the scene , while two others died at a nearby hospital . Five of them were friends from Argentina celebrating a graduation anniversary . An unnamed Belgian woman is also among the dead . Two others remain unidentified .
At around 3:05 pm Tuesday , the suspect drove a pickup truck southbound down the bike path at high speed along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan , police officials say .
The truck driver started his rampage near Houston Street , tearing down approximately 20 city blocks on a bike path along the Hudson River popular with cyclists and runners .
The truck came to a stop after it collided with a school bus near Stuyvesant High School , near Chambers Street , officials say . After the crash , the suspect got out of the truck brandishing a paintball and pellet gun .
At least four passengers — two adults and two children — were on the school bus when the pickup driver slammed into it . The children are among the injured .

The suspect yelled , “ Allahu Akbar , ” Arabic for “ God is great , ” after he emerged from truck , according to reports multiple eyewitnesses , including law enforcement officials .
De Blasio called New Yorkers “ resilient ” and condemned the attack as “ cowardly ” in a tweet on Tuesday .
On Twitter on Tuesday Trump called the attacker “ a very sick and deranged person , ” and said “ we must not allow ISIS to return. ” He later offered his condolences to “ the victims and families of the New York City terrorist attack . ”
The White House released an official statement from the president Tuesday evening . “ My administration will provide its full support to the New York City Police Department , including through a joint investigation with the Federal Bureau of Investigation , ” the statement read .

The suspect yelled, “Allahu Akbar,” Arabic for “God is great,” after he emerged from truck, according to reports multiple eyewitnesses, including law enforcement officials.

De Blasio called New Yorkers “resilient” and condemned the attack as “cowardly” in a tweet on Tuesday.

On Twitter on Tuesday Trump called the attacker “a very sick and deranged person,” and said “we must not allow ISIS to return.” He later offered his condolences to “the victims and families of the New York City terrorist attack.”

The White House released an official statement from the president Tuesday evening. “My administration will provide its full support to the New York City Police Department, including through a joint investigation with the Federal Bureau of Investigation,” the statement read.

Christchurch, New Zealand (AP) -- A white supremacist suspected in shootings at two mosques that killed 49 people during midday Friday prayers posted an anti-immigrant manifesto online and apparently used a helmet-mounted camera to broadcast live video of the slaughter on Facebook.

Brenton Harrison Tarrant appeared in court Saturday morning amid strict security and showed no emotion when the judge read him one murder charge. The judge said ""it was reasonable to assume"" more such charges would follow.

Two other armed suspects were taken into custody while police tried to determine what role, if any, they played in the cold-blooded attack that stunned New Zealand, a country so peaceful that police officers rarely carry guns.

It was by far the deadliest shooting in modern New Zealand history.

""It is clear that this can now only be described as a terrorist attack,"" Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said, noting that many of the victims could be migrants or refugees.

She pronounced it ""one of New Zealand's darkest days.""

Tarrant, who police say carried out at least one of the shootings, posted a jumbled, 74-page manifesto on social media in which he identified himself as a 28-year-old Australian and white supremacist who was out to avenge attacks in Europe perpetrated by Muslims.

The family of a man arrested after a terror attack near a London mosque say they are ""shocked"" and ""devastated"".

Father-of-four Darren Osborne, 47, was held on suspicion of attempted murder and alleged terror offences after a van hit Muslims in Finsbury Park.

They had been helping a man who had collapsed. He later died but it is not clear if it was because of the attack.

Met Police chief Cressida Dick and faith leaders were among hundreds who took part in a vigil on Monday night.

'Hasn't sunk in'

Ms Dick said the incident was ""quite clearly an attack on Muslims"", and the community would now see more police, including armed officers, in the area, ""particularly around religious establishments"".

Mr Osborne's mother, sister and nephew said in a statement: ""We are massively in shock, it's unbelievable. It still hasn't really sunk in.""

They added that their ""hearts go out to those who've been injured"".

Police have carried out searches at an address in the Cardiff area.

Security Minister Ben Wallace said the suspect was not known to the security services, and was believed to have acted alone.

The BBC understands Mr Osborne grew up in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, and has lived at more than one property in Cardiff. He is also believed to have lived in Swindon.

Investigators have pinpointed two men as `` possible suspects '' who were seen in images near the finish line of this week 's Boston Marathon -- moments before twin bombs there exploded , killing three and injuring about 180 others -- a law enforcement official said .

Earlier Wednesday , two official sources with knowledge of the investigation identified a man -- who also has n't been named -- as a possible suspect in the attack .

Speaking on CNN 's The Situation Room , Massachusetts Gov . Deval Patrick said investigators were closer to cracking the case `` every hour . '' But he urged patience with the probe .
`` What I would say and I would ask of everyone is we give law enforcement the space to do their work , '' Patrick said . `` When they are ready with a complete picture , they will tell us what that picture is . ''
He added , `` I wish they had nailed the perpetrator within minutes of this catastrophe , but I understand from experience it 's going to take some time . ''
Earlier Wednesday , investigators revealed more details about the makeup of the bombs , which exploded 12 seconds apart . One had been housed in a pressure cooker hidden inside a backpack , the FBI said in a joint intelligence bulletin . The device also had fragments that may have included nails , BBs and ball bearings , the agency said .
The lid of a pressure cooker thought to be used in the device was found on a rooftop at the scene , a federal law enforcement official with firsthand knowledge of the investigation told CNN .
The second bomb was also housed in a metal container , but it was not clear whether it too was in a pressure cooker , the FBI said .
The U.S. government has warned federal agencies in the past that terrorists could turn pressure cookers into bombs by packing them with explosives and shrapnel and detonating them with blasting caps .
Photos obtained by CNN show the remains of a pressure cooker found at the scene , along with a shredded black backpack and what appear to be metal pellets or ball bearings . Scraps of at least one pressure cooker , nails and nylon bags found at the scene were sent to the FBI 's national laboratory in Virginia , where technicians will try to reconstruct the devices , the agent leading the investigation said Tuesday .
The pieces suggest each of the devices was 6 liters ( about 1.6 gallons ) in volume , a Boston law enforcement source said . The recovered parts include part of a circuit board , which might have been used to detonate a device .
A law enforcement official said Monday 's bombs were probably detonated by timers . But the FBI said details of the detonating system were unknown .
While the clues moved the investigation forward , they did not make it immediately apparent whether the attack was an act of domestic or foreign terrorism .
`` If your experience and your expertise is Middle East terrorism , it has the hallmarks of al Qaeda or a Middle East group , '' former FBI Assistant Director Tom Fuentes said . `` If your experience is domestic groups and bombings that have occurred here , it has the hallmarks of a domestic terrorist like Eric Rudolph in the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympics bombings .

Boston University identified graduate student Lingzi Lu as the third person who died in Monday 's bombings .

Authorities sifted through thousands of pieces of evidence and a mass of digital photos and video clips . They have pleaded for the public 's help in providing additional leads and images .
`` Someone knows who did this , '' said Rick DesLauriers , the special agent in charge of the FBI 's Boston office , said . `` The community will play a crucial role in this investigation . ''
Medical personnel treating the wounded found evidence suggesting the bomb maker or bomb makers sought to maximize the suffering .
Dr. George Velmahos , head of trauma care at Massachusetts General Hospital , said his team found `` numerous '' metal pellets and nails inside patients ' bodies .
`` There are people who have 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 of them in their body , or more , '' Velmahos said .
Dr. Ron Walls also said one patient had more than 12 carpenter-type nails .

`` We were having a great day and waiting to see our friend cross the finish line , '' he said , `` and then all of the sudden it turned in a flash . ''
He told CNN he 's worried about the financial burdens his friends could face as a result of the explosion .
One friend is a carpenter and `` both his hands are incinerated . He ca n't go to work , and the bills keep coming in . ''
`` It 's not just the hospitals . It 's everyday life that does n't stop . ... We 're just hoping the mayor , the governor , President Obama do n't let us as citizens down . ''

Photos obtained by CNN show the remains of a pressure cooker found at the scene, along with a shredded black backpack and what appear to be metal pellets or ball bearings.

Fuentes said he has investigated both types of terrorism -- from Iraq to the United States -- and finds the Boston attack has elements of both. ""It has the hallmarks of both domestic and international (attacks), and you can see either side of that.""

Third victim identified

Boston University identified graduate student Lingzi Lu as the third person who died in Monday's bombings.

Previously identified were Krystle Campbell, 29, of Arlington, Massachusetts, and Martin Richard, 8, of Dorchester, Massachusetts.

""She was the best,"" Campbell's distraught mother, Patty, told reporters Tuesday. ""You couldn't ask for a better daughter.""

Martin ""was a bright, energetic young boy who had big dreams and high hopes for his future,"" his school said in a statement. ""We are heartbroken by this loss.""

The hunt for the attacker

The attack left Boston police with ""the most complex crime scene that we've dealt with in the history of our department,"" Commissioner Ed Davis said Tuesday.

Authorities sifted through thousands of pieces of evidence and a mass of digital photos and video clips. They have pleaded for the public's help in providing additional leads and images.

""Someone knows who did this,"" said Rick DesLauriers, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Boston office, said. ""The community will play a crucial role in this investigation.""

Medical personnel treating the wounded found evidence suggesting the bomb maker or bomb makers sought to maximize the suffering.

Dr. George Velmahos, head of trauma care at Massachusetts General Hospital, said his team found ""numerous"" metal pellets and nails inside patients' bodies.

""There are people who have 10, 20, 30, 40 of them in their body, or more,"" Velmahos said.

Dr. Ron Walls also said one patient had more than 12 carpenter-type nails.

""There is no question some of these objects were implanted in the device for the purpose of being exploded forward,"" he said.

Victims continue recovery

As investigators continued to search for a suspect, those wounded in the incident continued to recover.

Boston-area hospitals had released at least 112 of the 178 people injured in the attack, according to CNN's tally late Wednesday. Of the 66 people who were still hospitalized, 13 were in critical condition.

Boston Medical Center has two patients in critical condition, down from 11 just after the bombings, Dr. Peter Burke, chief of trauma care, told reporters Wednesday. Ten patients are in serious condition and seven are in fair condition, he said.

Spectator Steve Byrne was standing with a group of friends near a mailbox when the second blast went off. Now his face is scarred with shrapnel wounds. A BB pellet remains lodged in his neck. Doctors said they couldn't remove it because was too close to nerves that control his vision, but he was out of the hospital on Wednesday.

Compared to how his friends are suffering, he told CNN's AC360 that he feels lucky.

Four out of the five friends he was watching the marathon with have lost limbs, he said. One friend had 70 nails in his leg.

He remembers the explosion in vivid detail: the blast that was so strong that it burned his clothes off; the carnage around him; and the haunting, slow-motion daze of searching for his friends.

""We were having a great day and waiting to see our friend cross the finish line,"" he said, ""and then all of the sudden it turned in a flash.""

He told CNN he's worried about the financial burdens his friends could face as a result of the explosion.

One friend is a carpenter and ""both his hands are incinerated. He can't go to work, and the bills keep coming in.""

""It's not just the hospitals. It's everyday life that doesn't stop. ... We're just hoping the mayor, the governor, President Obama don't let us as citizens down.""

Beyond those seriously wounded, the incident affected thousands, including Candace Rispoli, who was cheering on a friend when the festive atmosphere turned into a ""terrifying hell."" She suffered minor injuries.",www.cnn.com,left,D6BbZcCIbAPNyeKS

Today's terrorism is far from what it looked like just 14 years ago in the wake of 9/11. It's dangerous and powerful in new ways, and will prove seductive for much of the world mired in poverty and anger.

What's happening? A confluence of land, money, recruiting tools and access to the West poses new dangers. Certainly, terrorists have had such advantages before, but we've never before seen them combined so powerfully or in this magnitude.

The U.S. Olympic Committee and several European countries received the threat
The warnings come amid a Russian security clampdown ahead of the Sochi games
Police are hunting suspected Islamist insurgents , including so-called black widows
Olympic officials discounted an e-mailed threat to the upcoming Winter Games in the Russian city of Sochi on Wednesday , but the reported warning raised new concerns about security at the events .
Olympic organizing committees in the United States and several European countries got an e-mailed warning of a terrorist attack against visitors to Sochi , where President Vladimir Putin 's government has mounted a massive security effort to protect the events .
`` The IOC takes security very seriously and passes on any credible information to the relevant security services , '' International Olympic Committee spokeswoman Sandrine Tonge told CNN . But the e-mail received by the national organizations `` contains no threat and appears to be a random message from a member of the public , '' she said .
At least two countries , Slovakia and Hungary , reported receiving e-mails in English that warned about threats to their citizens and Olympic athletes . The Olympic committees for Italy and Germany also confirmed that they had received the e-mail . Others said the warnings had been forwarded to them from other countries or the IOC .

The e-mail received in Hungary suggested that `` there might be a terrorist attack against nationals of Hungary and the Hungarian team , and that members of the team may be blown up , '' Zsigmond Nagy , director for international relations for Hungary 's National Olympic Committee , told CNN . Nagy said the Hungarian Olympic Committee had shared the letter with the organizers of the Sochi Winter Olympics as well as the IOC .
Hungary 's counterterrorism agency was analyzing the e-mail , but Hungary does not intend to change its plans to attend the Games in Sochi , Nagy said .
The U.S. Olympic Committee also received the message and sent it `` to the appropriate authorities , '' committee chief Scott Blackmun said .
`` The safety and security of Team USA is our top priority , '' he said in a written statement . `` As is always the case , we are working with the U.S. Department of State , the local organizers and the relevant law enforcement agencies in an effort to ensure that our delegation and other Americans traveling to Sochi are safe . ''
The warnings come as Russian authorities are clamping down on suspected Islamic militants in the region surrounding Sochi , a resort city on the Black Sea coast . Russia has been battling a low-level Islamist insurgency in the North Caucasus region for more than a decade , and militants have vowed to strike at the Olympics .
Among those hunted by Russian security forces are three women suspected of being `` black widows '' -- a group of women who have carried out high-profile suicide bombings after government forces killed their insurgent husbands .
Police have handed out fliers with the women 's names and pictures to hotels in Rostov-on-Don , a southwestern Russian town through which the Olympic Torch relay was due to pass Wednesday , and in the Sochi area .
In an interview set to air Wednesday on CNN 's `` Amanpour '' program , Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said `` there are always some threats '' to public events , `` not only this country , but also in others . ''
But Russian authorities are aware of those threats and are planning accordingly , he said .
`` I am referring to the mobilization , buildup , of police forces , and a huge number of policemen will watch the progress of the Games , '' Medvedev said .
Over the weekend , as Putin told reporters that his government has a `` perfect understanding '' of the threat and how to stop it , a video posted online warned that insurgents had `` a present '' for Olympic visitors .
U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul , chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security , told CNN 's `` New Day '' show from Moscow that there were no guarantees when it comes to safety , but the security operation in Sochi `` is the most impressive and well-fortified that we 've ever seen in Olympic history . ''
McCaul , who has been in Sochi to assess the security situation , said cooperation between U.S. and Russian security teams was good , but there was room for greater intelligence sharing .
The Russians `` have been not quite as candid with us , '' he said . `` I think we could help them a great deal if they would open up information sharing more to us . ''
FBI agents are now going to Sochi to work with their Russian counterparts on counterterrorism efforts , McCaul said .
Amid the concerns , the top U.S. military officer discussed sharing high-tech equipment to counter improvised bombs with his Russian counterpart Tuesday , a Pentagon spokesman told CNN .
The matter came up `` on an exploratory level '' in a meeting between Gen. Martin Dempsey , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and Russian Gen. Valery Gerasimov , said Col. Edward Thomas , a Dempsey spokesman .
McCaul said President Barack Obama had also spoken with Putin about the issue .
A tight security cordon is in place around Sochi , the Texas congressman said , but it 's hard to be sure that no hidden threat exists .
`` The problem is , how many of these 'black widows ' ... came into this area before the ring of steel came up ? '' he said . `` We also know that one of these black widows actually was able to penetrate the ring in the Sochi area . ''
Russia has deployed huge numbers of security officials , McCaul said , `` but it only takes one suicide bomber to get in to cause a real problem . ''
McCaul said it was likely that insurgents would carry out more bombings on softer targets outside Sochi , like those that hit a train station and trolley bus in the southern city of Volgograd at the end of last year . `` They know the eyes of the world are on these Olympics , and what better way to make a statement , '' he said .
Besides U.S. security officers deployed through the diplomatic security service , Olympic teams themselves are also hiring private security teams , he said .
`` My concern is the 10,000 to 15,000 Americans who will be at these Games and our Olympic team itself being protected from these potential suicide bombers , '' he said .
`` It 's very eerie when you go into Sochi to see the mountains and to think about these black widows , as they call them , who 've had their spouses killed by the FSB ( intelligence agency ) , now retaliating through suicide bombing . ''
However , the Olympic Village itself is `` very well fortified , '' McCaul said , and there 's an impressive show of force on the ground .
`` We are all very hopeful these will be safe and protected Games , '' he said .
The radical extremists in the region are historically more interested in targeting Russia than the United States , he added .
Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani , who 's involved in the planning for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , told `` New Day '' that it was `` too late '' to reconsider the decision to hold the Winter Olympics in Sochi .
`` When you look back on it , it 's awfully close to one of the worst situations in the world in terms of terrorism , exportation of terrorism , '' he said . But , at the same time , `` it happens to be in a country that has tremendous security . ''
Giuliani said he was familiar with the Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City , Utah , only months after the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . Those Games were almost canceled , he said , and had `` an enormous amount of security . ''
As for Sochi , Russia has `` devoted more resources to security than frankly I 've ever seen , '' Giuliani said .
`` In retrospect , could you have picked a place that 's safer ? I guess you could ... ( but ) the minute you hold the Olympics in a place , whether it 's Salt Lake City or it 's Rio de Janeiro or it 's London , you have actually brought all the world 's problems to you , '' he said .
`` So yes , Sochi is dangerous because it 's close to the Caucasus . However , the minute you have an Olympics , every one of these causes gets attracted to you and you got ta have enormous security . ''","Story highlights An e-mailed threat to national Olympic committees isn't seen as credible, IOC says

Olympic organizing committees in the United States and several European countries got an e-mailed warning of a terrorist attack against visitors to Sochi, where President Vladimir Putin's government has mounted a massive security effort to protect the events.

""The IOC takes security very seriously and passes on any credible information to the relevant security services,"" International Olympic Committee spokeswoman Sandrine Tonge told CNN. But the e-mail received by the national organizations ""contains no threat and appears to be a random message from a member of the public,"" she said.

At least two countries, Slovakia and Hungary, reported receiving e-mails in English that warned about threats to their citizens and Olympic athletes. The Olympic committees for Italy and Germany also confirmed that they had received the e-mail. Others said the warnings had been forwarded to them from other countries or the IOC.

The e-mail received in Hungary suggested that ""there might be a terrorist attack against nationals of Hungary and the Hungarian team, and that members of the team may be blown up,"" Zsigmond Nagy, director for international relations for Hungary's National Olympic Committee, told CNN. Nagy said the Hungarian Olympic Committee had shared the letter with the organizers of the Sochi Winter Olympics as well as the IOC.

Hungary's counterterrorism agency was analyzing the e-mail, but Hungary does not intend to change its plans to attend the Games in Sochi, Nagy said.

The U.S. Olympic Committee also received the message and sent it ""to the appropriate authorities,"" committee chief Scott Blackmun said.

""The safety and security of Team USA is our top priority,"" he said in a written statement. ""As is always the case, we are working with the U.S. Department of State, the local organizers and the relevant law enforcement agencies in an effort to ensure that our delegation and other Americans traveling to Sochi are safe.""

Medvedev: Huge security buildup

The warnings come as Russian authorities are clamping down on suspected Islamic militants in the region surrounding Sochi, a resort city on the Black Sea coast. Russia has been battling a low-level Islamist insurgency in the North Caucasus region for more than a decade, and militants have vowed to strike at the Olympics.

Among those hunted by Russian security forces are three women suspected of being ""black widows"" -- a group of women who have carried out high-profile suicide bombings after government forces killed their insurgent husbands.

Police have handed out fliers with the women's names and pictures to hotels in Rostov-on-Don, a southwestern Russian town through which the Olympic Torch relay was due to pass Wednesday, and in the Sochi area.

In an interview set to air Wednesday on CNN's ""Amanpour"" program, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said ""there are always some threats"" to public events, ""not only this country, but also in others.""

But Russian authorities are aware of those threats and are planning accordingly, he said.

""I am referring to the mobilization, buildup, of police forces, and a huge number of policemen will watch the progress of the Games,"" Medvedev said.

Over the weekend, as Putin told reporters that his government has a ""perfect understanding"" of the threat and how to stop it, a video posted online warned that insurgents had ""a present"" for Olympic visitors.

'Well-fortified'

U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, told CNN's ""New Day"" show from Moscow that there were no guarantees when it comes to safety, but the security operation in Sochi ""is the most impressive and well-fortified that we've ever seen in Olympic history.""

McCaul, who has been in Sochi to assess the security situation, said cooperation between U.S. and Russian security teams was good, but there was room for greater intelligence sharing.

The Russians ""have been not quite as candid with us,"" he said. ""I think we could help them a great deal if they would open up information sharing more to us.""

FBI agents are now going to Sochi to work with their Russian counterparts on counterterrorism efforts, McCaul said.

Amid the concerns, the top U.S. military officer discussed sharing high-tech equipment to counter improvised bombs with his Russian counterpart Tuesday, a Pentagon spokesman told CNN.

The matter came up ""on an exploratory level"" in a meeting between Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Russian Gen. Valery Gerasimov, said Col. Edward Thomas, a Dempsey spokesman.

McCaul said President Barack Obama had also spoken with Putin about the issue.

A tight security cordon is in place around Sochi, the Texas congressman said, but it's hard to be sure that no hidden threat exists.

""The problem is, how many of these 'black widows' ... came into this area before the ring of steel came up?"" he said. ""We also know that one of these black widows actually was able to penetrate the ring in the Sochi area.""

Russia has deployed huge numbers of security officials, McCaul said, ""but it only takes one suicide bomber to get in to cause a real problem.""

'Eyes of the world'

McCaul said it was likely that insurgents would carry out more bombings on softer targets outside Sochi, like those that hit a train station and trolley bus in the southern city of Volgograd at the end of last year. ""They know the eyes of the world are on these Olympics, and what better way to make a statement,"" he said.

Besides U.S. security officers deployed through the diplomatic security service, Olympic teams themselves are also hiring private security teams, he said.

""My concern is the 10,000 to 15,000 Americans who will be at these Games and our Olympic team itself being protected from these potential suicide bombers,"" he said.

""It's very eerie when you go into Sochi to see the mountains and to think about these black widows, as they call them, who've had their spouses killed by the FSB (intelligence agency), now retaliating through suicide bombing.""

However, the Olympic Village itself is ""very well fortified,"" McCaul said, and there's an impressive show of force on the ground.

""We are all very hopeful these will be safe and protected Games,"" he said.

The radical extremists in the region are historically more interested in targeting Russia than the United States, he added.

Giuliani: 'Tremendous security'

Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who's involved in the planning for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, told ""New Day"" that it was ""too late"" to reconsider the decision to hold the Winter Olympics in Sochi.

""When you look back on it, it's awfully close to one of the worst situations in the world in terms of terrorism, exportation of terrorism,"" he said. But, at the same time, ""it happens to be in a country that has tremendous security.""

Giuliani said he was familiar with the Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City, Utah, only months after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Those Games were almost canceled, he said, and had ""an enormous amount of security.""

As for Sochi, Russia has ""devoted more resources to security than frankly I've ever seen,"" Giuliani said.

""In retrospect, could you have picked a place that's safer? I guess you could ... (but) the minute you hold the Olympics in a place, whether it's Salt Lake City or it's Rio de Janeiro or it's London, you have actually brought all the world's problems to you,"" he said.

""So yes, Sochi is dangerous because it's close to the Caucasus. However, the minute you have an Olympics, every one of these causes gets attracted to you and you gotta have enormous security.""",www.cnn.com,left,ajUkpFLVYoasLHF0

A 49-year-old Coast Guard lieutenant charged with stockpiling weapons and drugs is being described as a `` domestic terrorist '' who was planning `` to murder innocent civilians on a scale rarely seen in this country , '' according to court documents filed in U.S. District Court in Maryland on Tuesday .
Federal prosecutors say Christopher Paul Hasson , a self-described white nationalist living in Silver Spring , Md. , was amassing firearms since at least 2017 , while cultivating plans to launch a widespread attack on prominent Democratic lawmakers , including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , and several high-profile television anchors from MSNBC and CNN .
In a detention hearing Thursday , U.S. Magistrate Judge Charles Day ordered Hasson held without bond at the prosecution 's request .
However , Day gave the government 14 days to present more serious charges against Hasson . If it fails to do so , Day said he would entertain a defense motion for release .
Hasson faces a misdemeanor drug charge and a felony weapons possession charge related to illegal drug use .
Court documents indicate Hasson espoused extremist and white supremacist views for years — aspiring to establish a `` white homeland '' — and say he is a `` domestic terrorist bent on committing acts dangerous to human life that are intended to affect government conduct . ''
`` I am dreaming of a way to kill every last person on earth , '' Hasson wrote in a draft email dated June 2 , 2017 , that was uncovered by investigators , according to the court records .

`` Much blood will have to be spilled to get whitey off the couch . ... They will die as will the traitors who actively work toward our demise , '' he wrote disdainfully .
The rambling and inchoate letter also includes a to-do list for the next four years , revealing Hasson 's desire to `` Get out of debt ! ! ! ! Buy van to convert , diesel , Buy land for family out west or possibly NC mtns . '' He also adds that he needs to `` come off '' tramadol , a narcotic painkiller . `` Clear my head , '' he says .
In recent years , the government contends , Hasson has been on a weapons buying spree , collecting 15 firearms and more than 1,000 rounds of mixed ammunition — all of which were confiscated from Hasson 's basement apartment last week .
During the raid , officials also discovered Hasson 's computer , containing a spreadsheet that reportedly is a hit list of possible targets — high-ranking current and former Democratic politicians , activists , political organizations and media personalities .
In addition to Pelosi , Hasson was allegedly considering some type of violent assault on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , Sens . Elizabeth Warren , Kamala Harris , Kirsten Gillibrand and Richard Blumenthal , along with U.S. Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Maxine Waters and former House member , Beto O'Rourke . The spreadsheet list also included MSNBC hosts Chris Hayes and Joe Scarborough , as well as Don Lemon and Van Jones from CNN .
The court filings paint a picture of an angry and drugged man who has been seeking answers in neo-fascist and neo-Nazi literature for decades and who is desperate to make a `` lasting impression on this world . ''
Apparently , Hasson frequently sought instruction from a manifesto written by Anders Breivik , a far-right , anti-Muslim Norwegian nationalist who was convicted in 2012 of two terror attacks that killed 77 people . According to officials , Hasson used Breivik 's methods to hone his list of potential victims , conducting Internet searches for `` most liberal senators '' , `` where do most senators live in dc '' and `` are supreme court justices protected . ''
Hasson 's drug use also appears to stem from directions in Breivik 's manifesto , `` taking narcotics in order to increase his ability to conduct attacks . ''

A 49-year-old Coast Guard lieutenant charged with stockpiling weapons and drugs is being described as a ""domestic terrorist"" who was planning ""to murder innocent civilians on a scale rarely seen in this country,"" according to court documents filed in U.S. District Court in Maryland on Tuesday.

terrorism,International Business Times,1,http://www.ibtimes.com/boston-marathon-bombings-deadly-legacy-anwar-al-awlaki-1235463,Boston Marathon Bombings: The Deadly Legacy Of Anwar Al-Awlaki,2013-05-03,,"An FBI investigation into the activities of Dzohkar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev , the two young Chechen men who perpetrated the April 15 bombings at the Boston Marathon that killed three people and injured more than 260 , were partially influenced by Anwar al-Awlaki , a radical American-born Muslim cleric who later moved to Yemen .
The New York Times reported that Dzokhar , 19 , the surviving Tsarnaev brother , told law enforcement officials that they were inspired by Internet sermons delivered by Awlaki , who was killed by U.S. drones September 2011 . However , it is unclear if the Tsarnaevs had any direct contact with Awlaki during their path toward radicalism .
( Tamerlan was shot to death by police in an intense gunfight soon after the Boston bombings . )
Dkzohar also told FBI investigators that he and his brother wanted to strike American targets in retaliation for the U.S. military ’ s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . But he also insisted that he and his brother were not part of a wider terror network and operated alone .
Aside from Awlaki ’ s fiery sermons , Dzokhar told FBI officials that he and his brother learned how to construct pressure-cooker bombs from an online magazine called Inspire , published by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula . The man believed to be behind Inspire , a U.S. citizen named Samir Khan , was killed in the same drone stroke that ended the life of Awlaki in the fall of 2011 .
Awlaki , who was born in New Mexico to Yemeni parents , eventually rose to become a senior operative in the Yemeni branch of al Qaeda . His death sparked some controversy for the Barack Obama administration given that U.S. military drones were being used to kill American citizens ( apparently for the first time in history ) .
Awlaki first came to the FBI ’ s attention as long ago as 1999 due to his association with known Muslim militants . In the wake of the 9/11 attacks , he was questioned by the FBI over his association with some of the hijackers who plowed an aircraft into the World Trade Center , killing thousands .
Awlaki allegedly came into contact with the 9/11 hijackers while serving as an imam at a mosque in Falls Church , Va .
Awlaki departed the U.S. for good in 2002 ending up in Yemen in 2004 , where he was jailed for 18 months in connection with an alleged al Qaeda plot to kidnap a U.S. military attaché , as well as a Shiite teenager . Awlaki ’ s detention was reportedly encouraged by U.S. authorities who put pressure on their Yemeni allies at the time .
Awlaki was released from prison , apparently due to intervention by members of his tribe , but it is not clear if the U.S. approved his freedom or not .
Thereafter , the firebrand preacher showed up on the Internet , exhorting young Muslims around the world , including in the West , to fight the U.S. , which he claimed was at “ war with Islam . '' Many of his sermons appeared on YouTube ( since removed ) , and he even had his own blog and Facebook page .
It was later revealed that Major Nidal Malik Hasan , the army psychiatrist who killed 13 people in Fort Hood , Texas , in November 2009 , had been exchanging emails with Awlaki .
“ Nidal Hassan is a hero , ” Awlaki wrote on his blog . “ He is a man of conscience who could not bear living the contradiction of being a Muslim and serving in an army that is fighting against his own people . ”
Thereafter , U.S. intelligence intensified its efforts to find Awlaki ( though , ironically , as a U.S. citizen , his inflammatory words were still protected by the First Amendment ) .
In December 2009 , after Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , a young Nigerian man , attempted and failed to destroy an airliner approaching the Detroit airport , he confessed to FBI agents that he had met with Awlaki in Yemen and discussed “ martyrdom and jihad ” with him . He also claimed Awlaki directed him to perform the bombing .
“ [ Awlaki ] had been on the radar all along , but it was Abdulmutallab ’ s testimony that really sealed it in my mind that this guy was dangerous and that we needed to go after him , ” Dennis C. Blair , then director of national intelligence , told the New York Times .
In the months following the drone strikes that killed Awlaki , his 16-year-old son and Khan , their relatives in the U.S. filed lawsuits against the Pentagon and CIA , again raising the legal quandary of the U.S. military killing American citizens .
“ The killings violated fundamental rights afforded to all U.S. citizens , including the right not to be deprived of life without due process of law , '' the legal complaint stated .
In a book titled “ Dirty Wars : The World Is a Battlefield ” by investigative journalist Jeremy Scahill , which detailed the targeted assassination of Awlaki , President Obama was apparently upset by the accidental death of Awlaki ’ s teenage son , Abdurrahman . However , the New York Daily News reported that Obama had authorized the killing of the elder Awlaki as early as February 2010 under the clause that Awlaki presented an imminent threat to the U.S .","An FBI investigation into the activities of Dzohkar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the two young Chechen men who perpetrated the April 15 bombings at the Boston Marathon that killed three people and injured more than 260, were partially influenced by Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical American-born Muslim cleric who later moved to Yemen.

The New York Times reported that Dzokhar, 19, the surviving Tsarnaev brother, told law enforcement officials that they were inspired by Internet sermons delivered by Awlaki, who was killed by U.S. drones September 2011. However, it is unclear if the Tsarnaevs had any direct contact with Awlaki during their path toward radicalism.

(Tamerlan was shot to death by police in an intense gunfight soon after the Boston bombings.)

Dkzohar also told FBI investigators that he and his brother wanted to strike American targets in retaliation for the U.S. military’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But he also insisted that he and his brother were not part of a wider terror network and operated alone.

Aside from Awlaki’s fiery sermons, Dzokhar told FBI officials that he and his brother learned how to construct pressure-cooker bombs from an online magazine called Inspire, published by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The man believed to be behind Inspire, a U.S. citizen named Samir Khan, was killed in the same drone stroke that ended the life of Awlaki in the fall of 2011.

Awlaki, who was born in New Mexico to Yemeni parents, eventually rose to become a senior operative in the Yemeni branch of al Qaeda. His death sparked some controversy for the Barack Obama administration given that U.S. military drones were being used to kill American citizens (apparently for the first time in history).

Awlaki first came to the FBI’s attention as long ago as 1999 due to his association with known Muslim militants. In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, he was questioned by the FBI over his association with some of the hijackers who plowed an aircraft into the World Trade Center, killing thousands.

Awlaki allegedly came into contact with the 9/11 hijackers while serving as an imam at a mosque in Falls Church, Va.

Awlaki departed the U.S. for good in 2002 ending up in Yemen in 2004, where he was jailed for 18 months in connection with an alleged al Qaeda plot to kidnap a U.S. military attaché, as well as a Shiite teenager. Awlaki’s detention was reportedly encouraged by U.S. authorities who put pressure on their Yemeni allies at the time.

Awlaki was released from prison, apparently due to intervention by members of his tribe, but it is not clear if the U.S. approved his freedom or not.

Thereafter, the firebrand preacher showed up on the Internet, exhorting young Muslims around the world, including in the West, to fight the U.S., which he claimed was at “war with Islam."" Many of his sermons appeared on YouTube (since removed), and he even had his own blog and Facebook page.

It was later revealed that Major Nidal Malik Hasan, the army psychiatrist who killed 13 people in Fort Hood, Texas, in November 2009, had been exchanging emails with Awlaki.

“Nidal Hassan is a hero,” Awlaki wrote on his blog. “He is a man of conscience who could not bear living the contradiction of being a Muslim and serving in an army that is fighting against his own people.”

Thereafter, U.S. intelligence intensified its efforts to find Awlaki (though, ironically, as a U.S. citizen, his inflammatory words were still protected by the First Amendment).

Meanwhile, Awlaki's notoriety simply grew.

In December 2009, after Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a young Nigerian man, attempted and failed to destroy an airliner approaching the Detroit airport, he confessed to FBI agents that he had met with Awlaki in Yemen and discussed “martyrdom and jihad” with him. He also claimed Awlaki directed him to perform the bombing.

“[Awlaki] had been on the radar all along, but it was Abdulmutallab’s testimony that really sealed it in my mind that this guy was dangerous and that we needed to go after him,” Dennis C. Blair, then director of national intelligence, told the New York Times.

terrorism,Vox,0,http://www.vox.com/2015/2/25/8101383/iran-nuclear-reasons,The 4 real reasons Iran is so committed to its nuclear program,2015-02-25,"Max Fisher, Shirin Ghaffary, Peter Kafka, Rebecca Heilweil, Aja Romano, Allegra Frank, Jen Kirby","As the deadlines near for Iran and world powers to reach an agreement on the country 's nuclear program — the first , on March 31 , for a basic political framework — negotiations are focusing on what kind of program Iran can have . How much uranium and plutonium can it have ? How many centrifuges can it use to develop more fuel ? How long will restrictions be in place ?
There 's one fact , though , that is taken as assumed : Iran very badly wants a nuclear program . So badly that it has been willing to press ahead with the program , secretly as well as overtly , despite Western and UN sanctions that have crippled its economy , and despite repeated US warnings of possible military action .
Iran claims its program is entirely peaceful , but there are major reasons to doubt this , and it is generally taken as a given by analysts that the country has at least taken just-in-case steps partway toward building a bomb . Some facilities seem to serve little plausible function beyond nuclear weapons capability , though a point that Western intelligence agencies have made in the past is that building the capacity for making a bomb is not the same as deciding to make a bomb .
Whatever Iran 's intentions , though , the country 's dedication to nuclear enrichment even at such enormous costs can seem bizarrely counterproductive . So why is Iran so set on its nuclear program ? There is no one dominant answer , but rather a few plausible explanations , some of which go against the most common Western perceptions and misperceptions of how Iran works . There is probably some truth to all of them .
1 ) Iran wants to defend against external threats it earnestly fears
Consider Tehran 's view for a moment : Israeli and American leaders have been talking for years about bombing Iran or invading it outright . The Bush administration named Iran part of its `` axis of evil , '' alongside Iraq , which it invaded months later . For much of the last decade , the US has had thousands of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan , both Iran 's neighbors .
Iranian leaders appear to sincerely believe that the United States is bent on their government 's destruction . For example , the United States helped Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in his brutal , years-long war against Iran , in which he killed thousands of Iranians , including with chemical weapons . It is difficult to overstate how traumatic the years-long war was for Iranians , how badly they want to prevent another such war . And nothing deters chemical weapon attacks like a nuclear weapon .
You will hear Iranians frequently mention Iran Air flight 655 , a civilian airliner that the US military accidentally shot down in 1988 , killing 290 civilians . In Iran , this is still frequently viewed as deliberate . Imagine you 're an Iranian leader seeing all this . You might want a nuclear deterrent .
Also consider the timing of the program . When the ayatollahs came to power in the 1979 Islamic revolution , they at first cancelled the country 's nuclear program , but then re-started it after Saddam invaded in 1980 .
`` Tehran wanted to guard against a future surprise analogous to Iraq 's repeated use of chemical weapons , '' writes Shahram Chubin of the Carnegie Endowment . More recently , Iran has been embroiled in low-level proxy conflicts with Israel and Saudi Arabia , and with what it sees as a defensive conflict against the hostile West .
It 's important to remember that Iran sees itself as isolated in the world , despite intimations of occasional Russian or Chinese support . Save for proxies such as Hezbollah and the Syrian government , it sees the Middle East as largely aligned against it . It is also important to remember that its leaders , in power only since 1979 , feel weak and isolated . Current Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in particular has never been very confident in power .
That sense of insecurity feeds into a rational desire for deterrence against external threats , but it also creates a less rational belief in anti-Iran conspiracies or an impending American invasion . When the US threatens to bomb Iran to stop a nuclear program , Iranian leaders can misread this as a desire to destroy the Iranian state itself , which would make them more likely to want a nuclear deterrent , which only makes the US threaten more strenuously .
Iran 's national pride runs deep , and with good reason : It has been an active center of cultural , scientific , religious and political thought for many centuries . It 's also still upset , again with reason , about decades of Western interference during the 19th and 20th centuries .
The nuclear program is a way in which Iran affirms , to itself and to the world , that it is an advanced and sovereign nation . It 's a way of saying : we are not inferior to the world powers , even though you treat us that way , but are in fact equals .
It 's also a way of defying what Iran sees as continued Western efforts to control , exploit or weaken Iran . The more that the world tells Iran it can not have a nuclear program , the more important building such a program becomes for the cause of Iranian nationalism .
This is part of why Iranian leaders so often state that they want world powers to affirm Iran 's right to enrich uranium and to respect Iran 's `` dignity '' — a word that top officials use frequently . This is n't posturing — they really mean it .
In November 2013 , as nuclear talks got underway , Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif released a video articulating Iran 's position . He spent very little time talking about actual nuclear policies — the meat and potatoes of the negotiations — and lots of time saying things like , `` We expect and demand respect for our dignity . '' He frequently mentioned phrases such as `` equal footing '' and `` mutual respect . '' The video was taken as bizarre and inexplicable by Americans , because they could not see that this demand for respect was not a side issue — it was central for Iran .
3 ) The nuclear program has become a big issue in Iranian domestic politics
There was a brief moment , after the US invasions of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003 ( both Iran 's neighbors ) where Tehran seemed eager to strike a deal with the West over its nuclear program . There are many reasons that fell apart — Dick Cheney personally worked to torpedo any communications , for example — but a crucial one was Iranian politics .
Iran 's anti-US hard-liners took the parliament in 2004 , and the presidency in 2005 with the election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . The hard-liners turned the nuclear program into something of a partisan wedge issue , using it to weaken reformers and moderates who wanted to compromise the program to soften relations with the West .
`` Both Ahmadinejad and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei used the nuclear issue to stigmatize reformists , depicting them as defeatists willing to negotiate away Iran 's interests , '' Chubin writes . `` Their use of the nuclear issue as an instrument of partisan politics ended the phase when the nuclear program was supposed to be a national issue . And debate was actively discouraged . ''
This was great politics for Ahmadinejad and other hard-liners . But it made it much more difficult for him or other Iranian leaders to compromise on the program . They were too invested in the program , politically , to back down — even if backing down would have been in Iran 's national interests .
`` By 2010 , '' Chubin writes , `` the divide over Iran 's nuclear program had more to do with domestic politics-and very little to do with what many of the key players actually wanted to see happen . ''
Ahmadinejad is out of power , but the hard-liners are still powerful . They have particular influence over Khamenei , who as supreme leader is the ultimate decision-maker . Because of the way Khamenei came to power — his religious credentials are weak , and his political credibility never as strong as predecessor and national founder Ruhollah Khomeini — he 's long caved to hard-liners , who he fears could turn against him .
4 ) Iran sees itself as in a struggle for influence in the region — a nuke would help a lot
Since Iran become the Islamic Republic in the 1979 revolution , it has seen the Middle East as a battleground for its influence . This is meant as both defensive and offensive ; ever since Saddam invaded , Iranian leaders have feared that hostile , Western-backed Arab leaders could do them terrible harm . And Tehran sees pro-American Sunni powers such as Saudi Arabia as inherently hostile .
But Iran is also expansive and aggressive in the region , supporting proxy terror groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah both as a deterrent against American or Israeli threats and as a way to project its power . In the context of this regional struggle for power , a nuclear weapon starts to make a lot more sense . Not as something that Tehran would want to actually use , but as a way to get away with other sorts of trouble-making .
Clifton W. Sherrill of Troy University explained in a 2012 issue of Nonproliferation Review how Iran could use a nuclear weapon as not just a deterrent but a way to give itself cover for bullying its neighbors and generally projecting more power in the region , where competition for influence is already high , and the stakes are enormous .
`` The regime believes nuclear weapons would deter foreign military strikes targeting the Iranian homeland , making the Iranian use of conventional military force abroad less risky , '' Sherrill writes . `` At a minimum , possession of nuclear arms would allow Iran greater policy flexibility in the Middle East . ''
That likely means using proxy groups , such as Hezbollah in Lebanon , even more aggressively to threaten and bully other countries in the region . That also means pushing harder to support pro-Iran militant groups in countries such as Syria and Yemen where Iran sees itself as competing for influence . The idea is that Iran can be more brazen and aggressive with these non-nuclear threats because its nuclear weapon would scare other countries out of retaliating .
That bullying could also have implications for energy politics ; Iran might feel it could force `` demands in the Persian Gulf regarding disputed islands or natural gas fields '' or `` desires regarding production quotas '' within OPEC , Sherrill warns . And he points to nuclear-armed Pakistan as an example of how this all can happen :
Pakistan 's behavior after its public entry into the nuclear club in 1998 is instructive : it immediately increased support for Islamist militants , creating 1999 's Kargil crisis and the standoff with India in 2000 and 2001 . In a classic example of the stability-instability paradox , Pakistani confidence that nuclear arms would prevent escalation made limited conventional and terrorist attacks against India possible .
Iran does not want a bomb to launch an offensive strike against another country
Despite widespread misconceptions to the contrary in the US — often pushed by politicians who wish to play up the Iranian threat for political gain — there is no reason to believe that Iran wants to launch an offensive nuclear strike against the US , Israel , or any other country .
The well-established logic of nukes would make any war against other nuclear powers a loser for Iran . This is because powers such as the US and Israel have what is called second-strike capability , meaning that even if Iran got off a nuclear strike , the country would still be destroyed by the retaliation . There is no cost-benefit calculation by which an offensive strike would make sense for Iran .
As Sherrill explained , `` It is highly unlikely that the Islamist regime plans to actually detonate a nuclear weapon in an offensive attack . Both of the obvious targets , the United States and Israel , have a second-strike nuclear arsenal capable of threatening the Islamist regime 's survival . ''
Some argue that Iran 's leaders are inherently irrational because of their religion and would be willing to launch a suicidal war against the US or Israel . As Newt Gingrich once put it , for example , `` It 's impossible to deter them . What are you going to threaten ? ''
The seemingly sole piece of evidence that Iran 's leaders have spent the last 36 years secretly plotting a suicidal war is the idea that their interpretation of Shia Islam foretells of a messiah who will return on the apocalypse . While Ahmadinejad did reference this idea many times , he was alone in this , as Matt Duss of the Foundation for Middle East Peace explains , and was widely rebuked by Shia scholars and his own country 's political and clerical establishments .
Actual readings of Iran 's official Shia theology by actual religious scholars , Duss finds , reach the opposite conclusion that Newt Gingrich did : Iranian leaders see it as their religious duty to preserve their system , not destroy it in a fiery war with Israel . As scholar Mehdi Khalaji told Duss , `` As the theory of the guardianship of the jurist requires , the most significant task of the Supreme Leader is to safeguard the regime , even by overruling Islamic law . ''
Meanwhile , there is ample evidence that Iranian leaders are just as rationally invested in self-preservation as anyone else . You ca n't hold up a political system as complex and besieged as Iran 's without being shrewdly self-interested . If Iran 's Islamic regime were really looking for a suicidal war in which to martyr itself , the eight-year war with Iraq offered many such opportunities , none of which they took .
There are a number of reasons that Iran wants a nuclear program and has taken steps toward a nuclear bomb . Some of those reasons are rational and others are not . But a desire to launch an offensive strike against another country is not one of them .","As the deadlines near for Iran and world powers to reach an agreement on the country's nuclear program — the first, on March 31, for a basic political framework — negotiations are focusing on what kind of program Iran can have.

2) Nuclear enrichment has symbolic importance for Iran

Iran's national pride runs deep, and with good reason: It has been an active center of cultural, scientific, religious and political thought for many centuries. It's also still upset, again with reason, about decades of Western interference during the 19th and 20th centuries.

The man, identified as Anis A., was born in the Tunisian city of Tataouine in 1992. A refugee, he applied for asylum in Germany in April, according to Suddeutsche Zeitung.

Identity documents left behind in the truck are the primary leads in the investigation. Another suspect was arrested early Wednesday morning but was quickly released. (RELATED: ISIS Officially Claims Responsibility For Berlin Christmas Market Terror Attack)

Die Welt reports the man uses several different identities and also goes by Ahmed A. He lives in Berlin but spends a lot of his time in the western state of North Reine Westphalia, where police are taking “imminent measures.” He is known by police from being part of Salafist circles in Germany.

Police originally detained a Pakistani man named Naved B. He was released Tuesday after no forensic evidence tied him to the attack.

''
Police believe 22-year-old Salman Abedi was given the explosive he used to kill himself and 22 others at a concert by pop singer Ariana Grande . A fifth suspect was arrested Wednesday , with four in custody already in connection with the incident . Police are assessing a `` package '' the fifth suspect was carrying .
British authorities continued to conduct `` extensive '' searches while investigating the `` network '' behind the attack .
`` It is very clear that it is a network we are investigating , '' Manchester police said on Wednesday .
British officials said they deployed nearly 1,000 military troops at high-profile sites in the country , some in London , instead of police . Manchester police said the increase in threat level gave the green light to deploy military support operation under the code name `` Temperer . ''
Multiple law enforcement agencies swept through Manchester in a bid to head off a follow-up to the ghastly attack . Manchester police said they will continue doing `` extensive '' searches to disband the `` network '' of suspects . Officials also raised the number of wounded Wednesday to 119 .
Soldiers were replacing armed police on Wednesday at sites like Buckingham Palace , 10 Downing Street and Parliament . London Police Commander Jane Connors said the goal was to `` make our city as hostile an environment as possible for terrorists to plan and operate . '' She said police also would be ready to respond quickly to any incidents with armed officers , and have added more armed police walking patrols .
The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack , calling Abedi a `` soldier of the caliphate . '' Abedi was believed to have traveled to Syria and had `` proven '' links with ISIS , French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said Wednesday on BFM television , adding that British and French intelligence have information that Abedi had been to Syria . He did not provide details , and said it was unclear whether Abedi was part of a larger network of attackers .
Abedi 's father told The Associated Press that his son was in Libya a month-and-a-half ago and was preparing to visit Saudi Arabia . Living in Tripoli , Ramadan Abedi said that his family `` are n't the ones who blow up ourselves among innocents . ''
In addition to the three arrests in the south of Manchester , police also handcuffed a man at a house just a 10-minute walk from Abedi 's home -- but they did not immediately confirm it was connected to the concert bombing . `` There was a policeman , armed policeman , shouting at my neighbor ... and I realized there is something wrong here ... they arrested the father , and I think the rest of the family kind of disappeared , '' neighbor Omar Alfa Khuri said , adding that he knew the arrested man from the local mosque .
Abedi had been known to security forces `` up to a point , '' Home Secretary Amber Rudd said .
Prime Minister Theresa May Wednesday chaired a meeting of her emergency security cabinet group , known as COBRA , to review intelligence reports about Abedi and concerns that he might have had outside support .
Britain raised its threat level to `` critical , '' which May said means an attack could come at any time . `` This means that the assessment is that , not only is a further attack likely , but that it could be imminent . ''
Police raided Abedi 's house earlier , using a controlled explosion to blast down the door . Neighbors recalled him as a tall , thin young man who often wore traditional Islamic dress and did not talk much .
Police also raided and searched a property elsewhere in Manchester where Abedi 's brother Ismail is thought to have lived . A 23-year-old man has also been arrested as part of the investigation but officials have released no details about him .
British soldiers have been deployed in place of police officers to guard high-profile sites such as Buckingham Palace and Parliament .
Abedi was born in Britain to a Libyan family , grew up in Manchester 's southern suburbs and attended the local Salford University for a time .
Officials are looking into how often Abedi had traveled to Libya , which has seen an eruption of armed Islamist groups since dictator Moammar Qaddafi was overthrown and killed in 2011 . British officials have not commented on whether Abedi had links to ISIS or other extremist groups .
In addition to those killed in the concert attack , 64 people are being treated for their wounds , Jon Rouse of the Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership said Wednesday .
He said some of the wounded had been discharged , but that the number of patients being treated had increased due to `` walking wounded '' who came in hours after the attack . Rouse said many of those hospitalized had serious wounds that would require `` very long term care and support in terms of their recovery . ''
Collomb , who spoke with May after the attack , said the two countries should continue cooperating closely on counterterrorism efforts despite Britain 's pending exit from the European Union .","British authorities were in a frantic race to find the mastermind who fashioned the deadly bomb used in Monday's terror attack in Manchester, as the nation was braced for a new strike that could be ""imminent.""

In addition to the three arrests in the south of Manchester, police also handcuffed a man at a house just a 10-minute walk from Abedi's home -- but they did not immediately confirm it was connected to the concert bombing. ""There was a policeman, armed policeman, shouting at my neighbor ... and I realized there is something wrong here ... they arrested the father, and I think the rest of the family kind of disappeared,"" neighbor Omar Alfa Khuri said, adding that he knew the arrested man from the local mosque.

Abedi had been known to security forces ""up to a point,"" Home Secretary Amber Rudd said.

Prime Minister Theresa May Wednesday chaired a meeting of her emergency security cabinet group, known as COBRA, to review intelligence reports about Abedi and concerns that he might have had outside support.

Britain raised its threat level to ""critical,"" which May said means an attack could come at any time. ""This means that the assessment is that, not only is a further attack likely, but that it could be imminent.""

DOZENS STILL HOSPITALIZED AFTER ATTACK

Police raided Abedi's house earlier, using a controlled explosion to blast down the door. Neighbors recalled him as a tall, thin young man who often wore traditional Islamic dress and did not talk much.

Police also raided and searched a property elsewhere in Manchester where Abedi's brother Ismail is thought to have lived. A 23-year-old man has also been arrested as part of the investigation but officials have released no details about him.

British soldiers have been deployed in place of police officers to guard high-profile sites such as Buckingham Palace and Parliament.

Abedi was born in Britain to a Libyan family, grew up in Manchester's southern suburbs and attended the local Salford University for a time.

Officials are looking into how often Abedi had traveled to Libya, which has seen an eruption of armed Islamist groups since dictator Moammar Qaddafi was overthrown and killed in 2011. British officials have not commented on whether Abedi had links to ISIS or other extremist groups.

In addition to those killed in the concert attack, 64 people are being treated for their wounds, Jon Rouse of the Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership said Wednesday.

He said some of the wounded had been discharged, but that the number of patients being treated had increased due to ""walking wounded"" who came in hours after the attack. Rouse said many of those hospitalized had serious wounds that would require ""very long term care and support in terms of their recovery.""

Collomb, who spoke with May after the attack, said the two countries should continue cooperating closely on counterterrorism efforts despite Britain's pending exit from the European Union.",www.foxnews.com,right,4YVBv5o4863yO3Ll

But it could easily fall apart.,2019-01-28,"Alex Ward, Nicole Narea, German Lopez, Brian Resnick, Aaron Rupar","America ’ s nearly two-decade war in Afghanistan may finally be drawing to a close .
After six days of negotiations in Qatar last week , the United States and the Taliban , the country ’ s Islamic insurgent group , have reportedly agreed on the outline of a long-sought deal which would allow US and foreign troops to leave the country , perhaps within 18 months .
If true , this would officially kickstart the end to Washington ’ s involvement in Afghanistan , and likely hand much of the country back to the Taliban — a group which has outlasted the efforts of three US presidents to destroy it .
On Monday , the Trump administration ’ s envoy for the peace talks , Zalmay Khalilzad , told the New York Times that “ [ w ] e have a draft of the framework that has to be fleshed out before it becomes an agreement . ”
That framework as it stands now looks like this : The Taliban , which controlled Afghanistan and harbored al-Qaeda prior to the September 11 attacks , would promise never to allow a terrorist organization to operate in the country again . In return , at least some US troops would leave the country after the Taliban agrees to a ceasefire and engages in talks with the Afghan government .
That ’ s a potential problem : The Taliban has for years refused to engage with Kabul , but also hinted that it might do so only after foreign troops leave the country .
Asked about Khalilzad ’ s comments to the Times and other similar reports , a State Department spokesperson told me that “ [ w ] hile discussions were positive , the talks concluded without an agreement . ”
“ Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed , ” the spokesperson added .
Still , some experts I spoke with called the tentative outline a “ breakthrough ” and “ tremendously good news ” — and it is , to a certain extent . It ’ s the first , and possibly best , chance for the US to establish a semblance of peace between the US-backed government in Kabul and the Taliban so American troops can come home .
But major concerns remain , experts tell me . Namely , it ’ s unclear that the Taliban would actually adhere to such an agreement . Most signs indicate the insurgents are winning the war ; the Taliban has taken much of the country ’ s territory back from Afghan control , and has recently pulled off attacks that kill hundreds of Afghans and even American service members . That ’ s led some to say the diplomatic effort is really a cover so the US can withdraw its forces — a priority for President Donald Trump — while avoiding embarrassment .
What both champions and critics of the US-Taliban talks told me , though , is that there ’ s still a long way to go before a final deal is within reach . “ There ’ s at least five or six moving pieces here , ” Jason Campbell , who led the Pentagon ’ s Afghanistan peace talk efforts from June 2016 to September 2018 and now at the RAND Corporation , told me . “ If one goes wrong , you ’ re back to square one . ”
Why a US-Taliban deal in Afghanistan is so hard to strike
To understand why US-Taliban talks aren ’ t easy , you need to understand the recent history .
The Taliban took control of Afghanistan in the early 1990s , and by 1998 controlled around 90 percent of the country . The group imposed its strict interpretation of Islamic law on the country : men had to grow long beards , women were forced to cover themselves completely , and people were prohibited from watching movies or listening to music . Punishments for various crimes sometimes included public executions or amputations .
After September 11 , 2001 , the US started paying closer attention to the group . US officials suspected the Taliban of harboring Osama bin Laden , who orchestrated the 9/11 attack , and his terrorist group , al-Qaeda . Less than a month after the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon , the US invaded Afghanistan to defeat al-Qaeda and remove the Taliban from power .
The Taliban quickly lost control of Afghanistan and retreated into neighboring Pakistan , where it has since regrouped . Now , over 17 years later , the Taliban is the most formidable insurgency fighting the United States and the Afghan government — and it doesn ’ t look like its more than 60,000 fighters are going anywhere any time soon .
That ’ s because the Taliban is actually winning the war against the Afghan military , which is backed by roughly 14,000 American troops in the country . Two charts from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction , the US military ’ s Afghanistan war watchdog , make this clear .
The first chart shows that the Taliban and other insurgent groups now control more populated areas than they did in August 2016 . The second shows that insurgent groups control even more districts in Afghanistan than they did in January 2016 , and their influence is growing .
This has made it hard for the US to reach some kind of peace deal with the Taliban despite nine years of trying ( the Trump administration tried again in earnest as recently as last August . ) Basically , the Taliban doesn ’ t seem to want to make concessions because it currently has the upper hand in the war .
That ’ s given the US less power to compel the insurgents to speak with the Afghan government , which the Taliban derides as an American puppet with little control outside the capital . The Trump administration says the only way for the war truly to end requires the Taliban and the government in Kabul to negotiate a peace deal .
Afghan President Ashraf Ghani , for his part , has repeatedly expressed a desire for Taliban talks . He reiterated that stance in a Monday address after receiving a briefing from Khalilzad on last week ’ s negotiations . But Ghani doesn ’ t want to rush discussions , he noted , saying that a bad deal could lead to bloodshed in the future and make life worse for the people of Afghanistan — particularly the women and minorities who suffered greatly under Taliban rule .
It would still be a major sign of progress if the Taliban ultimately agreed to meet with the Afghan government . The problem is that the most difficult part — ironing out the specifics of an Afghanistan-Taliban deal — would come next .
Why a deal between the Taliban and the Afghan government is so hard to strike
Experts I spoke to noted a variety of potential problems that could impede an Afghanistan-Taliban deal , and all of them said such a deal could take months to years to make . The issues break down into roughly two categories : how much power the Taliban gets to have , and what America ’ s future role will be .
In the short term , this is likely the biggest sticking point .
The Taliban wants to govern the country again like it did prior to the US-led invasion in 2001 . It therefore aims to obtain as much power as it possibly can in any potential deal .
Some ways it could do that might include taking control of certain government ministries , or even rewriting parts of the country ’ s Constitution to align more favorably with its conservative Islamist ideology . The Taliban may also push for a deal whereby the government controls the capital and other populous areas while the Taliban takes over parts of the country ’ s east and south — areas it controlled even at the height of the war .
Finally , and controversially , Taliban fighters could even integrate into the Afghan military . That ’ d be hard to swallow for many , as the group has killed thousands of Afghans and Americans . It ’ s unclear if the US would continue to fund or support Afghan forces if Taliban militants join their ranks .
Either of those possibilities would give the Taliban way more authority over the state than it has now .
One idea Ghani , the Afghan president , and the Taliban have already rejected is to form an interim government , where the insurgent group ’ s leaders would temporarily join the administration and allow talks to continue . The Trump administration and Ghani , though , say elections are the only way to have a democratic and representative government in Kabul .
Ironically , a vote could complicate the talks . Afghanistan will hold a presidential election in July , and as of now there ’ s no clear front-runner . No candidate , especially Ghani , will want to look like they will make any concessions to the Taliban . That means it ’ s less likely the government and the militants can find a mutually agreeable arrangement before then .
The insurgents don ’ t have a candidate in the election , in part because they know they can ’ t win . “ The Taliban represent a small fraction of the Afghan population , ” Frances Brown , an Afghanistan expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , told me . “ Afghan society in 2019 looks very different from Afghanistan in the 1990s . ”
But all of the talks assume one thing : that the security situation in the country remains about where it is — and that depends heavily on US involvement .
Trump has made no secret of his desire to remove US troops from Afghanistan .

After six days of negotiations in Qatar last week, the United States and the Taliban, the country’s Islamic insurgent group, have reportedly agreed on the outline of a long-sought deal which would allow US and foreign troops to leave the country, perhaps within 18 months.

If true, this would officially kickstart the end to Washington’s involvement in Afghanistan, and likely hand much of the country back to the Taliban — a group which has outlasted the efforts of three US presidents to destroy it.

On Monday, the Trump administration’s envoy for the peace talks, Zalmay Khalilzad, told the New York Times that “[w]e have a draft of the framework that has to be fleshed out before it becomes an agreement.”

That framework as it stands now looks like this: The Taliban, which controlled Afghanistan and harbored al-Qaeda prior to the September 11 attacks, would promise never to allow a terrorist organization to operate in the country again. In return, at least some US troops would leave the country after the Taliban agrees to a ceasefire and engages in talks with the Afghan government.

That’s a potential problem: The Taliban has for years refused to engage with Kabul, but also hinted that it might do so only after foreign troops leave the country.

Asked about Khalilzad’s comments to the Times and other similar reports, a State Department spokesperson told me that “[w]hile discussions were positive, the talks concluded without an agreement.”

“Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,” the spokesperson added.

Still, some experts I spoke with called the tentative outline a “breakthrough” and “tremendously good news” — and it is, to a certain extent. It’s the first, and possibly best, chance for the US to establish a semblance of peace between the US-backed government in Kabul and the Taliban so American troops can come home.

But major concerns remain, experts tell me. Namely, it’s unclear that the Taliban would actually adhere to such an agreement. Most signs indicate the insurgents are winning the war; the Taliban has taken much of the country’s territory back from Afghan control, and has recently pulled off attacks that kill hundreds of Afghans and even American service members. That’s led some to say the diplomatic effort is really a cover so the US can withdraw its forces — a priority for President Donald Trump — while avoiding embarrassment.

What both champions and critics of the US-Taliban talks told me, though, is that there’s still a long way to go before a final deal is within reach. “There’s at least five or six moving pieces here,” Jason Campbell, who led the Pentagon’s Afghanistan peace talk efforts from June 2016 to September 2018 and now at the RAND Corporation, told me. “If one goes wrong, you’re back to square one.”

Why a US-Taliban deal in Afghanistan is so hard to strike

To understand why US-Taliban talks aren’t easy, you need to understand the recent history.

The Taliban took control of Afghanistan in the early 1990s, and by 1998 controlled around 90 percent of the country. The group imposed its strict interpretation of Islamic law on the country: men had to grow long beards, women were forced to cover themselves completely, and people were prohibited from watching movies or listening to music. Punishments for various crimes sometimes included public executions or amputations.

After September 11, 2001, the US started paying closer attention to the group. US officials suspected the Taliban of harboring Osama bin Laden, who orchestrated the 9/11 attack, and his terrorist group, al-Qaeda. Less than a month after the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, the US invaded Afghanistan to defeat al-Qaeda and remove the Taliban from power.

The Taliban quickly lost control of Afghanistan and retreated into neighboring Pakistan, where it has since regrouped. Now, over 17 years later, the Taliban is the most formidable insurgency fighting the United States and the Afghan government — and it doesn’t look like its more than 60,000 fighters are going anywhere any time soon.

That’s because the Taliban is actually winning the war against the Afghan military, which is backed by roughly 14,000 American troops in the country. Two charts from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, the US military’s Afghanistan war watchdog, make this clear.

The first chart shows that the Taliban and other insurgent groups now control more populated areas than they did in August 2016. The second shows that insurgent groups control even more districts in Afghanistan than they did in January 2016, and their influence is growing.

This has made it hard for the US to reach some kind of peace deal with the Taliban despite nine years of trying (the Trump administration tried again in earnest as recently as last August.) Basically, the Taliban doesn’t seem to want to make concessions because it currently has the upper hand in the war.

That’s given the US less power to compel the insurgents to speak with the Afghan government, which the Taliban derides as an American puppet with little control outside the capital. The Trump administration says the only way for the war truly to end requires the Taliban and the government in Kabul to negotiate a peace deal.

Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, for his part, has repeatedly expressed a desire for Taliban talks. He reiterated that stance in a Monday address after receiving a briefing from Khalilzad on last week’s negotiations. But Ghani doesn’t want to rush discussions, he noted, saying that a bad deal could lead to bloodshed in the future and make life worse for the people of Afghanistan — particularly the women and minorities who suffered greatly under Taliban rule.

It would still be a major sign of progress if the Taliban ultimately agreed to meet with the Afghan government. The problem is that the most difficult part — ironing out the specifics of an Afghanistan-Taliban deal — would come next.

Why a deal between the Taliban and the Afghan government is so hard to strike

Experts I spoke to noted a variety of potential problems that could impede an Afghanistan-Taliban deal, and all of them said such a deal could take months to years to make. The issues break down into roughly two categories: how much power the Taliban gets to have, and what America’s future role will be.

Let’s look at each one.

1) How much power does the Taliban get?

In the short term, this is likely the biggest sticking point.

The Taliban wants to govern the country again like it did prior to the US-led invasion in 2001. It therefore aims to obtain as much power as it possibly can in any potential deal.

Some ways it could do that might include taking control of certain government ministries, or even rewriting parts of the country’s Constitution to align more favorably with its conservative Islamist ideology. The Taliban may also push for a deal whereby the government controls the capital and other populous areas while the Taliban takes over parts of the country’s east and south — areas it controlled even at the height of the war.

Finally, and controversially, Taliban fighters could even integrate into the Afghan military. That’d be hard to swallow for many, as the group has killed thousands of Afghans and Americans. It’s unclear if the US would continue to fund or support Afghan forces if Taliban militants join their ranks.

Either of those possibilities would give the Taliban way more authority over the state than it has now.

One idea Ghani, the Afghan president, and the Taliban have already rejected is to form an interim government, where the insurgent group’s leaders would temporarily join the administration and allow talks to continue. The Trump administration and Ghani, though, say elections are the only way to have a democratic and representative government in Kabul.

Ironically, a vote could complicate the talks. Afghanistan will hold a presidential election in July, and as of now there’s no clear front-runner. No candidate, especially Ghani, will want to look like they will make any concessions to the Taliban. That means it’s less likely the government and the militants can find a mutually agreeable arrangement before then.

The insurgents don’t have a candidate in the election, in part because they know they can’t win. “The Taliban represent a small fraction of the Afghan population,” Frances Brown, an Afghanistan expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told me. “Afghan society in 2019 looks very different from Afghanistan in the 1990s.”

But all of the talks assume one thing: that the security situation in the country remains about where it is — and that depends heavily on US involvement.

2) What is America’s future role in Afghanistan?

Trump has made no secret of his desire to remove US troops from Afghanistan. After months of pushing back against his advisers, the president reluctantly sent 3,000 more service members into the country in September 2017, upping the total to 14,000. He’s now considering cutting that number in half this year, although there’s no indication of an imminent announcement.

Still, the open talk of withdrawal has led to some to speculate the Trump administration would back even a minimal agreement so the military can rush out the door. “Kabuki theater is what this is,” Bill Roggio, an expert on Afghanistan at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies think tank, told me.

Roggio added that a withdrawal now, or at least talk of it, would harm any negotiations the Afghan government has with the Taliban. The insurgents could simply wait for Trump to tire of diplomacy and recall US troops home without completing the negotiations. There’s precedent for this: Despite ISIS’s continued presence in Syria, in December Trump shockingly ordered the return of America’s 2,000 troops stationed there. (However, that drawdown has not yet started in earnest.)

What’s more, it’s highly likely the Taliban will renege on any commitment it makes to the Afghan government if US forces aren’t around to back Kabul. Put together, Roggio said, “the US is debasing itself to the Taliban to get a peace deal that won’t result in peace.”

He’s not alone in that thinking. Vanda Felbab-Brown, an insurgency expert at the Brookings Institution think tank, told me there’s a “high likelihood we’re seeing a repeat of the Vietnam War negotiations.” In that instance, the US left the fight in 1973 after striking a deal with the North Vietnamese in hopes they would negotiate with their enemy, the South Vietnamese, and end the war.

WASHINGTON — New identities created for known terrorists or terror suspects in the government Witness Security Program were not passed on for inclusion on national terrorist watch lists, an internal Justice Department report has found.

The lapse, according to a report issued Thursday by Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz, allowed an undisclosed number of witnesses — banned from air travel under their original identities — to fly on commercial flights.

The audit of the highly secretive witness protection program, which for more than four decades has offered cover for thousands of criminals and innocents who have agreed to cooperate with authorities in a range of prosecutions, did not disclose the number of flights involved.

Until the matter was brought to the attention of senior Justice officials last year, according to the report, ""it was possible for known or suspected terrorists to fly on commercial airplanes in or over the United States and evade one of the government's primary means of identifying and tracking terrorists' movements and actions.''

Last July, according to the report, the U.S. Marshals Service stated that it was ""unable to locate two former witness protection members, classified as known or suspected terrorists.''

It is now believed that both may be living outside the U.S.

Responding to the report, Justice officials said Thursday that the two former witnesses have since been located and that they had fulfilled their obligations to the U.S. government before leaving the program ""several years ago.''

The two are not classified as fugitives, and they were not considered threats, though authorities declined to elaborate on their previous criminal associations.

""The (Justice) Department has identified, located and minimized the threat of all former known or suspected terrorists admitted to the WitSec program during its 40-year history,'' Armando Bonilla, senior counsel to the deputy attorney general, said in a written response to the inspector general's report.

terrorism,Fox News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/05/08/whistle-blowers-testify-on-benghazi-attacks/,Whistle-blower: Botched talking points hurt FBI probe of Benghazi attack ,2013-05-08,,"A key Benghazi whistle-blower , responding to Democratic claims that the prolonged scrutiny over the administration 's botched talking points is unwarranted , testified Wednesday that the early mischaracterization of the attack may have actually hurt the FBI 's investigation .
`` I definitely believe that it negatively affected our ability to get the FBI team quickly to Benghazi , '' said Greg Hicks , the deputy chief of mission in Libya who became the top U.S. diplomat in the country after Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed . He claimed the Libyan president was angered by the mischaracterization , in turn slowing the U.S. probe .
The claim was one of several new accounts given at Wednesday 's high-profile hearing where three whistle-blowers testified .
Democrats , while giving deference to the officials and their version of events , used the hearing to try and deflect criticism away from the administration . In particular , they rejected the notion that early talking points on the attack were deliberately changed , to downplay terrorism , for political reasons .
`` People who have actually seen the documents , who have actually conducted a real investigation completely reject the allegation that they were made for political purposes , '' Rep. John Tierney , D-Mass. , said .

`` I think the American people learned today ... the facts as we were told before , during and after Benghazi simply are n't as they were , '' Rep. Darrell Issa , chairman of the oversight committee holding the hearing , said .
Hicks was asked to respond to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's statement at a prior hearing asking `` what difference '' do the questions over the talking points make .
Hicks argued that Rice 's comments so insulted the Libyan president -- since they contradicted his Sept. 16 claims that the attack was premeditated -- that it slowed the FBI 's investigation .
`` President Magariaf was insulted in front of his own people , in front of the world . His credibility was reduced , '' Hicks said , adding that the president was apparently `` still steamed '' two weeks later .
This bad blood , he claimed , contributed to the FBI team being stuck in Tripoli for about 17-18 days . He added that the U.S. could not even get the Libyans to secure the crime scene during that time .
As for Rice 's comments that Sunday , when she repeatedly cited the video as the trigger for the attack , Hicks said his `` jaw dropped '' when he heard that .
`` I was stunned , '' Hicks said . `` My jaw dropped , and I was embarrassed . ''
He said Rice never talked to him before those appearances .
Hicks said the only information coming out of his team was that there was an `` attack '' on the consulate . `` The YouTube video was a non-event in Libya , '' he said .
State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell disputed Hicks ' version of events , noting the Libyan government gave visas to the FBI team as soon as their paperwork was received .
`` The team could not travel to Benghazi for some time due to the security situation on the ground , '' he said , noting the Libyan president voiced `` readiness '' to cooperate in late September .
As for Rice 's Sept. 16 comments , he said it would have been `` irresponsible '' for Rice to have backed what the Libyan president said `` on the spot , '' when it was `` inconsistent with our own intelligence community 's current best assessment that there was not any evidence of months-long pre-planning or pre-meditation , which remains their assessment . ''
At the hearing , Hicks also detailed alleged retaliation in the department . He claimed that , when he asked a superior about the Rice interviews , he was told `` he should not proceed '' with his questions . He was later given a `` blistering critique '' of his management style and effectively demoted to `` desk officer , '' he claimed .
Hicks ' testimony marked some of the most detailed of any delivered Wednesday . He and others also suggested the State Department 's internal review into the attack was lacking . Hicks said when he was interviewed by the group , a stenographer was not present .
In hours of testimony , the witnesses recounted in great detail what happened in eastern Libya on Sept. 11 and how U.S. personnel came under a series of attacks that left four Americans dead . Though Democratic officials have argued the attack has been thoroughly investigated and that the hearing Wednesday was political in nature , the claims challenged several long-standing assertions by the Obama administration .
The witnesses criticized the lax security at the Benghazi site in the run-up to the attack , and suggested the military did not do all it good to respond to the scene that night despite claims to the contrary .
Hicks also revealed that it appeared some were trying to lure even more U.S. personnel into a separate `` ambush '' while the attack was still being carried out . He described how , as diplomatic officials were trying to find out what happened to Stevens , they were receiving phone calls from supposed tipsters saying they knew where the ambassador was and urging Americans to come get him .
`` We suspected that we were being baited into a trap , '' Hicks said , adding that he did not want to send anybody into what he suspected was an `` ambush . ''
Getting choked up , Hicks described how the Libyan prime minister later called him to tell him Stevens was in fact dead . `` I think it 's the saddest phone call I 've ever had in my life , '' he said .
At the very beginning of the attack , before Stevens went missing and was later found dead , Hicks said his team believed it was terrorism . He said a regional security officer rushed into his villa yelling , `` Greg , Greg , the consulate 's under attack . ''
He then spoke by phone with Stevens who told him the same : `` Greg , we 're under attack . ''
After enduring a night of attacks on the U.S. consulate , Hicks said the team departed at dawn for the nearby annex -- shortly after they arrived , `` the mortars came . ''
Another whistle-blower questioned Wednesday why more military assets were not deployed sooner during the Benghazi terror attack . Mark Thompson , a former Marine and official with the State Department 's Counterterrorism Bureau , said he was rebuffed by the White House when he asked for a specialized team -- known as a FEST team -- to be deployed . This is a unit made of special operations personnel , diplomatic security , intelligence and other officers .
Suggesting that some were hesitant to deploy because they were unsure what was happening , `` One definition of a crisis is you do not know what 's going to happen in two hours , '' he said .
Further , Hicks explained how a separate team of special forces personnel were not given the authorization to fly from Tripoli to Benghazi . `` They were furious , '' he said .
Issa defended the witnesses , calling them `` actual experts on what really happened before , during and after the Benghazi attacks , '' who `` deserve to be heard . ''
The three witnesses were Hicks , Thompson and Eric Nordstrom , a diplomatic security officer who was formerly the regional security officer in Libya ; and Thompson .
`` I am a career public servant , '' Hicks said . `` Until the aftermath of Benghazi , I loved every day of my job . ''
Rep. Elijah Cummings , D-Md. , top Democrat on the oversight committee , said Wednesday that Republicans are using the witnesses ' statements for `` political purposes . '' He said he 's glad the whistle-blowers are testifying and would ensure they are protected , but pre-emptively challenged some of their claims -- including the claim that U.S. military could have responded sooner to the site of the attack .
The Obama administration has adamantly denied several of the latest charges , including a claim that then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and a key aide tried to cut the department 's own counterterrorism bureau out of the chain of reporting and decision-making on Sept. 11 . The administration also denied that the whistle-blowers in question were intimidated -- while behind the scenes questioning the credibility of the witnesses .
A `` fact sheet '' released by the department ahead of the hearing reiterated its denials . The statement said the department has `` demonstrated an unprecedented degree of cooperation with the Congress '' on Libya , and rejected claims that the military was in a position to help that night but was told to stand down . Citing its internal review , the statement noted the review `` found no evidence of any undue delays in decision making or denial of support from Washington or from the military combatant commanders . ''","A key Benghazi whistle-blower, responding to Democratic claims that the prolonged scrutiny over the administration's botched talking points is unwarranted, testified Wednesday that the early mischaracterization of the attack may have actually hurt the FBI's investigation.

""I definitely believe that it negatively affected our ability to get the FBI team quickly to Benghazi,"" said Greg Hicks, the deputy chief of mission in Libya who became the top U.S. diplomat in the country after Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed. He claimed the Libyan president was angered by the mischaracterization, in turn slowing the U.S. probe.

The claim was one of several new accounts given at Wednesday's high-profile hearing where three whistle-blowers testified.

Democrats, while giving deference to the officials and their version of events, used the hearing to try and deflect criticism away from the administration. In particular, they rejected the notion that early talking points on the attack were deliberately changed, to downplay terrorism, for political reasons.

""People who have actually seen the documents, who have actually conducted a real investigation completely reject the allegation that they were made for political purposes,"" Rep. John Tierney, D-Mass., said.

But the substance of the claims Wednesday could serve to re-open questions about that deadly night -- and specifically about the initial claim by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice that the attack was triggered by a protest over an anti-Islam film.

""I think the American people learned today ... the facts as we were told before, during and after Benghazi simply aren't as they were,"" Rep. Darrell Issa, chairman of the oversight committee holding the hearing, said.

`` The terrorist came into our country through what is called the 'Diversity Visa Lottery Program , ' a Chuck Schumer beauty , '' Trump tweeted . `` I want merit based . ''
Schumer was a key shaper of the 1990 legislation that created the program , but also played a lead part in the 2013 Gang of Eight bill that that passed the Senate on a bipartisan basis and included removing the diversity lottery program .

Sen. Jeff Flake , an Arizona Republican who has been an ardent critic of Trump , noted in a tweet Wednesday that the Gang of Eight bill , had it been signed into law , would have done away with the diversity visa program .

The gunman's social media postings reflect a radical Sunni extremist theology

The deadly siege of a central Sydney cafe has ended but the investigation is just beginning.

Australian authorities stormed the cafe where a self-styled Muslim cleric had been holding hostages early Tuesday, killing the gunman. They moved in some 16 hours after the siege began, after hearing gunfire inside the Lindt Chocolate Cafe, New South Wales police Commissioner Andrew P. Scipione told reporters.

Two of the 17 hostages initially held by the gunman died, according to Scipione. They were later identified as Katrina Dawson, 38, and Tori Johnson, 34. Other people were injured, including a police officer who suffered a wound to the face from gunshot pellets. All were described by police to be in stable condition.

""Understandably, there is a lot of speculation, but it will take time to clarify exactly what happened ... and why,"" Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told reporters Tuesday.

Man Haron Monis.

What did the gunman want? Why did he choose the cafe as his target?

""There is nothing more Australian than dropping in at the local cafe for a morning coffee, and it's tragic beyond words that people going about their everyday business should have been caught up in such a horrific incident,"" Abbott said.

He offered his condolences to people caught in the attack and to their loved ones.

How the siege unfolded

Hundreds of police officers, including snipers, surrounded the cafe in Sydney's central business district shortly after the gunman took over the building at 10 a.m. Monday (6 p.m. ET Sunday).

Chilling images from Australian media showed people, believed to be hostages, with their hands pressed against the cafe's windows. They were holding up a black flag with Arabic writing on it reading, ""There is no God but God and Mohammed is the prophet of God.""

It should be painfully clear by now that no one of authority is in charge at the White House, least of all President Obama.

terrorism,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/4/wh-failed-secret-mission-rescue-american-al-qaeda/,White House confirms failed secret mission to rescue American held by al Qaeda,2014-12-04,Guy Taylor,"Hours before the Obama administration revealed Thursday that a secret U.S. special forces mission had failed to rescue American hostage Luke Somers in Yemen last month , al Qaeda ’ s branch in the nation circulated a harrowing video giving Washington three days to meet unspecified demands or face “ consequences ” for Mr. Somers .
With speculation swirling that the threatening video may be what prompted administration officials to reveal the botched rescue mission , some in Washington were quick to warn the White House against negotiating with the terrorists .
“ The Obama administration must not waiver from the United States ’ long-standing policy of not negotiating with terrorists , ” said Rep. Michael McCaul , the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security .
The Texas Republican asserted that Mr. Obama set a dangerous precedent for such negotiations earlier this year by authorizing the release of five former high-level Taliban officials from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Army Sgt . Bowe Bergdahl , an American held hostage in Afghanistan for five years .
But Mr. Somers ‘ case is notably different . The 33-year-old photojournalist is an American citizen who born in Britain . He had been working in Yemen since 2011 as a freelancer for the Yemen Times when operatives from al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) kidnapped him in September 2013 .
The video circulated Thursday was the first showing Mr. Somers in captivity .
The footage seemed designed to mimic hostage videos released recently by AQAP rivals from the Islamic State group , which has threatened — and later beheaded — several American and British hostages in the aftermath of a summer blitz that captured large swaths of Iraq and Syria .
The Islamic State fighters have at times battled al Qaeda-aligned groups like AQAP and prompted defections among their rivals .
In the 3-minute video , Mr. Somers appears somber and gives a brief statement in English , asking for help . The video was first reported by SITE Intelligence Group , which monitors militant sites .
“ It ’ s now been well over a year since I ’ ve been kidnapped in Sanaa , ” Mr. Somers said . “ Basically , I ’ m looking for any help that can get me out of this situation . I ’ m certain that my life is in danger . So as I sit here now , I ask , if anything can be done , please let it be done . Thank you very much . ”
Before Mr. Somers ‘ statement , the video shows local al Qaeda commander Nasser bin Ali al-Ansi , reading in Arabic and speaking about alleged American “ crimes against ” the Muslim world .
Al-Ansi criticizes US-led airstrikes against the Islamic State group and President Obama for his “ latest foolish action , ” referring to the “ failed operation ” in Hadramawt . He says an “ elite group of mujahedeen , ” or holy warriors , were killed in the U.S. raid .
He also warned the U.S. against more “ stupidities , ” referring to future attempts to rescue hostages .
Al-Ansi gives the U.S. three days to meet al Qaeda ’ s demands or “ otherwise , the American hostage held by us will meet his inevitable fate , ” without elaborating or explicitly saying they would kill their captive . He doesn ’ t specify the demands but says Washington is “ aware ” of them .
Officials at the White House and Pentagon said Thursday that Mr. Obama had personally authorized last month ’ s mission to rescue Mr. Somers , the lone American among roughly a dozen hostages held by AQAP in Yemen .
“ The mission was coordinated with the Yemeni government and was undertaken by U.S. and Yemeni forces , ” said National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan . “ Regrettably , Luke was not present , though hostages of other nationalities were present and were rescued . ”
In a statement , Ms. Meehan said the “ details of the operation remain classified . ”
A report by the BBC Thursday , said U.S. and Yemeni forces rescued six Yemenis , a Saudi and an Ethiopian being held by AQAP in a Nov. 25 operation at a mountain cave in the remote Hajr al-Sayar district of Yemen ’ s Hadramawt province .
In light of Thursday ’ s developments , Mr. McCaul warned the administration to proceed carefully and assertively in the Somers case . “ This administration has already broken this policy once with the release of the Taliban Five , and in doing so allowed dangerous terrorists to resume the fight , ” he said .
“ AQAP ’ s latest threat against an American hostage reflects the unrelenting and pervasive brutality of Islamist extremist groups who are at war with the West , ” the Texas Republican added . “ We must send a clear message to extremists : ‘ We will not negotiate with you . We will do everything in our power to stop you and bring you to justice . ’ ”","Hours before the Obama administration revealed Thursday that a secret U.S. special forces mission had failed to rescue American hostage Luke Somers in Yemen last month, al Qaeda’s branch in the nation circulated a harrowing video giving Washington three days to meet unspecified demands or face “consequences” for Mr. Somers.

In light of Thursday’s developments, Mr. McCaul warned the administration to proceed carefully and assertively in the Somers case. “This administration has already broken this policy once with the release of the Taliban Five, and in doing so allowed dangerous terrorists to resume the fight,” he said.

“AQAP’s latest threat against an American hostage reflects the unrelenting and pervasive brutality of Islamist extremist groups who are at war with the West,” the Texas Republican added. “We must send a clear message to extremists: ‘We will not negotiate with you. We will do everything in our power to stop you and bring you to justice.’”

terrorism,Washington Times,2,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/oct/21/iran-terrorists-lurk-embassies/,"Iranian terrorists lurk abroad in guise of diplomats, dissidents report",2018-10-21,Rowan Scarborough,"A report from Iranian dissidents shows how the hard-line Islamic regime places terrorist operatives abroad under the cover of diplomacy .
From Austria to Albania to Iraq , an expansionist Iran has turned embassies into terrorism planning sites to meddle in host governments and hunt down the opposition , according to the report by the National Council of Resistance of Iran . The coalition includes the activist chapter known as MEK , which operates far-flung spy networks in Iran .
The report , “ Iran Doubles Down on Terror and Turmoil , ” presents a big-picture assessment of Iran ’ s foreign interventions in Iraq , Syria , Lebanon and Yemen , and its terrorism-sponsored plots in Europe .
“ The mullahs ’ regime has funneled billions of dollars to finance its belligerent war agenda in the Middle East while the majority of Iran ’ s people are living in poverty , ” the report states . “ As the regime ’ s officials have conceded , if the regime fails to inflame wars outside Iran ’ s borders , it would have to fight for survival within Iran ’ s borders . This is because external conflicts draw attention away from domestic crises . ”
The National Council ’ s 57-page report contains the tale of ruling Muslim mullahs on the march , unleashing abroad a number of state organs and paid militiamen to wage war . They include : the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , Iran ’ s dominant security apparatus ; the Quds Force , a committed band of paramilitary foreign provocateurs ; the Ministry of Intelligence and Security ( MOIS ) and its operations arm , the Organization for Foreign Intelligence and Movements ( OFIM ) .
In Syria alone , the Revolutionary Guard controls as many as 100,000 troops . The Iranians fight alongside forces of Syrian President Bashar Assad , who the U.S. says has killed thousands of innocent civilians to stay in power .
⦁ Assadollah Assadi . Stationed at the Iranian Embassy in Vienna as a “ counselor , ” Mr. Assadi is an expert in explosives and played a “ decisive role ” in killing American forces in Iraq from 2004 to 2008 . European authorities arrested Mr. Assadi in July for masterminding a thwarted car-bomb attack on a huge gathering of National Council members near Paris .
MOIS has made the Vienna embassy its hub for orchestrating attacks on dissidents . A German court this month approved Mr. Assadi ’ s extradition to Belgium .
⦁ Gholamhossein Mohammadnia . The senior MOIS deputy became the Iranian ambassador to Albania in 2016 .
Why is Albania important ? That same year the MEK completed relocating its headquarters from Iraq to Tirana . The National Council says the embassy has since planned several missions against its members .
“ The embassy increasingly came under the control of MOIS agents , ” the National Council says .
⦁ Reza Amiri Moghadam . The head of MOIS ’ operations unit , Mr. Moghadam has been deployed overseas as a “ diplomat , ” allowing him to meet with the U.S. ambassador in Iraq in 2007 . MOIS agents in Europe report to him in Tehran .
“ He is the key figure for the regime ’ s terrorist operations outside Iran , particularly in Europe and the U.S. , ” the National Council ’ s report said .
⦁ Iraj Masjedi . The Iranian ambassador to Iraq is a veteran commander of the Quds Force , which orchestrated bombing attacks on U.S. troops . He is also a chief adviser to Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani , the Revolutionary Guard commander and dedicated U.S. foe . He controls various Shiite militias in Iraq , totaling 100,000 . The Pentagon estimates that Iran helped anti-American Iraqis kill 500 U.S. troops with roadside bombs .
“ All of the Iranian regime ’ s terrorist operations in Iraq were controlled and commanded by [ Mr. Masjedi ] , ” the Iranian opposition report said . “ Under the guise of its ambassador , the regime has continued meddling in Iraq . ”
Gen. Soleimani has made several visits to Iraq , the last believed to be in August .
“ He is trying to threaten and intimidate various parties and groups to secure a larger share of power for the Iranian regime , ” the National Council ’ s report said .
Iran ’ s biggest bet is on Syria , where it participated with Russia in the infamous 2016 rape of Aleppo , killing hundreds of civilians while conquering the besieged rebel stronghold .
The council estimates that Iran has pumped as much as $ 100 billion into Syria to build bases , pay troops and ship weapons .
Iran has divided the country into five war zones , including territory controlled by U.S.-backed anti-Assad fighters who liberated Raqqa and other towns from brutal Islamic State occupation .
In Iran , Gen. Soleimani controls fighters from Afghanistan , Pakistan and Iraq , along with its sponsored army , the Lebanese Hezbollah .
Since MEK set up its new home in Albania with 270 members , the National Council says , Iran has turned a bare-bones embassy of one or two personnel into “ one of the most important Iranian embassies in Europe . ”
The report states : “ In 2017 Mostafa Roudaki , who had been in charge of the intelligence station in the regime ’ s embassy in Austria , became the head of station in Albania , and was tasked with increasing the espionage and terrorist activities against the MEK . ”
In March , Albanian authorities arrested two Iranian agents who planned to set off a truck bomb at a Persian celebration , the report says .","A report from Iranian dissidents shows how the hard-line Islamic regime places terrorist operatives abroad under the cover of diplomacy.

Manchester Arena attack : what we know so far Read more
For a split second there was silence . Then the screams began . “ Oh my God , ” said one woman , who was filming at the moment the piped music was punctured by the blast . “ What ’ s going on ? What just happened ? ”
“ The bang echoed around the foyer of the arena , and people started to run , ” said 17-year-old Oliver Jones , who attended the concert with his 19-year-old sister . “ I saw people running and screaming in one direction , and then many were turning around to run back the other way . Security was running out as well as the fans and concert-goers . ”
Teenagers rushed for the exits , some clambering over barriers to drop into the stairwells . A woman in a wheelchair was trapped by the crowd , according to Karen Ford , who had taken her daughter to the concert . “ She was absolutely hysterical , bless her , people were just pushing past her so I held them back while she got out of the stairwell , ” she told the BBC .
“ The problem was there were a lot of children there without parents ; there was no one to calm them down . ”

Terrifying as it was for the fans inside , it was those in the foyer just outside the concert hall who witnessed the full horror .
Andy Holey was waiting in the lobby for his wife and daughter , exchanging chitchat with a member of the arena staff , when he was flung nearly 10 metres through a set of doors by the enormous blast , he said . “ When I got up and walked around , there were about 30 people scattered everywhere . Some of them looked dead , they might have been unconscious , but there were a lot of fatalities , ” he told the BBC .

He rushed to find his wife and daughter inside . “ When I couldn ’ t find them , I went outside ... and looked through some of the bodies to try to find my family , ” Holey said . They were eventually reunited outside .
Emma Johnson was waiting at the top of the foyer stairs for her two teenage daughters when she idly spotted , among the crowds , someone wearing an incongruous bright red top , under which were what she described as “ risen bits ” – the person she believes was the bomber . She said : “ It was that which stood out because it was so intense among the crowds of people . As quick as I saw it , the explosion happened .
“ Your ears – it is so loud . You see this flash of light and there was shrapnel everywhere . The glass exploded and people were screaming : ‘ I have to get to my children . ’
“ All I think about is these poor families . Every time I close my eyes I envision a young girl crying for her mum because her head was in a pool of blood and her husband was trying to bring her around . ”
Some witnesses described nuts and bolts among the bomb debris , suggesting the bomber may have packed the device with shrapnel to cause more injuries . Paul Dryhurst , from Sheffield , said his niece Claire Booth and her daughter Hollie , 11 , had been caught up the blast .
“ When the bomb has gone off the impact has broken Claire ’ s jaw and broken Hollie ’ s legs . They are both currently in hospital having nuts and bolts removed , ” he said . Booth ’ s sister Kelly Brewster , who had been with them , was still unaccounted for , he said .
As the panicked crowds spilled on to the streets around the arena and the first of 60 ambulances raced to the scene , the city of Manchester rallied to help .
Hotels opened their doors to take in many of the young people who found themselves separated from friends and relatives or stranded following the lockdown of Victoria station next door . Taxi drivers switched off their meters to take people home , or ferry them to hospital .
AJ Singh , one of the drivers who had worked for much of the night , told Channel 4 News : “ I ’ ve had people who needed to find loved ones , I ’ ve dropped them off at the hospitals , they had no money , they were stranded . We should come out and show whoever has done this : Manchester , we ’ re glue . We stick together when it counts . ”
Off-duty doctors made their way to the eight Greater Manchester hospitals where the 59 casualties of the blast , many of them children , were taken . Others worked through the night , enduring what the prime minister , Theresa May , would later call “ traumatic and terrible scenes ” .
On Twitter , the hashtag # RoomsforManchester was trending as locals offered refuge to those affected . “ I ’ m three minutes from Victoria station with a comfy sofa , wifi , chargers and teabags , ” began one message from Laura O ’ Connor .
But alongside the offers of help , social media was host to desperate messages from people whose daughters , brothers , partners and friends had been at the concert , and who had not managed to reach them after the blast .
Stuart Aspinall , 25 , said he was trying to find his friend Martyn Hett after they were separated towards the end of the gig . Aspinall shared photos of the 29-year-old , from Stockport , on Facebook to help track him down .
He wrote : “ The more news that is coming out , the scarier this is getting . There was an explosion at the Ariana Grande concert tonight in Manchester and I haven ’ t seen my friend Martyn since . ”
Hett ’ s brother Dan said he was still missing on Tuesday afternoon .
Many relatives frantically checked the hospitals where victims were taken . Outside the city ’ s Royal Infirmary , a 17-year-old girl , part of a family from the Philippines , told ███ she was looking for her mother , whom she had lost in the chaos after the explosion . Her mother ’ s partner had been injured , but she had no information on her mum .
Ellie Ward,17 , had seen her grandfather at the hospital , after he was hit by shrapnel while waiting to collect her and her friend after the show . “ He ’ s OK , but he ’ s cut his cheek , ” she said , saying the 64-year-old had been hit by falling glass while waiting close to the merchandise stand in the corridor beneath the arena ’ s tiered seating . “ He said he only realised what had happened when he felt the side of his head and it was bleeding . ”
As Tuesday dawned on an unusually hushed city , dazed teenagers , some accompanied by their parents , stumbled from the city centre ’ s hotels in the hope of finally making their way home . Hayley Lunt , who had sheltered with her 10-year-old daughter , Annabel , at a nearby hotel , said they had not slept and were still shaken .
“ It ’ s surreal . It ’ s almost like we weren ’ t there , ” Lunt said . “ It ’ s like a bad movie . I think it ’ ll take a few days for us to come to terms with it . ”
The Greater Manchester mayor , Andy Burnham , who had been briefed throughout the night , spoke of the “ evil act ” that had occurred . “ It is hard to believe what has happened here in the last few hours , and to put into words the shock , anger , and hurt that we feel today , ” he said .
“ These were children , young people and their families that those responsible chose to terrorise and kill . This was an evil act . ”
He paid tribute to those who had opened their doors and offered lifts to those affected , calling the city ’ s response the “ best possible message to those who seek to divide us ” .
“ We are grieving today , but we are strong . Today it will be business as usual , as far as possible , in our great city , ” said Burnham .
“ Manchester has had some dark days in the past , ” said Sir Richard Leese , the leader of the city council , adding : “ I don ’ t think I can think of anything that matches the horror of what happened last night . ”
An NHS blood donation centre on Norfolk Street in the city centre said it had been forced to turn people away , asking them to make appointments for a later date , such was the number of offers . Karen Hodgins , a nurse at the centre , said there was a queue of about 70 people on Tuesday morning . She said people were being turned away unless they had the blood group O negative .
“ Most people are not the blood group that we need , which is O negative , the universal blood type . It ’ s not rare but it can go to anybody , ” she said .
Waiting outside the centre , Adam Sharp , 25 , said he had come along with his colleagues to “ try and do my bit ” . “ I ’ ve registered before but have never donated , ” he said .
Standing nearby was Jules Boyle , 24 , with a large group of colleagues . She had woken to the news of the bombing . “ I ’ ve never given blood before so I thought it was an appropriate time , ” she said .
As the first names and photographs of the young victims began to emerge , the city remained on high alert . Shortly before noon , Greater Manchester police confirmed they had arrested a 23-year-old in Chorlton , in the south of the city . Armed police also sealed off Elsmore Road , a street in the Fallowfield area of south Manchester , and carried out a controlled explosion on the house of the man they later named as the suicide bomber , 22-year-old Salman Ramadan Abedi .
More than a dozen officers in unmarked cars and police vans also raided a flat in Whalley Range at about 12.20pm , believed to be the home of Abedi ’ s brother Ismael , who is 23 .
Early on Tuesday evening , under a blue sky and a still-bright sun , thousands of people began gathering in the city ’ s Albert Square for a vigil , attended by faith leaders and political figures including Burnham , Rudd , the Labour leader , Jeremy Corbyn and Tim Farron , leader of the Liberal Democrats , to remember the dead and express a message of unity and defiance .
Lu Bowen , 40 , brought flowers to lay , saying it had been a horrific day . Standing alongside her teenage daughter Lucy , she said : “ We watched it all unfold last night . We felt we wanted to show a sense of solidarity and commitment that Manchester always has .","Ariana Grande had just taken her final bow, the house lights had come up and 18,000 concert-goers were filing cheerfully towards the doors when the excitable hubbub inside Manchester Arena was suddenly shattered.

“The problem was there were a lot of children there without parents; there was no one to calm them down.”

She said: “It was that which stood out because it was so intense among the crowds of people. As quick as I saw it, the explosion happened.

“Your ears – it is so loud. You see this flash of light and there was shrapnel everywhere. The glass exploded and people were screaming: ‘I have to get to my children.’

“All I think about is these poor families. Every time I close my eyes I envision a young girl crying for her mum because her head was in a pool of blood and her husband was trying to bring her around.”

Some witnesses described nuts and bolts among the bomb debris, suggesting the bomber may have packed the device with shrapnel to cause more injuries. Paul Dryhurst, from Sheffield, said his niece Claire Booth and her daughter Hollie, 11, had been caught up the blast.

“When the bomb has gone off the impact has broken Claire’s jaw and broken Hollie’s legs. They are both currently in hospital having nuts and bolts removed,” he said. Booth’s sister Kelly Brewster, who had been with them, was still unaccounted for, he said.

As the panicked crowds spilled on to the streets around the arena and the first of 60 ambulances raced to the scene, the city of Manchester rallied to help.

Hotels opened their doors to take in many of the young people who found themselves separated from friends and relatives or stranded following the lockdown of Victoria station next door. Taxi drivers switched off their meters to take people home, or ferry them to hospital.

AJ Singh, one of the drivers who had worked for much of the night, told Channel 4 News: “I’ve had people who needed to find loved ones, I’ve dropped them off at the hospitals, they had no money, they were stranded. We should come out and show whoever has done this: Manchester, we’re glue. We stick together when it counts.”

Off-duty doctors made their way to the eight Greater Manchester hospitals where the 59 casualties of the blast, many of them children, were taken. Others worked through the night, enduring what the prime minister, Theresa May, would later call “traumatic and terrible scenes”.

On Twitter, the hashtag #RoomsforManchester was trending as locals offered refuge to those affected. “I’m three minutes from Victoria station with a comfy sofa, wifi, chargers and teabags,” began one message from Laura O’Connor.

But alongside the offers of help, social media was host to desperate messages from people whose daughters, brothers, partners and friends had been at the concert, and who had not managed to reach them after the blast.

Stuart Aspinall, 25, said he was trying to find his friend Martyn Hett after they were separated towards the end of the gig. Aspinall shared photos of the 29-year-old, from Stockport, on Facebook to help track him down.

He wrote: “The more news that is coming out, the scarier this is getting. There was an explosion at the Ariana Grande concert tonight in Manchester and I haven’t seen my friend Martyn since.”

Hett’s brother Dan said he was still missing on Tuesday afternoon.

Many relatives frantically checked the hospitals where victims were taken. Outside the city’s Royal Infirmary, a 17-year-old girl, part of a family from the Philippines, told the Guardian she was looking for her mother, whom she had lost in the chaos after the explosion. Her mother’s partner had been injured, but she had no information on her mum.

Ellie Ward,17, had seen her grandfather at the hospital, after he was hit by shrapnel while waiting to collect her and her friend after the show. “He’s OK, but he’s cut his cheek,” she said, saying the 64-year-old had been hit by falling glass while waiting close to the merchandise stand in the corridor beneath the arena’s tiered seating. “He said he only realised what had happened when he felt the side of his head and it was bleeding.”

As Tuesday dawned on an unusually hushed city, dazed teenagers, some accompanied by their parents, stumbled from the city centre’s hotels in the hope of finally making their way home. Hayley Lunt, who had sheltered with her 10-year-old daughter, Annabel, at a nearby hotel, said they had not slept and were still shaken.

“It’s surreal. It’s almost like we weren’t there,” Lunt said. “It’s like a bad movie. I think it’ll take a few days for us to come to terms with it.”

The Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, who had been briefed throughout the night, spoke of the “evil act” that had occurred. “It is hard to believe what has happened here in the last few hours, and to put into words the shock, anger, and hurt that we feel today,” he said.

“These were children, young people and their families that those responsible chose to terrorise and kill. This was an evil act.”

He paid tribute to those who had opened their doors and offered lifts to those affected, calling the city’s response the “best possible message to those who seek to divide us”.

“We are grieving today, but we are strong. Today it will be business as usual, as far as possible, in our great city,” said Burnham.

“Manchester has had some dark days in the past,” said Sir Richard Leese, the leader of the city council, adding: “I don’t think I can think of anything that matches the horror of what happened last night.”

An NHS blood donation centre on Norfolk Street in the city centre said it had been forced to turn people away, asking them to make appointments for a later date, such was the number of offers. Karen Hodgins, a nurse at the centre, said there was a queue of about 70 people on Tuesday morning. She said people were being turned away unless they had the blood group O negative.

“Most people are not the blood group that we need, which is O negative, the universal blood type. It’s not rare but it can go to anybody,” she said.

Waiting outside the centre, Adam Sharp, 25, said he had come along with his colleagues to “try and do my bit”. “I’ve registered before but have never donated,” he said.

Standing nearby was Jules Boyle, 24, with a large group of colleagues. She had woken to the news of the bombing. “I’ve never given blood before so I thought it was an appropriate time,” she said.

As the first names and photographs of the young victims began to emerge, the city remained on high alert. Shortly before noon, Greater Manchester police confirmed they had arrested a 23-year-old in Chorlton, in the south of the city. Armed police also sealed off Elsmore Road, a street in the Fallowfield area of south Manchester, and carried out a controlled explosion on the house of the man they later named as the suicide bomber, 22-year-old Salman Ramadan Abedi.

More than a dozen officers in unmarked cars and police vans also raided a flat in Whalley Range at about 12.20pm, believed to be the home of Abedi’s brother Ismael, who is 23.

Early on Tuesday evening, under a blue sky and a still-bright sun, thousands of people began gathering in the city’s Albert Square for a vigil, attended by faith leaders and political figures including Burnham, Rudd, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn and Tim Farron, leader of the Liberal Democrats, to remember the dead and express a message of unity and defiance.

Lu Bowen, 40, brought flowers to lay, saying it had been a horrific day. Standing alongside her teenage daughter Lucy, she said: “We watched it all unfold last night. We felt we wanted to show a sense of solidarity and commitment that Manchester always has.

PARIS — A historic crowd of more than a million people including more than 40 world leaders jammed the streets Sunday, proclaiming ""Je suis Charlie,"" expressing solidarity against terrorism and paying homage to victims of last week's deadly attacks.

Addressing the most recent events in Chapel Hill, N.C., in which three young Muslim Americans were shot and killed, Obama said it remains unclear whether the victims were targeted for their beliefs. Local authorities have said the murders were related to a parking dispute.

“But we know that many Muslim Americans across our country are worried and afraid,” Obama wrote. “Americans of all faiths and backgrounds must continue to stand united with a community in mourning.”

Calling for unity, Obama denounced groups like al Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, which he said are “peddling the lie that the United States is at war with Islam” and “exploit the anger that festers.”

“The world has to offer today’s youth something better,” Obama wrote, repeating that military force alone is not the solution to terrorism.

The president’s op-ed also comes after last week’s news that 26-year-old Kayla Mueller, a hostage kidnapped in Syria by ISIL, had died. Obama also noted that ISIL “has spread its barbarism” to Libya, while the Taliban continues attacks in Pakistan and Boko Haram continues to kidnap men and women in Nigeria.

The U.S. has “made significant gains” against terrorism, the president wrote, but the threat has also evolved, with attacks against Americans from Benghazi to Boston.

terrorism,NPR Online News,1,http://www.npr.org/2013/04/21/177757600/boston-bombs-and-lessons-from-israel,"Boston, Bombs And Lessons From Israel",2013-04-21,Greg Myre,"As reporters in Jerusalem a decade ago , my wife , Jennifer Griffin , and I covered more than 100 suicide bombings over several blood-soaked years . The carnage defined our lives as we raced to blast sites , interviewed battered survivors in emergency rooms and tracked down the extremists behind the deadly attacks .
Our two daughters were too young to grasp the chaos . But several years later , safely ensconced in Washington , they asked about 9/11 . When we explained , Amelia , then age 6 , said , `` Why did you bring us to a dangerous place like Washington ? Why could n't we stay in a safe place like Jerusalem ? ''
We 've been trying ever since to explain that America is safe . Yet the bomb blasts in Boston and manhunt that followed have forced the country to again confront the reality of terror and attempt to recognize a broader perspective .
Over the past decade , the U.S. has been largely terror-free at home . Yet terror attacks tend to have a disproportionate psychological impact far beyond the damage they inflict .
Car accidents and shootings cause tens of thousands of deaths every year in America . As terrible as the Boston blasts were , an even deadlier incident took place at a fertilizer plant in Texas . Yet it 's the terror generated in Boston that will linger in the minds of most .
In a country with an infinite number of soft , vulnerable targets , there always will be tension between providing security and allowing people to gather freely , says Rick Nelson , who studies counterterrorism at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington .
`` We 've made considerable strides in our counterterrorism capabilities over the past decade and we 're seeing that play out in Boston — from the folks on the streets , to the medical personnel in the hospitals to the coordination between local , state and federal officials , '' he says . `` The overall response has been quite remarkable . ''
So what will the atmosphere be at next year 's Boston Marathon , an event symbolizing resilience in a city synonymous with our founding freedoms ?
The Boston Globe wrote that the bombing `` will forever mar what is annually the city 's most uplifting day : Marathon Monday . ''
In The Washington Post , columnist Tracee Hamilton wrote that the Boston attacks could have a ripple effect that touches other sporting events .
`` So many communities are n't communities any longer ; they are fragmented by social or political or economic differences . Sports communities remain , '' Hamilton wrote . `` Those experiences are what will be lost if spectators decide to avoid sporting events , and that 's a shame . We have very few communities to spare these days . ''
Compared to Israel , the U.S. still has relatively little experience in dealing with terror . And even Israel has not found all the answers . Its security policies are deeply controversial and it remains locked in bitter stalemates with its Arab neighbors .
But after decades of terror , Israelis have figured out how to live with this contradiction : Something terrible could happen at any moment and there 's no reason to let fear dictate how you live .
In a book on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , my wife and I wrote :
`` We were consistently amazed at how quickly Israelis returned to places that had been bombed . The police , the rescue teams and the cleanup crews restored a bomb site to an outward semblance of normality within hours of an attack . Debris was swept out . Hoses washed away blood from the sidewalk . Shattered windows were replaced . The yellow police tape came down . The next day , Israelis placed flowers and candles at the scene . By the time those flowers wilted , the street tended to be as busy as ever . ''
For Israelis , combating terror is not just a security question . It 's a social , cultural and psychological issue and the whole country is required to play its role . It 's often measured in small deeds , like going back to a favorite cafe after an attack .

As reporters in Jerusalem a decade ago, my wife, Jennifer Griffin, and I covered more than 100 suicide bombings over several blood-soaked years. The carnage defined our lives as we raced to blast sites, interviewed battered survivors in emergency rooms and tracked down the extremists behind the deadly attacks.

Our two daughters were too young to grasp the chaos. But several years later, safely ensconced in Washington, they asked about 9/11. When we explained, Amelia, then age 6, said, ""Why did you bring us to a dangerous place like Washington? Why couldn't we stay in a safe place like Jerusalem?""

We've been trying ever since to explain that America is safe. Yet the bomb blasts in Boston and manhunt that followed have forced the country to again confront the reality of terror and attempt to recognize a broader perspective.

Over the past decade, the U.S. has been largely terror-free at home. Yet terror attacks tend to have a disproportionate psychological impact far beyond the damage they inflict.

Car accidents and shootings cause tens of thousands of deaths every year in America. As terrible as the Boston blasts were, an even deadlier incident took place at a fertilizer plant in Texas. Yet it's the terror generated in Boston that will linger in the minds of most.

Inherent Tension

In a country with an infinite number of soft, vulnerable targets, there always will be tension between providing security and allowing people to gather freely, says Rick Nelson, who studies counterterrorism at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

""We've made considerable strides in our counterterrorism capabilities over the past decade and we're seeing that play out in Boston — from the folks on the streets, to the medical personnel in the hospitals to the coordination between local, state and federal officials,"" he says. ""The overall response has been quite remarkable.""

So what will the atmosphere be at next year's Boston Marathon, an event symbolizing resilience in a city synonymous with our founding freedoms?

The Boston Globe wrote that the bombing ""will forever mar what is annually the city's most uplifting day: Marathon Monday.""

In The Washington Post, columnist Tracee Hamilton wrote that the Boston attacks could have a ripple effect that touches other sporting events.

""So many communities aren't communities any longer; they are fragmented by social or political or economic differences. Sports communities remain,"" Hamilton wrote. ""Those experiences are what will be lost if spectators decide to avoid sporting events, and that's a shame. We have very few communities to spare these days.""

Israel's Experience

Compared to Israel, the U.S. still has relatively little experience in dealing with terror. And even Israel has not found all the answers. Its security policies are deeply controversial and it remains locked in bitter stalemates with its Arab neighbors.

But after decades of terror, Israelis have figured out how to live with this contradiction: Something terrible could happen at any moment and there's no reason to let fear dictate how you live.

In a book on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, my wife and I wrote:

""We were consistently amazed at how quickly Israelis returned to places that had been bombed. The police, the rescue teams and the cleanup crews restored a bomb site to an outward semblance of normality within hours of an attack. Debris was swept out. Hoses washed away blood from the sidewalk. Shattered windows were replaced. The yellow police tape came down. The next day, Israelis placed flowers and candles at the scene. By the time those flowers wilted, the street tended to be as busy as ever.""

For Israelis, combating terror is not just a security question. It's a social, cultural and psychological issue and the whole country is required to play its role. It's often measured in small deeds, like going back to a favorite cafe after an attack.

In the deadliest year for Israelis, 2002, more than 50 suicide bombings convulsed a country that has just a few more residents than Massachusetts. It's no stretch to say that Israel endured the equivalent of a Boston Marathon bombing every week for a year.

After most every blast, cellphone lines overloaded as Israelis called loved ones to make sure they were all right. In such a small country, Israelis knew they might be connected in some way to the victims. Yet this also seemed to breed a remarkable coping mentality.

The U.S. Response



In the U.S., the 9/11 attacks forced a re-evaluation of everything from national security to legal procedures to airline travel rules. At the time, many Americans felt additional large-scale attacks were in the pipeline.

But the improved security, a more vigilant public, limited competence among would-be attackers and perhaps just a dose of luck have all combined for more than a decade of relative safety on the homefront.

""We can't ever get 100 percent security, and even if we could we wouldn't want to pay the cost,"" says Nelson, the counterterrorism analyst at CSIS. ""We will always be vulnerable to some level of attack. What we can control is how we respond. I think twice as many people should run in the Boston Marathon next year. I think that would be a good response.""

Finally righting one of many shameful actions President Barack Obama has imposed on our nation, Congress is passing legislation which makes eligible those killed and injured in the Fort Hood terrorist attack of 2009 to receive the Purple Heart.

In an early indication of the how craven Mr. Obama’s politics are, he knew the attack sent a message that with his election the enemy felt they had free reign. So, Mr. Obama decided to pretend the soldiers under attack by the enemy were in fact just victims of “workplace violence.”

The refusal by the administration to recognize the true nature of the attack meant our soldiers who were injured could not receive the Purple Heart with which comes a variety of benefits. Additionally, for those killed, their families would also be denied the additional benefits afforded loved ones whose family member gave all serving our country.

But now, that is about to change. In May of this year, language was included in the FY15 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) congressional conference agreement giving victims of that terrorist attack Purple Heart status. Before the end of the lame duck session, the only thing standing between righting this wrong for our military is the signature of Mr. Obama.

According to NBC in Dallas, Rep. Roger Williams and Rep. John Carter, Texas Republicans, released a statement Thursday saying, “This is a huge step in the joint efforts to help victims of the Fort Hood terrorist attack, and I’d like to thank Rep. John Carter and many of our Texas colleagues for their endless support. Our nation’s leaders must uphold our solemn commitment to provide for troops in harm’s way — whether at home or abroad. President Obama has neglected those whose lives were taken and forever changed that day. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation gives President Obama yet another opportunity to honor his pledge to take care of our American soldiers who were victims of terrorism.”

Yet, we didn’t need an act of Congress to make this happen. The Pentagon awarded Purple Hearts and civilian medals to all members of the armed services who were killed or wounded during the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. On Sept. 28, 2001 the Savannah Morning News reported, “All members of the U.S. armed services killed or wounded in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks will be awarded the Purple Heart, and the Defense Department has created the Defense of Freedom Medal to be awarded to all department civilians killed or wounded.

“In making the announcement Thursday, [then-] Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said the tributes were appropriate, given the unprecedented nature of the attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center. … “They were acts of war — military strikes against the United States of America,” Mr. Rumsfeld said.

What a difference a Democratic administration makes. When faced with the Fort Hood terrorist attack, the Obama Pentagon sent out a smug and sneering “position paper” detailing why they refused to award the Purple Heart to the victims. ABC News reported in April 2013, “A Pentagon position paper, delivered to congressional staff on Friday and obtained by ABC News, says giving the award to the Fort Hood victims could “irrevocably alter the fundamental character of this time-honored decoration” and “undermine the prosecution of Major Nidal Hasan [the alleged Fort Hood shooter] by materially and directly compromising Major Hasan’s ability to receive a fair trial. …

For the Obama administration, so fond of executive orders, and reigning with his pen and phone, his refusal to allow the Purple Heart for the Fort Hood massacre victims remains one of his more disturbed actions.

The right thing to do was obvious to President George W. Bush and Secretary Rumsfeld. Now, with Secretary Hagel on his way out, will Defense Secretary nominee Ash Carter do the right thing, or be as determined as his boss to continue the insult?

With this legislation, even though five years late, we are also reminded about what Congress can do, if they really want to. It was clear in the spring of this election year that we ‘stupid’ natives had grown restless. Amazing how much politicians can get done when we the people begin to order up the tar and feathers.

terrorism,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jun/4/a-drone-war-over-semantics/,KEMPTON: A drone war over semantics,2013-06-04,Daniel R. Kempton,"In an effort that was once ideological and has now deteriorated into semantics , President Obama refuses to use the phrase “ global war on terrorism. ” While Mr. Obama ’ s linguistic acrobatics sometimes seem silly or even petty , they have a purpose . Candidate Obama banned the phrase to signal to progressives his visceral condemnation of the tactics George W. Bush had used in the “ war ” paradigm to justify . He rejected the use of enhanced interrogation , labeled “ torture ” the indefinite detention of “ enemy combatants , ” and proscribed trial by military tribunals . Instead , Mr. Obama contended that terrorism was a particularly heinous form of crime and required no deviation from the civilian criminal justice system . With the terrorism-as-crime paradigm , one would seek the legal extradition of terrorists , arrest — not kill — them , hold them for trial in civilian courts , and sentence them to the existing penal system .
Mr. Obama ’ s May 23 speech to the National Defense University demonstrated his inability to develop an alternative to the war paradigm and to keep his promises to fundamentally alter the tactics . While he again rejected the “ global war on terrorism , ” he begrudgingly acknowledged that there was indeed a war , albeit it “ a different kind of war. ” Logically , this was a Rubicon he needed to cross to defend his use of drones to kill American citizens . Hypocritically , he used the war paradigm for the same reason Mr. Bush had — to defend a policy only palatable to the public in a time of war . While Mr. Bush had used the war paradigm to justify enhanced interrogation and the indefinite detention of enemy combatants , Mr. Obama used it to justify the outright killing without legal review .
Having himself employed the war paradigm , Mr. Obama tried to pull it back by calling on Congress to declare victory , thus ending the war . Congress could do this by revoking the 12-year-old Authorization of the Use of Military Force and by allowing the transfer of additional detainees from Guantanamo to their home countries . This request creates new problems for the president , though . First , how can he justify his continued use of drones if the war is now over ? He finessed this by setting new standards for using drones against Americans . The logic was flawed , however . If there is no war , then the right to due process shouldn ’ t be suspended . A tighter presidential review is no substitute .
Second , the president ’ s narrative contradicts the reality that has become all too familiar . With the vicious attack on American soldiers at Fort Hood back in the news , the bombing at the Boston Marathon , and the recent bloody attacks in London and Paris , Mr. Obama ’ s declaration of victory defies logic . He may be the most gifted communicator in the Oval Office since Ronald Reagan , but even he can not sell such an implausible narrative .
Finally — and most importantly — the president has failed to develop a realistic alternative to the war paradigm . Rejecting the tribunal system , Mr. Obama promised to end indefinite detention and to bring the prisoners into the traditional criminal justice system . He also repeatedly promised to close Guantanamo Bay . These promises weren ’ t kept . Mr. Obama failed not because of a lack of effort , but because of the lack of suitable alternatives . His 2009 trial balloon to move the detainees to the Thomson Correctional Center in Illinois failed to gain popular backing and was abandoned . In 2010 , the administration dropped its proposal to hold trials for Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and other Sept. 11 conspirators in New York City when it drew anger from citizens and lawmakers alike . Most recently , his call to transfer Guantanamo Bay detainees to their countries of origin lacks congressional backing . Conservatives oppose it largely because of the high recidivism rate , in excess of 30 percent , among those previously returned .

In an effort that was once ideological and has now deteriorated into semantics, President Obama refuses to use the phrase “global war on terrorism.” While Mr. Obama’s linguistic acrobatics sometimes seem silly or even petty, they have a purpose. Candidate Obama banned the phrase to signal to progressives his visceral condemnation of the tactics George W. Bush had used in the “war” paradigm to justify. He rejected the use of enhanced interrogation, labeled “torture” the indefinite detention of “enemy combatants,” and proscribed trial by military tribunals. Instead, Mr. Obama contended that terrorism was a particularly heinous form of crime and required no deviation from the civilian criminal justice system. With the terrorism-as-crime paradigm, one would seek the legal extradition of terrorists, arrest — not kill — them, hold them for trial in civilian courts, and sentence them to the existing penal system.

Mr. Obama’s May 23 speech to the National Defense University demonstrated his inability to develop an alternative to the war paradigm and to keep his promises to fundamentally alter the tactics. While he again rejected the “global war on terrorism,” he begrudgingly acknowledged that there was indeed a war, albeit it “a different kind of war.” Logically, this was a Rubicon he needed to cross to defend his use of drones to kill American citizens. Hypocritically, he used the war paradigm for the same reason Mr. Bush had — to defend a policy only palatable to the public in a time of war. While Mr. Bush had used the war paradigm to justify enhanced interrogation and the indefinite detention of enemy combatants, Mr. Obama used it to justify the outright killing without legal review.

Having himself employed the war paradigm, Mr. Obama tried to pull it back by calling on Congress to declare victory, thus ending the war. Congress could do this by revoking the 12-year-old Authorization of the Use of Military Force and by allowing the transfer of additional detainees from Guantanamo to their home countries. This request creates new problems for the president, though. First, how can he justify his continued use of drones if the war is now over? He finessed this by setting new standards for using drones against Americans. The logic was flawed, however. If there is no war, then the right to due process shouldn’t be suspended. A tighter presidential review is no substitute.

Second, the president’s narrative contradicts the reality that has become all too familiar. With the vicious attack on American soldiers at Fort Hood back in the news, the bombing at the Boston Marathon, and the recent bloody attacks in London and Paris, Mr. Obama’s declaration of victory defies logic. He may be the most gifted communicator in the Oval Office since Ronald Reagan, but even he cannot sell such an implausible narrative.

Finally — and most importantly — the president has failed to develop a realistic alternative to the war paradigm. Rejecting the tribunal system, Mr. Obama promised to end indefinite detention and to bring the prisoners into the traditional criminal justice system. He also repeatedly promised to close Guantanamo Bay. These promises weren’t kept. Mr. Obama failed not because of a lack of effort, but because of the lack of suitable alternatives. His 2009 trial balloon to move the detainees to the Thomson Correctional Center in Illinois failed to gain popular backing and was abandoned. In 2010, the administration dropped its proposal to hold trials for Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and other Sept. 11 conspirators in New York City when it drew anger from citizens and lawmakers alike. Most recently, his call to transfer Guantanamo Bay detainees to their countries of origin lacks congressional backing. Conservatives oppose it largely because of the high recidivism rate, in excess of 30 percent, among those previously returned. Moreover, those remaining at Guantanamo are the most hardened cases. Even some on the left have concerns with the concept. When the Bush administration used extraordinary rendition to send suspected terrorists, such as Abu Omar, back to their country of origin, torture sometimes resulted.

In sum, after years of ideologically driven effort, Mr. Obama has failed to produce a practical — or politically viable — alternative to the Bush paradigm of the “global war on terrorism.” Instead, the tribunal system goes unused, indefinite detention continues, and suspected terrorists — even American ones — are killed without due process, or even the benefits of interrogation, enhanced or otherwise. Verbal acrobatics aside, suspending the use of the term hasn’t brought an end to the reality.

The Pentagon set out three broad groups of targets arranged in an arc across northern Syria.

Those closest to the Mediterranean coast seem to have been hit largely by Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from warships - this is an area where Syrian government air defences may still have coverage.

In a briefing Lt Gen William Mayville noted that Syrian air defences were ""passive"", as he put it, during the course of the operation.

This suggests a conscious decision by Syrian commanders who perhaps feared that active scanning by their defences might draw down air attacks upon them.

The operation was notable for involving aircraft from Jordan and from Washington's Gulf allies. It also marked the first use in combat of one of the USAF's most modern aircraft, the F-22 Raptor.

This, the Pentagon is stressing, is just the start of ""a sustained air campaign"", the tempo of which, says a Pentagon spokesman, ""will be dictated by facts on the ground"".

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (Photo: AFP) Story Highlights A number of suicide bombers become radicalized in their late teens.

Most eventual terrorists will actually start to integrate fairly well - like the rest of us.

The most dangerous mindset known to mankind is that of the victim.

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was only 19 years old when he allegedly planned and carried out one of the worst acts of terror on U.S. soil since 9/11. This, however, is actually not an uncommon age for radicalization. In fact, a number of suicide bombers and terrorist convicts were radicalized about the same age. Hasib Hussain, for example, one of the London 7/7 bombers of 2005, was 18. This is when any existential wound that has been festering since childhood is most vulnerable to external forces.

Radical Islamist ideology is a poison disguised as a cure. In the research I conducted across a range of terror cells, I found that the seeds of their heinous crimes were planted all the way back in their childhoods, and the work I have done since with unsuccessful (convicted) terrorists has only confirmed this.

Identity crisis

The problem starts as a crisis of identity. We all rely on various dimensions of the environment around us to help develop a sense of who we are. The first is our parents, and we depend on their nurturing and connection to develop the initial layer in our sense of self.

Most suicide bombers lacked a close intimate relationship, particularly with their same-sex parent. Mohammed Atta, leader of the 9/11 bombers, had a father who was so strict that he timed his son's journey from school to home, and if he arrived a minute late the father would beat him. There was no time for play, friendship, leisure or just being. Everything had to be about work, study and progress.

Of course, millions of people have controlling parents. Each step along the way, however, narrows the numbers down. The next step is the attempt to fill in the identity gap of the infant years with attachment to wider society. For an immigrant, this can be difficult. Most eventual terrorists actually start to integrate fairly well, like the rest of us. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the older marathon bombing suspect, had married fellow Boston student Katherine Russell.

This initial blossoming of a sense of self is precarious, and any real or perceived slight can knock it off course. Such a derailment often happens at the age when one starts to develop independence, leave home and enter tentatively into the realm of adulthood. And this is precisely when the canny recruiter strikes. It is not a coincidence that university campuses around Europe are sometimes seen as hotbeds of extremist recruitment. This is when a radical preacher knows that his prey is at its most vulnerable.

Yes, you are different, the rejected youth is told. But you are different for a reason. You are a chosen one. You will join the ranks of a hallowed few at the forefront of a cosmic struggle between good and evil. This way, the deflated ego is pumped up. Shame and humiliation are converted into pride and honor, and for the first time in his life, the young man starts to feel good about who he is. Really good. This is the poison disguised as a cure. One so toxic, it will ultimately take his own life as well as that of yet to be determined numbers of innocent others.

Fuel of anger

Like a noose, the community of ""the elite"" constrict around the radicalized youth. A sense of righteous anger is stoked within and cherished as if it were the most precious fuel, for, in a way, that is what it is. This is the fuel that will power the weapon of hate that he is becoming. If appropriately channeled by the ideology, the weapon he becomes will be a precision-guided one, directed specifically at the target: the Western world that is supposedly at war with Islam.

That anger comes from giving the young man the most dangerous mindset known to mankind, that of the victim. It colors the lens through which he sees the world relentlessly till he can see only darkness. If he believes himself to be enough of a victim, then he'll feel as if he has nothing to lose.

Victimhood is the opposite energy to gratitude. And it is this message that the terrorist unconsciously wants to pass on to us. He wants us to see the world in the same black-and-white way he does. He wants us to taste some of his own medicine by seeing ourselves as victims in a world that is essentially dangerous, unjust and bad. That way, we will then join with him in conflict and convert the fantasy his imagination has fed on into a reality.

But every time we show compassion, he fails. Every time we are grateful for what we have, for the people who care for and rescue us and for the richness of the diversity we live in, he loses.

The battle against terrorism is waged on many levels: from the detection and apprehension of the recruiters, online and offline, to the location and destruction of the training camps. At least as important as all this is the battle that is waged within, the battle to remain connected to the innocence, awe and uncorrupted beauty we all possessed as children and that remains somewhere deep down inside today, whatever our transgressions.

To reject the ideology of hatred, we must reject its psychology, too. Understanding those who hate us is the best way to neutralize them. Let's hope we will learn more about who Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is and how his life took the tragic and awful path — for all concerned — that it did.

Devens , Mass. , '' U.S . Marshals Service spokesman Drew Wade said in a statement emailed to reporters Friday morning .
`` The Federal Medical Center ( FMC ) Devens is an administrative facility housing male offenders requiring specialized or long-term medical or mental health care . FMC Devens also has a satellite camp housing minimum security male inmates . `` FMC Devens is located in north central Massachusetts , approximately 39 miles west of Boston and 20 miles north of Worcester , on the decommissioned military base of Fort Devens . ''
Tsarnaev , 19 , is being treated for injuries he received sometime last Friday during either a gun battle with police in Watertown , Mass. , or when authorities opened fire on the boat he was found hiding in there . He 's said to be in fair condition . The other suspect in the bombings that killed three people and injured more than 200 , as well as the subsequent murder of a MIT police officer and shooting of a Boston area transit officer , was 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev . He was Dzhokhar 's brother . Tamerlan Tsarnaev died last Friday from injuries he received during that gun battle in Watertown .
From WBUR : `` Setting The Record Straight On Evolving Manhunt Details . ''
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction .
The statement from the Marshals Service did not say when Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was moved out of the hospital . But New England Cable News reports that `` at about 3:00 am Friday morning , Boston and state police seemed to have left Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center . ''
Victims of the bombings are being treated at Beth Israel Deaconess . As we noted Wednesday , some of those patients and their families had been upset that the suspect was there .
Among the morning 's other stories about the bombings and their aftermath , is this piece from The Boston Globe : `` Carjack Victim Recounts His Harrowing Night . ''
Identified only as `` Danny , '' the man who says it was his SUV that the suspects carjacked on April 18 adds more harrowing details to the story ( as we wrote earlier this week , he had previously spoken with New Hampshire 's WMUR-TV ) .
The Globe writes that Danny 's 90-minute encounter with the suspects began when a man rapped on his SUV 's passenger side window :
`` Danny , unable to hear him , lowered the window — and the man reached an arm through , unlocked the door , and climbed in , brandishing a silver handgun. `` 'Do n't be stupid , ' he told Danny . He asked if he had followed the news about Monday 's Boston Marathon bombings . Danny had , down to the release of the grainy suspect photos less than six hours earlier. `` ' I did that , ' said the man , who would later be identified as Tamerlan Tsarnaev . 'And I just killed a policeman in Cambridge . ' ``
Danny got away from the suspects , he says , when they had to stop at a gas station because the SUV was low on gas . A sign there said `` cash only . '' The Globe writes that :
`` When the younger brother , Dzhokhar , was forced to go inside the Shell Food Mart to pay , older brother Tamerlan put his gun in the door pocket to fiddle with a navigation device — letting his guard down briefly after a night on the run . Danny then did what he had been rehearsing in his head . In a flash , he unbuckled his seat belt , opened the door , stepped through , slammed it behind , and sprinted off at an angle that would be a hard shot for any marksman . ''

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the surviving suspect in the April 15 Boston Marathon bombings and the crimes that followed, has been moved out of Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center ""and is now confined at the Bureau of Prisons facility FMC Devens at Ft. Devens, Mass.,"" U.S. Marshals Service spokesman Drew Wade said in a statement emailed to reporters Friday morning.

According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons:

""The Federal Medical Center (FMC) Devens is an administrative facility housing male offenders requiring specialized or long-term medical or mental health care. FMC Devens also has a satellite camp housing minimum security male inmates. ""FMC Devens is located in north central Massachusetts, approximately 39 miles west of Boston and 20 miles north of Worcester, on the decommissioned military base of Fort Devens.""

Tsarnaev, 19, is being treated for injuries he received sometime last Friday during either a gun battle with police in Watertown, Mass., or when authorities opened fire on the boat he was found hiding in there. He's said to be in fair condition. The other suspect in the bombings that killed three people and injured more than 200, as well as the subsequent murder of a MIT police officer and shooting of a Boston area transit officer, was 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev. He was Dzhokhar's brother. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died last Friday from injuries he received during that gun battle in Watertown.

From WBUR: ""Setting The Record Straight On Evolving Manhunt Details.""

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction.

The statement from the Marshals Service did not say when Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was moved out of the hospital. But New England Cable News reports that ""at about 3:00 am Friday morning, Boston and state police seemed to have left Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.""

Victims of the bombings are being treated at Beth Israel Deaconess. As we noted Wednesday, some of those patients and their families had been upset that the suspect was there.

Among the morning's other stories about the bombings and their aftermath, is this piece from The Boston Globe: ""Carjack Victim Recounts His Harrowing Night.""

Identified only as ""Danny,"" the man who says it was his SUV that the suspects carjacked on April 18 adds more harrowing details to the story (as we wrote earlier this week, he had previously spoken with New Hampshire's WMUR-TV).

The Globe writes that Danny's 90-minute encounter with the suspects began when a man rapped on his SUV's passenger side window:

""Danny, unable to hear him, lowered the window — and the man reached an arm through, unlocked the door, and climbed in, brandishing a silver handgun. "" 'Don't be stupid,' he told Danny. He asked if he had followed the news about Monday's Boston Marathon bombings. Danny had, down to the release of the grainy suspect photos less than six hours earlier. "" 'I did that,' said the man, who would later be identified as Tamerlan Tsarnaev. 'And I just killed a policeman in Cambridge.' ""

Danny got away from the suspects, he says, when they had to stop at a gas station because the SUV was low on gas. A sign there said ""cash only."" The Globe writes that:

""When the younger brother, Dzhokhar, was forced to go inside the Shell Food Mart to pay, older brother Tamerlan put his gun in the door pocket to fiddle with a navigation device — letting his guard down briefly after a night on the run. Danny then did what he had been rehearsing in his head. In a flash, he unbuckled his seat belt, opened the door, stepped through, slammed it behind, and sprinted off at an angle that would be a hard shot for any marksman.""

During the Sunni Awakening of 2008 , American troops had successfully nurtured tribal councils and militias as partners to eject murderous insurgents from their homeland in western Iraq .
Al Qaeda in Iraq failed because of its “ brutality , zealotry , and arrogant belief that it was a state , ” said critics – both jihadi and non-jihadi – according to Will McCants , director of the Project on US Relations with the Islamic World at the Brookings Institution in Washington .
So what did the Islamic State do ? It doubled down .
By 2014 , “ those were the very qualities that made the Islamic State so successful , ” says Dr. McCants , author of the new book , “ The ISIS Apocalypse . ”
It is well known that the Islamic State is now governing a wide swath of Syria and Iraq through a modern-day reign of terror . What is less well-known is why that approach has been so successful – even attracting tens of thousands of foreigners .
The answer appears to be in how that brutality takes shape .
Toward local populations that have little choice but to obey , the Islamic State can promise – and carry out – untold savagery . On Sunday , the Islamic State killed some 70 members of a tribe in Iraq that had tried to rise up against the group . To the foreign fighters who pledge their lives to the cause , by contrast , the Islamic State promises lakeside homes in Raqqa , Syria , and high salaries .
The campaign of fear and intimidation that hangs over locals works largely because there are no other options . Sunni Muslims in IS-held territory trust the Syrian and Iraqi governments – which are run by other religious groups – even less than they trust the Islamic State . And no foreign power is likely to step in and tip the power balance toward local tribes , as the US did in the Sunni Awakening .
The result is a pseudo-state that breaks all the modern rules – governing through a very calculated mix of opportunism and oppression .
“ It was a tough thing for me to see , because I had bought into the idea , put around by the western analytical community – but also by [ former Al Qaeda leader Osama ] bin Laden himself – that if you ’ re going to wage an insurgency and create a long-lasting state , you need to win over popular support , ” says McCants .
For all its wanton spectacle , the brutality of the Islamic State is not random . It is part of a carefully calibrated state-building strategy that the group has been ramping up for years .
The group ’ s approach to establish control “ began with infiltration and ended with conquest , ” as a Rand Corporation report released this month put it . “ Time after time , place after place , the group would establish an intelligence and security apparatus , target key opponents , and establish extortion and other criminal revenue-raising practices , ” it noted . “ Clandestine campaigns of assassination and intimidation have been part of the group ’ s playbook for more than a decade . ”
Reports from groups on the ground , as well as social media , show that “ ISIS does rely on brutality much more than Al Qaeda , ” says Harleen Gambhir , a counterterrorism analyst with the Institute for the Study of War , using a common acronym for the Islamic State . This includes “ intentionally inspiring terror , pushing the bounds so that it can intimidate those under its control . ”
Sunday ’ s slaughter was a typical example , Ms. Gambhir says . “ These sorts of mass executions come frequently for those even vaguely hinting at rebellion . ”
This summer , an uprising in Libya was brutally put down by an IS affiliate , which “ mass executed those in local tribes , ” she adds . This in turn “ eliminated all hints of social rebellion . ”
What the Islamic State has shown is that , in the short term , “ brutality … can be much more effective than worrying about others , ” McCants says . “ If you look at what IS has done , you can see examples where control has been established by extreme brutality and kept up by extreme brutality . ”
The question is whether the Islamic State can maintain such a state over the long term . Al Qaeda has long argued that its vision of establishing an Islamic caliphate is more sustainable .
“ It thinks ISIS is going to burn out , because of the way it treats locals , ” Gambhir says .
The Islamic State instead has put a priority on bringing in foreign fighters .
“ ISIS fighters … are given preference in obtaining food and basic needs of living , ” she adds .
There are clear signs that locals are chafing mightily under Islamic State rule , says McCants . But “ unless they get help from the outside , ” they are going to have trouble throwing off the group .
That help is not likely to come from the US . “ I have no doubt we could do it , should we choose to , ” says McCants , but such an operation would necessarily include troops on the ground and embroil the US in the Middle East again .
Moreover , it would “ let the local governments off the hook , ” especially in Damascus and Baghdad , McCants says . As a result , the problems that allowed the rise of the Islamic State in the first place , including Sunni disenfranchisement by Shiite-dominate governments , would continue .
“ This leaves us in the unsatisfying position of not having terrific options in the near term for destroying the IS , ” McCants says .
In some ways , the US might have more options in Syria , McCants says , because it is not working with the government . “ Syria is always seen as the hard case , but we also have greater freedom of choice . ”
The US could work with Kurdish forces to clear areas , then build up local Sunni militias to hold them . Yet Turkish officials balk at the idea of empowering Kurdish forces , given the large Kurdish minority in Turkey .
As in 2008 , the most promising center of gravity for the fight against the Islamic State is the Sunni tribes . “ Many Sunnis support the group either because of intimidation or because they view it as their only protection against other groups , ” the Rand report notes . “ Although this will be difficult , Iraq , at least , can start by ensuring fair treatment of the population when towns are recovered , and by speeding the reconstruction of those towns . ”
The question becomes how to empower them , given the limited tools the US has at its disposal .

“The Islamic State has done the exact opposite.”

Violence, but not random

For all its wanton spectacle, the brutality of the Islamic State is not random. It is part of a carefully calibrated state-building strategy that the group has been ramping up for years.

The group’s approach to establish control “began with infiltration and ended with conquest,” as a Rand Corporation report released this month put it. “Time after time, place after place, the group would establish an intelligence and security apparatus, target key opponents, and establish extortion and other criminal revenue-raising practices,” it noted. “Clandestine campaigns of assassination and intimidation have been part of the group’s playbook for more than a decade.”

The Islamic State instead has put a priority on bringing in foreign fighters.

“ISIS fighters … are given preference in obtaining food and basic needs of living,” she adds.

Sunni Awakening, Part 2?

There are clear signs that locals are chafing mightily under Islamic State rule, says McCants. But “unless they get help from the outside,” they are going to have trouble throwing off the group.

That help is not likely to come from the US. “I have no doubt we could do it, should we choose to,” says McCants, but such an operation would necessarily include troops on the ground and embroil the US in the Middle East again.

President Obama is on his way out, and not a minute too soon. The legacy he obsesses over continues to expand in revealing ways. It may not be exactly what he thinks he’s leaving, and it’s more legacy than he wants.

The terrorists of ISIS, whom the president famously derided as “the junior varsity,” a ragtime army not to worry about, have metastasized throughout the Middle East and Europe on his watch, and may be coming soon to a neighborhood near you.

ISIS and other terrorist groups have largely abandoned attempts to put together spectaculars like Sept. 11, and are focusing now on “a new landscape,” where lone killers, empowered by the technology of the digital age, can strike with smaller-scale massacres.

The radicals, who are evil but not dumb, quickly recognized that the American president thinks a nice speech is the equal of an AK-47 or a beheading knife, and were freed to act accordingly.

Mr. Obama’s small stick and soft words comprised the marching music of the president’s retreat from the world. But the rules changed and the president did not seem to notice. Last month, in a speech to the U.S. Central Command and the U.S. Operations Command, the president raised a toast to himself for his counter-terrorism efforts. No “group,” he said, has launched a “complex plot” from abroad during his eight years in the White House.

Technically true, perhaps, with all the caveats and qualifiers — “group,” “complex plot,” “from abroad” — but with Christmas massacres in San Bernardino and summer assaults on revelers in Orlando, the forces of Islamic jihad needed no complex plots and abducted airliners. A depraved man with a gun would do.

And that’s just in the United States. The threat of radical Islam — the enemy of all that is wise and both secular and holy in the West — is expanding everywhere. ISIS and its like strike whenever it can and wherever the innocent are having a good time, a Christmas market in Berlin, a New Year’s Eve party in Istanbul, a theater on the Riviera.

This is what the National Counter-Terrorism Center calls “the new landscape … with few formal boundaries or solid structures, where groups can form wherever resources permit and circumstances are favorable. It is also one in which technology may permit active militants in the future to become individual terror-broadcasting units, cataloging their path to terror and teaching others their tradecraft.”

ISIS sprouted from the corpse of al Qaeda, the defeated terrorist remnant, and since no one was looking quickly grew to an army in Syria, and when still no one way paying attention, grew into a force that could invade Iraq two years ago. ISIS cleverly choreographed the brutality it inflicted on the land, and exploited media technology to put its message on social media and in other effective places.

“The modern terrorist acts more often than not without detailed operational guidance from a central authority like [al Qaeda and ISIS,” says Robert Maginnis, author of a new book, “Future War.” Such terrorists “take general encouragement from public pronouncements of their ideological leaders.”

A junior varsity succeeds best when nobody’s looking. That’s the legacy of Barack Obama.

The style of attack and the target suggested Islamic extremism, he said.

A vigil has been held at the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, right next to the scene of the attack.

The man detained, who has denied involvement, arrived in Germany from Pakistan at the end of last year. He was captured in a park after reportedly fleeing the scene.

Before attending the vigil, German Chancellor Angela Merkel vowed to punish those responsible for the attack ""as harshly as the law requires"".

How has Germany responded to the attack?

Chancellor Merkel expressed her concern that the attacker might turn out to be an asylum seeker.

""I know that it would be particularly difficult for us all to bear if it turned out that the person who committed this act was someone who sought protection and asylum in Germany,"" she said.

The co-leader of Germany's anti-immigration AfD party, Frauke Petry, blamed Mrs Merkel's liberal policy on migrants.

""The milieu in which such acts can flourish has been negligently and systematically imported over the past year and a half,"" she said.

Horst Seehofer, the leader of Mrs Merkel's sister party in Bavaria, urged the chancellor ""to rethink our immigration and security policy and to change it"".

Is this attack unprecedented?

Monday's incident mirrored the lorry attack on Bastille Day crowds in the French city of Nice on 14 July, claimed by so-called Islamic State (IS).

A year of terror in Germany

Both IS and al-Qaeda have urged their followers to use vehicles as a means to attack crowds.

At the end of 2014, a van was driven into pedestrians at a Christmas market in the French city of Nantes, injuring 10 people.

Last week, German prosecutors said a 12-year-old German-Iraqi boy was in custody on suspicion of plotting to blow up a Christmas market in the western town of Ludwigshafen.",www.bbc.com,center,aQI9jOfARqJ8Z8nF

The gruesome , videotaped immolation of the Muslim pilot shows the Islamic State terrorists are stepping up their reign of death , torture and other inhumane acts that only belatedly have drawn a forceful response from a world that , in many cases , seemed to view the threat as isolated to a region .

The heinous acts of Islamic State terrorists poise a challenge to the world ’ s nations to end the threat or suffer the consequences of inaction and ineffectiveness . President Obama , who allowed the Islamic State terrorists to grow into a formidable fighting force without much response until they began routinely committing atrocities , since then has learned the group ’ s evil acts have no bounds .
“ Know also that we will cut off your head in the White House , and transform America into a Muslim Province , ” an Islamic State terrorist said as he referred to President Obama during a recent videotaped execution of a captured Kurdish fighter .
The same terrorist also threatened the people of European nations , saying , “ We will come to you with car bombs and explosive charges , and will cut off your heads . ”
Islamic State terrorists ’ recent killing of Jordanian pilot Lt. Muath al-Kaseasbeh , as well as the beheading of two American journalists , two Japanese citizens , two British aid workers and an American aid worker who became Muslim in captivity should jolt people around the world . The tentacles of Islamic State – a radical al-Qaeda offshoot also called ISIS and ISIL – reach far and wide to imperil the safety and security of people in distant places .
The Islamic State terrorists , also known derogatorily as Daesh among many Muslims in the Middle East who are appalled by the group ’ s inhumane acts , seem to have based part of their economic survival on collecting ransoms for kidnapping Western hostages . But the U.S. government has refused to pay ransoms to avoid funding future atrocities and other violent acts by the terrorists , who also recruit foreigners to join them with promises of jobs for doctors , oilfield workers and engineers .
Outrage about the killing of the Jordanian pilot resounded particularly in the Arab region , with the United Arab Emirates opting to rejoin the coalition ’ s airstrikes on the Islamic State terrorists after previously suspending involvement after the airman ’ s initial capture .
In the wake of the confirmed death of Kayla Mueller , a 26-year-old U.S. aid worker kidnapped and held captive by Islamic State terrorists , Jordan ’ s information minister , Mohammad al-Momani , said “ Jordan strongly condemns the brutal killing of the American hostage . We express our sincere grief and are deeply angered by this barbaric brutality . Countries around the world must continue to work together to fight and defeat this evil . ”
In a taped message during a recent visit to Washington , Jordan ’ s King Abdullah II , called Islamic State a “ cowardly gang ” with “ no connection to our noble religion , ” Islam .
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said on Sunday , Feb. 22 , that a united Arab thrust is needed to counter the Islamic State group .
“ The need for a unified Arab force is growing and becoming more pressing every day , ” Sisi said .
Egypt recently struck Islamic State targets aerially in Libya to mark the government ’ s first military operation outside its borders in decades .
The terrorists have murdered thousands of people , including women and children , who sought to live in peace in the Middle East . Opportunities for normal commerce , economic growth , job creation , safe neighborhoods and freedom of religion have been torched by Islamic State much the way it martyred the Jordanian pilot .
In late February , Islamic State terrorists took 262 Assyrian Christians , including men , women , children and the elderly , from their communities as hostages . Based on the terrorists ’ past behavior , fears are high that those held captive could be executed or sold into slavery .
