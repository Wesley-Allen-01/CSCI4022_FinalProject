In 2019 we have Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who embraces windmills and announced a $16.3 trillion proposal Thursday for a Green New Deal, saying it would pay for itself in 16 years by generating increased tax revenue.

Don Quixote’s beliefs made a lot more sense.

SANDERS RELEASES $16 TRILLION ‘GREEN NEW DEAL’ PLAN, PROMISES IT WILL ‘PAY FOR ITSELF’

Even the deranged fictional character didn’t think he could overturn the laws of physics and economics, as Sanders seems to believe.

The 1965 play and 1972 film about Don Quixote were titled “Man of La Mancha” and featured a song called “The Impossible Dream.” That would be the perfect campaign theme song for the man of Vermont in his battle to win the Democratic nomination for president.

Sanders said Thursday that his plan is designed to battle climate change. But a thorough reading of the document makes it clear that the real goal of the proposal by the self-described democratic socialist is a Big Government takeover of America’s economy.

That’s because the real root of climate change for environmental extremists and socialist radicals like Sanders goes much deeper than our actions and lifestyle choices. They believe our free-market economic system and America itself are at fault – and think a second American Revolution is needed.

Sanders’ plan calls for a complete transition to electric vehicles and green energy by 2030. This deadline is impossible – not because of opposition by the “evil” fossil fuel industry that Sanders demonizes, but because of physics.

As the old saying goes, “facts are stubborn things.” Sanders can’t simply wish them away, nor can anyone else.

So let’s look at a few facts

Does Sanders know that fertilizers and pesticides come from fossil fuels? Will they become illegal, tremendously reducing crop production? Is mass starvation a price worth paying to end the use of fossil fuels?

One of the largest wind farms in the world is in Texas, and it generates about 800 megawatts of electricity each day. The farm takes up 100,000 acres of land the might otherwise be used to grow crops.

During the hottest days of the year, with peak air conditioning use, Texans consume over 70,000 megawatts of electricity daily. We can draw a conclusion: there isn’t enough land in Texas to build windmills to power everything in the state. Not unless we start seizing private land, as happened after the Russian Revolution, the Chinese Revolution and the Cuban Revolution.

It’s the same physics conundrum with solar panels: renewables do not generate enough power, given how much land they require.

So a question for Sanders: Which Texans turn off the air conditioning? Does the state decide? Is air conditioning even legal?

Physics eludes the Sanders proposal, as does logic. Each wind turbine requires 900 tons of steel and 2,500 tons of concrete. Steel is forged in the heat generated by coal. Concrete’s main ingredient is coal. Under the Sanders Green New Deal, coal and all fossil fuels would be taxed into oblivion and then made illegal.

Bottom line: you can’t build wind turbines if you abolish coal. If we are going to burn coal to make windmills, why not just burn coal to make electricity?

Airplanes cannot run on renewable energy. Electricity does not generate the thrust needed for planes to get airborne. If fossil fuels are eliminated by 2030 – as Sanders proposes – what happens to the airline industry?

Do we ship all goods via the sea? Does Sanders think cargo ships will run on batteries? Will he create a commercial nuclear fleet? No, nuclear power is slated for extinction along with fossil fuels under his version of the Green New Deal. And so too, apparently, is our economic prosperity.

And how do we get from our homes to our jobs, to go shopping, and everywhere else that we travel without fossil fuels? The 281 million cars, trucks, motorcycles and other vehicles that now travel U.S. roads would be useless without gasoline and diesel fuel, with the exception of the few that are electric vehicles.

Sanders proposes spending $2.2 trillion – which would have to come from your tax dollars – to help Americans buy electric vehicles (EVs). Last year Americans purchased about 400,000 EVs. That same year we purchased 17 million conventional vehicles.

We may have the capacity to manufacture enough EVs to meet the government-mandated demands, but what do the manufacturing plants run on? Wind and solar power? Those energy sources are almost twice as expensive as conventional energy.

And what about the materials needed to build all of those EVs? The steel currently forged by coal that is slated to be banned? The rare earth minerals that are mined by enormous earth-moving machines that can’t run on electricity? How do we transport EVs across the country without trucks that need a lot more power than electric motors can provide?

Now let’s look at food production. Farm equipment is monstrous and requires tremendous energy. Can it be retrofitted to run on batteries? Not yet.

So what happens in 2030 as our farmers plant and harvest crops without the current equipment? Think of what this will do to the cost of food. Plus, like EVs, there is a shipping problem. Should we go back to horse-drawn plows? But wait – all those horses will generate greenhouse gases and a tremendous amount of waste that will pollute the environment.

When Don Quixote tilted at windmills and made a fool of himself he didn’t hurt anyone. Proposals by Sanders, fellow democratic socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and others to adopt a Green New Deal that would eliminate all fossil fuels and make other revolutionary changes would hurt every American.

These proposals might sound good at first glance, but when looked at more closely they are crazier than Don Quixote’s delusions. They should not be taken seriously, much less supported.

environment,Victor Hanson,2,http://victorhanson.com/wordpress/?p=8890,OPINION: The Scorching of California,2015-12-22,Victor Davis Hanson,"In mid-December , the first large storms in three years drenched California . No one knows whether the rain and snow will continue—only that it must last for weeks if a record three-year drought , both natural and man-made , is to end . In the 1970s , coastal elites squelched California ’ s near-century-long commitment to building dams , reservoirs , and canals , even as the Golden State ’ s population ballooned . Court-ordered drainage of man-made lakes , meant to restore fish to the 1,100-square-mile Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta , partly caused central California ’ s reservoir water to dry up . Not content with preventing construction of new water infrastructure , environmentalists reverse-engineered existing projects to divert precious water away from agriculture , privileging the needs of fish over the needs of people . Then they alleged that global warming , not their own foolish policies , had caused the current crisis .
Even as a fourth year of drought threatens the state , canal water from the Hetch Hetchy reservoir in Yosemite National Park keeps Silicon Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area a verdant oasis . This parched coastal mountain range would have depopulated long ago without the infrastructure that an earlier , wiser generation built and that latter-day regulators and environmentalists so casually deprecated . ( See “ California ’ s Promethean Past , ” Summer 2013 . ) Gardens and lawns remain green in Palo Alto , San Mateo , Cupertino , and San Francisco , where residents continue to benefit from past investments in huge water transfers from inland mountains to the coast . They will be the last to go dry .
I grew up in the central San Joaquin Valley during the 1950s . In those days , some old-timers remembered with fondness when the undammed Kings River ’ s wild , white water would gush down into the sparsely populated valley . But most Californians never had such nostalgia . Past generations accepted that California was a growing state ( with some 20 million people by 1970 ) , that agriculture was its premier industry , and that the state fed not just its own people but millions across America and overseas . All of that required redistribution of water—and thus dams , reservoirs , and irrigation canals .
For 50 years , the state transferred surface water from northern California to the Central Valley through the California State Water Project and the federal Central Valley Project . Given these vast and ambitious initiatives , Californians didn ’ t worry much about the occasional one- or two-year drought or the steady growth in population . The postwar , can-do mentality resulted in a brilliantly engineered water system , far ahead of its time , that brought canal water daily from the 30 percent of the state where rain and snow were plentiful—mostly north of Sacramento as well as from the Sierra Nevada Mountains—to the lower , western , and warmer 70 percent of the state , where people preferred to work , farm , and live .
Everyone seemed to benefit . Floods in northern California became a thing of the past . The more than 40 major mountain reservoirs generated clean hydroelectric power . New lakes offered recreation for millions living in a once-arid state . Gravity-fed snowmelt was channeled into irrigation canals , opening millions of new acres to farming and ending reliance on pumping the aquifer . To most Californians , the irrigated , fertile Central Valley seemed a natural occurrence , not an environmental anomaly made possible only through the foresight of a now-forgotten generation of engineers and hydrologists .
Just as California ’ s freeways were designed to grow to meet increased traffic , the state ’ s vast water projects were engineered to expand with the population . Many assumed that the state would finish planned additions to the California State Water Project and its ancillaries . But in the 1960s and early 1970s , no one anticipated that the then-nascent environmental movement would one day go to court to stop most new dam construction , including the 14,000-acre Sites Reservoir on the Sacramento River near Maxwell ; the Los Banos Grandes facility , along a section of the California Aqueduct in Merced County ; and the Temperance Flat Reservoir , above Millerton Lake north of Fresno . Had the gigantic Klamath River diversion project not likewise been canceled in the 1970s , the resulting Aw Paw reservoir would have been the state ’ s largest man-made reservoir . At two-thirds the size of Lake Mead , it might have stored 15 million acre-feet of water , enough to supply San Francisco for 30 years . California ’ s water-storage capacity would be nearly double what it is today had these plans come to fruition . It was just as difficult to imagine that environmentalists would try to divert contracted irrigation and municipal water from already-established reservoirs . Yet they did just that , and subsequently moved to freeze California ’ s water-storage resources at 1970s capacities .
All the while , the Green activists remained blissfully unconcerned about the vast immigration into California from Latin America and Mexico that would help double the state ’ s population in just four decades , to 40 million . Had population growth remained static , perhaps California could have lived with partially finished water projects . The state might also have been able to restore the flow of scenic rivers from the mountains to the sea , maintained a robust agribusiness sector , and even survived a four- or five-year drought . But if California continues to block new construction of the State Water Project as well as additions to local and federal water-storage infrastructure , officials must halve California ’ s population , or shut down the 5 million acres of irrigated crops on the Central Valley ’ s west side , or cut back municipal water usage in a way never before done in the United States .
When the drought began in autumn 2011 , the average Californian barely noticed . Mountain reservoirs remained full throughout 2011 and much of 2012 , thanks to ample rainfall in previous years . Though rain and snowfall plunged to as much as 40 percent below average in most inland counties , shortages affected only large agribusiness conglomerates on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley—a small group of corporate grandees with plenty of land and little public sympathy .
During that first year of drought , quarrels over water were mostly confined to farmers and environmentalists . Confident that stored surface water in mountain reservoirs would remain plentiful , the Greens insisted that the state continue to divert reservoir water away from agricultural usage—at roughly the same rate as during pre-drought years—in order to replenish rivers . In practical terms , however , the diversions meant that substantial amounts of stored snowmelt were released from mountain dams and allowed to flow freely to the Pacific Ocean . Farmers called that wasted water ; environmentalists called it a return to a natural , preindustrial California . The Green dream was not simply river restoration and beautification , however . Bay Area environmentalists also believed that vastly increased freshwater inflows would help oxygenate the San Francisco Delta , thereby enabling the survival of the Delta smelt , a three-inch baitfish , while ensuring that salmon could be reintroduced into the San Joaquin River watershed .
Farmers mostly lost these early diversion battles . After all , the state ’ s reservoirs stood at or near capacity , previous wet years had recharged valley aquifers , and conventional wisdom held that the drought would probably end soon , anyway . Nevertheless , hand-painted protest signs began sprouting along Interstate 5 , amid a few abandoned almond orchards , proclaiming a new “ dust bowl ” and condemning liberal Bay Area officials , such as Representative Nancy Pelosi and Senator Barbara Boxer , for supporting the river diversions . In Fresno County , the Consolidated Irrigation District and others stopped almost all surface deliveries to their agricultural water users from the Pine Flat dam on the Kings River reservoir . The water masters of the Kings River had enough stored water at Pine Flat to keep the reservoir at mostly normal levels . By cutting off deliveries to farmers , authorities had the luxury of releasing water to refurbish the lower Kings River for habitat restoration .
I experienced the effects of these policies firsthand . My property contains a 130-year-old abandoned well that my great-great-grandparents dug by hand and lined with tin pipe . Throughout 2012 , the water table in my front yard remained about 40 feet below the surface , and all through the drought , the well proved a reliable barometer of changing groundwater levels . No one likes paying irrigation taxes for surface water not delivered , but local farmers shrugged , turned on their standby pumps , and drew from the shallow aquifer . We got by during the drought ’ s first year with only moderately elevated electricity bills . Fifty miles to the west , however , farmers and agribusinesses on the Central Valley ’ s west side resorted to drilling deeper , sometimes in excess of 1,500 feet . Pumping brackish water from great depths is an unsustainable way to irrigate millions of acres of valuable croplands . The entire 5 million-acre west-side agricultural project that arose from desert scrub didn ’ t exist before the early 1960s—precisely because the region had neither an aquifer nor a water project to deliver surface irrigation water from northern and eastern California .
As the drought continued , the political debate heated up . Farmers reminded Bay Area Greens that they had no proof that the Delta smelt was suffering from a lack of fresh river water . Equally likely culprits for the fish ’ s plight were the more than 30 Bay Area and Stockton-area municipalities that dump oxygen-depleted wastewater into the baitfish ’ s habitat . The farmers noted the irony of using artificial reservoirs to ensure supposedly “ natural ” year-round river flows for salmon and smelt . Before the construction of California ’ s modern dams , Sierra snowmelts didn ’ t necessarily ensure continually rushing rivers . Nineteenth-century spring floods into the valley usually were followed by a depleted late-summer Sierra snowpack and dry August river trickles . How odd , farmers thought , that environmentalists opposed new dams and reservoirs as “ unnatural , ” and yet counted on existing reservoir water to maintain a dependable habitat for newly introduced salmon . Before the dams , nature simply didn ’ t operate that way .
In the winter of 2012 , the drought entered its second year , but record-high agricultural commodity prices tempered the farmers ’ acrimony . Newly affluent customers in China and India—in addition to wealthy Japanese , Taiwanese , and South Korean consumers—fueled demand for premium California dairy products , wine , nuts and dried fruits , fresh fruits and vegetables , beef , and cotton . Raisin prices jumped from $ 900 per ton to more than $ 1,900 per ton . Some almond growers became millionaires overnight . When the per-pound price of nuts tripled , and new varieties of trees and new farming practices bolstered production to well over 3,000 pounds per acre , a once- “ inefficient ” family farmer with 40 acres could suddenly net $ 5,000 an acre . Given that harvesting almonds is mostly mechanized and requires little , if any , manual labor , growers embarked on planting sprees up and down the drought-stricken valley . If 40 acres could net $ 200,000 , large conglomerates of 5,000 acres or more might see profits of $ 25 million annually . Pistachios and walnuts proved even more lucrative . For the first time in a quarter-century , Central Valley farmers saw the kind of prosperity associated with the Silicon and Napa Valleys .
By 2013 , however , with snowfall scant , some northern California reservoirs had fallen far below normal levels . Farms on the Central Valley ’ s eastern side—the ones with prior privileged access to local irrigation districts and shallow water tables—faced a second year without surface-water deliveries . After 12 months of steady pumping , their water tables weren ’ t so shallow any more . My old well dipped to 60 feet as the water table began dropping more than a foot per month . In past years , I could count on access to canal water to replenish the water table . Now , for the first time in the 140-year history of our farm , nature and man had cut off the water . The well went dry .
Meanwhile , on the west side , state and local officials warned farmers that they might receive far less than even the 10 percent of contracted surface-water delivery that they ’ d been promised . Nevertheless , environmentalists prevailed upon the courts to extend orders diverting freshwater reserves from irrigation canals to rivers and the ocean . The public remained indifferent : the state had survived two years of drought before , and cities still got their water allotments from shrinking northern and mountain reservoirs . In 2012 and 2013 , man-made reservoirs in San Francisco and Los Angeles brimmed while the northern and mountain lakes that supplied them were just two-thirds full . Facing no threat of rationing , coastal Californians didn ’ t worry if a few hundred thousand acres of lucrative orchards simply shriveled up .
As 2013 wore on , climatologists , trying to project how long the drought might persist , warned state officials that their records only ran as far back as the late 1860s . California is a relatively new human habitat , and scientists can say little with certainty about the eons of natural history preceding the arrival of Spanish , Mexican , and American explorers . Tree-ring evidence suggests that past droughts had lasted 50 or even 100 years . Historically , drought may be the norm rather than the exception in California . This might explain why such a naturally rich state could support only a small population of indigenous people . Is coastal and central California , in its natural state , a mostly unsustainable desert for large , settled agrarian populations ? Maybe modern Californians don ’ t fully appreciate the genius of their forefathers , who were prescient enough to see that , if huge quantities of water weren ’ t transferred from the wet northlands , the Sierras , and the Colorado River , then the cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles would be little more than arid coastal villages , analogous to lightly populated and perennially water-short Cayucos or Cambria , along Highway 1 .
Californians heaved a sigh of relief after a few days of heavy rain in November 2013 , and some early snowfalls seemed to suggest that the drought would end in 2014 . But the relief was premature ; the dry spells returned . What rain and snow followed was too little and far too late . Even the snowpack in the American River watershed—a northern river system usually drawing on the greatest snowmelts—reached just 12 percent of its average . Soon , the huge man-made reservoirs in both the ordinarily wet north and the arid center of the state—Folsom , Millerton , New Melones , Orville Pine Flat , San Luis , Shasta , Trinity—dipped below half-full levels and , in some cases , plunged below 10 percent of capacity . By July 2014 , the average storage level of reservoirs statewide was 13 percent . Across the state , surface-irrigation deliveries to farms and orchards fell to near zero .
Farmers engaged in another vigorous round of groundwater pumping in summer 2014 . Water tables predictably plunged even further . Disaster struck the west side , as large agribusiness concerns drilled new wells to unheard-of depths of 2,000 feet and more , installing massive 300-horsepower electric pumps to bring up just enough brackish water to trickle over their thirsty crops . Panic ensued even on the east side , with its famous and once-shallow aquifer . Farmers complained about six-month-long waiting lists to deepen their wells . Instead of the usual 150- or 200-foot wells , farmers drilled to depths of 300 or 400 feet , and drew water from 150 feet . Pump installations were similarly backlogged , and pump sizes increased from the standard 15-horsepower models to 20- and 50-horsepower machines—all this to ensure that a farmer ’ s particular straw had the best chance of siphoning every last drop from an emptying common glass .
Such every-man-for-himself drilling came with its own attendant human foibles—bribing drillers to cut in front of the waiting list ; violating decade-old pump-sharing easements ; stealthily tapping into neighbors ’ pipeline systems ; or charging exorbitant rates to give dry farmers access to working wells . Well-rig manufacturers had trouble keeping up with demand . Some entrepreneurs , eager to gouge desperate farmers , sought drilling machinery on the East Coast and overseas . Meanwhile , farmers understood that , with the commodities boom , an investment in permanent trees and vines might represent $ 15,000– $ 20,000 per acre and annual profits of over $ 5,000 per year . By 2014 , keeping the orchard or vineyard alive , not just the current crop , became the aim . On the west side , some orchard owners began bulldozing older or less productive nut groves . Others tried to find just enough water to allow a final August or September harvest at record prices , before the exhausted trees were removed in the winter .
California ’ s huge urban reservoirs , however , remained full . Municipalities demanded that they receive all the final deliveries of state and federal surface water from the mountainous north and east . The Hetch Hetchy reservoir in Yosemite National Park still supplies almost 90 percent of the San Francisco Bay area ’ s daily water supplies . In a strange paradox , that water bypasses the San Joaquin River , into which environmentalists had diverted millions of acre-feet of irrigation water for fish . Even in 2014 , as the state baked dry , environmentalists insisted on diverting what little mountain reservoir water remained to river-restoration efforts . Yet no environmentalist group has suggested that California tap Hetch Hetchy for habitat restoration in the same manner in which it has expropriated the water of farmers .
By late 2014 , Pyramid and Castaic Lakes in southern California—part of the vast reserves controlled by the Southern California Metropolitan Water District—remained well above 90 percent of their capacities . But their sources in the distant north had almost no surface water left to give . The cities had drained and banked virtually all the state ’ s existing reservoirs . Indeed , so well banked are southern California ’ s project reservoirs that they have enough water to keep millions of customers well supplied through 2015 , even as northern and central California communities dry up .
In reaction to these ongoing disasters and fearing a fourth year of drought , the legislature and Governor Jerry Brown placed a $ 7.5 billion water bond on the November 2014 ballot . It passed , but only a third of the money will go to construction of reservoirs canceled in the 1970s and 1980s . Most of the bond ’ s provisions will fund huge new state bureaucracies to regulate access to groundwater and mandate recycling . The bond will essentially void more than a century of complex water law as the state moves to curb farmers ’ ability to pump water from beneath their own lands . Bay Area legislators who helped draft the bill failed to grasp that farmers bear the huge costs of drilling and pumping , not because they are greedy or insensitive to the environment but because the state ’ s population has doubled and its water infrastructure has not kept pace . A better way to regulate overdrafts of the water table would have been to increase vastly the amount of reservoir surface water for agriculture so that farmers would have no need to turn on their pumps . But legislators and policymakers let utopianism get in the way .
Last summer , my two agricultural pumps worked from June to late August to keep 40 acres of grapevines alive during 100-degree days . Electricity and pump maintenance are costly . So are the annual irrigation district taxes I ’ ve paid the last three years for contracted—though undelivered—surface water from the system that my great-grandfather and other pioneers built themselves with horse-drawn scrapers at the turn of the twentieth century . This winter , I added my name to the waiting list to lower the pump bowls—the impellers deep in the well that force the water up through the casing to the surface—in anticipation of another year of drought .
If the drought does continue , vast tracts of west-side farmlands will turn to dust . California ’ s nearly $ 30 billion agricultural export industry—led by dairy , almond , and grape production—is in grave peril . Its collapse would crush the economic livelihood of the Central Valley , especially its Hispanic community . When the 5 million-acre west side goes dry , hundreds of thousands of people will lose their jobs in a part of the state where the average unemployment rate already hovers above 10 percent . Farmers will spend hundreds of millions of dollars to deepen their wells further and save what water they can . Everything they and their predecessors have known for a century will be threatened with extinction .
Water is to California as coal is to Kentucky—yet its use is being curtailed by those least affected , if affected at all , by the consequences of their advocacy . But environmentalists , who for 40 years worked to undermine the prudent expansion of the state ’ s water infrastructure , have a rendezvous with those consequences soon . No reservoir water is left for them to divert—none for the reintroduction of their pet salmon , none for the Delta smelt . Their one hope is to claim possession of the water in the ground once they ’ ve exhausted what was above it . Redistribution , not expansion of supplies , is the liberal creed for water , just as it is for wealth .
As the Hetch Hetchy reservoir drains , Bay Area man-made storage lakes will necessarily follow . Another year of drought will deplete even southern California ’ s municipal reserves sooner rather than later . When Stanford professors and Cupertino tech lords can not take a shower and find themselves paving over their suburban lawns and gardens , perhaps they , too , will see the value of reservoir water for people rather than for fish . The new dust bowl may soon see a different generation of Joads abandoning California for a wetter—and more prosperous—Midwest .

By Victor Davis Hanson // City Journal

In mid-December, the first large storms in three years drenched California. No one knows whether the rain and snow will continue—only that it must last for weeks if a record three-year drought, both natural and man-made, is to end. In the 1970s, coastal elites squelched California’s near-century-long commitment to building dams, reservoirs, and canals, even as the Golden State’s population ballooned. Court-ordered drainage of man-made lakes, meant to restore fish to the 1,100-square-mile Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta, partly caused central California’s reservoir water to dry up. Not content with preventing construction of new water infrastructure, environmentalists reverse-engineered existing projects to divert precious water away from agriculture, privileging the needs of fish over the needs of people. Then they alleged that global warming, not their own foolish policies, had caused the current crisis.

Even as a fourth year of drought threatens the state, canal water from the Hetch Hetchy reservoir in Yosemite National Park keeps Silicon Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area a verdant oasis. This parched coastal mountain range would have depopulated long ago without the infrastructure that an earlier, wiser generation built and that latter-day regulators and environmentalists so casually deprecated. (See “California’s Promethean Past,” Summer 2013.) Gardens and lawns remain green in Palo Alto, San Mateo, Cupertino, and San Francisco, where residents continue to benefit from past investments in huge water transfers from inland mountains to the coast. They will be the last to go dry.

I grew up in the central San Joaquin Valley during the 1950s. In those days, some old-timers remembered with fondness when the undammed Kings River’s wild, white water would gush down into the sparsely populated valley. But most Californians never had such nostalgia. Past generations accepted that California was a growing state (with some 20 million people by 1970), that agriculture was its premier industry, and that the state fed not just its own people but millions across America and overseas. All of that required redistribution of water—and thus dams, reservoirs, and irrigation canals.

For 50 years, the state transferred surface water from northern California to the Central Valley through the California State Water Project and the federal Central Valley Project. Given these vast and ambitious initiatives, Californians didn’t worry much about the occasional one- or two-year drought or the steady growth in population. The postwar, can-do mentality resulted in a brilliantly engineered water system, far ahead of its time, that brought canal water daily from the 30 percent of the state where rain and snow were plentiful—mostly north of Sacramento as well as from the Sierra Nevada Mountains—to the lower, western, and warmer 70 percent of the state, where people preferred to work, farm, and live.

Everyone seemed to benefit. Floods in northern California became a thing of the past. The more than 40 major mountain reservoirs generated clean hydroelectric power. New lakes offered recreation for millions living in a once-arid state. Gravity-fed snowmelt was channeled into irrigation canals, opening millions of new acres to farming and ending reliance on pumping the aquifer. To most Californians, the irrigated, fertile Central Valley seemed a natural occurrence, not an environmental anomaly made possible only through the foresight of a now-forgotten generation of engineers and hydrologists.

Just as California’s freeways were designed to grow to meet increased traffic, the state’s vast water projects were engineered to expand with the population. Many assumed that the state would finish planned additions to the California State Water Project and its ancillaries. But in the 1960s and early 1970s, no one anticipated that the then-nascent environmental movement would one day go to court to stop most new dam construction, including the 14,000-acre Sites Reservoir on the Sacramento River near Maxwell; the Los Banos Grandes facility, along a section of the California Aqueduct in Merced County; and the Temperance Flat Reservoir, above Millerton Lake north of Fresno. Had the gigantic Klamath River diversion project not likewise been canceled in the 1970s, the resulting Aw Paw reservoir would have been the state’s largest man-made reservoir. At two-thirds the size of Lake Mead, it might have stored 15 million acre-feet of water, enough to supply San Francisco for 30 years. California’s water-storage capacity would be nearly double what it is today had these plans come to fruition. It was just as difficult to imagine that environmentalists would try to divert contracted irrigation and municipal water from already-established reservoirs. Yet they did just that, and subsequently moved to freeze California’s water-storage resources at 1970s capacities.

All the while, the Green activists remained blissfully unconcerned about the vast immigration into California from Latin America and Mexico that would help double the state’s population in just four decades, to 40 million. Had population growth remained static, perhaps California could have lived with partially finished water projects. The state might also have been able to restore the flow of scenic rivers from the mountains to the sea, maintained a robust agribusiness sector, and even survived a four- or five-year drought. But if California continues to block new construction of the State Water Project as well as additions to local and federal water-storage infrastructure, officials must halve California’s population, or shut down the 5 million acres of irrigated crops on the Central Valley’s west side, or cut back municipal water usage in a way never before done in the United States.

When the drought began in autumn 2011, the average Californian barely noticed. Mountain reservoirs remained full throughout 2011 and much of 2012, thanks to ample rainfall in previous years. Though rain and snowfall plunged to as much as 40 percent below average in most inland counties, shortages affected only large agribusiness conglomerates on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley—a small group of corporate grandees with plenty of land and little public sympathy.

During that first year of drought, quarrels over water were mostly confined to farmers and environmentalists. Confident that stored surface water in mountain reservoirs would remain plentiful, the Greens insisted that the state continue to divert reservoir water away from agricultural usage—at roughly the same rate as during pre-drought years—in order to replenish rivers. In practical terms, however, the diversions meant that substantial amounts of stored snowmelt were released from mountain dams and allowed to flow freely to the Pacific Ocean. Farmers called that wasted water; environmentalists called it a return to a natural, preindustrial California. The Green dream was not simply river restoration and beautification, however. Bay Area environmentalists also believed that vastly increased freshwater inflows would help oxygenate the San Francisco Delta, thereby enabling the survival of the Delta smelt, a three-inch baitfish, while ensuring that salmon could be reintroduced into the San Joaquin River watershed.

Farmers mostly lost these early diversion battles. After all, the state’s reservoirs stood at or near capacity, previous wet years had recharged valley aquifers, and conventional wisdom held that the drought would probably end soon, anyway. Nevertheless, hand-painted protest signs began sprouting along Interstate 5, amid a few abandoned almond orchards, proclaiming a new “dust bowl” and condemning liberal Bay Area officials, such as Representative Nancy Pelosi and Senator Barbara Boxer, for supporting the river diversions. In Fresno County, the Consolidated Irrigation District and others stopped almost all surface deliveries to their agricultural water users from the Pine Flat dam on the Kings River reservoir. The water masters of the Kings River had enough stored water at Pine Flat to keep the reservoir at mostly normal levels. By cutting off deliveries to farmers, authorities had the luxury of releasing water to refurbish the lower Kings River for habitat restoration.

I experienced the effects of these policies firsthand. My property contains a 130-year-old abandoned well that my great-great-grandparents dug by hand and lined with tin pipe. Throughout 2012, the water table in my front yard remained about 40 feet below the surface, and all through the drought, the well proved a reliable barometer of changing groundwater levels. No one likes paying irrigation taxes for surface water not delivered, but local farmers shrugged, turned on their standby pumps, and drew from the shallow aquifer. We got by during the drought’s first year with only moderately elevated electricity bills. Fifty miles to the west, however, farmers and agribusinesses on the Central Valley’s west side resorted to drilling deeper, sometimes in excess of 1,500 feet. Pumping brackish water from great depths is an unsustainable way to irrigate millions of acres of valuable croplands. The entire 5 million-acre west-side agricultural project that arose from desert scrub didn’t exist before the early 1960s—precisely because the region had neither an aquifer nor a water project to deliver surface irrigation water from northern and eastern California.

As the drought continued, the political debate heated up. Farmers reminded Bay Area Greens that they had no proof that the Delta smelt was suffering from a lack of fresh river water. Equally likely culprits for the fish’s plight were the more than 30 Bay Area and Stockton-area municipalities that dump oxygen-depleted wastewater into the baitfish’s habitat. The farmers noted the irony of using artificial reservoirs to ensure supposedly “natural” year-round river flows for salmon and smelt. Before the construction of California’s modern dams, Sierra snowmelts didn’t necessarily ensure continually rushing rivers. Nineteenth-century spring floods into the valley usually were followed by a depleted late-summer Sierra snowpack and dry August river trickles. How odd, farmers thought, that environmentalists opposed new dams and reservoirs as “unnatural,” and yet counted on existing reservoir water to maintain a dependable habitat for newly introduced salmon. Before the dams, nature simply didn’t operate that way.

In the winter of 2012, the drought entered its second year, but record-high agricultural commodity prices tempered the farmers’ acrimony. Newly affluent customers in China and India—in addition to wealthy Japanese, Taiwanese, and South Korean consumers—fueled demand for premium California dairy products, wine, nuts and dried fruits, fresh fruits and vegetables, beef, and cotton. Raisin prices jumped from $900 per ton to more than $1,900 per ton. Some almond growers became millionaires overnight. When the per-pound price of nuts tripled, and new varieties of trees and new farming practices bolstered production to well over 3,000 pounds per acre, a once-“inefficient” family farmer with 40 acres could suddenly net $5,000 an acre. Given that harvesting almonds is mostly mechanized and requires little, if any, manual labor, growers embarked on planting sprees up and down the drought-stricken valley. If 40 acres could net $200,000, large conglomerates of 5,000 acres or more might see profits of $25 million annually. Pistachios and walnuts proved even more lucrative. For the first time in a quarter-century, Central Valley farmers saw the kind of prosperity associated with the Silicon and Napa Valleys.

By 2013, however, with snowfall scant, some northern California reservoirs had fallen far below normal levels. Farms on the Central Valley’s eastern side—the ones with prior privileged access to local irrigation districts and shallow water tables—faced a second year without surface-water deliveries. After 12 months of steady pumping, their water tables weren’t so shallow any more. My old well dipped to 60 feet as the water table began dropping more than a foot per month. In past years, I could count on access to canal water to replenish the water table. Now, for the first time in the 140-year history of our farm, nature and man had cut off the water. The well went dry.

Meanwhile, on the west side, state and local officials warned farmers that they might receive far less than even the 10 percent of contracted surface-water delivery that they’d been promised. Nevertheless, environmentalists prevailed upon the courts to extend orders diverting freshwater reserves from irrigation canals to rivers and the ocean. The public remained indifferent: the state had survived two years of drought before, and cities still got their water allotments from shrinking northern and mountain reservoirs. In 2012 and 2013, man-made reservoirs in San Francisco and Los Angeles brimmed while the northern and mountain lakes that supplied them were just two-thirds full. Facing no threat of rationing, coastal Californians didn’t worry if a few hundred thousand acres of lucrative orchards simply shriveled up.

As 2013 wore on, climatologists, trying to project how long the drought might persist, warned state officials that their records only ran as far back as the late 1860s. California is a relatively new human habitat, and scientists can say little with certainty about the eons of natural history preceding the arrival of Spanish, Mexican, and American explorers. Tree-ring evidence suggests that past droughts had lasted 50 or even 100 years. Historically, drought may be the norm rather than the exception in California. This might explain why such a naturally rich state could support only a small population of indigenous people. Is coastal and central California, in its natural state, a mostly unsustainable desert for large, settled agrarian populations? Maybe modern Californians don’t fully appreciate the genius of their forefathers, who were prescient enough to see that, if huge quantities of water weren’t transferred from the wet northlands, the Sierras, and the Colorado River, then the cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles would be little more than arid coastal villages, analogous to lightly populated and perennially water-short Cayucos or Cambria, along Highway 1.

Californians heaved a sigh of relief after a few days of heavy rain in November 2013, and some early snowfalls seemed to suggest that the drought would end in 2014. But the relief was premature; the dry spells returned. What rain and snow followed was too little and far too late. Even the snowpack in the American River watershed—a northern river system usually drawing on the greatest snowmelts—reached just 12 percent of its average. Soon, the huge man-made reservoirs in both the ordinarily wet north and the arid center of the state—Folsom, Millerton, New Melones, Orville Pine Flat, San Luis, Shasta, Trinity—dipped below half-full levels and, in some cases, plunged below 10 percent of capacity. By July 2014, the average storage level of reservoirs statewide was 13 percent. Across the state, surface-irrigation deliveries to farms and orchards fell to near zero.

Farmers engaged in another vigorous round of groundwater pumping in summer 2014. Water tables predictably plunged even further. Disaster struck the west side, as large agribusiness concerns drilled new wells to unheard-of depths of 2,000 feet and more, installing massive 300-horsepower electric pumps to bring up just enough brackish water to trickle over their thirsty crops. Panic ensued even on the east side, with its famous and once-shallow aquifer. Farmers complained about six-month-long waiting lists to deepen their wells. Instead of the usual 150- or 200-foot wells, farmers drilled to depths of 300 or 400 feet, and drew water from 150 feet. Pump installations were similarly backlogged, and pump sizes increased from the standard 15-horsepower models to 20- and 50-horsepower machines—all this to ensure that a farmer’s particular straw had the best chance of siphoning every last drop from an emptying common glass.

Such every-man-for-himself drilling came with its own attendant human foibles—bribing drillers to cut in front of the waiting list; violating decade-old pump-sharing easements; stealthily tapping into neighbors’ pipeline systems; or charging exorbitant rates to give dry farmers access to working wells. Well-rig manufacturers had trouble keeping up with demand. Some entrepreneurs, eager to gouge desperate farmers, sought drilling machinery on the East Coast and overseas. Meanwhile, farmers understood that, with the commodities boom, an investment in permanent trees and vines might represent $15,000–$20,000 per acre and annual profits of over $5,000 per year. By 2014, keeping the orchard or vineyard alive, not just the current crop, became the aim. On the west side, some orchard owners began bulldozing older or less productive nut groves. Others tried to find just enough water to allow a final August or September harvest at record prices, before the exhausted trees were removed in the winter.

California’s huge urban reservoirs, however, remained full. Municipalities demanded that they receive all the final deliveries of state and federal surface water from the mountainous north and east. The Hetch Hetchy reservoir in Yosemite National Park still supplies almost 90 percent of the San Francisco Bay area’s daily water supplies. In a strange paradox, that water bypasses the San Joaquin River, into which environmentalists had diverted millions of acre-feet of irrigation water for fish. Even in 2014, as the state baked dry, environmentalists insisted on diverting what little mountain reservoir water remained to river-restoration efforts. Yet no environmentalist group has suggested that California tap Hetch Hetchy for habitat restoration in the same manner in which it has expropriated the water of farmers.

By late 2014, Pyramid and Castaic Lakes in southern California—part of the vast reserves controlled by the Southern California Metropolitan Water District—remained well above 90 percent of their capacities. But their sources in the distant north had almost no surface water left to give. The cities had drained and banked virtually all the state’s existing reservoirs. Indeed, so well banked are southern California’s project reservoirs that they have enough water to keep millions of customers well supplied through 2015, even as northern and central California communities dry up.

In reaction to these ongoing disasters and fearing a fourth year of drought, the legislature and Governor Jerry Brown placed a $7.5 billion water bond on the November 2014 ballot. It passed, but only a third of the money will go to construction of reservoirs canceled in the 1970s and 1980s. Most of the bond’s provisions will fund huge new state bureaucracies to regulate access to groundwater and mandate recycling. The bond will essentially void more than a century of complex water law as the state moves to curb farmers’ ability to pump water from beneath their own lands. Bay Area legislators who helped draft the bill failed to grasp that farmers bear the huge costs of drilling and pumping, not because they are greedy or insensitive to the environment but because the state’s population has doubled and its water infrastructure has not kept pace. A better way to regulate overdrafts of the water table would have been to increase vastly the amount of reservoir surface water for agriculture so that farmers would have no need to turn on their pumps. But legislators and policymakers let utopianism get in the way.

Last summer, my two agricultural pumps worked from June to late August to keep 40 acres of grapevines alive during 100-degree days. Electricity and pump maintenance are costly. So are the annual irrigation district taxes I’ve paid the last three years for contracted—though undelivered—surface water from the system that my great-grandfather and other pioneers built themselves with horse-drawn scrapers at the turn of the twentieth century. This winter, I added my name to the waiting list to lower the pump bowls—the impellers deep in the well that force the water up through the casing to the surface—in anticipation of another year of drought.

If the drought does continue, vast tracts of west-side farmlands will turn to dust. California’s nearly $30 billion agricultural export industry—led by dairy, almond, and grape production—is in grave peril. Its collapse would crush the economic livelihood of the Central Valley, especially its Hispanic community. When the 5 million-acre west side goes dry, hundreds of thousands of people will lose their jobs in a part of the state where the average unemployment rate already hovers above 10 percent. Farmers will spend hundreds of millions of dollars to deepen their wells further and save what water they can. Everything they and their predecessors have known for a century will be threatened with extinction.

Water is to California as coal is to Kentucky—yet its use is being curtailed by those least affected, if affected at all, by the consequences of their advocacy. But environmentalists, who for 40 years worked to undermine the prudent expansion of the state’s water infrastructure, have a rendezvous with those consequences soon. No reservoir water is left for them to divert—none for the reintroduction of their pet salmon, none for the Delta smelt. Their one hope is to claim possession of the water in the ground once they’ve exhausted what was above it. Redistribution, not expansion of supplies, is the liberal creed for water, just as it is for wealth.

As the Hetch Hetchy reservoir drains, Bay Area man-made storage lakes will necessarily follow. Another year of drought will deplete even southern California’s municipal reserves sooner rather than later. When Stanford professors and Cupertino tech lords cannot take a shower and find themselves paving over their suburban lawns and gardens, perhaps they, too, will see the value of reservoir water for people rather than for fish. The new dust bowl may soon see a different generation of Joads abandoning California for a wetter—and more prosperous—Midwest.

Could California still save itself? New reservoirs to store millions of acre-feet of snowmelt could be built relatively quickly for the price of the state’s high-speed rail boondoggle. Latino voters—the state’s largest minority—might come around to the view that the liberal coastal elite’s obsession with environmental regulations leads to higher electricity rates, gasoline prices, and food costs, along with fewer jobs and economic opportunities. Barring that, there may be only two things left for California farmers to do: pray for the recent wet weather to continue; and, if it does, pray further that environmentalists do not send the precious manna from heaven out to sea.",www.victorhanson.com,right,AzDWBGgYSrNVYth1

Transportation emissions have also been rising in other major cities such as Atlanta, Philadelphia, and San Antonio, according to city climate emissions reports from recent years, and have climbed about 21 percent nationwide since 1990, according to the EPA.

FIGHTING POLLUTION WITH URBAN PLANNING

Other parts of the world could have an easier time.

In Europe, residents of densely populated cities face high fuel taxes, encouraging reduced car travel. Many European cities have seen relatively high levels of electric car adoption.

And in China and India, which also have lofty electric vehicle targets, major cities are still being built - with pollution control in mind.

“They are much better able to bake in this kind of planning into their urban designs,” said John German, a senior fellow with the non-profit International Council on Clean Transportation.

One example is China’s new zone of Xiongan, a spill-off district to ease overcrowding in Beijing, which is being designed from scratch. In a document published in January, the Chinese government promised to incorporate low-carbon development ideas – such as high-speed commuter rail and efficient land use - into its planning for Xiongan to “create a convenient, safe, green and intelligent transportation system”.

China is also seeking to improve fuel standards, ban old cars, and stop diesel trucks from entering certain areas as car ownership surges by about 20 million vehicles per year.

California officials, eager to maintain the state’s leadership role on climate action, hope to pave the way for a fix to entrenched urban sprawl.

Los Angeles is mulling a proposal to charge drivers during rush hour and use that money to make public transit free by 2028, according to Metro Chief Executive Phillip Washington.

Other options include waiving fees for pooled rides to and from airports and adding safety lanes for scooters and bikes, said Dan Sperling, director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis.

CARB Deputy Executive Officer Kurt Karperos said the state is planning talks with municipal governments to discuss controlling emissions through city planning.

Such efforts could include lower-cost housing in urban centers to bring people closer to work, and the elimination of building codes requiring parking spots to encourage more drop-off carpooling, according to experts.

“It is a tough problem,” Karperos said.",www.reuters.com,center,gB3IrzD3lAklhy5z

Over the weekend on his trip to Indonesia , Secretary of State John Kerry implored the global community to take action on climate change , calling it `` the greatest challenge of our generation .

Around the globe , President Obama and his chief diplomat are pressing for urgent action to combat the effects of climate change and reduce carbon pollution before we pass the point of no return . But the decision that will either solidify or irrevocably weaken Obama 's legacy as a leader on climate change lies much closer to home in the proposed Keystone XL pipeline , which would pump heavy tar sands crude through America 's heartland .
The world was watching in June when the President drew a line in the sand during his speech at Georgetown , where he declared that the Keystone XL pipeline would be approved only if `` the project does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution . ''
Today , the world is still watching , and if President Obama is to remain a global climate leader , his choice is clear . Keystone XL fails the President 's climate test , and he must reject it .

But the oil industry has acknowledged that it needs additional pipeline capacity to keep up with increasing production .
A report by the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers predicts that existing pipelines will be full by the end of 2014 . And Keystone XL , which would transport up to 830,000 barrels per day , is only part of the solution . To meet its aggressive 2030 production goals , the industry would need all five of its proposed pipeline projects and then would still fall short .

Others claim that rail is a viable alternative to pipelines and that the tar sands will be developed with or without new pipeline capacity . But they are ignoring key facts .
Industry and Canadian officials have conceded that rail is not a substitute for Keystone XL in terms of capacity . Not only that , rail is significantly more expensive . The State Department estimates that shipping tar sands by pipeline costs about $ 8 to $ 10 per barrel . Make the switch to rail , and the price shoots up to $ 15 to $ 17 per barrel , with some estimates as high as $ 31 . For investors , that means rail is only a short-term solution to get the tar sands to market , not a long-term economical alternative to new pipelines .
The truth is , the oil industry needs to build a pipeline straight through the United States to access refineries on the Gulf Coast , which allows tar sands oil to be sold at higher world market prices . Keystone XL means producers ' profit margins go up , and we 're locked into an endless cycle of investment , production and pollution .
At the end of the day , Keystone XL is not just another oil pipeline ; it 's a gateway to the unchecked development of one of the world 's dirtiest fossil fuels .
Secretary Kerry was right : Climate change is the greatest challenge of our generation , and it is our responsibility to preserve our planet for generations to come . But America can not lead the fight on climate change abroad while allowing even more pollution to be produced in our own backyard . To truly be a global leader on climate change , President Obama must first make the right choices here at home .

And Keystone XL, which would transport up to 830,000 barrels per day, is only part of the solution. To meet its aggressive 2030 production goals, the industry would need all five of its proposed pipeline projects and then would still fall short.

Others claim that rail is a viable alternative to pipelines and that the tar sands will be developed with or without new pipeline capacity. But they are ignoring key facts.

Industry and Canadian officials have conceded that rail is not a substitute for Keystone XL in terms of capacity. Not only that, rail is significantly more expensive. The State Department estimates that shipping tar sands by pipeline costs about $8 to $10 per barrel . Make the switch to rail, and the price shoots up to $15 to $17 per barrel, with some estimates as high as $31. For investors, that means rail is only a short-term solution to get the tar sands to market, not a long-term economical alternative to new pipelines.

The truth is, the oil industry needs to build a pipeline straight through the United States to access refineries on the Gulf Coast, which allows tar sands oil to be sold at higher world market prices. Keystone XL means producers' profit margins go up, and we're locked into an endless cycle of investment, production and pollution.

At the end of the day, Keystone XL is not just another oil pipeline; it's a gateway to the unchecked development of one of the world's dirtiest fossil fuels.

Secretary Kerry was right: Climate change is the greatest challenge of our generation, and it is our responsibility to preserve our planet for generations to come. But America cannot lead the fight on climate change abroad while allowing even more pollution to be produced in our own backyard. To truly be a global leader on climate change, President Obama must first make the right choices here at home. He must deny the Keystone XL pipeline.",www.cnn.com,left,Y9b63OJjegnFzgnk

MADRID ( AP ) — Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg said she was surprised and honored Wednesday to be named Time ’ s youngest Person of the Year , while adding that others in the global movement she helped inspire deserve to share the accolade .
The 16-year-old Swede has become the face of a new generation of environmental activists , drawing large crowds with her appearances at protests and conferences over the past year and a half . Some have welcomed her work , including her speeches challenging world leaders to do more to stop global warming . But others have criticized her sometimes combative tone .
“ For sounding the alarm about humanity ’ s predatory relationship with the only home we have , for bringing to a fragmented world a voice that transcends backgrounds and borders , for showing us all what it might look like when a new generation leads , Greta Thunberg is Time ’ s 2019 Person of the Year , ” the media franchise said on its website .
As she left a U.N. climate conference in Madrid , Thunberg told The ███ that she was “ a bit surprised ” at the recognition .
“ I could never have imagined anything like that happening , ” she said in a phone interview .
“ I ’ m of course , very grateful for that , very honored , ” Thunberg said , but added : “ It should be everyone in the Fridays for Future movement because what we have done , we have done together . ”
Thunberg said she hoped the message being pushed by her and other activists — that governments need to drastically increase their efforts to combat climate change — is finally getting through . The “ Greta effect ” has already been linked to a rise in support for environmental parties in Europe .
But she insisted that the media should also pay attention to other activists , particularly indigenous people , whom she said “ are hit hardest by the climate and environmental crisis . ”
Her concern over the slayings of indigenous Brazilians in the Amazon drew a harsh rebuke from the Latin American nation ’ s president Tuesday .
“ Greta said that the Indians died because they were defending the Amazon , ” Jair Bolsonaro said . “ It ’ s impressive that the press is giving space to a brat like that , ” he added , using the Portuguese word ” pirralha . ”
Thunberg responded by changing her bio on Twitter , where she has over 3 million followers , to say “ Pirralha . ”
The teenager has also been a strong advocate of science , regularly citing complex studies about the causes and impacts of climate change .
On Wednesday , Thunberg used her address at the U.N. ’ s annual climate summit to accuse governments and businesses of misleading the public by holding talks that she said aren ’ t going to stop the world ’ s “ climate emergency . ”
“ The real danger is when politicians and CEOs are making it look like real action is happening , when in fact almost nothing is being done , apart from clever accounting and creative PR , ” she said .
Thunberg cited scientific reports showing that national pledges to reduce reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions aren ’ t enough to meet the ambitious goal set in the 2015 Paris climate accord of keeping temperatures from rising by more than 1.5 degrees Celsis ( 2.7 Fahrenheit ) by the end of the century .
“ This is not leading , this is misleading , ” she told officials , adding that “ every fraction of a degree matters . ”
Thunberg said the youth climate movement , which has staged repeated worldwide protests attended by hundreds of thousands of people , has managed to spread awareness about the need to urgently emissions and help those already affected by global warming .
“ To get in a sense of urgency in the conversation that is very needed right now to be able to move forward , ” she said . “ That , I think , is our biggest success . ”
Asked whether she thought world leaders were beginning to respond to this message , Thunberg told the AP : “ They say they listen and they say they understand , but it sure doesn ’ t seem like it . ”
“ If they really would listen and understand then I think they need to prove that by translating that into action , ” she added .
Thunberg said the experience of the past 15 months , going from solo-protester outside the Swedish parliament to speaking in front of world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly , had changed her .
“ I think life is much more meaningful now that I have something to do that has an impact , ” she said .
Thunberg has tried to preserve some privacy despite the relentless interest she ’ s received from media and adoring fans .
She was mobbed on her arrival in Madrid last week and the attention paid to her appearances at the climate conference has far outstripped that of other events , save for Hollywood stars like Harrison Ford .
“ I would like to be left alone , ” Thunberg said when asked about her immediate plans . But before heading home to Sweden , to spend Christmas with her family and dogs , she will attend a climate protest Friday in Turin , Italy .
“ After that , I have no school to return to until August because I ’ ve taken a gap year , ” she said .
“ I will probably continue a bit like now , travel around . And if I get invitations , to come . And just try everything I can , ” she added .
Last year ’ s Time winners included slain Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi ; the staff of the Capital Gazette in Annapolis , Maryland , where five people were shot to death ; Philippine journalist Maria Ressa ; and two Reuters journalists , Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo .

The teenager has also been a strong advocate of science, regularly citing complex studies about the causes and impacts of climate change.

On Wednesday, Thunberg used her address at the U.N.’s annual climate summit to accuse governments and businesses of misleading the public by holding talks that she said aren’t going to stop the world’s “climate emergency.”

“The real danger is when politicians and CEOs are making it look like real action is happening, when in fact almost nothing is being done, apart from clever accounting and creative PR,” she said.

Thunberg cited scientific reports showing that national pledges to reduce reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions aren’t enough to meet the ambitious goal set in the 2015 Paris climate accord of keeping temperatures from rising by more than 1.5 degrees Celsis (2.7 Fahrenheit) by the end of the century.

“This is not leading, this is misleading,” she told officials, adding that “every fraction of a degree matters.”

Thunberg said the youth climate movement, which has staged repeated worldwide protests attended by hundreds of thousands of people, has managed to spread awareness about the need to urgently emissions and help those already affected by global warming.

“To get in a sense of urgency in the conversation that is very needed right now to be able to move forward,” she said. “That, I think, is our biggest success.”

Asked whether she thought world leaders were beginning to respond to this message, Thunberg told the AP: “They say they listen and they say they understand, but it sure doesn’t seem like it.”

“If they really would listen and understand then I think they need to prove that by translating that into action,” she added.

Thunberg said the experience of the past 15 months, going from solo-protester outside the Swedish parliament to speaking in front of world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly, had changed her.

“I think life is much more meaningful now that I have something to do that has an impact,” she said.

Thunberg has tried to preserve some privacy despite the relentless interest she’s received from media and adoring fans.

She was mobbed on her arrival in Madrid last week and the attention paid to her appearances at the climate conference has far outstripped that of other events, save for Hollywood stars like Harrison Ford.

“I would like to be left alone,” Thunberg said when asked about her immediate plans. But before heading home to Sweden, to spend Christmas with her family and dogs, she will attend a climate protest Friday in Turin, Italy.

“After that, I have no school to return to until August because I’ve taken a gap year,” she said.

“I will probably continue a bit like now, travel around. And if I get invitations, to come. And just try everything I can,” she added.

Last year’s Time winners included slain Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi; the staff of the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland, where five people were shot to death; Philippine journalist Maria Ressa; and two Reuters journalists, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo.

PG & E said it cut power to more than 500,000 customers in Northern California and that it plans to gradually turn off electricity to nearly 800,000 customers to prevent its equipment from starting wildfires during hot , windy weather .
A second group of about 234,000 customers will lose power starting at noon , the utility said .
The utility plans to shut off power in parts of 34 northern , central and coastal California counties to reduce the chance of fierce winds knocking down or toppling trees into power lines during a siege of hot , dry , gusty weather .
Gusts of 56 to 72kph ( 35-45 mph ) were forecast to sweep a vast swath of the state , from the San Francisco Bay area to the agricultural Central Valley and especially in the Sierra Nevada foothills , where a November wildfire blamed on PG & E transmission lines killed 85 people and virtually incinerated the town of Paradise .
The California Department of Forestry and Fire Prevention said it increased staffing in preparation for extreme fire weather .
The winds will be the strongest and most widespread the region has seen in two years , and given the scope of the danger , there was no other choice but to stage the largest preventive blackout in state history , PG & E said .
`` This is a last resort , '' said Sumeet Singh , head of the utility 's Community Wildfire Safety Program .
But Governor Gavin Newsom said people should be outraged . `` No one is satisfied with this , no one is happy with this , '' he said .
The utility needs to upgrade and fix its equipment so massive outages are not the norm going forward , he said .
It could take as many as five days to restore power after the danger has passed because every inch of power line must be checked to make sure it is not damaged or in danger of sparking a blaze , PG & E said .
The news came as residents in the region 's wine country north of San Francisco marked the two-year anniversary of deadly wildfires that killed 44 and destroyed thousands of homes . San Francisco is the only county in the nine-county Bay Area where power will not be affected .
To the south , Southern California Edison said more than 106,000 of its customers in parts of eight counties could face power cuts as early as Thursday as Santa Ana winds loomed .
The cutbacks followed a plan instituted after deadly wildfires - some blamed on downed PG & E transmission lines - destroyed dozens of lives and thousands of homes in recent years and forced the utility into bankruptcy over an estimated $ 30bn in potential damages from lawsuits .
The outages Wednesday were not limited to fire-prone areas because the utilities must turn off entire distribution and transmission lines to much wider areas to minimise the risk of wildfires .
Classes were cancelled for thousands of schoolchildren and at the University of California , Berkeley , Sonoma State University and Mills College .

Once upon a time, lobbyists were told they would have no place in the Obama administration. Transparency would put an end to business as usual in Washington. Alas, there’s no happy ending to this fairy tale. Lobbyists call the shots in this administration.

Republicans on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, including Rep. Darrell E. Issa of California, the panel’s chairman, have joined Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana in ordering the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to hand over documents and emails regarding the cozy association between the agency and the Natural Resources Defense Council. “It appears that [the resources council]’s unprecedented access to high-level EPA officials,” the legislators wrote, “allowed it to influence EPA policy decisions and achieve its own private agenda. Such collusive activities provide the [council], and their financial backers, with an inappropriate opportunity to wield the broad powers of the executive branch. “

The Energy & Environment Legal Institute, in a report of its investigation, provides a clear trail of emails revealing the revolving door between senior EPA officials and radical environmentalists.

In one batch of messages, Sierra Club lobbyists delivered biased research that eager EPA officials snapped up as justification to shut down coal plants. To avoid scrutiny and evade the agency’s visitors log, outside activists and government employees met across the street from EPA headquarters at the J.W. Marriott Hotel. Over coffee, they plotted what they wanted to do, how to do it, and decided the best locations for EPA hearings.

Government officials reciprocated with advance notice of regulatory actions that gave the groups a head start on organizing the appearance of grass-roots support. Sierra Club employees were even allowed to distribute T-shirts at EPA headquarters.

More than a year of wrangling and court battles were required to obtain the emails that describe how the EPA does its shady business. Lisa P. Jackson, the former administrator of the EPA, concealed her participation behind the email pseudonym “Richard Windsor.” That kept public information requests from finding, for example, an email congratulating Al Armendariz, a regional EPA administrator, on his new job. “I just got a call from the Sierra Club,” the email to Mrs. Jackson said. “Al has accepted a job with the Sierra Club, and will run their anti-coal campaign in the Texas region.”

This is a highly orchestrated effort, not the schemes of naive students shuffling across the college commons in dirty jeans and tattered sandals, who think the planetary thermostat will be adjusted if only Americans trade their dishwashers for rags, and vacuum cleaners for brooms and dust pans. Mr. Vitter says the orders come from the “billionaire’s club” of left-wing foundations that pull the strings of environmentalist groups that influence Washington.

Outsiders can only guess what the billionaires are up to, but classic rent-seeking would be the most obvious guess. Opposing things such as the Keystone XL Pipeline opens the way for them to advance their own competing projects. Perhaps they’re like Al Gore, who has used environmental activism to achieve fabulous wealth without having to actually present a useful project.

Mr. Gore got a happy ending to his own fairy tale, but his dream is a nightmare for the rest of us, paying bigger bills for gas and electricity.

Denver was downright balmy on Wednesday with a high in the lower 80s — but the temperature had already plummeted into the upper 20s by 1 a.m. as snow began to fall , according to Accuweather . From 1 to 3 inches of snow is expected to fall in the Mile High City on Thursday .
A similar drastic change happened in Rapid City , South Dakota , which reached a high of 80 degrees Tuesday — but the mercury dipped 40 degrees Wednesday , the weather service reported . As much as 1 foot of snow could fall in the city , according to predictions .
An “ all-out blizzard ” is expected to slam the region spanning central and northeastern South Dakota into central and eastern North Dakota , AccuWeather chief broadcast meteorologist Bernie Rayno said .
Most of the Dakotas will see 6 to 12 inches of snow , but 12 to 24 is likely — with 30 inches possible from north-central South Dakota to central and northeastern North Dakota , Accuweather predicted .
“ A significant , and potentially historic , October winter storm is expected to impact the northern Rockies into the central and northern Plains through Saturday , ” the National Weather Service said in a tweet . “ Significant travel disruptions , power outages , and impacts to agriculture and livestock are all anticipated . ”

Denver was downright balmy on Wednesday with a high in the lower 80s — but the temperature had already plummeted into the upper 20s by 1 a.m. as snow began to fall, according to Accuweather. From 1 to 3 inches of snow is expected to fall in the Mile High City on Thursday.

A similar drastic change happened in Rapid City, South Dakota, which reached a high of 80 degrees Tuesday — but the mercury dipped 40 degrees Wednesday, the weather service reported. As much as 1 foot of snow could fall in the city, according to predictions.

An “all-out blizzard” is expected to slam the region spanning central and northeastern South Dakota into central and eastern North Dakota, AccuWeather chief broadcast meteorologist Bernie Rayno said.

Most of the Dakotas will see 6 to 12 inches of snow, but 12 to 24 is likely — with 30 inches possible from north-central South Dakota to central and northeastern North Dakota, Accuweather predicted.

“A significant, and potentially historic, October winter storm is expected to impact the northern Rockies into the central and northern Plains through Saturday,” the National Weather Service said in a tweet. “Significant travel disruptions, power outages, and impacts to agriculture and livestock are all anticipated.”

You need people to design and manufacture the panels . Then people to market the panels to homes and businesses . Then people to come and install them .
The US solar industry employed about 174,000 people in 2014
That 's a lot of jobs . Even though solar power provides just a tiny fraction of electricity in the United States — about 0.4 percent — the solar industry now employs roughly 174,000 people , according to a survey from the non-profit Solar Foundation . And the industry is expected to add another 36,000 jobs in 2015 , as rooftop installations keep rising at a rapid clip .
To put this in perspective , 174,000 is roughly comparable to the number of workers employed by the US coal industry , if you add up all the workers in coal mining ( about 80,000 ) , plus coal transportation and coal power plants . * * Yet coal still provides 39 percent of America 's electricity — far , far more than solar does .
Now , mind you , this is n't a perfect comparison . Solar is still growing , which means there 's a lot of installation work , whereas no one 's building new coal plants in the US anymore . ( Quite the contrary , many older coal plants have been closing in recent years , thanks to stricter air-pollution rules and cheap natural gas . ) Still , it 's interesting to look at the two industries side-by-side .
There are a few different ways to look at the boom in solar jobs .
From an employment perspective , it 's great . The US has been reeling from a brutal recession , and any source of new jobs is welcome . In 2014 , solar companies added positions 20 times faster than the rest of the economy . And these are relatively decent-paying jobs , with average wages around $ 20 to $ 24 per hour . About 55 percent were installation jobs , 19 percent were manufacturing , and 12 percent sales .
Solar power is still far more labor-intensive than other sources
A more pessimistic way to look at these numbers , however , is to point out that solar power looks like a relatively inefficient way of creating energy . As one 2012 University of Tennessee study found , it takes far more manpower to generate one megawatt-hour of electricity from solar than it does from any other energy source .
And that 's not a good thing . If the world wants to avoid drastic global warming , we 'll need to replace dirtier sources of energy , like coal , with cleaner sources — solar , wind , nuclear , say — and fast . And the higher cost of solar is a real impediment to doing so . Here 's Michael Liebreich , head of Bloomberg New Energy Finance , making this point on Twitter :
. @ scalinggreen Do clean energy boosters understand : boasts about how many jobs a technology `` creates '' also show how expensive it is . — Michael Liebreich ( @ MLiebreich ) January 14 , 2015

. @ guyshrubsole Automated # PV plants , modern installation systems , self-cleaning glass ... That 's how you get cost down , not by carrying jobs . — Michael Liebreich ( @ MLiebreich ) January 14 , 2015
The more encouraging news is that , in some ways , this is already starting to happen . Analysts expect residential solar systems to keep getting cheaper through 2017 , thanks to reductions in `` balance of systems '' costs — things like installation , financing , engineering , and so on .
One example : As the solar market expands , word of mouth will spread , and it will become easier to find new customers without the need to hire as many people in sales . Solar power , in essence , is contagious . And that makes the industry more productive :
If power plants had to internalize all their social costs , clean energy would fare better
There 's another angle here : Solar is far more expensive than coal if you only look at the direct costs of producing electricity . But there are indirect social costs , too . Coal plants produce lots of pollution — soot , mercury , coal ash — that foul the air and water and make people sick . These costs do n't show up on electricity bills . Instead , they 're dumped on the broader public , in the former of shorter lives or higher hospital bills . Coal plants are also a major source of carbon-dioxide emissions , causing damage through global warming .
If power plants had to internalize all these social costs , then sources like wind , solar , or even nuclear power would be far more competitive — as this 2012 paper by economists Michael Greenstone and Adam Looney explained . ( One way to do that might be through a carbon tax on fossil fuels . )
In other words : It would be a major boon for clean energy if solar power keeps getting cheaper and less labor-intensive over time . But getting fossil-fuel users to pay for all the external costs they impose would also make a huge difference .
As the solar industry expands , will it have more clout ?
For years , many US politicians have opposed action on climate change or stricter regulations on air pollution . Often this opposition comes in the form of jobs talk : Obama is waging a `` war on coal '' and killing coal jobs . That worry is n't wholly unfounded . The combination of cheap natural gas and new air pollution regulations really is shrinking the coal industry . And , in areas like West Virginia or eastern Kentucky , that really does mean fewer jobs .
As the coal industry shrinks , its defenders cite jobs as a reason to protect it
But as the Solar Foundation 's report points to , measures to bolster cleaner energy are also creating jobs elsewhere . Over time , that may end up creating a bigger constituency for further clean-energy policies . A US solar industry that employs more people as the still-influential coal industry could have a lot more sway — in Washington and elsewhere .
But it 's still unclear how that will all play out . Right now , the solar industry is still growing rapidly thanks to a 30 percent federal tax credit for rooftop solar systems . But that tax credit is set to expire in 2016 unless Congress extends it in some shape or form . And if the credit does lapse , the solar boom is likely to slow ( though it probably wo n't stop entirely in states that are sunny and have high electricity costs , like California ) .
It 'll be worth watching how the solar industry deals with that over the next few years — and whether all those jobs translate into extra political clout or not .
* * Note on numbers : Over at Climate Desk , Tim McDonnell argued that solar employs twice as many people as coal , although he 's only counting coal miners . I 've also folded in 2006 estimates of people employed in transporting coal and working at coal power plants , which brings coal roughly even with solar . ( It might even put solar ahead , since a number of coal plants have closed since 2006 . )
But even this estimate is n't entirely perfect . As Jonathan Adler pointed out on Twitter , my coal jobs numbers may be an undercount , since they do n't include people working on things like regulatory compliance . Fair enough .

But the party hasn ’ t really rallied around any of those bills . Instead , various segments of the left are off doing their own thing : There are activists fighting pipelines , others fighting power plants , and others pushing divestment ; there are federal bureaucrats working with the tools in the Clean Air Act ; there are wonks fantasizing about a carbon tax ; and there are congressional Democrats , doing basically nothing except condemning President Trump .
As Meyer notes , on health care Dems have “ Medicare-for-all. ” On immigration , they have the DREAM Act . On LGBTQ rights , the Equality Act . What ’ s the slogan , the big bill , the central theme , on climate change ? No one knows .
This lack of consensus , says Meyer , leaves Dems “ shockingly unprepared ” to take action at the federal level . That ’ s one reason ( aside from , y ’ know , Republicans being in charge of everything ) all the real action is at the subnational level , among cities and states , where there are still occasional opportunities to route around partisan gridlock .
This is all true , and interesting , and you should read Meyer ’ s story .
But this seems like a good opportunity to share one of my oldest and most enduring unpopular opinions , namely : The Waxman-Markey bill was good . Furthermore , if there is ever again to be consensus about a federal approach to climate change , it ’ s probably going to look something roughly like the Waxman-Markey bill .
Before you start composing that angry email , hear me out .
Any federal approach to climate change , to be politically and substantively effective , is going to be shaped by the following four imperatives :
It ’ s got to put a price on carbon . It ’ s got to make regulatory changes that encourage a transition to clean energy . It ’ s got to invest a lot of money : in clean energy research , development , and deployment , in infrastructure , in transition assistance , and more . Within the framework of 1-3 , it ’ s got to garner support from lots of diverse constituencies with contradictory demands , few of whom rank climate change high on their list of priorities .
That ’ s an extremely tight needle to thread . Waxman-Markey threaded it about as well as was possible in 2009 . Insofar as it ’ s ever threadable again , the instrument will probably look like an updated version of Waxman-Markey ( though of course its backers will be insane to ever acknowledge that fact ) .
To understand why this highly unpopular argument is correct , it ’ s important to first understand exactly what Waxman-Markey was .
The climate fights of 2006 to 2010 happened during my formative years as a journalist , and I covered them with obsessive attention . In particular , I covered the effort , begun soon after the Democrats took the House in 2006 , to assemble and pass a piece of comprehensive climate legislation , based on a consensus approach that had been brewing in environmental circles for years .
Suffice to say , the reality of Waxman-Markey — the actual bill shepherded through the House by Reps. Henry Waxman and Ed Markey , with crucial help from Speaker Nancy Pelosi — was sharply at odds with the various deformed and hideous phantasms that went by the name “ Waxman-Markey ” in public dialogue .
On the right , the bill was a looming , oppressive “ climate tax , ” an attempt by Democrats to grow government and nationalize large sectors of the economy . On the left , the bill was a corporate sellout , a sleazy Wall Street scheme that would shift money around to polluters but do nothing to reduce emissions .
Neither of those caricatures bore much resemblance to the bill as written ( by Waxman ’ s adorably wonky staff ) . It was neither of those things . Most of all , it was not just a “ cap-and-trade bill . ”
Waxman-Markey was a tripartite piece of legislation , with three equal sections . Roughly speaking : The first established a cap-and-trade system — a declining cap on carbon emissions and a system of tradeable permits beneath it . The second was a series of wonky regulatory changes meant to boost energy efficiency and clean energy , including a national renewable energy mandate for utilities . And the third was a package of investments in clean energy , electric vehicles , assistance to affected industries , job retraining , protections for low-income consumers , and ( much ) more .
In short , the bill was a full-spectrum clean energy transition bill , which paid for its forward-looking investments with a price on carbon . The House team that developed it introduced it as a clean energy bill and always discussed it that way — it was called the “ American Clean Energy and Security Act ” — but they had no help from Republicans , other Dems , or the media , which insisted ( and insists to this day , as Meyer ’ s article reflects ) on treating the bill as though it were only cap and trade .
The tricky task of guiding this comprehensive package through the House was accomplished with incredible skill by Waxman ( one of the last masters of the old politics ) . Along the way , he made plenty of compromises — weakening or eliminating regs , offering subsidies to heavy industry and “ clean coal , ” allocating permits for free , and allowing carbon offsets to be used in lieu of some permits .
These compromises were grubby , of course , and anathema to environmentalists , but they accomplished Waxman ’ s two key goals . First , they preserved the core architecture , especially the declining cap . That architecture , however flawed in its inception , could have been improved by future advocates and lawmakers . And second , the compromises got the bill passed , with eight Republican “ yes ” votes and 44 Democratic “ no ” votes .
The final bill , thanks to Waxman ’ s stewardship , reflected roughly the left edge of the possible in the House at the time . Left activists didn ’ t accept that then , and still don ’ t ; 2009 is subject to endless just-so counterfactuals . ( “ If Obama had just made a few more speeches ... ” ) But in my view , Waxman navigated imperatives 1-4 about as well as he could have .
The bill went on to die in the Senate , of course ( here ’ s my postmortem , from July 2010 ) . Throughout its short gestation and still birth , it was the victim of terrible timing and circumstance , again and again .
First and most fatefully , climate got bumped to fourth in line , after the stimulus , health care , and financial reform — all bruising , extended battles that the Dems eventually won . By late 2009 , Republicans were furious , the Tea Party was organizing , and Dems had lost their fleeting 60-vote Senate supermajority . By early 2010 , when the bill drifted into the Senate , the bloodbath of the 2010 midterms was just over the horizon .
In those circumstances , there was roughly zero chance of getting 60 votes in the Senate for another big Dem achievement , no matter what shape it took .
Though I know people love to debate hypothetical alternative strategies and policies , once climate was bumped back in line , its fate was sealed . The door to bipartisan federal legislation closed tight with the 2010 midterms and has been closed ever since .
The next federal attempt will answer to the same imperatives
Maybe something none of us can now anticipate will break the spell of polarization , loosen up the gridlock , and enable old-fashioned bipartisan ( i.e. , Democrats plus a handful of Republicans ) federal problem solving on climate change . Miracles happen .
If it ever comes to that — if there is ever again a substantial bloc of Republicans in Congress who want to address this problem , enough to get Dems past 60 votes in the Senate — the same imperatives will apply .
1 . There ’ s no way it will happen without pricing carbon . That ’ s the piece virtually everyone except the far right and the far left agrees on . Republicans will want something plausibly “ market-based ” and Dems will want revenue to pay for various investments and incentives . The obvious place to get that revenue is pricing carbon .
As to how to price carbon , I don ’ t know how the perpetual tax versus cap and trade debate will turn out . I could see states cobbling together regional cap-and-trade systems that eventually link up and go national . But the environmental justice community has convinced itself ( erroneously in my view ) that cap and trade is uniquely terrible , so that might fracture the left . Maybe the left and right can agree on a tax .
Who knows ? As I ’ ve written many times , I don ’ t think the pricing mechanism matters as much to the outcome as the balance of interests . A tax and a C & T system can be designed to be functionally equivalent , or designed to be very different . Either can be designed to be durable , or fragile . Either can be corrupted or weakened by special interests . Ultimately , either will reflect those with the power to shape it .
What matters is getting the highest price on carbon ( or the lowest cap on carbon ) that can be gotten . That will require legislators well-briefed and adept enough to probe the edge of the possible .
Thus far , political experience seems to show that a price on carbon sufficient to do the job on its own is rarely , if ever , politically possible . So it must be supplemented by “ complementary policies . ”
2 . One reason a price on carbon is not enough is that unpriced carbon is far from the only market distortion preventing the mythical “ level playing field. ” The energy sector is entirely structured by regulation and ridden with subsidies , old and new , explicit and hidden .
Good faith reform could theoretically bring much more transparency and competition to energy regulation . Many incentives — for energy efficiency , energy storage , or clean energy , for example — could be restructured along performance-based lines . Rather than legislators picking and choosing favored industries or technologies , industries could compete to meet performance metrics .
One way or another , though , regulatory reform will be a huge part of any large-scale effort to address climate change .
3 . There ’ s no way around it : Addressing climate change means spending money — money for clean energy infrastructure , research , and deployment incentives ; money to protect vulnerable communities and trade-exposed industries ; money to prevent deforestation and improve agriculture ; and money to buy off what is certain to be a motley coalition of interest groups , none of which ( except perhaps environmentalists ) are willing to lay down on the railroad tracks for climate change . They will all need other reasons to come along .
Conservatives love the idea of a “ revenue-neutral ” price on carbon , one that automatically returns all the revenue as tax cuts or dividends . But that is unlikely , certainly in standalone piece of climate legislation , for the simple reason that investments are what attract political support .
4 . Balancing all those demands and interests will involve a lot of ugly dealmaking . They will be different deals from the ones Waxman made , because the energy sector has changed enormously since 2009 and will continue changing .
But fossil fuels will not go gentle into that good night . Big Ag is still big . Big Auto and Big Sprawl are still big . Their power will shape the outcome .
The product of federal legislation will be compromised , complicated , and , in many respects , unsavory . That ’ s life in a big democracy . Dreams of a “ simple ” one-page bill are as forlorn now as they were when being used to bash Waxman-Markey in 2009 .
Waxman-Markey was far from perfect . Many of the familiar critiques are valid : It contained too many offsets ; it gave away too many pollution permits for free ; it conceded far too much to the coal industry ( ironically , the bill was probably US coal ’ s last , best chance of survival ) .
Most of all , its ambitions were far too timid . We are already on the verge of hitting its emissions target for 2020 ( 17 percent below 2005 levels ) without any legislation at all . The bill ’ s authors did not foresee the explosive rise of natural gas and renewables or the precipitous decline of coal . They were creatures of 2008 .
Climate wonks have learned a great deal about carbon policy ( and clean energy ) since then , in part due to experimentation around the world and in US states and cities . They will bring those lessons to bear in the next round of legislating . They will be creatures of 2020 ( or 2024 , or 2030 , or whenever ) .
One thing they ’ ve learned — as Simon Fraser University ’ s Mark Jaccard expressed so eloquently — is that a price on carbon will never be enough . The real world will require a blended solution : a price on carbon , regulatory reform , and investments . In other words , the Waxman-Markey template .
Future legislators who tackle these issues may conclude that caps have historically been too timid and opt for a rising tax instead . Or perhaps they ’ ll opt for some hybrid instrument .
But they will extract revenue from carbon emissions . They will use that revenue to make investments and to assemble a working political coalition . And they will do lots of boring but important regulatory reform .
Smart senators who care about climate change , like Merkley , Sanders , and Whitehouse , ought to start thinking about what shape such a bill might take , even knowing it will be politically impossible for the foreseeable future . They ought to think about what essential theme it embodies — the simple Democratic message on climate change and clean energy .
Hopefully , next time they will sell it based not on the mechanism through which it raises money , but on the social and economic benefits it produces : a cleaner , safer , and more stable future .
Waxman-Markey got a bum rap and will mostly be remembered as a failure . But when our national fever finally breaks , and future legislators return to the table seeking a path forward on climate change , they will be following a trail Waxman-Markey blazed .
They will discover that the lost consensus of 2008 — in its basic shape , if not its particular numbers and details — was always what consensus will look like . And , however fitfully and slowly , they will find their way back .","Someday — perhaps even someday soon — Democrats will regain some power in the US federal government. What would that mean for climate change policy?

Over at the Atlantic, Rob Meyer tries to answer that question with an insightful piece examining the state of play on climate change politics in the Democratic Party. It is, to make a long story short, a mess. The fragile consensus that once existed among Democrats, embodied in the Waxman-Markey climate bill that passed the House in 2009, fragmented when that bill died an ignominious death in the Senate the following year.

And Humpty Dumpty hasn’t been put back together again.

Sens. Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Bernie Sanders of Vermont are holding down the progressive end of things, with bills that would end fossil fuel leasing on federal land and target 100 percent renewable electricity by 2050. In the House, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii has proposed the even more ambitious OFF Act, which would target 100 clean energy by 2035.

But the party hasn’t really rallied around any of those bills. Instead, various segments of the left are off doing their own thing: There are activists fighting pipelines, others fighting power plants, and others pushing divestment; there are federal bureaucrats working with the tools in the Clean Air Act; there are wonks fantasizing about a carbon tax; and there are congressional Democrats, doing basically nothing except condemning President Trump.

As Meyer notes, on health care Dems have “Medicare-for-all.” On immigration, they have the DREAM Act. On LGBTQ rights, the Equality Act. What’s the slogan, the big bill, the central theme, on climate change? No one knows.

This lack of consensus, says Meyer, leaves Dems “shockingly unprepared” to take action at the federal level. That’s one reason (aside from, y’know, Republicans being in charge of everything) all the real action is at the subnational level, among cities and states, where there are still occasional opportunities to route around partisan gridlock.

This is all true, and interesting, and you should read Meyer’s story.

But this seems like a good opportunity to share one of my oldest and most enduring unpopular opinions, namely: The Waxman-Markey bill was good.

The once and future consensus

Waxman-Markey was far from perfect. Many of the familiar critiques are valid: It contained too many offsets; it gave away too many pollution permits for free; it conceded far too much to the coal industry (ironically, the bill was probably US coal’s last, best chance of survival).

Most of all, its ambitions were far too timid. We are already on the verge of hitting its emissions target for 2020 (17 percent below 2005 levels) without any legislation at all. The bill’s authors did not foresee the explosive rise of natural gas and renewables or the precipitous decline of coal. They were creatures of 2008.

But the basic approach? It was good.

Climate wonks have learned a great deal about carbon policy (and clean energy) since then, in part due to experimentation around the world and in US states and cities. They will bring those lessons to bear in the next round of legislating. They will be creatures of 2020 (or 2024, or 2030, or whenever).

environment,Vox,0,http://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/3/3/14802618/trump-advisers-debate-paris-climate,3 things to watch for as Steve Bannon and Ivanka Trump fight over the Paris climate deal,2017-03-03,"Brad Plumer, Li Zhou, Aja Romano, Anna North, Dylan Matthews, Ian Millhiser, Sean Collins","President Trump ’ s advisers are reportedly having a big internal debate over whether the US should pull out of the Paris climate deal — the key international treaty to address global warming .
During the campaign , Trump promised to “ cancel ” the deal , and senior adviser Stephen Bannon wants him to follow through immediately , reports Coral Davenport of the New York Times . On the other side , Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Ivanka Trump are urging Trump to keep the US in the treaty , fearing that an abrupt withdrawal would have “ broad and damaging diplomatic ramifications . ”
But there are a few important nuances to this issue worth drawing out . If Trump does decide to walk away from Paris , pay attention to how he does it — since that could influence whether countries like India or Brazil end up paring back their climate efforts in response . Conversely , if Trump ends up sticking with Paris , we ’ ll have to see if the US waters down its various promises under the accord — and also how the State Department approaches negotiations on the treaty ’ s future in the years ahead . Because that , too , could undermine the accord .
1 ) If Trump decides to leave the Paris deal , how does he do it ?
Under the Paris climate deal , nearly every nation put forward an individual pledge to curb greenhouse gas emissions . The US vowed to cut its emissions 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 . China vowed to get 20 percent of its energy from low-carbon sources by 2030 . And so on . Countries also agreed to meet regularly and review and strengthen their pledges , known as “ nationally determined contributions ” ( NDCs ) .
But the Paris accord isn ’ t a legally binding treaty — it hasn ’ t been ratified by the Senate , and it ’ s effectively voluntary . So if Trump wanted , he has a few options for pulling out , each more drastic than the last .
One possibility would be for Trump to invoke the Paris accord ’ s formal withdrawal mechanisms , which would take four years to complete . Or , more radically , the US could pull out of the underlying United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , which would take just one year to do and signal that the US is withdrawing from all international efforts on climate change .
Either option would be seismic . “ If they pull out altogether , ” Light says , “ the chances increase that developing countries like Brazil or India back away from their own commitments and say , ‘ Why should we bother doing this if the world ’ s biggest historical emitter is completely out of the game now ? ’ ”
That doesn ’ t mean other countries would leave the deal , too — China and India have their own reasons for acting on global warming — but a US withdrawal could well blunt the global momentum on climate action that has been building the past few years .
Now , if Trump opts for withdrawal , he ’ s likely to face all sorts of international condemnation and blowback . Europe , China , and other countries could threaten to withhold cooperation on issues the US cares about . Maybe Trump wouldn ’ t care . But it ’ s also possible , as Sen. Bob Corker ( R-TN ) hinted to the Times , that Trump will decide it ’ s smarter to just keep the US in the Paris deal . After all , the individual pledges are voluntary . There ’ s no concrete harm in hanging around . Why not ?
2 ) If Trump sticks with Paris , does he revise the US pledges downward ?
Okay , now imagine Trump decides to stay in the Paris accord . After the initial fanfare subsides , there ’ s the crucial question of whether the Trump administration would try to fulfill any of the Obama administration ’ s commitments under the deal — including the pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 .
Odds are , they wouldn ’ t . Trump has already vowed to repeal many of Obama ’ s climate policies , including the Clean Power Plan to curtail emissions from power plants as well as various regulations around methane leaks from oil and gas operations . That will make it nearly impossible to meet Obama ’ s pledge .
So one very real possibility is that the Trump administration simply revises the US emissions goal downward — something they have the legal right to do ( though it would flout the spirit of the accord , which aims to enhance ambition over time ) . A move like that might , in turn , lead other countries to reconsider their own climate plans . If the United States isn ’ t taking its pledge seriously , why should they ?
On top of that , a core part of the Paris deal involves the US pledging $ 3 billion in aid to poorer countries to help them expand clean energy and adapt to droughts , sea-level rise , and other ravages of global warming . The Obama administration already chipped in $ 1 billion . But Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration have insisted they have no intention of delivering the rest .
Some experts think that Trump abandoning US commitments on aid could be nearly as damaging to international climate efforts as withdrawing from Paris altogether . “ For the developing countries , this will be a sign that America is unreliable and that the benefits of staying engaged in climate negotiations are fleeting , ” writes David Victor , a political scientist with the University of California San Diego .
That said , Light thinks this outcome could prove less disruptive than total withdrawal : Say Trump stayed in Paris , revised down the US targets , and dismantled the Clean Power Plan . Even then , Light points out , there ’ d still be enough action from states and cities that you could imagine the US making at least some headway on emissions , even if far less than Obama promised . “ And that would still leave the possibility that the US could rebound [ on climate action ] after one term of Trump , ” he says .
3 ) If Trump sticks with Paris , how might US negotiators shape future agreements ?
The 2015 Paris deal was only a first step in the long , grinding process of dealing with climate change — and a woefully inadequate step at that . If you add up all the NDCs worldwide , they don ’ t come close to keeping us below 2°C of global warming . They add up to a severe 3°C or more , depending on which analysis you trust :
The hope with the Paris accord was that these individual national pledges would be strengthened over time , as countries cooperated and pushed each other to pursue deeper emissions cuts . So a key question here is what role US climate negotiators might play in this ratcheting process .
For example : Over the next two years , negotiators are meeting at the UN to hash out rules around how to review individual country pledges and policies . This “ transparency mechanism ” could prove a contentious subject . The Bush and Obama administrations had long pushed for strict , uniform transparency standards . China and various developing nations , by contrast , have in the past preferred a “ bifurcated ” system that holds them to somewhat looser reporting requirements .
If Trump does stay in Paris , will the US try to hold China and other developing countries to the strictest transparency standards possible ?

Further reading : Our primer on how the Paris climate deal works .","President Trump’s advisers are reportedly having a big internal debate over whether the US should pull out of the Paris climate deal — the key international treaty to address global warming.

During the campaign, Trump promised to “cancel” the deal, and senior adviser Stephen Bannon wants him to follow through immediately, reports Coral Davenport of the New York Times. On the other side, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Ivanka Trump are urging Trump to keep the US in the treaty, fearing that an abrupt withdrawal would have “broad and damaging diplomatic ramifications.”

But there are a few important nuances to this issue worth drawing out. If Trump does decide to walk away from Paris, pay attention to how he does it — since that could influence whether countries like India or Brazil end up paring back their climate efforts in response. Conversely, if Trump ends up sticking with Paris, we’ll have to see if the US waters down its various promises under the accord — and also how the State Department approaches negotiations on the treaty’s future in the years ahead. Because that, too, could undermine the accord.

“There are important degrees here,” says Andrew Light, a former senior climate negotiator at the State Department who is now at the World Resources Institute. “The further they step away, the more likely it will have repercussions in other countries.” To make this a bit clearer, here are three big things to watch:

1) If Trump decides to leave the Paris deal, how does he do it?

Under the Paris climate deal, nearly every nation put forward an individual pledge to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The US vowed to cut its emissions 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. China vowed to get 20 percent of its energy from low-carbon sources by 2030. And so on. Countries also agreed to meet regularly and review and strengthen their pledges, known as “nationally determined contributions” (NDCs).

But the Paris accord isn’t a legally binding treaty — it hasn’t been ratified by the Senate, and it’s effectively voluntary. So if Trump wanted, he has a few options for pulling out, each more drastic than the last.

One possibility would be for Trump to invoke the Paris accord’s formal withdrawal mechanisms, which would take four years to complete. Or, more radically, the US could pull out of the underlying United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which would take just one year to do and signal that the US is withdrawing from all international efforts on climate change.

Either option would be seismic. “If they pull out altogether,” Light says, “the chances increase that developing countries like Brazil or India back away from their own commitments and say, ‘Why should we bother doing this if the world’s biggest historical emitter is completely out of the game now?’”

That doesn’t mean other countries would leave the deal, too — China and India have their own reasons for acting on global warming — but a US withdrawal could well blunt the global momentum on climate action that has been building the past few years.

Now, if Trump opts for withdrawal, he’s likely to face all sorts of international condemnation and blowback. Europe, China, and other countries could threaten to withhold cooperation on issues the US cares about. Maybe Trump wouldn’t care. But it’s also possible, as Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) hinted to the Times, that Trump will decide it’s smarter to just keep the US in the Paris deal. After all, the individual pledges are voluntary. There’s no concrete harm in hanging around. Why not?

2) If Trump sticks with Paris, does he revise the US pledges downward?

Okay, now imagine Trump decides to stay in the Paris accord. After the initial fanfare subsides, there’s the crucial question of whether the Trump administration would try to fulfill any of the Obama administration’s commitments under the deal — including the pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.

Odds are, they wouldn’t. Trump has already vowed to repeal many of Obama’s climate policies, including the Clean Power Plan to curtail emissions from power plants as well as various regulations around methane leaks from oil and gas operations. That will make it nearly impossible to meet Obama’s pledge.

So one very real possibility is that the Trump administration simply revises the US emissions goal downward — something they have the legal right to do (though it would flout the spirit of the accord, which aims to enhance ambition over time). A move like that might, in turn, lead other countries to reconsider their own climate plans. If the United States isn’t taking its pledge seriously, why should they?

On top of that, a core part of the Paris deal involves the US pledging $3 billion in aid to poorer countries to help them expand clean energy and adapt to droughts, sea-level rise, and other ravages of global warming. The Obama administration already chipped in $1 billion. But Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration have insisted they have no intention of delivering the rest.

Some experts think that Trump abandoning US commitments on aid could be nearly as damaging to international climate efforts as withdrawing from Paris altogether. “For the developing countries, this will be a sign that America is unreliable and that the benefits of staying engaged in climate negotiations are fleeting,” writes David Victor, a political scientist with the University of California San Diego.

That said, Light thinks this outcome could prove less disruptive than total withdrawal: Say Trump stayed in Paris, revised down the US targets, and dismantled the Clean Power Plan. Even then, Light points out, there’d still be enough action from states and cities that you could imagine the US making at least some headway on emissions, even if far less than Obama promised. “And that would still leave the possibility that the US could rebound [on climate action] after one term of Trump,” he says.

3) If Trump sticks with Paris, how might US negotiators shape future agreements?

The 2015 Paris deal was only a first step in the long, grinding process of dealing with climate change — and a woefully inadequate step at that. If you add up all the NDCs worldwide, they don’t come close to keeping us below 2°C of global warming. They add up to a severe 3°C or more, depending on which analysis you trust:

The hope with the Paris accord was that these individual national pledges would be strengthened over time, as countries cooperated and pushed each other to pursue deeper emissions cuts. So a key question here is what role US climate negotiators might play in this ratcheting process.

For example: Over the next two years, negotiators are meeting at the UN to hash out rules around how to review individual country pledges and policies. This “transparency mechanism” could prove a contentious subject. The Bush and Obama administrations had long pushed for strict, uniform transparency standards. China and various developing nations, by contrast, have in the past preferred a “bifurcated” system that holds them to somewhat looser reporting requirements.

If Trump does stay in Paris, will the US try to hold China and other developing countries to the strictest transparency standards possible? And if so, how much leverage will the US really have here if we’re also reneging on our emissions targets and aid promises elsewhere? (Obviously, if the US leaves Paris entirely, it won’t have any leverage over transparency.)

This sounds like an obscure issue, but for many observers it’s critical. After all, climate change is a collective action problem. Countries are less likely to take the plunge and push for emissions cuts unless they know everyone else will jump with them. “To me, the essence of this agreement is what it can do to strengthen confidence that everyone’s doing their fair share, primarily through greater transparency,” says Elliot Diringer, executive vice president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. “With greater confidence, everyone can do more. Weaker transparency rules would make it harder to strengthen confidence and ambition over time.”

Beyond transparency, the world’s nations are also supposed to formally take stock of their progress by 2018 and then submit new — and ideally stronger — NDCs by 2020. But this process of strengthening global pledges could get bogged down if the United States is dismantling domestic climate policies and weakening its stated ambitions. It’s not hard to imagine India or China feeling less pressure to step up their efforts if the richest country on Earth is backsliding.

The basic point here is that the Paris climate deal isn’t guaranteed to succeed just because Trump sticks with the agreement. These nuances of what happens to a process that’s already well underway really do matter — and there are lots of ways the US could potentially weaken it from within.

Redford: Current path is unsustainable, threatens our health and increases costs

I've been in Georgia for the last few weeks, where I'm filming a movie about two out-of-shape geezers who take on the long walk of the Appalachian Trial -- the Blue Ridge Mountains, the Smokies, Cumberlands, and the Shenandoah Valley. It's possible to wander huge stretches of this great American wilderness and never see a sign that the 2,100-mile trail runs through the heart of coal country.

For a century, the people who live alongside the Appalachian Trail have built their lives around where there was coal, because where there was coal there was work. Dirty, dangerous, terribly difficult work -- but work.

Now, this too is changing, and coal, inevitably, is going away -- and with it, the only way of life these hardworking people have ever known. It's a wrenching change. In 1979, there were 62,500 coal miners in West Virginia. Today there are just 23,000 . Coal reserves are shrinking, mechanization means fewer jobs per ton, production is shifting to cheaper areas, and low-cost supplies of unconventional natural gas are pricing coal out of the electric power market.

At the same time, a preponderance of scientific evidence makes clear that climate change caused by fossil fuel pollution is already having tremendous impact on the world around us. It's making our oceans rise, putting our food supplies at risk, increasing the chances of extreme weather, and contributing to political instability in nations around the world.

However, we know how to fix the problem. We can avoid the most destructive impacts of climate change -- but only if we move quickly to convert to energy supplies dominated by clean power.

Here's a way to start that work: The Obama administration will propose the first limits on carbon pollution from coal-fired plants, which on their own create roughly 40% of the nation's total carbon emissions. A recent analysis by the Natural Resources Defense Council (where I serve as a board member) found that putting these rules in place would be the equivalent of removing up to 130 million cars from our roads. At the same time, this approach would yield as much as $63 billion in health, air quality and clean water benefits -- numbers that far outweigh the costs of putting limits on carbon pollution.

That's why these new rules are a big deal -- the biggest step our country has ever taken on curbing carbon pollution. Demonstrating that kind of leadership could mark an important turning point in the global climate effort.

And so, right now, we must choose between two paths.

One path brings opportunities for more innovation. New technologies can clean up our skies, create jobs here and actions abroad. This path harnesses American wind, solar, geothermal and energy efficiency to begin eliminating our reliance on foreign energy supplies. And it helps ensure our children and grandchildren avoid a dangerous battle with rising seas, scorched farmlands and more dangerous storms as climate change bears down further in the coming decades.

Or there's the other path -- the one we've taken for the past century -- which sustains an ever-dirtier status quo. It's a path that reduces the beautiful mountains of Appalachia to rubble for the black rocks that all but guarantee climate chaos for future generations. It mandates a future reliant on exporting that coal and darkening the skies around the world, while leaving opportunities for innovation to other countries more willing and able to embrace positive change. And it's one where ever fewer workers are hired for dangerous jobs that put them at physical risk, threatening their health and burdening their local communities with pollution.

Nevertheless, the apprehension in coal country to leave this current path is understandable. We would all feel it if we were in their shoes. Outsiders can't ignore the plight of the families and the affected communities, and we have an obligation to ensure that they have a strong economic bridge to a sustainable, clean energy future.

That must be central to the broader effort to cut power plant pollution, which is why the Environmental Protection Agency will give each state the ability to create its own approach to cutting pollution, rightfully recognizing the need to be flexible for coal states. After all, as past efforts to clean up pollution have shown us, this effort will only succeed if we all work together.

Over the past 40 years, we have recognized the health threats and costs of pollution and put in place a range of commonsense limits on power-plant pollutants like lead, mercury and arsenic. Now it's time to put the same kind of limits on the dangerous carbon pollution and create safer and better jobs for our energy workers in the process.

As carbon dioxide levels in the oceans increase , upping the acidity of the water , shark teeth and scales may begin to corrode , compromising their ability to swim , hunt and feed , according to research published today in Scientific Reports .
Ultimately , sharks could be displaced as apex predators , disrupting entire ocean food webs , says the study ’ s senior author Lutz Auerswald , a fisheries biologist at Stellenbosch University in South Africa and the nation ’ s Department of Agriculture , Forestry and Fisheries . “ Some of the bigger species , like great white sharks , are also already highly endangered , so this might wipe them out . ”
Auerswald and Sarika Singh , an ocean researcher at South Africa ’ s Department of Environmental Affairs , stumbled upon the idea for their study over beers . Realizing that the high acidity of beer and many other carbonated beverages causes human teeth to erode , Singh wondered what effect more acidic ocean water might have on shark teeth .
Most studies on ocean acidification examine species that build shells or other calcium-based structures , including corals and shellfish . Possibly because sharks are large and difficult to work with—and because many of them are endangered—only a few studies to date have looked at how acidification might impact the animals . Just one paper has examined the effect of pH ( the scale that measures how basic or acidic a substance is ) on sharks ’ skin denticles , or scales . That study , conducted on small-spotted cat sharks , a species in the North Atlantic , did not find a significant impact . But its results were possibly constrained by the relatively low carbon dioxide concentration the researchers used , compared with the high levels of acidity already present in many places in the world ’ s oceans .

Auerswald , Singh and their colleagues focused on puff adder shy sharks , a small , bottom-dwelling South African species of cat shark that is easily handled and not endangered . The sharks ’ teeth are very small , so the team decided to investigate acidification ’ s effects on the animals ’ comparatively bigger scales . ( Because shark teeth and scales are both made of a calcium phosphate material called dentin , the researchers would expect the effects on teeth to be similar to any impact on the scales . )
The researchers captured puff adder shy sharks in a harbor in Cape Town , South Africa , and transported them to a government research aquarium , where the fish acclimated for four months . They divided 13 of the sharks into control and experimental groups . Control animals stayed in an aquarium with a mildly basic pH of 8.1 , matching that of the ocean , while the researchers gradually dropped the pH of the experimental animals ’ water to 7.3 , the level that ocean water is predicted to hit by 2300 if carbon dioxide emissions continue . ( In some areas , including the waters off South Africa and California , the pH can already drop to 7.3 or lower , depending on prevailing currents and winds . )

After two months , an electron-microscope analysis revealed that the concentrations of calcium and phosphate in the sharks ’ denticles were significantly reduced . About 25 percent of the experimental group ’ s scales were damaged , compared with only 9 percent in the control group . “ If dissolution is already visible [ after just two months ] , one can only speculate how the sharks would look after a year or more , ” says Fredrik Jutfelt , a biologist at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology , who was not involved in the latest research but co-authored the only other study of shark scales in acidic conditions . “ Increased dissolution of denticles could have serious consequences for sharks for many reasons . ”
The impacts , however , would likely vary between species , Auerswald says . Puff adder shy sharks are sedentary predators that ambush their prey , so corroded scales might not impact their ability to hunt . But for larger species that swim in open water , such as great white sharks , scales play an important role in hydrodynamics . One study found that shark denticles are responsible for an up to 12 percent increase in swimming speed . Thus , damaged denticles could slow sharks down and make it more difficult for them to catch prey . Scales also protect females from male biting during courtship and help some shark species defend against other predators . Likewise corrosion to teeth could hit some species harder than others .
Other groups of calcifying organisms , for whom the effects of acidification are more well-studied , show these wide-ranging differences . Auerswald and his colleagues have observed that lobsters are quite resilient in the face of acidification , whereas abalones grow significantly slower , and “ their shells look horrible , ” he says . “ A lot of animals have survived even more acidic conditions in the ancient past , but we also know that a lot of species were wiped out , ” Auerswald says . “ One lesson is that you have to test species by species . ”","Sharks are some of the world’s most formidable predators, but their place at the top of the marine food chain may be threatened by ocean warming and acidification.

No wind energy company has been prosecuted , even those that repeatedly flout the law .
Wind power , a pollution-free energy intended to ease global warming , is a cornerstone of President Barack Obama 's energy plan . His administration has championed a $ 1 billion-a-year tax break to the industry that has nearly doubled the amount of wind power in his first term .

Dan Ashe , the Fish and Wildlife Service 's director , said in an interview Monday with the AP said that his agency always has made clear to wind companies that if they kill birds they would still be liable .
`` We are not allowing them to do it . They do it , '' he said of the bird deaths . `` And we will successfully prosecute wind companies if they are in significant noncompliance . ''
But by not enforcing the law so far , the administration provides little incentive for companies to build wind farms where there are fewer birds .

Wind farms are clusters of turbines as tall as 30-story buildings , with spinning rotors the size of jetliners .

Former Interior Secretary Ken Salazar , in an interview with the AP before his departure , denied any preferential treatment for wind . Interior Department officials said that criminal prosecution , regardless of the industry , is always a `` last resort . ''
`` There 's still additional work to be done with eagles and other avian species , but we are working on it very hard , '' Salazar said . `` We will get to the right balance . ''
Meanwhile , the Obama administration has proposed a rule that would give wind-energy companies potentially decades of shelter from prosecution for killing eagles . The regulation is currently under review at the White House .
The proposal , made at the urging of the wind-energy industry , would allow companies to apply for 30-year permits to kill a set number of bald or golden eagles . Previously , companies were only eligible for five-year permits .
`` It 's basically guaranteeing a black box for 30 years , and they 're saying ` trust us for oversight ' .

Last year , over objections from some of its own wildlife investigators and biologists , the Interior Department updated its guidelines and provided more cover for wind companies that violate the law .
Under both the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act , the death of a single bird without a permit is illegal .

An estimated crowd of nearly 400,000 climate activists flooded New York City ’ s streets on Sunday in a coming-out party for a new breed of environmentalism – one that ’ s louder and rowdier than the old-school greens who dominated the movement when Barack Obama entered the White House .
These upstarts like 350.org are brushing aside the staid Washington lobbying strategies of groups that failed to pass a climate bill in 2010 . Instead they ’ re getting arrested outside the White House gates , staging costumed protests around the president ’ s travels and planning to clog Wall Street on Monday . They ’ ve already chalked up one big win : turning the Keystone XL pipeline decision into a political nightmare for Obama .
Like the tea party , the new groups and their disruptive , anti-establishment approach have created lots of buzz , something they aimed to amplify with the huger-than-expected turnout for Sunday ’ s celebrity-studded protest march through midtown Manhattan . But their movement still hasn ’ t proven it can succeed consistently on policy-making — which requires an inside game to bring victories like a meaningful global climate pact or strong regulations to throttle greenhouse gases .
“ We can ’ t dismiss the importance of legislating , and we don ’ t mean to , ” said Jamie Henn , the strategy director who co-founded 350.org seven years ago , fresh out of college , alongside writer-turned-activist Bill McKibben . “ What we ’ re trying to show is that there ’ s a way to wield political influence through different avenues . ”
Organizers hope Sunday ’ s march , which came two days before a scheduled United Nations climate summit , will show governments at home and abroad that a potent , diverse constituency for cutting carbon emissions exists in America .
The march came four years after the nation ’ s most established environmental groups , such as the Environmental Defense Fund and the Natural Resources Defense Council , tried and failed to use a mostly inside-the-Beltway lobbying strategy to get Congress to enact cap and trade . Now all are joining McKibben ’ s group in Sunday ’ s mass protest .
While the march was timed to Obama ’ s appearance at the summit , Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said a strong U.N. pact on global emissions cuts is not required for the event to succeed . “ What we expect to see from this march is a continued surge in strategic climate activism , ” Brune said before the event . “ Our ability as a movement to be more aggressive , the ability to hold weak-kneed politicians accountable , has made us more effective . ”
The new breed reigns supreme on social media : 350 has 201,000 Twitter followers , more than the Sierra Club , League of Conservation Voters , the NRDC or EDF . When McKibben launched a live climate tour in 2012 , an estimated 24,000 people helped sell out 22 shows , and his group has volunteers in 188 countries . Its lobbying budget is tiny , though — because it tends to disdains all that .
Still , even though organizers said Sunday ’ s march drew far more than the 100,000 they had hoped for , activists face a steep challenge if they want to connect those supporters with the big political goal that several major green groups have set for November : keeping the Senate in Democratic hands . Climate activist billionaire Tom Steyer — who attended the march — and the League of Conservation Voters are each putting tens of millions of dollars into the midterm elections . Should Republicans retake the chamber , pressure to slow down EPA regulations and approve Keystone would mount quickly in 2015 .
“ I just wish the energy you see going into New York , that gets put into the march , was spent marching through precincts in battleground congressional districts and in battleground states , ” one veteran environmental consultant said , calling the march “ a theater game . ”
A Republican oil industry consultant responded similarly to the march ’ s ultra-liberal locale and A-list backers : “ When Al Gore , Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Steyer fly to battleground states to hold public climate marches in the midst of campaign season with their preferred candidates , then we will know they are serious , ” the consultant said .
The agendas on display Sunday ranged from local campaigns against Keystone and fracking to the priorities of minority and union groups that 350 wants to bring into the tent of a movement long identified with affluent whites . The rally aspired to be all things to all activists , asking marchers to line up by themed groups in a bid to show the world the largest possible constituency for tackling climate change .
Such a big-tent approach brings overlapping political goals . The labor group Blue Green Alliance , where some members back Keystone , appeared alongside activists who oppose the pipeline . ( Blue Green Executive Director Kim Glas said the march is “ about an agenda that actually unites us , not about Keystone . ” )","The new groups and their disruptive, anti-establishment approach have created lots of buzz. | M.Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO Rowdy greens take charge

Instead they’re getting arrested outside the White House gates, staging costumed protests around the president’s travels and planning to clog Wall Street on Monday. They’ve already chalked up one big win: turning the Keystone XL pipeline decision into a political nightmare for Obama.

Like the tea party, the new groups and their disruptive, anti-establishment approach have created lots of buzz, something they aimed to amplify with the huger-than-expected turnout for Sunday’s celebrity-studded protest march through midtown Manhattan. But their movement still hasn’t proven it can succeed consistently on policy-making — which requires an inside game to bring victories like a meaningful global climate pact or strong regulations to throttle greenhouse gases.

“We can’t dismiss the importance of legislating, and we don’t mean to,” said Jamie Henn, the strategy director who co-founded 350.org seven years ago, fresh out of college, alongside writer-turned-activist Bill McKibben. “What we’re trying to show is that there’s a way to wield political influence through different avenues.”

Organizers hope Sunday’s march, which came two days before a scheduled United Nations climate summit, will show governments at home and abroad that a potent, diverse constituency for cutting carbon emissions exists in America.

The march came four years after the nation’s most established environmental groups, such as the Environmental Defense Fund and the Natural Resources Defense Council, tried and failed to use a mostly inside-the-Beltway lobbying strategy to get Congress to enact cap and trade. Now all are joining McKibben’s group in Sunday’s mass protest.

While the march was timed to Obama’s appearance at the summit, Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said a strong U.N. pact on global emissions cuts is not required for the event to succeed. “What we expect to see from this march is a continued surge in strategic climate activism,” Brune said before the event. “Our ability as a movement to be more aggressive, the ability to hold weak-kneed politicians accountable, has made us more effective.”

The new breed reigns supreme on social media: 350 has 201,000 Twitter followers, more than the Sierra Club, League of Conservation Voters, the NRDC or EDF. When McKibben launched a live climate tour in 2012, an estimated 24,000 people helped sell out 22 shows, and his group has volunteers in 188 countries. Its lobbying budget is tiny, though — because it tends to disdains all that.

Still, even though organizers said Sunday’s march drew far more than the 100,000 they had hoped for, activists face a steep challenge if they want to connect those supporters with the big political goal that several major green groups have set for November: keeping the Senate in Democratic hands. Climate activist billionaire Tom Steyer — who attended the march — and the League of Conservation Voters are each putting tens of millions of dollars into the midterm elections. Should Republicans retake the chamber, pressure to slow down EPA regulations and approve Keystone would mount quickly in 2015.

“I just wish the energy you see going into New York, that gets put into the march, was spent marching through precincts in battleground congressional districts and in battleground states,” one veteran environmental consultant said, calling the march “a theater game.”

A Republican oil industry consultant responded similarly to the march’s ultra-liberal locale and A-list backers: “When Al Gore, Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Steyer fly to battleground states to hold public climate marches in the midst of campaign season with their preferred candidates, then we will know they are serious,” the consultant said.

The agendas on display Sunday ranged from local campaigns against Keystone and fracking to the priorities of minority and union groups that 350 wants to bring into the tent of a movement long identified with affluent whites. The rally aspired to be all things to all activists, asking marchers to line up by themed groups in a bid to show the world the largest possible constituency for tackling climate change.

Such a big-tent approach brings overlapping political goals. The labor group Blue Green Alliance, where some members back Keystone, appeared alongside activists who oppose the pipeline.

As climate change accelerates , the pressures on rural Bangladeshis mount . Where previously people might have been able to move away for the worst of seasonal flooding , the regularity of waterlogging is making it impossible to farm . Crop varieties can not cope with the saltwater , and career alternatives are limited .
What , then , can be done for the most vulnerable people ; the rural rice farmers of Bangladesh ?
Historically , people in Bangladesh had worked around seasonal flooding ; farming for part of the year and retreating when water levels rose , or seeking work in the cities as land became unusable .
By the end of the century , however , sea levels are expected to rise along the Bangladesh coastline by up to 1.5m . And that will come with more extreme seasonal fluctuations in sea levels . Disastrous storms and unusually high tides currently occur once each decade , but could become as regular as three to 15 times each year by 2100 .
As a result , rural Bangladeshis face a stark choice ; change their way or life or seek employment and a home elsewhere .
“ The climate is becoming more volatile so we are seeing higher frequency of migration , ” says Joyce Chen , an economist at The Ohio State University . “ Where in the past we see migration due to annual flooding , or river bank erosion , now we see saltwater intrusion more commonly which affects the environment long term . It makes it harder to grow crops because the land is permanently altered by the saline water. ” In the past , he says , people could go to work in the city for a few months while the land was flooded and return when the flood had retreated . Now that is no longer possible . “ People realise it is not viable to stay . ”
For some , the saltwater offers an opportunity . Where rice might have once grown , shrimp farms are taking over – the saltwater providing the right environment to switch to aquaculture .

But , the ways they are being resilient now need to be sustainable into the future . How sustainable will aquaculture be ? If enough people convert and there is too much saline intrusion that could create new problems and distort the economy in ways people can not predict . ”
The art of re-routing water using earth walls to create artificial islands for farming is perhaps best-known as a Dutch initiative . People in Bangladesh have also taken to building polders , as they are known , to protect their farm land . However , tensions arise when some farmers want to protect their agricultural land , on which they are growing rice , from saltwater intrusion while neighbouring farmers might inundate their land with saltwater in order to start farming shrimp .
“ Anecdotes suggest that building sea walls and structures to keep the seawater out may be creating problems more than helping in that it creates conflict , ” says Chen . “ There are groups that want to allow more saltwater in to convert from agriculture to aquaculture . It benefits those that want to convert but not everyone is doing so . The seawater and levees allow more control which in some cases worsens the salinity problem . ”
Chen says there may now be 100,000 people migrating each year due to saltwater flooding , but it is hard to estimate accurately because the changing wider economy is also affecting migration . A strong economy in India attracts workers , too , who often seek construction or agricultural work .

Lectures and rallies took place at more than 2,000 college campuses , 10,000 elementary and high schools , and thousands of other places across the country . Forty-two states adopted resolutions endorsing Earth Day , and Congress recessed so that legislators could participate in the activities in their districts . It is sometimes described as , up to that time , the largest public demonstration in history .
The lectures and literature surrounding the event featured lots of dismal predictions about the future . One such compendium of doom was The Environmental Handbook , whose cover noted that it had been `` prepared for the first national environmental teach-in . '' Commissioned by the group Friends of the Earth , the book preached the perils of rising population and imminent depletion of nonrenewable resources . Many of its contributors—let 's call them the Catastrophists—warned that even such drastic actions as halving the number of human beings and stopping economic growth completely might not be enough to prevent the imminent ecological cataclysm .
A different group of researchers believed that while economic growth and technological progress had created some ecological problems , these things also would be a source of solutions . Let 's call these folks the Prometheans . The economist Theodore Schultz argued in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in 1972 that the expansion of modern agriculture would free up more land for nature . Other proponents of this more sanguine outlook included the oceanographer Cy Adler , the economist Christopher Freeman , and Nature editor emeritus John Maddox , author of the 1972 book The Doomsday Syndrome .
Today , the Earth Day Network hopes a billion people across the world will participate in Earth Day 2020 , where the 50th anniversary focus will be on man-made climate change . Living as we do in the future that the Catastrophists and the Prometheans were forecasting , now is a great time to look back at the claims made five decades ago . Which side had the abler prophets ?
In his contribution to The Environmental Handbook , an essay called `` The Limits of Adaptability , '' the biologist René Dubos claimed that `` the dangers posed by overpopulation are more grave and more immediate in the U.S. than in less industrialized countries . This is due in part to the fact that each U.S. citizen uses more of the world 's natural resources than any other human being and destroys them more rapidly , thereby contributing massively to the pollution of his own surroundings and of the earth as a whole . ''
Handbook editor Garrett De Bell 's essay claimed that overpopulation was the biggest ███ for mankind 's increasing use of pollution-causing energy sources . While `` population control will take time , '' De Bell argued , we could get a start on a solution `` by ceasing to use power for trivial purposes . '' Specifically , the prices for energy supplies should be so scaled as to discourage people from using such `` abundant luxuries '' as blenders , can openers , power saws , mowers , clothes dryers , air conditioners , hair dryers—and cars , of course : `` If you wanted to design a transportation system to waste the earth 's energy reserves and pollute the air as much as possible , you could n't do much better than our present system dominated by the automobile . ''
De Bell also noted that burning fossil fuels was increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere . `` Scientists are becoming worried about increasing CO2 levels because of the greenhouse effect , with its possible repercussions on the world climate , '' he wrote . Reducing energy use in the U.S. by 25 percent during the following decade could be a start toward `` preventing disastrous climatic changes . ''
In their contribution to the Handbook , political scientist Robert Rienow and his wife , author Leona Train Rienow , declared that `` a New Yorker on the street took into his lungs the equivalent in toxic materials of 38 cigarettes a day . '' Although factories and residential heating contributed to urban smog , automobiles were the biggest culprits : `` While cars get faster and longer , lives get slower and shorter . While Chrysler competes with Buick for the getaway , cancer competes with emphysema for the layaway . This generation is indeed going to have to choose between humans and the automobile . Perhaps most families have too many of both . ''
The book 's most urgent vision of imminent global environmental disaster was courtesy of the Stanford biologist Paul Ehrlich . He sketched a scenario in which devastating famines would kill tens of millions of people in Asia , Africa , and Latin America by the end of the 1970s , and smog disasters in Los Angeles and New York would kill 200,000 Americans in 1973 . Warning that `` America 's resource situation was bad and bound to get worse , '' he dismissed `` cornucopian economists '' by imagining future congressional hearings in which a `` distinguished geologist from the University of California '' would urge that `` economists be legally required to learn at least the most elementary facts of geology . ''
Ehrlich 's essay was not a prediction for how the 1970s would literally unfold . But it was obviously designed to scare people about the impending ecological apocalypse , and it did conclude with an actual prediction : `` Most of the people who are going to die in the greatest cataclysm in the history of man have already been born . '' He added that by 1975 , `` some experts feel that food shortages will have escalated the present level of world hunger and starvation into famines of unbelievable proportions . Other experts , more optimistic , think the ultimate food-population collision will not occur until the decade of the 1980s . ''
`` Population will inevitably and completely outstrip whatever small increases in food supplies we make , '' Ehrlich confidently declared in the April 1970 issue of Mademoiselle . `` The death rate will increase until at least 100–200 million people per year will be starving to death during the next ten years . ''
Harrison Brown of the National Academy of Sciences published a chart in the September 1970 issue of Scientific American projecting that humanity would run out of copper shortly after 2000 ; lead , zinc , tin , gold , and silver would be gone before 1990 . Brown claimed that his estimates took into account the possibilities that `` new reserves will be discovered by exploration or created by innovation . '' The February 2 , 1970 , issue of Time quoted the ecologist Kenneth Watt : `` By the year 2000 , if present trends continue , we will be using up crude oil at such a rate…that there wo n't be any more crude oil . ''
And in January 1970 , Life magazine warned : `` In a decade , urban dwellers will have to wear gas masks to survive air pollution . ''
People in developed countries `` have been assailed by prophecies of calamity , '' Maddox wrote in The Doomsday Syndrome . `` To some , population growth is the most immediate threat . Others make more of pollution of various kinds , the risk that the world will run out food or natural resources or even the possibility that economic growth and the prosperity it brings spell danger for the human race . ''
The trajectories Maddox foresaw for population and food production differed dramatically from those predicted by the Catastrophists . Technologically advanced rich countries , he noted , had undergone a demographic transition from the Malthusian past of high fertility/high mortality societies to a high fertility/low mortality combination . But this , he argued , was a temporary stage ; we were already entering a population-stabilizing low fertility/low mortality state . `` Although the demographic transition has only just begun in large parts of the developing world , there is every ███ to expect that it will produce demographic stability entirely comparable with that which now exists in Western Europe and elsewhere in the industrialized world , '' he concluded . `` The population explosion has all the signs of being a damp squib . ''
Food production , meanwhile , was `` now increasing much faster than population . '' During the 1960s , Maddox observed , it grew at 2.7 percent annually , handily outstripping the global population growth rate of 2 percent a year . In India and Southeast Asia , food production was increasing at 4 percent annually , about double their population growth rates . And further improvements were possible .
With regard to energy , Maddox cited estimates from 1970 that `` there are more , but not much more , than 300,000 million tons of petroleum [ about 2.1 trillion barrels ] still to be extracted from the ground . '' At the then-current rate of extraction of 15 billion barrels annually , he calculated that supplies would last for 135 years .
And other natural resources ? `` Techniques for exploration and extraction of metals seem to have kept ahead of scarcity , '' he observed . Consequently , supplies of metals `` are becoming economically more plentiful , not more scarce . ''
Maddox fully acknowledged that pollution was harming people and the natural world . Cutting air pollution in the U.S. by 50 percent , he said , would increase life expectancy by three to five years . But he did not think pollution threatened the very existence of the human race . It was , he argued , an open-access commons problem that could be solved through technology and sensible public policy . In 60 American cities , he pointed out , average levels of smokiness had already declined by 20 percent from 1957 to 1970 ; sulfur dioxide had fallen by a third from 1962 to 1969 .
Noting that burning fossil fuels was increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , Maddox calculated that CO2 would increase by 15 percent by 2000 . That is , in fact , what happened . He also predicted that that rise would result in `` an increase of the temperature on the surface of the earth by something like one-half degree centigrade . '' That was also just about right .
Finally , `` if it turns out that the scale of industrial activity is so great that the accumulation of carbon dioxide threatens climate change , '' Maddox wrote , the same ingenuity that was reducing other forms of pollution `` could be applied to regulate the concentration of the gas . To be sure , such an intervention would require expensive and historically important changes in industrial practices , but calamity is avoidable . ''
The bottom line for Maddox was that `` technology and prosperity are not the inherent nuisances of which environmentalists continually complain , but rather , the means by which a better environment could be created . ''
World population has increased since 1970 , though at a lower rate than predicted by the Catastrophists . At the time of the first Earth Day , there were 3.7 billion people on Earth ; that has now risen to 7.6 billion . On the other hand , the global total fertility rate back then was 4.8 children per woman ; it has now plummeted to 2.4 . In 83 countries—including the United States—fertility is below the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman . Those 83 countries represent half the world 's population . Wolfgang Lutz , a demographer at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis , projects that world population will peak in this century and then begin to fall .
Though our population doubled , those globe-spanning famines did not occur . Instead , world food production more than tripled , with average per-capita calories supplied rising from around 2,400 to nearly 3,000 per day . In the U.S. , corn yields since 1970 have grown from about 60 bushels per acre to nearly 170 now . Modern agriculture is becoming so productive that the Rockefeller University researcher Jesse Ausubel thinks humanity is at the cusp of `` peak farmland , '' and that our total use of land for agriculture will soon begin to decline .
Meanwhile , Maddox appears to have been too conservative—not too optimistic—in his beliefs about global petroleum resources . In 2014 , the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated the total amount of technically recoverable petroleum at about 3.4 trillion barrels .
Just as the world did not run out of oil , it did not run out of copper , lead , zinc , tin , gold , or silver . In 1974 , the total world reserves of copper amounted to 417 million tons . The U.S. Geological Survey reports that in 2019 , world copper reserves stood at 830 million tons . In 1974 , world lead reserves were 132 million tons . In 2019 , they were 83 million tons . Zinc reserves went from 236 million tons to 230 million tons . Tin reserves moved from 10 million tons to 4.7 million tons . Gold reserves rose from 41,000 tons to 54,000 tons . Silver reserves moved up from 187,000 tons to 560,000 tons .
As you may have noticed , city dwellers in developed countries are not wearing gas masks as they go about their daily lives . As forecast by Maddox , urban air was cleared using technology and the `` vigorous application of social instruments , laws , and taxes . '' From 1970 to 2018 , the Environmental Protection Agency reports , America 's combined emissions of six key air pollutants dropped by 74 percent , even as the U.S. economy grew by 275 percent . The United Kingdom and the European Union have likewise experienced steep declines in air pollution .
Surface water pollution has also been reduced . Based on 14.6 million pollution readings at 265,000 monitoring sites between 1972 and 2014 , the EPA reports that in 1972 , 30 percent of tested surface waters in the United States did not meet the fishable standard ( thriving habitats for fish that are safe to eat ) ; only 15 percent failed that standard in 2014 .
Both Catastrophist De Bell and Promethean Maddox worried about the possible climatic effects of rising atmospheric concentrations of carbon . Indeed , the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased by 25 percent , from 328 parts per million in April 1970 to 412 parts per million today . Since the first Earth Day , the globe 's average temperature has increased by about 1 degree Celsius , and recent research suggests that the world is on track to increase by another 2 degrees Celsius by the end of this century .
De Bell responded to climate change by recommending energy austerity , while Maddox argued that the same human ingenuity that was solving other air pollution problems could be brought to bear on greenhouse warming . Given how thoroughly economic growth and sci-tech prowess have falsified the Catastrophists ' other forecasts , it 's not implausible that those same forces will let us surmount the problems posed by climate change too .
In his 1967 book The Sense of an Ending , the literary critic Frank Kermode argued that human beings try to give significance to our short lives in the long sweep of history by placing ourselves in the middle of a narrative arc . That arc typically traces civilization 's fall from a golden age through a current stage of decadence to an impending apocalypse—one that may , through the bold efforts of the current generation , usher in a new age .
`` The great majority of interpretations of Apocalypse assume that the End is pretty near , '' observed Kermode . But since the end never arrives , `` the historical allegory is always having to be revised….And this is important . Apocalypse can be disconfirmed without being discredited . This is part of its extraordinary resilience . ''
The dire prophecies of the first Earth Day have been mostly proven wrong , but the prophets of an always-impending environmental apocalypse have not thereby been discredited . Auguries of imminent catastrophe remain resilient , even as the world of 2020 is in a much happier state than the Catastrophists of 1970 ever expected .","About 20 million Americans turned out for the first Earth Day on April 22, 1970. Lectures and rallies took place at more than 2,000 college campuses, 10,000 elementary and high schools, and thousands of other places across the country. Forty-two states adopted resolutions endorsing Earth Day, and Congress recessed so that legislators could participate in the activities in their districts. It is sometimes described as, up to that time, the largest public demonstration in history.

The lectures and literature surrounding the event featured lots of dismal predictions about the future. One such compendium of doom was The Environmental Handbook, whose cover noted that it had been ""prepared for the first national environmental teach-in."" Commissioned by the group Friends of the Earth, the book preached the perils of rising population and imminent depletion of nonrenewable resources. Many of its contributors—let's call them the Catastrophists—warned that even such drastic actions as halving the number of human beings and stopping economic growth completely might not be enough to prevent the imminent ecological cataclysm.

A different group of researchers believed that while economic growth and technological progress had created some ecological problems, these things also would be a source of solutions. Let's call these folks the Prometheans. The economist Theodore Schultz argued in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in 1972 that the expansion of modern agriculture would free up more land for nature. Other proponents of this more sanguine outlook included the oceanographer Cy Adler, the economist Christopher Freeman, and Nature editor emeritus John Maddox, author of the 1972 book The Doomsday Syndrome.

Today, the Earth Day Network hopes a billion people across the world will participate in Earth Day 2020, where the 50th anniversary focus will be on man-made climate change. Living as we do in the future that the Catastrophists and the Prometheans were forecasting, now is a great time to look back at the claims made five decades ago. Which side had the abler prophets?

The Catastrophists

In his contribution to The Environmental Handbook, an essay called ""The Limits of Adaptability,"" the biologist René Dubos claimed that ""the dangers posed by overpopulation are more grave and more immediate in the U.S. than in less industrialized countries. This is due in part to the fact that each U.S. citizen uses more of the world's natural resources than any other human being and destroys them more rapidly, thereby contributing massively to the pollution of his own surroundings and of the earth as a whole.""

Handbook editor Garrett De Bell's essay claimed that overpopulation was the biggest reason for mankind's increasing use of pollution-causing energy sources. While ""population control will take time,"" De Bell argued, we could get a start on a solution ""by ceasing to use power for trivial purposes."" Specifically, the prices for energy supplies should be so scaled as to discourage people from using such ""abundant luxuries"" as blenders, can openers, power saws, mowers, clothes dryers, air conditioners, hair dryers—and cars, of course: ""If you wanted to design a transportation system to waste the earth's energy reserves and pollute the air as much as possible, you couldn't do much better than our present system dominated by the automobile.""

De Bell also noted that burning fossil fuels was increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. ""Scientists are becoming worried about increasing CO2 levels because of the greenhouse effect, with its possible repercussions on the world climate,"" he wrote. Reducing energy use in the U.S. by 25 percent during the following decade could be a start toward ""preventing disastrous climatic changes.""

In their contribution to the Handbook, political scientist Robert Rienow and his wife, author Leona Train Rienow, declared that ""a New Yorker on the street took into his lungs the equivalent in toxic materials of 38 cigarettes a day."" Although factories and residential heating contributed to urban smog, automobiles were the biggest culprits: ""While cars get faster and longer, lives get slower and shorter. While Chrysler competes with Buick for the getaway, cancer competes with emphysema for the layaway. This generation is indeed going to have to choose between humans and the automobile. Perhaps most families have too many of both.""

The book's most urgent vision of imminent global environmental disaster was courtesy of the Stanford biologist Paul Ehrlich. He sketched a scenario in which devastating famines would kill tens of millions of people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America by the end of the 1970s, and smog disasters in Los Angeles and New York would kill 200,000 Americans in 1973. Warning that ""America's resource situation was bad and bound to get worse,"" he dismissed ""cornucopian economists"" by imagining future congressional hearings in which a ""distinguished geologist from the University of California"" would urge that ""economists be legally required to learn at least the most elementary facts of geology.""

Ehrlich's essay was not a prediction for how the 1970s would literally unfold. But it was obviously designed to scare people about the impending ecological apocalypse, and it did conclude with an actual prediction: ""Most of the people who are going to die in the greatest cataclysm in the history of man have already been born."" He added that by 1975, ""some experts feel that food shortages will have escalated the present level of world hunger and starvation into famines of unbelievable proportions. Other experts, more optimistic, think the ultimate food-population collision will not occur until the decade of the 1980s.""

""Population will inevitably and completely outstrip whatever small increases in food supplies we make,"" Ehrlich confidently declared in the April 1970 issue of Mademoiselle. ""The death rate will increase until at least 100–200 million people per year will be starving to death during the next ten years.""

Harrison Brown of the National Academy of Sciences published a chart in the September 1970 issue of Scientific American projecting that humanity would run out of copper shortly after 2000; lead, zinc, tin, gold, and silver would be gone before 1990. Brown claimed that his estimates took into account the possibilities that ""new reserves will be discovered by exploration or created by innovation."" The February 2, 1970, issue of Time quoted the ecologist Kenneth Watt: ""By the year 2000, if present trends continue, we will be using up crude oil at such a rate…that there won't be any more crude oil.""

And in January 1970, Life magazine warned: ""In a decade, urban dwellers will have to wear gas masks to survive air pollution.""

The Prometheans

People in developed countries ""have been assailed by prophecies of calamity,"" Maddox wrote in The Doomsday Syndrome. ""To some, population growth is the most immediate threat. Others make more of pollution of various kinds, the risk that the world will run out food or natural resources or even the possibility that economic growth and the prosperity it brings spell danger for the human race.""

The trajectories Maddox foresaw for population and food production differed dramatically from those predicted by the Catastrophists. Technologically advanced rich countries, he noted, had undergone a demographic transition from the Malthusian past of high fertility/high mortality societies to a high fertility/low mortality combination. But this, he argued, was a temporary stage; we were already entering a population-stabilizing low fertility/low mortality state. ""Although the demographic transition has only just begun in large parts of the developing world, there is every reason to expect that it will produce demographic stability entirely comparable with that which now exists in Western Europe and elsewhere in the industrialized world,"" he concluded. ""The population explosion has all the signs of being a damp squib.""

Food production, meanwhile, was ""now increasing much faster than population."" During the 1960s, Maddox observed, it grew at 2.7 percent annually, handily outstripping the global population growth rate of 2 percent a year. In India and Southeast Asia, food production was increasing at 4 percent annually, about double their population growth rates. And further improvements were possible.

With regard to energy, Maddox cited estimates from 1970 that ""there are more, but not much more, than 300,000 million tons of petroleum [about 2.1 trillion barrels] still to be extracted from the ground."" At the then-current rate of extraction of 15 billion barrels annually, he calculated that supplies would last for 135 years.

And other natural resources? ""Techniques for exploration and extraction of metals seem to have kept ahead of scarcity,"" he observed. Consequently, supplies of metals ""are becoming economically more plentiful, not more scarce.""

Maddox fully acknowledged that pollution was harming people and the natural world. Cutting air pollution in the U.S. by 50 percent, he said, would increase life expectancy by three to five years. But he did not think pollution threatened the very existence of the human race. It was, he argued, an open-access commons problem that could be solved through technology and sensible public policy. In 60 American cities, he pointed out, average levels of smokiness had already declined by 20 percent from 1957 to 1970; sulfur dioxide had fallen by a third from 1962 to 1969.

To be sure, such an intervention would require expensive and historically important changes in industrial practices, but calamity is avoidable.""

The bottom line for Maddox was that ""technology and prosperity are not the inherent nuisances of which environmentalists continually complain, but rather, the means by which a better environment could be created.""

Who Was More Right?

A presidential task force unveiled a report on how communities across the country can prepare for the effects of global warming . In all , the recommendations on “ climate preparedness and resilience ” could cost the federal government more than $ 100 billion to protect drinking water supplies , shore up coastlines against rising sea levels and take other preventive measures .
The recommendations and subsequent expenses are just two pieces of an ever-expanding slate of global-warming that is sure to come under the microscope when Republicans assume control of the Senate in January .
But legal analysts say the Republicans have little ammunition to fight back , short of shutting down the federal government to stop Environmental Protection Agency funding .
White House officials , keenly aware of the executive power Mr. Obama holds on the issue of climate change , openly mocked incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his Republican colleagues .
“ I believe the president will complete actions . It is a top priority of his and I don ’ t believe they can stop us , ” White House counselor John Podesta told reporters on a conference call Monday . “ Not withstanding Sen. McConnell making this a top priority to leave the status quo , to leave the air dirtier . ”
White House officials on Monday also detailed some the expenses associated with the task force recommendations , including $ 88 billion for North Atlantic states to protect against rising sea levels , $ 6 billion for Midwestern states to combat rising temperatures and $ 40 billion to improve California ’ s drinking water systems .
The report comes on the heels of other recent steps , including Mr. Obama ’ s greenhouse gas emissions deal with China . Under that agreement , the U.S. pledged to cut its emissions by at least 26 percent by 2025 , while China merely said it will cap emissions no later than 2030 .
To meet that goal , the administration is relying on its unprecedented restrictions on power plant pollution — regulations that have led to accusations of a “ war on coal ” — and new auto fuel-efficiency standards , among other steps .
Mr. Obama also is seeking $ 3 billion in taxpayer money to go toward a global climate fund aimed at helping developing nations boost their infrastructure .
Republicans appear ready to fight the president ’ s climate change agenda tooth and nail . After the GOP captured the Senate , Mr. McConnell , Kentucky Republican , said reining in the EPA would be a “ top priority . ”
“ They ’ ve been on a rampage all across the country . And I think coal is the most conspicuous example , but it ’ s happening in a lot of other areas and I think you ’ re going to see bipartisan support for trying to rein them in , ” he told an audience in Frankfort , Kentucky .
The larger climate change debate is intertwined with the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline , the approval of which could come up for a Senate vote as early as Tuesday . The House already has passed legislation deeming the pipeline approved .
The White House , however , has hinted the president will veto the bill .
A similar fate could await other Republican efforts to push back on Mr. Obama ’ s climate change goals , according to Thomas Lorenzen , a lawyer who until last year served in the Justice Department ’ s Environmental and Natural Resources Division , overseeing legal challenges to EPA rules and regulations .
“ It ’ s pretty hard to see how ” Republicans can stop the president , Mr. Lorenzen said . “ The problem is they don ’ t have a veto-proof majority . ”
Mr. Lorenzen said Republicans could seek to cut funding to the EPA ’ s implementation of controversial rules , such the power plant restrictions . But going down such a path could escalate quickly for Republicans .
“ How do you pass that in a way that it won ’ t be vetoed ? What you end up with is a potential [ government ] shutdown battle , ” Mr. Lorenzen said .
Lawsuits already have been filed challenging the EPA ’ s authority to limit emissions ; more are likely to be filed as regulations on existing power plants are finalized .
That kind of legal action represents the best hope of stopping the administration , analysts say .
Meanwhile , the White House tried Monday to erase the partisan atmosphere around its host of environmental regulations .
“ These issues really aren ’ t Republican or Democratic issues . They are issues that impact our citizens and our cities … It ’ s so important that we try , I think , to make this a nonpartisan issue , ” said James Brainard , the Republican mayor of Carmel , Indiana , and a member of the task force that presented its recommendations on Monday .","The White House forged ahead Monday with yet another piece of its climate change agenda and bragged that Republicans are powerless to stop it.

“I believe the president will complete actions. It is a top priority of his and I don’t believe they can stop us,” White House counselor John Podesta told reporters on a conference call Monday. “Not withstanding Sen. McConnell making this a top priority to leave the status quo, to leave the air dirtier.”

White House officials on Monday also detailed some the expenses associated with the task force recommendations, including $88 billion for North Atlantic states to protect against rising sea levels, $6 billion for Midwestern states to combat rising temperatures and $40 billion to improve California’s drinking water systems.

The report comes on the heels of other recent steps, including Mr. Obama’s greenhouse gas emissions deal with China. Under that agreement, the U.S. pledged to cut its emissions by at least 26 percent by 2025, while China merely said it will cap emissions no later than 2030.

To meet that goal, the administration is relying on its unprecedented restrictions on power plant pollution — regulations that have led to accusations of a “war on coal” — and new auto fuel-efficiency standards, among other steps.

Mr. Obama also is seeking $3 billion in taxpayer money to go toward a global climate fund aimed at helping developing nations boost their infrastructure.

Republicans appear ready to fight the president’s climate change agenda tooth and nail. After the GOP captured the Senate, Mr. McConnell, Kentucky Republican, said reining in the EPA would be a “top priority.”

He reiterated those comments over the weekend.

“They’ve been on a rampage all across the country. And I think coal is the most conspicuous example, but it’s happening in a lot of other areas and I think you’re going to see bipartisan support for trying to rein them in,” he told an audience in Frankfort, Kentucky.

The larger climate change debate is intertwined with the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline, the approval of which could come up for a Senate vote as early as Tuesday. The House already has passed legislation deeming the pipeline approved.

The White House, however, has hinted the president will veto the bill.

A similar fate could await other Republican efforts to push back on Mr. Obama’s climate change goals, according to Thomas Lorenzen, a lawyer who until last year served in the Justice Department’s Environmental and Natural Resources Division, overseeing legal challenges to EPA rules and regulations.

“It’s pretty hard to see how” Republicans can stop the president, Mr. Lorenzen said. “The problem is they don’t have a veto-proof majority.”

Mr. Lorenzen said Republicans could seek to cut funding to the EPA’s implementation of controversial rules, such the power plant restrictions. But going down such a path could escalate quickly for Republicans.

“How do you pass that in a way that it won’t be vetoed? What you end up with is a potential [government] shutdown battle,” Mr. Lorenzen said.

Lawsuits already have been filed challenging the EPA’s authority to limit emissions; more are likely to be filed as regulations on existing power plants are finalized.

That kind of legal action represents the best hope of stopping the administration, analysts say.

Meanwhile, the White House tried Monday to erase the partisan atmosphere around its host of environmental regulations.

“These issues really aren’t Republican or Democratic issues. They are issues that impact our citizens and our cities … It’s so important that we try, I think, to make this a nonpartisan issue,” said James Brainard, the Republican mayor of Carmel, Indiana, and a member of the task force that presented its recommendations on Monday.

Jet fuel-guzzling Delta Air Lines and fossil fuel-pumping BP are vowing to go carbon neutral.

Microsoft and Ikea, behemoths of tech and furniture, have pledged to go further and actively reduce the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The financial giant Blackrock promises to put climate at the heart of its decisions.

In short, a slew of major corporations are making promises on climate — lofty ones.

And it's not just a case of a few headline-grabbing outliers.

More companies are disclosing their carbon emissions, and more of those companies have emissions reductions targets, according to the global nonprofit CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project).

According to one analysis, the number of Fortune 500 companies with concrete, ambitious carbon targets quadrupled in the past four years, to 23%.

Growing pressure to act

This increase in activity comes after decades of pressure from environmental advocates — and despite a lack of action from the U.S. government.

So after all this time, what might be spurring companies to set new or newly ambitious targets?

For one thing, the effects of climate change are becoming clearer to companies as wildfires, rising sea levels, droughts and other symptoms of the crisis make headlines and affect business operations.

The limits of voluntary targets

Of course, setting a carbon budget is one thing. Sticking to it is another. Some climate announcements in the past — such as BP's previous rebranding as ""Beyond Petroleum"" — have been more PR push than actual shift in strategy, and advocates agree that follow-through and accountability will be essential if these new ambitious targets are to have an impact.

She's not the only one who looks at these voluntary commitments and sees a need for regulation. After all, some companies taking action is nowhere near enough to stop climate change.

[pullquote]

The IPCC became less pessimistic about climate change, although its press release would not tell you so.

The report also illustrates just how outmoded the IPCC has become since it was founded in 1988. Its reports are written over a period of three years, and finished months before publication.

When preparations started on AR5, the world hadn’t warmed for 13 years. That is a bit odd, if you believe the models, but not odd enough to merit a lot of attention.

By the time the report was finished, however, it hadn’t warmed for 17 years. That is decidedly odd, but hard to accommodate in a near-final draft that has been through three rounds of review.

After the report was finalized, but before it was published, a number of papers appeared with hypotheses about the pause in warming. AR5 was out of date before it was released.

The IPCC model – every six years a big splash of climate analysis – is broken.

Working Group 2, published in March, and focusing on the impacts of climate change, had a different problem. It lies at the heart of the previous IPCC controversy. The scientific literature now acknowledges that many of the more worrying impacts of climate change are in fact symptoms of social mismanagement and underdevelopment.

The first rule of climate policy should be: do no harm to economic growth. But the IPCC was asked to focus on the risks of climate change alone, and those who volunteered to be its authors eagerly obliged. There is even a groundbreaking section on emerging risks.

The first paper on an issue is always dramatic. That is the only way to get something onto the scientific agenda. Follow-up papers then pooh-pooh the initial drama. But the IPCC chose not to wait for those follow-up papers.

IPCC reports are often two to three thousand pages long, but there are two or three main findings only.

Authors who want to see their long hours of IPCC work recognized should thus present their impact as worse than the next one.

It was this inbuilt alarmism that made me step down from the team that drafted the Summary for Policy Makers of Working Group 2. And indeed, the report was greeted by the four horsemen of the apocalypse: famine, pestilence, war, death all made headlines.

April’s Working Group 3 had yet another problem. Its focus, climate policy, is a hot political debate in many countries.

The Summary for Policy Makers is drafted by academics, but approved line-by-line by government representatives. Every clause that could possibly be used against a government position, either in a domestic debate or in international negotiations, was neutered or removed.

But the authors are at fault, too. A little bit of emission reduction costs little. But as targets get more stringent, costs escalate. Not so according to the IPCC: Very ambitious targets are said to be only slightly more expensive than less ambitious targets.

This surprising finding is a statistical fluke. Emission reduction is easy according to some studies, which duly explore very ambitious targets.

Emission reduction is hard according to other studies; very ambitious targets are prohibitively expensive and results not reported.

The surprisingly low cost of meeting very stringent emission reduction targets is the result of selection bias.

Oddly, the IPCC made the same mistake in the previous report.

The final part of the AR5 report, the Synthesis, will be published in September. It will fail to offer policy makers what they need to know: a systematic comparison of the costs of climate policy to its benefits, the avoided impacts of climate change.

Compared to the most famous cost-benefit analysis of them all, the Stern Review, published in 2006, the IPCC finds that the impacts of climate change are lower and the impacts of climate policy higher. But the IPCC will not suggest that the emission reduction targets recommended by Stern – global emissions 25 percent below 2005 levels by 2050; stabilize warming at 2-3˚C – are, perhaps, too stringent.

Given its flaws, should the IPCC be disbanded? That would be pointless. Climate change is a problem of the future. Climate policy responds to forecasts of the future rather than measurements of the past.

There are large climate bureaucracies around the world, who exist by virtue of climate science. If you abolish the IPCC, the climatocracy will create a new IPCC. The IPCC should therefore be reformed.

Here are some suggestions:

He left after deciding that he was pushing “ weak and misleading ” science to buttress libertarian policies .
“ Climate skepticism is deeply rooted in the foundational priors on the right , ” says Jerry Taylor , president of the centrist Niskanen Center .
That the Heartland Institute calls itself a free-market think tank is telling : Climate denial in the U.S. is deeply rooted in an anti-government ideology that sees virtually all regulations , including curbs on carbon emissions , as leftist attacks on free enterprise .
“ What they ’ re trying to do is to destroy our way of life and they ’ re succeeding , ” one attendee at the Heartland Institute ’ s July conference in Washington , D.C. , told attendees .
After years of denying or deflecting mainstream climate science , a growing number of GOP lawmakers – from Lindsey Graham to Matt Gaetz – have begun to break ranks . But one faction in the conservative movement continues to push against such calls . They maintain that the agenda for climate action is part of a socialist plot to undermine the American way of life .
As public concern over global warming grows , more Republicans have begun to break ranks . After years of denying or deflecting mainstream climate science , GOP lawmakers are pivoting toward a belated acceptance of man-made warming and calling for bipartisan action to curb greenhouse gas emissions and boost investment in clean energy .
But one faction in the conservative movement continues to push against such calls with warnings that the agenda for climate action is part of a socialist plot to undermine the American way of life .
“ It ’ s a climate delusion . It ’ s a climate collusion , ” James Taylor , a senior fellow at the Heartland Institute , told an audience of around 250 gathered at the Trump International Hotel in Washington for the institute ’ s 13th International Conference on Climate Change in late July .
Other speakers argued that any warming of the Earth is part of a natural cycle and not the result of human activity , as record heat swept through Europe , toppling records in France , Belgium , Germany , and the Netherlands .
Chicago-based Heartland is part of a nesting group of right-wing organizations that for decades have sought to undermine public confidence in mainstream climate science . It publishes “ climate realist ” books and articles that find their way into Republican platforms and into the media , and has tried to push materials into schools .
That it calls itself a free-market think tank is telling : Climate denial in the U.S. is deeply rooted in an anti-government ideology that sees virtually all regulations , including curbs on carbon emissions , as leftist attacks on free enterprise .
To such ideologues the Green New Deal proposed by Democrats in Congress is proof of their long-standing fear that a climate crisis is an excuse to re-engineer the U.S. economy as a top-down system .
Jay Lehr , a groundwater hydrologist , assured the Heartland conference that carbon emissions had “ zero effect ” on planetary temperatures and oceanic levels . Accepting the 2019 Dauntless Purveyor of Climate Truth Award , he said capitalism was under assault . “ What they ’ re trying to do is to destroy our way of life and they ’ re succeeding . We ’ ve got to stop them , ” he said .
Critics say this blending of fringe science and free-market fundamentalism is the handmaiden of fossil fuel producers seeking to protect their economic interests . Peer-reviewed studies have tracked how oil companies and major donors like the Koch Family Foundations influence the agenda of climate-skeptic organizations .
But their agendas also express a particular worldview , says Jean-Daniel Collomb , a French academic who studies U.S. political thought . To U.S. libertarians , such as the Koch brothers , who own oil refineries and pipelines that would be affected by carbon pricing , opposition to climate regulations is both self-serving – and an ideological exigency .
“ They ’ re trying to salvage their profit margins but also to protect an approach to the economy that they favor , ” says Mr. Collomb , a professor of American studies at Jean Moulin University in Lyon , France . To take climate change seriously would be to open the door to a “ radical questioning of the way that you run your economy and the role of the government . ”
Moreover , “ nobody likes to admit that they ’ re wrong , ” says Jerry Taylor , president of the Niskanen Center in Washington , a centrist think tank .
He should know : In his former role as director of energy and environmental policy at the Cato Institute he took the skeptics ’ side , downplaying the risk of unchecked carbon emissions . He left Cato after 23 years in 2014 after deciding that he was pushing “ weak and misleading ” science to buttress libertarian policies . Now he favors carbon taxes and other market-based solutions .
“ Climate skepticism is deeply rooted in the foundational priors on the right , ” he says . “ If you accept the mainstream narrative about climate change it suggests a course of action that is anathema to people on the right . ”
Those people include James Taylor , the Heartland senior fellow , who is his brother . Jerry Taylor says he ’ s given up trying to persuade him to reconsider his views . “ He ’ s a guy who is rewarded for being a gunslinger in this debate , and so was I , ” he says .
This ideological battle sets the United States apart from other countries where climate science is settled fact . In Europe , for example , several far-right parties like Alternative for Germany and the U.K . Independence Party are climate deniers , but none are in power . Britain ’ s Conservative-run government recently committed to zero carbon emissions by mid-century .
By contrast , climate deniers have a powerful ally in the White House . President Donald Trump , who disputes man-made warming and lauds coal and other fossil fuels , tapped a Heartland associate , Myron Ebell , to lead his transition team at the Environmental Protection Agency . Mr. Ebell told the conference that a “ deep state ” was thwarting President Trump ’ s climate agenda .
“ I don ’ t do partisan politics , ” he said . “ But I would say this . ... All six of the [ Democratic ] Senators running for president are sponsors of the Green New Deal resolution . Virtually all of them have said they believe in keeping [ fossil fuels ] in the ground . ”
Delegates heard a more supportive message from Tom McClintock , a Republican congressman from California . He conceded that “ temperatures are gently rising ” and “ oceans are slowly rising ” in a speech that disparaged Democrats as “ Chicken Littles ” for seeking curbs on fossil fuels , an industry that has funded his electoral campaigns .
For all the invective , some experts see an ongoing shift in the climate debate in which Heartland may be a lagging indicator of political and social change .
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce , which in 2009 claimed that carbon accumulation was beneficial for the planet , recently called for action on global warming , which it framed as a response to its members ’ desire to seek “ sensible solutions ” to a reality that was affecting their businesses .
Others making a similar pivot include Frank Luntz , a GOP pollster and strategist , who told a Senate committee last week that he regretted his past work to help to stall action on climate . In 2001 , he advised Republicans to speak about climate change , not global warming , while also sowing doubt about the science that informed policy . Now he said the tide had turned .
“ Americans believe climate change is real , and that number goes up every single month , ” he told the Democrats ’ Special Committee on the Climate Crisis .
While there ’ s a partisan divide on climate-related opinion , younger Republicans are more likely to echo the concerns expressed by most Democrats about man-made warming and to support bipartisan solutions .

He left after deciding that he was pushing “weak and misleading” science to buttress libertarian policies.

“Climate skepticism is deeply rooted in the foundational priors on the right,” says Jerry Taylor, president of the centrist Niskanen Center.

That the Heartland Institute calls itself a free-market think tank is telling: Climate denial in the U.S. is deeply rooted in an anti-government ideology that sees virtually all regulations, including curbs on carbon emissions, as leftist attacks on free enterprise.

“What they’re trying to do is to destroy our way of life and they’re succeeding,” one attendee at the Heartland Institute’s July conference in Washington, D.C., told attendees.

After years of denying or deflecting mainstream climate science, a growing number of GOP lawmakers – from Lindsey Graham to Matt Gaetz – have begun to break ranks. But one faction in the conservative movement continues to push against such calls. They maintain that the agenda for climate action is part of a socialist plot to undermine the American way of life.

As public concern over global warming grows, more Republicans have begun to break ranks. After years of denying or deflecting mainstream climate science, GOP lawmakers are pivoting toward a belated acceptance of man-made warming and calling for bipartisan action to curb greenhouse gas emissions and boost investment in clean energy.

But one faction in the conservative movement continues to push against such calls with warnings that the agenda for climate action is part of a socialist plot to undermine the American way of life.

“It’s a climate delusion. It’s a climate collusion,” James Taylor, a senior fellow at the Heartland Institute, told an audience of around 250 gathered at the Trump International Hotel in Washington for the institute’s 13th International Conference on Climate Change in late July.

Other speakers argued that any warming of the Earth is part of a natural cycle and not the result of human activity, as record heat swept through Europe, toppling records in France, Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands.

Chicago-based Heartland is part of a nesting group of right-wing organizations that for decades have sought to undermine public confidence in mainstream climate science. It publishes “climate realist” books and articles that find their way into Republican platforms and into the media, and has tried to push materials into schools.

That it calls itself a free-market think tank is telling: Climate denial in the U.S. is deeply rooted in an anti-government ideology that sees virtually all regulations, including curbs on carbon emissions, as leftist attacks on free enterprise.

A socialist plot?

To such ideologues the Green New Deal proposed by Democrats in Congress is proof of their long-standing fear that a climate crisis is an excuse to re-engineer the U.S. economy as a top-down system.

Jay Lehr, a groundwater hydrologist, assured the Heartland conference that carbon emissions had “zero effect” on planetary temperatures and oceanic levels. Accepting the 2019 Dauntless Purveyor of Climate Truth Award, he said capitalism was under assault. “What they’re trying to do is to destroy our way of life and they’re succeeding. We’ve got to stop them,” he said.

Critics say this blending of fringe science and free-market fundamentalism is the handmaiden of fossil fuel producers seeking to protect their economic interests. Peer-reviewed studies have tracked how oil companies and major donors like the Koch Family Foundations influence the agenda of climate-skeptic organizations.

But their agendas also express a particular worldview, says Jean-Daniel Collomb, a French academic who studies U.S. political thought. To U.S. libertarians, such as the Koch brothers, who own oil refineries and pipelines that would be affected by carbon pricing, opposition to climate regulations is both self-serving – and an ideological exigency.

“They’re trying to salvage their profit margins but also to protect an approach to the economy that they favor,” says Mr. Collomb, a professor of American studies at Jean Moulin University in Lyon, France. To take climate change seriously would be to open the door to a “radical questioning of the way that you run your economy and the role of the government.”

Moreover, “nobody likes to admit that they’re wrong,” says Jerry Taylor, president of the Niskanen Center in Washington, a centrist think tank.

He should know: In his former role as director of energy and environmental policy at the Cato Institute he took the skeptics’ side, downplaying the risk of unchecked carbon emissions. He left Cato after 23 years in 2014 after deciding that he was pushing “weak and misleading” science to buttress libertarian policies. Now he favors carbon taxes and other market-based solutions.

“Climate skepticism is deeply rooted in the foundational priors on the right,” he says. “If you accept the mainstream narrative about climate change it suggests a course of action that is anathema to people on the right.”

Those people include James Taylor, the Heartland senior fellow, who is his brother. Jerry Taylor says he’s given up trying to persuade him to reconsider his views. “He’s a guy who is rewarded for being a gunslinger in this debate, and so was I,” he says.

A uniquely American challenge

This ideological battle sets the United States apart from other countries where climate science is settled fact. In Europe, for example, several far-right parties like Alternative for Germany and the U.K. Independence Party are climate deniers, but none are in power. Britain’s Conservative-run government recently committed to zero carbon emissions by mid-century.

By contrast, climate deniers have a powerful ally in the White House. President Donald Trump, who disputes man-made warming and lauds coal and other fossil fuels, tapped a Heartland associate, Myron Ebell, to lead his transition team at the Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Ebell told the conference that a “deep state” was thwarting President Trump’s climate agenda.

“I don’t do partisan politics,” he said. “But I would say this. ... All six of the [Democratic] Senators running for president are sponsors of the Green New Deal resolution. Virtually all of them have said they believe in keeping [fossil fuels] in the ground.”

Delegates heard a more supportive message from Tom McClintock, a Republican congressman from California. He conceded that “temperatures are gently rising” and “oceans are slowly rising” in a speech that disparaged Democrats as “Chicken Littles” for seeking curbs on fossil fuels, an industry that has funded his electoral campaigns.

For all the invective, some experts see an ongoing shift in the climate debate in which Heartland may be a lagging indicator of political and social change.

A shifting tide

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which in 2009 claimed that carbon accumulation was beneficial for the planet, recently called for action on global warming, which it framed as a response to its members’ desire to seek “sensible solutions” to a reality that was affecting their businesses.

Others making a similar pivot include Frank Luntz, a GOP pollster and strategist, who told a Senate committee last week that he regretted his past work to help to stall action on climate. In 2001, he advised Republicans to speak about climate change, not global warming, while also sowing doubt about the science that informed policy. Now he said the tide had turned.

“Americans believe climate change is real, and that number goes up every single month,” he told the Democrats’ Special Committee on the Climate Crisis.

While there’s a partisan divide on climate-related opinion, younger Republicans are more likely to echo the concerns expressed by most Democrats about man-made warming and to support bipartisan solutions. In April, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said that clean-energy policy could be a winner for Republicans. “If you want this party to grow – people from 18 to 35 believe in climate change whether you do or not,” he told an Earth Day event in Dallas.

Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican and staunch Trump ally, has also tried to put a conservative stamp on climate policy with his “Green Real Deal,” which he introduced in the U.S. Congress in April. More Republicans in Florida have begun to work across the aisle on climate change, an issue that has grown increasingly salient in their flooding-prone state.

That demographic was largely absent from the Heartland conference, which drew a mix of retired scientists and engineers, conservative and libertarian activists, corporate lobbyists, and businesspeople. Attendees of previous conferences said this one was fairly modest compared to lavish multiday events held in New York and Las Vegas.

A “gentler” form of denial?

Not all “climate realists” at Heartland reject man-made warming, though they hotly dispute the scale and the likely effects. Even those who grudgingly accepted warming, however, were quick to offer up political and economic reasons for the U.S. not to curb fossil fuels.

“Their models don’t work. The world is not falling apart. The world is not coming to an end. That’s one argument,” says Steve Milloy, a lawyer and longtime consultant for tobacco and coal companies.

“The other argument is the impracticality and the politics [of climate taxes]. Who wants to pay for all of this?” he asks.

Expect more such lines of attack from groups like Heartland that are losing the public battle over global warming, says Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University and author of several books on the climate-denial industry.

Climate change is affecting nearly everything. It's displacing entire cultures, posing challenges to our health, weakening our economies and threatening our national security.

The question we face as journalists who chronicle the state of the planet is stark: Will we write a new chapter in the progress of humankind? Or will we write the obituary of Earth?

As world leaders meet in Paris this month for the U.N. Climate Change Conference, it appears, thankfully, that the years of dithering and denial finally may be behind us.

Pope Francis has called climate change ""one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day."" Ten of the largest oil and gas companies in the world, from BP to Shell to Saudi Aramco, have expressed support for climate reforms.

It is critical that we build on this momentum.

For all the talk of alternative energy technologies, ultimately, the most important source of energy is all of us. That's why all of us -- individuals, businesses and governments -- have a responsibility to fix the problems we have caused.

Take personal consumption. It's easy to assume that one person can't affect our warming world, and that's part of what makes climate change such a daunting issue to tackle. But one person can make a difference.

Leaving your car at home twice a week can cut 2 tons of carbon emissions annually. If the average American family did laundry with cold water, that could save 1,600 pounds of CO2 a year.

Wildfire Called Deadliest In Decades,2013-07-01,Bill Chappell,"In what is being called the deadliest U.S. wildfire in at least 30 years , an out-of-control blaze trapped and killed 19 firefighters Sunday in central Arizona . They had been forced to use temporary shelters in an attempt to survive .
All of those killed were part of the Granite Mountain Hotshots , an elite group based in Prescott , Ariz. , that uses rigorous training to prepare for fighting wildfires . They are frequently deployed to the front lines of firefighting efforts against such blazes .
The city of Prescott , Ariz. , has named the 19 firefighters killed Sunday . They are :

A reported 29 firefighters died in the Griffith Park fire .
Update at 11:25 a.m . ET : Fire Grows To More Than 8,000 Acres
The latest information we have from the incident management team handling the Yarnell Hill fire is that the wildfire grew to 8,374 acres as of this morning . The fire 's containment is listed as zero .
And conditions today wo n't help . Local forecasts call for humidity below 20 percent , temperatures approaching 100 degrees , and wind gusts .
Firefighters are continuing to fight the blaze , supported by air tankers and helicopters dropping fire retardant and water . Emergency officials say that four more hotshot crews are on their way to help .
The Yarnell Hill Fire started Friday near the town of Yarnell , about 85 miles northwest of Phoenix . The cause is under investigation , but many news outlets are reporting that the fire may have been sparked by a lightning strike . The blaze grew quickly and erratically , spreading from 2,000 acres to 6,000 acres as of late Sunday night . The flames have destroyed at least 50 structures .
Monday morning , the local Daily Courier said simply , `` Prescott is mourning . ''
The loss has led to the creation of a Facebook page honoring those killed by the fire over the weekend . As of this morning , more than 100,000 people had liked the page , with many people , including Arizona Gov . Jan Brewer , writing in with their condolences .
Hotshot crews often have about 20 members . Cut off from safety , the firefighters tried to use personal emergency shelters — sort of a cross between a tent and a sleeping bag — to survive .
`` They 're a last-ditch effort . They 're something that we train on , but it 's not something that we rely on , in any case , '' Prescott Fire Department spokesman Wade Ward tells Fox 10 News . `` The only thing that we can say is that it must have been a very unbearable situation and a last resort , '' he added , noting the firefighters ' training and awareness of conditions .
`` Emotionally , we 're devastated . We just lost 19 of some of the finest people you 'll ever meet , '' Prescott fire chief Dan Fraijo says . `` I mean , right now , we 're in crisis . ''
Incident Commander Mike Reichling tells ABC 15 what helped make the Yarnell fire so dangerous :
`` This fire was very radical in its behavior , the fuels were very dry , the relative humidity was low , the wind was coming out of the south , it turned around on us because of monsoon action this afternoon . That 's what caused the deaths , the change in the radical behavior of the burning fuels . ''
The Arizona Republic puts the loss in historic perspective , reporting that `` the Sunday incident is believed to be the deadliest firefighting toll in a wildfire since 1933 , and the deadliest single event for firefighters since the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . ''
The Granite Mountain Hotshots had worked on the nearby Doce fire in June , according to the Courier . It also fought fires in New Mexico this year .
In a statement issued by the White House early Monday , President Obama called the fallen firefighters heroes .
`` Yesterday , nineteen firefighters were killed in the line of duty while fighting a wildfire outside Yarnell , Arizona . They were heroes — highly skilled professionals who , like so many across our country do every day , selflessly put themselves in harm 's way to protect the lives and property of fellow citizens they would never meet . In recent days , hundreds of firefighters have battled extremely dangerous blazes across Arizona and the Southwest . The federal government is already assisting , and we will remain in close contact with state and local officials to provide the support they need . But today , Michelle and I join all Americans in sending our thoughts and prayers to the families of these brave firefighters and all whose lives have been upended by this terrible tragedy . ''

The loss has led to the creation of a Facebook page honoring those killed by the fire over the weekend. As of this morning, more than 100,000 people had liked the page, with many people, including Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, writing in with their condolences.

Hotshot crews often have about 20 members. Cut off from safety, the firefighters tried to use personal emergency shelters — sort of a cross between a tent and a sleeping bag — to survive.

""They're a last-ditch effort. They're something that we train on, but it's not something that we rely on, in any case,"" Prescott Fire Department spokesman Wade Ward tells Fox 10 News. ""The only thing that we can say is that it must have been a very unbearable situation and a last resort,"" he added, noting the firefighters' training and awareness of conditions.

""Emotionally, we're devastated. We just lost 19 of some of the finest people you'll ever meet,"" Prescott fire chief Dan Fraijo says. ""I mean, right now, we're in crisis.""

Incident Commander Mike Reichling tells ABC 15 what helped make the Yarnell fire so dangerous:

""This fire was very radical in its behavior, the fuels were very dry, the relative humidity was low, the wind was coming out of the south, it turned around on us because of monsoon action this afternoon. That's what caused the deaths, the change in the radical behavior of the burning fuels.""

The Arizona Republic puts the loss in historic perspective, reporting that ""the Sunday incident is believed to be the deadliest firefighting toll in a wildfire since 1933, and the deadliest single event for firefighters since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.""

The Granite Mountain Hotshots had worked on the nearby Doce fire in June, according to the Courier. It also fought fires in New Mexico this year.

In a statement issued by the White House early Monday, President Obama called the fallen firefighters heroes.

Here's the president's statement:

""Yesterday, nineteen firefighters were killed in the line of duty while fighting a wildfire outside Yarnell, Arizona. They were heroes — highly skilled professionals who, like so many across our country do every day, selflessly put themselves in harm's way to protect the lives and property of fellow citizens they would never meet. In recent days, hundreds of firefighters have battled extremely dangerous blazes across Arizona and the Southwest. The federal government is already assisting, and we will remain in close contact with state and local officials to provide the support they need. But today, Michelle and I join all Americans in sending our thoughts and prayers to the families of these brave firefighters and all whose lives have been upended by this terrible tragedy.""

Officials are promising an investigation into what happened.

The president’s top climate appointees and the outside advisers best positioned to shape his agenda are a team replete with heavy hitters — including green-minded business leaders, buttoned-down environmental lobbyists and bureaucrats who have spent years wrestling with the minutiae of regulations.

At the outset, the group might be light in executives from the industries that would be most affected. Some of the CEOs the administration drew support from during Obama’s first term are leaving the business or moving on to other things.

Still, energy insiders overall say these types of climate thinkers can help Obama advance a second-term strategy that relies on dribbling out regulations and industry-specific agreements with less focus on pushing legislation through Congress.

“There are two types of people who can be influential here,” said Manik Roy, vice president for strategic outreach at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, whose 30-year environmental career includes stops at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Hill. “Those who will shape the options that the president faces — how ambitious will the emission standard be, what the timing of it will be, that sort of thing — and those who will help the president decide whether to go forward with a given option.”

Here are several crucial players in the climate debate:

1. Denis McDonough

The president’s green brain trust starts with his chief of staff — best known as the former deputy national security adviser whom the president described last month as “one of my closest, most trusted advisers.”

Less well known is the fact that Denis McDonough has spoken for years about the urgency of tackling global warming and assuring supporters that Obama’s heart is in it.

Obama “recognizes very clearly that this is an urgent problem that we’ve now lost far too much time in addressing,” McDonough said during a May 2007 discussion hosted by the Brookings Institution, speaking as a campaign surrogate. Inserting a personal touch, the Minnesota native noted, “When I was home at the holidays, there was no ice fishing this year for the first time that I can remember in a long time.”

The same year, he co-wrote an op-ed for the Center for American Progress on the “obligation” the U.S. and other wealthy countries owe to help poor nations cope with climate change.

As chief of staff, McDonough will help Obama navigate the hugely symbolic decision on whether to approve TransCanada’s Keystone XL oil pipeline, a lightning rod for green critics. He’ll also oversee the rollout of EPA greenhouse gas regulations, one of several ways the administration can move forward without Congress.

( Also on POLITICO: Obama words turn up Keystone heat)

McDonough might also have a role in choosing who gets the reins of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which signs off on EPA rules. Former OIRA Administrator Cass Sunstein, who had a reputation for slow-walking regulations, left in August.

More broadly, McDonough can ensure that climate retains a prime spot in the president’s inbox — much the way former chief of staff Rahm Emanuel and former senior adviser David Axelrod helped steer the health care agenda in Obama’s first two years.

A judge has handed Exxon Mobil a victory in only the second climate change lawsuit to reach trial in the United States. The decision was a blow for the New York Attorney General's Office, which brought the case.

Justice Barry Ostrager of the New York State Supreme Court said that the attorney general failed to prove that the oil giant broke the law.

""Nothing in this opinion is intended to absolve ExxonMobil from responsibility for contributing to climate change through the emission of greenhouse gasses in the production of its fossil fuel products,"" Ostranger wrote. But, he added, ""this is a securities fraud case, not a climate change case.""

In a three-week trial, New York state prosecutors argued that the oil company had downplayed the financial risks it faces from possible climate regulation. Attorney General Letitia James said doing so made Exxon's assets appear more secure than they really were, which in turn affected its share price and defrauded investors.

Ostrager concluded that James' office ""failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that ExxonMobil made any material misrepresentations that 'would have been viewed by a reasonable investor as having significantly altered the ""total mix"" of information made available.' ""

James released a statement following the verdict, saying that the case had compelled Exxon ""to answer publicly for their internal decisions that misled investors.""

""Throughout this case, we laid out how Exxon made materially false, misleading, and confusing representations to the American people about the company's response to climate change regulations,"" James said.

""Exxon's inability to tell the truth further underscores the lies that have been sold to the American public for decades,"" she said. ""Despite this decision, we will continue to fight to ensure companies are held responsible for actions that undermine and jeopardize the financial health and safety of Americans across our country, and we will continue to fight to end climate change.""

The court agreed that the Attorney General failed to make a case, even with the extremely low threshold of the Martin Act in its favor.""

""Lawsuits that waste millions of dollars of taxpayer money do nothing to advance meaningful actions that reduce the risks of climate change,"" the company said.

There were signs of weakness in the state's case. On the last day of the trial, the attorney general's office withdrew two counts of fraud from its lawsuit. Exxon asked the judge to rule on those counts anyway, saying the state had tarnished the company's reputation in making its case on them.

The state went forward with two counts based on the Martin Act, a New York statute that grants the state's attorney general the authority to pursue investigations and actions against those it suspects of securities fraud.

MANNY: Water crisis in Flint is just the tip of the iceberg,2016-01-20,Manny Alvarez,"The water crisis in Flint , Mich. , is just the tip of the iceberg – and if you think that it can ’ t happen in your community , you ’ re sadly mistaken . The aging water infrastructure in this country is deeply flawed . Many of the 150,000 public water systems that serve more than 300 million people are based on rusting , leaky pipes and decades-old plans that— if not corrected and replaced— will have devastating and long-lasting effects on our communities .
The disaster in Flint , which began in 2014 when the city switched its water supply from Detroit ’ s system to the Flint River in a cost-saving measure , is likely brewing in many other communities . It is inconceivable to me that in the most developed nation on the planet , we have exposed families and young children to the poisonous effects of lead . And it is almost criminal to me that water supply officials were unaware that the water pumping through a large American city was endangering the community . That level of negligence is beyond comprehension .

The aging water infrastructure in this country is deeply flawed. Many of the 150,000 public water systems that serve more than 300 million people are based on rusting, leaky pipes and decades-old plans that— if not corrected and replaced— will have devastating and long-lasting effects on our communities.

The disaster in Flint, which began in 2014 when the city switched its water supply from Detroit’s system to the Flint River in a cost-saving measure, is likely brewing in many other communities. It is inconceivable to me that in the most developed nation on the planet, we have exposed families and young children to the poisonous effects of lead. And it is almost criminal to me that water supply officials were unaware that the water pumping through a large American city was endangering the community. That level of negligence is beyond comprehension.

The dangerous, detrimental effects that lead can have on a developing brain and body are well-documented. In 1978, a largely successful campaign to remove lead from home paint products resulted in a new law, after it was found that small children could mistakenly eat paint chips and be exposed to lead poisoning.

Carol Costello: Why pretend that there's still a debate going on?

Costello: Lack of trust in scientists is one reason the phony controversy continues

There is no debate.

Climate change is real. And, yes, we are, in part, to blame.

There is a 97% consensus among scientific experts that humans are causing global warming. Ninety-seven percent!

Yet some very vocal Americans continue to debate what is surely fact.

The question is, why?

Carol Costello

Trust certainly plays a part.

According to Gordon Gauchat, an associate professor of sociology from the University of Wisconsin, just 42% of adults in the U.S. have a great deal of confidence (PDF) in the scientific community.

It's easy to understand why. Most Americans can't even name a living scientist. I suspect the closest many Americans get to a living, breathing scientist is the fictional Dr. Sheldon Cooper from CBS's sitcom ""The Big Bang Theory."" Sheldon is brilliant, condescending and narcissistic. Whose trust would he inspire?

But trust isn't the only factor in why many Americans doubt climate change.

I asked Anthony Leiserowitz, the director of the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication. His group has been studying the ""why"" question for more than a decade.

""We've found there are six very (specific) categories that respond to this issue in different ways,"" he said.

The first group, ""The Alarmed,"" is made up 16% of the public. They believe climate change is an urgent problem but have no clear idea of how to fix it.

The second group (27%) is ""The Concerned."" They believe climate change is a problem but think it's more about polar bears and tiny islands than a problem that directly affects them.

The fifth group, ""The Doubtful"" (12%), do not think climate change is man-made. They think it's natural and poses no long-term risk.

Leiserowitz says it's the sixth group, ""The Dismissives,"" that is the most problematic, even though it comprises just 15% of the public.

environment,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jul/4/lights-go-dim-on-another-energy-project/,Lights go dim on another energy project ,2012-07-04,Chuck Neubauer,"A geothermal energy company with a $ 98.5 million loan guarantee from the Obama administration for an alternative energy project in Nevada — which received hearty endorsements from Energy Secretary Steven Chu and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid — faces financial problems , and the company ’ s auditors have questioned whether it can stay in business .
Much like Solyndra LLC , a California solar-panel manufacturer with a $ 535 million federal loan guarantee that went bankrupt , Nevada Geothermal Power ( NGP ) has incurred $ 98 million in net losses over the past several years , has substantial debts and does not generate enough cash from its current operations after debt-service costs , an internal audit said .
“ The company ’ s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its available cash and its ability to continue to raise funds to support corporate operations and the development of other properties , ” NGP auditors said in a financial statement for the period ending March 31 .
“ Consequently , material uncertainties exist which cast significant doubt upon the company ’ s ability to continue as a going concern , ” the statement said .
Mr. Reid , a Nevada Democrat who led passage of the $ 814 billion stimulus bill and worked to include the loan guarantee program to help finance clean-energy projects , predicted in 2010 that NGP would “ put Nevadans to work ” and declared that Nevada was the “ Saudi Arabia of geothermal energy . ”
Mr. Chu celebrated NGP ’ s potential in his June 2010 announcement of the loan guarantee , saying the federal government ’ s support of the company demonstrated its commitment to geothermal power to achieve the nation ’ s clean-energy goals .
But Rep. Jim Jordan , Ohio Republican and chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee on regulatory affairs , stimulus oversight and government spending , is concerned about NGP ’ s finances and the timing of the loan guarantee .
“ The company was in danger of defaulting on its financial obligation , and the [ Department of Energy ‘ s ] assistance served as a de facto bailout , ” Mr. Jordan said . “ After receiving a taxpayer-backed $ 98.5 million loan guarantee , the company is still struggling . ”
He said the loan guarantee “ essentially served to prop up an already-faltering firm . ”
In January , Rep. Darrell E. Issa , California Republican and chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , told Mr. Chu that the NGP loan guarantee raised questions about why the Energy Department was investing significant taxpayer resources in a company with well-established financial problems .
At the time the Energy Department announced its conditional approval of the guarantee , Mr. Issa said NGP would have defaulted on a loan from TCW Asset Management Co. , then its primary lender , “ had DOE not swooped in to save the failing company with taxpayer money . ”
A committee report said the loan did not finance any new construction and “ did not help to create a single job . ”
During a House hearing in May , Rep. Frank C. Guinta , New Hampshire Republican , asked why NGP needed a government loan in 2010 just a year after it had received financing to get its plant up and running . He said it didn ’ t sound like a loan but a bailout .
“ I don ’ t see it ’ s a good practice for the Department of Energy to use taxpayer-subsidized loans to provide to an entity that already has an existing facility , ” he said .
Mr. Jordan said the Energy Department handed out more than 20 loan guarantees to companies with an average credit rating of BB- , or “ junk status , ” meaning they were vulnerable to default if economic or business conditions changed . NPG was rated BB+ , which is considered speculative or junk and a step below investment grade .
Mr. Jordan and Mr. Issa have questioned why taxpayer money was “ put at such risk . ”
Brian D. Fairbank , president and CEO of NGP , defended the company by saying its auditors were required to list all risks the firm faced because its stock is traded publicly . But , he said , NGP is making its payments on its federally backed loan .
“ The loan is in good shape . The loan is fully supported , ” he said , noting that the federally guaranteed loan went to an NGP subsidiary known as NGP Blue Mountain 1 , for which he also serves as president and CEO .
The Energy Department guaranteed nearly $ 79 million , or 80 percent of the $ 98.5 million loan , financed in 2010 by John Hancock Financial Services . The loan is secured by assets from Blue Mountain 1 and gets paid from revenues generated by a 20-year power purchase agreement with NV Energy ( formerly Nevada Power Co. ) .
“ There is no question we benefited from the loan guarantee , ” said Mr. Fairbank , adding that it helped them get the Hancock loan 4.14 percent compared with the 14 percent interest rate the company was paying on its existing debt with another lender .
Mr. Fairbank acknowledged that NGP is not current on a separate high-interest $ 88.4 million loan from a Washington investment firm , which is not backed by the federal government and is subordinate to the federal guaranteed loan — meaning John Hancock and the Energy Department have first claim on Blue Mountain ’ s assets and earnings in a default .
John McIlveen , a stock analyst at Toronto-based Jacob Securities Inc. who monitors NPG , said he did not think the federally guaranteed loan was in trouble because it “ holds all the cards. ” But he said he did not see the subordinate lender “ getting out whole . ”
He said Blue Mountain 1 is not producing as much energy as the company had hoped and needs $ 20 million to help increase its capacity , which could be difficult to raise .
Energy Department spokesman Dan Leistikow defended the loan guarantee by saying NGP was continuing to make its loan payments “ on time and in full . ”
Mr. Reid ’ s spokeswoman Kristen Orthman said NGP has received bipartisan support because “ programs and incentives for clean energy have helped create jobs and make Nevada a growing leader in geothermal energy production . ”
Mr. Fairbank denied knowing or lobbying Mr. Reid , but the House Oversight Committee said Ormat Inc. , which was paid $ 80 million to build NGP ’ s Blue Mountain plant , has “ strong ties ” to the senator . It said two former Reid staffers , Kai Anderson and Paul Thomsen , work for Ormat .
NGP said it will hold its annual shareholders meeting July 24 in Vancouver , British Columbia , during which Mr. Fairbank is expected to discuss the firm ’ s debts , a recapitalization plan and steps that have been taken to reduce operating costs , including ending its registration and over-the-counter listings in the United States to eliminate the costs of Securities and Exchange Commission reporting requirements .

Show Hide Donald Trump is pulling the US out of the Paris climate accord - meanwhile sweltering US cities are facing ever greater challenges on coping with heat and the climate crisis . It ’ s been the hottest July on record and many US cities have endured heatwaves - including those as far north as Alaska , where thermometers hit 90F ( 32C ) for the first time .

“ This is the hottest I ’ ve ever seen in July , ” said King at the center , which is just a few miles from the White House rose garden where President Trump said in 2017 that the US will leave the Paris climate change accord .
Residents of the US capital are regularly baked in heatwaves and endure stiflingly thick humidit .
But much like many cities around the world , Washington DC is being slowly cooked by the human-driven climate crisis to the extent its entire character will be transformed .
By 2080 , researchers recently found , Washington DC ’ s climate will resemble what northern Mississippi or Dallas is like currently .
Unless drastic action is taken to slash greenhouse gases , global heating will transform the climates of almost every community in the US by the time today ’ s children are entering retirement . Outdoors in Philadelphia will feel more like Memphis ; New York City is set to morph into northeastern Arkansas ; Houston and Miami have no US comparison , leaping instead deep into climates currently found in Mexico .
“ Every city gets warmer , none get cooler , ” said Matt Fitzpatrick , a University of Maryland academic who formulated the climate projections for US cities , based on a range of heat and rainfall scenarios .
In the lifetime of children today , a lot of these cities are going to be dramatically transformed Matt Fitzpatrick , University of Maryland
Its research shows how 540 North American urban areas will by 2080 become , on average , “ most like the contemporary climate of locations about 500 miles ( 805kms ) away and mainly to the south . ”
The average temperature in US cities will rise by a blistering 9F ( 5C ) by the end of the century , compared to the period of 1960-1990 , if greenhouse gas emissions aren ’ t curbed . Some cities will be outliers – Fairbanks , Alaska , for example , is in danger of heating up by a sweltering 11.8F ( 6.6C ) .
“ Cities have built infrastructure for a climate that will no longer be there , ” Fitzpatrick said . “ They will have to live with more heat and , if they are on the coast , flooding too . In the lifetime of children today , a lot of these places are going to be dramatically transformed . ”
This new reality of searing heat is an existential one for those most vulnerable – the sick , the elderly and , in particular , the homeless . Washington officials estimate 6,521 people were experiencing homelessness this year , down 6 % from 2018 . In the broader metropolitan area , about 9,794 people are without homes .
Laura Zeilinger , director of the Department of Human Services , said as the city heats up , her goal stays the same – to get people into homes . Zeilinger said she isn ’ t aware of any heat-related deaths in the city , although she does review any hypothermia-related deaths at the end of each winter .
“ It ’ s when people don ’ t have housing that the elements become life threatening , ” Zeilinger said .
It doesn ’ t take much of a temperature increase to permanently shift the expected climate of a city . Fitzpatrick found that a 9.8F ( 5.5C ) average temperature increase during Washington DC ’ s winter would plunge it into what the deep south is like today . This scenario , possible if emissions aren ’ t curbed , would also make DC around 70 % wetter .
“ When people hear about a few degrees in temperature rise they can think ‘ that doesn ’ t sound too bad. ’ This shows it can really have a big impact , ” said Fitzpatrick , who has started to ponder the altered state of Cumberland , Maryland – the town he lives in . “ It ’ s going to look more like southern Kentucky , more of a subtropical climate , ” he said . “ We get a fair amount of snow now but that ’ s all going to change . It ’ s going to be very different . ”
Washington DC has been given a recent glimpse into its future – a 92F ( 33C ) burst of heat last May saw the city break a 105-year-old record for high temperatures . Sitting on the banks of two tidal rivers – the Potomac and the Anacostia – Washington DC is also essentially a delta city at growing risk of flooding as bursts of rainfall become more intense .
It won ’ t just be uncomfortable , it will be a life or death challenge for many people Jessica Grannis , Georgetown Climate Center
City leaders have attempted to identify the threat and counter it . A climate resilience plan , released in April , states that DC ’ s temperature has already risen by 2F ( 1.1C ) over the past 50 years , with a further 4.5F ( 2.5C ) increase to come within 30 years .
The number of “ heat emergency days ” in DC , where the heat index tops 95F ( 35C ) , is expected to occur on more than 50 days a year as the century draws to a close . “ That means that , in 2080 , our summer will be one long heat emergency , ” the DC resilience document warns .
This scorching new climate is set to heavily burden DC ’ s growing population , many of them low-income and struggling with housing affordability . Vulnerable people will likely suffer dehydration or heatstroke , with increasing use of air conditioning placing a strain on the electrical grid .
“ It will affect how people live , work and get around in the city , ” said Jessica Grannis , adaptation program manager at the Georgetown Climate Center . “ It won ’ t just be uncomfortable , it will be a life or death challenge for many people . Once it starts getting very hot at night , people without air conditioning are going to be at serious risk if they can ’ t cool down properly . ”
Kevin Bush , DC ’ s chief resilience officer , has pledged to “ make the city ’ s immune system stronger ” to cope with this threat , comparing it to how cities in California prepare for the ructions of an earthquake .
Under the resilience plan , all DC buildings must be retrofitted to cope with rising heat and flooding threats by 2050 , with all new buildings adhering to stricter codes within 13 years . The most at-risk buildings may even be removed .
There ’ s a plan to add more greenery to DC by planting more trees , which will provide shade , and other vegetation that will help soak up stormwater from heavy downpours . The curbsides of several major streets are already getting a makeover , with new plants being bedded in to help cool down the city .
“ If walk along the streets in DC at the moment you ’ ll see a lot of pavements being taken out in favour of plantings , ” Grannis said . DC is , she added , “ one of the most climate prepared cities in the US . Unfortunately it ’ s not quite the same everywhere . ”
Dallas , which has a climate that Washington DC is moving towards , is currently trying to muster its own response to the rising heat . By 2080 , according to the University of Maryland research , Dallas is set to become more like New Orleans – nearly 9F ( 5C ) hotter and nearly three times as wet .
“ We had a storm event a few weeks ago where 350,000 people lost power , trees were knocked over . People started to think we maybe aren ’ t as resilient as we thought , even when it ’ s not a Hurricane Harvey sort of event , ” said James McGuire , director of environmental quality at the City of Dallas .
Dallas ’ situation is exacerbated by the vast sprawl of concrete at its heart . A third of its surface is made up of rooftops , parking lots , highways and other impervious surfaces that soak up heat . This gives Dallas one of the highest “ urban heat island ” effects in the US , with the city up to 15F warmer than nearby rural areas . Some areas of the city average peak temperatures of 101F for five months of the year .
Of all US cities , only Phoenix is heating up quicker than Dallas , found a 2017 report from the Texas Trees Foundation , which recommended the city plant 250,000 trees to alleviate the sweltering conditions .
We are getting diseases like Zika and West Nile that Texans never really used to worry about before James McGuire , City of Dallas
McGuire said the city hasn ’ t decided whether to adopt this goal but admitted Dallas needs “ a lot more trees. ” A recent giveaway of saplings to residents proved popular but more robust action will need to be undertaken without much state or federal support . McGuire said that officials in Dallas talk to their counterparts in Houston and San Antonio about heat but they may have to wait for a time when “ impacts are so severe everyone will have to do something . ”
Dallas ’ s summer is set to double in length by the end of the century if radical climate action isn ’ t taken , according to a major US government assessment released last year . The city will also be prone to the whiplash of prolonged droughts interspersed by the drumbeat of heavier rainfall .

Property on the banks of Trinity river , that runs through Dallas , has long received billions of dollars of flooding protection but there is less preparation for fresher challenges , such as protecting people working outdoors who risk keeling over in the heat .
In January , Dallas City Council kickstarted an attempt to address this manifold problem by passing its first climate resolution . Most of its adaption plans , however , have yet to be formed or funded .
“ It ’ s the worst of all potential worlds , really , ” McGuire said . “ We are getting more asthma problems . We are getting more drought . We are getting diseases like Zika and West Nile that Texans never really used to worry about before . We just hope the most dire projections won ’ t happen . ”

I find the change refreshing . Unsurprisingly , not everyone shares this reaction .
An interesting piece of real-world evidence comes from the example of the Mondragon Corporation in the Basque region of Spain . With eighty-five thousand worker-owners , it ’ s the largest worker cooperative in the world today . The average Spanish CEO makes 143 times the salary of the average Spanish worker . Even in a business environment where Mondragon has to compete with traditional hierarchical businesses that can lure skilled managers away with higher salaries , the maximum pay differential between the highest-paid executive and the lowest-paid worker allowed by Mondragon policy — set by the General Assembly , where all eighty-five thousand workers get a vote — is capped at a paltry six to one .
To see her point , take one of the most often cited indications of wealth inequality — that the average American CEO makes 265 times the salary of the average American worker . ( This is actually one of the more conservative estimates . An analysis released by former Minnesota congressman Keith Ellison puts the differential at a staggering 339 to 1 . ) Where nonsocialist progressives typically think that the proper solution to excessive inequality is redistributive taxation , socialists think the underlying issue is a matter of who gets to set pay scales in the first place .
In making this distinction , Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez was giving voice to an idea with deep roots in socialist thought — that the unequal distribution of wealth is just a symptom of the deeper problem of the unequal distribution of economic power .
In a Martin Luther King Jr Day discussion with Ta-Nehisi Coates , Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez argued for a very different perspective . If Jeff Bezos “ wants to be a good person , ” she said , he should “ turn Amazon into a worker cooperative. ” She argued that our primary message to billionaires shouldn ’ t be that we want to redistribute their money . Instead , it should be that “ we want their power . ”
The combined sum might be a fraction of his net worth , and Bezos might have a history of standing in the way of political efforts to address some of the same problems he seeks to address with his charity . Even so , many would argue that his efforts are still praiseworthy .
On Monday morning , Jeff Bezos announced the creation of a new $ 10 billion environmental foundation , the Bezos Earth Fund . This is on top of the $ 2 billion he already committed to the Bezos Family Foundation to build preschools and fight homelessness .
Michael S. Rozeff argues that since Amazon workers who “ made wage bargains with Amazon and didn ’ t form a cooperative ” were freely choosing the first course over the second one , if Bezos is a bad person for not restructuring Amazon as a worker cooperative , his employees share the blame .
Liz Wolfe at Reason claims in her response to Ocasio-Cortez that a cooperative form of organization “ is unlikely to work for a company of Amazon ’ s size. ” She backs up this point by quoting an older article by John McLaughry that claims life in “ [ a ] n unstructured participatory workplace ” can lead to “ problems of severe emotional intensity. ” He mentions “ rage , tears , splitting headaches , and other real stress afflictions. ” McLaughry concedes that such experiments might work despite these problems in cases where “ everyone involved comes from a common cultural , ethnic , racial , or political background , ” but he says that “ success can be close to impossible ” when this is not the case .
Putting Rozeff , Wolfe , and McLaughry ’ s points together , we get the following objections to converting Amazon into a worker cooperative :
Despite the unviability of cooperatives , if Amazon ’ s workforce preferred a cooperative form , they would have formed a cooperative to compete with Amazon . Even if cooperatives are generally viable , Amazon is too big to function as one . Amazon workers are too diverse to handle democratic decision-making together . The transition to democracy in the workplace would be too stressful and upsetting for Amazon workers to handle .
An obvious problem with the first point is that it ignores considerable barriers to entry . Research on worker cooperatives shows that they ’ re at least as efficient as other firms . Once they get going , they do about as well and last about as long as regular capitalist businesses . The problem isn ’ t a higher death rate — it ’ s a considerably lower birth rate .
There are many reasons for this , but an obvious one is that it ’ s easier to attract investors for a new business if you can offer them ongoing ownership shares . That ’ s why Karl Marx praised worker cooperatives as “ great social experiments ” that provided a valuable proof of concept that it was possible for “ modern industrial production ” to take place without a division between “ a class of masters ” and “ a class of hands , ” but he said that actually transitioning to an economy based on workplace democracy would require political struggle .
The second objection makes sense — if we assume , as Wolfe and McLaughry seem to , that turning Amazon into a worker cooperative would mean “ unstructured ” participatory workplaces — endless mass meetings striving for consensus on every issue . But there ’ s no reason to assume this . Workers ( at individual fulfillment centers and throughout the company ) could elect a management structure in the way that they do at Mondragon .
To be sure , this isn ’ t a panacea . There are serious critiques of the Mondragon model that advocates of worker cooperatives would do well to grapple with — but the question isn ’ t whether working at Amazon would be a workplace utopia blissfully free of worker alienation and other problems if it were converted into a cooperative . The question is whether it would be better .
The best counter to the third objection is the real-world history of the labor movement , which has proven over and over again around the world that workers from diverse ethnic , cultural , and political backgrounds can work together in democratic organizations to decide what they want to be paid , how they want their workplaces to function , and so on . The only difference is that in a unionized workplace , the workers have to negotiate with a boss ( who has more bargaining power ) about how many of these plans come to fruition . In a cooperative workplace , the democratic decision of the workers or their elected representatives is the final say .
As to the fourth objection , it ’ s true that getting to make decisions for yourself can be stressful and upsetting . The question is whether this would be more or less stressful , upsetting , exhausting , and demoralizing than working in the rigidly hierarchical structure Jeff Bezos currently imposes on his workforce .
Rozeff might think that Amazon workers “ chose ” to work at the company rather than going into business for themselves , but the severe inequality in bargaining power between an ultra-wealthy corporation and its atomized “ associates ” means very few of their preferences are reflected in the company ’ s policies . A full 91 percent “ wouldn ’ t recommend working there , ” 89 percent described themselves as “ exploited , ” 71 percent “ reported walking more than 10 miles per day ” during their shifts at fulfillment centers , and 78 percent “ felt their breaks were too short . ”
Former Amazon “ associate ” Candice Dixon reported having to scan a new item once every eleven seconds to meet her quota . “ Amazon always knew ” if she didn ’ t . This nightmare of “ cutting-edge technology , unrelenting surveillance , and constant disciplinary write-ups ” led to Dixon destroying her back .
Today , not only can she not work at the company , she can “ barely climb stairs. ” This experience isn ’ t unusual . The rate of serious injuries at Amazon fulfillment centers is more than twice the national average for the warehousing industry — “ 9.6 injuries per 100 full-time workers in 2018 , compared to an industry average that year of 4 . ”
Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez ’ s proposal to convert Amazon into a cooperative might not solve all the problems of its workers in one fell swoop . Democracy in any sphere can be complicated and messy — and it might indeed be stressful . It would , however , probably be a lot less stressful than working for a company that cares so little about your preferences that , in its constant drive to fill orders a little bit faster , it ’ s willing to literally maim you .","I’ve been a socialist for long enough that I can remember a time when hearing one of the highest-profile congresswomen in the country advocate the transformation of big businesses into worker cooperatives would have been unthinkable. I find the change refreshing. Unsurprisingly, not everyone shares this reaction.

An interesting piece of real-world evidence comes from the example of the Mondragon Corporation in the Basque region of Spain. With eighty-five thousand worker-owners, it’s the largest worker cooperative in the world today. The average Spanish CEO makes 143 times the salary of the average Spanish worker. Even in a business environment where Mondragon has to compete with traditional hierarchical businesses that can lure skilled managers away with higher salaries, the maximum pay differential between the highest-paid executive and the lowest-paid worker allowed by Mondragon policy — set by the General Assembly, where all eighty-five thousand workers get a vote — is capped at a paltry six to one.

To see her point, take one of the most often cited indications of wealth inequality — that the average American CEO makes 265 times the salary of the average American worker. (This is actually one of the more conservative estimates. An analysis released by former Minnesota congressman Keith Ellison puts the differential at a staggering 339 to 1.)

The Libertarian Critique

Michael S. Rozeff argues that since Amazon workers who “made wage bargains with Amazon and didn’t form a cooperative” were freely choosing the first course over the second one, if Bezos is a bad person for not restructuring Amazon as a worker cooperative, his employees share the blame.

Liz Wolfe at Reason claims in her response to Ocasio-Cortez that a cooperative form of organization “is unlikely to work for a company of Amazon’s size.” She backs up this point by quoting an older article by John McLaughry that claims life in “[a]n unstructured participatory workplace” can lead to “problems of severe emotional intensity.” He mentions “rage, tears, splitting headaches, and other real stress afflictions.” McLaughry concedes that such experiments might work despite these problems in cases where “everyone involved comes from a common cultural, ethnic, racial, or political background,” but he says that “success can be close to impossible” when this is not the case.

Putting Rozeff, Wolfe, and McLaughry’s points together, we get the following objections to converting Amazon into a worker cooperative:

Despite the unviability of cooperatives, if Amazon’s workforce preferred a cooperative form, they would have formed a cooperative to compete with Amazon. Even if cooperatives are generally viable, Amazon is too big to function as one. Amazon workers are too diverse to handle democratic decision-making together. The transition to democracy in the workplace would be too stressful and upsetting for Amazon workers to handle.

An obvious problem with the first point is that it ignores considerable barriers to entry. Research on worker cooperatives shows that they’re at least as efficient as other firms. Once they get going, they do about as well and last about as long as regular capitalist businesses. The problem isn’t a higher death rate — it’s a considerably lower birth rate.

The second objection makes sense — if we assume, as Wolfe and McLaughry seem to, that turning Amazon into a worker cooperative would mean “unstructured” participatory workplaces — endless mass meetings striving for consensus on every issue. But there’s no reason to assume this. Workers (at individual fulfillment centers and throughout the company) could elect a management structure in the way that they do at Mondragon.

To be sure, this isn’t a panacea. There are serious critiques of the Mondragon model that advocates of worker cooperatives would do well to grapple with — but the question isn’t whether working at Amazon would be a workplace utopia blissfully free of worker alienation and other problems if it were converted into a cooperative.

Here’s what you need to know about the speech and Obama’s climate plan:

( WATCH: Obama's full speech on climate change)

1. Obama dropped a Keystone bombshell

Despite expectations that the president would steer clear of mentioning Keystone — and the fact that the White House plan never mentions the project — Obama announced that he would support building the pipeline only if it won’t “significantly” increase greenhouse gas emissions.

Obama didn’t say if he thinks Keystone can meet that standard, although a draft State Department study issued in March called the project’s environmental impact negligible.

“Our national interest will be served only if this project does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution,” Obama said. “The net effects of the pipeline’s impact on our climate will be absolutely critical to determining whether this project is allowed to go forward.”

In its draft study in March, the State Department downplayed worries that Keystone would inspire a huge, carbon-spewing increase in oil production from Canada’s tar sands region — arguing that Canadians will tap that supply “with or without the proposed project,” and that the crude could be exported by rail. Greens disagree, saying the pipeline is critical to whether Canada has any incentive to ramp up production.

Both supporters and opponents of the pipeline issued statements during the speech calling Obama’s words favorable for their side.

2. The president went to bat for McCarthy

Obama reserved special praise for Gina McCarthy, his nominee to head the Environmental Protection Agency. McCarthy’s nomination was already being held up by Senate Republicans’ complaints that the agency is secretive, and Obama’s climate push has prompted some top GOP lawmakers to warn that she faces even more trouble.

“The Senate should confirm her without any further obstruction or delay,” Obama said, noting that McCarthy, who currently heads the EPA’s air office, has worked for past Republican governors.

And he took a few shots at Republicans who question climate science.

“We don’t have time for a meeting of the Flat Earth Society,” Obama said. “Sticking your head in the sand might make you feel safer, but it’s not going to protect you from the coming storm.”

3. Obama is done waiting for Congress

Obama tried to get a cap-and-trade bill through Congress during his first term, and in this year’s State of the Union address he gave lawmakers one final ultimatum.

“If Congress won’t act soon to protect future generations, I will,” he said in the February speech. “I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy.”

But even at the time, the universal expectation was that Congress had zero chance of passing any serious climate legislation. His rollout Tuesday acknowledged that reality.

Now, the president is directing agencies from the Department of Agriculture to the EPA to take action — with the main onus falling on the EPA.

4. The plan won’t target all parts of the economy

The days when it seemed possible to impose an economywide cap on greenhouse gas emissions are long gone. Instead, the president is taking a piecemeal approach that focuses on one sector of the economy at a time.

In his first term, he tackled transportation, which accounts for about 30 percent of the country’s greenhouse gas output, by imposing tough standards to reduce vehicles’ emissions and increase fuel economy.",www.politico.com,left,NJyOIsWcXj2EVrwi

''
That began to change Monday when President Barack Obama 's administration announced its boldest step yet to reduce the nation 's biggest source of pollution blamed for global warming -- carbon emission from power plants .
A proposed new Environmental Protection Agency rule would reduce such emissions 30 % by 2030 , compared to the levels in 2005 .
The move announced by EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy was intended to show the world that the United States would walk the climate change talk , and establish Obama 's environmental legacy as he enters the final third of his presidency .
`` For the sake of our families ' health and our kids ' future , we have a moral obligation to act on climate , '' McCarthy said . `` When we do , we 'll turn risks on climate into business opportunity . We 'll spur innovation and investment , and we 'll build a world-leading clean energy economy . ''
Obama later made a similar case in a conference call with the American Lung Association , noting that power plant pollution contributes to asthma and other diseases suffered by American kids , especially black and Latino youngsters .
`` This is something that is important for all of us , '' he said , urging support for efforts to work together to help protect `` this beautiful blue ball in the middle of space there we 're a part of . ''
The announcement , expected for months , prompted immediate protests from the energy industry , Republicans and some Democrats from coal and oil states who complained the proposed EPA rules would harm the economy and raise energy prices .
`` All the major legislative and regulatory proposals to combat global warming kill jobs and disproportionately hurt lower income people and minorities , '' the conservative National Center for Public Policy Research argued in a list of `` top 10 reasons Washington should not impose new global warming laws or regulations . ''
Nonsense , Obama shot back , noting how similar warnings always greeted major environmental progress in the past , but eventually proved untrue .
`` What we 've seen every time is that these claims are debunked when you actually give workers and business the tools and incentive they need to innovate , '' he said , citing previous government moves against air pollution and acid rain .
Carbon pollution that increased dramatically since the industrial revolution of the 19th century corresponds to the warming of the global climate , and scientists predict rising oceans , volatile weather patterns , changing agriculture zones and other impacts in coming decades that will affect everyone on the planet and require an increasing percentage of national budgets to prevent catastrophic results .
A multimillion-dollar campaign backed by the energy industry has sought to debunk the science of climate change , but polls show most Americans believe the planet is warming .
Almost a third of America 's carbon emissions comes from electricity generation , and the proposed EPA rules announced Monday would give states a variety of options to meet the goal of an overall 30 % reduction in such pollution by 2030 .
Some of the ideas already being used include improving energy efficiency at plants , changing how long they operate each day and increasing alternative energy sources such as wind and solar production .
EPA officials concede some of the dirtiest power plants now operating , such as older coal-fired plants , will end up shuttered as the nation shifts its reliance from traditional fossil fuel sources to cleaner alternatives .
Coal supplied 37 % of U.S. electricity in 2012 , compared to 30 % from natural gas , 19 % from nuclear power plants , 7 % from hydropower sources such as dams and 5 % from renewable sources such as wind and solar , according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration .
By 2030 , just over 30 % of U.S. electricity will come from coal and about the same amount from natural gas , with wind , solar and other alternative sources providing about 9 % , according to the EPA officials who spoke to reporters on Monday on the condition of not being identified .
According to the EPA , the proposed new rules would reduce carbon pollution by the same amount as removing two-thirds of all cars and trucks form American roads .
It put the cost as high as $ 8.8 billion a year , but noted health gains such as fewer premature deaths and respiratory diseases along with other benefits would be worth tens of billions of dollars to the U.S. economy .
While critics contend the EPA rules will mean higher electricity costs , Obama and members of his administration argued the transformation to a more energy efficient power sector would bring lower electricity bills in the future .
For Obama , another key motivation is to give the United States standing to pressure emerging economies in China , India and other countries to also adopt cleaner energy policies .
Until now , U.S. calls for all players to participate in global climate change agreement went unheeded because developing countries argued America and other industrialized powers got rich while polluting , and now they should have the same chance to develop .
At home , enemies of climate change legislation complained any U.S. steps would be meaningless , putting America at a disadvantage for policies that would do little on their own to reduce overall global emissions .
White House spokesman Jay Carney told CNN on Monday that in order to get the kind of global buy-in necessary to achieve the kind of overall cuts in carbon emissions required to make a difference , the United States `` has to lead , first of all , and this is an indication that the United States will lead on this very important challenge posed by climate change and global warming . ''
The EPA will hold a public comment period and then revise the proposal over the next year . Under the proposed rule , states would have until June 30 , 2016 , to submit plans for achieving the reduced emissions target .
States that need more time can submit an initial version by that date and explain the need for more time , with a final version due one or two years later , `` as appropriate , '' the proposed rule says .
According to the EPA , the regulation will `` reduce pollutants that contribute to the soot and smog that make people sick by over 25 percent . '' The agency projects the reductions will avoid 2,700 to 6,600 premature deaths and 140,000 to 150,000 asthma attacks in children .
`` This is something we ca n't put off , and the President deserves huge credit for making this his legacy , '' said David Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council .
`` The administration has set out to kill coal and its 800,000 jobs , '' Sen. Mike Enzi said in the GOP weekly address Saturday . The Chamber of Commerce , a business federation , estimated the new regulations will cost the economy $ 50 billion a year .
Obama 's move could affect competitive Senate races in coal industry states such as Kentucky , North Carolina and Colorado at a time when Democrats are trying to keep control of the upper chamber .
`` By imposing these draconian new rules on the nation 's coal industry , President Obama and every other liberal lawmaker in Washington who quietly supports them is also picking regional favorites , helping their political supporters in states like California and New York while inflicting acute pain on states like Kentucky , '' said Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell , who is facing a re-election battle in November in the Bluegrass State . `` The impact on individuals and families and entire regions of the country will be catastrophic , as a proud domestic industry is decimated — and many of its jobs shipped overseas . ''
Some Democrats from fossil fuel states who face tough re-election battles , such as Sens . Mary Landrieu in Louisiana and Mark Pryor in Arkansas , expressed concern Monday with the proposed EPA rule but stopped short of condemning outright the need to address rising carbon emissions .
Democratic Sen. Jean Shaheen of New Hampshire , who also has a tough re-election challenge from former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown , took her own regional approach to the matter , saying the EPA rule was needed to balance regulation of power plants .
`` For too long , the Midwest has been allowed to lag behind New Hampshire and other New England states in addressing carbon pollution , '' she said , referring to acid rain regulations that affected her region . `` The draft EPA rules will get Midwest power plants to do what power plants in New England have already done and will decrease the air pollution that moves from the Midwest to our states . ''
Shaheen added that `` we are already seeing the impact of climate change in New Hampshire , threatening many of our traditional industries and the health of our children , '' saying she would `` carefully review the proposed EPA rules to ensure they protect New Hampshire , but the time for national action is long overdue . ''","(CNN) For decades, U.S. climate change policy amounted to a hypocrisy associated with bad parenting: ""Do as I say, not as I do.""

That began to change Monday when President Barack Obama's administration announced its boldest step yet to reduce the nation's biggest source of pollution blamed for global warming -- carbon emission from power plants.

A proposed new Environmental Protection Agency rule would reduce such emissions 30% by 2030, compared to the levels in 2005.

The move announced by EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy was intended to show the world that the United States would walk the climate change talk, and establish Obama's environmental legacy as he enters the final third of his presidency.

""For the sake of our families' health and our kids' future, we have a moral obligation to act on climate,"" McCarthy said. ""When we do, we'll turn risks on climate into business opportunity. We'll spur innovation and investment, and we'll build a world-leading clean energy economy.""

Obama later made a similar case in a conference call with the American Lung Association, noting that power plant pollution contributes to asthma and other diseases suffered by American kids, especially black and Latino youngsters.

""This beautiful blue ball in space""

""This is something that is important for all of us,"" he said, urging support for efforts to work together to help protect ""this beautiful blue ball in the middle of space there we're a part of.""

The announcement, expected for months, prompted immediate protests from the energy industry, Republicans and some Democrats from coal and oil states who complained the proposed EPA rules would harm the economy and raise energy prices.

""All the major legislative and regulatory proposals to combat global warming kill jobs and disproportionately hurt lower income people and minorities,"" the conservative National Center for Public Policy Research argued in a list of ""top 10 reasons Washington should not impose new global warming laws or regulations.""

Nonsense, Obama shot back, noting how similar warnings always greeted major environmental progress in the past, but eventually proved untrue.

""What we've seen every time is that these claims are debunked when you actually give workers and business the tools and incentive they need to innovate,"" he said, citing previous government moves against air pollution and acid rain.

Carbon pollution that increased dramatically since the industrial revolution of the 19th century corresponds to the warming of the global climate, and scientists predict rising oceans, volatile weather patterns, changing agriculture zones and other impacts in coming decades that will affect everyone on the planet and require an increasing percentage of national budgets to prevent catastrophic results.

Energy industry campaign

A multimillion-dollar campaign backed by the energy industry has sought to debunk the science of climate change, but polls show most Americans believe the planet is warming.

Almost a third of America's carbon emissions comes from electricity generation, and the proposed EPA rules announced Monday would give states a variety of options to meet the goal of an overall 30% reduction in such pollution by 2030.

Some of the ideas already being used include improving energy efficiency at plants, changing how long they operate each day and increasing alternative energy sources such as wind and solar production.

EPA officials concede some of the dirtiest power plants now operating, such as older coal-fired plants, will end up shuttered as the nation shifts its reliance from traditional fossil fuel sources to cleaner alternatives.

Coal supplied 37% of U.S. electricity in 2012, compared to 30% from natural gas, 19% from nuclear power plants, 7% from hydropower sources such as dams and 5% from renewable sources such as wind and solar, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

By 2030, just over 30% of U.S. electricity will come from coal and about the same amount from natural gas, with wind, solar and other alternative sources providing about 9%, according to the EPA officials who spoke to reporters on Monday on the condition of not being identified.

According to the EPA, the proposed new rules would reduce carbon pollution by the same amount as removing two-thirds of all cars and trucks form American roads.

It put the cost as high as $8.8 billion a year, but noted health gains such as fewer premature deaths and respiratory diseases along with other benefits would be worth tens of billions of dollars to the U.S. economy.

Higher costs or more opportunity?

While critics contend the EPA rules will mean higher electricity costs, Obama and members of his administration argued the transformation to a more energy efficient power sector would bring lower electricity bills in the future.

For Obama, another key motivation is to give the United States standing to pressure emerging economies in China, India and other countries to also adopt cleaner energy policies.

Until now, U.S. calls for all players to participate in global climate change agreement went unheeded because developing countries argued America and other industrialized powers got rich while polluting, and now they should have the same chance to develop.

States that need more time can submit an initial version by that date and explain the need for more time, with a final version due one or two years later, ""as appropriate,"" the proposed rule says.

""This is something we put off""

According to the EPA , the regulation will ""reduce pollutants that contribute to the soot and smog that make people sick by over 25 percent."" The agency projects the reductions will avoid 2,700 to 6,600 premature deaths and 140,000 to 150,000 asthma attacks in children.

""This is something we can't put off, and the President deserves huge credit for making this his legacy,"" said David Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Opponents were equally effusive in their condemnation.

""The administration has set out to kill coal and its 800,000 jobs,"" Sen. Mike Enzi said in the GOP weekly address Saturday. The Chamber of Commerce, a business federation, estimated the new regulations will cost the economy $50 billion a year.

Obama's move could affect competitive Senate races in coal industry states such as Kentucky, North Carolina and Colorado at a time when Democrats are trying to keep control of the upper chamber.

Some Democrats doubting

Some Democrats from fossil fuel states who face tough re-election battles, such as Sens. Mary Landrieu in Louisiana and Mark Pryor in Arkansas, expressed concern Monday with the proposed EPA rule but stopped short of condemning outright the need to address rising carbon emissions.

Democratic Sen. Jean Shaheen of New Hampshire, who also has a tough re-election challenge from former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, took her own regional approach to the matter, saying the EPA rule was needed to balance regulation of power plants.

environment,Christian Science Monitor,1,http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2015/0809/Climate-change-crusade-goes-local,Climate change crusade goes local,2015-08-09,Doug Struck,"Florida ’ s state leaders are running hard from climate change . The governor , Rick Scott , doesn ’ t want state employees to even utter the words . Former Gov . Jeb Bush and US Sen. Marco Rubio , both Republican presidential aspirants , offer a medley of objections to scientists ’ calls for bold action on climate change .
Eric Carpenter shrugs . The director of Miami Beach ’ s Public Works Department sits at his desk , poring over tables of high tides on his computer . He is calculating how many pumps he needs to buy to keep the city ’ s streets from being flooded from a rising sea caused by climate change .
Under a broiling sun , he takes a visitor a few blocks from his office , to where contractors are pouring concrete to replace a section of a city street . The new roadway is being laid incongruously 2-1/2 feet above the sidewalk cafe tables and storefront entrances at the old street level . The extra height is in preparation for the seas and tides that Mr. Carpenter already sees engulfing this section of Miami Beach .
“ The facts are the facts , and we have to deal with them , ” he says .
In city after city in South Florida , local officials are dealing with climate change . So , too , are municipalities big and small across the United States . The same determination is evident among governors and legislators in more than two dozen states . And it is magnified worldwide : Surprising progress in grappling with global warming is coming from surprising nations .
This groundswell of action on climate change is producing solutions and often bypassing lagging political leadership . The gathering force of these acts , significant and subtle , is transforming what once seemed a hopeless situation into one in which success can at least be imagined . The initiatives are not enough to halt the world ’ s plunge toward more global warming – yet . But they do point toward a turning point in greenhouse gas emissions , and ambitious – if still uneven – efforts to adapt to the changes already in motion .
“ The troops on the ground , the local officials and stakeholders , are acting , even in the face of a total lack of support on the top level , ” says Michael Mann , a prominent climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University in State College , Pa. “ The impacts of climate change are pretty bad and projected to get much worse if we continue business as usual . But there still is time to avert what we might reasonably describe as a true catastrophe . There are some signs we are starting to turn the corner . ”
Philip Levine , the mayor of Miami Beach , agrees . “ We may not have all the answers , ” he says . “ But we ’ re going to show that Miami Beach is not going to sit back and go underwater . ”
Representatives from more than 190 countries will gather in Paris in December to try to agree on international strategies for dealing with climate change . They will be spurred by their own alarm at a succession of storms , droughts , and heat waves affecting millions of people on the planet , and by outside calls , such as the moral edict from Pope Francis , to care more about the world .
The record of past such meetings is not encouraging . But the representatives will arrive as progress on curbing greenhouse gas emissions , often overlooked , has been mounting :
•Wind and solar power generation are bounding ahead faster than the most optimistic predictions , with a fivefold increase worldwide since 2004 . More than 1 in 5 buildings in countries such as Denmark , Germany , Sweden , and even Albania are now powered by renewable energy .
•The US saw its greenhouse gas emissions peak in 2007 . They have fallen about 10 percent since , and are roughly on course to meet President Obama ’ s pledge to reduce emissions in the next 10 years by about 27 percent from their peak .
•China , the world ’ s largest carbon emitter , paradoxically leads the world in installed wind and solar power , and is charging ahead on renewables . China and the US ended their impasse over who is most responsible to fix global warming , agreeing in November to mutually ambitious goals . Experts say China already has cut coal consumption by 8 percent this year , and the environmental group Greenpeace says China stopped construction of some new coal power plants .
•Worldwide , carbon dioxide emissions , a principal component of greenhouse gases , did not grow in 2014 , according to the International Energy Agency . Emissions remained flat even as the global economy grew – an important milestone .
•Coal-fired power plants are being replaced rapidly by natural gas plants , which are cleaner and emit half the greenhouse gases . Britain saw an 8 percent drop in greenhouse gas emissions last year , which is attributed to national energy policies , more energy efficiency , and the switch from coal .
•Tropical rainforests , which absorb carbon dioxide , are being cut down at a slower rate than in the past – 13 million hectares per year , compared with 16 million in the 1990s , according to the latest figures from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization . That is still alarmingly high but shows progress , in part because of vows by big corporations not to buy palm oil grown on deforested lands . Brazil has made notable progress in reducing deforestation of the Amazon .
In the US , state and local governments are taking bold action even as the national discussion about the looming climate crisis remains paralyzed along political lines . In South Florida , for example , officials of four populous counties shun the rhetoric from GOP presidential aspirants and officials in the state capital and gather regularly to plot cooperative climate change strategy .
That group , the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact , is considered a national model for the kind of shoulder-to-shoulder effort needed to address the problem . They came up with an agreed estimate of sea level rise and identified the most vulnerable areas of the region , and now are plowing through more than 100 recommendations for action .
“ There are no new funding sources coming down from the state or the Feds , ” says Susanne Torriente , assistant city manager for Fort Lauderdale , one of the participants of the compact . “ Would it be good to have state and federal dollars ? Yes . Are we going to wait until they act ? No . ”
Their cooperation was born , essentially , on the back of a napkin . Kristin Jacobs , now a state representative who was a Broward County commissioner in 2008 , was lamenting at the time that the 27 disparate municipal water authorities in the region could not agree on joint action . So she and others came up with the idea of getting local officials together in a classroom .
“ We said , ‘ Let ’ s have an academy , ’ ” she recalls , and the Broward Leaders Water Academy began offering elected officials in South Florida six-month courses in water hydraulics and policy . It has now graduated “ three generations of elected officials , ” she says .
Figuring out what to do about climate change – whether it is building up dunes on the beaches , raising the height of foundations , or shifting developments back from the coastline – takes a cooperative approach . “ We couldn ’ t do it by just saying ‘ this is the way it is ’ – the Moses approach , ” Ms. Jacobs says . “ We had to do it with compliance and acquiescence and leadership . ”
Normally , direction on some of these issues might have come from state officials . But not in Florida . Not on climate change .
“ We didn ’ t have to worry about those who don ’ t believe , ” Jacobs says . “ At the end of the day , when the water is overtopping your sea wall , you don ’ t really care that you didn ’ t believe in climate change last week . You do believe in it this week . ”
Built on the edge of the sea , Miami Beach is one of the most vulnerable cities in the world to the vicissitudes of the ocean . Its boutique commercial district and canyons of pastel apartments sit on a sieve of porous limestone . The leaky footing was formed over the eons from accumulated seashells , coral , and fish skeletons .
Today the rock acts as a giant wick , giving the relentless ocean a route for subterranean attack . Seawater pushes in from underground and often gurgles to the surface in inconvenient places . On days of really high tides – even without any rain – the briny invasion turns some city streets into small lakes , snarling traffic and cutting off businesses . Locals call it “ sunny day flooding . ”
The man charged with stopping the sea – or at least getting tourists and residents out of its way – is Carpenter , an affable engineer with a burly physique . Carpenter took over the city ’ s Public Works Department two years ago . His recurring nightmare is of rising seas , frequent storms , and “ king ” tides sweeping through Miami Beach – and doing it in full view of the world . He knows that whatever the city does – or does not do – to prepare for climate change will be tested soon on a stage before a global audience .
“ What we do here is magnified because of who we are , ” he says . Miami Beach thrives on a global reputation for glamour , for cultural fusion , for beaches , for heat – from the sun in the day and its epicurean club culture at night . That ’ s not an image that sits well with flooded streets . But the water is already coming .
As the Atlantic Ocean warms and expands , fed by melting polar ice caps , the seawater is pushing back into the 330 storm-water pipe outlets designed to drain rain from city streets . So Miami Beach is in the process of installing as many as 80 pumps , at a cost of nearly $ 400 million , to make sure the water flows outward .
“ If the seas are continuing to rise , and the tidal events are higher than the inland elevation , we have to pump , ” says Carpenter .
The city plans to raise the level of 30 percent of its streets , encouraging businesses to abandon or remodel their first floors to go to a higher level . Carpenter says he wanted to go up nearly six feet , but town officials said “ we are going too fast. ” So they settled on just over three feet .
“ I don ’ t think this is where we want to be long-term , but it ’ s enough to get us through the next 10 or 20 years , ” he says , while standing on a new section of road at Sunset Harbor , looking down at the cafe tables on the sidewalk below , where the street used to be .
Mayor Levine echoes the importance of dealing with the future encroachment of the sea – now . “ We did not ask for climate change or sea level rise , ” he says . “ But we are the tip of the spear . We don ’ t debate the reason why ; we just come up with solutions . ”
Forty miles to the north , past Fort Lauderdale , Randy Brown and his utilities staff in Pompano Beach are also trying to halt the sea . Like the rest of South Florida , the coastal city of 100,000 residents is confronting the ocean above and below ground .
They are burying a new network of water pipes – painted grape purple – running to businesses and homes . The pipes contain sewer water that has been treated to remove the smell and bacteria and then siphoned from a pipe that used to discharge it into the sea .
Pompano Beach residents use the water for their lawns and gardens , bypassing the restrictive bans on lawn sprinkling . This recycled water then trickles down into the Biscayne Aquifer .
Cleansed as it sifts through the ground , it helps reduce the shrinking of the freshwater aquifer , which is being drawn down by the town ’ s 26 wells and is threatened by underground salt water pushed inland by the rising sea level . Homeowners pay about two-thirds less for the recycled water than they do for potable water .
When city officials first laid out the program at a public meeting , bringing a cake to set a neighborly tone , “ it was a fiasco . [ Residents ] called it dangerous , ” chuckles Maria Loucraft , a utilities manager .
Now , people “ say they can ’ t wait for it to get to their area , ” adds Isabella Slagle , who goes to public events with a mascot , a purple-colored sprinkler head with sunglasses , named “ Squirt ” by elementary school students .
Green lawns trump the political arguments over climate change , says Mr. Brown . “ We don ’ t say ‘ climate change , ’ ” he admits . “ It ’ s ‘ protecting resources ’ or ‘ sustainability. ’ That way , you can duck under the political radar . ”
Some don ’ t want to avoid the radar . Last October , the South Miami City Commission voted to create “ South Florida ” and secede from the rest of the state , in part because , they said , the state government in Tallahassee was not responding to their pleas to help them deal with climate change .
“ It got a lot of press but nobody in the state took it very seriously , ” muses the mayor , Philip Stoddard , over a sandwich on the campus of Florida International University , where he is a biology professor . “ But it did get people talking about climate change . ”
“ My house is at 10 feet elevation , ” he adds . “ My wife and I – our question is – will we be able to live out our lives in our house ? I ’ m 58 . We don ’ t know . It ’ s going to be a close one . If you look at the official sea level projections , they keep going up , which is a little disquieting . If you look at the unofficial projections , they scare the hell out of you . ”
While South Florida is a leader at local cooperation , officials in towns and cities across the country are struggling to react to a warming climate . Many municipalities have drafted action plans . Boston is converting its taxis to hybrids and requires new buildings to be built with higher foundations . Chicago is planting green gardens on city roofs to reduce the air conditioning needed to cool buildings . Seattle is helping residents install solar panels . Montpelier , Vt. , vows to eliminate all fossil fuel use by 2030 . Houston is laying down “ cool pavements ” made of reflective and porous material , and planting trees for shade .
Governors and state legislators across the country have gotten the message , too . While Congress will not debate the “ Big Fix ” – putting a price or a cap on carbon pollution – some states are already doing it . About 30 percent of Americans live in states that have rules capping carbon dioxide emissions and markets that allow companies to buy and sell carbon credits .
In addition , 28 states have set mandatory quotas for renewable energy from their electric utilities . Seven states have set ambitious targets for overall greenhouse gas reductions – California has promised a reduction of 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 .
“ The best thing Congress can do right now is stay out of the way , ” says Anna Aurilio , director of the Washington office of the nonprofit advocacy group Environment America . Between the state efforts and the executive orders by Mr. Obama , she says , the US is on track to meet the administration ’ s greenhouse gas goals .
“ When we look at programs currently in place or set to be implemented , we can come close to the US commitment ” of a 27 percent decrease in greenhouse gas emissions in 10 years , she says . “ But we know we have to go much , much further . ”
To get near the goal of keeping average global warming at 2 degrees Celsius ( 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit ) or less , climatologists predict that countries must largely abandon the fossil fuels that have driven technological societies since the Industrial Age – achieving an 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .
That is an imposing goal , since billions of dollars are invested in new and existing fossil fuel power plants that can last 30 to 50 years .

Public outcry has helped close coal-burning power plants , which produce the dirtiest energy . Coal plants now provide about one-third of the electricity in the US – down from more than half in 1990 .

Still , the current projections from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on when the world will see a significant decline in global emissions vary widely – from about 2030 to after 2100 – based on guesses of how countries respond . But the dramatic shift to natural gas in the US , and the racehorse expansion of hydraulic fracturing to get it , are demonstrations that if new technologies are profitable , industries can pivot quickly .
“ We can make that turn , ” Mr. Keohane predicts . “ Imagine the day when emissions are falling instead of rising . Imagine when we are winning rather than losing . ”","Florida’s state leaders are running hard from climate change. The governor, Rick Scott, doesn’t want state employees to even utter the words. Former Gov. Jeb Bush and US Sen. Marco Rubio, both Republican presidential aspirants, offer a medley of objections to scientists’ calls for bold action on climate change.

Eric Carpenter shrugs. The director of Miami Beach’s Public Works Department sits at his desk, poring over tables of high tides on his computer. He is calculating how many pumps he needs to buy to keep the city’s streets from being flooded from a rising sea caused by climate change.

Under a broiling sun, he takes a visitor a few blocks from his office, to where contractors are pouring concrete to replace a section of a city street. The new roadway is being laid incongruously 2-1/2 feet above the sidewalk cafe tables and storefront entrances at the old street level. The extra height is in preparation for the seas and tides that Mr. Carpenter already sees engulfing this section of Miami Beach.

“The facts are the facts, and we have to deal with them,” he says.

In city after city in South Florida, local officials are dealing with climate change. So, too, are municipalities big and small across the United States. The same determination is evident among governors and legislators in more than two dozen states. And it is magnified worldwide: Surprising progress in grappling with global warming is coming from surprising nations.

This groundswell of action on climate change is producing solutions and often bypassing lagging political leadership. The gathering force of these acts, significant and subtle, is transforming what once seemed a hopeless situation into one in which success can at least be imagined. The initiatives are not enough to halt the world’s plunge toward more global warming – yet. But they do point toward a turning point in greenhouse gas emissions, and ambitious – if still uneven – efforts to adapt to the changes already in motion.

“The troops on the ground, the local officials and stakeholders, are acting, even in the face of a total lack of support on the top level,” says Michael Mann, a prominent climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University in State College, Pa. “The impacts of climate change are pretty bad and projected to get much worse if we continue business as usual. But there still is time to avert what we might reasonably describe as a true catastrophe. There are some signs we are starting to turn the corner.”

Philip Levine, the mayor of Miami Beach, agrees. “We may not have all the answers,” he says. “But we’re going to show that Miami Beach is not going to sit back and go underwater.”

Representatives from more than 190 countries will gather in Paris in December to try to agree on international strategies for dealing with climate change. They will be spurred by their own alarm at a succession of storms, droughts, and heat waves affecting millions of people on the planet, and by outside calls, such as the moral edict from Pope Francis, to care more about the world.

The record of past such meetings is not encouraging. But the representatives will arrive as progress on curbing greenhouse gas emissions, often overlooked, has been mounting:

•Wind and solar power generation are bounding ahead faster than the most optimistic predictions, with a fivefold increase worldwide since 2004. More than 1 in 5 buildings in countries such as Denmark, Germany, Sweden, and even Albania are now powered by renewable energy.

•The US saw its greenhouse gas emissions peak in 2007. They have fallen about 10 percent since, and are roughly on course to meet President Obama’s pledge to reduce emissions in the next 10 years by about 27 percent from their peak.

•China, the world’s largest carbon emitter, paradoxically leads the world in installed wind and solar power, and is charging ahead on renewables. China and the US ended their impasse over who is most responsible to fix global warming, agreeing in November to mutually ambitious goals. Experts say China already has cut coal consumption by 8 percent this year, and the environmental group Greenpeace says China stopped construction of some new coal power plants.

•Worldwide, carbon dioxide emissions, a principal component of greenhouse gases, did not grow in 2014, according to the International Energy Agency. Emissions remained flat even as the global economy grew – an important milestone.

•Coal-fired power plants are being replaced rapidly by natural gas plants, which are cleaner and emit half the greenhouse gases. Britain saw an 8 percent drop in greenhouse gas emissions last year, which is attributed to national energy policies, more energy efficiency, and the switch from coal.

•Tropical rainforests, which absorb carbon dioxide, are being cut down at a slower rate than in the past – 13 million hectares per year, compared with 16 million in the 1990s, according to the latest figures from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. That is still alarmingly high but shows progress, in part because of vows by big corporations not to buy palm oil grown on deforested lands. Brazil has made notable progress in reducing deforestation of the Amazon.

In the US, state and local governments are taking bold action even as the national discussion about the looming climate crisis remains paralyzed along political lines. In South Florida, for example, officials of four populous counties shun the rhetoric from GOP presidential aspirants and officials in the state capital and gather regularly to plot cooperative climate change strategy.

That group, the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact, is considered a national model for the kind of shoulder-to-shoulder effort needed to address the problem. They came up with an agreed estimate of sea level rise and identified the most vulnerable areas of the region, and now are plowing through more than 100 recommendations for action.

“There are no new funding sources coming down from the state or the Feds,” says Susanne Torriente, assistant city manager for Fort Lauderdale, one of the participants of the compact. “Would it be good to have state and federal dollars? Yes. Are we going to wait until they act? No.”

Their cooperation was born, essentially, on the back of a napkin. Kristin Jacobs, now a state representative who was a Broward County commissioner in 2008, was lamenting at the time that the 27 disparate municipal water authorities in the region could not agree on joint action. So she and others came up with the idea of getting local officials together in a classroom.

“We said, ‘Let’s have an academy,’ ” she recalls, and the Broward Leaders Water Academy began offering elected officials in South Florida six-month courses in water hydraulics and policy. It has now graduated “three generations of elected officials,” she says.

Figuring out what to do about climate change – whether it is building up dunes on the beaches, raising the height of foundations, or shifting developments back from the coastline – takes a cooperative approach. “We couldn’t do it by just saying ‘this is the way it is’ – the Moses approach,” Ms. Jacobs says. “We had to do it with compliance and acquiescence and leadership.”

Normally, direction on some of these issues might have come from state officials. But not in Florida. Not on climate change.

“We didn’t have to worry about those who don’t believe,” Jacobs says. “At the end of the day, when the water is overtopping your sea wall, you don’t really care that you didn’t believe in climate change last week. You do believe in it this week.”

Built on the edge of the sea, Miami Beach is one of the most vulnerable cities in the world to the vicissitudes of the ocean. Its boutique commercial district and canyons of pastel apartments sit on a sieve of porous limestone. The leaky footing was formed over the eons from accumulated seashells, coral, and fish skeletons.

Today the rock acts as a giant wick, giving the relentless ocean a route for subterranean attack. Seawater pushes in from underground and often gurgles to the surface in inconvenient places. On days of really high tides – even without any rain – the briny invasion turns some city streets into small lakes, snarling traffic and cutting off businesses. Locals call it “sunny day flooding.”

The man charged with stopping the sea – or at least getting tourists and residents out of its way – is Carpenter, an affable engineer with a burly physique. Carpenter took over the city’s Public Works Department two years ago. His recurring nightmare is of rising seas, frequent storms, and “king” tides sweeping through Miami Beach – and doing it in full view of the world. He knows that whatever the city does – or does not do – to prepare for climate change will be tested soon on a stage before a global audience.

“What we do here is magnified because of who we are,” he says. Miami Beach thrives on a global reputation for glamour, for cultural fusion, for beaches, for heat – from the sun in the day and its epicurean club culture at night. That’s not an image that sits well with flooded streets. But the water is already coming.

As the Atlantic Ocean warms and expands, fed by melting polar ice caps, the seawater is pushing back into the 330 storm-water pipe outlets designed to drain rain from city streets. So Miami Beach is in the process of installing as many as 80 pumps, at a cost of nearly $400 million, to make sure the water flows outward.

“If the seas are continuing to rise, and the tidal events are higher than the inland elevation, we have to pump,” says Carpenter.

The city plans to raise the level of 30 percent of its streets, encouraging businesses to abandon or remodel their first floors to go to a higher level. Carpenter says he wanted to go up nearly six feet, but town officials said “we are going too fast.” So they settled on just over three feet.

“I don’t think this is where we want to be long-term, but it’s enough to get us through the next 10 or 20 years,” he says, while standing on a new section of road at Sunset Harbor, looking down at the cafe tables on the sidewalk below, where the street used to be.

Mayor Levine echoes the importance of dealing with the future encroachment of the sea – now. “We did not ask for climate change or sea level rise,” he says. “But we are the tip of the spear. We don’t debate the reason why; we just come up with solutions.”

Forty miles to the north, past Fort Lauderdale, Randy Brown and his utilities staff in Pompano Beach are also trying to halt the sea. Like the rest of South Florida, the coastal city of 100,000 residents is confronting the ocean above and below ground.

They are burying a new network of water pipes – painted grape purple – running to businesses and homes. The pipes contain sewer water that has been treated to remove the smell and bacteria and then siphoned from a pipe that used to discharge it into the sea.

Pompano Beach residents use the water for their lawns and gardens, bypassing the restrictive bans on lawn sprinkling. This recycled water then trickles down into the Biscayne Aquifer.

Cleansed as it sifts through the ground, it helps reduce the shrinking of the freshwater aquifer, which is being drawn down by the town’s 26 wells and is threatened by underground salt water pushed inland by the rising sea level. Homeowners pay about two-thirds less for the recycled water than they do for potable water.

When city officials first laid out the program at a public meeting, bringing a cake to set a neighborly tone, “it was a fiasco. [Residents] called it dangerous,” chuckles Maria Loucraft, a utilities manager.

Now, people “say they can’t wait for it to get to their area,” adds Isabella Slagle, who goes to public events with a mascot, a purple-colored sprinkler head with sunglasses, named “Squirt” by elementary school students.

Green lawns trump the political arguments over climate change, says Mr. Brown. “We don’t say ‘climate change,’ ” he admits. “It’s ‘protecting resources’ or ‘sustainability.’ That way, you can duck under the political radar.”

Some don’t want to avoid the radar. Last October, the South Miami City Commission voted to create “South Florida” and secede from the rest of the state, in part because, they said, the state government in Tallahassee was not responding to their pleas to help them deal with climate change.

“It got a lot of press but nobody in the state took it very seriously,” muses the mayor, Philip Stoddard, over a sandwich on the campus of Florida International University, where he is a biology professor. “But it did get people talking about climate change.”

“My house is at 10 feet elevation,” he adds. “My wife and I – our question is – will we be able to live out our lives in our house? I’m 58. We don’t know. It’s going to be a close one. If you look at the official sea level projections, they keep going up, which is a little disquieting. If you look at the unofficial projections, they scare the hell out of you.”

While South Florida is a leader at local cooperation, officials in towns and cities across the country are struggling to react to a warming climate. Many municipalities have drafted action plans. Boston is converting its taxis to hybrids and requires new buildings to be built with higher foundations. Chicago is planting green gardens on city roofs to reduce the air conditioning needed to cool buildings. Seattle is helping residents install solar panels. Montpelier, Vt., vows to eliminate all fossil fuel use by 2030. Houston is laying down “cool pavements” made of reflective and porous material, and planting trees for shade.

Governors and state legislators across the country have gotten the message, too. While Congress will not debate the “Big Fix” – putting a price or a cap on carbon pollution – some states are already doing it. About 30 percent of Americans live in states that have rules capping carbon dioxide emissions and markets that allow companies to buy and sell carbon credits.

In addition, 28 states have set mandatory quotas for renewable energy from their electric utilities. Seven states have set ambitious targets for overall greenhouse gas reductions – California has promised a reduction of 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030.

“The best thing Congress can do right now is stay out of the way,” says Anna Aurilio, director of the Washington office of the nonprofit advocacy group Environment America. Between the state efforts and the executive orders by Mr. Obama, she says, the US is on track to meet the administration’s greenhouse gas goals.

“When we look at programs currently in place or set to be implemented, we can come close to the US commitment” of a 27 percent decrease in greenhouse gas emissions in 10 years, she says. “But we know we have to go much, much further.”

To get near the goal of keeping average global warming at 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) or less, climatologists predict that countries must largely abandon the fossil fuels that have driven technological societies since the Industrial Age – achieving an 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

That is an imposing goal, since billions of dollars are invested in new and existing fossil fuel power plants that can last 30 to 50 years. Even if solar or wind energy is cheaper than coal, oil, and natural gas, the owners of fossil fuel plants will be reluctant to abandon their investments. But the decisions are starting to come from the people, not just governments or corporations.

“When you have enough action taking place at the grass roots, sometimes that’s a more effective means of implementing change on a large scale,” says Penn State’s Mr. Mann.

Little wonder that it can seem hard to sift the answer to a fundamental question : Just how certain is the science , and how much do scientists agree ?
The answer isn ’ t simple in all its details , because climate itself isn ’ t a simple thing . But the answer is also in many ways less complicated than the media rhetoric implies .
Listen to climate scientists themselves , and what emerges is that consensus about the basics of climate science is very strong , while there is much less certainty about specifics such as how fast temperatures or sea levels can be expected to rise .
When it comes to core concepts of climate change on a global scale , the scientific agreement is broad and clear-cut : Climate change is happening . The Earth is getting warmer . Human activity is largely responsible .
“ Our climate system is far simpler than people think , ” says James White , director of the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado in Boulder . He likes to remind people that there are basic laws of physics at play , as immutable as the law of gravity . Global climate depends on how much energy we get from the sun , how much energy is reflected back to space , and the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere .
“ It ’ s not a belief issue , ” says Professor White . Fossil fuels have been pumping more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere , and “ We don ’ t know of any example in which greenhouse gases don ’ t absorb the Earth ’ s radiation and therefore warm the Earth up . ”
That doesn ’ t mean the impacts of human activity are the only factor affecting climate .
Long before humans began burning fuels , Earth has seen ice ages and warm periods that scientists attribute to small shifts in the planet ’ s tilt and modest variations in its orbit around the sun , among other things .
Now , however , climate scientists say a warming trend is occurring even though natural factors don ’ t seem to predict it .
When people talk about the “ 97 percent ” consensus among international scientists , this is the fundamental issue to which they ’ re referring : that human-caused climate change is already occurring .
Where the consensus starts to disappear is when it comes to more specific questions and predictions – how much and how quickly will temperature rise ? How much and how quickly will sea level rise ? What will the local climate effects be for specific regions ? Have we passed a point of no return , or can the changes be halted ? The foundation of science , after all , is skepticism , and climate models can become extraordinarily complicated very quickly .
Another issue is time frame , notes Richard Alley , a geologist at Pennsylvania State University who specializes in climate research . People tend to be interested in predictions a year or a decade out , but right now , any climate predictions for that time scale are clouded by what he calls “ noise : ” natural phenomena that affect climate and are impossible to know in advance . These include El Niño and La Niña , volcanic eruptions , and small changes in the sun ’ s brightness .
“ Looking out some distance , the natural variability is still important , ” says Professor Alley . “ It ’ s in a few decades that our decisions [ around how much carbon dioxide we ’ re adding to the atmosphere ] become really important . ”
For now , here ’ s where some of the consensus – and disagreement – lies on some fundamental issues .
Again , the basic scientific consensus here is pretty clear : Sea level is already measurably rising , the pace is increasing , and it will continue to rise . In the past century , Global Mean Sea Level has risen between 4 and 8 inches , and in the past couple decades , the rate of increase has roughly doubled .
Scientists say this is one of the easiest effects of global warming to predict : As water heats up ( as is happening ) it expands , and as glaciers recede and ice sheets melt , their runoff contributes to the rise .
The biggest impact , however , is expected to come from melting land ice in Greenland and Antarctica , if that occurs in large amounts . The uncertainty around that land ice – along with uncertainty on the pace of change – is what leads to very different predictions .
The National Climate Assessment , which summarizes risks to the US , projects that sea level will rise between 1 and 4 feet ( 0.3 to 1.2 m ) by 2100 . According to the most recent report by the International Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , sea levels will rise between .26 meters and .82 meters by 2100 ( roughly a 2-foot rise ) , depending on how emissions continue . That ’ s an estimate that most scientists see as very conservative , particularly given the amplification that can occur , if a triggering event happens to make a large chunk of an ice sheet break off .
“ You can imagine our climate system is like a pot of water on the stove , and we ’ re turning up the heat , but the water ’ s not heated up yet , ” says White .
Ultimately , he , along with many scientists , agree that the current levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will lead to sea level rises between 10 and 20 meters – but it may take many centuries for that to happen . “ We disagree on how high sea level will go at 400 ppm , and we disagree on where the thresholds are that would give you enough carbon dioxide to melt all of Antarctica , ” explains White .
One of the most controversial areas of climate change involves natural disasters . Will the world see more hurricanes and storms ? More droughts and floods ? Are we already seeing these impacts , and is climate change to blame for recent disasters ?
The research is murky . The IPCC says that “ it is very likely that heat waves will occur more often and last longer , and that extreme precipitation events will become more intense and frequent in many regions . ”
But there ’ s less data to back up increased frequency of hurricanes or tornadoes , and it can become very difficult to tease out , for any one natural disaster , whether a portion of its intensity is attributable to climate change .
And depending who you talk to , scientists offer very different predictions for regional change . “ In a warmer planet , the atmosphere holds more moisture , and the potential for big rainfall gets larger and larger , so both floods and droughts increase , ” says White . But which areas will get drier ? Which might have more floods ? “ This is where the models struggle . Getting the hydrologic cycles right in a model is not easy , ” he says .
Scientists have created varied complex models to make climate forecasts , and there is no consensus about how much , or how rapidly , the planet will warm . The most conservative models , assuming the lowest emissions , give an average temperature increase of about 2 degrees F over this century , while higher-emissions models suggest an increase of more than 11 degrees F over the century .
Even within a single baseline of assumptions about emissions , temperature forecasts can vary based on things like how global cloud cover will change under a given model .
Warming is likely to be more extreme at higher latitudes , and most models predict that summer sea ice will be gone from the Arctic by the end of the century .
Part of the reason for the disparity lies in the uncertainty about how carbon emissions may change over the coming century , and part lies in the complex ways in which small changes can have an amplifying effect , or a certain threshold can be crossed that leads to rapid change in a short period of time .
“ We are raising CO2 , [ and ] CO2 is having a warming effect on the climate : That ’ s as close to fact as scientists ever get , ” says Alley . “ There ’ s such an interwoven fabric of evidence at this point that any argument about it is noise. ” And asking scientists about those basic facts gets 97 percent or more to agree pretty consistently , he says . “ But if you write anything specific [ around detailed predictions ] you ’ ll find somebody will object to it , because there are several studies and they ’ re all slightly different . ”

The debate among climate scientists is n't always just about the details of specific forecasts . A few scientists worry aloud that a kind of groupthink and peer pressure is compromising public confidence in the quality of published research , as academics see their careers as tied to toeing acceptable lines .
But that critique is n't widely shared . In fact , given all the inquiry into different climate issues , many scientists say the big need is actually to help the public get a better sense of the strong consensus that exists on the core points that global warming is real and that it threatens significant harm to ecosystems and human societies .","Discussions of climate change often pit two polarized sides talking past each other, split along partisan political lines.

One of the most controversial areas of climate change involves natural disasters. Will the world see more hurricanes and storms? More droughts and floods? Are we already seeing these impacts, and is climate change to blame for recent disasters?

The research is murky. The IPCC says that “it is very likely that heat waves will occur more often and last longer, and that extreme precipitation events will become more intense and frequent in many regions.”

But there’s less data to back up increased frequency of hurricanes or tornadoes, and it can become very difficult to tease out, for any one natural disaster, whether a portion of its intensity is attributable to climate change.

And depending who you talk to, scientists offer very different predictions for regional change. “In a warmer planet, the atmosphere holds more moisture, and the potential for big rainfall gets larger and larger, so both floods and droughts increase,” says White. But which areas will get drier? Which might have more floods? “This is where the models struggle. Getting the hydrologic cycles right in a model is not easy,” he says.

How quickly will the planet warm?

Scientists have created varied complex models to make climate forecasts, and there is no consensus about how much, or how rapidly, the planet will warm. The most conservative models, assuming the lowest emissions, give an average temperature increase of about 2 degrees F over this century, while higher-emissions models suggest an increase of more than 11 degrees F over the century.

Even within a single baseline of assumptions about emissions, temperature forecasts can vary based on things like how global cloud cover will change under a given model.

Warming is likely to be more extreme at higher latitudes, and most models predict that summer sea ice will be gone from the Arctic by the end of the century.

Part of the reason for the disparity lies in the uncertainty about how carbon emissions may change over the coming century, and part lies in the complex ways in which small changes can have an amplifying effect, or a certain threshold can be crossed that leads to rapid change in a short period of time.

“We are raising CO2, [and] CO2 is having a warming effect on the climate: That’s as close to fact as scientists ever get,” says Alley. “There’s such an interwoven fabric of evidence at this point that any argument about it is noise.” And asking scientists about those basic facts gets 97 percent or more to agree pretty consistently, he says. “But if you write anything specific [around detailed predictions] you’ll find somebody will object to it, because there are several studies and they’re all slightly different.”

The debate among climate scientists isn't always just about the details of specific forecasts. A few scientists worry aloud that a kind of groupthink and peer pressure is compromising public confidence in the quality of published research, as academics see their careers as tied to toeing acceptable lines.

But that critique isn't widely shared. In fact, given all the inquiry into different climate issues, many scientists say the big need is actually to help the public get a better sense of the strong consensus that exists on the core points that global warming is real and that it threatens significant harm to ecosystems and human societies.",www.csmonitor.com,center,7ytsLATP3IysXH1e

What about Ralph Cavanagh 's claim that clean energy now costs less than dirty energy ?

On the other hand , the Energy Information Administration 's somewhat higher estimates do not find that unsubsidized wind and solar will become cost competitive with cheap natural gas by 2022 . Other research points out that increasing dependence on renewable energy means building back-up generation that can take over when clouds obscure the sun or wind dies down .
In any case , federal energy policy is not the only game in town .

Tajinder Singh, 47, a farmer in the North Indian state of Punjab, applied for a gun license. He told the authorities that he needed a revolver for self-defense. While tending to his 20 acres of land, he often had to walk long hours to reach home after nightfall. He wanted to protect himself from wild animals and bands of armed robbers.

Once the background checks were completed in June this year, Singh was told he had to fulfill one more condition to get his gun.

He had to submit two photos: One showing him planting 10 saplings on his property, and then another with the thriving trees one month later.

To mark World Environment Day in June, Chander Gaind had an idea. He's the deputy commissioner of the district of Ferozepur — roughly the equivalent of an American mayor. ""I thought about how much Punjabi people love guns,"" Gaind told NPR. ""We receive hundreds of applications for gun licenses from this district every year. Maybe I could get them to love caring for the environment too.""

And so he decided that anyone who applied for a gun license from this district, home to 2 million people, would need to sprout a green thumb first. And that's how the ten tree rule was born.

The goal wasn't to discourage people from getting a gun licence, Gaind says.

Gun licenses in India are already subject to stringent regulations. To apply, you need to pay a modest fee of $7-$30 and furnish a certificate of proof that you've completed a course in firearm handling and safety. You also need to provide a health certificate establishing your physical and mental health along with tax returns and other identity documents.

Before a license is issued, local police interview the applicant's family members and neighbors. In addition, the applicants must appear for an in-person interview with the issuing authority. All this is seen by police and administrative authorities as essential to ascertain whether one's need for a gun is valid. Anyone with a criminal record or a history of domestic abuse is immediately rejected.

According to statistics released by India's Home Ministry in 2016, India has over 3.3 million active gun licenses. Over 10% of these are estimated to come from the state of Punjab.

Gaind's idea was an attempt to make potential gun owners more environmentally aware.

""Over the years, the highways of Punjab have been widened. This has led to the loss of many trees. And in a state where we grow a lot of wheat and paddy, both crops that consume plenty of ground water, we needed to find a way to restore those resources,"" says Gaind.

His terms were met with amusement and surprising goodwill.

""It was a very unusual condition, but it made me happy to hear it,"" says Singh. ""I thought of all the different kinds of people applying for licenses — this rule will teach them something. It will do them good."" As an agriculturalist, he had no problem complying, he says. He planted a lime tree (Citrus aurantifolia) and trees native to Punjab like the baheda, tilkan, harad and sent the photos in.

At the end of July, Tajinder Singh received his license.

""It's a very interesting initiative,"" says Alok Kumar Dubey, a consultant in public policy and social development at the NITI Aayog (National Institute for Transforming India), the top think tank for the government of India. NITI Aayog encourages innovation — primarily in health, nutrition, education, agriculture, infrastructure and finance.

The message is clear : Pernicious global warming is upon us , and the government must act .
Bolstering this barrage of alarmism is last week ’ s finding from the federal government ’ s National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) that the global average surface temperature for August 2014 was the highest ever recorded for the month .
But the anomalous warmth in August still fell short of the all-time record for all months . That record was set nearly 200 months ago in February 1998 . And that ’ s the real news . In this era of human-caused global warming , what is taking so long to set a new global temperature record ?
During the 1980s and 1990s , new all-time record-high anomalies were occurring about every 3-4 years . But then , we hit the “ hiatus. ” The rise in the Earth ’ s average surface temperature basically stopped , “ global warming ” morphed into “ climate change , ” and it has been 16.5 years since the last all-time all-month record monthly temperature anomaly was set .
Just-published research from University of Guelph ’ s Ross McKitrick pegs the length of the hiatus , or “ pause ” —the period of no statistically significant rise in the earth ’ s average temperature—at about 19 years . Looking back even further , the U.N. ’ s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) shows that since the mid-20th century , observed global warming has been less than expected .

A couple of recent warm months do not make up for a failed legacy that extends more than a half century","President Obama will speak Tuesday, as world leaders assemble at the United Nations in New York for “Climate Summit 2014,” “to galvanize and catalyze climate action.” Environmentalists have taken note, organizing “the largest climate march in history,” to pressure governments to regulate “a world safe from the ravages of climate change.”

The message is clear: Pernicious global warming is upon us, and the government must act.

Bolstering this barrage of alarmism is last week’s finding from the federal government’s National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that the global average surface temperature for August 2014 was the highest ever recorded for the month.

But the anomalous warmth in August still fell short of the all-time record for all months. That record was set nearly 200 months ago in February 1998. And that’s the real news. In this era of human-caused global warming, what is taking so long to set a new global temperature record?

[pullquote]

During the 1980s and 1990s, new all-time record-high anomalies were occurring about every 3-4 years. But then, we hit the “hiatus.” The rise in the Earth’s average surface temperature basically stopped, “global warming” morphed into “climate change,” and it has been 16.5 years since the last all-time all-month record monthly temperature anomaly was set.

Just-published research from University of Guelph’s Ross McKitrick pegs the length of the hiatus, or “pause”—the period of no statistically significant rise in the earth’s average temperature—at about 19 years. Looking back even further, the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) shows that since the mid-20th century, observed global warming has been less than expected.

In short, all those computerized climate models that predicted large, accelerating, and generally uninterrupted warming were wrong. And it has the believers in those models scratching their heads.

Global warming is not proceeding as planned. The climate appears less sensitive to our emissions of greenhouse gases than expected. The urgency to grant the government the authority to limit energy choice is not justified.

That’s the real news.

Nevertheless, the scaremongers doggedly claim the world is still on course for a climate catastrophe of our own making. They point to the record high temperatures in August as proof that global warming remains a viable beast that will eventually strike us. Natural variability, they say, has just been holding the savage back. And its grip is slipping.

Climate models, apologists say, can’t possibly be expected to get the precise timing of all natural hiccups correct. Therefore, we shouldn’t get distracted by poor model performance over the short term (a decade or two) but rather rest assured that what the models predict over the long-term will be correct.

For this argument to work, natural variability, and not inadequacies in the climate models themselves, must be shown to be completely responsible for the two-decade hiatus. Otherwise, the jig is up and it will be plainly obvious that climate models are unreliable. And in that case, the foundations for climate alarm, for a carbon tax, and for the president’s Climate Action Plan crumble.

About five or six years ago, climate modelers and their supporters found it easier to claim the hiatus didn’t exist than to try to explain it. As more and more time passed and earth’s surface temperature failed to rise, the hiatus grew too noticeable to be swept under the rug. A chorus was rising that the length of the hiatus exceeded that foretold by climate models.

Climate catastrophists have gone from hiatus deniers to hiatus embracers, even going as far as to perversely claim that the hiatus actually strengthens the case for dangerous global warming.

It doesn’t.

At the very least, the lack of global temperature rise during the past two decades shows that climate models do not have a good handle on natural processes and the magnitude of their impact on the climate. More probably, it indicates that climate models predict too much warming from greenhouse gas emissions. Most likely, it is both.

On Wednesday afternoon during a press call with the Vietnamese prime minister , Nguyen Xuan Phuc , Trump was asked if he was leaning toward getting out , to which he replied : “ You ’ re going to find out very soon . ”
Asked whether he has been hearing from CEOs and others trying to persuade him on the climate agreement , Trump said : “ I ’ m hearing from a lot of people , both ways . Both ways . ”

This represents a shift in strategy from when House Democrats last controlled the chamber . In 2009 , they passed cap-and-trade legislation , which subsequently died in the Democratic-controlled Senate . The game plan for next year , House Democrats say , is more incremental steps and hearings .

Not all Democrats share that view . Faced with more data on a warming planet — and the role of human activity in exacerbating the trend — some lawmakers want the party to use its would-be majority to push a bold , sweeping package to hike the cost of carbon emissions .
Their urgency has been fueled by a new report from the United Nations ’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , which forecasts impacts like massive coral reef die-offs , increased drought and sea-level rise by 2040 if emissions are not significantly cut by 2030 . The report ’ s authors said current climate policies and the 2015 Paris agreement — which Trump promised to exit — are not nearly enough to avoid disaster .

Beyer acknowledged the political hurdles facing such a plan , not least Trump ’ s rejection of consensus climate science . But he sees a path for working with moderate Republican senators and getting a climate change bill to the president ’ s desk . If it gets that far , he thinks Trump — enticed by the opportunity to claim a victory — might change his tune .
“ Politically , it wouldn ’ t be smart for Democrats to give him a win , but we ’ re not talking about politics , we ’ re talking about the fate of the planet and the fate of humanity , ” Beyer said .

He ’ s pushing for a bipartisan carbon-fee bill that , if passed by the House , would then put pressure on Trump and Senate Republicans to act .
“ I ’ m not expecting the president to lead on this , ” he said , “ but I think Congress has an opportunity , the House has an opportunity , to move something forward — hopefully with bipartisan support — that the president would then have to respond to . ”

Progressive groups , a vocal part of Democrats ’ base , are certain to push for such an aggressive approach — as will many Democrats who launch 2020 presidential bids . Still , those lawmakers anticipating sweeping climate legislation appear to be in the minority , as more Democrats see a political environment that ’ s simply too hostile to move a major climate bill .
In a “ 60 Minutes ” interview that aired on Sunday , Trump addressed the changing climate : “ I think something ’ s happening . Something ’ s changing and it ’ ll change back again .

With President Trump Donald John TrumpAmash calls McCarthy incompetent, dishonest after '60 Minutes' interview GOP lawmaker blasts Trump for quoting pastor warning of civil war over impeachment '60 Minutes' correspondent presses McCarthy on impeachment inquiry MORE in the White House and Republicans favored to keep the Senate next year, climate legislation would face stiff headwinds, and pushing it could spark backlash from the right — both now and after the Nov. 6 midterm elections.

Considering those “constraints,” said Rep. Gerry Connolly Gerald (Gerry) Edward ConnollyThe Hill's Morning Report - Presented by National Association of Manufacturers - The impeachment of President Trump has begun DC statehood push faces long odds despite record support Democrat accuses GOP of opposing DC statehood because of 'race and partisanship' MORE (D-Va.), Democrats should “focus on the practical and the opportunistic” to make short-term progress while fighting for bolder measures — “the aspirational goals” — over the longer term.

“It’s going to be, I think, more of an opportunistic strategy, where, in various pieces of legislation, across the board, we’re going to insert measures that address climate change,” said Connolly, a leader in the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition.

The office of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiImpeachment fight poses wildcard for Trump economy Schiff says he plans to subpoena Giuliani for documents Trump demands to meet whistleblower, warns of 'Big Consequences' MORE (D-Calif.), a fierce environmentalist who ushered the cap-and-trade bill through the lower chamber almost a decade ago, declined to comment about the Democrats’ future climate plans. Pelosi has been touring the country stumping for Democratic candidates, with a focus on economic and health-care issues.

Others anticipate a piecemeal approach to climate policy if the Democrats win the chamber.

“I could imagine that we can do ancillary pieces that are very much reinforcing this issue and concern for climate change,” said Rep. Paul Tonko Paul David TonkoOvernight Energy: Trump tweets he's revoking California's tailpipe waiver | Move comes as Trump visits state | California prepares for court fight | Climate activist Greta Thunberg urges lawmakers to listen to scientists Democrats hold first hearing in push for clean energy by 2050 Democrats ramp up calls to investigate NOAA MORE (N.Y.), the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s environment subcommittee.

Not all Democrats share that view. Faced with more data on a warming planet — and the role of human activity in exacerbating the trend — some lawmakers want the party to use its would-be majority to push a bold, sweeping package to hike the cost of carbon emissions.

Their urgency has been fueled by a new report from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which forecasts impacts like massive coral reef die-offs, increased drought and sea-level rise by 2040 if emissions are not significantly cut by 2030. The report’s authors said current climate policies and the 2015 Paris agreement — which Trump promised to exit — are not nearly enough to avoid disaster.

“I do think we need to go big,” said Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.). “I’m all for incrementalism in policy. We do lots and lots of it, and it’s a good way to move forward. But this situation is so serious that we can’t do it in little steps.”

Beyer acknowledged the political hurdles facing such a plan, not least Trump’s rejection of consensus climate science. But he sees a path for working with moderate Republican senators and getting a climate change bill to the president’s desk. If it gets that far, he thinks Trump — enticed by the opportunity to claim a victory — might change his tune.

“Politically, it wouldn’t be smart for Democrats to give him a win, but we’re not talking about politics, we’re talking about the fate of the planet and the fate of humanity,” Beyer said.

Ted Deutch Theodore (Ted) Eliot DeutchGun epidemic is personal for lawmakers touched by violence House panel advances anti-gun violence legislation Gun debate to shape 2020 races MORE (D-Fla.), a co-chairman of the bipartisan, 90-member Climate Solutions Caucus, rejected the notion that pricing-up carbon is beyond reach, even in the current political environment. He’s pushing for a bipartisan carbon-fee bill that, if passed by the House, would then put pressure on Trump and Senate Republicans to act.

“I’m not expecting the president to lead on this,” he said, “but I think Congress has an opportunity, the House has an opportunity, to move something forward — hopefully with bipartisan support — that the president would then have to respond to.”

The Oregon Democrat said fighting carbon pollution will be “a top priority” if Democrats win the House.

“My preferred method has been a putting a price on carbon — cap-and-trade is complex and less efficient,” he said.

Progressive groups, a vocal part of Democrats’ base, are certain to push for such an aggressive approach — as will many Democrats who launch 2020 presidential bids. Still, those lawmakers anticipating sweeping climate legislation appear to be in the minority, as more Democrats see a political environment that’s simply too hostile to move a major climate bill.

In a “60 Minutes” interview that aired on Sunday, Trump addressed the changing climate: “I think something’s happening. Something’s changing and it’ll change back again. I don’t think it’s a hoax, I think there’s probably a difference. But I don’t know that it’s man-made.”

John Barrasso speaks at a Capitol Hill press conference in 2011 . ( AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin )
( ███ ) - `` It is time for the president to keep his word , stop stalling , give us his answer on the Keystone XL pipeline and approve the Keystone XL pipeline for the jobs that it will create , '' Sen. John Barrasso ( R-Wyo . ) said on Tuesday .
When President Obama met with Republicans on Capitol Hill last March , Barrasso says he `` specifically asked him about approving the Keystone XL pipeline . ''
`` And the president said his decision would come in a matter of months and certainly by the end of year . Since that time , we 've heard nothing from the president other than criticism and ridicule when he talked about the Keystone XL pipeline . But the end of the year is here now . ''
Barrasso noted that President Obama 's own State Department has said that construction of the pipeline would create 42,000 jobs .
On Tuesday , the same day Barrasso spoke , White House spokesman Jay Carney said President Obama `` is focused every day '' on growing the economy , expanding the middle class , and `` bringing jobs back home to the United States so that we can have the kinds of industries and businesses that create good jobs , that sustain secure middle-class lives . That 's his focus , '' Carney said .
So if the Keystone XL project creates jobs , what 's taking so long for the Obama administration to make a decision ? A reporter asked White House spokesman Josh Earnest about that last week . `` I mean , this has been going on for years , '' the reporter said .
Earnest said the Keystone approval process was `` slowed down '' by concerns raised by the Republican governor of Nebraska about the proposed route of the pipeline .
`` So I think that demonstrates the commitment of the administration to get this right . It demonstrates that there is -- that there are people in both parties who have a range of views on this topic . And , you know , what the State Department is doing is they 're reaching a determination of national interests . ''
Because the pipeline crosses the border with Canada , the State Department must approve it before construction begins .
The reporter asked Earnest if this is a case of the Obama administration `` running out the clock '' -- delaying a decision so the pipeline will never be built .
`` That 's not how I 'd characterize the ongoing policy process , '' Earnest responded .
As ███ reported , President Barack Obama said this past June that the Keystone XL pipeline would not be built if it created more carbon pollution .
“ Allowing the Keystone pipeline to be built requires finding that doing so would be in our nation ’ s interest , and our national interest will be served only if this project does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution , ” the president said . “ The net effect of the pipeline ’ s impact on our climate will be absolutely critical to determining whether this project is allowed to go forward . ''
In that same speech , Obama said , “ Our energy strategy must be about more than just producing more oil , and by the way , it ’ s certainly got to be about more than just building one pipeline . ”
The recent hiring of John Podesta as President Obama 's energy and climate-change adviser has some Keystone supporters worried . Podesta is on the record as opposing the Keystone project , but he has said he will stay out of any decisions on whether to proceed with pipeline construction .
Secretary of State John Kerry , with whom the Keystone decision now rests , is also a true believer in climate change .
In his first major foreign policy address last February , Kerry called for the United States to work with other nations to `` develop and deploy the clean technologies that will power a new world . ''
If it 's ever completed , the Keystone XL Pipeline would run 1,179 miles , carrying crude oil from Alberta , Canada to Steele City , Neb . From there , the pipeline extends to midwestern and Gulf Coast markets .
Because the pipeline crosses an international border , it falls to the U.S. State Department to decide whether the project is in the national interest . It 's then up to the president to say yes or no .
In August 2011 , the State Department issued a supposedly `` final '' environmental impact statement on the Keystone XL , saying the pipeline extension would not have a significant impact on the environment .
But following an outcry from environmental activists , the State Department three months later decided to seek additional information on alternative routes through the Nebraska Sand Hills .

Climate change remains one of the most controversial topics in America, with people resolutely divided along partisan battle lines. As fires rage tragically across Australia, flame wars flicker here, too, as we struggle to engage in meaningful discourse about climate change.

But better conversations are not only possible, they’re also relatively easy to bring about. The key is to change the script from the way the dialogue normally takes place:

1. Abandon the talking points. Many exchanges on climate change follow a depressingly familiar playbook. Memes, stale talking points and insults are lobbed at all who dare disagree. This drumbeat of acrimony is all around us: in the news media, among our political leaders and within our own communities. The first step is to avoid that dead end. When you encounter a talking point, resist the urge to fire back. Instead, take a deep breath and try to figure out what lies underneath the rhetoric.

2. Listening is the most underused and powerful communication skill. The quickest way to strengthen your own conversational effectiveness is simple but counterintuitive: Be quiet and be curious. Ask questions, listen to the answers and ask follow-ups. As you dig beyond the talking points, you can establish an entirely different type of conversation. Meanwhile, listening builds trust and sets the stage for deeper engagement.

3. Recognize the places of agreement. Persuading someone to adopt your values and worldview is basically impossible. Instead, look for the places where your values are already aligned. This becomes easy once you pause to listen, because most of us have more in common than we realize. For example, does anyone want more pollution in the world? Is anyone in favor of being left behind in the global transition to a modern energy system? Do we think it’s fair for corporations to pollute for free, while wielding outsize influence over the rules that protect public health? Probably not. Use this common ground to explore how we can work toward mutual goals.

4. The most robust solutions come from a wide constituency. No one has all the answers. We should be vigorously debating climate change, as long as we direct the discussion to ways to confront it. Broad perspectives — from liberals and conservatives, youthful and experienced, bold and cautious — are all needed to hone enduring solutions. Invite ideas and aspirations from those who don’t see the world the way you do, and you’re likely to hash out a richer dialogue than you’d have with like-minded friends.

5. Focus on immediate, common benefits. Not everyone cares about polar bears or coral reefs. Distant problems, no matter how dire, don’t feel as important as the here and now. But you don’t even have to mention climate change while having a conversation about solving it. Instead, talk about reducing pollution, improving public health, maximizing energy efficiency and leveraging American competitiveness. Those are fairly universal values that win easy support.

Talking it out:Learning to discuss complicated issues ahead of the election

We want to hear from you:Be a part of the solution to finding solutions. Tell us here.

Similarly, local actions and solutions can be less polarizing than high-level problems that seem intractable. The shuttering of an aging coal-fired power plant presents a tough transition for a community, but it also invites connecting over common goals. We all want jobs, relevance and a secure future. What paths offer our best shot at getting there?

Climate change is an awful problem that’s hard to confront. But many of the solutions offer widespread benefits, and a note of optimism can make your message more effective.

6. Learn as much as you can, then keep learning. If someone incorrectly claims that volcanoes pump out more carbon dioxide than humans do, you don’t need to get mad. Instead, leverage the misconception as an opening to talk about how the scale of human pollution overwhelms the pace of natural processes. The more you know, the easier it is to keep things productive, and the less likely you’ll get defensive.

Candidates on climate change:Review how the presidential contenders would address the global challenge.

7. The first step toward solving problems is accepting them. A small (but vocal) segment of the population insists that climate change is not an actual problem, or that there is no need to change our century-old ways of generating energy. Those positions are untenable, and people who have dug in their heels have unfortunately guaranteed their own irrelevance. If you want to have your voice heard, bring your ideas and concerns to the table, listen more than you speak, and then you’ll have a much better chance at becoming part of the conversation.

8.Try it! Venturing into a potentially difficult discussion can be intimidating. But if you start by seeking common ground, you can help bust the trend of endless bickering.

Cole's hometown of Moore, Okla., was nearly destroyed by the mile-wide storm. Cole said he had memories of working as a teenager at one of the local schools that was all but destroyed by the storm.

""Now you can't think about it without thinking about the horror that happened there,"" Cole said. ""The school was the safest, calmest building in the immediate area. Everybody made the right choice, they were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

""There's not a lot that can stand up to an F4 or an F5 [tornado],"" he added.

Cole said that after speaking with President Obama on Monday night he is confident the White House and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives will do what it takes to provide assistance to his constituents.

""A Democratic president and a Republican majority leader … I think they'll do the right thing and the congressmen will follow their lead,"" Cole said.",www.abcnews.go.com,left,uQ5AZyLU3zcdFTZQ

But in this rural corner of eastern Mississippi , the reality of so-called clean coal is n't pretty .
Mississippi Power Co. 's Kemper County plant here , meant to showcase technology for generating clean electricity from low-quality coal , ranks as one of the most-expensive U.S. fossil-fuel projects ever—at $ 4.7 billion and rising . Mississippi Power 's 186,000 customers , who live in one of the poorest regions of the country , are reeling at double-digit rate increases . And even Mississippi Power 's parent , Atlanta-based Southern Co . SO -0.08 % , has said Kemper should n't be used as a nationwide model .

Labor and material costs for the Kemper plant exceeded expectations . Bob Miller for The Wall Street Journal
One of just three clean-coal plants moving ahead in the U.S. , Kemper has been such a calamity for Southern that the power industry and Wall Street analysts say other utilities are n't likely to take on similar projects , even though the federal government plans to offer financial incentives .
Southern recently took $ 990 million in charges for cost overruns approaching $ 2 billion . The company 's stock has been battered in the past year , and the company 's market value has dropped $ 6.4 billion since April , to $ 35.8 billion . Mississippi Power 's credit rating has dropped to three notches above junk .
Kemper `` is scaring people away , '' says Michael Haggarty , an analyst for Moody 's Investors Service in New York .
And clean coal 's costs have looked even worse recently in comparison with a new inexpensive alternative : plants fueled by the natural gas unleashed by a U.S. drilling boom . Southern last year decided against purchasing a 10-year-old gas-fired plant in Jackson , Miss. , that would have generated about as much electricity as Kemper . Another company bought it for $ 206 million , billions less than Kemper will cost .
Rising on what was once farmland here , the 582-megawatt Kemper plant is designed to convert a low grade of coal , lignite , into clean-burning syngas , which is similar to natural gas . As part of that process , the plant will strip out and capture 65 % of the carbon dioxide , a greenhouse gas , that would have been released into the atmosphere by burning coal . Turning coal to gas before burning it , or gasification , has proved necessary for capturing CO2 because efforts to cull it from plants that burn coal have n't been practical .
Keeping CO2 out of the atmosphere is a goal of the Obama administration 's since greenhouse gases have been implicated in climate change . The government last month set limits on CO2 emissions from new power plants and cited Kemper as evidence that power plants could meet the new standards .
`` We 're confident plants of the future will be built with this technology , '' says Janet McCabe , acting assistant administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency . The administration 's pollutions limits , she says , are `` practical and achievable . ''
Ed Holland , chief executive of Mississippi Power , says the federal plan to limit greenhouse-gas emissions `` bodes well for this technology . '' While expensive , he says , it is `` one of the few alternatives available allowing us to continue to use coal . ''
But Southern last month said Kemper `` can not be consistently replicated on a national level '' and therefore `` should not serve as a primary basis for new emissions standards . ''
Federal officials say it is n't unusual for new technology to be expensive at first and that clean coal 's costs should come down over time .
Through various subsidies , the federal government had committed nearly $ 700 million for the Mississippi Power plant , though part of that was the $ 133 million that the utility will forfeit because of delays . For decades , under Democratic and Republican administrations , the department has poured billions of dollars into clean-coal research and development , sometimes working with Southern 's `` test kitchen '' for new technology near Wilsonville , Ala .
Demonstration projects have n't gone smoothly . The Department of Energy spent several hundred million dollars on two early clean-coal projects in the 1990s that had a series of technical problems .
Southern proposed building a clean-coal plant in Florida in 2005 but canceled the project in 2007 after state officials expressed anticoal sentiments .
Mississippi officials welcomed Kemper two years later , however . Republican Haley Barbour , governor at the time , was happy to see Mississippi Power use large deposits of lignite that had `` virtually no value , '' he says today . He still supports the project , and his lobbying firm does work for Southern . `` This is cutting-edge technology , '' he says .
The Mississippi Public Service Commission approved Kemper , fearing that the price of the natural gas that powers many plants in the state would increase , says Leonard Bentz , who was a commissioner until August .
Mississippi Power told the commission in 2009 that natural gas could hit $ 20 per million British thermal units and would drop no lower than $ 7.38 between 2014 and 2054 . The forecast was filed confidentially , so was n't subject to public review . The Journal obtained a redacted copy from the utility after filing a request under public-records law .
Its forecast was made even after energy companies had discovered a way to pull gas from previously inaccessible shale-rock formations . The resulting glut means that natural-gas prices have n't topped $ 6 per million BTUs since January 2009 . Today , they are around $ 3.75 .
Jeff Burleson , vice president of system planning for Southern , says the projections look flawed today because the industry was `` in transition from conventional gas to shale gas '' in 2009 .
The company in June 2010 won state approval to go ahead with the project and by that December had broken ground on a 3,000-acre tract .
Kemper 's cost , previously projected at around $ 2.9 billion , soon began to soar . Southern recently estimated the price tag at $ 4.7 billion . The utility says it underestimated labor costs and the amount of steel pipe , concrete and other materials it would need for so big a plant .
Because the state Legislature allowed Southern to charge customers for the plant 's costs before it began generating power , customer rates began to rise , jumping 15 % this year . A 3 % increase is scheduled for next year , though the company is seeking 7 % .
Criticism has been growing from environmental groups , tea-party activists and some business leaders , who fear that rising electricity rates will make Mississippi less competitive .
The state chapter of the Sierra Club , which has been trying to block the plant , says public opinion is shifting in the club 's favor . `` When it first came out , it was the greatest thing since sliced bread , '' says Louie Miller , state director of the environmental group . `` Now everyone has turned against it .

Regulators and Southern agreed in January to cap costs that customers would cover at $ 2.88 billion , far below the $ 4.7 billion projected cost . But Southern recently won approval from the Legislature to sell up to $ 1 billion in bonds to help cover about half the difference ; customers will repay the bonds through a surcharge on bills .

environment,Democracy Now,0,https://www.democracynow.org/2019/5/9/shocking_un_report_warns_up_to,Shocking UN Report Warns up to a Million Species are at Risk of Extinction Due to Human Activity,2019-05-09,,"This is a rush transcript . Copy may not be in its final form .
AMY GOODMAN : This is ███ ! I ’ m Amy Goodman , with Nermeen Shaikh .
NERMEEN SHAIKH : An alarming new report by a panel of leading scientists warns that human activity is causing the disappearance and deterioration of wildlife at a rate that could represent an existential threat to humanity within our lifetimes . The United Nations ’ Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services released its conclusions earlier this week and found that 1 million species could go extinct in the foreseeable future unless current trends are reversed . The study estimates the global extinction rate is , quote , “ already at least tens to hundreds of times higher than it averaged over the past 10 million years . ”
It ’ s the largest and most comprehensive global study of biodiversity ever . It took three years to complete and is based on 15,000 scientific papers . The landmark report singled out industrial farming and fishing as major drivers of the crisis and called for transformative change to arrest present trends of biodiversity loss and species extinction . The report will be released in full later this year . This is chair of the U.N. panel , Sir Robert Watson .
ROBERT WATSON : We ’ re losing species at a historical rate . Potentially 500,000 to a million species are threatened with loss . We have lost much of our native forests , much of our native wetlands . And effectively , biodiversity needs to be considered as an equally important issue as climate change . It ’ s not just an environmental issue ; it is an economic issue , a development issue , a security issue , a social , moral and ethical issue .
AMY GOODMAN : To talk more about the report , we ’ re joined by two guests . In Minneapolis , Kate Brauman is with us , one of the coordinating lead authors of the U.N. science report , environmental scientist at University of Minnesota . And here in New York , Ashley Dawson is joining us , professor of postcolonial studies at City University of New York Graduate Center and College of Staten Island . His books include Extinction : A Radical History .
We welcome you both to ███ ! Kate Brauman , you ’ re one of the lead authors on this report . A million species going extinct ? Explain .
KATE BRAUMAN : It is really shocking . What we ’ ve done is that a bunch of experts have looked at really what the trends look like for many , many different species , including insects . And looking at those trends , it ’ s quite clear that up to a million species , 25 % of all of the animals on Earth , are threatened with extinction , many within the next couple of decades , unless we change our activities .
NERMEEN SHAIKH : And what most surprised you , Kate , about this report as you were working on the research ?
KATE BRAUMAN : The thing to me that ’ s the most shocking is really just what the picture looks like when we bring it all together . So , this report is an assessment . It ’ s designed to bring together the incredibly large existing body of research . This was not designed to do new research . And so , much of this has been known . What we ’ ve done is really bring together all the pieces and lay them out clearly , so that we can see what a big problem this is .
AMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about the threat to biodiversity , ongoing species extinction and climate change ?
KATE BRAUMAN : What we see is that there are a lot of different drivers that are causing this to happen and that they all interact with each other . So , probably the biggest threat to species to date has been land use change . We have made so many changes on the Earth , particularly through farming , but also through roads , through timber harvest , and that ’ s had a tremendous impact . But it interacts with climate change , and so what we see is that these interacting effects of land use change , climate , pollution , species extraction , that they all work together to really make huge threats to the environment and to us as humans .
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Well , I want to bring Ashley Dawson into the conversation . Ashley , you have written an entire book on the radical history of extinction . Your response to this report ?
ASHLEY DAWSON : Well , the report , I think , is really a landmark report . And it shows that the crisis we face isn ’ t just one of climate change . In some ways it ’ s comparable to the IPCC report from last October , which really sounded a really important alarm about the system that we face and its potential collapse . But what this shows is it ’ s a crisis of multiple different dimensions and that it ’ s driven by an economic system which is fundamentally destroying the terrestrial systems that we all depend on .
NERMEEN SHAIKH : Well , I ’ d like to turn to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo ’ s recent comments on the Arctic . Just hours after the release of the U.N. report , Pompeo celebrated the shrinking levels of sea ice in the region , saying it opened up new opportunities for trade . He also called for the exploitation of natural resources in the Arctic .
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO : The Arctic is at the forefront of opportunity and abundance . It houses 13 % of the world ’ s undiscovered oil , 30 % of its undiscovered gas and an abundance of uranium , rare earth minerals , gold , diamonds and millions of square miles of untapped resources . Fisheries galore . … Steady reductions in sea ice are opening new passageways and new opportunities for trade . … Arctic sea lanes could come before the—could become the 21st century Suez and Panama Canals . ”
NERMEEN SHAIKH : So scientists warn that melting sea ice in the Arctic due to climate change will have catastrophic effects on coastal cities , biodiversity and the global economy . President Trump , of course , has called climate change a Chinese hoax . So , Ashley , your response to what Pompeo said just hours after this U.N. report was released ?
ASHLEY DAWSON : I think it typifies a kind of extractivist attitude , which , as I said , is destroying the planet . I mean , to give one concrete instance , we have been exploiting land so much and degrading land that we only have about 60 harvests left . Right ? Sixty agricultural harvests left .
ASHLEY DAWSON : It means about only 60 more years of food , potentially . So , we ’ re not only talking about a kind of crash of biodiversity and potential extinction for a lot of species out there ; we ’ re talking about a kind of fundamental crisis of humanity , its relationship to the natural world and our relations to one another .
AMY GOODMAN : And he ’ s saying , if the ice melts , it opens up possibilities for trade . It means you can get another Panama or Suez Canal .
ASHLEY DAWSON : Yeah , it gives new meaning to Naomi Klein ’ s term “ disaster capitalism. ” Right ? I mean , this is really about yoking the planet as we push it towards unsustainability .
AMY GOODMAN : I want to get your response to this , as well , Kate Brauman , that if the sea ice melts , it just opens up opportunities for trade .
KATE BRAUMAN : Well , I will say that I see it as an opportunity , but as an opportunity for doing things better . One of the things we talk about a lot in this report is that we are not hopeless , that there are a lot of potential ways that we can have a better future . And one of those is really having better intergovernmental cooperation . The Arctic is a place where intergovernmental cooperation has happened in the past . And we have the opportunity to really manage and steward these resources in a positive way that can be a model for the way we think about the planet . Part of that is going to be really integrating what we know from indigenous and local cultures , many of whom have lived in these regions for a long time , into the way that we do management .
AMY GOODMAN : Ashley Dawson , you talk about radical conservation . What does that look like ? And you particularly talk about cities . I am intrigued by the title of your book , Extreme Cities : The Peril and Promise of Urban Life in the Age of Climate Change .
ASHLEY DAWSON : Right . Well , so , right now we have a system of agribusiness that ’ s based on using fossil fuels for pesticides , fertilizers , and exploiting the land as much as possible . And we clearly need to shift . And one of the things that ’ s really wonderful about this report is that it explicitly talks about shifting that system to one that ’ s based on agroecology , using natural inputs , not using all of these pesticides that are destroying pollinators like bee populations and other insects .
And we don ’ t just need to think about that happening outside cities , right ? Now the majority of humanity lives in cities . And so cities can also be a place for rewilding , for increasing some of the wetlands , for instance , that we have plowed under , and , by doing that , for absorbing more carbon . So I agree with Kate about how this report is sounding an alarm , but it ’ s also calling for really important shifts in attitude and material changes that can put us on a different course .
NERMEEN SHAIKH : What does that say , Ashley , about the kind of structural transformations that would be required minimally for the economic system that governs at this point large parts of the planet , which is based on endless expansion and consumption by larger and larger numbers of people at greater levels ?
ASHLEY DAWSON : Yeah . I think it ’ s the greater levels that ’ s really key . I mean , the report does talk about the issue of population increase , but it also makes it quite clear that it ’ s inequality and a kind of capitalist system that ’ s based on constantly ramping up consumption of natural resources that is at fault , and that we need to shift away from that system .
ASHLEY DAWSON : What is the alternative ? The alternative is a kind of Green New Deal for the planet . And the authors of the system talk about that . They say quite explicitly that we need a values shift and a material shift towards more sustainable forms of engagement with the planet .
NERMEEN SHAIKH : And , Kate , this report comes on the heels of several other climate reports , biodiversity reports . What is it that this report says that these other reports have not concluded ?
KATE BRAUMAN : This report does a couple of different things . It brings together a wider body of evidence and really makes a point of elevating what we know from indigenous and local cultures .

AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.

NERMEEN SHAIKH: An alarming new report by a panel of leading scientists warns that human activity is causing the disappearance and deterioration of wildlife at a rate that could represent an existential threat to humanity within our lifetimes. The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services released its conclusions earlier this week and found that 1 million species could go extinct in the foreseeable future unless current trends are reversed. The study estimates the global extinction rate is, quote, “already at least tens to hundreds of times higher than it averaged over the past 10 million years.”

It’s the largest and most comprehensive global study of biodiversity ever. It took three years to complete and is based on 15,000 scientific papers. The landmark report singled out industrial farming and fishing as major drivers of the crisis and called for transformative change to arrest present trends of biodiversity loss and species extinction. The report will be released in full later this year. This is chair of the U.N. panel, Sir Robert Watson.

ROBERT WATSON: We’re losing species at a historical rate. Potentially 500,000 to a million species are threatened with loss. We have lost much of our native forests, much of our native wetlands. And effectively, biodiversity needs to be considered as an equally important issue as climate change. It’s not just an environmental issue; it is an economic issue, a development issue, a security issue, a social, moral and ethical issue.

AMY GOODMAN: To talk more about the report, we’re joined by two guests. In Minneapolis, Kate Brauman is with us, one of the coordinating lead authors of the U.N. science report, environmental scientist at University of Minnesota. And here in New York, Ashley Dawson is joining us, professor of postcolonial studies at City University of New York Graduate Center and College of Staten Island. His books include Extinction: A Radical History.

We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Kate Brauman, you’re one of the lead authors on this report. A million species going extinct? Explain.

KATE BRAUMAN: It is really shocking. What we’ve done is that a bunch of experts have looked at really what the trends look like for many, many different species, including insects. And looking at those trends, it’s quite clear that up to a million species, 25% of all of the animals on Earth, are threatened with extinction, many within the next couple of decades, unless we change our activities.

NERMEEN SHAIKH: And what most surprised you, Kate, about this report as you were working on the research?

KATE BRAUMAN: The thing to me that’s the most shocking is really just what the picture looks like when we bring it all together. So, this report is an assessment. It’s designed to bring together the incredibly large existing body of research. This was not designed to do new research. And so, much of this has been known. What we’ve done is really bring together all the pieces and lay them out clearly, so that we can see what a big problem this is.

AMY GOODMAN: Can you talk about the threat to biodiversity, ongoing species extinction and climate change?

KATE BRAUMAN: What we see is that there are a lot of different drivers that are causing this to happen and that they all interact with each other. So, probably the biggest threat to species to date has been land use change. We have made so many changes on the Earth, particularly through farming, but also through roads, through timber harvest, and that’s had a tremendous impact. But it interacts with climate change, and so what we see is that these interacting effects of land use change, climate, pollution, species extraction, that they all work together to really make huge threats to the environment and to us as humans.

NERMEEN SHAIKH: Well, I want to bring Ashley Dawson into the conversation. Ashley, you have written an entire book on the radical history of extinction. Your response to this report?

ASHLEY DAWSON: Well, the report, I think, is really a landmark report. And it shows that the crisis we face isn’t just one of climate change. In some ways it’s comparable to the IPCC report from last October, which really sounded a really important alarm about the system that we face and its potential collapse. But what this shows is it’s a crisis of multiple different dimensions and that it’s driven by an economic system which is fundamentally destroying the terrestrial systems that we all depend on.

NERMEEN SHAIKH: Well, I’d like to turn to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s recent comments on the Arctic. Just hours after the release of the U.N. report, Pompeo celebrated the shrinking levels of sea ice in the region, saying it opened up new opportunities for trade. He also called for the exploitation of natural resources in the Arctic.

SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO: The Arctic is at the forefront of opportunity and abundance. It houses 13% of the world’s undiscovered oil, 30% of its undiscovered gas and an abundance of uranium, rare earth minerals, gold, diamonds and millions of square miles of untapped resources. Fisheries galore. … Steady reductions in sea ice are opening new passageways and new opportunities for trade. … Arctic sea lanes could come before the—could become the 21st century Suez and Panama Canals.”

NERMEEN SHAIKH: So scientists warn that melting sea ice in the Arctic due to climate change will have catastrophic effects on coastal cities, biodiversity and the global economy. President Trump, of course, has called climate change a Chinese hoax. So, Ashley, your response to what Pompeo said just hours after this U.N. report was released?

ASHLEY DAWSON: I think it typifies a kind of extractivist attitude, which, as I said, is destroying the planet. I mean, to give one concrete instance, we have been exploiting land so much and degrading land that we only have about 60 harvests left. Right? Sixty agricultural harvests left.

NERMEEN SHAIKH: What does that mean?

ASHLEY DAWSON: It means about only 60 more years of food, potentially. So, we’re not only talking about a kind of crash of biodiversity and potential extinction for a lot of species out there; we’re talking about a kind of fundamental crisis of humanity, its relationship to the natural world and our relations to one another.

AMY GOODMAN: And he’s saying, if the ice melts, it opens up possibilities for trade. It means you can get another Panama or Suez Canal.

ASHLEY DAWSON: Yeah, it gives new meaning to Naomi Klein’s term “disaster capitalism.” Right? I mean, this is really about yoking the planet as we push it towards unsustainability.

AMY GOODMAN: I want to get your response to this, as well, Kate Brauman, that if the sea ice melts, it just opens up opportunities for trade.

KATE BRAUMAN: Well, I will say that I see it as an opportunity, but as an opportunity for doing things better. One of the things we talk about a lot in this report is that we are not hopeless, that there are a lot of potential ways that we can have a better future. And one of those is really having better intergovernmental cooperation. The Arctic is a place where intergovernmental cooperation has happened in the past. And we have the opportunity to really manage and steward these resources in a positive way that can be a model for the way we think about the planet. Part of that is going to be really integrating what we know from indigenous and local cultures, many of whom have lived in these regions for a long time, into the way that we do management.

AMY GOODMAN: Ashley Dawson, you talk about radical conservation. What does that look like? And you particularly talk about cities. I am intrigued by the title of your book, Extreme Cities: The Peril and Promise of Urban Life in the Age of Climate Change.

ASHLEY DAWSON: Right. Well, so, right now we have a system of agribusiness that’s based on using fossil fuels for pesticides, fertilizers, and exploiting the land as much as possible. And we clearly need to shift. And one of the things that’s really wonderful about this report is that it explicitly talks about shifting that system to one that’s based on agroecology, using natural inputs, not using all of these pesticides that are destroying pollinators like bee populations and other insects.

And we don’t just need to think about that happening outside cities, right? Now the majority of humanity lives in cities. And so cities can also be a place for rewilding, for increasing some of the wetlands, for instance, that we have plowed under, and, by doing that, for absorbing more carbon. So I agree with Kate about how this report is sounding an alarm, but it’s also calling for really important shifts in attitude and material changes that can put us on a different course.

NERMEEN SHAIKH: What does that say, Ashley, about the kind of structural transformations that would be required minimally for the economic system that governs at this point large parts of the planet, which is based on endless expansion and consumption by larger and larger numbers of people at greater levels?

ASHLEY DAWSON: Yeah. I think it’s the greater levels that’s really key. I mean, the report does talk about the issue of population increase, but it also makes it quite clear that it’s inequality and a kind of capitalist system that’s based on constantly ramping up consumption of natural resources that is at fault, and that we need to shift away from that system.

AMY GOODMAN: What is the alternative?

ASHLEY DAWSON: What is the alternative? The alternative is a kind of Green New Deal for the planet. And the authors of the system talk about that. They say quite explicitly that we need a values shift and a material shift towards more sustainable forms of engagement with the planet.

NERMEEN SHAIKH: And, Kate, this report comes on the heels of several other climate reports, biodiversity reports. What is it that this report says that these other reports have not concluded?

KATE BRAUMAN: This report does a couple of different things. It brings together a wider body of evidence and really makes a point of elevating what we know from indigenous and local cultures. It makes a really explicit tie from human activities to biodiversity to human well-being. And then it points us in positive directions for the future. I think Ashley really summed this up right: We are identifying the need to really have transformational change, to redefine what it means to live well in a way that reduces our consumption and changes our production.

AMY GOODMAN: Let me ask you, Ashley Dawson, about the anthropocentric nature of the report as it frames species’ survival as a matter of human survival, perhaps concerned that humans won’t care that a million species will go extinct unless it’s put in terms of human beings going extinct.

ASHLEY DAWSON: Right, right. Well, you know, there is something about the report that is influenced by the times we live in. It’s called a report not just on biodiversity, but ecosystem services. And so that kind of neoliberal calculus is very evident from the report’s title itself. But I think that the report is sounding these alarm bells and not discounting the innate validity and importance of the natural world and of other life forms. It just wants to emphasize how intertwined we all are at this point—right?—and how we can’t break that link.

AMY GOODMAN: And, Kate Brauman, if you’d like to respond to that?

KATE BRAUMAN: I agree. It is an anthropocentric take. And that, I think, is very important, because, as Ashley says, we are not separate or unlinked from the environment. And stewarding the environment, whether we’re doing it for personal gain or because we care, is what we as humans are doing. And that brings us to the center in ways that I think are very important in terms of moving forward and changing our behavior and changing this trajectory.

AMY GOODMAN: And do you see policymakers responding?

KATE BRAUMAN: I think so. One of the things that’s so exciting about this is that it is a report of the governments. There are 132 member states who are part of his platform, and they approved this document. This is something that governments say “we think is important.”

AMY GOODMAN: We want to thank you both for being with us. Of course, we’re going to link to the report.

On Tuesday, President Obama announced a series of executive actions aimed at reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, with hopes of mitigating climate changes. His “Climate Action Plan” is neither necessary nor effective, but it will be costly.

By promoting limits on greenhouse-gas emissions from U.S. power plants while increasing “green”-energy incentives, the president is trying to steer our energy choices away from the free-market course and toward the direction of his liking.

This is a dangerous undertaking, and one with a far-from-certain outcome. Government intervention in financial markets was the root of the Great Recession. Government intervention in the energy market carries an even greater risk, as energy drives everything.

The justification for this risk is just not there.

U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions are already on the decline and have been for about a decade now. The majority of this downward trend is not the result of government regulations restricting greenhouse-gas emissions, but rather technological innovations in the energy industry. Techniques such has horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, commonly known as fracking, have opened expansive natural gas and oil reserves that were considered unrecoverable only a few years ago.

Consequently, cheap, reliable electricity produced by coal is being replaced by even cheaper, reliable electricity from natural gas.

Because of its chemical makeup, natural gas, when burned, produces about half the amount of greenhouse gas emissions as burning coal. Therefore, as natural gas replaces coal as fuel for generating electricity, our greenhouse-gas emissions fall.

Granted, this is an unforeseen outcome. Natural gas fracking was developed to produce a cheaper fuel and outperform the competition, not to produce less greenhouse-gas emissions. The net result, though, is exactly the type of outcome that Mr. Obama wants to happen — a reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions — and it has been achieved without government incentives, taxes, or restrictions.

All the government had to do was stay out of the way.

In fact, it is arguable that had the government imposed regulations handicapping fossil fuels, these production techniques — now a cornerstone of Mr. Obama’s Climate Action Plan — may never have been fully developed as research efforts could have been diverted elsewhere.

Greenhouse-gas emissions in the U.S. are falling at a rate that is greater than the one laid out in the president’s plan. So why get involved at all?

When it comes to significantly slowing human-caused climate change — the reason for the Climate Action Plan in the first place — none of this matters anyway.

Scientific research suggests that global warming is proceeding, and will continue, at a slower pace, with fewer negative impacts than current projections indicate, including those underlying the president’s plan. On top of this, the U.S. relative contribution to climate change is declining year after year as greenhouse-gas emissions from developing nations, such as China, expand rapidly.

Together, this means that the president’s plan for reducing emissions in the United States effectively will have no impact on the local, regional or global climate. Domestic reductions will not produce any demonstrable change in the weather; there will be not be verifiably fewer tornadoes, hurricanes, droughts, floods, wildfires, heat waves or any other manner of extreme weather. The rise in the number of billion-dollar weather disasters highlighted by the president will continue — driven by the fact that there are more people with more stuff in harm’s way, not by human-caused climate change.

The president recognizes that actions in the United States alone will be insufficient to change the course of the climate. A global effort is required. Therefore, what the president really hopes to achieve is not direct climate-change mitigation from reducing U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions, but to gain bargaining power at international talks to address climate change and, ultimately, that low-emitting energy technologies will be developed and deployed rapidly and safely around the world.

Yet there is no guarantee of these outcomes.

Nevertheless, our own president is pursuing actions that are akin to holding Americans hostage to limited energy choices — and probably higher energy prices — while hoping that the rest of the world someday will pay the ransom in the form of a reduction in greenhouse emissions.

Rather than this wait-and-hope attitude, the president ought to encourage actions that would enable us to better fend for ourselves no matter what the future brings — actions aimed at expanding our energy resources, increasing our wealth and improving our resilience for the climate challenges that lie ahead. This path would be paved with less government interference, not more.

Donald Trump will launch a major assault on Barack Obama ’ s climate change legacy on Tuesday with a series of orders that undermine America ’ s commitment to the Paris agreement .
Asked by ███ if Trump accepted the science of manmade climate change , a senior White House official replied : “ Sure , yes , I guess , I think the president understands the disagreement over the policy response and you ’ ll see that in the order … We ’ re taking a different path . ”
Trump 's order signals end of US dominance in climate change battle Read more
Trump will sign executive orders and presidential memoranda that suspend , rescind or review several measures that were central to Obama ’ s effort to combat global warming . They include a review of the clean power plan , which restricts greenhouse gas emissions at coal-fired power plants .
Trump , who has called global warming a “ hoax ” , has criticised the power-plant rule and others as placing an unnecessary burden on American workers and the struggling US coal industry .
The official acknowledged the orders ’ effects would not be immediate , especially in view of legal challenges . “ I would bet a good deal I ’ m sure there ’ ll be litigation … Whether that ’ s three years , two years or one year , I don ’ t know . It ’ s going to take some time . ”
The US agreed to cut its greenhouse gas emissions 26-28 % by 2025 compared with 2005 levels under the Paris agreement . Obama ’ s clean power plan is the chief policy designed to lower US emissions . In 2015 it was billed as the strongest action ever on climate change by a US president but criticised for targeting coal-fired power plants .
Richard Lazarus , an environmental law expert at Harvard University , said : “ It was launched before Paris for a reason . Everyone knew if the United States didn ’ t make a serious commitment , Paris wouldn ’ t happen . It ’ s now an open question how the rest of the world is going to respond if the United States eliminates a linchpin of its commitment . ”
Trump will also aim to wipe out Obama ’ s climate action plan , the 2013 directive outlining the government ’ s response to climate change . His orders will lift a 14-month-old moratorium on new coal leases on federal lands , while a major hydraulic fracturing ( fracking ) regulation will be reviewed .
Guidelines published by the White House Council on Environmental Quality last August will be rescinded . Estimates of the social costs of carbon and other greenhouses gases will be overturned because they were not put out in “ a transparent fashion ” , the White House official said .
Aides insisted the official speak without being named , despite Trump ’ s past criticism of the use of unnamed sources . The official said the measures were aimed at achieving the goal of energy independence . “ We want to take our own course and do it in our own fashion . ”
Climate change is “ an issue that deserves attention but again I think the president ’ s been very clear he ’ s not going to pursue a climate or environmental policies that put the US economy at risk ” , he said . “ It ’ s very simple . ”
Trump and his allies , including Scott Pruitt of the Environmental Protection Agency , have previously criticised the 2016 Paris climate accord involving nearly 200 countries . The official said on Monday : “ In terms of the Paris agreement , whether we stay in or not is still under discussion . ”
Asked what message he wanted to send to major carbon producers such as China and India , the official said : “ I think the United States is going to pursue its interests as it sees fit . I think the president ’ s been very clear about having an America-first energy policy . We have a lot of energy in this country and the president wants to continue to remove any obstacles so we can produce . ”
The official was pressed by reporters on how climate change should be tackled . He said : “ One , you ’ ve got to make sure you have a strong economy . You ’ ve got to make sure you have people who are actually working . To the extent that the economy is strong and growing and in prosperity , that ’ s the best way to protect the environment . ”
PBS is the only network reporting on climate change . Trump wants to cut it | Dana Nuccitelli Read more
He said natural gas , clean coal , nuclear and renewables were part of the mix but added : “ Look globally . The more prosperous the economies … if you compare the United States to other economies , we have a cleaner , healthier environment than other countries that don ’ t . I mean , look at China . ”
The official insisted : “ The previous administration devalued workers by their policies . We ’ re saying we can do both : we can protect the environment and provide people with work and keep the economy going and that ’ s the policy agenda we ’ re going to focus on . ”
The 2015 clean power plan has been on hold since 2016 while a federal appeals court considers a challenge by coal-friendly states and more than 100 companies . The attempt to roll it back completely will meet with fierce opposition .
Tomás Carbonell , director of regulatory policy and senior attorney at the Environmental Defense Fund , said the White House must adhere to the same process of public notice and comment that was followed in adopting the plan , which took almost two years .
“ Large majorities of Americans in red and blue states alike support strong action to reduce carbon pollution from the nation ’ s power plants , and the clean power plan is supported by a broad and diverse coalition of states , municipalities , power companies , leading businesses , consumer advocates , faith organizations and many others , ” he said .
“ These supporters will turn out in force to oppose the administration ’ s outrageous attack on the United States ’ only nationwide limits on carbon pollution from power plants – safeguards that are essential to protecting our public health , securing a clean energy economy and yielding a safer climate for our children . ”
Travis Nichols , a spokesman for Greenpeace , said : “ This proposed executive order gives us further proof that Trump isn ’ t a leader , he ’ s just a fossil fuel industry stooge with a presidential pen . Thankfully , for all his bluster , the best Trump can do is delay America ’ s inevitable transition to clean energy , but he can ’ t stop it .
“ The problem , of course , is how much devastation his administration will inflict on the climate , vulnerable communities and the environment in the meantime . With this proposed executive order the Trump administration is simply putting America further behind in the global race towards a renewable future . ”

Donald Trump will launch a major assault on Barack Obama’s climate change legacy on Tuesday with a series of orders that undermine America’s commitment to the Paris agreement.

Asked by the Guardian if Trump accepted the science of manmade climate change, a senior White House official replied: “Sure, yes, I guess, I think the president understands the disagreement over the policy response and you’ll see that in the order … We’re taking a different path.”

Trump will sign executive orders and presidential memoranda that suspend, rescind or review several measures that were central to Obama’s effort to combat global warming. They include a review of the clean power plan, which restricts greenhouse gas emissions at coal-fired power plants.

Trump, who has called global warming a “hoax”, has criticised the power-plant rule and others as placing an unnecessary burden on American workers and the struggling US coal industry.

The official acknowledged the orders’ effects would not be immediate, especially in view of legal challenges. “I would bet a good deal I’m sure there’ll be litigation … Whether that’s three years, two years or one year, I don’t know. It’s going to take some time.”

The US agreed to cut its greenhouse gas emissions 26-28% by 2025 compared with 2005 levels under the Paris agreement. Obama’s clean power plan is the chief policy designed to lower US emissions. In 2015 it was billed as the strongest action ever on climate change by a US president but criticised for targeting coal-fired power plants.

Richard Lazarus, an environmental law expert at Harvard University, said: “It was launched before Paris for a reason. Everyone knew if the United States didn’t make a serious commitment, Paris wouldn’t happen. It’s now an open question how the rest of the world is going to respond if the United States eliminates a linchpin of its commitment.”

Trump will also aim to wipe out Obama’s climate action plan, the 2013 directive outlining the government’s response to climate change. His orders will lift a 14-month-old moratorium on new coal leases on federal lands, while a major hydraulic fracturing (fracking) regulation will be reviewed.

Guidelines published by the White House Council on Environmental Quality last August will be rescinded. Estimates of the social costs of carbon and other greenhouses gases will be overturned because they were not put out in “a transparent fashion”, the White House official said.

Aides insisted the official speak without being named, despite Trump’s past criticism of the use of unnamed sources. The official said the measures were aimed at achieving the goal of energy independence. “We want to take our own course and do it in our own fashion.”

Climate change is “an issue that deserves attention but again I think the president’s been very clear he’s not going to pursue a climate or environmental policies that put the US economy at risk”, he said. “It’s very simple.”

Trump and his allies, including Scott Pruitt of the Environmental Protection Agency, have previously criticised the 2016 Paris climate accord involving nearly 200 countries. The official said on Monday: “In terms of the Paris agreement, whether we stay in or not is still under discussion.”

Asked what message he wanted to send to major carbon producers such as China and India, the official said: “I think the United States is going to pursue its interests as it sees fit. I think the president’s been very clear about having an America-first energy policy. We have a lot of energy in this country and the president wants to continue to remove any obstacles so we can produce.”

The official was pressed by reporters on how climate change should be tackled. He said: “One, you’ve got to make sure you have a strong economy. You’ve got to make sure you have people who are actually working. To the extent that the economy is strong and growing and in prosperity, that’s the best way to protect the environment.”

He said natural gas, clean coal, nuclear and renewables were part of the mix but added: “Look globally. The more prosperous the economies … if you compare the United States to other economies, we have a cleaner, healthier environment than other countries that don’t. I mean, look at China.”

The official insisted: “The previous administration devalued workers by their policies. We’re saying we can do both: we can protect the environment and provide people with work and keep the economy going and that’s the policy agenda we’re going to focus on.”

The 2015 clean power plan has been on hold since 2016 while a federal appeals court considers a challenge by coal-friendly states and more than 100 companies. The attempt to roll it back completely will meet with fierce opposition.

Tomás Carbonell, director of regulatory policy and senior attorney at the Environmental Defense Fund, said the White House must adhere to the same process of public notice and comment that was followed in adopting the plan, which took almost two years.

“Large majorities of Americans in red and blue states alike support strong action to reduce carbon pollution from the nation’s power plants, and the clean power plan is supported by a broad and diverse coalition of states, municipalities, power companies, leading businesses, consumer advocates, faith organizations and many others,” he said.

“These supporters will turn out in force to oppose the administration’s outrageous attack on the United States’ only nationwide limits on carbon pollution from power plants – safeguards that are essential to protecting our public health, securing a clean energy economy and yielding a safer climate for our children.”

Travis Nichols, a spokesman for Greenpeace, said: “This proposed executive order gives us further proof that Trump isn’t a leader, he’s just a fossil fuel industry stooge with a presidential pen. Thankfully, for all his bluster, the best Trump can do is delay America’s inevitable transition to clean energy, but he can’t stop it.

“The problem, of course, is how much devastation his administration will inflict on the climate, vulnerable communities and the environment in the meantime. With this proposed executive order the Trump administration is simply putting America further behind in the global race towards a renewable future.”

The American Sustainable Business Council said: “Businesses want action that addresses climate change. They know that rolling back the clean power plan without a meaningful alternative in its place, like a carbon fee, will make climate change worse. That will further hurt economic growth.

“The business community is looking for real leadership on climate change, and so far all we’ve seen are decisions from the polluters’ playbook.”

Megan Feight, 28, grew up surfing and now owns a business in Beaufort. She recalls seeing the aftermath of the 2010 BP oil spill while flying over the Gulf of Mexico in an airplane.

""Seeing something like that in person gives you sort of the same feelings that you see when you see photographs or videos of it — it's horrifying and real,"" she says.

Even without an oil spill, some researchers worry that noise from seismic air guns may confuse marine animals that depend on sound for navigation.

Industry leaders like Richie Miller say they follow federal rules meant to protect wildlife. He's the president of Spectrum Geo, an oil and gas survey firm based in Houston that's applying to conduct some of the seismic tests.

""There are what we call PSOs, protected species observers, on the vessels, and they're there solely to look for marine mammals. And if they get within a certain safety zone, then the vessels shut down,"" he says.

As regulators consider requests from companies like Miller's, the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is hosting public meetings up and down the coast to discuss both offshore drilling and seismic testing.

""This has been piquing a lot of interest,"" says John Filostrat, a spokesman for the agency.

""Seismic acquisition hasn't been conducted on the Atlantic for three decades, and so we really don't have up-to-date information on what's out there,"" he says.

What happens next is up to state and federal regulators. Coastal cities can only pass resolutions expressing opposition, without any force of law.

But Beaufort's mayor, Billy Keyserling, says these local efforts are important.

""I think that the more towns which do represent bundles of people that are involved in sending the message and educating the public, the more difficult it's gonna be,"" he says.

If the plans move ahead, ships carrying seismic air guns could start their search for oil as early as this year.",www.npr.org,center,XDNPFZAILWjClJ8F

Heating up: Climate change advocates try to silence Krauthammer

Charles Krauthammer says it right up front in his Washington Post column: “I’m not a global warming believer. I’m not a global warming denier.”

More On This...

He does, however, challenge the notion that the science on climate change is settled and says those who insist otherwise are engaged in “a crude attempt to silence critics and delegitimize debate.”

How ironic, then, that some environmental activists launched a petition urging the Post not to publish Krauthammer’s column on Friday.

Their response to opinions they disagree with is to suppress the speech.

Brad Johnson (@ClimateBrad), the editor of HillHeat.com and a former Think Progress staffer, boasted on Twitter that 110,000 people had urged the newspaper “to stop publishing climate lies” like the Krauthammer piece.

I understand that many people are passionate about global warming and consider skeptics to be flat-earthers. Those who don’t like the arguments by Krauthammer, a Fox News contributor, should by all means criticize, dispute, denounce and otherwise go at him. That’s how debate takes place in a country with a vibrant media culture.

Instead, these folks believe that censorship is preferable. Why engage Krauthammer when they might just be able to employ pressure tactics to silence him? And what’s the difference between this and shouting down a speaker at a town hall?

Krauthammer told me the petition-signers “showed up just in time to make precisely the point I made in the column.”

When it comes to free speech, he says, “they don’t even hide it anymore. Now they proudly want certain arguments banished from discourse. The next step is book burning. So the question of the day is: Can you light a Kindle?

“Is there anything more anti-scientific than scientific truths being determined by petition and demonstration?”

Maybe this reflects a broader trend in which people want to wall themselves off from contrary information — and wall off others as well. Debating a complicated subject like climate change — and, equally important, what to do about it — is difficult. Attempting to silence the other side is the easy way out.

Of course, most climate-change proponents are perfectly willing to argue their case on the merits. Unfortunately, that doesn’t apply to everyone.

Costas vs. Putin

Since NBC Sports has taken some heat for its treatment of Russia during the Sochi Olympics, it’s only fair to note that Bob Costas said this during prime time:

“While in many significant ways, Russians have better lives than Soviet citizens of a generation ago, their’s is still a government which imprisons dissidents, is hostile to gay rights, sponsors and supports a vicious regime in Syria, and that’s just a partial list.”

A partial list indeed.

Heavy-handed New York Times?

It often pops up when you read the New York Times website: “Recommended for You.”

I don’t really need the Times to steer me to certain pieces, but some people find this absurd. As Public Editor Margaret Sullivan writes:

“One, Patti Reid, wrote, ‘I find this offensive and ridiculous, since I feel competent to choose articles to read on my own.’ Others express privacy concerns – they don’t want their preferences tracked; and others protest the commercial applications that allow advertisers to present ads tailored to readers’ apparent preferences.

In theory , the solution should be simple : We need to stop overusing antibiotics . Yet nearly every attempt to do so thus far has failed .
Now California is taking drastic measures . This weekend , Gov . Jerry Brown signed the toughest restrictions yet on antibiotic use in the United States , banning the state 's livestock producers from using certain antibiotics for routine disease prevention and growth promotion .
`` The science is clear that the overuse of antibiotics in livestock has contributed to the spread of antibiotic resistance and the undermining of decades of lifesaving advances in medicine , '' Brown said in a statement .
This is , potentially , a huge deal . Across the United States , more than 70 percent of medically important antibiotics are sold for use in animals , so curbing overuse in this area has always been a priority for public health reformers . And California 's new law could push other states to follow suit .
The science behind drug resistance is straightforward enough . The more we use antibiotics to kill off disease-causing bacteria , the more likely those bacteria are to evolve resistance , developing random mutations to outwit our drugs . And overuse has become a huge problem . In the United States alone , antibiotic-resistant infections are now associated with 23,000 deaths and 2 million illnesses every year . By 2050 , a report out of the UK suggested drug-resistant infections will kill more people than cancer .
So public health experts have been looking for places to curtail misuse . It would help , for instance , if doctors stopped prescribing unnecessary antibiotics . But another key place to look is on farms , where the vast majority of medically important antibiotics are sold .
Antibiotics on farms are typically used in three ways : to treat sick animals , to prevent infections , and to fatten up animals . The first use is uncontroversial : Everyone agrees that it 's okay to use antibiotics to treat animals that come down with disease . But public health experts have criticized the latter two uses . They argue that many livestock producers needlessly overuse antibiotics to prevent infections and promote growth — essentially relying on them as an alternative to hygiene and good nutrition . These are considered `` nontherapeutic '' uses .
And experts argue this overuse has real consequences . Both the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have told Congress that there 's a link between the routine , nontherapeutic use of antibiotics on farms and the superbug crisis in humans .
So far , however , policymakers have struggled to solve the issue . Farmers and ranchers have resisted broad restrictions on antibiotic use . After all , they say , it 's not always easy to distinguish between therapeutic and nontherapeutic uses . What if you have 1,000 chickens and 100 get sick ? Is it okay to give drugs to all of them ? A blanket ban might miss some important nuances . These groups ( along with agricultural and pharmaceutical lobbying groups ) also argue that any restrictions could raise costs for livestock producers .
The federal government has also struggled with this issue . Last year , the FDA set rules that asked livestock producers to voluntarily phase out the use of antibiotics to boost animal growth ( a practice that has been dwindling anyway ) . But the FDA did n't place any restrictions on using antibiotics for disease prevention , which critics argued was a huge loophole . What 's more , the FDA rules added little oversight in how the drugs were used day to day .
Now California is stepping in . The California bill , which was drafted by Sen. Jerry Hill , is designed to fill in some of these regulatory gaps and further reduce the use of certain antibiotics on farms .
Effective January 1 2018 , SB 27 requires livestock producers to get prescriptions for any medically important antibiotics ( i.e. , those used by humans ) that they want to give to livestock . That means it 'll be more difficult for farmers to buy these drugs over the counter — which is where they get most of their drugs right now . So this provision is meant to add some oversight .
The law also bans livestock producers from using antibiotics to promote growth or for ambiguous `` prevention '' purposes . The idea is that veterinarians would only write prescriptions for antibiotics if they were used specifically to treat sick animals or prevent a disease where there 's a clear risk . So if , say , a rancher had hundreds of cattle and a few came down with an infection , he 'd be able to give antibiotics to the rest as a preventive measure if the vet thought that made sense . But he could n't give them daily antibiotics `` just in case , '' as a matter of routine .
The California law also establishes an antibiotic stewardship program and requires the state Department of Food and Agriculture to bolster oversight by creating a tracking system on antibiotic usage and resistance .
California is one of the nation 's top producers of livestock , so the law will have a major immediate impact . But it could also have a ripple effect elsewhere , since a number of other states are considering similar legislation . Crucially , California could demonstrate that responsible antibiotic use , guided by veterinarians , is a workable middle ground on the prevention question .
According to Bloomberg , only seven lawmakers voted against the bill and industry associations in the state did n't put up much of a fight . `` I think the bill is basically doing something that we in California have been doing all along , which is phasing out antibiotic use , '' Bill Mattos , president of the California Poultry Federation , told Bloomberg . `` It 's something that the industry is living with . ''
Perhaps the most immediate impact of SB 27 would be drawing more attention to the problem of antibiotic resistance . The state law is part of a trend toward cutting back on antibiotics in response to consumer concern . In April , Tyson Foods — the biggest chicken seller in the US — announced plans to eliminate the use of human antibiotics in its flocks by 2017 . The pledge came two months after McDonald 's announced that within two years it will stop buying chicken that has been reared on antibiotics meant for humans .
Rep. Louise Slaughter ( D-NY ) , the only microbiologist in Congress , applauded the bill . `` This bill will make real change in agricultural antibiotic use and curb the growth in antibiotic resistance that threatens the health of our country , '' she wrote in a letter to Gov . Brown .
Avinash Kar , a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council ’ s Health Program , called SB 27 a `` game changer '' : `` By reining in the misuse of these miracle drugs , it helps ensure that life-saving antibiotics will be effective when we need them most .

Why curbing antibiotic use on farms is so controversial

The science behind drug resistance is straightforward enough. The more we use antibiotics to kill off disease-causing bacteria, the more likely those bacteria are to evolve resistance, developing random mutations to outwit our drugs. And overuse has become a huge problem. In the United States alone, antibiotic-resistant infections are now associated with 23,000 deaths and 2 million illnesses every year. By 2050, a report out of the UK suggested drug-resistant infections will kill more people than cancer.

So public health experts have been looking for places to curtail misuse. It would help, for instance, if doctors stopped prescribing unnecessary antibiotics. But another key place to look is on farms, where the vast majority of medically important antibiotics are sold.

Antibiotics on farms are typically used in three ways: to treat sick animals, to prevent infections, and to fatten up animals. The first use is uncontroversial: Everyone agrees that it's okay to use antibiotics to treat animals that come down with disease. But public health experts have criticized the latter two uses. They argue that many livestock producers needlessly overuse antibiotics to prevent infections and promote growth — essentially relying on them as an alternative to hygiene and good nutrition. These are considered ""nontherapeutic"" uses.

And experts argue this overuse has real consequences. Both the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have told Congress that there's a link between the routine, nontherapeutic use of antibiotics on farms and the superbug crisis in humans.

But the FDA didn't place any restrictions on using antibiotics for disease prevention, which critics argued was a huge loophole. What's more, the FDA rules added little oversight in how the drugs were used day to day.

California passed the nation's strictest law on antibiotic use

Now California is stepping in. The California bill, which was drafted by Sen. Jerry Hill, is designed to fill in some of these regulatory gaps and further reduce the use of certain antibiotics on farms.

Effective January 1 2018, SB 27 requires livestock producers to get prescriptions for any medically important antibiotics (i.e., those used by humans) that they want to give to livestock.

But he couldn't give them daily antibiotics ""just in case,"" as a matter of routine.

The California law also establishes an antibiotic stewardship program and requires the state Department of Food and Agriculture to bolster oversight by creating a tracking system on antibiotic usage and resistance.

California's antibiotic approach could spread to other states

California is one of the nation's top producers of livestock, so the law will have a major immediate impact. But it could also have a ripple effect elsewhere, since a number of other states are considering similar legislation. Crucially, California could demonstrate that responsible antibiotic use, guided by veterinarians, is a workable middle ground on the prevention question.

According to Bloomberg, only seven lawmakers voted against the bill and industry associations in the state didn't put up much of a fight.

Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Princeton University, told The New York Times that Trump’s order signals that the U.S. will fall short of its pledge to cut emissions of about 26 percent by 2025. He said Trump’s order “sends a signal to other countries that they might not have to meet their commitments—which would mean that the world would fail to stay out of the climate danger zone.”

Declining oil prices may be slowing the U.S. shale boom. But there's no denying that the nation will remain a leading global producer of oil and natural gas well into the future, thanks to advances in drilling technology.

So, what's next when it comes to big breakthroughs in U.S. energy supply?

The Scotland-based consultancy Wood Mackenzie sees solar energy as the best candidate now for such change.

In a new study called ""Is Solar the Next Shale?"", Wood Mackenzie says steep reductions in the costs of making solar modules put that technology in a strong position to compete with other forms of electric power in many parts of the U.S.

Climate change is here and will only worsen . Get used to more flooding , wildfires and drought , depending on where you live . Cities and states across America already are spending lots of money to respond .
Those are the take-home messages of a new White House report released Tuesday that is part of President Barack Obama 's second-term effort to prepare the nation for the impacts of a changing climate such as rising sea levels and increasingly erratic weather .
The National Climate Assessment update said evidence of human-made climate change `` continues to strengthen '' and that `` Americans are noticing changes all around them . ''
`` This is not some distant problem of the future , '' Obama told NBC , while John Holdren , who directs the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy , said climate change `` already is affecting every region of the country and key sectors of the economy . ''
The Obama administration wants the report to ignite awareness of the need for government and communities to respond now to climate change in the face of fierce political opposition , mostly from conservatives .
A relentless campaign backed by the fossil fuel industry and its allies challenges whether climate change is real , and if so , whether human activity such as increased carbon emissions from power plants , factories and cars contributes to it .

In a statement coinciding with the report 's publication , the White House said the findings `` underscore the need for urgent action to combat the threats from climate change , protect American citizens and communities today , and build a sustainable future for our kids and grandkids . ''
John Podesta , a Democratic operative who now counsels the President , told reporters that Obama will kick off a broad campaign this week to publicize the report , while Cabinet members and other administration officials would be `` fanning out '' across the country to spread the word about how climate change impacts specific regions .
Republican critics immediately pounced on new report as a political tool for Obama to try to impose a regulatory agenda that would hurt the economy .
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky mocked what he described as the hypocritical stance of `` liberal elites '' who demand strong action on climate change while failing to reduce their own carbon footprint .
`` Even if we were to enact the kind of national energy regulations the President seems to want so badly , it would be unlikely to meaningfully impact global emissions anyway unless other major industrial nations do the same thing , '' McConnell said in arguing against proposals to reduce industrial pollution .
He called the debate `` cynical '' because Obama knew that `` much of the pain of imposing such regulations would be borne by our own middle class . ''
To Podesta and Holdren , the reality of climate change will win out over opponents of new energy policies to combat it .
`` Public awareness has been going up and will continue to go up , '' Holdren told reporters , predicting increased public support for government action to reduce U.S. carbon emissions and for America to take a leadership role on climate change in the international arena .
Recent polling indicates most Americans believe human activities cause climate change , but also shows the issue is less important to the public than the economy and other topics .
A Gallup poll in March found that 34 % of respondents think climate change , called global warming in the poll , posed a `` serious threat '' to their way of life , compared to 64 % who responded `` no . '' At the same time , more than 60 % of respondents believed global warming was happening or would happen in their lifetime .
More than 300 experts helped produce the report over several years , updating a previous assessment published in 2009 . Podesta called it `` actionable science '' for policymakers and the public to use in forging a way forward .
Scientists categorize the response to climate change into two strategies -- minimizing the effects by reducing the cause , which is known as mitigation , and preparing for impacts already occurring or certain to occur , which is called adaptation .
The report breaks the country down by region and identifies specific threats should climate change continue . Major concerns cited by scientists involved in creating the report include rising sea levels along America 's coasts , drought in the Southwest and prolonged fire seasons .
It predicts sea levels will rise at least a foot by the end of the century and perhaps as much as four feet , depending on how much of the Greenland and Antarctic ice shelf melts .

Such an outcome could be catastrophic for millions of people living along the ocean , submerging tropical islands and encroaching on coastal areas .
Low-lying U.S. cities already experience high flooding , with Miami planning to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to address the problem , noted Jerry Melillo of Marine Biological Laboratory , who chaired the advisory committee that produced the new assessment .
The Great Plains could experience heavier droughts and heat waves with increasing frequency , while more wildfires in the West could threaten agriculture and residential communities , the report notes .
Obama 's week-long focus on climate change continues Wednesday , when the White House convenes a summit focused on green building tactics . Later in the week , Obama will announce new solar power initiatives , according to Podesta .
In his first term , the President faced opposition by Republicans and some Democrats from states with major fossil fuel industries such as coal production to significant climate change legislation .
He pledged to renew his efforts on the issue in his final four years , including using executive actions that bypass Congress . Obama has introduced new regulations on vehicle emissions and created `` climate hubs '' that help businesses prepare for the effects of climate change .
A major upcoming issue is a proposal under consideration by the Obama administration to build the Keystone XL pipeline , which would transport tar sands oil from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico .
Environmental groups say the project would contribute to climate change because tar sands oil is dirtier than conventionally drilled crude , and importing it would maintain the country 's dependence on fossil fuels . Republicans and some Democrats from oil industry states want the pipeline approved to create jobs and bolster exports from a strategic ally and U.S. neighbor .
The new assessment calls for continued mitigation steps including regulations and programs to reduce carbon emissions , as well as necessary planning and investment to deal with the known impacts .
Melillo cited some adaptation measures already underway , noting a `` terrific plan for extreme heat events '' by the city of Philadelphia .
`` Things are starting to happen , '' Melillo said , adding that the continued efforts over time will `` ultimately present a very positive picture '' about Americans taking action on climate change .","Story highlights President Obama says climate change happening now

""This is not some distant problem of the future,"" Obama told NBC, while John Holdren, who directs the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said climate change ""already is affecting every region of the country and key sectors of the economy.""

The Obama administration wants the report to ignite awareness of the need for government and communities to respond now to climate change in the face of fierce political opposition, mostly from conservatives.

Unrelenting political opposition

A relentless campaign backed by the fossil fuel industry and its allies challenges whether climate change is real, and if so, whether human activity such as increased carbon emissions from power plants, factories and cars contributes to it.

In a statement coinciding with the report's publication, the White House said the findings ""underscore the need for urgent action to combat the threats from climate change, protect American citizens and communities today, and build a sustainable future for our kids and grandkids.""

John Podesta, a Democratic operative who now counsels the President, told reporters that Obama will kick off a broad campaign this week to publicize the report, while Cabinet members and other administration officials would be ""fanning out"" across the country to spread the word about how climate change impacts specific regions.

Republican critics immediately pounced on new report as a political tool for Obama to try to impose a regulatory agenda that would hurt the economy.

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky mocked what he described as the hypocritical stance of ""liberal elites"" who demand strong action on climate change while failing to reduce their own carbon footprint.

""Even if we were to enact the kind of national energy regulations the President seems to want so badly, it would be unlikely to meaningfully impact global emissions anyway unless other major industrial nations do the same thing,"" McConnell said in arguing against proposals to reduce industrial pollution.

He called the debate ""cynical"" because Obama knew that ""much of the pain of imposing such regulations would be borne by our own middle class.""

Changing attitudes?

To Podesta and Holdren, the reality of climate change will win out over opponents of new energy policies to combat it.

""Public awareness has been going up and will continue to go up,"" Holdren told reporters, predicting increased public support for government action to reduce U.S. carbon emissions and for America to take a leadership role on climate change in the international arena.

Recent polling indicates most Americans believe human activities cause climate change, but also shows the issue is less important to the public than the economy and other topics.

A Gallup poll in March found that 34% of respondents think climate change, called global warming in the poll, posed a ""serious threat"" to their way of life, compared to 64% who responded ""no."" At the same time, more than 60% of respondents believed global warming was happening or would happen in their lifetime.

More than 300 experts helped produce the report over several years, updating a previous assessment published in 2009. Podesta called it ""actionable science"" for policymakers and the public to use in forging a way forward.

Scientists categorize the response to climate change into two strategies -- minimizing the effects by reducing the cause, which is known as mitigation, and preparing for impacts already occurring or certain to occur, which is called adaptation.

The report breaks the country down by region and identifies specific threats should climate change continue. Major concerns cited by scientists involved in creating the report include rising sea levels along America's coasts, drought in the Southwest and prolonged fire seasons.

Sea levels rising

It predicts sea levels will rise at least a foot by the end of the century and perhaps as much as four feet, depending on how much of the Greenland and Antarctic ice shelf melts.

Such an outcome could be catastrophic for millions of people living along the ocean, submerging tropical islands and encroaching on coastal areas.

Low-lying U.S. cities already experience high flooding, with Miami planning to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to address the problem, noted Jerry Melillo of Marine Biological Laboratory, who chaired the advisory committee that produced the new assessment.

The Great Plains could experience heavier droughts and heat waves with increasing frequency, while more wildfires in the West could threaten agriculture and residential communities, the report notes.

Obama's week-long focus on climate change continues Wednesday, when the White House convenes a summit focused on green building tactics. Later in the week, Obama will announce new solar power initiatives, according to Podesta.

In his first term, the President faced opposition by Republicans and some Democrats from states with major fossil fuel industries such as coal production to significant climate change legislation.

He pledged to renew his efforts on the issue in his final four years, including using executive actions that bypass Congress. Obama has introduced new regulations on vehicle emissions and created ""climate hubs"" that help businesses prepare for the effects of climate change.

A major upcoming issue is a proposal under consideration by the Obama administration to build the Keystone XL pipeline, which would transport tar sands oil from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.

Environmental groups say the project would contribute to climate change because tar sands oil is dirtier than conventionally drilled crude, and importing it would maintain the country's dependence on fossil fuels. Republicans and some Democrats from oil industry states want the pipeline approved to create jobs and bolster exports from a strategic ally and U.S. neighbor.

The new assessment calls for continued mitigation steps including regulations and programs to reduce carbon emissions, as well as necessary planning and investment to deal with the known impacts.

Melillo cited some adaptation measures already underway, noting a ""terrific plan for extreme heat events"" by the city of Philadelphia.

""Things are starting to happen,"" Melillo said, adding that the continued efforts over time will ""ultimately present a very positive picture"" about Americans taking action on climate change.",www.cnn.com,left,v8w9Q71e5zIQmamK

Purdum,"LOS ANGELES — For much of the century since William Mulholland , the visionary or villainous engineer who brought water from the Eastern Sierra to Los Angeles , opened the floodgates of his aqueduct and declared , “ There it is . Take it ! ” Californians have done just that — and most of the time their political leaders haven ’ t had to worry too much about the result .
But in the fourth year of the Golden State ’ s epic drought , the water shortage is having real consequences , not only for the everyday lives of residents , but for the policies and political fortunes of their elected officials as well . A crisis that is estimated to have cost the state ’ s economy more than $ 2 billion last year alone has upended an unsustainable status quo and raised uncomfortable questions for politicians from Gov . Jerry Brown to local mayors .
Brown ’ s executive order last month ordering mandatory reductions averaging 25 percent for water use in urban areas was widely praised , if almost certainly overdue . But the governor has also been faulted for not asking for comparable conservation from the state ’ s vast agribusiness industry , which requires a gallon of water to produce a single almond , more than 20 gallons to grow an ounce of asparagus and more than 100 gallons to raise an ounce of beef . ( In fairness , growers have already had water supplies cut — in some cases sharply — by longstanding rules and market forces . )
For her part , Dianne Feinstein , the state ’ s senior Democratic senator , has struggled to reconcile the views of liberal environmental groups with her longstanding support for growers in the Central Valley , including her billionaire Beverly Hills campaign contributors Stewart and Lynda Resnick , makers of POM Wonderful pomegranate juice and the state ’ s largest producers of almonds and pistachios , lucrative orchard crops that can ’ t be fallowed to save water in dry years .
Conservatives like Rep. Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield , the House majority leader , have seized on the drought to call for relaxation of the Endangered Species Act and other environmental laws that he contends keep California from more fully exploiting its biggest in-state source of water , the sprawling Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta . Carly Fiorina , the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard and GOP presidential hopeful , has repeatedly called the drought the “ man-made ” result of excessive environmental regulation — a claim that The Washington Post ’ s “ Fact Checker ” awarded “ Two Pinocchios ” for oversimplification .
And Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles has twice ripped up the front lawn of Getty House , his official residence in the Windsor Square neighborhood , to plant a low-water garden of flowering yarrow plants , even as LA Weekly , the city ’ s leading alternative newspaper , was reporting last fall that his house had been using 2,100 gallons of water a day — more than five times as much as the average local home .
“ Politicians are paying attention , because some people — mainly the media and interest groups — are paying attention , ” said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe , a professor of public policy at the University of Southern California . “ But I ’ m not at all sure it ’ s really hitting home yet with the average voter . When they start to see rate increases , and fines for overuse , and brown lawns , then they will be paying a lot of attention . I think the politicians are smart to be trying to get ahead of it , because this is the new normal . We are a desert , and we should have remained a desert . ”
Indeed , as long ago as 1947 , when Evelyn Waugh published “ Death in Hollywood , ” an essay about Forest Lawn Cemetery , in Life magazine , he predicted that when archaeologists of a future era descended on Los Angeles they would find “ much the same scene as confronted the Franciscan missionaries . ”
“ A dry landscape will extend from the ocean to the mountains , ” he wrote . “ Bel Air and Beverly Hills will lie naked save for scrub and cactus , all their flimsy multitude of architectural styles turned long ago to dust , while the horned toad and the turkey buzzard leave their faint imprint on the dunes that will drift on Sunset Boulevard . ”
Conditions here are not that bad — yet . But it is hard not to believe that California is in the midst of yet another radical transformation in its existence , one that ’ s likely to affect the state for decades to come and force a long-lasting reallocation of resources , heightening longstanding tensions between north and south , environmentalists and businesses , farmers and fishermen , and residential and commercial water customers .
Artificial turf companies have sprung up like crabgrass — some of them just as disreputable — spurred by promised consumer rebates of $ 2 to $ 3 a square foot from local water districts to customers who tear out their old water-hogging lawns . Here , too , the rewards and benefits are not necessarily being shared equally . For example , about 60 percent of the money set aside for rebates by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California — a consortium of cities and districts that provides water to about 17 million people — has been reserved for commercial users , while 90 percent of the requests for turf removal subsidies have come from residential customers .
California ’ s water supply has long been controlled by a complex network of federal , state and local authorities . Washington has a powerful role , not only because of environmental laws but also because of its major investment in dams and aqueducts , including Hoover Dam and the Colorado River system , and the massive Central Valley Project , which transports water from the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers to the state ’ s agricultural heartland .
Feinstein ’ s behind-the-scenes attempt to broker a bipartisan bill that would allow temporary flexibility to supply additional water to both urban and rural areas from the delta after big rains , rather than diverting into the ocean , foundered in Congress late last year . Her efforts raised alarm among some environmentalists , who worried that she would bow to agricultural interests , something a longtime adviser told ███ “ she has no intention of doing. ” Feinstein resumed her work on a bill in the current Congress , and while her spokesman declined to offer a timetable for its unveiling , she is almost certainly serving her last term and could presumably spend the political capital needed to craft a complex compromise .
Last December , the Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill backed by McCarthy and others to authorize temporary measures to maximize water flows from the delta during the drought , even if they exceed certain requirements set by the Endangered Species Act to protect smelt and salmon . The bill was opposed in the Senate by Feinstein and her California colleague , Barbara Boxer , and the Obama administration threatened a veto on the grounds that it contained conflicting mandates and would lead to litigation and uncertainty . But the drive for a temporary easing of the rules is not going away with the GOP now in control of both houses .
“ There ’ s been pressure on the part of the constituencies in the San Joaquin Valley to ease up on the Endangered Species Act , ” said Ellen Hanak , director of the Water Policy Center at the Public Policy Institute of California . “ An exemption doesn ’ t mean overhauling the act as a whole , and therefore it ’ s more possible it would happen . ”
Brown also opposed the GOP bill , but he himself was forced last week to scale back the size of the fish and wildlife habitat — to 30,000 acres from more than 100,000 — that he proposes to restore in the delta via construction of two giant water tunnels .
Meantime , not all Californians are suffering equally . Some enclaves in the Central Valley are almost completely without water , having to truck in supplies for showers and cooking , while lush municipalities like Beverly Hills continue to use more than their share and would face reductions of 36 percent under Brown ’ s recent order . It will be up to local water authorities to decide how to enforce the cutbacks , through higher rates or fines and penalties for overuse . Brown imposed the mandatory reductions because earlier efforts at voluntary conservation had not produced the needed results , but the evidence so far suggests that hitting his targets will not be easy .
The State Water Resources Control Board reported this week that cumulative water savings since last summer have totaled just under 9 percent , while most of the state ’ s water suppliers issued only a handful of waste notices in March , despite receiving thousands of complaints .
Since 1928 , the California State Constitution has had an amendment requiring that all water use in the state be “ reasonable and beneficial , ” but that has long meant different things to different constituencies . Water rights are complex , and those with so-called “ senior rights ” get supplies first . In normal years , such users might be expected to sell their reserves to needy growers down the food chain , but now they themselves are experiencing such shortages that they have none left to sell , with the result that some citrus growers are plowing under trees that will take years to replace , simply because they can ’ t buy water at a price that makes economic sense .

Environmentalists have long believed that farmers get too much water . Indeed , agriculture in California accounts for 80 percent of all water use by humans ( 40 percent of total water use , including environmental ) while accounting for just 2 percent of gross state product ( down from about 5 percent in the 1960s ) .

PARIS — President Barack Obama urged the world to consider the climate talks that kicked off here Monday as potentially the last chance to make a meaningful impact on combating climate change .
What the world needs to agree on , Obama told the 150-odd other world leaders gathered in Paris for the two-week conference , is “ not a stopgap solution , but a long-term strategy that gives the world confidence in a low-carbon future . ”
Obama quoted Martin Luther King Jr. , saying , “ There is such a thing as being too late . ”
“ When it comes to climate change , that hour is almost upon us . But if we act here , now , if we place our short-term interests behind the air that our children will breathe and the water our children will drink , ” Obama said , “ then we will not be too late for them . ”
Obama noted the backdrop of the Nov. 13 terror attacks , casting a climate agreement as a rebuke to the terrorists , much as he did in speaking at his news conference with French President François Hollande at the White House last week .
`` We salute the people of Paris for insisting this crucial conference go on , '' Obama said , calling it `` an act of defiance that proves nothing will deter us from building the future we want for our children . ''
`` Through our presence here today , we show that we are stronger than the terrorists , '' German Chancellor Angela Merkel echoed in her own remarks .
The summit , housed in a conference center in the suburbs of the French capital , will be seeking a collective , nonbinding agreement among nations setting their own plans to cut carbon emissions , largely through switching to renewable energy production over fossil fuels . The burden falls differently on countries at various stages of development : The United States and China , the two largest carbon emitters , are pledging to cut their own production and increase clean-up efforts , while developing countries worry that they will be left behind by restrictions that keep them from ever reaching that level of industrialization .
Obama addressed this imbalance directly , warning that all would suffer if the planet continues to grow warmer at its current pace , but that smaller economies could suffer most from drought , famine and other environmental impacts .
A future of rising seas and temperatures , Obama said , “ is not one of strong economies , nor is it one where fragile states can find their footing . That future is one that we have the power to change , right here , right now . But only if we rise to this moment . ”
Since the agreement being sought is nonbinding , it wouldn ’ t require congressional authorization if it comes through . Back home , there does seem to be a growing sense of the threat posed by climate change , with two-thirds of people calling it a serious threat in a new ABC News poll out Monday morning — but the sense of what to do about it isn ’ t falling where Obama would like : Just 43 percent of people believe most scientists agree on the causes ( the number within the scientific community is close to 99 percent agreement about humans causing the changes ) , and only 47 percent say the federal government should do more than it is doing now to try to deal with global warming , down from a high of 70 percent under the Bush administration eight years ago .
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump reflected those sentiments in an interview on MSNBC 's “ Morning Joe ” on Monday morning , calling Obama ’ s warning of global warming as a top threat “ one of the dumbest statements I ’ ve ever heard in politics . ”
“ When we have large groups of people that want to blow up every one of our cities , that want to destroy our country , that want to kill our people , and he ’ s worried about global warming , ” Trump said . “ I think it ’ s one of the dumbest things I ’ ve ever seen , or perhaps most naive . ”
“ Tackling climate change is a shared mission for mankind . All eyes are now on Paris , ” said Chinese President Xi Jinping , speaking shortly after Obama . Xi called for countries to determine their own best solutions and for an agreement that includes “ global sustainable development at a high level and bring about new international cooperation featuring win-wins . ”
Obama and Xi held a bilateral meeting before the speeches to reiterate their commitment to climate cooperation , as well as picking up on the cyber-hacking agreements they made during Xi ’ s visit to Washington in September , denuclearizing the Korean peninsula and fulfilling the commitments of the P5+1 agreement on Iran ’ s nuclear program .
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi called the conference “ crucial , ” saying he hopes it “ proves to be a turning point … [ in ] reaching an ambitious , sustainable and international agreement to face climate change . ”
“ We know how large the phenomenon is , and we know how disastrous climate change can be for humanity , ” Chilean President Michelle Bachelet said .
Unlike during the 2009 climate talks in Copenhagen , which collapsed without an agreement , this year ’ s conference front-loaded the speeches from leaders in an attempt to have them urge progress rather than try to head off another failure .
Obama took to that approach , putting an agreement in his well-worn frame of choosing hope over cynicism .
“ Here in Paris , we can show the world what ’ s possible when we come together united by common effort and with a common purpose , ” Obama said . “ The next generation is watching what we do . ”","poster=""https://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201511/658/1155968404_4637971810001_4637842525001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" President Obama, after offering condolences and praise for Paris, strikes a hopeful note upon the opening of global climate talks there.

Obama quoted Martin Luther King Jr., saying, “There is such a thing as being too late.”

“When it comes to climate change, that hour is almost upon us. But if we act here, now, if we place our short-term interests behind the air that our children will breathe and the water our children will drink,” Obama said, “then we will not be too late for them.”

Obama noted the backdrop of the Nov. 13 terror attacks, casting a climate agreement as a rebuke to the terrorists, much as he did in speaking at his news conference with French President François Hollande at the White House last week.

""We salute the people of Paris for insisting this crucial conference go on,"" Obama said, calling it ""an act of defiance that proves nothing will deter us from building the future we want for our children.""

""Through our presence here today, we show that we are stronger than the terrorists,"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel echoed in her own remarks.

The summit, housed in a conference center in the suburbs of the French capital, will be seeking a collective, nonbinding agreement among nations setting their own plans to cut carbon emissions, largely through switching to renewable energy production over fossil fuels. The burden falls differently on countries at various stages of development: The United States and China, the two largest carbon emitters, are pledging to cut their own production and increase clean-up efforts, while developing countries worry that they will be left behind by restrictions that keep them from ever reaching that level of industrialization.

Back home, there does seem to be a growing sense of the threat posed by climate change, with two-thirds of people calling it a serious threat in a new ABC News poll out Monday morning — but the sense of what to do about it isn’t falling where Obama would like: Just 43 percent of people believe most scientists agree on the causes (the number within the scientific community is close to 99 percent agreement about humans causing the changes), and only 47 percent say the federal government should do more than it is doing now to try to deal with global warming, down from a high of 70 percent under the Bush administration eight years ago.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump reflected those sentiments in an interview on MSNBC's “Morning Joe” on Monday morning, calling Obama’s warning of global warming as a top threat “one of the dumbest statements I’ve ever heard in politics.”

“When we have large groups of people that want to blow up every one of our cities, that want to destroy our country, that want to kill our people, and he’s worried about global warming,” Trump said. “I think it’s one of the dumbest things I’ve ever seen, or perhaps most naive.”

“Tackling climate change is a shared mission for mankind. All eyes are now on Paris,” said Chinese President Xi Jinping, speaking shortly after Obama. Xi called for countries to determine their own best solutions and for an agreement that includes “global sustainable development at a high level and bring about new international cooperation featuring win-wins.”

Obama and Xi held a bilateral meeting before the speeches to reiterate their commitment to climate cooperation, as well as picking up on the cyber-hacking agreements they made during Xi’s visit to Washington in September, denuclearizing the Korean peninsula and fulfilling the commitments of the P5+1 agreement on Iran’s nuclear program.

World leaders echoed Obama’s call for action.

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi called the conference “crucial,” saying he hopes it “proves to be a turning point … [in] reaching an ambitious, sustainable and international agreement to face climate change.”

“We know how large the phenomenon is, and we know how disastrous climate change can be for humanity,” Chilean President Michelle Bachelet said.

Unlike during the 2009 climate talks in Copenhagen, which collapsed without an agreement, this year’s conference front-loaded the speeches from leaders in an attempt to have them urge progress rather than try to head off another failure.

Obama took to that approach, putting an agreement in his well-worn frame of choosing hope over cynicism.

“Here in Paris, we can show the world what’s possible when we come together united by common effort and with a common purpose,” Obama said. “The next generation is watching what we do.”

Climate models suggest we ’ ll also need to figure out how to pull some carbon dioxide back out of the atmosphere toward the end of the century if we want to stay below the agreed-upon 2°C warming limit . The UN 's most recent `` Emissions Gap '' report gives an illustration :
So how do we go `` carbon-negative '' ? Unfortunately , no one really knows for sure . We could plant more trees , but there 's only so much land to go around . We could deploy giant carbon-sucking fans , but that would be incredibly expensive and likely have limited effect .
Perhaps the most promising idea involves a technology called `` bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration . '' Basically , you harvest plants that are absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , burn them for electricity , and then capture the CO2 that ’ s emitted from those power plants and bury it underground . The result ? Negative emissions . To date , however , few people have studied this technology — or its limits — in detail .
That 's what makes this recent study in Nature Climate Change so fascinating . The authors , led by Daniel Sanchez of the University of California–Berkeley tried to model in detail how far western North America could actually go in deploying carbon-negative biomass plants . There are real limits : You can ’ t just cut down trees willy-nilly or you can actually make climate change worse .
In an optimistic case , power emissions fall 145 percent below 1990 levels by 2050
The good news ? Even a limited number of carbon-negative power plants could help reduce emissions drastically , they found . In a truly optimistic case — if combined with lots of wind and solar — western North America could have a power system in 2050 with emissions that are 145 percent below 1990 levels . That is , emissions do n't just fall to zero . The electricity system would actually remove carbon dioxide from the air .
The sober news is that this technology is still in its infancy , far from commercialization , and expected to be quite expensive . And it ca n't really substitute for other ways to cut emissions ; it 's more of a complement . But this modeling effort suggests the technology is worth pursuing further .
`` There are all these climate models telling us we have to go carbon negative by 2060 or so , '' Sanchez told me . `` But they don ’ t say much about how to get there — what power plants do you build ? Where do you build them ? How do you make it sustainable ? That ’ s what we tried to do here . ''
The basic concept of a `` bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration '' ( BECCS ) power plant is fairly straightforward .
Start with this idea : Trees and crops pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere as they grow . If we take those plants and burn them for fuel , that CO2 gets released back into the atmosphere . If , however , we replace those burned plants with new plants that also suck up CO2 , the whole thing is carbon-neutral , in theory . ( Yes , there are caveats here , we ’ ll get to them shortly . )
Now let ’ s go a step further : Say we took those plants and burned them to generate electricity . But we then captured all the CO2 that came out of the smokestack of our power plant and buried it underground , permanently . And we completely replaced those burned plants with new plants . On net , we ’ re actually removing CO2 from the atmosphere .
Notice that this is very similar to the concept of using carbon capture and storage for , say , coal or natural gas . Except CCS for coal or gas can only be carbon-neutral at best . CCS for plant matter can actually be carbon-negative .
There are lots of different ways to design a BECCS plant . We could use trees , crops , or leftover crop residue . There are also a variety of methods for capturing CO2 emissions from a power plant . We could scrub the CO2 out of the flue gas that comes up the smokestacks . Or we could gasify our fuel before it 's burned and remove the CO2 chemically .
Finally , we have to find an underground saline aquifer or depleted oil field that can hold the CO2 permanently .
One of the big problems with trying to use biomass as a clean energy source , however , is that it can be hard to do sustainably . That ’ s one of the big questions Sanchez ’ s study tried to figure out .
Say , for instance , we chop down a forest full of older trees and burn them for energy . We then plant a bunch of seedlings to replace them . That ’ s not perfectly carbon-neutral : the new trees are smaller than the trees we cut down , so they ’ re absorbing less CO2 , at least for their first few decades . We ’ ve just worsened global warming . Bad news .
Or let ’ s say we want to use plant residue — branches that have fallen on the forest floor , or the corncobs and stalks left over on farms in Iowa . Surely that ’ s all useless stuff that would have decayed and released its CO2 anyway , right ? Well , maybe not . Some of that residue might have helped soils absorb more carbon . So we have to be careful . ( Most research suggests only a fraction of the residue can be harvested sustainably . )
In their Nature Climate Change paper , Sanchez and his coauthors were careful to take into account research on sustainable practices . And that put real limits on things . They found that there was only enough sustainable biomass in the western United States to provide about 1.9 × 10^9 MMBtu of energy by 2050 .
To put that in perspective , that ’ s only enough to satisfy about 7 to 9 percent of projected electricity demand in western North America by 2050 . Not a ton . The good news , however , is that even a small number of plants could make a big difference .
At the moment , California has a goal of cutting emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 . Policymakers are hoping to do that with some mix of solar , wind , hydro , nuclear , and energy storage , plus perhaps gas plants that capture and bury their emissions .
In the Nature Climate Change paper , Sanchez found that the western US could go much , much further than that by simply adding a few carbon-negative biomass plants to the mix . In the most optimistic case , power plant emissions could fall 145 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 :
It all depends on what other energy sources are being used . So , for instance , if the west was still using lots of natural-gas plants in 2050 , it could build a few carbon-negative biomass plants and get an 86 percent reduction in emissions , compared with 1990 levels .
On the other hand , if the region was relying heavily on carbon-free renewables like wind and solar , then throwing these carbon-negative plants in the mix could lead to a point where the power sector , on the whole , is taking more CO2 out of the atmosphere than it ’ s putting back in .
One downside here is that this is all expensive — the authors estimate that BECCS plants would only start to become economically competitive in the western United States if we priced carbon dioxide at around $ 74 per ton . More drastic emissions cuts would require even higher costs .
To put that in perspective , that ’ s a fair bit more expensive than the cost of replanting additional forests ( between $ 5 and $ 40 per ton of CO2 ) . But it ’ s significantly cheaper than estimates of what it would take to filter carbon dioxide out of the air directly ( a whopping $ 1,000 per ton ) . That 's because it 's much easier to filter carbon dioxide out of , say , a smokestack , where it 's concentrated , than it is to take it out of the air — after it 's diffused into the atmosphere .
There are also technological hurdles to any carbon-capture and storage technology . Right now , there is only one power plant in North America that actually captures its own carbon dioxide and buries it underground — the Boundary Dam Carbon Capture Project in Saskatchewan , which opened in 2014 . ( Another coal CCS demonstration plant in Kemper , Mississippi , has faced delays and overruns , now costs $ 6.2 billion , has relied on federal government support , and wo n't open until mid-2016 at the earliest . )
This technology is still very much in its early stages , with much of the cost in figuring out how best to separate out the carbon dioxide in order to bury it . And apart from China , many governments are increasingly shying away from further R & D , scared off by the high costs .
`` The next step is tackling that commercialization question , '' Sanchez says . `` Right now , we don ’ t have commercial scale deployment . So how can we start building commercial scale plants ? What R & D do we need for better biomass gasifiers ? ''
There are also questions about what happens to the carbon dioxide once we pump it into old saline aquifers or depleted oil and gas fields . In theory , it should stay there permanently . But we need to be sure . Sanchez notes that even very small leakage rates would add up very quickly and would blunt the carbon benefit .
Even so , he notes , it ’ s a technology well worth researching —especially since pulling carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere is looking increasingly essential to stopping drastic global warming .

Yet in just a few years, the political debate over Keystone has exploded into an entire sector of the Washington influence economy. Funded by multibillion-dollar oil companies, labor unions and ultrarich environmentalists, the fight has filtered into every crack and crevice of the nation’s capital — all for a project some advocates on both sides privately concede wouldn’t be an environmental or economic game-changer.

Meet the ‘grass roots’

Besides bankrolling TV ads and hiring an army of lobbyists, advocates on both sides of the Keystone fight have spent millions mobilizing the public — or at least creating the illusion of mass mobilization.

On the pro-pipeline side, that has meant setting up an array of self-described “grass-roots” groups with generic-sounding names — the API-funded entities Energy Nation and Energy Citizens, for example — to build public support through social media, advertising and petitions.

Nebraskans for Jobs & Energy Independence is another such entity. It was set up ostensibly as a vehicle for native Nebraskans to channel their support for building the pipeline. But the group’s ties to national organizations lobbying for the pipeline’s approval are extensive.

API boasts a more than 23 million-person “grass-roots network” made up of individuals who have spoken or written on behalf of the industry, though it’s unclear how API arrived at that number. Groups such as Energy Citizens promote API talking points on their websites and tout testimonials that support the industry’s views on oil and gas. (Obama “needs to get off his hands on this issue,” wrote Joe B. from Colorado.)

Among the groups funded by API is Vets4Energy, which API says has 1,400 members (citing privacy concerns, the group declined to provide a member list) and has recruited veterans to press for the pipeline on Capitol Hill. Another is Oil Sands Fact Check, a group that aggressively rebuts assertions that the pipeline would cause environmental devastation. The latter group, run through the firm FTI Consulting, often sends representatives to anti-Keystone protests and emails reporters to highlight low attendance numbers.

Vets4Energy organized a recent pro-Keystone news conference with Nebraska Rep. Lee Terry and North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven. Both Republicans demanded action on the pipeline in front of a small handful of reporters — and a throng of Keystone-backing veterans associated with the group.

“The greatest generation conquered Nazi Germany in a little over four years,” Terry said. “But here we are, five years after the permits have been filed to build the Keystone XL pipeline, and we’re still waiting.”

Keystone foes with smaller budgets have nevertheless established national operations of comparable sophistication, often hiring brand-name Democratic firms to help. They have coordinated activities between national groups like the League of Conservation Voters and the Natural Resources Defense Council, and activist organizations like environmentalist Bill McKibben’s 350.org — often with the help of nationally known political consultants. McKibben’s group has paid thousands of dollars to the liberal PR firm FitzGibbon Media to amplify its message.

On its website, powerhouse Democratic firm Global Strategy Group touts its role in creating an umbrella coalition of anti-Keystone interests, dubbed All Risk, No Reward, which has held events and run television ads opposing the pipeline.

Acknowledging that “public opinion on [Keystone] is very mixed,” GSG’s online case study states: “GSG organized opportunities for experts to speak directly with top reporters and media outlets, planned and executed several high profile events, and earned top flight coverage in the nation’s most prominent print and broadcast media.”

Lower-profile groups have played an influential role in the pipeline fight: The progressive Bold Nebraska worked with state landowners to challenge Keystone’s intended route, while an eclectic collection of environmental and tribal groups calling itself the Cowboy and Indian Alliance gathered for an April protest on the National Mall — complete with teepees and horses.",www.politico.com,left,A9yVQqVdqlVkpkJ1

At least, that's what scientists reported at Argentina's Esperanza research station, on the very northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.

GENEVA ( AP ) — Human-caused climate change is dramatically degrading the Earth ’ s land and the way people use the land is making global warming worse , a new United Nations scientific report says . That creates a vicious cycle which is already making food more expensive , scarcer and less nutritious .
“ The cycle is accelerating , ” said NASA climate scientist Cynthia Rosenzweig , a co-author of the report . “ The threat of climate change affecting people ’ s food on their dinner table is increasing . ”
But if people change the way they eat , grow food and manage forests , it could help save the planet from a far warmer future , scientists said .
Earth ’ s land masses , which are only 30 % of the globe , are warming twice as fast as the planet as a whole . While heat-trapping gases are causing problems in the atmosphere , the land has been less talked about as part of climate change . A special report , written by more than 100 scientists and unanimously approved by diplomats from nations around the world Thursday at a meeting in Geneva , proposed possible fixes and made more dire warnings .
“ The way we use land is both part of the problem and also part of the solution , ” said Valerie Masson-Delmotte , a French climate scientist who co-chairs one of the panel ’ s working groups . “ Sustainable land management can help secure a future that is comfortable . ”
Scientists at Thursday ’ s press conference emphasized both the seriousness of the problem and the need to make societal changes soon .
“ We don ’ t want a message of despair , ” said science panel official Jim Skea , a professor at Imperial College London . “ We want to get across the message that every action makes a difference . ”
Still the stark message hit home hard for some of the authors .
“ I ’ ve lost a lot of sleep about what the science is saying . As a person , it ’ s pretty scary , ” Koko Warner , a manager in the U.N . Climate Change secretariat who helped write a report chapter on risk management and decision-making , told The ███ after the report was presented at the World Meteorological Organization headquarters in Geneva . “ We need to act urgently . ”
The report said climate change already has worsened land degradation , caused deserts to grow , permafrost to thaw and made forests more vulnerable to drought , fire , pests and disease . That ’ s happened even as much of the globe has gotten greener because of extra carbon dioxide in the air . Climate change has also added to the forces that have reduced the number of species on Earth .
“ Climate change is really slamming the land , ” said World Resources Institute researcher Kelly Levin , who wasn ’ t part of the study .
“ The stability of food supply is projected to decrease as the magnitude and frequency of extreme weather events that disrupt food chains increases , ” the report said .
In the worst-case scenario , food security problems change from moderate to high risk with just a few more tenths of a degree of warming from now . They go from high to “ very high ” risk with just another 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit ( 1 degree Celsius ) of warming from now .
“ The potential risk of multi-breadbasket failure is increasing , ” NASA ’ s Rosenzweig said . “ Just to give examples , the crop yields were effected in Europe just in the last two weeks . ”
Scientists had long thought one of the few benefits of higher levels of carbon dioxide , the major heat-trapping gas , was that it made plants grow more and the world greener , Rosenzweig said . But numerous studies show that the high levels of carbon dioxide reduce protein and nutrients in many crops .
For example , high levels of carbon in the air in experiments show wheat has 6 % to 13 % less protein , 4 % to 7 % less zinc and 5 % to 8 % less iron , she said .
But better farming practices — such as no-till agricultural and better targeted fertilizer applications — have the potential to fight global warming too , reducing carbon pollution up to 18 % of current emissions levels by 2050 , the report said .
If people change their diets , reducing red meat and increasing plant-based foods , such as fruits , vegetables and seeds , the world can save as much as another 15 % of current emissions by mid-century . It would also make people more healthy , Rosenzweig said .
The science panel said they aren ’ t telling people what to eat because that ’ s a personal choice .
Still , Hans-Otto Pörtner , a panel leader from Germany who said he lost weight and felt better after reducing his meat consumption , told a reporter that if she ate less ribs and more vegetables “ that ’ s a good decision and you will help the planet reduce greenhouse gas emissions . ”
Reducing food waste can fight climate change even more . The report said that between 2010 and 2016 , global food waste accounted for 8 % to 10 % of heat-trapping emissions .
“ Currently 25 % -30 % of total food produced is lost or wasted , ” the report said . Fixing that would free up millions of square miles of land .
With just another 0.9 degrees F of warming ( 0.5 degrees C ) , which could happen in the next 10 to 30 years , the risk of unstable food supplies , wildfire damage , thawing permafrost and water shortages in dry areas “ are projected to be high , ” the report said .
At another 1.8 degrees F of warming ( 1 degree C ) from now , which could happen in about 50 years , it said those risks “ are projected to be very high . ”
Most scenarios predict the world ’ s tropical regions will have “ unprecedented climatic conditions by the mid-to-late 21st century , ” the report noted .
Agriculture and forestry together account for about 23 % of the heat-trapping gases that are warming the Earth , slightly less than from cars , trucks , boats and planes . Add in transporting food , energy costs , packaging and that grows to 37 % , the report said .
But the land is also a great carbon “ sink , ” which sucks heat-trapping gases out of the air .
From about 2007 to 2016 , agriculture and forestry every year put 5.7 billion tons ( 5.2 billion metric tons ) of carbon dioxide into the air , but pulled 12.3 billion tons ( 11.2 billion metric tons ) of it out .
“ This additional gift from nature is limited . It ’ s not going to continue forever , ” said study co-author Luis Verchot , a scientist at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture in Colombia . “ If we continue to degrade ecosystems , if we continue to convert natural ecosystems , we continue to deforest and we continue to destroy our soils , we ’ re going to lose this natural subsidy . ”

GENEVA (AP) — Human-caused climate change is dramatically degrading the Earth’s land and the way people use the land is making global warming worse, a new United Nations scientific report says. That creates a vicious cycle which is already making food more expensive, scarcer and less nutritious.

“The cycle is accelerating,” said NASA climate scientist Cynthia Rosenzweig, a co-author of the report. “The threat of climate change affecting people’s food on their dinner table is increasing.”

But if people change the way they eat, grow food and manage forests, it could help save the planet from a far warmer future, scientists said.

Earth’s land masses, which are only 30% of the globe, are warming twice as fast as the planet as a whole. While heat-trapping gases are causing problems in the atmosphere, the land has been less talked about as part of climate change. A special report, written by more than 100 scientists and unanimously approved by diplomats from nations around the world Thursday at a meeting in Geneva, proposed possible fixes and made more dire warnings.

“The way we use land is both part of the problem and also part of the solution,” said Valerie Masson-Delmotte, a French climate scientist who co-chairs one of the panel’s working groups. “Sustainable land management can help secure a future that is comfortable.”

Scientists at Thursday’s press conference emphasized both the seriousness of the problem and the need to make societal changes soon.

“We don’t want a message of despair,” said science panel official Jim Skea, a professor at Imperial College London. “We want to get across the message that every action makes a difference.”

Still the stark message hit home hard for some of the authors.

“I’ve lost a lot of sleep about what the science is saying. As a person, it’s pretty scary,” Koko Warner, a manager in the U.N. Climate Change secretariat who helped write a report chapter on risk management and decision-making, told The Associated Press after the report was presented at the World Meteorological Organization headquarters in Geneva. “We need to act urgently.”

The report said climate change already has worsened land degradation, caused deserts to grow, permafrost to thaw and made forests more vulnerable to drought, fire, pests and disease. That’s happened even as much of the globe has gotten greener because of extra carbon dioxide in the air. Climate change has also added to the forces that have reduced the number of species on Earth.

“Climate change is really slamming the land,” said World Resources Institute researcher Kelly Levin, who wasn’t part of the study.

And the future could be worse.

“The stability of food supply is projected to decrease as the magnitude and frequency of extreme weather events that disrupt food chains increases,” the report said.

In the worst-case scenario, food security problems change from moderate to high risk with just a few more tenths of a degree of warming from now. They go from high to “very high” risk with just another 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) of warming from now.

“The potential risk of multi-breadbasket failure is increasing,” NASA’s Rosenzweig said. “Just to give examples, the crop yields were effected in Europe just in the last two weeks.”

Scientists had long thought one of the few benefits of higher levels of carbon dioxide, the major heat-trapping gas, was that it made plants grow more and the world greener, Rosenzweig said. But numerous studies show that the high levels of carbon dioxide reduce protein and nutrients in many crops.

For example, high levels of carbon in the air in experiments show wheat has 6% to 13% less protein, 4% to 7% less zinc and 5% to 8% less iron, she said.

But better farming practices — such as no-till agricultural and better targeted fertilizer applications — have the potential to fight global warming too, reducing carbon pollution up to 18% of current emissions levels by 2050, the report said.

If people change their diets, reducing red meat and increasing plant-based foods, such as fruits, vegetables and seeds, the world can save as much as another 15% of current emissions by mid-century. It would also make people more healthy, Rosenzweig said.

The science panel said they aren’t telling people what to eat because that’s a personal choice.

Still, Hans-Otto Pörtner, a panel leader from Germany who said he lost weight and felt better after reducing his meat consumption, told a reporter that if she ate less ribs and more vegetables “that’s a good decision and you will help the planet reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”

Reducing food waste can fight climate change even more. The report said that between 2010 and 2016, global food waste accounted for 8% to 10% of heat-trapping emissions.

“Currently 25%-30% of total food produced is lost or wasted,” the report said. Fixing that would free up millions of square miles of land.

With just another 0.9 degrees F of warming (0.5 degrees C), which could happen in the next 10 to 30 years, the risk of unstable food supplies, wildfire damage, thawing permafrost and water shortages in dry areas “are projected to be high,” the report said.

At another 1.8 degrees F of warming (1 degree C) from now, which could happen in about 50 years, it said those risks “are projected to be very high.”

Most scenarios predict the world’s tropical regions will have “unprecedented climatic conditions by the mid-to-late 21st century,” the report noted.

Agriculture and forestry together account for about 23% of the heat-trapping gases that are warming the Earth, slightly less than from cars, trucks, boats and planes. Add in transporting food, energy costs, packaging and that grows to 37%, the report said.

But the land is also a great carbon “sink,” which sucks heat-trapping gases out of the air.

From about 2007 to 2016, agriculture and forestry every year put 5.7 billion tons (5.2 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide into the air, but pulled 12.3 billion tons (11.2 billion metric tons) of it out.

“This additional gift from nature is limited. It’s not going to continue forever,” said study co-author Luis Verchot, a scientist at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture in Colombia. “If we continue to degrade ecosystems, if we continue to convert natural ecosystems, we continue to deforest and we continue to destroy our soils, we’re going to lose this natural subsidy.”

Overall land emissions are increasing, especially because of cutting down forests in the Amazon in places such as Brazil, Colombia and Peru, Verchot said.

Recent forest management changes in Brazil “contradicts all the messages that are coming out of the report,” Pörtner said.

Saying “our current way of living and our economic system risks our future and the future of our children,” Germany’s environment minister, Svenja Schulze, questioned whether it makes sense for a country like Germany to import large amounts of soy from Latin America, where forests are being destroyed to plant the crop, to feed unsustainable numbers of livestock in Germany.

“We ought to recognize that we have profound limits on the amount of land available and we have to be careful about how we utilize it,” said Stanford University environmental sciences chief Chris Field, who wasn’t part of the report.

Some fossil-fuel firms say no.,2017-05-02,Laurent Belsie,"As a candidate , Donald Trump appealed to Americans ’ worries about jobs by vowing to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement and end job-killing environmental regulations . But what happens if President Trump calls for a revolt on the international agreement and corporate America doesn ’ t show up ?
Increasingly , US businesses have been coming to the conclusion that they ’ re better off if the United States sticks with the Paris accord . Although it may seem counterintuitive , oil and gas companies ranging from ExxonMobil to Royal Dutch Shell , and even coal company Cloud Peak Energy , are pressing the Trump administration not to withdraw from the accord . The dearth of corporate support for a pullout makes it less likely the president will carry through on his campaign promise to “ cancel ” the agreement , although top administration officials are still reportedly leaning that way .
The corporate resistance also suggests that US companies are looking beyond the Trump administration and seeing more strategic advantage in helping to shape regulation , rather than trying to stop it cold .
“ Companies are looking at the Trump administration policies and they ’ ve seen this before in the Reagan years , ” says Andrew Hoffman , a professor of sustainable enterprise at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor . “ And they say : ‘ We 've seen the blowback ’ ” when President Reagan backtracked and replaced highly controversial appointments at the Interior Department and the Environmental Protection Administration with more mainstream figures .
Businesses support the Paris accord for a range of reasons – from the altruistic to the less-than-noble . For oil companies , instead of backing out of the accord , “ a smarter course would be to stay in Paris and weaken it from within , ” says Professor Hoffman .
That may sound cynical , but it ’ s actually a business axiom that may prove key in helping to garner support from other businesses for climate-friendly policies , sustainability experts say .
“ My definition of sustainable is doing the right thing for the environment and making money – and it 's not always in that order , ” says Steve Hellem , president of Navista , a Washington-based public affairs group that helps companies and other entities meet their sustainability objectives . “ It 's the recognition that business will always do what is in its own best interest . ”
More and more businesses are concluding that action to address climate change is in their interests , according to a report released last week by World Wildlife Fund , Ceres , Calvert Research and Management , and CDP ( formerly , the Carbon Disclosure Project ) . Among Fortune 100 companies , 63 percent have set one or more clean energy targets ; among Fortune 500 companies , 48 percent have at least one climate or clean energy target , up 5 percent since a 2014 report . And the plans are increasingly ambitious , according to the report . IBM , Microsoft , and some 190 other Fortune 500 companies report saving nearly $ 3.7 billion in 2016 on energy efforts that reduced emissions by the equivalent of 45 coal-fired power plants .
Being climate-friendly is especially important to consumer-facing companies , which may explain why 72 percent of consumer staples firms in the Fortune 500 have set clean-energy goals . By contrast , the report finds that only 11 percent in the energy sector – where profits and carbon emissions often go hand-in-hand – have done the same .
Some business leaders conclude it 's simply the right thing to do . And they hope the president is listening to their message .
“ The voice of business is an important voice to hear , ” says Jim Epstein , the founder of an Elkwood , Va. food company , who was in Washington this week as part of the American Sustainable Business Council ’ s effort to lobby Congress around the view that climate change and the environment align with free-market opportunity .
Other companies see the threat of climate change as a business opportunity , especially when it comes to selling new products and hiring the best and brightest Millennials , who tend to support climate-friendly policies .
This is even a factor in the fossil fuel sector . The natural-gas company Cheniere , for example , would benefit from a global shift from coal to natural gas-fired electricity . Coal companies see climate policy as a vehicle to receive support for carbon capture technology .
The risks of not being climate-friendly have also risen , as oil and gas companies are finding out .
Some investors are beginning to flee the oil and gas sector . Last Thursday , Harvard University announced it was “ pausing ” investments in several fossil fuel interests , following similar moves from Columbia and Yale . These are the first steps toward potential divestment from influential institutional investors .
The risks of lawsuits are rising . Exxon , in particular , is the target of class-action suits and investigations by the attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts around the premise that the company knew that global warming and the threat of regulation were real , but continued to mislead shareholders about the value of its assets . The US Securities and Exchange Commission is also looking at the company ’ s valuation of its oil reserves in a period of low prices and potential restrictions on carbon emissions .
Also last week , Moody ’ s Investors Service released a research paper arguing that as soon as 2020 , oil and gas companies ’ revenues could face material risks from lower demand for their products because of government policies , changing consumer preferences , and disruptive technologies , such as electric cars and alternative energy .
“ The industry ’ s product can not be changed and no technology exists at scale to mitigate its carbon emissions , ” the report concluded . The Paris agreement “ represents a substantial threat to the oil and gas industry . ”
So why would oil companies support it ? One reason is that , as a voluntary agreement , it doesn ’ t have any teeth , as opposed to the Obama administration ’ s Clean Power Plan regulations , which many energy companies balked at and which the Trump administration is starting to dismantle .
“ My guess is that we 'll stay in [ the Paris agreement ] because it allows us to participate in the negotiations and it does n't require us to do anything ” specific , says Robert Brulle , a professor of sociology and environmental science at Drexel University in Philadelphia . That would give the companies time to try to delay or minimize regulations .
This also may explain why oil companies often sound contradictory when addressing climate change . Exxon several years ago acknowledged that global warming was real and required action , but was still funding the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council , which has questioned the role of human activity , according to a 2016 report by the American Geophysical Union .
Chevron , long an outspoken critic of climate legislation , last year opposed a shareholder resolution that it detail the business risks from climate legislation . But earlier this year , it became the first major oil company to acknowledge in its 10-K annual report the heightened business risks from potential governmental investigations and private suits around climate change .
In March , Chevron chief executive John Watson said publicly that debate over climate change centers on humans ' role in driving it , a common line among climate-change skeptics . But in the same month , the company released a report that said : “ Chevron … recognizes that the use of fossil fuels to meet the world ’ s energy needs contributes to the rising concentration of greenhouse gases ( GHGs ) in Earth ’ s atmosphere . ”
Hoffman explains that corporations are political entities that incorporate competing interests and are speaking to multiple audiences , just like governments . And at a time of regulatory uncertainty , it makes business sense for oil companies to hedge their bets .
Viewed from that perspective of business interests , the entire climate debate could be made less politically divisive if it were recast as energy efficiency , argues Mr. Hellem of Navista .

Just last week , the training and preparedness of the Granite Mountain Hot Shot Crew was profiled by The Daily Courier . May they rest in peace .","An elite crew of firefighters trained to battle the nation's fiercest wildfires was overtaken by an out-of-control blaze in Arizona, killing 19 members as they tried to protect themselves from the flames under fire-resistant shields.



It was the most firefighters killed battling a wildfire in the U.S. in decades.



The lightning-sparked fire, which spread to at least 2,000 acres amid triple-digit temperatures, also destroyed 200 homes and sent hundreds fleeing from Yarnell, a town of about 700 residents about 85 miles northwest of Phoenix. Residents huddled in shelters and bars, watching their homes burn on TV as flames lit up the night sky in the forest above the town.



“My heart weeps for those who lost their lives and were affected by today’s Yarnell Hill Fire. My thoughts and prayers go out to the families who have lost so much and the first responders battling this difficult situation. I urge others to join me in keeping those affected by this tragic fire in our thoughts and prayers. My office and I will continue to closely monitor the situation and remain in communication with emergency responders. Please do not hesitate to contact my office if we can be of assistance.”

The Pembroke , Illinois , pipeline would shuttle natural gas into an area of the state that suffers from high energy prices , according to Jackson .
“ When we move to another form of energy , that ’ s fine by me , I support that , ” Jackson told Axios in February as the issue began heating up . “ But in the meantime , you can not put the black farmers on hold until that day comes . ”
Pembroke residents have a median income of $ 28,922 and rely on a combination of propane , wood stoves , and space heaters for heat during Illinois winters , media reports show .
Residents of the town want to know why other parts of Illinois have access to gas but they must rely on wood and propane .
“ Everyone else has [ gas service ] , ” Levi , a 52-year-old construction worker and resident , told the Chicago Tribune in December 2019 as Jackson promoted the pipeline . “ I ’ m unclear why it ’ s so hard for us to get it . ”
Another resident—Cathy Vanderdyz , a city clerk in the area—told Axios that she pays between $ 500 and $ 800 to heat her home over a two-month period . Jackson got involved due in part to a request from Mark Hodge , mayor of Hopkins Park , a town in the area .
The mayor told Axios that businesses refuse to come to the area because local energy prices are too high .
“ It ’ s not on my radar at this point , not to say in the future it would not be , ” Hodges said of climate change . “ My main concern is cutting our energy costs out here. ” Customers have to pay for some of the cost of delivering such pipeline access under current regulations .
Pembroke residents must pay $ 3.2 million of the estimated total $ 8.2 million pipeline extension , according to Nicor Gas , the company behind the project . Each household would have to pay more than $ 8,000 upfront for access , Axios notes .
Illinois ’ s state Legislature is considering a bill designating Pembroke as a “ designated hardship area , ” which would allow Nicor Gas to pay the entire cost .
Jackson , the Rev . Al Sharpton , and National Urban League President Marc Morial have said in the past that they oppose an abrupt move away from fracking , a technique producers use to extract natural gas from shale . They said the technique for producing natural gas helps black people who struggle with high energy prices .

Lockdowns , travel bans and closed manufacturing sites have caused global emissions to drop by 4.6 % , or 2.5 gigatonnes , according to a University of Sydney review of 38 regions and 26 sectors published in the journal Plos One . Fine particle pollution decreased by 3.8 % and two other types of air pollution declined 2.9 % : sulfur dioxide – which is linked to a number of respiratory issues , and nitrogen oxide , which leads to smog .
The largest emissions drops occurred in the United States and China , largely due to grounded air travel and a decrease in power , water and gas use , but they come with a large economic cost .
From late February to May , the study found the pandemic caused 147 million people , or 4.2 % of the global workforce , to lose full-time jobs and triggered a $ 3.8tn drop in consumption , making it the worst economic shock since the Great Depression , according to co-author Arunima Malik .
Europe also saw a significant economic dip , but it lagged in emissions reductions because its economy is less reliant on fossil fuels .
The dramatic decline still falls short of the efforts needed to limit global heating to 1.5C by 2050 , however . Even if global greenhouse gas emissions were to sustain the 4.6 % decline each year , emissions would need to drop another 3 % every year between 2020 and 2030 to be on track to limit global warming and avoid the most extreme outcomes of the climate crisis . And emissions will rebound as countries reopen .
The last time the globe experienced a dramatic drop in emissions was during the 2009 financial crisis , which decreased carbon dioxide emissions by 0.46 gigatonnes .
The economic downturn of the last three months will deepen socioeconomic vulnerabilities , widen wealth gaps and overburden healthcare systems , especially in lower-income countries , according to the study .
“ This is the dilemma of the social , environmental and economic systems – the fact that these systems are so interconnected and you can ’ t really address one system in isolation , ” Malik said . “ So there ’ s an economic downturn that results in reduction of emissions . But so many people have lost their jobs , and the environment might not be the top priority for them . ”
A separate new analysis from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Yale and Northwestern universities found that pushing back investments in renewable power for one year could outweigh the emissions reductions and deaths avoided from the reductions in pollution that have been seen since March .
Malik said the reductions necessary would require a complete redesign of the economic systems .
“ When it comes to the post-pandemic world , I would like to think that perhaps this is an opportunity for us to redesign the systems in a way that they are sustainable and inclusive , ” Malik said . “ I don ’ t have a perfect answer to this and I don ’ t think most people do – it ’ s a dilemma in our systems . ”","The coronavirus pandemic has led to the largest drop in heat-trapping emissions in human history, according to a new study.
