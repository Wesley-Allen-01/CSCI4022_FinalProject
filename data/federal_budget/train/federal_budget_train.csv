Mr. Obama ’ s spending agreement with Congress will suspend the nation ’ s debt limit and allow the Treasury to borrow another $ 1.5 trillion or so by the end of his presidency in 2017 . Added to the current total national debt of more than $ 18.15 trillion , the red ink will likely be crowding the $ 20 trillion mark right around the time Mr. Obama leaves the White House .
When Mr. Obama took over in January 2009 , the total national debt stood at $ 10.6 trillion . That means the debt will have very nearly doubled during his eight years in office , and there is much more debt ahead with the abandonment of “ sequestration ” spending caps enacted in 2011 .
“ Congress and the president have just agreed to undo one of the only successful fiscal restraint mechanisms in a generation , ” said Pete Sepp , president of the National Taxpayers Union . “ The progress on reducing spending and the deficit has just become much more problematic . ”
Some budget analysts scoff at the claim made by the administration and by House Speaker John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican , that the budget agreement ’ s $ 112 billion in spending increases is fully funded by cuts elsewhere . Mr. Boehner left Congress last week .
“ The Boehner-Obama spending agreement would allow for unlimited borrowing by the Treasury until March 2017 , ” said Paul Winfree , director of economic policy studies at The Heritage Foundation . “ This deal piles on billions of dollars to the national debt by increasing spending over the next three years and then not paying for it for a decade — with half of the offsets not occurring until 2025 . ”
The bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that only about half of the increased spending in the budget deal is paid for . Rather than a spending increase of $ 80 billion over two years , the nonprofit group said , the actual spending hike is $ 154 billion when interest costs and budget gimmicks are factored into the equation .
“ Of this $ 154 billion , about $ 78 billion is paid for honestly ” through Medicare reforms , reductions in farm subsidies , asset sales and other measures , the group said . “ The remaining $ 56 billion of the legislation — mostly the war spending increase and interest costs — is not paid for at all . ”
Of course , Congress bears equal responsibility for the high level of debt . A prime reason that Mr. Boehner left office was conservatives ’ displeasure with his accommodation of the president ’ s budget requests , aside from three years of “ sequestration ” spending caps that helped limit annual deficits .
“ We will be raising the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion , ” said Sen. Rand Paul , a Kentucky Republican who tried to filibuster the budget deal before the Senate approved it in the wee hours of Friday . “ We will be giving President Obama a free pass to borrow as much money as he can borrow in the last year of his office . No limit , no dollar limit . Here you go , President Obama . Spend what you want . ”
The president said Friday that the agreement “ is paid for in a responsible , balanced way . ”
“ This agreement will strengthen the middle class by investing in education , job training , and basic research , ” Mr. Obama said . “ It will keep us safe by investing in our national security . It protects our seniors by avoiding harmful cuts to Medicare and Social Security . It locks in two years of funding and should help break the cycle of shutdowns and manufactured crises that have harmed our economy . ”
When Mr. Obama talks about fiscal matters , he usually takes credit for cutting the deficit by two-thirds . He also is correct that annual budget deficits have fallen from $ 1.4 trillion in fiscal 2009 , in the depths of the recession , to $ 439 billion in fiscal 2015 .
But the president rarely , if ever , mentions the accumulation of those annual deficits and what the rising national debt means for the country , for the presidents who will follow him and for the nation ’ s ability to pay for its priorities .
“ Debt service will continue to consume a larger portion of the federal budget , and we ’ ll be looking at gross interest payments on the national debt of close to $ 1 trillion [ annually ] by the time another decade passes , ” Mr. Sepp said .
Annual net interest payments on the national debt are projected to rise from around $ 220 billion currently to $ 755 billion in 10 years . Policymakers in Washington have been fortunate to date because interest rates have been at historic lows for several years .
“ Debt payments comprise 6 percent of all spending now , but will more than double to 13 percent in 2025 , ” said Demian Brady , The National Taxpayers Union Foundation ’ s director of research . The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office “ cites two main causal factors : an expected eventual rise in interest rates , and the continuing expansion of the federal debt . ”
Supporters of the budget agreement point to structural reforms in entitlement programs , including a deal that will prevent a 20 percent across-the-board cut in Social Security Disability Insurance benefits for 11 million people next year .
But Mr. Sepp said it ’ s not clear whether the provision represents meaningful reform or another budget gimmick .
“ The infusion of cash from the retirement portion of the [ Social Security ] program will carry disability insurance for several years before any of the major reforms to the program fully kick in , ” he said . “ Lawmakers are claiming that they stopped kicking the can down the road on [ Social Security Disability Insurance ] when they ’ ve really just kicked the can into another lane of the road . ”
Fiscal conservatives say it doesn ’ t seem to matter which party controls the White House or Congress when it comes to spending increases .
“ When I ran for office in 2010 , the debt was an enormous issue and the debt was $ 10 trillion , ” Mr. Paul said Friday on the Senate floor . “ Some of us in the tea party were concerned because it had doubled in the [ previous ] eight years . It doubled from five [ trillion dollars ] to 10 under a Republican administration . And many of us were adamant that Republicans needed to do a better job . We had added new entitlement programs , we had added new spending , and the deficit got worse under Republicans . Now we ’ re under a Democrat president , and it ’ s set to double again . ”","When President Obama signs into law the new two-year budget deal Monday, his action will bring into sharper focus a part of his legacy that he doesn’t like to talk about: He is the $20 trillion man.

Prepare for the end of food safety as we have known it. For a breakdown in public order. For little children languishing in ignorance. If only Edward Gibbon were here to chronicle the devastation. On March 1, the fabric of our civilization begins to unwind.

That’s when the economy begins to stall and we turn our back on our values, all because the federal government will have to begin to cut a few tens of billions of dollars from the largest budget the world has ever known.

Story Continued Below

This is the lurid fairy tale spun by President Barack Obama. In the fight over the sequester, he is resorting to the tried-and-true (and tiresome) strategy of every official confronted with budget cuts he doesn’t want to implement, from the commander in chief to a lowly bureaucrat toiling at some school district: maximize the scare-mongering and pain.

In Hans Christian Andersen terms, Obama is the princess and the sequester is the pea. Over the next 10 years, the sequester amounts to a $1.16 trillion cut, or roughly 3 cents on every federal dollar. If we can’t squeeze a couple of pennies out of every dollar, we might as well begin our great national bankruptcy proceedings right now.

This year we are supposed to cut $85 billion from a $3.5 trillion budget. And it won’t even be that much. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the federal government won’t be able to cut the full $85 billion. It will manage to cut only about half that in 2013.

As Yuval Levin of the journal National Affairs points out, even with the sequester, the federal government will spend a little more in 2013 than in 2012, $3.553 compared to $3.538 trillion. Welcome to the Age of Austerity.

Even with the sequester, nondefense discretionary spending will still be up almost 10 percent since 2008. Even with the sequester, federal spending is projected to be a robust 22.8 percent of gross domestic product in 2023. Even with the sequester, the debt will hit 100 percent of GDP just two years later than it would otherwise, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.

It’s hard to see how a cut of a little more than $40 billion this year can possibly tank a $16 trillion economy. Or why keeping the deficit the same it is projected to be this year, at about $845 billion with the sequester cuts already accounted for, will be a shock too severe for the economy to take.

federal_budget,Christian Science Monitor,1,http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC-Decoder/Decoder-Wire/2013/0920/Having-contradictory-thoughts-about-the-debt-ceiling-You-re-not-alone,Having contradictory thoughts about the debt ceiling? You're not alone.,2013-09-20,Linda Feldmann,"Doug Elmendorf sounds frustrated , in a good-natured way . The head of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office sees big fiscal problems looming for America , and the public just doesn ’ t get it .
The CBO chief says most members of Congress understand the problem : Federal health and retirement programs threaten to overwhelm the budget and damage the economy , unless Washington does something . But the public complicates things .
“ One obstacle to progress is that I ’ m not sure that members of the public understand the nature of the challenge , ” Mr. Elmendorf told reporters at a Monitor breakfast this week .
“ I think there are many people in the country who don ’ t like federal spending in the abstract and don ’ t want to pay more in taxes to support more federal spending in the abstract , but who actually put great value on the benefits they receive from Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid , ” says the Princeton- and Harvard-trained economist .
Elmendorf doesn ’ t blame the Average Joe for not spending hours poring over the CBO ’ s website , reading his blog , and checking out the reports . ( Oh , and CBO also now has two Twitter accounts : @ USCBO and @ USCBOcostest . ) But having a well-informed public might make his – and Congress ’ s and the president ’ s – job easier .
The public ’ s seemingly contradictory views play out repeatedly in opinion polls on the fast-approaching limit on Washington ’ s borrowing authority , known as the debt ceiling .
The Washington Post ’ s `` Fix '' blog points to two numbers in the latest Post-ABC News poll : First is the 43 percent of Americans who don ’ t want Congress to raise the debt limit and thus are willing to allow the nation to go into default . Second is the 73 percent who say going into default would do “ serious harm ” to the economy .
The Fix folks crunched the numbers and found that those who hold both views simultaneously – don ’ t want to raise the debt limit and yet also believe it will harm the economy – amount to 26 percent of the American public .
Either these people aren ’ t thinking straight , or , the Fix suggests , they are willing to put up with “ short-term pain for long-term gain ” – a crisis that forces politicians to solve the problem , despite the huge risks .
The Post poll also found that while big majorities of both Republicans and Democrats agree that defaulting on the debt would be really bad for the economy , opinion breaks down along party lines over whether Congress should raise the debt ceiling . Democrats are for it , Republicans are against it .
So , it seems , politics plays a big part in how people feel about what to do when the government reaches the end of its borrowing authority in mid-October .
Maybe we shouldn ’ t even be paying attention to polls on the debt ceiling , some commentators suggest .
“ There ’ s nothing quite as useless as a debt-ceiling poll , ” writes Steve Benen on the liberal `` Maddow Blog . '' “ Folks have no idea what the debt ceiling is , what default is , what bond markets are , or what the full faith and credit of the United States means , so polling on the subject tells us nothing . ”
Lots of people think agreeing to raise the debt ceiling means signing up for more debt , when in fact , it ’ s about paying debts already incurred , Mr. Benen says .
Congress routinely raised the debt ceiling more than 100 times over the years , until 2011 . Then , raising the debt ceiling got embroiled in budget negotiations , and the nation went to the edge of its borrowing authority , straining the economy and hurting the political standing of the president and Republicans . Standard & Poor ’ s lowered America ’ s credit rating .
Such ugly policymaking is unnecessary in a representative democracy , Benen suggests .
“ Indeed , at a certain level , the American public is counting on elected officials to do right by the country , even if the public does n't know it , ” he writes .

The head of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office sees big fiscal problems looming for America, and the public just doesn’t get it.

The CBO chief says most members of Congress understand the problem: Federal health and retirement programs threaten to overwhelm the budget and damage the economy, unless Washington does something. But the public complicates things.

“One obstacle to progress is that I’m not sure that members of the public understand the nature of the challenge,” Mr. Elmendorf told reporters at a Monitor breakfast this week.

“I think there are many people in the country who don’t like federal spending in the abstract and don’t want to pay more in taxes to support more federal spending in the abstract, but who actually put great value on the benefits they receive from Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid,” says the Princeton- and Harvard-trained economist.

Elmendorf doesn’t blame the Average Joe for not spending hours poring over the CBO’s website, reading his blog, and checking out the reports. (Oh, and CBO also now has two Twitter accounts: @USCBO and @USCBOcostest.) But having a well-informed public might make his – and Congress’s and the president’s – job easier.

The public’s seemingly contradictory views play out repeatedly in opinion polls on the fast-approaching limit on Washington’s borrowing authority, known as the debt ceiling.

The Washington Post’s ""Fix"" blog points to two numbers in the latest Post-ABC News poll: First is the 43 percent of Americans who don’t want Congress to raise the debt limit and thus are willing to allow the nation to go into default. Second is the 73 percent who say going into default would do “serious harm” to the economy.

The Fix folks crunched the numbers and found that those who hold both views simultaneously – don’t want to raise the debt limit and yet also believe it will harm the economy – amount to 26 percent of the American public.

Either these people aren’t thinking straight, or, the Fix suggests, they are willing to put up with “short-term pain for long-term gain” – a crisis that forces politicians to solve the problem, despite the huge risks.

The Post poll also found that while big majorities of both Republicans and Democrats agree that defaulting on the debt would be really bad for the economy, opinion breaks down along party lines over whether Congress should raise the debt ceiling. Democrats are for it, Republicans are against it.

So, it seems, politics plays a big part in how people feel about what to do when the government reaches the end of its borrowing authority in mid-October.

Maybe we shouldn’t even be paying attention to polls on the debt ceiling, some commentators suggest.

“There’s nothing quite as useless as a debt-ceiling poll,” writes Steve Benen on the liberal ""Maddow Blog."" “Folks have no idea what the debt ceiling is, what default is, what bond markets are, or what the full faith and credit of the United States means, so polling on the subject tells us nothing.”

Lots of people think agreeing to raise the debt ceiling means signing up for more debt, when in fact, it’s about paying debts already incurred, Mr. Benen says.

Congress routinely raised the debt ceiling more than 100 times over the years, until 2011. Then, raising the debt ceiling got embroiled in budget negotiations, and the nation went to the edge of its borrowing authority, straining the economy and hurting the political standing of the president and Republicans. Standard & Poor’s lowered America’s credit rating.

Such ugly policymaking is unnecessary in a representative democracy, Benen suggests.

“Indeed, at a certain level, the American public is counting on elected officials to do right by the country, even if the public doesn't know it,” he writes.

But now that the debt ceiling has been politicized, it may be hard to go back to the way things used to be. The CBO's Elmendorf, whose job is to serve members of Congress, says there’s little he can actively do to promote public understanding of the nation’s fiscal imbalance – and the choices Americans face.

At least, he says, there’s the CBO website.

“I think that by making our work for the Congress available more broadly, we are helping to educate people,” Elmendorf says. “But of course, the people who find their way to our website are going to be those who are disproportionately, one might say rather peculiarly, interested in the federal budget.”

The simmering feud between House Republicans and movement conservatives is finally an all-out war.

The tension exploded on Wednesday morning when Speaker John Boehner and outside conservative groups traded sharp barbs over the budget deal Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) crafted with Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.). It only escalated later in the day when the leader of the right-wing Republican Study Committee forced out its longtime executive director for leaking private conversations about strategy to those organizations.

Story Continued Below

The frenzied activity — just days before the House is scheduled to recess until 2014 — represents the ultimate culmination of a power struggle between institutional Republicans in Congress and outside groups, which are funded by well-heeled conservative donors and can pay for primary challenges.

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Boehner, an Ohio Republican, accused outside conservative groups of “using our members and they’re using the American people for their own goals.”

Republican leaders have long accused those outside groups — Heritage Action, Club for Growth and Americans for Prosperity, to name a few — of existing solely to oppose them. Many of these organizations accuse Boehner, his leadership team and some Republican members of Congress of being a bunch of squishes willing to abandon their conservative principles in favor of compromises.

More than 50 members of conservative groups signed onto a statement Wednesday evening responding to both Boehner’s remarks and Teller’s dismissal.

“It is clear that the conservative movement has come under attack on Capitol Hill today,” the statement read.

All of that was private, relegated to fundraisers and K Street lunchroom chatter, until now.

The two sides are fighting over strategy, politics and policy — and, in a way, this skirmish neatly encapsulates the existential battle for the soul of the Republican Party. They are showing the tug between purity versus pragmatism, and loyalty versus the pedal-to-the-metal tactics to drag the a party to the right.

Boehner’s line of attack against outside groups follows a similar tack by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has focused his outrage on the Senate Conservatives Fund. He even blessed the National Republican Senatorial Committee’s blacklisting of consulting firms that do business with the group.

“John Boehner has apparently decided to join Mitch McConnell in the war on conservatives,” Senate Conservatives Fund executive Director Matt Hoskins said. “McConnell called us fringe traitors who should be locked in a bar and punched in the nose, and now Boehner is lashing out at us too. Conservatives everywhere need to understand that the party’s leadership has declared war on them. If they don’t fight back, they will always regret it. We’re going to hang together or hang separately.”

Then Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) upped the ante.

The chairman of the RSC, the bastion of right-wing strategy on Capitol Hill, fired the group’s longtime executive director Paul Teller for leaking member-level conversations to the outside groups, according to a senior Republican aide.

( Also on POLITICO: Conservatives balk at budget deal)

“Paul was divulging private, member-level conversations and actively working against strategies developed by RSC members,” said the senior GOP aide familiar with the group. “Trust between senior staff and RSC members is paramount. No staffer is above a member.”

Scalise and Teller didn’t immediately comment.

If there was any staffer on Capitol Hill that was nearly as powerful as a member of Congress, it was Teller. He has been involved in conservative strategy for more than a decade, helping drag legislative debates to the right. But he often chafed on Republican leadership, who saw him as causing intraparty drama.

Conservatives reacted with outrage at what they perceived as a one-two punch to try and squelch the tea party.

“The fact they are making an example of Paul is clearly a message to staffers and other members that they will take a pound of flesh if they go against them on this sellout budget deal,” said one Senate Republican aide with close ties to the tea party. “It’s disgraceful. This is clearly Paul Ryan and John Boehner cracking down on dissent in the House. It shows the hostility the establishment has to tea party-minded staffers.”

( Also on POLITICO: The new Paul Ryan)

There’s no evidence, however, that Boehner and Ryan were at all involved in Teller’s ouster.

Friction between GOP lawmakers and the outside groups has been brewing for months. For example, Heritage Action urged Republican leadership to strip food stamps from the farm bill. When Republican leadership did, Heritage Action still urged lawmakers to vote against the bill. The group irked the RSC so much that it banned Heritage Action aides from attending their weekly meeting.

After the government shutdown, top Republicans, frustrated with the tea party hijacking their agenda, urged business groups to get more active in primaries.

But the groups who have drawn the most ire aren’t changing their strategy.

Heritage Action’s Dan Holler said Republicans who vote for Ryan’s budget will have to explain their support to their constituents.

“Americans are deeply concerned about the direction of the country,” he said. “Over the next few days, lawmakers will have to explain to their constituents, many of whom are our members, what they’ve achieved by increasing spending, increasing taxes and offering up another round of promises waiting to be broken.

• Dems slipping away from Reid on budget deal

• ObamaCare navigators not trained, committing fraud

• Vast majority believes ObamaCare will harm them

• Fournier: The devolution of Obama

• Sheriff Joe tries stop and frisk

DEMS SLIPPING AWAY FROM REID ON BUDGET DEAL - Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin told CBS’ “Face the Nation” that his team will need at least eight Republicans to pass a two-year budget deal approved last week by the Republican controlled House. That’s his way of saying that three members of the Democratic conference have already told him that they will not vote for the deal. Which three? Vulnerable Democrats Sen. Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Kay Hagan of North Carolina have been noncommittal, but Fox News First suspects that the trouble is on the left. No word as yet from Elizabeth Warren, the freshman Democrat who has taken the reins of the liberal wing of Reid’s conference. Every vote Reid loses means another he will have to get from Republicans. John Boehner delivered. Can Reid?

[Drucker’s got the deets - Washington Examiner’s David Drucker looks at how the deal came together.]

Is eight not enough? - Republican Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake, both of Arizona and Susan Collins of Maine all said they would vote for the bill and another four – Bob Corker of Tennessee, Thad Cochran of Mississippi, Johnny Isakson of Georgia and Mike Johanns of Nebraska were undecided, but sounded like they were leaning toward voting “yea.” Moderates like Mark Kirk of Illinois and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee seem unlikely to filibuster the budget deal, so what is Team Reid hinting at? Do they need more? Lawmakers return to town today to start jawboning the deal in person.

Fight! Fight! Fight! - How did Team Boehner sell the small-beer budget deal? The promise of fights still to come. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., says the Feb. 7 debt-limit battle will be consequential. “We don’t want ‘nothing’ out of the debt limit. We’re going to decide what it is we can accomplish out of this debt limit fight,” Ryan told “Fox News Sunday” host Chris Wallace. Fox News has more.

[“For those of us who believe the federal government is too big, too intrusive, too involved in our lives, what [the budget deal] tells us is that if we want a budget deal we can wrap our arms around, we're going to have to win in the 2014 election…Things are much different a year from now if Republicans are in charge of the Senate.” – Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wis., on NBC’s “Meet the Press”]

OBAMACARE NAVIGATORS NOT TRAINED, COMMITTING FRAUD - A House Government and Oversight Committee report, first obtained by Breitbart has found, “Obamacare Navigators have been giving Americans misinformation and, in some cases, actively encouraging enrollees to commit fraud in order to raise their subsidies. To complicate matters further, there is no way for Americans to find out whether their Navigators are properly certified.”

VAST MAJORITY BELIEVE OBAMACARE WILL HARM THEM - Most Americans feel that ObamaCare will make their own care worse. The latest AP/GfK poll finds nearly four in five respondents see their policies changing for the worse under ObamaCare. Another 69 percent expect their premiums to go up, with another 59 percent bracing for a rise in deductibles. About sixty percent of respondents not approving of the way President Obama is handling healthcare.

Generation gap - The latest from the USAToday/Pew poll shows Millennials still souring on President Obama and his signature law. Fifty-four percent of young people disapproved of his signature entitlement program. Obama’s job approval with adults under 30 clocked in at 46 percent, down from 67 percent a year ago. Fox News has more.

Looked good on paper - Daily Caller reports well over 50,000 paper applications for ObamaCare have yet to be processed. The government has taken on an outside contractor to assist in the backlog. Nearly 100,000 paper applications have been processed with consumers just recently finding out the results. Officials have now resorted to calling these individuals, encouraging them to sign up online. The paper applications do not actually enroll individuals in ObamaCare but merely determines their eligibility.

[The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services conceded over the weekend that 15,000 ObamaCare transactions were either not recorded or had errors. A spokesperson attributed the problem to “larger technical system issues.” The total number of corrupted transactions is not known. The issues could result in thousands believing they have coverage facing a gap on Jan. 1.]

BRITS FURIOUS OVER BOTCHED CARE - A series of damning reports about the quality and availability of care under Britain’s National Health Service have brought that nation’s government-run health system to political center stage. As the Daily Mail reports, the topic is usually off limits to politicians owing to the sacrosanct status of universal care. But as the body count rises from hospital botches and patients grow frustrated with the inability to get doctors, politicians are gingerly picking up the topic. Among the stunning revelations: Nearly a quarter of expectant mothers were abandoned by their midwives. Another study found deadly, egregious mistakes made on a regular basis in the nation’s hospitals. A survey also shows that families have mostly given up on securing appointments with their doctors. Public confidence in the system has plunged to record lows as the government is seeking to address the issue. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt recently said that NHS staff often confided in him about poor care.

FOURNIER: THE DEVOLUTION OF OBAMA - Ron Fournier considers a recent WaPo report about the administration delaying controversial rules ahead of the 2012 election for National Journal. Fournier offers this scathing criticism, “The Obama White House put politics before governing in 2012, lied about it, and still won't own up to it...Obama's apologists will say that every president plays politics with policy in elections years. Two problems with that. First, Obama promised to be better than the status quo. Second, he's worse.”

MCCAIN IN THE UKRAINE - Senators John McCain, R-Ariz., and Chris Murphy, D-Conn., join the tug-of-war over the Ukraine this weekend. The senators traveled to Kiev to rally with hundreds of thousands of protesters against President Viktor Yanukovich. “These people love the United States of America, they love freedom, and I don’t think you could view this as anything but our traditional support for people who want free and democratic society,” McCain said on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday. Protesters have been rallying since November after Yanukovich refused to sign a European Union agreement, opting for closer ties with Vladimir Putin’s Russia instead. WaPo has the story.

‘We’re not mad, we just want to talk…’ - The head of the National Security Administration task force investigating leaks by former contractor Edward Snowden, says he would be open to brokering a deal with Snowden. Rick Ledgett told CBS News’ “60 Minutes” that he would consider a deal with Snowden over the remaining documents he hasn’t leaked. Russia has granted asylum to Snowden. Snowden has said he would return to the U.S. if he is granted amnesty.

BAIER TRACKS: SCROOGES? - “Is the Federal Reserve dialing back for Christmas? The WSJ polled (sorry, paywalled) the members of the central bank’s board and found growing readiness to ‘taper.’ This could be the first sign that the Fed will really start to dial back its purchase of Treasury bonds flooding money into the US economy – about $85 billion a month. The stock market seemed to be ok with an improving economy, which was new last week with jobs numbers. So we'll see.” – Bret Baier.

WITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote that “Happiness is a butterfly, which when pursued, is always just beyond your grasp, but which, if you will sit down quietly, may alight upon you.” But what are we supposed to do while waiting for the monarchs of joy to touch down? Arthur Brooks tells us: Get busy and make something. The head of the American Enterprise Institute shares A Formula for Happiness: “Social scientists have caught the butterfly. After 40 years of research, they attribute happiness to three major sources: genes, events and values… relieving poverty brings big happiness, but income, per se, does not. Even after accounting for government transfers that support personal finances, unemployment proves catastrophic for happiness… Work can bring happiness by marrying our passions to our skills, empowering us to create value in our lives and in the lives of others.”

[Yeah, yeah, I know it was in Sunday’s paper. But people with small children don’t get to loll about reading the Sunday Times and sipping caramel macchiatos, all right.]

POLL CHECK - Real Clear Politics Averages

Obama Job Approval: Approve – 42.5 percent//Disapprove – 53.4 percent

Direction of Country: Right Direction – 30.0 percent//Wrong Track – 63.5 percent

HAWKEYES HAPPY WITH RYAN - While Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is facing backlash from some conservatives over his budget deal, he is not drawing the ire of Iowans. A Des Moines Register poll shows the 2012 vice presidential nominee with the highest approval rating of potential 2016 contenders. Ryan holds a 73 percent approval rating among Iowa Republicans, followed by Fox News host and former Gov. Mike Huckabee, R-Ark.,at 66 percent, Rick Santorum with 58 percent, Gov. Rick Perry, R-Texas, holding 55 percent, and Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., garnering 51 percent approval. Only 10 percent disapproved of Ryan, with nearly 30 percent voicing disapproval of Christie.

Clinton cruising - The same survey showed 89 percent of those polled hold a favorable view of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, with only 7 percent disapproving. Vice President Joe Biden holds 71 percent popularity with Iowa voters. Similarly, nearly 70 percent were unfamiliar with former Gov. Brian Schweitzer, D-Mont., and Gov. Martin O’Malley, D-Md.

OBAMA FUNDRAISERS BOON FOR DEMS - The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee will release figures today touting its best off-year November fundraising ever. The group raised $5.1 million, with $48.6 million raised this year and $12 million in the bank. President Obama’s flurry of November fundraisers contributed to the uptick in support as 2014 shapes up to be an expensive race. Washington Examiner has more.

KING HAWKISH ON TEA PARTY ATTACKS - Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., is New Hampshire today to help local Republicans with their fundraising. He will also be testing the waters for his own 2016 bid. King has made nearly a half-dozen appearances in the first-in-the-nation primary state already this year. The Manchester Union Leader reports King will use the visit to launch a political action committee called, “American Leadership Now” that counters what he considers the Tea Party’s isolationist views.

Wait, isn’t he German? - House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan downplayed Speaker John Boehner’s harsh criticism of outside groups saying the Speaker “just got his Irish up” and that the Tea Party is “indispensable, invaluable in helping keep the taxpayer in the game, keeping Washington accountable.” Fox News has more.

federal_budget,Democracy Now,0,http://www.democracynow.org/2013/12/4/detroit_bankruptcy_wall_street_lost_revenues,"Detroit Bankruptcy: Wall Street, Lost Revenues Forced Decline, But City Pensioners to Pay the Costs",2013-12-04,,"This is a rush transcript . Copy may not be in its final form .
NERMEEN SHAIKH : We begin with Detroit , which has become the largest-ever U.S. municipality to qualify for bankruptcy . On Tuesday , Federal Judge Steven Rhodes ruled the city meets every criteria for insolvency , including failure to honor its debt obligations and inability to provide the bare minimum services to its 680,000 residents . This is Detroit ’ s mayor , Dave Bing , responding to the ruling .
MAYOR DAVE BING : Let me just say that the judge has spoken , and I do think it ’ s a tough day for all of us here in Detroit . I believe , since I came to office with the crisis that we had , this was inevitable . I don ’ t think anybody necessarily wanted to go in this direction , but now that we are here , it ’ s more important that we work together as opposed to continuing to fight each other .
AMY GOODMAN : That was Detroit Mayor Dave Bing . The bankruptcy ruling puts tens of thousands of retired city workers ’ pensions at risk , overriding protections in the state constitution . The city faces about $ 18 billion in debt , of which $ 3.5 billion is pension obligations . Detroit ’ s emergency manager , Kevyn Orr , has told public unions to brace for significant cuts but has not laid out details . General workers ’ pensions in Detroit average around $ 19,000 per year . Orr welcomed Tuesday ’ s bankruptcy ruling .
KEVYN ORR : We are gratified with the court ’ s ruling today regarding the city ’ s eligibility to pursue a plan of adjustment under Chapter 9 of the federal bankruptcy code . While we are very pleased , we remain very concerned about the need to adjust the city ’ s debt , to improve its level of services for its citizens , and to also prepare for the city to exit this receivership in a fashion that restores democracy to the city .
NERMEEN SHAIKH : That was Detroit ’ s emergency manager , Kevyn Orr . By the new year , Orr will present a , quote , “ plan of adjustment ” in bankruptcy court that will clarify how much pensions will be cut . The plan may also include a “ fire sale ” of city assets that could result in public utilities and the Detroit Institute of Arts collection being bartered off to private bidders . Detroit ’ s bankruptcy filing marks a grim milestone in the decline of what was once the country ’ s fourth-largest city , known as the Motor City , the birthplace of the middle class .
Opponents of Detroit declaring bankruptcy say the city failed to engage in good-faith negotiations with retirees and municipality workers . Emails from before Orr ’ s appointment reportedly suggest that bankruptcy was a foregone conclusion . The local chapter of the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees , or AFSCME , has already appealed the bankruptcy ruling in a bid to protect its union members ’ pensions and benefits .
AMY GOODMAN : Meanwhile , a new study says Detroit ’ s emergency manager may be exaggerating claims of an $ 18 billion debt while misplacing blame for the city ’ s fiscal woes . The progressive think tank Demos says Detroit ’ s problems stem not from its liabilities , from a decline , in fact , in public revenues and involvement in harmful Wall Street schemes .
To talk more about the crisis , we ’ re joined by the Demos report author , Wallace Turbeville , senior fellow at Demos and author of the report , “ The Detroit Bankruptcy. ” He ’ s formerly a vice president at Goldman Sachs in the municipal finance department .
And in Detroit we ’ re joined by Edward McNeil , who worked for the city of Detroit for 25 years as an arborist . He retired in '98 and now works for AFSCME Council 25 in Michigan , one of the union representatives currently bargaining for the rights of Detroit 's employees and retirees .
We welcome you both , Wallace Turbeville and Edward McNeil , to ███ ! Wallace Turbeville , can you explain to us what is it—who is responsible , who is responsible for Detroit ’ s woes ?
WALLACE TURBEVILLE : Detroit has several kinds of woes . Detroit has had some deep structural problems for many years : a declining population , a job market that ’ s been particularly susceptible to downturns in the economy , and a real decline in housing . Those structural issues have been going on for a long time . The other thing that ’ s happened—they ’ re related , but they ’ re different—is that it ran out of cash , ran out of cash this year . And when you talk about insolvencies of municipalities , bankruptcies of municipalities , it ’ s all about running out of cash . So they need to fix very important structural problems . They also need to get their checkbook balanced so that they ’ re actually—have money coming in that ’ s—that it covers the money that has to go out on an annual basis . So , that part is—what we find in the report is that part of it , the cash part of it , is overwhelmingly a function of a tremendous downturn in the revenues of the city , in the tax base of the city , and , importantly , money that the state collects in taxes and turns back to the city in terms of revenue sharing . That was a critical part of the problem .
AMY GOODMAN : The way the corporate media is portraying this , they say , you know , politicians , Republican and Democrat , they cave to unions , and so over the many , many years around the issue of pensions , for example , you know , they give in , in union negotiations , and so the unions are bringing this city down , Detroit known as a union city . You found something very different .
WALLACE TURBEVILLE : Oh , absolutely . First of all , something that happened five , 10 years ago , I ’ m not even—I don ’ t even comment on that . This is a battle of ideas and of words—the $ 18 billion number , bringing up things that happened years ago and saying it was a function of bad management and that ’ s what ’ s the problem now . No , the problem now : They ’ re out of cash . Those are two different things completely . But the point is that the facts don ’ t show , as we sit here today and as we look at the last five years , that any of that ’ s true . Thirty—the city cut—has cut its operating budget by 38 percent in the last five years in response to the Great Recession . So , the benefits—in the report we talk about the healthcare benefits , are very comparable to other cities . And if you—we ’ ve got that all laid out ; anybody who wants to go look can think of their own health insurance and whether it ’ s comparable . It is . The issue of pensions , $ 19,000 a year for non-uniformed employees , I have to ask : Does anybody think that ’ s excessive ? The figure is $ 30,000 for uniformed employees . If you look at—
WALLACE TURBEVILLE : Police and fire . If you look at that compared with , you know , every other city in the United States , it ’ s on the low end . So , there is no demonstrable evidence that this cash crisis has been caused by the expense side of the ledger , leaving aside some of the financial deals .
NERMEEN SHAIKH : So what is it , Wallace , about a municipal bankruptcy that people should understand ? First of all , how often is it the case that cities in the U.S. run out of money ? And what brought Detroit to this point ? And why is it that debt is being talked about rather than annual revenue ?
WALLACE TURBEVILLE : OK , let me do the last part first , why is debt being talked about , and let ’ s get that out of the way . $ 18 billion is a fantasy number . And I can explain—I can start the explanation by just saying one of the components of that is $ 5.8 billion of water and sewage revenue bonds . Those revenue bonds are for a system that ’ s not just Detroit ; it serves 40 percent of the population of the state of Michigan . That ’ s three million people . Detroit is 700,000 people . The emergency manager added that into the list . It has Detroit on the cover sheet . I mean , that ’ s what it says : Detroit . But the—that ’ s not debt of the city , and it isn ’ t paid from the budget of the city , and it ’ s for this broader enterprise . So , just as an example , the $ 18 billion number is a fantasy .
But , more importantly and more sort of centrally , the idea of some gross debt number being important is just not true . Municipalities have historically gone bankrupt infrequently . It ’ s getting more frequent because the recession . This is the backwash from the recession . And as property values crashed , property taxes , which are a fundamental revenue base for cities , went down , but there was a time period where that decline occurred . That didn ’ t happen all at once . Property values went down . Reassessments occur over time . Eventually , it hurts the cities . Cities—cities are all about cash—cash in , cash out . Now , a lot of debt can cause you to have to pay a lot of debt service , meaning your annual payment , but if you think about what happens to people , as long as you can pay your mortgage , you ’ re in good shape , and especially with municipalities who can tax and have access to states , and they have taxing power . It ’ s all about having the cash to go forward . So what ’ s happened to Detroit is , they ’ ve had a tremendous decline , a 20 percent decline in tax revenues since the Great Recession , and , again , this really unfortunate and possibly planned cutting of the state revenue sharing at the worst possible moment .
NERMEEN SHAIKH : But why is it—why focus on the $ 18 billion of debt , because it ’ s not obvious what declaring bankruptcy—who stands to gain from declaring bankruptcy ?
WALLACE TURBEVILLE : Oh , why focus on the $ 18 billion , I think that ’ s a marketing issue . I think—
WALLACE TURBEVILLE : Well , the emergency manager wants things to sound as dire as possible , because he was appointed by the state over—against the will of the people .
AMY GOODMAN : Now , explain what that emergency manager is and how he got chosen .
WALLACE TURBEVILLE : OK . The state of Michigan adopted a law . The state of Michigan—what happened is that the Legislature and governor became very right-wing in 2010 when there was a big sweep election . So what they did was they adopted a law that said that the governor could appoint an emergency manager for a city and basically become a dictator in that city for the duration of any financial crisis . And so that ’ s what ’ s happened . Mr. Orr is a—is the emergency manager . He ’ s a partner at a law firm called Jones Day . Jones Day is a Cleveland-based law firm . It ’ s been around for a thousand years . I ’ ve worked for them myself many times . Jones Day was also appointed a special counsel to the city . So I think it ’ s fair to say that not so much—
WALLACE TURBEVILLE : Well , it ’ s been argued as such , especially since some of the financial deals that were done , Bank of America was a central part of those financial deals , and Jones Day represents Bank of America . So , to resolve their contract—their conflict , they ’ ve been paid $ 16 million , so to—in this representation . So I think it ’ s fair to say that Jones Day is running Detroit . But Jones Day is running Detroit at the behest of the governor , Governor Snyder , who has an animosity towards Detroit for a number of reasons , I would say , and would like to see—would like to see the politics adjusted .
WALLACE TURBEVILLE : Well , Michigan went the way of the tea party . And Michigan has—you know , Detroit is the only large city , but there are other cities around it , which are largely old industrial cities and African-American cities , for the most part , and Democratic . So , there is this tension between the urban centers , which are—that have a lot of influence from trade unions , and the Republican rest of the state . So , it ’ s—from a political standpoint , it serves the interest of Governor Snyder and his party to actually undercut the role of trade unions , because they ’ re the ones that are institutions opposed to his political viewpoint .
The bankruptcy judge yesterday said—one of the issues that was raised was that basically the bankruptcy was a—the fix was in for it . In other words , the state did it as part of a plan that would restructure the politics . And the judge said , yes , there was evidence of that , actually , but , he said , not enough to actually make a ruling . Well , I don ’ t have—I don ’ t have to adhere to rules of evidence from the court . I ’ m more of the view that if it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck , it ’ s a duck . And if you watch the series of events , first the emergency manager statute that gave him the right to create a dictator in a city—and they ’ ve done that in several cities now—by the way , that was pulled back by referendum , so the people of the state of Michigan voted to eliminate that statute , then the state Legislature came back and re-enacted it , basically . So , it ’ s not a—it ’ s not a popular statute . But , anyway , the idea is , have the power to create the emergency manager , create a situation where Detroit has a very hard time keeping its revenues up during this recessionary period , when every—when it ’ s being starved of cash because of property taxes and income taxes and all the rest . Then , at the last minute , cut revenue sharing , and it ’ s starting to look like the whole idea was to push Detroit over the edge in order to have this bankruptcy to restructure .
NERMEEN SHAIKH : But one of the things that your report , the Demos report , “ The Detroit Bankruptcy , ” of which you ’ re the author , points out is that the financial crisis in Detroit was exacerbated by complicated Wall Street deals that put its ability to pay its expenses at even greater risk . So could you explain what the role of Wall Street was in making the crisis worse ?
WALLACE TURBEVILLE : Yes . The—in 2005 and 2006 , the city , like many cities and states around the country , felt compelled to issue debt to put money into its pension fund . The idea is you borrow the money , you put it in the pension fund , and , let ’ s say , you can hold it for 30 years and invest it in the stock market ; the interest on the debt that you take out is less than the earnings you ’ re going to get on shares of stock . Whether that ’ s wise or not , I won ’ t comment , but it ’ s been done . It was done many , many places . So , they issued $ 1.6 billion of debt . For half of that , they did it in combination with a derivative . Derivative , you might recall , was the large reason for the financial crisis in 2008 . AIG comes to mind , if everybody remembers that , $ 180 billion in losses that drove the largest insurance company in the world out of business , or at least into receivership and into bailout . So what happened was they talked the city of Detroit into doing this derivative . And the way it worked is , for half , or $ 800 million , of this financing , it ’ s as if you took out a mortgage , borrowed money , and you paid your principal to one bank and the interest to the other bank .
On this interest part of the deal , they had a term in it that if Detroit was nicked just one credit rating down , the bank could ask for all of the interest for 25 years that was to become due—they could ask for it now . Now , the city of Detroit had been—I worked in the city of Detroit as a banker at Goldman in 1990 to keep them from getting downgraded , and we successfully managed that , to do the financing to do that . City of Detroit has been on the edge of investment grade , non-investment grade for decades . So , to do that transaction in 2005 and 2006 and include a term which says all of your interest for 20 years is due now if you get downgraded was just imprudent beyond imagination . I ’ ve never seen anything like it . And indeed , of course , that ’ s what happened . And so , one of the major issues under discussion right now is that the banks have come and said , “ I want my interest now. ” And the question is whether that ’ s going to be adjusted by the bankruptcy court , whether it ’ s negotiated some other way . Right now the emergency manager has shown no inclination to negotiate that as strongly as I think it should be , frankly .
AMY GOODMAN : Wallace Turbeville , what are the recommendations of your report ?
WALLACE TURBEVILLE : I have the happy role of not having to actually implement anything , so I can think widely about what should be done . I think one of the things—right now they have a cash shortfall , according to the emergency manager , of about $ 200 million a year . First of all , I think that ’ s inflated . As part of the whole thing of that $ 18 billion pushing up how dire things are , the emergency manager inflated what the unfunded part of the pension liability is—that is , the future liabilities to pay pensions to people—what do you have to put aside to cover that , what the city has to put aside . And then—so you get a number like that , and you say , “ How many years do you pay it off ? ” And so , what the emergency manager has done is calculated a number that ’ s very , very large , using assumptions that are not typical , and then said , “ Pay it off really quick , ” which means that the cash demand on the city is very , very high . That ’ s a little bit like the whole $ 18 billion thing—make it as bad as possible . So , one thing is to address the pension liability issue and the funding of it in a way that actually is practical and would work , that would reduce the $ 200 million gap .
The second thing is to collect taxes better . They have a serious problem of so-called reverse commuter income taxes , meaning people who live inside the city of Detroit , work outside , they ’ re supposed to pay income taxes , but they don ’ t properly track that , that you ’ re actually making money outside the city . That ’ s easily tracked . You just get on the database for federal income taxes . That ’ s an important thing .
But I think , most importantly , that what should happen , and what should have happened before this bankruptcy was ever filed , is that the state of Michigan has to recognize that they are both responsible at a certain level and also it ’ s in their interest—it ’ s in the interest of the entire state to increase the revenues of the city of Detroit over a period of time . So , revenues have to be pumped up .
AMY GOODMAN : Well , Wallace Turbeville , I want to thank you very much for being with us . And we ’ re sorry we weren ’ t able to go to Detroit ; our guest there didn ’ t show up .

NERMEEN SHAIKH: We begin with Detroit, which has become the largest-ever U.S. municipality to qualify for bankruptcy. On Tuesday, Federal Judge Steven Rhodes ruled the city meets every criteria for insolvency, including failure to honor its debt obligations and inability to provide the bare minimum services to its 680,000 residents. This is Detroit’s mayor, Dave Bing, responding to the ruling.

MAYOR DAVE BING: Let me just say that the judge has spoken, and I do think it’s a tough day for all of us here in Detroit. I believe, since I came to office with the crisis that we had, this was inevitable. I don’t think anybody necessarily wanted to go in this direction, but now that we are here, it’s more important that we work together as opposed to continuing to fight each other.

AMY GOODMAN: That was Detroit Mayor Dave Bing. The bankruptcy ruling puts tens of thousands of retired city workers’ pensions at risk, overriding protections in the state constitution. The city faces about $18 billion in debt, of which $3.5 billion is pension obligations. Detroit’s emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, has told public unions to brace for significant cuts but has not laid out details. General workers’ pensions in Detroit average around $19,000 per year. Orr welcomed Tuesday’s bankruptcy ruling.

KEVYN ORR: We are gratified with the court’s ruling today regarding the city’s eligibility to pursue a plan of adjustment under Chapter 9 of the federal bankruptcy code. While we are very pleased, we remain very concerned about the need to adjust the city’s debt, to improve its level of services for its citizens, and to also prepare for the city to exit this receivership in a fashion that restores democracy to the city.

NERMEEN SHAIKH: That was Detroit’s emergency manager, Kevyn Orr. By the new year, Orr will present a, quote, “plan of adjustment” in bankruptcy court that will clarify how much pensions will be cut. The plan may also include a “fire sale” of city assets that could result in public utilities and the Detroit Institute of Arts collection being bartered off to private bidders. Detroit’s bankruptcy filing marks a grim milestone in the decline of what was once the country’s fourth-largest city, known as the Motor City, the birthplace of the middle class.

Opponents of Detroit declaring bankruptcy say the city failed to engage in good-faith negotiations with retirees and municipality workers. Emails from before Orr’s appointment reportedly suggest that bankruptcy was a foregone conclusion. The local chapter of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, or AFSCME, has already appealed the bankruptcy ruling in a bid to protect its union members’ pensions and benefits.

AMY GOODMAN: Meanwhile, a new study says Detroit’s emergency manager may be exaggerating claims of an $18 billion debt while misplacing blame for the city’s fiscal woes. The progressive think tank Demos says Detroit’s problems stem not from its liabilities, from a decline, in fact, in public revenues and involvement in harmful Wall Street schemes.

To talk more about the crisis, we’re joined by the Demos report author, Wallace Turbeville, senior fellow at Demos and author of the report, “The Detroit Bankruptcy.” He’s formerly a vice president at Goldman Sachs in the municipal finance department.

And in Detroit we’re joined by Edward McNeil, who worked for the city of Detroit for 25 years as an arborist. He retired in '98 and now works for AFSCME Council 25 in Michigan, one of the union representatives currently bargaining for the rights of Detroit's employees and retirees.

We welcome you both, Wallace Turbeville and Edward McNeil, to Democracy Now! Wallace Turbeville, can you explain to us what is it—who is responsible, who is responsible for Detroit’s woes?

WALLACE TURBEVILLE: Detroit has several kinds of woes. Detroit has had some deep structural problems for many years: a declining population, a job market that’s been particularly susceptible to downturns in the economy, and a real decline in housing. Those structural issues have been going on for a long time. The other thing that’s happened—they’re related, but they’re different—is that it ran out of cash, ran out of cash this year. And when you talk about insolvencies of municipalities, bankruptcies of municipalities, it’s all about running out of cash. So they need to fix very important structural problems. They also need to get their checkbook balanced so that they’re actually—have money coming in that’s—that it covers the money that has to go out on an annual basis. So, that part is—what we find in the report is that part of it, the cash part of it, is overwhelmingly a function of a tremendous downturn in the revenues of the city, in the tax base of the city, and, importantly, money that the state collects in taxes and turns back to the city in terms of revenue sharing. That was a critical part of the problem.

AMY GOODMAN: The way the corporate media is portraying this, they say, you know, politicians, Republican and Democrat, they cave to unions, and so over the many, many years around the issue of pensions, for example, you know, they give in, in union negotiations, and so the unions are bringing this city down, Detroit known as a union city. You found something very different.

WALLACE TURBEVILLE: Oh, absolutely. First of all, something that happened five, 10 years ago, I’m not even—I don’t even comment on that. This is a battle of ideas and of words—the $18 billion number, bringing up things that happened years ago and saying it was a function of bad management and that’s what’s the problem now. No, the problem now: They’re out of cash. Those are two different things completely. But the point is that the facts don’t show, as we sit here today and as we look at the last five years, that any of that’s true. Thirty—the city cut—has cut its operating budget by 38 percent in the last five years in response to the Great Recession. So, the benefits—in the report we talk about the healthcare benefits, are very comparable to other cities. And if you—we’ve got that all laid out; anybody who wants to go look can think of their own health insurance and whether it’s comparable. It is. The issue of pensions, $19,000 a year for non-uniformed employees, I have to ask: Does anybody think that’s excessive? The figure is $30,000 for uniformed employees. If you look at—

AMY GOODMAN: Police, firefighters.

WALLACE TURBEVILLE: Police and fire. If you look at that compared with, you know, every other city in the United States, it’s on the low end. So, there is no demonstrable evidence that this cash crisis has been caused by the expense side of the ledger, leaving aside some of the financial deals.

NERMEEN SHAIKH: So what is it, Wallace, about a municipal bankruptcy that people should understand? First of all, how often is it the case that cities in the U.S. run out of money? And what brought Detroit to this point? And why is it that debt is being talked about rather than annual revenue?

WALLACE TURBEVILLE: OK, let me do the last part first, why is debt being talked about, and let’s get that out of the way. $18 billion is a fantasy number. And I can explain—I can start the explanation by just saying one of the components of that is $5.8 billion of water and sewage revenue bonds. Those revenue bonds are for a system that’s not just Detroit; it serves 40 percent of the population of the state of Michigan. That’s three million people. Detroit is 700,000 people. The emergency manager added that into the list. It has Detroit on the cover sheet. I mean, that’s what it says: Detroit. But the—that’s not debt of the city, and it isn’t paid from the budget of the city, and it’s for this broader enterprise. So, just as an example, the $18 billion number is a fantasy.

But, more importantly and more sort of centrally, the idea of some gross debt number being important is just not true. Municipalities have historically gone bankrupt infrequently. It’s getting more frequent because the recession. This is the backwash from the recession. And as property values crashed, property taxes, which are a fundamental revenue base for cities, went down, but there was a time period where that decline occurred. That didn’t happen all at once. Property values went down. Reassessments occur over time. Eventually, it hurts the cities. Cities—cities are all about cash—cash in, cash out. Now, a lot of debt can cause you to have to pay a lot of debt service, meaning your annual payment, but if you think about what happens to people, as long as you can pay your mortgage, you’re in good shape, and especially with municipalities who can tax and have access to states, and they have taxing power. It’s all about having the cash to go forward. So what’s happened to Detroit is, they’ve had a tremendous decline, a 20 percent decline in tax revenues since the Great Recession, and, again, this really unfortunate and possibly planned cutting of the state revenue sharing at the worst possible moment.

NERMEEN SHAIKH: But why is it—why focus on the $18 billion of debt, because it’s not obvious what declaring bankruptcy—who stands to gain from declaring bankruptcy?

WALLACE TURBEVILLE: Oh, why focus on the $18 billion, I think that’s a marketing issue. I think—

NERMEEN SHAIKH: Marketing to what end?

WALLACE TURBEVILLE: Well, the emergency manager wants things to sound as dire as possible, because he was appointed by the state over—against the will of the people.

AMY GOODMAN: Now, explain what that emergency manager is and how he got chosen.

WALLACE TURBEVILLE: OK. The state of Michigan adopted a law. The state of Michigan—what happened is that the Legislature and governor became very right-wing in 2010 when there was a big sweep election. So what they did was they adopted a law that said that the governor could appoint an emergency manager for a city and basically become a dictator in that city for the duration of any financial crisis. And so that’s what’s happened. Mr. Orr is a—is the emergency manager. He’s a partner at a law firm called Jones Day. Jones Day is a Cleveland-based law firm. It’s been around for a thousand years. I’ve worked for them myself many times. Jones Day was also appointed a special counsel to the city. So I think it’s fair to say that not so much—

NERMEEN SHAIKH: Wasn’t that a conflict of interest?

WALLACE TURBEVILLE: Well, it’s been argued as such, especially since some of the financial deals that were done, Bank of America was a central part of those financial deals, and Jones Day represents Bank of America. So, to resolve their contract—their conflict, they’ve been paid $16 million, so to—in this representation. So I think it’s fair to say that Jones Day is running Detroit. But Jones Day is running Detroit at the behest of the governor, Governor Snyder, who has an animosity towards Detroit for a number of reasons, I would say, and would like to see—would like to see the politics adjusted.

AMY GOODMAN: Explain why.

WALLACE TURBEVILLE: Well, Michigan went the way of the tea party. And Michigan has—you know, Detroit is the only large city, but there are other cities around it, which are largely old industrial cities and African-American cities, for the most part, and Democratic. So, there is this tension between the urban centers, which are—that have a lot of influence from trade unions, and the Republican rest of the state. So, it’s—from a political standpoint, it serves the interest of Governor Snyder and his party to actually undercut the role of trade unions, because they’re the ones that are institutions opposed to his political viewpoint.

The bankruptcy judge yesterday said—one of the issues that was raised was that basically the bankruptcy was a—the fix was in for it. In other words, the state did it as part of a plan that would restructure the politics. And the judge said, yes, there was evidence of that, actually, but, he said, not enough to actually make a ruling. Well, I don’t have—I don’t have to adhere to rules of evidence from the court. I’m more of the view that if it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck, it’s a duck. And if you watch the series of events, first the emergency manager statute that gave him the right to create a dictator in a city—and they’ve done that in several cities now—by the way, that was pulled back by referendum, so the people of the state of Michigan voted to eliminate that statute, then the state Legislature came back and re-enacted it, basically. So, it’s not a—it’s not a popular statute. But, anyway, the idea is, have the power to create the emergency manager, create a situation where Detroit has a very hard time keeping its revenues up during this recessionary period, when every—when it’s being starved of cash because of property taxes and income taxes and all the rest. Then, at the last minute, cut revenue sharing, and it’s starting to look like the whole idea was to push Detroit over the edge in order to have this bankruptcy to restructure.

NERMEEN SHAIKH: But one of the things that your report, the Demos report, “The Detroit Bankruptcy,” of which you’re the author, points out is that the financial crisis in Detroit was exacerbated by complicated Wall Street deals that put its ability to pay its expenses at even greater risk. So could you explain what the role of Wall Street was in making the crisis worse?

WALLACE TURBEVILLE: Yes. The—in 2005 and 2006, the city, like many cities and states around the country, felt compelled to issue debt to put money into its pension fund. The idea is you borrow the money, you put it in the pension fund, and, let’s say, you can hold it for 30 years and invest it in the stock market; the interest on the debt that you take out is less than the earnings you’re going to get on shares of stock. Whether that’s wise or not, I won’t comment, but it’s been done. It was done many, many places. So, they issued $1.6 billion of debt. For half of that, they did it in combination with a derivative. Derivative, you might recall, was the large reason for the financial crisis in 2008. AIG comes to mind, if everybody remembers that, $180 billion in losses that drove the largest insurance company in the world out of business, or at least into receivership and into bailout. So what happened was they talked the city of Detroit into doing this derivative. And the way it worked is, for half, or $800 million, of this financing, it’s as if you took out a mortgage, borrowed money, and you paid your principal to one bank and the interest to the other bank.

On this interest part of the deal, they had a term in it that if Detroit was nicked just one credit rating down, the bank could ask for all of the interest for 25 years that was to become due—they could ask for it now. Now, the city of Detroit had been—I worked in the city of Detroit as a banker at Goldman in 1990 to keep them from getting downgraded, and we successfully managed that, to do the financing to do that. City of Detroit has been on the edge of investment grade, non-investment grade for decades. So, to do that transaction in 2005 and 2006 and include a term which says all of your interest for 20 years is due now if you get downgraded was just imprudent beyond imagination. I’ve never seen anything like it. And indeed, of course, that’s what happened. And so, one of the major issues under discussion right now is that the banks have come and said, “I want my interest now.” And the question is whether that’s going to be adjusted by the bankruptcy court, whether it’s negotiated some other way. Right now the emergency manager has shown no inclination to negotiate that as strongly as I think it should be, frankly.

AMY GOODMAN: Wallace Turbeville, what are the recommendations of your report?

WALLACE TURBEVILLE: I have the happy role of not having to actually implement anything, so I can think widely about what should be done. I think one of the things—right now they have a cash shortfall, according to the emergency manager, of about $200 million a year. First of all, I think that’s inflated. As part of the whole thing of that $18 billion pushing up how dire things are, the emergency manager inflated what the unfunded part of the pension liability is—that is, the future liabilities to pay pensions to people—what do you have to put aside to cover that, what the city has to put aside. And then—so you get a number like that, and you say, “How many years do you pay it off?” And so, what the emergency manager has done is calculated a number that’s very, very large, using assumptions that are not typical, and then said, “Pay it off really quick,” which means that the cash demand on the city is very, very high. That’s a little bit like the whole $18 billion thing—make it as bad as possible. So, one thing is to address the pension liability issue and the funding of it in a way that actually is practical and would work, that would reduce the $200 million gap.

The second thing is to collect taxes better. They have a serious problem of so-called reverse commuter income taxes, meaning people who live inside the city of Detroit, work outside, they’re supposed to pay income taxes, but they don’t properly track that, that you’re actually making money outside the city. That’s easily tracked. You just get on the database for federal income taxes. That’s an important thing.

But I think, most importantly, that what should happen, and what should have happened before this bankruptcy was ever filed, is that the state of Michigan has to recognize that they are both responsible at a certain level and also it’s in their interest—it’s in the interest of the entire state to increase the revenues of the city of Detroit over a period of time. So, revenues have to be pumped up.

Ted Cruz , the tea party darling from Texas who led the way to last year ’ s partial government shutdown .

Wanting to prove that Republicans can govern , Boehner has promised no more shutdowns – even as he has worked to accommodate hard-liners . Last week , for instance , the GOP leadership brought a symbolic bill to the floor that declared the president ’ s executive immigration action null and void . The legislation had no future with a Democratic Senate and Democratic president to block it .
The budget bill , too , takes on the president , but not in the way that hard-liners wanted . By funding the Department of Homeland Security – which administers the president ’ s immigration executive action – only through Feb. 27 , the GOP has set up a showdown over immigration for early in the new year . The right flank wanted that fight now .
Since their wave election in 2010 , tea partiers have pushed back against the GOP leadership , earning them the nickname , the “ hell no ” caucus . They ’ ve rattled markets and the public by refusing to increase the debt limit . Last year , they led the way to a partial government shutdown over funding for the Affordable Care Act .
But when the new Congress convenes on Jan. 6 , the speaker will have a bigger “ buffer ” against his right flank as a result of the midterms , which have given House Republicans their largest majority in more than 80 years – 247 seats if a recount in Arizona goes their way .
“ The tea party element was marginally strengthened , but Boehner did succeed in winning a larger buffer ; now he can afford to lose around 29 Republicans instead of 16 , ” says Dave Wasserman , of the Cook Political Report , in an e-mail .

This group would also be the first ones punished in any backlash against a GOP-run Congress in 2016 , “ so you can bet they will want to avoid truly destructive showdowns with the president , ” Mr. Kyle adds .
But not everyone believes Boehner will have an easier time of it in the next Congress .
For instance , there ’ s a danger in promising House hard-liners greater success when the Senate comes under GOP control next year , says Norman Ornstein , a longtime political observer with the American Enterprise Institute in Washington . Democrats such as Sen. Warren will still be able to use the filibuster to block legislation , and of course , the president has his veto pen .

Mr. Ornstein says it may also be harder for Boehner to keep his right flank under control , despite the buffer . More members mean more people who can say no – and point to the other guy to provide a yes vote . And if Boehner leans too far toward the “ blue ” GOP caucus or has to rely on Democrats for votes – as he did Thursday – that will further anger the hard-liners .
“ How many get-out-of-jail-free cards can you use ? ” Mr. Ornstein asks .","Getting a budget over the finish line was one tough slog for House Speaker John Boehner (R) of Ohio on Thursday.

This group would also be the first ones punished in any backlash against a GOP-run Congress in 2016, “so you can bet they will want to avoid truly destructive showdowns with the president,” Mr. Kyle adds.

But not everyone believes Boehner will have an easier time of it in the next Congress.

For instance, there’s a danger in promising House hard-liners greater success when the Senate comes under GOP control next year, says Norman Ornstein, a longtime political observer with the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. Democrats such as Sen. Warren will still be able to use the filibuster to block legislation, and of course, the president has his veto pen.

Mr. Ornstein says it may also be harder for Boehner to keep his right flank under control, despite the buffer. More members mean more people who can say no – and point to the other guy to provide a yes vote. And if Boehner leans too far toward the “blue” GOP caucus or has to rely on Democrats for votes – as he did Thursday – that will further anger the hard-liners.

“How many get-out-of-jail-free cards can you use?” Mr. Ornstein asks.",www.csmonitor.com,center,Skv6vIQNdjYojTaw

Nearly three-quarters of that deficit reduction is in the form of spending cuts , while the remaining one-quarter comes from revenue increases . ( see Figure 1 ) As a result of that deficit reduction , the projected rise in debt levels from today through 2022 has decreased by nearly 10 full percentage points of gross domestic product . In fact , under today ’ s policies , debt levels in 2022—as a share of GDP—will be only slightly higher than they are expected to be by the end of next year . That doesn ’ t mean there is no more work to be done , but it does show we ’ ve come a long way already .
Congress has enacted several major pieces of legislation since the start of the 2011 fiscal year that will reduce future budget deficits relative to what they would have been had we continued forward under the policies in place before the enactment of those bills . The first of these deficit-reducing bills were the continuing resolutions passed between September 30 and December 21 , 2010 . Those bills provided temporary funding for a wide swath of government services and programs , but they did so at a lower level than funding had been for the previous year , after adjusting for inflation . Because the Congressional Budget Office assumes that this type of spending—known as discretionary spending—will increase each year with inflation , those first temporary appropriations bills in 2011 cut the Congressional Budget Office ’ s projection of discretionary spending from 2013 through 2022 by more than $ 400 billion .
The last temporary appropriations bill passed in December 2010 ran out on March 4 , 2011 . The new Congress then enacted several more temporary bills , and finally , on April 15 , 2011 , passed a full appropriations bill for the remainder of the 2011 fiscal year . This second half of the appropriations process also cut a substantial amount of spending . Each new appropriations bill passed by the new Congress cut funding even more than the first set had . The result was another approximately $ 180 billion in spending reductions over the 10-year period . Altogether , the fiscal year 2011 appropriations process reduced future discretionary spending by $ 585 billion , or about 4.3 percent .
Over the subsequent several months , Congress engaged in a protracted debate over the looming debt limit . The result of that debate was a bill titled the Budget Control Act . The act—also known as the debt-limit deal—reduced spending again . It did so mainly by setting caps on the overall amount of discretionary resources that Congress could allocate each year for the next decade . These caps were set even lower than the just-enacted , inflation-adjusted 2011 levels . So after already cutting spending several times to the tune of more than $ 500 billion , the Budget Control Act cut spending again—this time by approximately $ 860 billion . Together , the fiscal year 2011 appropriations process and the Budget Control Act are responsible for nearly $ 1.5 trillion in discretionary spending cuts . This is a whopping 10.6 percent reduction from inflation-adjusted 2010 spending levels .
All these direct programmatic spending cuts also have a secondary spending effect on the budget deficit . Reducing the deficit—either through spending cuts or revenue increases—allows the federal government to incur less debt , which in turn means that there will be less interest to pay back to lenders . In this case , that $ 1.5 trillion in spending cuts will also result in about $ 200 billion in reduced spending on interest payments .
In addition to the discretionary spending caps , the Budget Control Act set up a second process whereby a special congressional committee , known as the “ super committee , ” was tasked with finding an additional $ 1.2 trillion to $ 1.5 trillion in deficit reduction . If this “ super committee ” failed—which it ultimately did—a set of deliberately draconian spending cuts totaling approximately $ 1.2 trillion would be automatically triggered . Known as the “ sequester , ” those cuts were intended to be so damaging that Congress would work together to find a better way to reduce the deficit . Because Congress didn ’ t do that , however , the sequester was triggered and was set to kick in at the beginning of 2013 .
The beginning of 2013 also happened to be the deadline for dealing with the expiring Bush tax cuts , as well as a number of other expiring tax and spending provisions . The combination of all these fiscal deadlines became known as the “ fiscal cliff. ” And the resolution of the fiscal cliff resulted in yet more deficit reduction .
The American Taxpayer Relief Act—the bill passed by Congress and signed by the president to avoid much of the fiscal cliff—extended most of the Bush tax cuts but allowed those that affected only households with incomes of more than $ 450,000 to expire , resulting in a 10-year revenue increase of a little more than $ 600 billion .
The bill also included a number of other deficit-reducing measures . It paid , with offsetting spending reductions , for a one-year patch of the Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate—a formula that , if left unfixed , results in very large cuts to Medicare doctors ’ pay . Since most projections of the future budget deficit assume that Congress will continue to patch the Sustainable Growth Rate without paying for it , the American Taxpayer Relief Act reduces those future deficits by actually offsetting the cost this time .
Similarly , the fiscal cliff deal temporarily postponed the sequester , paying for it with offsetting spending cuts and revenue increases . As with the Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate , projections of future deficits assume that the sequester will not go into effect . Postponing the sequester without paying for it , therefore , wouldn ’ t increase the future deficit since projections already assume Congress will postpone it . But by paying for the delay , the future deficit actually becomes smaller than we expected .
Several questions remain regarding the rest of the sequester , however : Will it eventually go into effect ? If not , will its repeal be paid for ? If so , how will it be paid for ? These questions will determine if even more deficit reduction ultimately comes out of the Budget Control Act and the American Taxpayer Relief Act . Since those questions are as yet unanswered , the effects of the remaining sequester are not included in this analysis .
Altogether , the American Taxpayer Relief Act will reduce deficits over the next 10 years by about $ 750 billion . Of that deficit reduction , approximately $ 630 billion comes from revenue increases , approximately $ 30 billion comes from programmatic spending cuts , and the rest comes from interest savings resulting from lower deficits . ( see Figure 3 )
So where does all this deficit reduction leave us ? Since the start of fiscal year 2011 , Congress and the president have cut about $ 1.5 trillion in programmatic spending , raised about $ 630 billion in new revenue , and generated about $ 300 billion in interest savings , for a combined total of more than $ 2.4 trillion in deficit reduction . The result is a substantial cut in how much publicly held debt the country is expected to hold 10 years from now . Instead of reaching nearly 93 percent of GDP , debt is now projected to total about 83 percent of GDP—fully 10 points lower . And while that won ’ t be enough to finally put the budget onto sustainable footing , it is a massive improvement . In fact , it ’ s about two-thirds of the way toward stabilizing the debt-to-GDP ratio .
It ’ s been a bumpy few fiscal years . But don ’ t let all the twists and turns obscure the simple fact that we actually have accomplished a significant amount of deficit reduction along the way . Three-quarters of that deficit reduction has been achieved through spending cuts totaling $ 1.8 trillion , with only one-quarter coming from revenue increases .

federal_budget,Washington Times,2,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/mar/10/larry-kudlow-white-house-economic-adviser-foresees/,White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow foresees another budget fight over border wall,2019-03-10,David Sherfinski,"Larry Kudlow , a top White House economic adviser , said President Trump ’ s “ tough ” 2020 budget blueprint , due out Monday , could trigger a new fight over the his desired U.S.-Mexico border wall .
The 2020 budget blueprint will include at least $ 8.6 billion in border wall money , a senior administration official said Sunday . About $ 5 billion is slated to come from the Department of Homeland Security , with $ 3.6 billion coming from military construction funds .
“ I suppose there will be ” another budget fight over the wall , Mr. Kudlow said on “ Fox News Sunday . ”
“ I would just say that the whole issue of the wall and border security is of paramount importance , ” Mr. Kudlow said . “ We have a crisis down there . I think the president has made that case very effectively . ”
A standoff over border wall money helped precipitate the recent five-week government shutdown , and Mr. Trump recently declared a national emergency on the southern border the administration says will open up more funding for wall construction .
The administration recently outlined roughly $ 8.1 billion in other immediate funding for the wall , which includes nearly $ 1.4 billion in a recent spending bill , as well as $ 600 million from asset forfeitures , $ 2.5 billion from Defense Department counter-narcotics funds , and $ 3.6 billion from military construction money .

The 2020 budget blueprint will include at least $8.6 billion in border wall money, a senior administration official said Sunday. About $5 billion is slated to come from the Department of Homeland Security, with $3.6 billion coming from military construction funds.

“I suppose there will be” another budget fight over the wall, Mr. Kudlow said on “Fox News Sunday.”

“I would just say that the whole issue of the wall and border security is of paramount importance,” Mr. Kudlow said. “We have a crisis down there. I think the president has made that case very effectively.”

A standoff over border wall money helped precipitate the recent five-week government shutdown, and Mr. Trump recently declared a national emergency on the southern border the administration says will open up more funding for wall construction.

The administration recently outlined roughly $8.1 billion in other immediate funding for the wall, which includes nearly $1.4 billion in a recent spending bill, as well as $600 million from asset forfeitures, $2.5 billion from Defense Department counter-narcotics funds, and $3.6 billion from military construction money.

The House recently passed a resolution disapproving of the president’s emergency declaration, which would affect the military construction money, though the resolution is unlikely to survive a presidential veto if the Senate follows suit.

The president is proposing a 5 percent cut for domestic discretionary spending, while at the same time calling for a boost for the Defense Department, to $750 billion next year.

On the defense side, the president plans to park about $174 billion in a special overseas fund that isn’t subject to strict spending caps that Congress has lived under since 2011 — a move that congressional Democrats have rejected as a gimmick.

“It will be a tough budget,” Mr. Kudlow said. “Some of these recent budgets have not been favorable toward spending.”

The budget is projected to balance over 15 years and projects that the economy will grow on average by about 3 percent over the next decade, the senior administration official said.

The Treasury Department recently reported that the federal government ran a $310 billion budget deficit for the first four months of fiscal 2019 — a 77 percent increase from a year earlier.

Mr. Kudlow said he’s not terribly concerned about budget deficits at the moment as long as the administration can keep public debt-to-GDP ratios at a reasonable level.

“I don’t think good growth policies have to obsess necessarily about the budget deficits and so forth,” Mr. Kudlow said. “The economy is $20 trillion and net worth today, household net worth is about $100 trillion. So I don’t think that’s a burden on the economy.”

He said if the markets were overly concerned about deficits, there would be more of an effect on interest rates.

“I don’t see it right now,” he said. “And again, long run, we do want to reduce the burden of spending and borrowing, absolutely, but always as a share of GDP.”

BATTLEGROUND

Appropriations bills in Congress are the lifeblood of Washington policymakers, providing the money to carry out their priorities.

Over the past several months, appropriations bills to fund an array of federal programs have been the battleground in which Trump and Congress fought over the future of young people brought to the country illegally as children.

That six-month skirmish ended last month with Congress unable to legislate new protection from deportation for 700,000 “Dreamers” after Trump ended an Obama-era program giving them temporary legal status. At one point, the standoff forced Washington into a three-day government shutdown in January when funding ran out.

This time, Republicans hope to get enough money to hire 500 more Customs and Border Protection agents and 1,000 more Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. That would be the start of an eventual increase of CBP’s workforce by 5,000 and ICE’s by 10,000.

Democrats have noted that the agencies are falling short in filling all positions Congress already has authorized.

Negotiators are expected to work through the weekend as House of Representatives leaders hope to unveil a bill early next week so it can be debated on the House floor by midweek, with a Senate vote by the March 23 deadline.

A `` Park Closed '' sign is seen at an entrance to Liberty State Park during a partial state government shutdown in Jersey City , New Jersey U.S. , July 3 , 2017 . ███/Brendan McDermid
In Maine , a bipartisan budget committee met in Augusta in hopes of breaking a stalemate between Republican Governor Paul LePage and Democratic lawmakers . The shutdown came after LePage threatened to veto a compromise reached by lawmakers in the state ’ s $ 7.055 billion , two-year budget .
At New Jersey ’ s statehouse in Trenton , there was little evidence of progress in resolving a fight over a health insurance bill that Republican Governor Chris Christie said must be passed alongside the state ’ s budget .
Maine state police , parks and all offices responsible for collecting revenue planned to operate during the shutdown , the state ’ s first since 1991 , but the majority of 12,000 state employees will be furloughed .
New Jersey residents were not so lucky . With the July 4 holiday weekend in full swing , the shutdown there included the closure of Island State Beach Park , one of New Jersey ’ s few free public beaches , and all other state parks .
Although he beach park was closed to the public , Christie took a state helicopter on Saturday to a gubernatorial residence there to be with family and said he would go back on Sunday night .
“ That ’ s just the way it goes . Run for governor , and you have can have a residence there , ” he said when pressed on the issue .
At a news conference on Sunday afternoon , the governor said he had not spoken since Friday to Democratic holdouts .
The impasse could mean a furlough for 30,000 to 35,000 state employees on Monday .
In Maine , the stalled budget proposal would have repealed a measure voters approved in November for a 3 percent income tax hike on residents earning more than $ 200,000 a year . It also contained a 1.5 percent increase in the lodging tax , while increasing funding for public education by $ 162 million .
LePage has promised to veto any spending plan that raises taxes .
A six-member bipartisan House-Senate budget panel huddled into the evening on Sunday seeking to reach a deal that would win the two-thirds vote needed for passage of an emergency budget bill in both legislative chambers .
Mary-Erin Casale , a spokeswoman for Democratic House Speaker Sara Gideon , said a new compromise could be ready for a vote as early as Monday morning , about the time state employees planned to protest the shutdown at the capitol .
A spokeswoman for the governor could not be reached for comment on Sunday .
At the center of New Jersey ’ s stalemate was a plan by Christie to shake up the state ’ s largest health insurer , Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield , which he said lacked sufficient transparency and spent too much on salaries .
He threatened to cut $ 150 million in school funding and other items unless lawmakers adopt his proposal , which would redirect some of Horizon ’ s reserves to drug addiction treatment and other services .
Christie offered to hear Democrats ’ proposals for breaking the impasse , saying : “ It should end today , ” but acknowledged a settlement was unlikely so soon .

In Maine, a bipartisan budget committee met in Augusta in hopes of breaking a stalemate between Republican Governor Paul LePage and Democratic lawmakers. The shutdown came after LePage threatened to veto a compromise reached by lawmakers in the state’s $7.055 billion, two-year budget.

At New Jersey’s statehouse in Trenton, there was little evidence of progress in resolving a fight over a health insurance bill that Republican Governor Chris Christie said must be passed alongside the state’s budget.

Maine state police, parks and all offices responsible for collecting revenue planned to operate during the shutdown, the state’s first since 1991, but the majority of 12,000 state employees will be furloughed.

New Jersey residents were not so lucky. With the July 4 holiday weekend in full swing, the shutdown there included the closure of Island State Beach Park, one of New Jersey’s few free public beaches, and all other state parks.

Although he beach park was closed to the public, Christie took a state helicopter on Saturday to a gubernatorial residence there to be with family and said he would go back on Sunday night.

“That’s just the way it goes. Run for governor, and you have can have a residence there,” he said when pressed on the issue.

At a news conference on Sunday afternoon, the governor said he had not spoken since Friday to Democratic holdouts.

The impasse could mean a furlough for 30,000 to 35,000 state employees on Monday.

In Maine, the stalled budget proposal would have repealed a measure voters approved in November for a 3 percent income tax hike on residents earning more than $200,000 a year. It also contained a 1.5 percent increase in the lodging tax, while increasing funding for public education by $162 million.

LePage has promised to veto any spending plan that raises taxes.

A six-member bipartisan House-Senate budget panel huddled into the evening on Sunday seeking to reach a deal that would win the two-thirds vote needed for passage of an emergency budget bill in both legislative chambers.

Mary-Erin Casale, a spokeswoman for Democratic House Speaker Sara Gideon, said a new compromise could be ready for a vote as early as Monday morning, about the time state employees planned to protest the shutdown at the capitol.

A spokeswoman for the governor could not be reached for comment on Sunday.

HEALTH INSURANCE STALEMATE

At the center of New Jersey’s stalemate was a plan by Christie to shake up the state’s largest health insurer, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield, which he said lacked sufficient transparency and spent too much on salaries.

He threatened to cut $150 million in school funding and other items unless lawmakers adopt his proposal, which would redirect some of Horizon’s reserves to drug addiction treatment and other services.

Christie offered to hear Democrats’ proposals for breaking the impasse, saying: “It should end today,” but acknowledged a settlement was unlikely so soon.

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – Amid little progress in talks to end the partial government shutdown, President Donald Trump said Sunday he will continue to insist on billions for a U.S.-Mexico border wall – but is willing to settle for a steel structure rather than a concrete one.

""I informed my folks to say that we'll build a steel barrier,"" Trump told reporters after returning from a staff retreat at Camp David, casting the claim as a concession to Democrats. ""They don't like concrete, so we'll give them steel.""

Earlier in the day, as he left for Camp David, Trump described the budget battle as ""a very important battle to win,"" saying national security is at the heart of the shutdown as it passed its 16th day.

The shutdown hit a milestone on Sunday, tying for the third longest on record.

While Trump huddled with aides at Camp David, Vice President Mike Pence, other administration officials, and congressional staff members met at the White House complex for more negotiations to end the shutdown. There was no sign of a breakthrough.

""This shutdown could end tomorrow or it also could go on for a long time,"" Trump said.

Trump also repeated that he is considering some kind of national emergency declaration that would, in theory, allow him to use defense funds to start building a wall. ""We're looking at a national emergency because we have a national emergency,"" he said.

Democrats denounced Trump for both his wall demands and his talk of declaring an emergency.

""This would be a terrible use of department of defense dollars,” said Democratic Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the new chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, on ABC's ""This Week.""

Smith and other Democrats called on Trump to reopen the government and then negotiate border security, as well ""start paying our border patrol agents and the other 800,000 federal employees who are furloughed.""

He also told ABC: ""The president really doesn't understand the issue.""

With the parties unable to agree on a spending plan to fund about a quarter of the federal government, Trump is insisting on more than $5 billion for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border; Democrats, calling the wall expensive and impractical, want to reopen the government at least temporarily to provide space for more negotiations.

In speaking with reporters, Trump said he sympathizes with the hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have been furloughed or are working without pay, but they can ""adjust.""

On other issues, Trump:

Confirmed he will give his State of the Union address on Jan. 29, pursuant to an invitation sent Thursday by new House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.

Said he hopes to meet again soon with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un over his nuclear weapons program; Trump again claimed, with no evidence, that without his diplomacy the U.S. would be at war with Kim's nuclear-armed government.

Claimed he is still withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria, but won't necessarily do so ""quickly;"" earlier in the day, during a trip to Israel, National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. would not withdraw until Turkey pledges that it won't attack Kurdish forces in Syria.

Democrats called the idea of a physical barrier across the entire border expensive and ineffective, and said the solution involves more personnel and detection technology.

Now in control of the House, Democrats are focused a plan to reopen the government that would include temporary funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which handles border issues.

President Trump last year asked his cabinet members to find ways to cut their department budgets by 5 % , following news that the $ 1.5 trillion tax cut had contributed to a 17 % increase in the federal budget deficit in fiscal year 2018 , which ended Sept. 30 .
Republicans , however , weren ’ t able to advance Mr. Trump ’ s proposed cuts even though they controlled both chambers of Congress . Last year , they agreed to a bipartisan deal to boost government spending by $ 300 billion over two years above the limits set in 2011 .
That deal expires in October , and congressional leaders will now have to negotiate new overall spending levels for fiscal year 2020 , which starts Oct. 1 .

The negotiations will take place this year against a backdrop of rising government deficits that are set to top $ 1 trillion a year by 2022 , according to the Congressional Budget Office .
Federal outlays rose 4.4 % in the 2018 calendar year and government receipts declined 0.4 % , the Treasury Department said Wednesday , reflecting last year ’ s spending deal and tax cut . The gross national debt this week also hit a new milestone , at $ 22 trillion .

Congress in 2018 voted to suspend the limit through March 1 . After that , it takes effect again and the Treasury will begin using so-called extraordinary measures to manage its cash flow so it can make on-time payments to bondholders , Social Security beneficiaries , government employees and others .

federal_budget,The Guardian,0,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/09/trump-saddle-america-debt-bankrupted-hotels,Trump's America will be saddled with debt – just like his bankrupted hotels,2018-02-09,Richard Wolffe,"Once upon a time , conservatives said they hated Barack Obama because of his budget deficits . They said he was destroying America and its future , which made them very angry indeed . They were so mad about all those Obama debts that they invented a new party , and named it after the revolutionaries who opposed a nasty British king .
The Tea Party was a collection of strange people , including one candidate who promised she wasn ’ t a witch . But the strangest thing happened after Obama moved out of the White House , and an orange man moved in . That was when conservatives all across America decided they didn ’ t actually hate debt and deficits after all .
That was just one of the many ways Donald Trump made everyone happy in America all over again . Another one was the stock market , which sometimes goes up and sometimes goes down . Everyone was happy when it went up , and nobody talked about it when it went down .
Donald Trump knows a lot about debt because he has created so much of it himself . He ’ s like a grand wizard of debt because he has magically escaped from several dark boxes of it . He also knows a few grand wizard types and thinks they are some very fine people .
Grand Wizard Trump first learned his magic debt spells when he built a palace called the Taj Mahal in Atlantic City . He called it the eighth wonder of the world , and it certainly was wonderful how the business went bankrupt a year after it opened . Five other Trump palaces went bankrupt the next year , but he waved his wand and everything turned out fine . For him .
How did he escape from all that debt ? “ On occasion , ” he told Hillary Clinton on television , “ we used certain laws that are there. ” That certainly put her in her place .
Normal people find it hard to borrow money or run businesses after so many bankruptcies . But they don ’ t know the magic spells that Trump knows , and they don ’ t have a TV show that makes any buffoon look like a real businessman . They also don ’ t have Russian wizard friends who buy lots of their property at ridiculously high prices because that ’ s how they do something they call “ laundry ” .
Now we all know that cleanliness is next to godliness , which is why our sparklingly clean president could say such godly things at the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday .
“ As long as we are true to America ’ s founding and the example that all of these great founders have set , we can all be heroes to everybody and they can be heroes to us , ” said the man who heroically gave $ 130,000 to his friend Stormy Daniels so she could concentrate on her movie career .
Trump was very happy to be talking at the prayer breakfast . Not because of the praying or the breakfasting , but because his best friend from TV was going to be there . “ Will be heading over shortly to make remarks at The National Prayer Breakfast in Washington , ” he tweeted . “ Great religious and political leaders , and many friends , including TV producer Mark Burnett of our wonderful 14 season Apprentice triumph , will be there . Looking forward to seeing all ! ”
Even the prayer people were happy to set aside their morals . They know that Trump ’ s kind of magical thinking is precisely what the world needs right now , otherwise everybody would get very upset at the way the planet is warming , the threat of nuclear war , and the global refugee crisis . Right now we obviously need the kind of leader who is completely ignorant about the consequences , and just lives in the moment .
Because if we don ’ t live in the here and now , we might start thinking about all those Trump-sized debts that will land after a corporate tax cut that blew apart the federal budget and a spending deal that now promises to do the same .
Fortunately we live in a time when Republicans have learned from his leadership and abandoned all their old ways of thinking , which they used to call principles .
Mick Mulvaney counts the coins that are left in Trump ’ s budget office and he used to be worried about things like debt . But that was in the olden times , when he was trying to get confirmed for this current job , one year ago .
“ Our gross national debt has increased to almost $ 20tn . That number is so large as to defy description , ” he told senators . “ I believe , as a matter of principle , that the debt is a problem that must be addressed sooner , rather than later . ”

This was truly an undeveloped space in American politics , and it took a visionary like Trump to make it real . Let ’ s hope they all live happily ever after .","Once upon a time, conservatives said they hated Barack Obama because of his budget deficits. They said he was destroying America and its future, which made them very angry indeed. They were so mad about all those Obama debts that they invented a new party, and named it after the revolutionaries who opposed a nasty British king.

The Tea Party was a collection of strange people, including one candidate who promised she wasn’t a witch. But the strangest thing happened after Obama moved out of the White House, and an orange man moved in. That was when conservatives all across America decided they didn’t actually hate debt and deficits after all.

That was just one of the many ways Donald Trump made everyone happy in America all over again. Another one was the stock market, which sometimes goes up and sometimes goes down. Everyone was happy when it went up, and nobody talked about it when it went down.

Donald Trump knows a lot about debt because he has created so much of it himself. He’s like a grand wizard of debt because he has magically escaped from several dark boxes of it. He also knows a few grand wizard types and thinks they are some very fine people.



Grand Wizard Trump first learned his magic debt spells when he built a palace called the Taj Mahal in Atlantic City. He called it the eighth wonder of the world, and it certainly was wonderful how the business went bankrupt a year after it opened. Five other Trump palaces went bankrupt the next year, but he waved his wand and everything turned out fine. For him.

How did he escape from all that debt? “On occasion,” he told Hillary Clinton on television, “we used certain laws that are there.” That certainly put her in her place.

Normal people find it hard to borrow money or run businesses after so many bankruptcies. But they don’t know the magic spells that Trump knows, and they don’t have a TV show that makes any buffoon look like a real businessman. They also don’t have Russian wizard friends who buy lots of their property at ridiculously high prices because that’s how they do something they call “laundry”.



Now we all know that cleanliness is next to godliness, which is why our sparklingly clean president could say such godly things at the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday.



“As long as we are true to America’s founding and the example that all of these great founders have set, we can all be heroes to everybody and they can be heroes to us,” said the man who heroically gave $130,000 to his friend Stormy Daniels so she could concentrate on her movie career.

Trump was very happy to be talking at the prayer breakfast. Not because of the praying or the breakfasting, but because his best friend from TV was going to be there. “Will be heading over shortly to make remarks at The National Prayer Breakfast in Washington,” he tweeted. “Great religious and political leaders, and many friends, including TV producer Mark Burnett of our wonderful 14 season Apprentice triumph, will be there. Looking forward to seeing all!”

Even the prayer people were happy to set aside their morals. They know that Trump’s kind of magical thinking is precisely what the world needs right now, otherwise everybody would get very upset at the way the planet is warming, the threat of nuclear war, and the global refugee crisis. Right now we obviously need the kind of leader who is completely ignorant about the consequences, and just lives in the moment.

Because if we don’t live in the here and now, we might start thinking about all those Trump-sized debts that will land after a corporate tax cut that blew apart the federal budget and a spending deal that now promises to do the same.

Fortunately we live in a time when Republicans have learned from his leadership and abandoned all their old ways of thinking, which they used to call principles.



Mick Mulvaney counts the coins that are left in Trump’s budget office and he used to be worried about things like debt. But that was in the olden times, when he was trying to get confirmed for this current job, one year ago.

“Our gross national debt has increased to almost $20tn. That number is so large as to defy description,” he told senators. “I believe, as a matter of principle, that the debt is a problem that must be addressed sooner, rather than later.”



Mulvaney is so old-fashioned he called Obama’s budget in 2011 “a joke” for adding to the national debt about the same amount as Trump’s tax cuts. “It’s hard to explain how detached from reality this is, to think that the country can spend another $1.6tn when it doesn’t have the means,” he told Politico.



We all need to learn to love that old Trump magic. At the opening of his newest palace in Washington DC, just before his Russian friends helped him move into the White House, Trump used his wizarding powers of prediction to tell us what today would look like. (You knew it would look great, right?)



“Today is a metaphor for what we can accomplish for this country,” he said about a hotel that would become watering hole for foreign countries looking to line his pockets. “My job is to look at undeveloped spaces and imagine what they could be,” he explained. “These are spaces that have no hope, no future … We have so many things we can do for our country.”

And he was right. Nobody but Trump could have imagined that Republicans would vote for a trillion-dollar monster after so many years fighting a religious war against Obama for precisely the same thing. Nobody but Trump could have sold the idea of debt so well to the very people who said they hated it.

This was truly an undeveloped space in American politics, and it took a visionary like Trump to make it real. Let’s hope they all live happily ever after.

(CNSNews.com) - The debt of the federal government topped $24 trillion for the first time on Tuesday, when it climbed from $23,917,212,663,857.59 to $24,011,523,316,653.36, according to data released by the Treasury Department.

Some vindication

The inability of Boehner to control his majority in the House, many of whom take their cues from conservative advocates, has fostered perpetual gridlock on Capitol Hill and dwindling public support for Republicans and the overall Congress.

Thursday's budget vote may provided some vindication for Boehner as the House overwhelmingly approved a bipartisan compromise panned by conservative advocates, sending it to the Senate, where it is expected to pass next week.

But it proposes to reduce the deficit, relax forced military and other spending cuts under so-called sequestration, avoid another government shutdown, and restore a semblance of order to the congressional budget process, which has become an area of recurring political crisis in Washington.

A push on immigration coming?

Pelosi said she was ""encouraged"" by Boehner's pushback. But when pressed if she thought Republicans would turn over a new leaf and begin working across party lines on other issues, she didn't sound convinced that much would change.

""Certainly not achieving this would not have been a good signal, but I don't under or overestimate the power of this one event today,"" Pelosi said.

Not seeing eye-to-eye

A test of whether Boehner will continue to confront conservative criticism looms on another fiscal fight next year - the debate over increasing the nation's ability to borrow money to pay its bills -- or the debt limit.

That issue has rallied fiscal hard liners and outside groups to demand new spending reductions and entitlement reforms, Boehner will certainly face another round of pressure to not compromise with Democrats.

But this week has tested their unity.

( QUIZ: Do you know Ted Cruz?)

With Cruz as the ringleader, a handful of Senate conservatives are refusing to consent to budget negotiations with the House, instead engaging in open combat with more senior Republicans like McCain who are perplexed at their hardball tactics. The fight has given Cruz a new platform as he tries to claim the mantle of conservative provocateur, but it has left the Texas Republican increasingly alienated from many of his colleagues.

The unusual public sniping has put Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in an increasingly awkward spot as he must choose between the conservative firebrands with huge clout from the right who could very well run for president in 2016 and ending the internecine feud that is causing an unwelcome distraction for his party. It’s all reminiscent of the tea party versus establishment fights that have shaken Senate primaries in recent years — but this time, the battles are playing out on the Senate floor.

GOP leaders are sitting back, uncertain how the situation will resolve itself. Right now, it’s unclear who will win — but more Republicans appear to favor heading to conference than blocking it, though the voices in favor of the latter may be louder.

“I’m just watching,” said Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican and Cruz’s Texas colleague, even as Cornyn favors beginning conference talks.

Cruz isn’t alone in the fight, which he says is intended to prevent a debt limit increase from being added to the budget talks. He’s been leading the charge with fellow tea party Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky. It’s also a sign of how 2016 primary politics is shaping the Senate, with Rubio, Cruz and Paul all seen as likely rivals in a presidential bid.

Cruz even took the fight to his own party on Wednesday, when he said he doesn’t even “trust” Republicans to resolve the country’s fiscal problems or avoid including an increase to the debt ceiling.

“The senior senator from Arizona urged this body to trust the Republicans,” Cruz said on the floor Wednesday. “Let me be clear, I don’t trust the Republicans. I don’t trust the Democrats, and I think a whole lot of Americans likewise don’t trust the Republicans or the Democrats, because it is leadership in both parties that has got us into this mess.

On Thursday, he depicted the conference proceedings as a ruse to increase the ceiling by a simple majority instead of 60 votes.

The controversy started after Senate Democrats passed a budget in March — their first such plan in four years. Afterward, Democrats wanted to begin conference negotiations with House Republicans, who passed their own budget by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). A conference is part of the regular order that the GOP has long demanded.

But Senate conservatives objected to Majority Leader Harry Reid’s attempt to begin the proceedings, saying they wanted written assurances to take tax hikes and a debt limit increase off the table.",www.politico.com,left,WhDIxQhUQCncHlPZ

President Barack Obama signed the bill to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling early Thursday morning, the White House said in a statement, as the Office of Management and Budget alerted government workers to get ready to return to work on Thursday.

“Today, the president signed a continuing resolution that brings employees back to work and reopens many government functions.

The legislation should be judged on whether it aids efforts to slow the spread of coronavirus, aids the treatment of the infected, relieves the plight of those adversely affected by it and the fight against it, and supports the overall economy. These purposes, as we noted at the outset of this debate, sometimes overlap and sometimes conflict. They also call for placing speed ahead of efficiency, and both ahead of mere partisan objectives.

Congressional Democrats have not risen to this occasion. They saw an opportunity to advance goals on the environment, racial diversity, and Planned Parenthood funding that, whatever their other merits, do not belong in this bill. And they have been willing to slow down the process toward these ends.

The bill’s rebates — $1,200 for singles and $2,400 for married couples up to an income limit — are not especially well-designed.

To figure out why Republicans are winning the sequester wars, look at two numbers.

Federal employees have so far taken no furlough days. And the stock market hit an all-time record earlier this month, with the Dow closing Thursday at 14,578.

Amid all that, it’s pretty hard for most of the public to understand what the Democrats were talking about, with all their gloom-and-doom chatter earlier this year.

But so far, even the White House admits there’s little chance of reversing all the cuts.

There’s been no sudden shock to the system. In fact, the economy seems on the mend, with housing starts higher than before the Great Recession.

And if this drip-by-drip rollout continues, GOP activists say they'll keep the political high ground as the cuts slowly sink into the public consciousness — much in the same way people forget that before Sept. 11, they could make a dash for the airport gate without taking off their shoes.

“For most Americans, they’re not going to notice much of a difference,” said former House Republican leadership aide John Feehery.

In the government , budgets are statements of priorities rather than determining actual spending , but a statement of priorities is always a good way to assess a politician . And Trump ’ s priorities aren ’ t even a little bit surprising : defense spending and going after immigrants , yes ; the services American families rely on , no .
Trump ’ s budget will lay out “ an aggressive set of spending reforms ” to reduce the deficit by $ 3 trillion over a decade , according to a preview released by the White House on Sunday . “ Just like every American family , the Budget makes hard choices : fund what we must , cut where we can , and reduce what we borrow , ” White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney said in a statement .
Maybe if Republicans hadn ’ t already made the choice to give corporations and wealthy people a giant tax break , the budget choices would be a little less hard . Except the language of hard choices is dishonest here : people like Donald Trump and Mick Mulvaney revel in slashing programs that matter to middle- and working-class families .

Also in line for some Trump budget cash : border security and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement ’ s ability to detain and imprison immigrants .

But when you cut through the rhetoric against immigrants and in favor of hundreds of millions of dollars for unmanned tankers and against Medicaid and food stamps , remember this : all the talk of “ hard choices ” hinges on Republicans already having made the choice to give corporations and rich people a huge , deficit-exploding tax cut .","Donald Trump is releasing his second budget Monday, and … it’s a Donald Trump budget. In the government, budgets are statements of priorities rather than determining actual spending, but a statement of priorities is always a good way to assess a politician. And Trump’s priorities aren’t even a little bit surprising: defense spending and going after immigrants, yes; the services American families rely on, no.

Trump’s budget will lay out “an aggressive set of spending reforms” to reduce the deficit by $3 trillion over a decade, according to a preview released by the White House on Sunday. “Just like every American family, the Budget makes hard choices: fund what we must, cut where we can, and reduce what we borrow,” White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney said in a statement.

Maybe if Republicans hadn’t already made the choice to give corporations and wealthy people a giant tax break, the budget choices would be a little less hard. Except the language of hard choices is dishonest here: people like Donald Trump and Mick Mulvaney revel in slashing programs that matter to middle- and working-class families.

But there’s one thing that definitely won’t be cut:

Trump is seeking a massive boost to the Pentagon to allow for a “ready, larger, and more lethal military,” the White House said in the preview.

Gotta have that shiny hardware for Trump’s parades. Also in line for some Trump budget cash: border security and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement’s ability to detain and imprison immigrants. And while Trump is finally at least talking about spending some money on the opioid crisis, he’s looking at a law enforcement approach much more than treatment and recovery.

WASHINGTON – The national debt surpassed $22 trillion for the first time on Tuesday, a milestone that experts warned is further proof the country is on an unsustainable financial path that could jeopardize the economic security of every American.

The Treasury Department reported the debt hit $22.012 trillion, a jump of more than $30 billion in just this month.

The national debt has been rising at a faster rate following the passage of President Donald Trump’s $1.5 trillion tax-cut package a little more than a year ago and as the result of congressional efforts to increase spending on domestic and military programs. The nation has added more than $1 trillion in debt in the last 11 months alone.

“Reaching this unfortunate milestone so rapidly is the latest sign that our fiscal situation is not only unsustainable but accelerating,” said Michael A. Peterson, chief executive officer of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a nonpartisan organization working to address the country’s long-term fiscal challenges.

For Americans, the growing debt should be a concern, experts said, because over time it can push up interest rates for consumers and businesses. The higher rates can ripple through the economy, nudging up rates for mortgages, corporate bonds and other types of consumer and business loans.

A big national debt can also make it harder for the government to increase spending to combat the next recession or devote more money to retraining workers and helping the poor, among other programs.

Peterson attributed the growing national debt to ""a structural mismatch between spending and revenues."" The biggest drivers are the aging population, high healthcare costs, and growing interest payments, combined with a tax code that fails to generate sufficient revenue, he said.

The debt eclipsing $22 trillion “is another sad reminder of the inexcusable tab our nation’s leaders continue to run up and will leave for the next generation,” said Judd Gregg and Edward Rendell, co-chairmen of the nonpartisan Campaign to Fix the Debt, a project of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

With deficits rising and gross debt scheduled to jump by more than $1 trillion annually, Congress must take action to put the country on a more sustainable path, Gregg and Rendell said.

“The fiscal recklessness over the past years has been shocking, with few willing to step up with a real plan,” they said. “We need responsible leadership to fix the debt, not a worsening of partisanship.”

Setting the stage for a contentious debate over reducing the nation 's deficit , President Obama today drew a clear line in the sand about the extent to which he will compromise in order to get a congressional deal on deficit reduction , insisting that while he is `` open to new ideas '' and `` committed to solving our fiscal challenges , '' he will reject any approach that does not involve a tax increase on America 's highest-income families .
The president , speaking from the East Room of the White House to an audience made up partly of middle-class Americans , stressed his commitment to pursuing a bipartisan approach in tackling the so-called `` fiscal cliff , '' a combination of tax increases and spending cuts scheduled to go into effect January 2013 that , left untended , threatens to plunge the U.S. economy back into recession .
`` The American people voted for action , not politics as usual . You elected us to focus on your jobs , not ours , '' he said . `` In that spirit , '' Mr. Obama said , he has invited leaders from both parties , as well as business , labor and civic leaders from across the country , for a dialogue on staving off what many believe is an impending fiscal crisis .
The Bush-era tax cuts are set to expire at the end of the year , and January 1 , 2013 also marks the day when $ 1.2 trillion worth of budget cuts , which cut across domestic programs and the Pentagon , begin to go into effect unless Congress can reach a deal to offset them . On the same day , a payroll tax cut will expire , as will a deferment of payment cuts to Medicare physicians .
`` Our top priority has to be jobs and growth . That 's the focus of the plan that I talked about during the campaign , '' said Mr. Obama . But , in a direct challenge to House Republicans , he rejected the idea of extending the Bush-era tax cuts for Americans with incomes of over $ 250,000 per year .
`` I 'm open to compromise . I 'm open to new ideas . I 'm committed to solving our fiscal challenges , '' he said . `` But I refuse to accept any approach that is n't balanced . I am not going to ask students and seniors and middle-class families to pay down the entire deficit while people like me , who are making over $ 250,00 a year , are n't asked to pay a dime more in taxes . I 'm not going to do that . ''
Publicly , House Speaker John Boehner has signaled an openness to working with the president and Democrats in forging a deal to avert going over the fiscal cliff , stressing that Republicans want to `` rise above the dysfunction , and do the right thing together for our country in a bipartisan way . ''
But in his first press conference following Mr. Obama 's re-election , Boehner , too , drew a firm line on the issue of tax cuts .

Boehner reiterated his position shortly before Mr. Obama 's speech , noting that Republicans want to avert the fiscal cliff without raising any taxes and `` in a manner that ensures that 2013 is finally the year that our government comes to grips with the major problems that are facing us . '' Next year , he argued , `` should be the year we begin to solve our debt through tax reform and entitlement reform . ''
Mr. Obama appears ready to call that bluff , suggesting that his re-election serves as a mandate from the public to carry out his calls to permanently suspend some of the Bush tax cuts . Following the president 's remarks , his office reiterated that he would veto a bill to extend those cuts on incomes above $ 250,000 .
`` I just want to point out , this was a central question during the election . It was debated over and over again . And on Tuesday night we found out that the majority of Americans agree with my approach , '' said Mr. Obama . `` That includes Democrats , independents and a lot of Republicans across the country , as well as independent economists and budget experts . That 's how you reduce the deficit , with a balanced approach . ''
The president 's next task , as he acknowledged , is to get a Republican-led Congress to comply with his wishes .
`` Our job now is to get a majority in Congress to reflect the will of the American people . I believe we can get that majority . I was encouraged to hear Speaker Boehner agree that tax revenue has to be part of this equation . So I look forward to hearing his ideas when I see him next week , '' said Mr. Obama , declining to acknowledge that Boehner has already rejected his approach in two separate news conferences .
Democrats , however , seem to think that House Republicans will cave .

According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office , inaction on the fiscal cliff could have devastating consequences to the nation 's fragile growth : Its analysts warn that a prolonged deadlock could hike the unemployment rate back up to 9.1 percent by next fall , and that that preventing the defense cuts would alone save 40,000 jobs .

Cruz, however, was unapologetic.

""Today's vote is yet another example that establishment politicians from both parties are simply not listening to the American people,"" he said. ""Outside the beltway, Americans of all political stripes understand that we cannot keep spending money we don't have.""

With Congress on break next week for the President's Day holiday, failure to pass the debt ceiling measure Wednesday would have brought the nation close enough to the deadline to possibly shake financial markets.

GOP change in tactics

Until it happened, House Republicans insisted that any increase in the borrowing limit had to come attached to deficit-reduction provisions.

At a closed-door meeting on Monday, they discussed a plan to increase the debt ceiling until March 2015 -- past the upcoming congressional elections in November -- while also repealing cuts to military pensions that were part of the recently passed federal budget.

Less than 18 hours later, though, Boehner told reporters the GOP proposal couldn't pass because ""we don't have 218 votes.""

Some conservatives oppose raising the debt ceiling under any circumstance, while Democrats had made it clear they would unanimously reject any measure that tacked other provisions onto an increase in the borrowing limit.

Without a purely Republican majority, Boehner decided to split up the GOP plan by holding separate votes on repealing the military pension cuts and a clean debt ceiling increase.

The House easily passed the military pension measure earlier on Tuesday, then passed the clean debt ceiling legislation. Both Boehner and his top deputy -- House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia -- were among the 28 Republicans who supported the measure.

On Wednesday, the Senate also passed the military pension measure after the votes on the debt ceiling legislation.

Republicans facing pressure from conservatives ahead of the November vote were reluctant to back any kind of hike in the borrowing limit, a core issue for the political right because it represents rising federal debt.

Boehner blames Obama

Despite his support for the proposal, Boehner put the blame for needing a ""clean"" debt-ceiling bill with no deficit reduction provisions on Obama, saying the rising federal debt was his fault.

""It's the President driving up the debt and the President wanted to do nothing about the debt that's occurring, will not engage in our long-term spending problem,"" Boehner said. ""And so, let his party give him the debt ceiling increase that he wants.""

At the same time, Boehner declared himself disappointed about what he called a ""lost opportunity"" to address unsustainable federal spending.

The Government Accountability Office said in 2012 that the delays in raising the debt ceiling in 2011 cost the government $ 1.3 billion in higher interest payments that year… if political leaders want to prioritize fiscal responsibility , they shouldn ’ t need a legal mechanism to do so ; they should simply act accordingly. ” Kevin Carmichael , NBC News
Regarding the debt ceiling , “ rather than treating [ it ] as a matter of good housekeeping , politicians have fallen into the habit of flirting with default , engaging in bouts of brinkmanship that culminate in ad hoc deals on borrowing and spending . Congress seems unable to perform its duties unless it is acting under the threat of crisis… This is not a good way to run a government . ” Editorial Board , New York Times
“ Many progressives seem to want Democrats to learn from the scorched-earth tactics of Republicans . But Republicans would be wiser to learn from the bargaining strategy of Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer . Except for a brief shutdown in January 2018 over immigration that was quickly , and wisely , abandoned , congressional Democrats haven ’ t tried to take the government hostage during the Trump administration . ( The only protracted shutdown of the Trump presidency was instigated by Trump , effectively taking his own government hostage in order to win border wall money . It didn ’ t work . ) Instead , Democratic leaders have negotiated budget agreements with Republicans in good faith , and they have won policy victories in the process. ” Bill Scher , Politico
“ I don ’ t doubt that many House members elected in the Tea Party wave of 2010 truly thought they were helping the economy by trying to bring federal spending down… But Congressional Republicans ’ overall loss of interest in deficit reduction after Trump ’ s inauguration does seem to indicate that partisan calculations were paramount… House Democrats , meanwhile , have far less ideological reason to oppose increases in government spending . But their unwillingness since taking charge in January to play hardball on legislation that might endanger the ongoing expansion also seems to bespeak a different attitude toward partisanship and macroeconomic policy . House Republicans were willing to hold the U.S. economy hostage for partisan advantage . House Democrats have not been. ” Justin Fox , Bloomberg
Many argue , “ It 's official : Conservatives only care about deficits when a Democrat is president … Everyone in Washington seems to suddenly accept the economic and political benefits of government spending , as the GOP hopes to keep the stock market goosed past Trump 's reelection . While it 's great that Washington appears to have avoided another truly stupid , self-inflicted government shutdown , Congress is whistling past the graveyard . That 's because deficits are growing while the economy is booming — up 23 % in the first nine months of the fiscal year alone . That 's not supposed to happen . And there will be hell to pay when the remorseless math of rapidly falling tax revenue kicks in during the next downturn. ” John Avlon , CNN
“ Discretionary spending has been declining steadily for four decades , interrupted only by the Iraq War and the Great Recession . The new budget deal will keep it at about 6 percent of GDP , the same as it was in 2000 and far less than it was in 1980 . This is hardly a picture of a budget that ’ s skyrocketing out of control . If the hawks want to gripe about mandatory spending—primarily Medicare , Medicaid , Social Security , and other social welfare programs—that ’ s fine . Gripe away . But today ’ s budget deal has nothing to do with that . ” Kevin Drum , Mother Jones
This is “ a good deal for Democrats and a big retreat from the Trump administration , which called for $ 150 billion in spending cuts . The budget cuts in this deal would likely go into effect down the road , which means there ’ s a chance a future Congress will overturn them down the line . The deal still has to be passed by the House and Senate , and signed by Trump . But by striking such a deal , congressional leaders and the Trump administration are averting a disaster scenario. ” Tara Golshan and Ella Nilsen , Vox

The Government Accountability Office said in 2012 that the delays in raising the debt ceiling in 2011 cost the government $1.3 billion in higher interest payments that year… if political leaders want to prioritize fiscal responsibility, they shouldn’t need a legal mechanism to do so ; they should simply act accordingly.” Kevin Carmichael, NBC News

Regarding the debt ceiling, “rather than treating [it] as a matter of good housekeeping, politicians have fallen into the habit of flirting with default, engaging in bouts of brinkmanship that culminate in ad hoc deals on borrowing and spending. Congress seems unable to perform its duties unless it is acting under the threat of crisis… This is not a good way to run a government .” Editorial Board, New York Times

“Many progressives seem to want Democrats to learn from the scorched-earth tactics of Republicans. But Republicans would be wiser to learn from the bargaining strategy of Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer . Except for a brief shutdown in January 2018 over immigration that was quickly, and wisely, abandoned, congressional Democrats haven’t tried to take the government hostage during the Trump administration. (The only protracted shutdown of the Trump presidency was instigated by Trump, effectively taking his own government hostage in order to win border wall money. It didn’t work.) Instead, Democratic leaders have negotiated budget agreements with Republicans in good faith, and they have won policy victories in the process.” Bill Scher, Politico

“I don’t doubt that many House members elected in the Tea Party wave of 2010 truly thought they were helping the economy by trying to bring federal spending down… But Congressional Republicans’ overall loss of interest in deficit reduction after Trump’s inauguration does seem to indicate that partisan calculations were paramount… House Democrats, meanwhile, have far less ideological reason to oppose increases in government spending. But their unwillingness since taking charge in January to play hardball on legislation that might endanger the ongoing expansion also seems to bespeak a different attitude toward partisanship and macroeconomic policy . House Republicans were willing to hold the U.S. economy hostage for partisan advantage. House Democrats have not been.” Justin Fox, Bloomberg

Many argue, “It's official: Conservatives only care about deficits when a Democrat is president … Everyone in Washington seems to suddenly accept the economic and political benefits of government spending, as the GOP hopes to keep the stock market goosed past Trump's reelection. While it's great that Washington appears to have avoided another truly stupid, self-inflicted government shutdown, Congress is whistling past the graveyard. That's because deficits are growing while the economy is booming — up 23% in the first nine months of the fiscal year alone. That's not supposed to happen. And there will be hell to pay when the remorseless math of rapidly falling tax revenue kicks in during the next downturn.” John Avlon, CNN

“Discretionary spending has been declining steadily for four decades, interrupted only by the Iraq War and the Great Recession. The new budget deal will keep it at about 6 percent of GDP, the same as it was in 2000 and far less than it was in 1980. This is hardly a picture of a budget that’s skyrocketing out of control. If the hawks want to gripe about mandatory spending—primarily Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and other social welfare programs—that’s fine. Gripe away. But today’s budget deal has nothing to do with that .” Kevin Drum, Mother Jones

This is “a good deal for Democrats and a big retreat from the Trump administration , which called for $150 billion in spending cuts. The budget cuts in this deal would likely go into effect down the road, which means there’s a chance a future Congress will overturn them down the line. The deal still has to be passed by the House and Senate, and signed by Trump. But by striking such a deal, congressional leaders and the Trump administration are averting a disaster scenario.” Tara Golshan and Ella Nilsen, Vox

What's new is that now Democrats don't need their President

This Congress is going out just the way it began: in complete disarray.

Fourteen months after tea party conservatives ignored Republican leaders and forced a two-week government shutdown, another one came close to happening -- this time because liberals were blowing off President Barack Obama's pleas to support a government funding measure.

In the early morning hours Friday, Obama signed a two-day extension, and the Senate is expected to pick up the legislation and vote on it later Friday, though they have until midnight Saturday before the next deadline.

For weeks, legislative leaders insisted another shutdown wouldn't happen. And it didn't. But the House was just two hours away, and the Senate might not cast its final votes until this weekend.

Republicans don't fear their leadership. And Democrats don't need their President.

After November's elections, when the GOP won the Senate and expanded its majority in the House, party leaders claimed a mandate. Soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has pledged that with Republicans in control of both chambers come January, things will be different. More amendments will be allowed. ""Center-right"" legislation will advance.

But long-clear divisions on the right remain -- and were evident in the House when 16 Republicans, many angry that the party hadn't fought harder to block Obama's executive action on immigration, opposed the measure in a key procedural vote and nearly dealt their leaders a major blow.

Even if Republicans gain stability, Democrats are splintering.

Fresh off an election that purged the Democrats of many of their most centrist members, liberals -- now more influential within their own ranks -- have gone rogue, saying ""no"" to what the White House called a fair compromise, even though their bargaining position isn't going to get better.

In an extraordinary scene Thursday afternoon, two of the party's most influential members made high-profile breaks with Obama. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi called the government funding measure ""blackmail"" because of its inclusion of language rolling back a Wall Street reform that Democrats had fought hard to win in 2010.

Meanwhile, the party's liberal hero, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, declared on the Senate floor that it is ""time for all of us to stand up and fight.""

Obama and Vice President Joe Biden were calling House Democrats, urging them to support the measure. White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough rushed into a caucus meeting to make its case.

“ It will be a tough budget , ” Kudlow said during an appearance on “ Fox News Sunday. ” “ We ’ re going to do our own caps this year and I think it ’ s long overdue . ”
Kudlow added : “ Some of these recent budget deals have not been favorable towards spending . So , I think it ’ s exactly the right prescription . ”

He said the budget will contain a proposed 5 percent across-the-board reduction in domestic spending .

Top lawmakers are pushing for a reprise of three prior deals to use spending cuts or new revenues and prop up additional spending rather than defray deficits that are again approaching $ 1 trillion .

TRUMP ASKS CABINET TO CUT DEPARTMENT BUDGETS BY 5 PERCENT
Trump 's upcoming budget , however , wo n't address any of the main factors behind the growing , intractable deficits that have driven the U.S. debt above $ 22 trillion . Its most striking proposed cuts — to domestic agency operations — were rejected when Tea Party Republicans controlled the House , and they face equally grim prospects now that Democrats are in the majority .
Trump has given no indication he 's interested in the deficit , and he has rejected any idea of curbing Medicare or Social Security , the massive federal retirement programs whose imbalances are the chief deficit drivers .
Kudlow – a former Wall Street analyst and economic commentator – said that the 2020 proposal will also keep the 3 percent tax cuts implemented in 2018 .
“ If you want to deal with budget deficits , you ’ ve got rapid growth which means keep the tax cuts in place , ” He said . “ We believe the 3 percent tax rates of 2018 will continue in 2019 and beyond 2020 and so forth . ”
One area that won ’ t see a cut in the proposed budget is for funding for the president ’ s border wall .
The Washington Post reported on Sunday that Trump will request at least $ 8.6 billion in new funding to build additional sections of a wall along the Mexico border . Trump also wants $ 5 billion in additional funds for the Department of Homeland Security and another $ 3.6 billion in military construction funds .
All this would come in addition to the $ 6.5 billion Trump vowed last month to redirect for the construction of the wall .
“ I would just say that the whole issue of the wall and border security is a paramount of importance , ” Kudlow said on Sunday . “ We have a crisis down there . I think the president has made that case effectively . It ’ s a crisis of economics , it ’ s a crisis of crime and drugs , it ’ s a crisis of just of humanity . ”","White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow revealed Sunday that President Trump wants a 5 percent cut “across the board” on all domestic spending as part of his proposed 2020 budget.

Its most striking proposed cuts — to domestic agency operations — were rejected when Tea Party Republicans controlled the House, and they face equally grim prospects now that Democrats are in the majority.

Trump has given no indication he's interested in the deficit, and he has rejected any idea of curbing Medicare or Social Security, the massive federal retirement programs whose imbalances are the chief deficit drivers.

Kudlow – a former Wall Street analyst and economic commentator – said that the 2020 proposal will also keep the 3 percent tax cuts implemented in 2018.

“If you want to deal with budget deficits, you’ve got rapid growth which means keep the tax cuts in place,” He said. “We believe the 3 percent tax rates of 2018 will continue in 2019 and beyond 2020 and so forth.”

One area that won’t see a cut in the proposed budget is for funding for the president’s border wall.

The Washington Post reported on Sunday that Trump will request at least $8.6 billion in new funding to build additional sections of a wall along the Mexico border. Trump also wants $5 billion in additional funds for the Department of Homeland Security and another $3.6 billion in military construction funds.

All this would come in addition to the $6.5 billion Trump vowed last month to redirect for the construction of the wall.

“I would just say that the whole issue of the wall and border security is a paramount of importance,” Kudlow said on Sunday. “We have a crisis down there. I think the president has made that case effectively. It’s a crisis of economics, it’s a crisis of crime and drugs, it’s a crisis of just of humanity.”

Filner got shady cash from Mexican tycoon - Foreign Policy: “In a first of its kind case, federal prosecutors say a Mexican businessman funneled more than $500,000 into U.S. political races through Super PACs and various shell companies… Local newspaper UT San Diego traced the contributions and identified the candidates as former [Democratic] San Diego Mayor Bob Filner, [Republican] District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis, [Democratic] mayoral candidate Nathan Fletcher and a U.S. congressman believed to be Juan Vargas (D-CA).”

KASICH TO ADDRESS CONSERVATIVE JEWS

Washington Examiner: “In a move certain to stoke further speculation that he is seriously weighing a bid for the presidency, Ohio Gov. John Kasich will speak at a Republican Jewish Coalition leadership meeting in March, the group announced in an email to members Monday. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Ambassador John Bolton, two other potential Republican presidential contenders, are also slated to speak during the three-day meeting in Las Vegas.”

BAIER TRACKS: HELL HATH NO FURY LIKE A CLINTON SCORNED

“When it rains, it pours, at least that seems to be the case for not-so-flattering, behind-the-scenes moments for the Clintons. Now, a new memoir by Congressman Jim Clyburn, D-S.C. details how former President Bill Clinton reacted to his wife's South Carolina primary loss to Barack Obama in 2008. Clyburn recounts receiving an explosive 2 a.m. phone call from the former president. US News has the eye-opening excerpt. Bottom line: One has to wonder how many more interesting, still unrevealed stories of Clinton power moves are yet to come – even before there is officially a candidate Hillary Clinton.” – Bret Baier

Bubba pitches for Ross - Former President Bill Clinton is lending a hand today to Arkansas Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Mike Ross. In an email to Ross supporters, Politico reports, Clinton writes: “When I was running for governor of Arkansas in 1982, a talented and energetic young man named Mike Ross was a big help to me and my campaign. Mike drove me all over the state and I became close friends with him. I even had a hunch that someday he might run for governor himself…” Clinton adds: “Take it from someone who knows a thing or two about being governor of Arkansas: Mike Ross will be a great one.” This is the Big He’s first foray into a gubernatorial contest since stumping for longtime fundraiser Terry McAuliffe’s successful campaign in Virginia last year. The race to replace term-limited Gov. Mike Beebe, D-Ark., is shaping up as a narrow contest between Ross, a former House member, and Republican frontrunner Asa Hutchison, a former congressman and head of the DEA.

CRIST FUNDRAISING STILL SHRIVELING

Sunshine State News: “Gov. Rick Scott [R-Fla.] brought in a campaign haul four times larger than former Gov. Charlie Crist [now a Democrat] did in the month of January, according to campaign finance reports. Scott’s ‘Let’s Get to Work’ political committee raked in $3.4 million for the month of January. When coupled with $743,000 in contributions to his campaign account, the governor brought in $4.1 million in the first month of 2014. Charlie Crist… brought in $637,000 through his ‘Charlie Crist for Florida’ political committee and $375,000 from his own campaign, totaling $1,012,000 -- only a quarter of what Scott raised. So far, Gov. Scott severely outpaces Crist in the fundraising game – he’s raised $32,263,000 so far while Crist, who announced he’d be running for governor in November, has raised a total of $5,048,000.”

PENNSYLVANIA DEM GOV FRONTRUNNER BACKS LEGAL POT

“During a lengthy discussion with Philadelphia Weekly on Monday, U.S. Rep. Allyson Schwartz [D-Pa.] revealed that not only is she in favor of medical marijuana at the state level, but she’d be open to decriminalizing simple possession of the plant, as well, if she were governor.”

PICK SIX: TINSEL IN THE BLUEGRASS

The GOP needs to pick up six seats to wrest control of the Senate from Democrats. Which six seats currently held by the blue team could go red? Based on Fox News First reader emails and tweets the consensus is: Arkansas, Montana, Louisiana, South Dakota, North Carolina and Alaska. But reader Scott Donaldson of Keller, Texas reminds us that Democrats would be hugely helped by potential GOP losses in either of the two races – Georgia and Kentucky – where nasty Republican primary fights give Democrats a chance to offset expected losses elsewhere. “I think the general consensus is pretty much right on,” but notes that “with all the Hollywood money pouring into Kentucky, I think [Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell] could lose.”

MADISON PAC BACKS ‘INVIOLABLE’ BROUN FOR GEORGIA SENATE

The Madison Project, a conservative group led by former Rep. Jim Ryun’s, R-Kans., announced its support Rep. Paul Broun, R-Ga. “It is not an exaggeration to say that Congressman Paul Broun (R-GA) has sustained the most conservative voting record over the longest period of time of any sitting Republican in Congress,” states the Madison Project press release announcing the endorsement. “Even the fiercest conservative fighters tend to succumb to the establishment meat grinder after a few years. Paul Broun has been inviolable.” Broun faces colleagues Reps. Phil Gingrey, R-Ga., and Jack Kingston R-Ga., former secretary of state Karen Handel, and businessman David Perdue in a May 20 primary.

GRAHAM SPENDS BIG TO TOUT CONSERVATIVE CRED

With four months left until South Carolina’s GOP Senate primary, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., is spending big to burnish his conservative credentials. The Palmetto State senator just launched a six-figure radio and television ad campaign. The ad praises Graham for opposing ObamaCare “from day one,” leading the “fight on Benghazi,” and for being “a conservative leader who gets things done.” Five Republicans are in the running to replace the two-term incumbent.

GILLESPIE CLOSES IN ON WARNER

A new poll conducted by the Republican Firm Harper Polling for the conservative American Action Forum finds Republican Ed Gillespie narrowing Sen. Mark Warner’s, D-Va., lead. According to the survey, Warner now leads the former Republican National Committee chairman 44 percent to 38 percent. Earlier polling showed Warner leading Gillespie by over 20 points. Politico reports.

MOURNING THEIR HOUSE CHANCES

“President Barack Obama will host a fundraiser for House Democrats at the home of former NBA star Alonzo Mourning. That's according to an invitation to the event obtained by The Associated Press. The event in Miami on March 20 will benefit the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and other lawmakers will also attend.”



THAT’S NOR-WAY TO WIN CONFIRMATION

President Obama’s nominee to be U.S. ambassador to Norway, George Tsunis, is a big-time political patron of the president’s but not much of an expert on the Scandinavian nation. T. Michael Davis of the Norwegian-American Chamber of Commerce is pleading for the Senate to reject Tsunis, who operates a 10-motel chain in the Northeastern U.S. On Davis’ list of complaints: “Well, he acknowledged he has never even been to Norway… He repeatedly referred to its prime minister as a ‘president,’ apparently unaware Norway is a parliamentary democracy. He attacked Norway’s governing center-right coalition by disparaging the nation’s third-largest political party – a key player that holds no less than seven minister posts – mistakenly characterizing it as a group of ‘fringe elements’ that ‘spew their hatred.’… Norwegians of all political stripes were deeply insulted, causing one member of Parliament to demand an apology from President Obama. …The headline of a Norwegian daily smoldered: ‘Future US envoy displays total ignorance of Norway,’ characterizing Tsunis as ‘faltering’ and ‘incoherent’ and committing ‘a jaw-dropping diplomatic blunder before he even begins.’” Of course, this shouldn’t be much of a surprise. Noah Bryson Mamet, also an Obama political contributor, admitted he’d never been to Argentina, the country he’s been nominated to serve as U.S. ambassador.



[New at Fox News Opinion - John Stossel considers Privileged People: “For the first time in history, six of the richest counties in the U.S. surround D.C. When a small group of people gets to dispense $3.6 trillion and set rules that can help or kill your idea, you want to suck up to them.”]

Better than tote bags and coffee mugs - Slate offers a cool map to show what President Obama’s top donors have given to be rewarded with diplomatic postings. It takes more than $1 million to get a prime spot like Britain or Thailand that brings the connections and prestige to get even richer, but you can slide into the sunny Dominican Republic for a cool half-million dollars.



RUN FOR IT!

This can’t be good. Florida and Louisiana readers please take note: University of Tennessee Study Finds Crocodiles Climb Trees “[Researchers] observed crocodile species on three continents – Australia, Africa and North America... Some species were observed climbing as far as [13 feet] high in a tree and [16 feet] down a branch.” And they can trick us too! “Research… found another surprising crocodile characteristic – the use of lures such as sticks to hunt prey.” What’s next? Driving cars? Firearms?



AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…

“You talk about the bailout of insurers: There’s an overwhelming majority of Americans who will say ‘no’ … and I would have liked to see the Democrats defend the bailout and risk the debt ceiling. But, there weren’t enough Republicans in the House who would do that, and thus, [House Speaker John Boehner] had no cards, and thus, he had to fold. It was the right thing to do, given his circumstances.” – Charles Krauthammer on “Special Report with Bret Baier.”

Republican Rep. John Fleming, R-Louisiana, said Thursday the short-term extension idea came out of an ad hoc group led by House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan, and Boehner signaled he supported the approach.

At one of the closed door sessions at the retreat, rank and file members viewed a slide show that highlighted how one of the last major deficit reduction packages – known as Gramm-Rudman – was preceded by a series of short term extensions in the debt ceiling.

Fleming said many conservatives backed the idea.

""I think we're all pretty much on board,"" Fleming said, and noted that impetus behind it was to keep the pressure on for reaching a broader deal to cut spending.

Legislators call for restoring plan's cuts to future military pension benefits

President Barack Obama is expected to sign the compromise

The House overwhelmingly passed the spending plan last week

For the first time in what seems like ages, Congress has passed a government spending plan without resorting to last-minute brinkmanship such as midnight negotiations to prevent an imminent government shutdown.

The Senate voted 64-36 on Wednesday to send the compromise federal budget framework to President Barack Obama, who has signaled his support.

Last week, the budget plan easily passed the House on a 332-94 vote, with solid majorities of both parties supporting it.

While Wednesday's Senate vote was closer, nine Republicans joined the majority Democrats to provide the required majority of at least 51 votes to pass.

The plan guides government spending into 2015, defusing the chances of a shutdown like the one in October that generated public anger against Congress, particularly conservative Republicans blamed for the impasse.

Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the budget committee leaders in both chambers, negotiated the deal that eliminates some forced spending cuts known as sequestration that both sides disliked while reducing the deficit by more than $20 billion in coming years.

Mixed opinions

An ABC News/Washington Post poll released Tuesday showed that 50% of respondents supported the budget plan while 35% opposed it. According to the survey, a majority of Democrats and independents backed the proposal, while only 39% of Republicans liked it.

Some Senate Republicans have said the most important issue at the moment was to lower the budget deficit, even if only by a small percentage, and avoid another damaging scenario like the 16-day government shutdown in October.

Budget compromise

Final congressional approval was a rare example of budget bipartisanship after two years of seemingly endless confrontation and acrimony reflecting the differing ideologies of the two sides.

Republicans, especially the conservative tea party wing that emerged in 2010, want to drastically shrink the government as the main tool for reducing federal deficits and debt. Democrats insist on protecting the social safety net for the most vulnerable Americans, such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.

With midterm elections next year, the Washington dysfunction has spawned public disgust reflected by polls showing support for Congress around record low levels.

Obama called the deal ""a good first step away from the shortsighted, crisis-driven decision-making that has only served to act as a drag on our economy.""

The plan

The budget agreement, which was months in the making, eases spending caps while softening the impact of the sequestration cuts on defense and non-defense programs.

It sets overall spending figures through fiscal year 2014, which started on October 1, as well as fiscal year 2015, with the intent of putting off any further congressional budget stalemate until after the November election.

The strong vote in the sharply divided House last week brought a collective sigh of relief among supporters, who initially thought it would sail through the Senate, where bipartisanship has been more the norm.

However, some Senate Republicans -- including several in leadership positions -- came out against the bill.

""I'd really like to stay within the (spending) caps,"" complained GOP Sen. John Boozman of Arkansas. ""This busts the caps, and as a result, I'll vote against it.""

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and others complained that the plan reduces some military pension benefits. He called for Obama to hold the bill until a bipartisan fix can be found.

""These heroes lay their lives on the line for us and they deserve us to fix this provision,"" Isakson said before voting for the budget agreement.

Three leading tea party-backed senators with 2016 presidential aspirations -- Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas, and Marco Rubio of Florida -- also have come out against the budget compromise for similar reasons.

Democrats wary, too

While Democrats support the bill, many had concerns.

More liberal senators -- like Tom Harkin of Iowa -- complained that an unemployment benefit extension was not included in the deal.

In a letter to the Speaker of the House and president of the Senate , Trump said he was nixing the 2.1 percent raise for most civilian federal workers and locality pay increases .
“ We must maintain efforts to put our Nation on a fiscally sustainable course , and Federal agency budgets can not sustain such increases , ” he wrote .
Trump said any increases in pay ought to be “ performance-based . ”
`` In light of our Nation 's fiscal situation , Federal employee pay must be performance-based , and aligned strategically toward recruiting , retaining , and rewarding high-performing Federal employees and those with critical skill sets , '' he wrote .
The proposal sets up a fight with Congress , which could effectively overturn the action in upcoming spending legislation . Without such intervention , the move would affect most of the 2.1 million federal employees around the nation , about 1.7 million of which live in areas outside of the Washington , D.C. , metro area . Members of the military , on the other hand , are on schedule to receive a 2.6 percent pay increase . Last year , the Trump administration approved a 1.4 percent increase in federal pay and a 2.4 percent increase in military pay . ( The Hill )
Trump faced criticism from both Democrats and Republicans for nixing the pay increase , with one Democrat even saying he “ just screwed ” federal employees .
`` To the hard-working federal employees Trump just screwed by cutting pay — the folks who run our parks , protect our communities , & serve our veterans : YOU MATTER , ” Rep. Eric Swalwell ( D-Calif. ) said on Twitter . “ If billionaires can get tax cuts , you should get a [ cost of living adjustment ] . You work hard for America & that should add up to something , '' he wrote .
“ For someone who claims to be a leadership maven , President Trump certainly gives the impression through his actions that he has no idea how to run an effective organization , '' said Rep. Steny Hoyer ( D-Md . ) , the No . 2 Democrat in the House .
`` Cutting federal pay is not the way to run the best government possible or to recruit and retain the most talented Americans to serve their fellow countrymen , '' he added .
`` His tax bill exploded the deficit , and now he is trying to balance the budget on the backs of federal workers , '' said Rep. Gerry Connolly , ( D-Va. ) .
Rep. Barbara Comstock ( R-Va. ) also expressed her opposition to the move , saying Republicans ought to support all federal employees .
`` Dedicated work is also done by our civilian employees at other national security agencies , the FBI , DEA and other law enforcement agencies , as well as the National Institute of Health where dedicated federal employees search for cures to diseases that drive up the costs of health care everyday , '' she said .
“ We can not balance the budget on the backs of our federal employees and I will work with my House and Senate colleagues to keep the pay increase in our appropriations measures that we vote on in September , ” she added .","President Trump on Thursday canceled a scheduled pay raise for federal employees due to budget constraints.

A new study suggests otherwise .
The study by the Cato Institute 's Vanessa Brown Calder is called `` Parental Leave : Is There a Case for Government Action ? '' Before diving into the report findings , I want to question the timing of the conservative interest in government-provided paid leave . The economy is doing well and growing fast ; unemployment rates , no matter how you measure them , are pretty low ; and companies that have to compete for the better employees are expanding benefits , including paid leave . In other words , it 's an odd moment for conservatives to shift their position on government-provided paid leave , no matter how light the intervention .
The first issue Brown Calder tackles is the question of what the private provision of paid leave looks like . It 's meant to answer a recurring talking point from those who advocate for a federal paid leave policy that states that the United States is the only developed nation without a national paid family leave policy , though a few states have created their own programs . Because some of these supporters understand that the lack of federal provision does n't mean that the private sector is n't providing the benefit , they add that the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that only 15 percent of women benefit from paid leave .
Brown Calder then unpacks these notions . First she looks at the BLS number and finds that it does n't come close to including all paid leave options and benefits provided by private employers . Using more comprehensive government metrics , she shows that without the government mandating or paying for a paid parental leave benefit , between 45 percent and 63 percent of women report already having access to paid leave . The best part of this story is actually that the data show how the private sector has steadily increased its provision of paid leave to first-time mothers from 16 percent since the 1960s to over 50 percent in 2008 ( the last time data were available ) . If you add disability ( which is often used as paid leave ) , that number grows to 61 percent , which is a 280 percent increase over the period .
As a result , the share of first-time mothers who quit working declined `` from over 60 percent in 1961 to just over 20 percent in 2008 . '' As Brown Calder writes , `` This represents a 66 percent decline in first-time mothers who quit their jobs , in the absence of federal government supported leave . ''
Even in the absence of updated data , we can assume this upper trend is continuing . She writes , `` Over 100 large name-brand companies have created or expanded paid family leave policies over the last three years , and a long list of major companies , including Walmart , Walgreens , Home Depot , Target , Starbucks , Amazon , FedEx , and McDonald 's , have created or expanded paid leave programs since late 2017 alone . ''
Better news yet is that this expansion benefited low-wage and hourly workers , too . This is important since the data is clear that the women or men who do n't benefit from paid leave are historically lower-income women and hourly wage workers . Many of these workers do n't even qualify for the current 12 weeks of unpaid , job-protected leave through the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 .
Unfortunately , as her report shows too well , as much as we would love for everyone to get paid leave , a government-provided solution to the issue wo n't result in the proverbial free lunch that supporters hope for . It 's likely to have minimal effect , as the new benefit will be offset over time by lower wages . It could also give an incentive to employers to discriminate against childbearing-age workers for the benefits of older workers .
The study offers more evidence that government-provided paid leave results in fewer women in leadership roles , higher unemployment , and lesser pay for women . Brown Calder concludes suggesting that policymakers `` think broadly about improving workers ' lives and focus on removing barriers to workers ' career choices and improving economic efficiency . '' This can be done , for example , by eliminating licensing requirements and other regulations that increase the cost of child care—or implementing the 2017 Working Families Flexibility Act , allowing employees to bank overtime compensation and use it as future time off .

Phillip,"Congressional Republicans are `` demanding ransom '' by refusing to fund the government unless Democrats agree to alter the health care law that passed in 2010 , President Obama said today in a Rose Garden address .
`` They 're shutting down the government over an ideological crusade to deny affordable health care to many Americans , '' Obama said , flanked by Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and beneficiaries of the health care law 's new provisions .
`` They are demanding ransom just for doing their job , '' he added . `` This Republican shutdown did not have to happen . ''
The statement comes after Obama met in the Oval Office with 12 individuals who have either benefited from the Affordable Care Act 's changes to health insurance coverage or plan to enroll in coverage through the new insurance marketplaces that came online today .
Obama lambasted Republicans for making the dismantling of the health care law the `` centerpiece of their agenda , '' and he urged them to pass a budget and end the government shutdown .
`` I will not give in to reckless demands by some in the Republican Party to deny affordable health insurance to millions , '' Obama said . `` I will not negotiate over Congress ' ability to pay bills it 's already racked up .
With the next , potentially disastrous deadline right around the corner , the president urged lawmakers to raise the debt ceiling , warning `` it 'd be far more dangerous than a government shutdown , as bad as a shutdown is ; it would be an economic shutdown . ''
On the first day of the health insurance marketplaces ' opening to accept new enrollment , Obama acknowledged that the online system was experiencing `` glitches '' that he attributed to unexpected high demand .
`` More than 1 million people visited healthcare.gov before 7 in the morning , '' Obama said . `` We 're going to be speeding things up in the next few hours to handle this demand exceeding anything we expected . ''
Comparing the initial problems to issues with Apple 's rollout of a new operating system , Obama added , `` I do n't remember anybody suggesting Apple should stop selling iPhones or iPads . ''
But on Capitol Hill , both Houses of Congress reinforced their original positions today despite a government shutdown that left nearly 800,000 federal employees out of work without pay this morning , and more than a million other `` essential '' employees on the job with many of their paychecks delayed .
With national parks and war memorials closed , House Republicans are now looking for ways to blunt the shutdown 's damage , one politically sensitive part of the government at a time .
They plan to approve smaller spending bills that would fully fund veterans programs , the National Park Service and the District of Columbia .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid rejected the strategy on the Senate floor this afternoon .
`` Just another wacky idea from the Tea Party driven Republicans , '' Reid said . `` We ca n't and we wo n't be forced to chose between the parks and cancer research . ''
But Republicans say Democrats are the ones who refuse to negotiate over funding the government as previous presidents and Congresses have in the past .
`` Democratic leaders in Congress finally have their prize , a government shutdown that no one seems to want but them , '' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said .
Republicans held late-night votes in the House of Representatives in the early hours this morning to reaffirm their demands that the Democratic Senate agree to undermine President Obama 's health care law in exchange for funding the government and that the Senate appoint representatives to a conference committee on the budget .
Democrats , in turn , gaveled the Senate into session this morning only to reject the House 's bill , and Democratic leaders say they will only pass a bill to fund the government with no strings attached .
Meanwhile , with the stroke of midnight , the Affordable Care Act 's health exchanges opened for business , allowing the uninsured to purchase health insurance .
And despite the Republican strategy to put the brakes on the health care bill , the law was implemented , starting today , regardless of the government shutdown .
The impact of the shutdown , however , is being felt in other ways . National parks in Washington and across the country are closed to the public and much of the government will be operating at reduced staffing levels that will lead to widespread delay .
People seeking Federal Housing Administration home loans will have to wait until the shutdown ends to secure mortgages . And in Washington , the courts have stopped issuing marriage licenses and performing weddings .
The political consequences could be grave for both parties in Congress , but especially for Republicans . According to an ███-Washington Post poll released Monday , 63 percent say they disapprove of Republicans ' handling of the budget debate compared to 50 percent who disapprove of Obama 's handling of the situation .
`` The question is how fast does public pressure grow , particularly on Republicans , '' said Sarah Binder , expert in Congress and legislative politics and a professor at George Washington University . `` There are federal employees everywhere . ''
`` We underestimate some of the networks within which lawmakers will find themselves back home . ''","Congressional Republicans are ""demanding ransom"" by refusing to fund the government unless Democrats agree to alter the health care law that passed in 2010, President Obama said today in a Rose Garden address.

""They are demanding ransom just for doing their job,"" he added. ""This Republican shutdown did not have to happen.""

The statement comes after Obama met in the Oval Office with 12 individuals who have either benefited from the Affordable Care Act's changes to health insurance coverage or plan to enroll in coverage through the new insurance marketplaces that came online today.

Obama lambasted Republicans for making the dismantling of the health care law the ""centerpiece of their agenda,"" and he urged them to pass a budget and end the government shutdown.

""I will not give in to reckless demands by some in the Republican Party to deny affordable health insurance to millions,"" Obama said. ""I will not negotiate over Congress' ability to pay bills it's already racked up.

""Pass a budget. End this shutdown.""

With the next, potentially disastrous deadline right around the corner, the president urged lawmakers to raise the debt ceiling, warning ""it'd be far more dangerous than a government shutdown, as bad as a shutdown is; it would be an economic shutdown.""

On the first day of the health insurance marketplaces' opening to accept new enrollment, Obama acknowledged that the online system was experiencing ""glitches"" that he attributed to unexpected high demand.

""More than 1 million people visited healthcare.gov before 7 in the morning,"" Obama said. ""We're going to be speeding things up in the next few hours to handle this demand exceeding anything we expected.""

Comparing the initial problems to issues with Apple's rollout of a new operating system, Obama added, ""I don't remember anybody suggesting Apple should stop selling iPhones or iPads.""

The Most Surprising Consequences of a Government Shutdown

But on Capitol Hill, both Houses of Congress reinforced their original positions today despite a government shutdown that left nearly 800,000 federal employees out of work without pay this morning, and more than a million other ""essential"" employees on the job with many of their paychecks delayed.

With national parks and war memorials closed, House Republicans are now looking for ways to blunt the shutdown's damage, one politically sensitive part of the government at a time.

They plan to approve smaller spending bills that would fully fund veterans programs, the National Park Service and the District of Columbia.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid rejected the strategy on the Senate floor this afternoon.

""Just another wacky idea from the Tea Party driven Republicans,"" Reid said. ""We can't and we won't be forced to chose between the parks and cancer research.""

But Republicans say Democrats are the ones who refuse to negotiate over funding the government as previous presidents and Congresses have in the past.

""Democratic leaders in Congress finally have their prize, a government shutdown that no one seems to want but them,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said.

LIVE Updates: Government Shutdown Day 1

Republicans held late-night votes in the House of Representatives in the early hours this morning to reaffirm their demands that the Democratic Senate agree to undermine President Obama's health care law in exchange for funding the government and that the Senate appoint representatives to a conference committee on the budget.

Democrats, in turn, gaveled the Senate into session this morning only to reject the House's bill, and Democratic leaders say they will only pass a bill to fund the government with no strings attached.

Meanwhile, with the stroke of midnight, the Affordable Care Act's health exchanges opened for business, allowing the uninsured to purchase health insurance.

And despite the Republican strategy to put the brakes on the health care bill, the law was implemented, starting today, regardless of the government shutdown.

Government Shutdown Standoff: What Happens Next?

The impact of the shutdown, however, is being felt in other ways. National parks in Washington and across the country are closed to the public and much of the government will be operating at reduced staffing levels that will lead to widespread delay.

People seeking Federal Housing Administration home loans will have to wait until the shutdown ends to secure mortgages. And in Washington, the courts have stopped issuing marriage licenses and performing weddings.

Government Shutdown by the Numbers

The political consequences could be grave for both parties in Congress, but especially for Republicans. According to an ABC News-Washington Post poll released Monday, 63 percent say they disapprove of Republicans' handling of the budget debate compared to 50 percent who disapprove of Obama's handling of the situation.

""The question is how fast does public pressure grow, particularly on Republicans,"" said Sarah Binder, expert in Congress and legislative politics and a professor at George Washington University. ""There are federal employees everywhere.""

""We underestimate some of the networks within which lawmakers will find themselves back home.""

That’s because Obama’s all-in on an outside strategy, doing just about everything other than holding serious talks with Republicans. In the last two days alone, he’s courted local TV anchors, called in a select group of White House correspondents to talk off the record, chatted up black broadcasters and announced plans to stump next week at Virginia’s Newport News Shipyard. Throughout, he’s talked in tough terms that signal little interest in compromise — or suggestion of backing down.

He’s navigating a thin line. Obama is convinced he’s got the upper hand on Republicans. Yet he can go only so long before he risks being perceived as a main actor in Washington’s dysfunction, threatening a core element of his political brand — and the fragile economic recovery he’s struggled to maintain.

The calls placed Thursday to Boehner and McConnell were prompted, in part, by a White House desire to inoculate Obama from that exact criticism.

So far, the White House has reason to feel good about where it stands. New polling shows Obama’s popularity sits at a three-year high. Americans would blame Republicans if a deal to avert the sequester isn’t reached. And even a majority of Republican voters back Obama’s call for both spending cuts and tax hikes.

But Obama’s been virtually absent from the legislative process — more so than during previous budget showdowns. And if the president wants his public offensive to work, he needs to keep attention focused on Republicans and why they refuse to consider new revenue as part of a deal to avert the $1.2 trillion sequester.

“I will be honest with you right now,” Obama told SiriusXM host Joe Madison Thursday, “it is not clear to me that the Republicans are going to agree to turn this sequester off despite the fact that 75 percent of the American people agree with me in terms of the approach and disagree with them.”

“ The issue here is whether Washington will pay its bills , ” Obama said in the final press conference of his first term . “ We are not a deadbeat nation . ”
The president ’ s comments opened the roughly 30-minute White House question-and-answer session with reporters that focused largely on the debt ceiling and Obama ’ s gun-control plans in the aftermath of last month ’ s mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown , Conn. , in which 26 were killed .
Obama , who vowed following the Dec. 14 massacre to curb gun violence , repeated his promise .
“ If there is a step we can take that will save even one child from what happened in Newtown , we should take that step , ” said the president , who is expected to get strong opposition from gun rights groups should he submit legislation to Congress , as expected .
Obama also suggested such groups are publicizing what appears to be strong turnouts at gun shows as “ an effective way of ginning up fear on the part of gun owners that somehow the federal government is about to take all of your guns . ”
Andrew Arulanandam , a National Rifle Association spokesman said , “ The president should go talk to the people buying firearms and ask them why they 're buying firearms . ''
Obama also said some of his proposed changes will require legislation and some of them can be accomplished through executive action .
The president used the press conference to attempt to frame the debt limit issue to the American public as one about the perils of not paying past debts – not about future spending .
“ Raising the debt ceiling does not authorize more spending , ” he said . “ These are bills that have already been racked up . ”
Republicans leaders responded by saying the debit limit debate is connected to spending , suggesting another round of intense negotiations when Congress returns later this month .
`` The American people do not support raising the debt ceiling without reducing government spending at the same time , ” said House Speaker John Boehner . “ The House will do its job and pass responsible legislation that controls spending , meets our nation 's obligations and keeps the government running , and we will insist that the Democratic majority in Washington do the same . ''
Boehner 's remarks were in sharp contrast to those of Obama , who said near the start of the press conference that he won re-election on his plan , which separates the debt ceiling from talks about reducing the U.S. deficit through spending cuts and increasing tax revenue through closing loopholes .
Obama argued he has already reduced federal spending by $ 1.2 trillion over the past two years but remains willing to talk about more cuts , including some to Medicare .
Still , the president acknowledged the Republican-controlled House likely has enough votes to demand spending cuts be part of the debate , which would result in no increase to the debt limit and the county defaulting on its bills .
The chamber returns to negotiate with the Democrat-controlled Senate and the White House on three fiscal matters with looming deadlines : the debt ceiling , massive federal spending cuts known as sequester and a budget resolution .
The talks resume because Washington again failed after the November elections to reach a long-term solution to the country ’ s debt and deficit issues .
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said Obama and his allies need to get serious about spending and that the debt limit debate is “ the perfect time for it . ”
The Kentucky senator also called the county ’ s debt and deficit a “ huge , huge problem . ''
On a question about Obama nominating only men to his Cabinet for his second term , the president told critics to wait until his selections are complete “ before they rush to justice . ”","President Obama on Monday warned congressional Republicans again that he will not negotiate over the debt ceiling, saying Washington must increase the limit to pay its bills and that such brinksmanship would be “absurd” and “irresponsible.”

The president used the press conference to attempt to frame the debt limit issue to the American public as one about the perils of not paying past debts – not about future spending.

“Raising the debt ceiling does not authorize more spending,” he said. “These are bills that have already been racked up.”

Republicans leaders responded by saying the debit limit debate is connected to spending, suggesting another round of intense negotiations when Congress returns later this month.

""The American people do not support raising the debt ceiling without reducing government spending at the same time,” said House Speaker John Boehner. “The House will do its job and pass responsible legislation that controls spending, meets our nation's obligations and keeps the government running, and we will insist that the Democratic majority in Washington do the same.""

Boehner's remarks were in sharp contrast to those of Obama, who said near the start of the press conference that he won re-election on his plan, which separates the debt ceiling from talks about reducing the U.S. deficit through spending cuts and increasing tax revenue through closing loopholes.

Obama argued he has already reduced federal spending by $1.2 trillion over the past two years but remains willing to talk about more cuts, including some to Medicare.

Still, the president acknowledged the Republican-controlled House likely has enough votes to demand spending cuts be part of the debate, which would result in no increase to the debt limit and the county defaulting on its bills.

The House nearly did that in summer 2011.

The chamber returns to negotiate with the Democrat-controlled Senate and the White House on three fiscal matters with looming deadlines: the debt ceiling, massive federal spending cuts known as sequester and a budget resolution.

The talks resume because Washington again failed after the November elections to reach a long-term solution to the country’s debt and deficit issues.

Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said Obama and his allies need to get serious about spending and that the debt limit debate is “the perfect time for it.”

The Kentucky senator also called the county’s debt and deficit a “huge, huge problem.""

On a question about Obama nominating only men to his Cabinet for his second term, the president told critics to wait until his selections are complete “before they rush to justice.”",www.foxnews.com,right,LTZbYnGLDou8zAJh

There's a lot of searching on Capitol Hill but no discovery yet of a way to avoid a federal government shutdown at the start of next month.

Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor are searching for enough House GOP votes for a spending bill that could pass in the Democratic-controlled Senate and keep the government open past Sept. 30.

Democrats are searching for a way to end the sequester budget cuts, or failing that, to pass a spending bill for the new fiscal year starting Oct. 1 that funds the government at a higher level than Republicans want.

But in recent days some Republicans have questioned how bad the situation would be and others, as well as some market analysts, have suggested there is more time to negotiate over a debt limit hike than Treasury has stated.

“It is irresponsible and reckless to insist that we experience a forced default to learn how bad it is,” Lew told the Senate Finance Committee. “If anything at all is learned from the shutdown, it will convince the deniers – or a majority who can work their will – to avoid putting the entire economy at risk in the name of an ideological fight.”

Republicans have been critical of Lew, arguing he is trying to scare financial markets to get Congress to boost the debt ceiling without attaching a budget deal or changes to the president’s health care law to the legislation.

Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) told Lew at Thursday’s hearing that he and President Barack Obama have been causing needless panic with suggestions that Social Security recipients and disabled workers would see deep cuts without an increase in the debt limit while failing to explain how the government could manage a default.

President Obama and Republican leaders have already made public statements about whether taxes and cuts will be part of negotiations on the debt ceiling . But on Sunday , the sides drew clean battle lines and on one occasion went face-to-face on the issue .
Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan told “ Fox News Sunday ” that Democrats got the revenue increases they wanted before Congress adjourned , but won ’ t come through on promised federal spending cuts when lawmakers try to address other fiscal problems before their deadlines hit over roughly the next eight weeks .
“ There are no cuts in there , ” Jordan said . “ It ’ s the same old , same old . … These are promises from politicians . ”
Much of the debate has focused on Obama saying cuts would not be part of the debt ceiling debate , and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell saying the president must include discussions on spending cuts .
Maryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen , the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee , told “ Fox News Sunday ” that McConnell ’ s “ line in the sand ” is going to be a “ recipe for more gridlock . ”
“ This is crazy , ” Jordan added as he and Van Hollen repeatedly talked over each other for several minutes .

President Obama and Republican leaders have already made public statements about whether taxes and cuts will be part of negotiations on the debt ceiling. But on Sunday, the sides drew clean battle lines and on one occasion went face-to-face on the issue.

Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan told “Fox News Sunday” that Democrats got the revenue increases they wanted before Congress adjourned, but won’t come through on promised federal spending cuts when lawmakers try to address other fiscal problems before their deadlines hit over roughly the next eight weeks.

“There are no cuts in there,” Jordan said. “It’s the same old, same old. … These are promises from politicians.”

Much of the debate has focused on Obama saying cuts would not be part of the debt ceiling debate, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell saying the president must include discussions on spending cuts.

Maryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, told “Fox News Sunday” that McConnell’s “line in the sand” is going to be a “recipe for more gridlock.”

Jordan argued that McConnell is “exactly right.”

“This is crazy,” Jordan added as he and Van Hollen repeatedly talked over each other for several minutes.

“Aw, goodness,” Van Hollen muttered at the end of their debate.

McConnell appeared to strengthen his position Sunday, appearing on several morning talk shows to say tax increases will not be included in new agreements.

“The tax issue is over, finished completely,” the Kentucky senator said on ABC’s “This Week.” “That’s behind us now. The question is: What are we going to do about the biggest problem confronting us and our future?”

And then there are the other Democrats — the ones who reject the entire premise of the current high-stakes fiscal fight. There’s no short-term deficit problem, they say, and there isn’t even an urgent debt crisis that requires immediate attention. This group could make it even harder for President Barack Obama to strike a grand bargain because they increasingly see no immediate need for either new spending cuts or significantly more revenue, both of which they say could further slow the economy.

These Democrats and their intellectual allies once occupied the political fringes, pushed aside by more moderate members who supported both immediate spending cuts and long-term entitlement reforms along with higher taxes.

But aided by a pile of recent data suggesting the deficit is already shrinking significantly and current spending cuts are slowing the economy, more Democrats such as Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine and Maryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen are coming around to the point of view that fiscal austerity, in all its forms, is more the problem than the solution.

This group got a huge boost this month with the very public demolition of a sacred text of the austerity movement, the 2010 paper by a pair of Harvard professors arguing that once debt exceeds 90 percent of a country’s gross domestic product, it crushes economic growth.

Turns out that’s not what the research really showed. The original findings were skewed by a spreadsheet error, among other mistakes, and it’s helping shift the manner in which even middle-of-the-road Democrats talk about debt and deficits.

“Trying to just land on the debt too quickly would really harm the economy; I’m convinced of that,” Kaine, hardly a wild-eyed liberal, said in an interview. “Jobs and growth should be No. 1. Economic growth is the best anti-deficit strategy.”

And the intellectual shift away from austerity is not just coming from the left.

The conservative American Enterprise Institute issued a paper last week saying Congress has already achieved enough deficit reduction for now. Other organizations not typically associated with free-spending liberalism, including the International Monetary Fund and Goldman Sachs, have cautioned that the austerity movement — which favors rapid reduction of national debt — may be worsening Europe’s economic problems and slowing down the U.S. recovery, as well.

federal_budget,Wall Street Journal - News,1,https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-budget-likely-to-see-major-rewrite-in-congress-1489712097,Trump Budget Likely to See Major Rewrite in Congress,,"Ted Mann, Dante Chinni, Siobhan Hughes, Ted.Mann Wsj.Com, Siobhan.Hughes Wsj.Com","Republicans were quick to lodge objections on Thursday to President Donald Trump ’ s budget plans , many of which trim away smaller programs that help the sort of local communities he vowed to rejuvenate during the campaign .
The response suggests Mr. Trump ’ s first blueprint for federal spending , like many before his , is likely to undergo a major rewrite by Congress .
While Republicans lawmakers embraced the president ’ s impulses to boost military spending by cutting what some consider wasteful programs , they then began scouring through the fine print for details about school-enrichment , environmental cleanup and other programs . That ’ s when they immediately began planning to shift the burden of cutbacks elsewhere .
Republican leadership , including House Speaker Paul Ryan gave a muted endorsement . Mr. Ryan said that Mr. Trump ’ s proposal marked only the beginning of the budget process . “ We ’ ll have a full hearing about how priorities will be met , ” Mr. Ryan said . “ But , do I think we can cut spending and get waste out of government ? Absolutely . Where and how and what numbers , that ’ s something we ’ ll be figuring out as time goes on . ”
Steve Bell , a longtime budget aide who is now a senior adviser at the Bipartisan Policy Center , said the proposal had no chance of passing Congress .
“ It is a budget that is more for messaging and public relation purposes for the Republican base than it is as a serious effort , ” he said . He added that the spending proposal would “ hit places that even many Republicans think is inappropriate . ”
Sen . Rob Portman ( R. , Ohio ) issued a forceful objection to the proposal to eliminate the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative , a program funded through the Environmental Protection Agency aimed at cleaning up a cluster of lakes along the northern border .
The proposed cuts could have some of their most profound effects in areas where Mr. Trump racked up his largest margins of victory last fall : the country ’ s rural , economically challenged regions . Take the Appalachian Regional Commission , a $ 146 million economic development and workforce training agency dating to the antipoverty reforms of President Lyndon Johnson , whose coverage area stretches from New York to northern Mississippi . Of the 420 counties in 13 states served by the commission , Mr. Trump won 399 of them , trouncing Democrat Hillary Clinton . Across the Appalachian region , Mr. Trump won 63 % of the vote , compared with 33 % for Mrs. Clinton .
The commission , which was authorized to receive $ 146 million in federal funds in 2016 , is one of 19 independent agencies and partnerships that would be eliminated from the federal budget , to save $ 2.7 billion . Agencies targeted include the Environmental Protection Agency , the Department of Health and Human Services and the State Department .
Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney Thursday argued the cuts to programs used to give meals for seniors and students were “ compassionate ” because they will reduce the tax burden on many Americans . The U.S. government can ’ t afford to continue to fund programs “ just because they sound good , ” he said .
“ Regarding the question as to climate change , ” Mr. Mulvaney said , “ I think the President was fairly straightforward—we ’ re not spending money on that anymore ; we consider that to be a waste of your money to go out and do that . So that is a specific tie to his campaign . ”
Mr. Bell said many of the services proposed to take major hits in the Trump budget—from nutritional assistance to women and children , to supplemental education grants—primarily benefit white and rural communities like those that supported Mr. Trump .
“ A lot of people came out of rural America because of government programs , and the vast majority of them were white , ” Mr. Bell said . “ You ’ re starting to really cut at the idea of equalizing the chance of a young person from Darien , Conn. , and somebody from Palestine , W.Va. , having an equal chance of getting to college . And I think that ’ s going to hurt ” Republicans .
History shows that presidents have a hard time realizing the most ambitious of their budget-cutting plans . President Ronald Reagan proposed eliminating the Department of Education , without success .
At the same time , Mr. Reagan ’ s record shows that Congress can be cajoled to endorse deep spending cuts . Mr. Reagan won $ 35.2 billion worth of cuts from projected fiscal 1982 spending levels in his first-ever budget battle , cutting the school-lunch program and arts funding .
But weeks after he had signed those reductions into law , Congress balked at a new request for $ 13 billion in cuts , and Mr. Reagan had to settle for only $ 4 billion .
“ In general , the U.S. government does things incrementally , so big changes seldom happen unless there ’ s a crisis , “ said analyst Stan Collender , who tracks the U.S. budget . “ It ’ s even harder to make big changes now , because we ’ ve had about a decade of steady pressure budgets of agencies , and if they ’ re still around at this point , they just have the political support to stick around. “
Some Republicans say voters will cheer Mr. Trump ’ s cuts , even if they feel the impact of them in the very towns that helped to elect him president .
“ I think the Trump supporters expected President Trump to slash the federal government very significantly , ” said Ed Brookover , a longtime Republican strategist who briefly worked for Mr. Trump ’ s campaign last year . “ They ’ re not the kinds of folks who look to Washington for solutions to all their problems . ”
Yet Mr. Trump ’ s budget comes after his embrace of a House bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act that has alarmed some Republicans , and such moderate Democrats as Sen. Joe Manchin ( D. , W.Va. ) , who say the party could face serious political backlash from the same working-class voters if it pulls back health care without providing an adequate replacement .
Mr. Manchin said in an interview on MSNBC ’ s “ Morning Joe ” this week that he had told Mr. Trump that he could be blamed by voters for pulling back the Medicaid expansion that was a part of the Affordable Care Act , also known as Obamacare .
“ Those people don ’ t know how they got these services , ” Mr. Manchin said he told Mr. Trump . “ They didn ’ t know it was the Democrats . They didn ’ t know it was President Obama . They had no idea . But let me tell you , Mr. President , they ’ re going to know who took it away from them . They will know if they lose it . ”
The administration ’ s call to eliminate the Community Development Block Grant Program , which is run out of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and supports local efforts from infrastructure building to Meals on Wheels , the food program for senior citizens , also drew resistance .
“ Everybody thinks that ’ s going to Detroit and Cleveland , but the fact of the matter is there are a lot of cities in Appalachia and elsewhere that really need community development block grants , ” Mr. Bell said .
The White House says it can save $ 3 billion a year by killing the program . “ The Federal Government has spent over $ 150 billion on this block grant since its inception in 1974 , but the program is not well-targeted to the poorest populations and has not demonstrated results , ” the administration ’ s budget blueprint says . But among the those who criticized the cut was Rep. Bruce Poliquin ( R. , Maine ) , whose district favored Mr. Trump by 10 percentage points .
In rural Tennessee , the CDBG program is vital for building and maintaining water and sewer infrastructure , especially in small , rural towns with no other ready sources of funding , said Mike Harrison , executive director of the Association of County Mayors in the state .
“ It ’ s spread out , but obviously our more rural counties would be impacted more with the loss of those funds , ” he said . “ They really depend on those . ”
The proposed cuts in the White House budget would also hit the Denali Commission , which develops infrastructure and health-care facilities in rural Alaska , a state Mr. Trump won easily ; and the Delta Regional Authority , which promotes economic development in a region of 10 million people around the Mississippi River and the deep red precincts of the South .
Trump won 198 of the 252 counties in the Delta Regional Authority , carrying the vote there by 56 % compared with 40 % for Mrs. Clinton .
The blueprint also targets programs important to the constituencies of moderate Republicans and those with large rural constituencies , who expressed alarm at cuts in money to support air-travel to rural airport and other programs .
House Transportation Committee Chairman Bill Shuster ( R. , Pa. ) and Sen. Lisa Murkowski ( R. , Alaska ) both warned about plans to eliminate the Essential Air Service program , which subsidizes flights to rural airports . Mr. Shuster has an airport in Altoona , Pa. , that would be affected , as would 60 communities in Ms. Murkowski ’ s state .
“ While I support the president ’ s emphasis on a strong national defense , I can not support many of the proposed cuts , ” Ms. Murkowski said in a statement . “ We need to remember that these programs are not the primary drivers of our debt , and to look at the full budget to find the best ways to reduce federal spending . ”
In Pennsylvania , Republican Rep. Lou Barletta vowed to protect funding for 21st Century Community Learning Centers , which are grants for after-school programs that the budget proposes eliminating to save $ 1.2 billion , and for grants provided through the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help mitigate the impact of natural disasters .

The response suggests Mr. Trump’s first blueprint for federal spending, like many before his, is likely to undergo a major rewrite by Congress.

While Republicans lawmakers embraced the president’s impulses to boost military spending by cutting what some consider wasteful programs, they then began scouring through the fine print for details about school-enrichment, environmental cleanup and other programs. That’s when they immediately began planning to shift the burden of cutbacks elsewhere.

Republican leadership, including House Speaker Paul Ryan gave a muted endorsement. Mr. Ryan said that Mr. Trump’s proposal marked only the beginning of the budget process. “We’ll have a full hearing about how priorities will be met,” Mr. Ryan said. “But, do I think we can cut spending and get waste out of government? Absolutely. Where and how and what numbers, that’s something we’ll be figuring out as time goes on.”

Steve Bell, a longtime budget aide who is now a senior adviser at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said the proposal had no chance of passing Congress.

“It is a budget that is more for messaging and public relation purposes for the Republican base than it is as a serious effort,” he said. He added that the spending proposal would “hit places that even many Republicans think is inappropriate.”

Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio) issued a forceful objection to the proposal to eliminate the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, a program funded through the Environmental Protection Agency aimed at cleaning up a cluster of lakes along the northern border.

The proposed cuts could have some of their most profound effects in areas where Mr. Trump racked up his largest margins of victory last fall: the country’s rural, economically challenged regions. Take the Appalachian Regional Commission, a $146 million economic development and workforce training agency dating to the antipoverty reforms of President Lyndon Johnson, whose coverage area stretches from New York to northern Mississippi. Of the 420 counties in 13 states served by the commission, Mr. Trump won 399 of them, trouncing Democrat Hillary Clinton. Across the Appalachian region, Mr. Trump won 63% of the vote, compared with 33% for Mrs. Clinton.

The commission, which was authorized to receive $146 million in federal funds in 2016, is one of 19 independent agencies and partnerships that would be eliminated from the federal budget, to save $2.7 billion. Agencies targeted include the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Health and Human Services and the State Department.

Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney Thursday argued the cuts to programs used to give meals for seniors and students were “compassionate” because they will reduce the tax burden on many Americans. The U.S. government can’t afford to continue to fund programs “just because they sound good,” he said.

“Regarding the question as to climate change,” Mr. Mulvaney said, “I think the President was fairly straightforward—we’re not spending money on that anymore; we consider that to be a waste of your money to go out and do that. So that is a specific tie to his campaign.”

Mr. Bell said many of the services proposed to take major hits in the Trump budget—from nutritional assistance to women and children, to supplemental education grants—primarily benefit white and rural communities like those that supported Mr. Trump.

“A lot of people came out of rural America because of government programs, and the vast majority of them were white,” Mr. Bell said. “You’re starting to really cut at the idea of equalizing the chance of a young person from Darien, Conn., and somebody from Palestine, W.Va., having an equal chance of getting to college. And I think that’s going to hurt” Republicans.

History shows that presidents have a hard time realizing the most ambitious of their budget-cutting plans. President Ronald Reagan proposed eliminating the Department of Education, without success.

At the same time, Mr. Reagan’s record shows that Congress can be cajoled to endorse deep spending cuts. Mr. Reagan won $35.2 billion worth of cuts from projected fiscal 1982 spending levels in his first-ever budget battle, cutting the school-lunch program and arts funding.

But weeks after he had signed those reductions into law, Congress balked at a new request for $13 billion in cuts, and Mr. Reagan had to settle for only $4 billion.

“In general, the U.S. government does things incrementally, so big changes seldom happen unless there’s a crisis,“ said analyst Stan Collender, who tracks the U.S. budget. “It’s even harder to make big changes now, because we’ve had about a decade of steady pressure budgets of agencies, and if they’re still around at this point, they just have the political support to stick around.“

Some Republicans say voters will cheer Mr. Trump’s cuts, even if they feel the impact of them in the very towns that helped to elect him president.

“I think the Trump supporters expected President Trump to slash the federal government very significantly,” said Ed Brookover, a longtime Republican strategist who briefly worked for Mr. Trump’s campaign last year. “They’re not the kinds of folks who look to Washington for solutions to all their problems.”

Yet Mr. Trump’s budget comes after his embrace of a House bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act that has alarmed some Republicans, and such moderate Democrats as Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.), who say the party could face serious political backlash from the same working-class voters if it pulls back health care without providing an adequate replacement.

Mr. Manchin said in an interview on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” this week that he had told Mr. Trump that he could be blamed by voters for pulling back the Medicaid expansion that was a part of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.

“Those people don’t know how they got these services,” Mr. Manchin said he told Mr. Trump. “They didn’t know it was the Democrats. They didn’t know it was President Obama. They had no idea. But let me tell you, Mr. President, they’re going to know who took it away from them. They will know if they lose it.”

The administration’s call to eliminate the Community Development Block Grant Program, which is run out of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and supports local efforts from infrastructure building to Meals on Wheels, the food program for senior citizens, also drew resistance.

“Everybody thinks that’s going to Detroit and Cleveland, but the fact of the matter is there are a lot of cities in Appalachia and elsewhere that really need community development block grants,” Mr. Bell said.

The White House says it can save $3 billion a year by killing the program. “The Federal Government has spent over $150 billion on this block grant since its inception in 1974, but the program is not well-targeted to the poorest populations and has not demonstrated results,” the administration’s budget blueprint says. But among the those who criticized the cut was Rep. Bruce Poliquin (R., Maine), whose district favored Mr. Trump by 10 percentage points.

In rural Tennessee, the CDBG program is vital for building and maintaining water and sewer infrastructure, especially in small, rural towns with no other ready sources of funding, said Mike Harrison, executive director of the Association of County Mayors in the state.

“It’s spread out, but obviously our more rural counties would be impacted more with the loss of those funds,” he said. “They really depend on those.”

The proposed cuts in the White House budget would also hit the Denali Commission, which develops infrastructure and health-care facilities in rural Alaska, a state Mr. Trump won easily; and the Delta Regional Authority, which promotes economic development in a region of 10 million people around the Mississippi River and the deep red precincts of the South.

Trump won 198 of the 252 counties in the Delta Regional Authority, carrying the vote there by 56% compared with 40% for Mrs. Clinton.

The blueprint also targets programs important to the constituencies of moderate Republicans and those with large rural constituencies, who expressed alarm at cuts in money to support air-travel to rural airport and other programs.

House Transportation Committee Chairman Bill Shuster (R., Pa.) and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska) both warned about plans to eliminate the Essential Air Service program, which subsidizes flights to rural airports. Mr. Shuster has an airport in Altoona, Pa., that would be affected, as would 60 communities in Ms. Murkowski’s state.

“While I support the president’s emphasis on a strong national defense, I cannot support many of the proposed cuts,” Ms. Murkowski said in a statement. “We need to remember that these programs are not the primary drivers of our debt, and to look at the full budget to find the best ways to reduce federal spending.”

In Pennsylvania, Republican Rep. Lou Barletta vowed to protect funding for 21st Century Community Learning Centers, which are grants for after-school programs that the budget proposes eliminating to save $1.2 billion, and for grants provided through the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help mitigate the impact of natural disasters.

“There’s always room for negotiations,” said Mr. Barletta, an early Trump supporter. “We’re going to look through line item by line item and see where we can encourage more spending.”

Not every Republican was unsettled; some said their districts would come out ahead. Rep. Rob Bishop (R., Utah) said the budget “brings an element of stability back into the government process” because it strives for balance.

“If there’s more cuts in this process that helps the military out, Utah should be better off,” Mr. Bishop said.

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump called for deep cuts in environmental and safety net programs, billions more for his border wall and a huge boost for the military in a $4.75 trillion 2020 budget proposal that is unlikely to gain traction in Congress.

Trump delivered his first budget under a divided government Monday, a road map that would not balance the books for 15 years despite deep reductions. The proposal also called for $8.6 billion for Trump's border wall, a request Democrats flatly rejected.

""Congress has been ignoring the president's spending reductions for the last two years,"" Trump's top budget aide, Russell Vought, told reporters when pressed for an explanation about why the budget anticipates a $1.1 trillion deficit next year.

Even before Democrats claimed control of the House, similar proposals by Trump failed in Congress. The schism between the president's wish list and actual government spending only deepened after a dispute over the border wall led to a 35-day partial government shutdown that ended in January.

""This is not a serious proposal,"" said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Presidential budgets, required by the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, for decades have had more to do with politics than policy. With the 2020 election underway, the document gives Trump an opportunity to lay out a vision he can trumpet to supporters.

Not your budget:'Get rid of the fat': Why Uncle Sam's budget is different from yours

What Trump wants

The White House is eager to sell three messages with the president's third budget: that Trump hasn’t given up on building his long-promised border wall, that he wants to increase military spending and that he hopes to slash just about everything else.

The president requested $8.6 billion more for his wall, just weeks after Congress failed to approve his demand for $5.7 billion. With both sides dug in on the issue, the latest proposal is certain to go nowhere. Trump declared a national emergency in February, a move the White House says will free up billions more for the wall.

Trump is also requesting billions more in spending at the Defense Department – one of the few priorities that could gain some attention from lawmakers. After initially considering Pentagon cuts last year, the White House embraced a proposal to increase the Defense Department’s budget 5 percent to $750 billion.

Other proposals include:

• A $2.8 billion, or 31 percent reduction in for the Environmental Protection Agency and a $327 billion cut to safety-net programs. Some of that reduction would be carried out by imposing a work requirement for food stamps, Medicaid and other programs.

• A new user fee on e-cigarettes and other electronic nicotine delivery system products to ""address today’s alarming rise in youth e-cigarette use.""

• Nearly $315 million to hire an additional 1,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and 128 immigration court prosecuting attorneys.

• Almost $300 million toward the goal eliminating nearly all new infections of HIV/AIDS within 10 years.

Why it won't happen

Some proposals in Trump's budget could become law, but most of the high-profile items will face tough odds.

Trump has proposed many of the same changes before, without success. Last year’s budget, which came at a time when Republicans controlled both the House and Senate, included $18 billion for the border wall. His 2017 budget proposed eliminating 62 federal agencies entirely. Congress largely ignored those requests and many others.

None of those agencies was eliminated and lawmakers approved only $1.37 billion for border barriers. That partly reflects a politically divided Congress but also the fact that the president's budget has long been viewed as a wish list.

Government printers published about 20,000 hard copies of the president's budget, and a spokesman for the Government Publishing Office says the online version of the document averages about 2 million retrievals each year.

The budget proposal must include information about how much the government collected in taxes and other revenue, the public debt and proposed spending priorities. But the real work of spending taxpayer money is handled by the congressional appropriations process. And that means Democrats and Republicans must work together to decide which programs should be prioritized.

Even some Republicans remained noncommittal about the White House proposal.

The president spoke Tuesday at the White House , urging Congress to come up with a short-term fix to cancel sweeping cuts to defense and other programs set to hit March 1 .
`` These cuts are not smart . They are not fair . They will hurt our economy . They will add hundreds of thousands of Americans to the unemployment rolls , '' Obama said . `` This is not an abstraction -- people will lose their jobs . ''
The president ticked off a host of expected repercussions should the $ 85 billion in cuts for this year take effect . He said Border Patrol , emergency responders , FBI agents , airport controllers and others would all face cutbacks . He said teachers would be laid off by the thousands and America 's military would be degraded .
As he has before , Obama urged Congress to pass a stopgap to allow for more time to pass a bigger package . But , with Congress out this week and many lawmakers resisting another attempt to kick the can on the cuts , Obama tried to cast Republicans as the ones responsible .
Obama suggested their resistance to his calls to pass a `` balanced '' package -- by closing tax loopholes for top earners and big corporations -- is the hold-up . He asked whether Republicans are willing to let hundreds of thousands of people lose their jobs `` just to protect a few special-interest tax loopholes . ''
He blamed the current stalemate on `` partisan recklessness and ideological rigidity . ''
House Speaker John Boehner , after Obama talked , claimed Obama was merely reinforcing what Republicans have been saying -- `` his sequester is the wrong way to cut spending . '' Boehner and others note the so-called sequester -- which set up more than $ 1 trillion in sweeping spending cuts if Congress failed , as it did , to reach a compromise on deficit reduction -- originated in the White House .
`` But once again , the president offered no credible plan that can pass Congress -- only more calls for higher taxes , '' Boehner said .
White House Press Secretary Jay Carney acknowledged that the idea was originally `` put forward '' by the White House . But he said the White House only pitched it as an `` absolute necessity '' in 2011 to avoid default over the debt ceiling , and noted Republicans `` embraced '' it at the time .
Shortly before he spoke , Obama was also dealt a blunt warning by former Republican Sen. Alan Simpson , who co-chaired the president 's deficit-reduction commission .
Simpson warned that Obama `` will have a failed presidency '' unless he deals `` honestly '' with entitlements , saying programs like Medicare and Social Security must be dealt with in order to get the country on a sustainable path .
`` If he wants to leave it alone and not deal with those two biggies , forget the rest of the stuff -- he 'll have a failed presidency , '' Simpson told Fox News .
While Obama says opposition to tax hikes is holding up a deal , Republicans say Democrats ' resistance to major changes to entitlements are a big part of the problem .
Simpson and Erskine Bowles , the former co-chairmen of the president 's deficit-reduction commission who for years have been urging Washington to stop kicking the can , got in front of the president early Tuesday morning to push a plan of their own .
`` Over the medium and long-term , our debt is projected to continue growing faster than the economy . It is simply on an unsustainable path , '' they said in a statement .
The two fiscal hawks pitched a plan to avert the looming spending cuts -- heavy cuts to defense and other programs that they describe as `` abrupt '' and `` mindless '' -- and instead enact a $ 2.4 trillion deficit reduction plan over 10 years .
A quarter would come from changes to health care spending , a quarter would come from closing tax loopholes and the rest would come from spending reductions including a stingier adjustment of Social Security 's cost of living increases .
On tax reform , the plan presents a middle ground -- by using the savings from closing loopholes to both lower rates and bring down the deficit . By contrast , Obama has pushed to use that savings mostly to reduce the deficit , while Republicans have pushed to use it to bring down rates .
Simpson and Bowles cast their plan as building on the proposal from the president 's deficit commission -- a plan that Congress never adopted and Obama never fully endorsed .
Obama , fresh off a three-day Florida golfing trip , pressed his own case during the event at the White House Tuesday morning . Emergency responders , a group of workers the White House says could be affected if state and local governments lose federal money as a result of the cuts , joined him .
The $ 85 billion in cuts , known as the sequester , will start taking effect on March 1 unless Congress acts . The White House says the sequester could derail an economy still suffering from high unemployment and sluggish growth .
Obama wants to offset the sequester through a combination of targeted spending cuts and increased tax revenue . The White House is backing a proposal unveiled last week by Senate Democrats that is in line with the president 's principles .
But that plan was met with an icy reception by Republicans , who oppose raising more tax revenue in order to offset the cuts . GOP leaders say the president got the tax increases he wanted at the beginning of the year when Congress agreed to raise taxes on family income exceeding $ 450,000 a year .
A senior administration official later insisted the White House is not looking to raise tax rates for top earners , but does want to close deductions .
The official indicated the White House expects Republicans to eventually allow this despite statements to the contrary . Still , the White House sees the March 1 cuts as a real possibility , warning that the economic impact will be ugly .
The Democrats propose to generate revenue by plugging some tax loopholes . Those include tax breaks for the oil and natural gas industry and businesses that have sent jobs overseas , and by taxing millionaires at a rate of at least 30 percent .
Some Republicans , including House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan , R-Wis. , have advocated plugging loopholes , but as part of a discussion on a tax overhaul , not sequestration .
`` Loopholes are necessary for tax reform , '' Ryan said Sunday on ABC 's `` This Week . '' ` 'If you take them for spending , you 're blocking tax reform and you 're really not getting the deficit under control . ''
The sequester was first set to begin taking effect on Jan. 1 . But as part of the `` fiscal cliff '' negotiations , the White House and lawmakers agreed to push it off for two months in order to create space to work on a larger budget deal .","President Obama pinned the blame on Republicans Tuesday for looming spending cuts that may be triggered by what was originally a White House proposal -- while a former leader of the president's deficit commission said it's Obama who's on the path to a ""failed presidency"" if he can't tackle the debt.

He asked whether Republicans are willing to let hundreds of thousands of people lose their jobs ""just to protect a few special-interest tax loopholes.""

He blamed the current stalemate on ""partisan recklessness and ideological rigidity.""

House Speaker John Boehner, after Obama talked, claimed Obama was merely reinforcing what Republicans have been saying -- ""his sequester is the wrong way to cut spending."" Boehner and others note the so-called sequester -- which set up more than $1 trillion in sweeping spending cuts if Congress failed, as it did, to reach a compromise on deficit reduction -- originated in the White House.

""But once again, the president offered no credible plan that can pass Congress -- only more calls for higher taxes,"" Boehner said.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney acknowledged that the idea was originally ""put forward"" by the White House. But he said the White House only pitched it as an ""absolute necessity"" in 2011 to avoid default over the debt ceiling, and noted Republicans ""embraced"" it at the time.

Shortly before he spoke, Obama was also dealt a blunt warning by former Republican Sen. Alan Simpson, who co-chaired the president's deficit-reduction commission.

Simpson warned that Obama ""will have a failed presidency"" unless he deals ""honestly"" with entitlements, saying programs like Medicare and Social Security must be dealt with in order to get the country on a sustainable path.

""If he wants to leave it alone and not deal with those two biggies, forget the rest of the stuff -- he'll have a failed presidency,"" Simpson told Fox News.

While Obama says opposition to tax hikes is holding up a deal, Republicans say Democrats' resistance to major changes to entitlements are a big part of the problem.

Simpson and Erskine Bowles, the former co-chairmen of the president's deficit-reduction commission who for years have been urging Washington to stop kicking the can, got in front of the president early Tuesday morning to push a plan of their own.

""Over the medium and long-term, our debt is projected to continue growing faster than the economy. It is simply on an unsustainable path,"" they said in a statement.

The two fiscal hawks pitched a plan to avert the looming spending cuts -- heavy cuts to defense and other programs that they describe as ""abrupt"" and ""mindless"" -- and instead enact a $2.4 trillion deficit reduction plan over 10 years.

A quarter would come from changes to health care spending, a quarter would come from closing tax loopholes and the rest would come from spending reductions including a stingier adjustment of Social Security's cost of living increases.

On tax reform, the plan presents a middle ground -- by using the savings from closing loopholes to both lower rates and bring down the deficit. By contrast, Obama has pushed to use that savings mostly to reduce the deficit, while Republicans have pushed to use it to bring down rates.

Simpson and Bowles cast their plan as building on the proposal from the president's deficit commission -- a plan that Congress never adopted and Obama never fully endorsed.

Obama, fresh off a three-day Florida golfing trip, pressed his own case during the event at the White House Tuesday morning. Emergency responders, a group of workers the White House says could be affected if state and local governments lose federal money as a result of the cuts, joined him.

The $85 billion in cuts, known as the sequester, will start taking effect on March 1 unless Congress acts. The White House says the sequester could derail an economy still suffering from high unemployment and sluggish growth.

Obama wants to offset the sequester through a combination of targeted spending cuts and increased tax revenue. The White House is backing a proposal unveiled last week by Senate Democrats that is in line with the president's principles.

But that plan was met with an icy reception by Republicans, who oppose raising more tax revenue in order to offset the cuts. GOP leaders say the president got the tax increases he wanted at the beginning of the year when Congress agreed to raise taxes on family income exceeding $450,000 a year.

A senior administration official later insisted the White House is not looking to raise tax rates for top earners, but does want to close deductions.

The official indicated the White House expects Republicans to eventually allow this despite statements to the contrary. Still, the White House sees the March 1 cuts as a real possibility, warning that the economic impact will be ugly.

The Democrats propose to generate revenue by plugging some tax loopholes. Those include tax breaks for the oil and natural gas industry and businesses that have sent jobs overseas, and by taxing millionaires at a rate of at least 30 percent.

Some Republicans, including House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., have advocated plugging loopholes, but as part of a discussion on a tax overhaul, not sequestration.

""Loopholes are necessary for tax reform,"" Ryan said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" `'If you take them for spending, you're blocking tax reform and you're really not getting the deficit under control.""

The sequester was first set to begin taking effect on Jan. 1. But as part of the ""fiscal cliff"" negotiations, the White House and lawmakers agreed to push it off for two months in order to create space to work on a larger budget deal.

It's going to be another ugly fall in Washington.

The federal government runs out of money on Oct. 1, unless spending authority is granted to agencies for the new fiscal year. If Congress can't pass its spending bills by then, most of the government will shut down.

It's no empty threat. Many who watch the budget process closely think there's a very good chance that's exactly what's going to happen.

""I'm afraid it's more likely than not,"" says Scott Lilly, a former Democratic staff director on the House Appropriations Committee. ""How much time has to pass before Congress finds out that people are really angry?""

Action in both the Senate and House prior to the current congressional recess suggests that any sort of a deal is a long way away. And the two chambers will be in session together a total of only nine days before the deadline.

The House and Senate are currently about $90 billion apart in terms of total spending. As if that wasn't challenging enough, Congress will also have to grapple with the politically charged issue of raising the nation's debt ceiling sometime in the fall.

House Speaker John Boehner has said he'll insist on spending cuts equal to any increase in the debt limit. Regardless of whether he holds to that, it's going to be a challenge to find enough votes in the House GOP majority to vote for any sort of a budget package that the Democratic-controlled Senate will also approve — and that President Obama will sign.

Steep and harsh federal spending cuts kick in Friday.

And that’s when President Barack Obama has invited Congressional leaders to the White House to try and resolve the standoff.

Story Continued Below

The White House on Tuesday invited House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to trek down Pennsylvania Avenue to meet on the $85 billion across-the-board cuts, known as the sequester.

Republicans on Capitol Hill say the last-minute invitation to the White House Tuesday for a Friday meeting is a sign that the president is not serious about stopping the cuts.

The Senate is set to unveil competing plans — one Republican and one Democratic — to stop and perhaps give Obama more flexibility to reprogram the spending cuts in the sequester. But those measures, which will get a vote on Thursday, both are expected to need a 60-vote threshold in the Senate, and both are expected to fail.

The White House said Wednesday that it doesn’t expect anything to come of the Senate votes, and press secretary Jay Carney sought to blame Republicans for the massive cuts that will ensue.

“Obviously the Senate will vote on proposals — or at least one proposal that would eliminate, or rather postpone, the deadline for the sequester — a balanced proposal that the president supports, a balanced proposal that a majority of the Senate will support, unfortunately a proposal that, while earning a majority vote is likely to be blocked by Republican leaders who will thereby be making a choice that we should let the sequester go into effect rather than ask that some special interest tax breaks be eliminated,” Carney said.

“Hopefully that won’t come to pass but certainly, based on what we’ve seen from Republicans thus far, that is a more likely outcome.”

The president spoke briefly with the top four Hill leaders during a statue dedication ceremony for Rosa Parks at the Capitol Wednesday, but Carney didn’t indicate progress. He reiterated the White House’s insistence that revenues be part of any deal and excoriated Republicans for failing to even consider then.

Boehner says `` clean '' spending bill ca n't pass ; Obama says prove it
Investors nervous over fiscal impasse as stocks fall on Wall Street
Is it a glimmer of hope , or more rhetoric as the deadline for possible government default gets closer ?
After weeks of near silence without any hint of a potential compromise between the Obama administration and congressional Republicans over raising the nation 's debt ceiling , the White House may be offering some conciliatory language that could help lead to a deal to prevent a potential default on October 17 .
As recently as Friday , White House officials declined to specify any demand for the length of a deal to increase the nation 's debt ceiling .
Then on Monday , a White House official said it was up to Congress to decide how long the debt ceiling increase should last .
`` It is up to Congress to pass a debt limit increase , and up to them for how long and when they want to deal with this again , '' the official told CNN . `` We have been super clear we think longer is better because it lends more certainty . ''
With parts of the government shut down for a week and counting , the focus of ending a deepening political stalemate is shifting to the upcoming deadline to increase how much the federal government can borrow . The reference to the length of a debt ceiling deal caused speculation that the White House might be signaling flexibility on the issue to legislators .

JUST WATCHED Shutdown drags on , debt ceiling looms Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Shutdown drags on , debt ceiling looms 02:09
JUST WATCHED A standstill in the nation 's capital Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH A standstill in the nation 's capital 09:51
However , President Barack Obama reiterated Monday that he will not negotiate with Congress while the country was under threat of a possible debt default .
`` We 're not going to establish that pattern , '' Obama said , adding that `` we 're not going to negotiate under the threat of a prolonged shutdown until Republicans get 100 % of what they want '' or under the threat of `` economic catastrophe . ''
White House spokesman Jay Carney later told reporters that `` I 'm not ruling out '' a debt ceiling increase of any particular length of time . But he said he believed a longer one was better , because it would provide certainty after what Obama characterized as `` manufactured crises '' over similar brinksmanship in recent years .
`` Our position is only that it ought not to be a political football , because it 's a dangerous political football , '' Carney said . `` And you know , fumbling that football can cost you a lot more than seven points . It can tank the economy . ''
Economists warn of dire fiscal impacts from failing to raise what is called the debt ceiling , such as a reduced U.S. credit rating that would spike borrowing costs . The economic blow and questions about America 's fiscal fidelity could bring a global slowdown , Obama has warned .
Analysts blamed concerns over the political impasse for another down day on Wall Street . All three major stock indexes fell , with the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 136 points , or nearly 1 percent .
House Speaker John Boehner said Sunday there will be no debt limit increase and no end to the partial government shutdown that began October 1 , unless Obama and Senate Democrats negotiate a broader agreement with House Republicans .
On Monday , he repeated his accusation that Obama was refusing to hold talks with Republicans , even with the looming threat of a default .
`` The American people expect that when their leaders have differences and we are in a time of crisis that we will sit down and at least have a conversation , '' Boehner said , adding that `` it is time to have that conversation before our economy is put further at risk . ''
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell later said divided government means the two parties have to negotiate solutions .
`` Until Senate Democrats accept that reality , these crises will only be harder to resolve , '' McConnell , R-Kentucky , said .
However , one of Obama 's top economic advisers , Gene Sperling , told a Politico breakfast on Monday that `` the era of threatening default has to be over . ''
`` If you sanction through negotiation the legitimacy of somebody threatening default , then that is going to happen over and over again , '' Sperling said . `` So sanctioning negotiations with someone threatening default is not going to end the risk of default . It is likely to increase the chances that we as a country eventually default or even perpetually threaten our full faith and credit . ''
At issue is how to reach an agreement to fund the government in the newly started fiscal year and raise the $ 16.7 trillion debt limit .
Conservative Republicans intent on shrinking the government while trying to weaken Obamacare demand that any agreement on funding for the new fiscal year and raising the debt limit include their priorities .
`` The debt ceiling is there for a purpose . It 's like the smoke alarm , '' said House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling , R-Texas . `` Democrats want to unplug the smoke alarm , and Republicans want to go out and fight the fire . ''
Boehner insisted that a deal to raise the debt ceiling must include deficit reduction steps that would lower costs of entitlement programs such as Medicare , Medicaid and Social Security .
However , he appeared to move away from the demand of the tea party conservative wing of his GOP caucus to dismantle or defund Obama 's signature health care reforms passed by Democrats in 2010 and upheld by the Supreme Court last year .
`` My goal here is to have a serious conversation about those things that are driving the deficit and driving the debt up , '' Boehner said , noting that the retirement of the `` baby boomer '' generation will strain Social Security and Medicare beyond the breaking point if no remedial steps are taken .
`` It is time to deal with America 's problems , '' he said . `` How can you raise the debt limit and do nothing about the underlying problem ? ''
Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress insist that such congressional responsibilities -- to keep the government running and able to pay its debts -- must be free of partisan political pressure to avoid the kind of collateral damage happening in the current stalemate .
They want what are known as `` clean '' measures to fund the government for a short period and increase the debt limit , with no accompanying provisions involving contentious deficit reduction measures or GOP efforts to weaken Obamacare .
Once such measures are passed , they say , negotiations can take place on a full budget for fiscal year 2014 that began on October 1 and other issues such as reducing spending on entitlement programs like Medicare , Medicaid and Social Security .
Last week , a House Republican said on condition of not being identified that Boehner told GOP colleagues in private meetings he would not allow a government default to occur . But Boehner sounded more combative on Sunday , saying Obama and Senate Democrats refused to negotiate on either a spending plan to end the shutdown or the debt ceiling .
Senate Democrats are expected this week to take up a debt ceiling bill that would not propose any policy changes or spending cuts demanded by Republicans , according to a Senate Democratic leadership aide .
The aide said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid could introduce a `` clean '' bill as early as Monday that could bring a first key procedural vote on Friday .
On the shutdown , Boehner insisted Obama and Democrats were wrong in saying a `` clean '' short-term spending plan to reopen the government would pass in the House with support from some Republicans and most Democrats .
`` There are not the votes in the House to pass a clean CR , '' Boehner said .
Obama rejected Boehner 's contention on Monday , saying the speaker `` should prove it '' by holding the vote .
`` My very strong suspicion is there are enough votes there , '' Obama said , adding that Boehner `` apparently does n't want to see the government shutdown end ... unless he 's able to extract concessions that do n't have anything to do with the budget . ''
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid suggested the measure would pass the House , and that Americans would realize the government was shut down `` for no apparent reason . '' Both Obama and Reid said Democrats were open to negotiate `` anything '' -- with the president specifically mentioning health care -- once the government shutdown ends and the debt ceiling gets increased .
House Republicans , however , fear losing their leverage in any talks by giving up those two points without any concessions .
In a new national poll released Monday , most respondents said the government shutdown was causing a crisis or major problems for the country .
While the CNN/ORC International survey also indicated that slightly more people were angry at Republicans than Democrats or Obama for the shutdown , both sides were taking a hit .
According to the poll conducted over the weekend , 63 % of respondents said they were angry at the Republicans for the way they have handled the shutdown , while 57 % expressed anger at Democrats and 53 % at Obama .
`` It looks like there is more than enough blame to go around and both parties are being hurt by the shutdown , '' said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland .

Boehner says ""clean"" spending bill can't pass; Obama says prove it

Investors nervous over fiscal impasse as stocks fall on Wall Street

CNN/ORC poll shows rising public anger with both sides

Is it a glimmer of hope, or more rhetoric as the deadline for possible government default gets closer?

After weeks of near silence without any hint of a potential compromise between the Obama administration and congressional Republicans over raising the nation's debt ceiling, the White House may be offering some conciliatory language that could help lead to a deal to prevent a potential default on October 17.

As recently as Friday, White House officials declined to specify any demand for the length of a deal to increase the nation's debt ceiling.

Then on Monday, a White House official said it was up to Congress to decide how long the debt ceiling increase should last.

""It is up to Congress to pass a debt limit increase, and up to them for how long and when they want to deal with this again,"" the official told CNN. ""We have been super clear we think longer is better because it lends more certainty.""

With parts of the government shut down for a week and counting, the focus of ending a deepening political stalemate is shifting to the upcoming deadline to increase how much the federal government can borrow. The reference to the length of a debt ceiling deal caused speculation that the White House might be signaling flexibility on the issue to legislators.

Congress and the president are facing off in another supreme spending showdown. This last happened in 2011, when Congress avoided a shutdown by passing a spending measure shortly after the midnight deadline hit. Who controls what happens this time? Take a look at the key players who will determine how this fight ends.

Hide Caption 2 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate – Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio -- The coach. He'll make the key play call. The top Republican leader in the land may be the most important player in the days immediately before a possible shutdown. Boehner could decide whether to push through the Senate's version of a spending bill and keep government running, or he could float a third version with some other Republican wish list items in it. If he takes the second option, Boehner could risk a shutdown but could also force the Senate into a tough position: give House Republicans something or send federal workers home. Timing on all this will be critical. Hide Caption 3 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate – Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas -- The revolutionary or rabble rouser, depending on your viewpoint. The tea party firebrand could lead a long filibuster on the Senate floor, delaying passage of a spending bill until just one day before the deadline on Monday, September 30. Cruz has stoked the anti-Obamacare flames all summer, but recently angered fellow Republicans by openly saying that the Senate does not have the votes to repeal the health care law. Hide Caption 4 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate – Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida -- Senator to watch. The potential presidential candidate has been one of three senators (Cruz and Mike Lee, R-Utah, being the others) pushing to use the government shutdown debate as a way to repeal or defund Obamacare. But watch his actions and language as a shutdown nears to see if he digs in or if downshifts at all. Hide Caption 5 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate – Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nevada -- The man steering the ship in the Senate. Master at using Senate procedure to his advantage, Reid is the main force in controlling the voting process in the chamber and ensuring that an attempted filibuster by tea party-types fails. The majority leader will be a primary negotiator if we reach phase three, if the House does not accept the Senate spending bill. Hide Caption 6 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate – Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky -- If Reid steers the ship, McConnell controls the headwinds. Which is good news for Reid, at least initially. The Republican leader and several of his members say they will vote against Cruz's filibuster and in favor of a spending bill with no limits on Obamacare. Meaning, in favor of a bill that just funds government. McConnell generally has been leery of running into a shutdown or default. In fact, one legislative method for avoiding default is named after him. Hide Caption 7 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate – Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington -- The consigliore. Murray, center, does not seek the outside limelight, but the Senate Budget Committee chairwoman is a major fiscal force behind the scenes on Capitol Hill. Known by fellow Democrats as a straight shooter, she is also an experienced negotiator, having co-chaired the laborious, somewhat torturous and unsuccessful Super Committee. Hide Caption 8 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate – Rep. Tom Graves, R-Georgia -- The new militia leader. The freshman congressman from Georgia, second from right, is one reason the debate has reached this point. Graves led the charge that blocked the original proposal by House Republican leaders. That would have kept government funded and had a detachable portion on Obamacare. Instead Graves and other conservatives forced their leaders to pass a spending bill with a mandatory defunding of Obamacare. Hide Caption 9 of 18 Photos: Photos: Key players in the shutdown debate Key players in the shutdown debate – Rep. Peter King, R-New York -- The blunt statesman. King is outspoken against many tea party tactics, calling the move to tie Obamacare to the must-pass spending bill essentially a suicide mission and Cruz ""a fraud.""

Donohue is known for his deep connections and his aggressive lobbying on behalf of business. He and the Chamber are urging Republican lawmakers to avoid a shutdown. The Chamber is an important political backer for conservatives, but has had mixed success with the current Congress, locking in firm anti-tax positions but unable to push through immigration reform so far.

Expect the president to use his podium more as a shutdown nears, aiming at public opinion as Democrats in Congress position themselves.

However, President Barack Obama reiterated Monday that he will not negotiate with Congress while the country was under threat of a possible debt default.

""We're not going to establish that pattern,"" Obama said, adding that ""we're not going to negotiate under the threat of a prolonged shutdown until Republicans get 100% of what they want"" or under the threat of ""economic catastrophe.""

White House spokesman Jay Carney later told reporters that ""I'm not ruling out"" a debt ceiling increase of any particular length of time. But he said he believed a longer one was better, because it would provide certainty after what Obama characterized as ""manufactured crises"" over similar brinksmanship in recent years.

""Our position is only that it ought not to be a political football, because it's a dangerous political football,"" Carney said. ""And you know, fumbling that football can cost you a lot more than seven points. It can tank the economy.""

Economists warn of dire fiscal impacts from failing to raise what is called the debt ceiling, such as a reduced U.S. credit rating that would spike borrowing costs. The economic blow and questions about America's fiscal fidelity could bring a global slowdown, Obama has warned.

Analysts blamed concerns over the political impasse for another down day on Wall Street. All three major stock indexes fell, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 136 points, or nearly 1 percent.

House Speaker John Boehner said Sunday there will be no debt limit increase and no end to the partial government shutdown that began October 1, unless Obama and Senate Democrats negotiate a broader agreement with House Republicans.

On Monday, he repeated his accusation that Obama was refusing to hold talks with Republicans, even with the looming threat of a default.

""The American people expect that when their leaders have differences and we are in a time of crisis that we will sit down and at least have a conversation,"" Boehner said, adding that ""it is time to have that conversation before our economy is put further at risk.""

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell later said divided government means the two parties have to negotiate solutions.

""Until Senate Democrats accept that reality, these crises will only be harder to resolve,"" McConnell, R-Kentucky, said.

However, one of Obama's top economic advisers, Gene Sperling, told a Politico breakfast on Monday that ""the era of threatening default has to be over.""

""If you sanction through negotiation the legitimacy of somebody threatening default, then that is going to happen over and over again,"" Sperling said. ""So sanctioning negotiations with someone threatening default is not going to end the risk of default. It is likely to increase the chances that we as a country eventually default or even perpetually threaten our full faith and credit.""

At issue is how to reach an agreement to fund the government in the newly started fiscal year and raise the $16.7 trillion debt limit.

Conservative Republicans intent on shrinking the government while trying to weaken Obamacare demand that any agreement on funding for the new fiscal year and raising the debt limit include their priorities.

""The debt ceiling is there for a purpose. It's like the smoke alarm,"" said House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas. ""Democrats want to unplug the smoke alarm, and Republicans want to go out and fight the fire.""

Boehner insisted that a deal to raise the debt ceiling must include deficit reduction steps that would lower costs of entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.

However, he appeared to move away from the demand of the tea party conservative wing of his GOP caucus to dismantle or defund Obama's signature health care reforms passed by Democrats in 2010 and upheld by the Supreme Court last year.

""My goal here is to have a serious conversation about those things that are driving the deficit and driving the debt up,"" Boehner said, noting that the retirement of the ""baby boomer"" generation will strain Social Security and Medicare beyond the breaking point if no remedial steps are taken.

""It is time to deal with America's problems,"" he said. ""How can you raise the debt limit and do nothing about the underlying problem?""

Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress insist that such congressional responsibilities -- to keep the government running and able to pay its debts -- must be free of partisan political pressure to avoid the kind of collateral damage happening in the current stalemate.

They want what are known as ""clean"" measures to fund the government for a short period and increase the debt limit, with no accompanying provisions involving contentious deficit reduction measures or GOP efforts to weaken Obamacare.

Once such measures are passed, they say, negotiations can take place on a full budget for fiscal year 2014 that began on October 1 and other issues such as reducing spending on entitlement programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.

Last week, a House Republican said on condition of not being identified that Boehner told GOP colleagues in private meetings he would not allow a government default to occur. But Boehner sounded more combative on Sunday, saying Obama and Senate Democrats refused to negotiate on either a spending plan to end the shutdown or the debt ceiling.

Senate Democrats are expected this week to take up a debt ceiling bill that would not propose any policy changes or spending cuts demanded by Republicans, according to a Senate Democratic leadership aide.

The aide said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid could introduce a ""clean"" bill as early as Monday that could bring a first key procedural vote on Friday.

On the shutdown, Boehner insisted Obama and Democrats were wrong in saying a ""clean"" short-term spending plan to reopen the government would pass in the House with support from some Republicans and most Democrats.

""There are not the votes in the House to pass a clean CR,"" Boehner said.

Obama rejected Boehner's contention on Monday, saying the speaker ""should prove it"" by holding the vote.

""My very strong suspicion is there are enough votes there,"" Obama said, adding that Boehner ""apparently doesn't want to see the government shutdown end ... unless he's able to extract concessions that don't have anything to do with the budget.""

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid suggested the measure would pass the House, and that Americans would realize the government was shut down ""for no apparent reason."" Both Obama and Reid said Democrats were open to negotiate ""anything"" -- with the president specifically mentioning health care -- once the government shutdown ends and the debt ceiling gets increased.

House Republicans, however, fear losing their leverage in any talks by giving up those two points without any concessions.

In a new national poll released Monday, most respondents said the government shutdown was causing a crisis or major problems for the country.

While the CNN/ORC International survey also indicated that slightly more people were angry at Republicans than Democrats or Obama for the shutdown, both sides were taking a hit.

According to the poll conducted over the weekend, 63% of respondents said they were angry at the Republicans for the way they have handled the shutdown, while 57% expressed anger at Democrats and 53% at Obama.

""It looks like there is more than enough blame to go around and both parties are being hurt by the shutdown,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.

Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said on CNN's State of the Union that the government risks more than its credit rating if the debt ceiling is not increased by October 17. He dismissed suggestions that the government could avoid default by making only interest payments, saying Social Security payments and veteran's benefits could be endangered.

""It's very dangerous, it's reckless,"" Lew said.

If Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling, borrowing money to meet the nation's obligations won't be possible, CNNMoney's Jeanne Sahadi reported Monday.

Instead, Sahadi reported, lawmakers would have a few options to choose from that would have to be implemented right away -- cut government spending for the military and other discretionary programs by up to 33% every month; cut mandatory spending such as entitlement programs by 16% every month, and raising taxes by up to 12% every month.",www.cnn.com,left,KM5TqPBq8GgC1QGP

Although basic budgetary realities will sink old-age entitlements sometime around 2030 and inflict 25 percent or more cuts in benefits, the Democrats and Republicans writ large have refused to seriously address the iceberg on the horizon.

Many of Donald Trump's supporters evinced an interest in ""burning it down,"" in razing Washington figuratively as the British did during the War of 1812. In his first budget blueprint, their champion has not only failed to do that, he hasn't even really thrown a good first punch. Despite offering significant reductions to parts of the federal budget, he hasn't even submitted a plan that would reduce overall outlays after a decades-long spending spree that has purchased little but debt, deficits, and economic malaise.",www.reason.com,right,2a6JpVADk9Oux9dr

What The Fight Is Over

Shutdown

The government shut down on Monday night because Congress failed to pass a short-term extension of funding, known as a continuing resolution (or CR), by September 30, which would have kept agencies up and running. Typically, in “regular order,” the House and Senate both pass full budgets and then a bipartisan group of lawmakers hash out the differences to create a single budget that then guides specific bills to fund government operations. But after the Senate passed a budget in April, Republicans blocked the move to negotiate over differences 18 times. Since then, they began making a variety of demands, mostly to defund or delay Obamacare, in exchange for keeping the government open.

Debt ceiling

Congress raises the debt ceiling in order to allow the Treasury Department to borrow enough money to meet all of the country’s obligations and pay back the debts it owes. That has happened routinely in the past, including seven times under President George W. Bush. But since 2010, Republicans have been attaching demands to an increase in the debt limit. This brought the U.S. to the brink of default, or the risk of the country being unable to pay its debts, in 2011. That led to the first downgrade of U.S. debt in history and major economic consequences. If the debt ceiling isn’t raised, some have claimed that Treasury can simply “prioritize” payments, or in other words decide which bills to pay first, such as Social Security checks and debt creditors. But many, including Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, multiple Republicans who worked in the Bush administration, the conservative American Enterprise Institute, Goldman Sachs, and the Bipartisan Policy Center, have said that that plan is unworkable. And even if it were workable, it would still mean the country didn’t pay some of its bills, which could have a big impact on how lenders view the government.

Economic Impact

Shutdown

The government shutdown has been estimated to cost $300 million a day at the start, a price tag that will accelerate as it drags on. All told, it could shave about 1.4 percent off of economic output, and If it lasts between three and four weeks, it could cost the economy about $55 billion. Compared to past shutdowns, this is already one of the largest and longest because it isn’t just taking place during weekends and it is impacting virtually every government agency. This racks up costs in a variety of ways: The loss of paychecks for the 800,000 furloughed federal workers will suck about $1 billion a week from the economy. Federal spending will be reduced by about $8 billion, which could reduce GDP by 0.8 percent. Shuttered national parks cost local communities $76 million a day. The government will also lose out on billions in tax revenue. In the end, the shutdown will likely end up increasing the deficit.

Debt ceiling

The U.S. has never actually defaulted on its debt, but while it’s unknown just how bad it would be, all signs indicate that the impact would be catastrophic. The Treasury Department has warned that it could create “a recession more severe than any seen since the Great Depression.” Its report looked at what happened in 2011, when the country barely skirted by default, and found that episode led to a sharp fall in consumer and business confidence, intense turmoil in financial markets that “persisted for months,” and a slowdown in job growth. If the U.S. actually defaulted on debts, investors could become unwilling to lend to the country, something that “forever raises our borrowing costs and lowers our standard of living tomorrow,” as Matthew O’Brien writes at The Atlantic. At the very least, it will result in essentially a 32 percent government spending cut at a time when spending cuts have already been hurting economic growth.

Who Gets Hurt

Shutdown

While the impact of the shutdown hasn’t been felt across the board, there were many people who experienced hardship right away. About 800,000 federal workers were immediately furloughed, sent home without paychecks and legally barred from doing their work, while those deemed to be “essential” workers had to report to work without getting paid either. Basic services in many Native American tribes have been cut off because they rely heavily on federal money. About 2,300 low-income preschoolers weren’t able to go to Head Start because their programs were awaiting grant money on October 1, and thousands more could experience the same impact. Funding for WIC, the nutrition program for low-income mothers and their infants, stopped receiving funding, as did TANF, or welfare, and food stamps job training programs. The impact will ripple out to domestic violence programs, Meals on Wheels, and food pantries that rely on federal donations. The shutdown is impacting other things that will have long-term impacts for everyone, such as health agencies that can’t respond to potential epidemics like the flu or the halting of investment in important scientific research. Even the rich won’t be spared.

federal_budget,Wall Street Journal - News,1,https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-willing-to-hold-off-on-border-wall-funding-1493083058,Trump Willing to Hold Off on Border-Wall Funding,,"Kristina Peterson, Rebecca Ballhaus, Kristina.Peterson Wsj.Com, Rebecca.Ballhaus Wsj.Com","WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump is open to waiting until later this year to secure funding for a wall along the border with Mexico , White House officials said Monday night , in a shift that could clear the way for lawmakers to strike a deal to avoid a government shutdown on Saturday .
Mr. Trump and top administration officials previously indicated the president wanted to include money to begin building a wall along the southern border in the bill to keep the government running after its current funding expires at 12:01 a.m. Saturday , which is also the president ’ s 100th day in office .
The president addressed the issue at a reception with conservative media at the White House on Monday night . The president ’ s new flexibility over whether the wall is funded in this spending bill or one that will be needed in late September could remove one of the last remaining hurdles facing congressional Democrats and Republicans hammering out the five-month bill they must pass this week to avoid a partial government shutdown .

Mr. Trump and top administration officials previously indicated the president wanted to include money to begin building a wall along the southern border in the bill to keep the government running after its current funding expires at 12:01 a.m. Saturday, which is also the president’s 100th day in office.

The president addressed the issue at a reception with conservative media at the White House on Monday night. The president’s new flexibility over whether the wall is funded in this spending bill or one that will be needed in late September could remove one of the last remaining hurdles facing congressional Democrats and Republicans hammering out the five-month bill they must pass this week to avoid a partial government shutdown.

The House GOP debate over a health-care bill, meanwhile, is likely to be pushed to the back burner for now to help avert a shutdown, Republican lawmakers and aides said.

Largely shut out of the budget negotiations, Capitol Hill’s minority parties are getting increasingly antsy about the emerging agreement.

Senate Republicans and House Democrats are learning the details of a possible deal largely through the media. For Republicans, their unease is caused by news that domestic spending may surpass existing caps, fueled by an increase in fees on government services. House Democrats are growing angry over the increased likelihood that federal workers’ benefits are going to be cut and the possible exclusion of unemployment insurance.

“At the Democratic caucus meetings this last week in the House, there was in some senior places some great agita about the process and about the reports of the substance coming out of that process like I haven’t seen in a long time,” Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) said. “It had to do with numbers, reported numbers, it had to do with provisions, it had to do with specific policy positions — a whole laundry list of issues.”

Despite their worries, there may be little that Senate Republicans and House Democrats can do to stop a budget deal being crafted by Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). The House and Senate Budget committee chairmen want to reach a deal before the Dec. 13 deadline, when the House is expected to recess for the year.

In order for a deal to pass, Senate Democrats will need to win over only five Republicans, which aides in both parties predict is a strong possibility.

The fear among Republicans is that there may be another flare of intraparty war if the budget deal trades a spending increase now for savings later, uses fee increases to increase spending rather than for deficit reduction or does not adhere to the $2.1 trillion in savings over 10 years as established by the Budget Control Act.

As angst over the content of the deal grows, the possibility increases that House Democrats or Senate Republicans could mount an attack to stop — or at least slow down — a deal.

But when it comes to questions of urgency , the only issue with overwhelming consensus that it needs to be dealt with this year is the deficit , where 70 percent find it `` essential '' to tackle this year .

ABC 's Z. BYRON WOLF : The news that former Sen. Pete Domenici fathered a child with former Sen. Paul Laxalt 's daughter in the late 1970s was , to say the least , weird . The details of what happened have been blurred by time and the fact that both men are now out of office diminishes its importance as a piece of news today . But it should be noted that opponents of gridlock often complain that comity and deal-making on Capitol Hill have diminished as lawmakers have less frequently moved to the nation 's capital . Their families do n't spend as much time together goes the argument . Who knows if the Domenicis and the Laxalts were friendly before this episode or what happened in their personal drama after .

The video shows Gomez and his family collecting signatures ahead of next week 's deadline at both a shipyard and a diner . The contrast between the two candidates is stark . Gomez is relaxed , comfortable greeting voters in both English and Spanish noting his work as a Navy SEAL , add in his cute kids asking commuters to support their dad and it 's a very well done spot . One thing is clear , despite sharing a few staffers , they want the state to know Gomez is more Scott Brown than Mitt Romney . There 's no pickup truck yet , but maybe his run will feature a boat .

A draft White House immigration plan leaked to the press over the weekend , which frustrated some Republicans working on a bill , since Obama pledged to withhold his plan while lawmakers crafted their own . The White House claimed this week that the leak was unintentional and the president phoned GOP senators to reiterate that he supports the negotiations in Congress . `` It certainly did not jeopardize the entire process .

Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator , said at a White House meeting on Wednesday . `` As an administration , we will be vigilant in addressing threats including corporate and state sponsored trade secret theft that jeopardize our status as the world 's leader for innovation . We will act vigorously to combat theft of U.S. trade secrets that could be used by foreign companies or by foreign governments to gain an unfair economic edge .

The former senator , who called himself a `` recovering politician , '' said that he understands why foreign aid makes an easy political target for members of Congress , whose constituents expect them to focus on domestic policies that benefit the everyday lives of Americans . But Kerry said foreign policy has to rise above partisan politics . `` We need to say no to the politics of the lowest common denominator and simple slogans , and start making real choices that protect the interests of our country , '' said Kerry to applause . `` Unfortunately , the State Department does n't have our own Grover Norquist pushing a pledge to protect it .

The new USA Today-Pew Research Center poll out today shows broad support for the president's approach on the top issues of the day - the deficit, gun control, immigration, and climate change. But when it comes to questions of urgency, the only issue with overwhelming consensus that it needs to be dealt with this year is the deficit, where 70 percent find it ""essential"" to tackle this year. That, of course, is the only one of the four issues being championed by Republican leaders. Read the full poll: http://usat.ly/11WwuPl

ABC's Z. BYRON WOLF: The news that former Sen. Pete Domenici fathered a child with former Sen. Paul Laxalt's daughter in the late 1970s was, to say the least, weird. The details of what happened have been blurred by time and the fact that both men are now out of office diminishes its importance as a piece of news today. But it should be noted that opponents of gridlock often complain that comity and deal-making on Capitol Hill have diminished as lawmakers have less frequently moved to the nation's capital. Their families don't spend as much time together goes the argument. Who knows if the Domenicis and the Laxalts were friendly before this episode or what happened in their personal drama after. But one can only imagine what it was like in the dozen years they served together in the Senate afterward.

ABC's SHUSHANNAH WALSHE: Just one day after we learned Mitt Romney will make his first public appearance since the election when he speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference next month, several of his former staffers who work with Massachusetts U.S. Senate candidate Gabriel Gomez are out with a new video, the first of his new campaign. The video shows Gomez and his family collecting signatures ahead of next week's deadline at both a shipyard and a diner. The contrast between the two candidates is stark. Gomez is relaxed, comfortable greeting voters in both English and Spanish noting his work as a Navy SEAL, add in his cute kids asking commuters to support their dad and it's a very well done spot. One thing is clear, despite sharing a few staffers, they want the state to know Gomez is more Scott Brown than Mitt Romney. There's no pickup truck yet, but maybe his run will feature a boat.

OBAMA: IMMIGRATION LEAK WON'T BLOCK REFORM. President Barack Obama on Wednesday confidently promised that Congress will pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill, saying that a leaked copy of a White House proposal won't jeopardize the effort to overhaul the nation's immigration laws, reports ABC-Univision's Jordan Fabian. A draft White House immigration plan leaked to the press over the weekend, which frustrated some Republicans working on a bill, since Obama pledged to withhold his plan while lawmakers crafted their own. The White House claimed this week that the leak was unintentional and the president phoned GOP senators to reiterate that he supports the negotiations in Congress. ""It certainly did not jeopardize the entire process. The negotiations are still moving forward,"" Obama said during an interview with Univision San Antonio affiliate KWEX. ""Information floats out of Washington all the time; that shouldn't prevent anybody from moving forward."" http://abcn.ws/W4HKGM

WHITE HOUSE UNVEILS STRATEGY TO STEM TRADE SECRET THEFT. The White House announced its strategy to protect against trade secret theft Wednesday, just one day after a report indicated a Chinese military unit may be responsible for a string of cyber attacks on American infrastructure and corporations, reports ABC's Arlette Saenz. ""The theft of trade secrets impacts national security, undermines our global competitiveness, diminishes U.S. exports process and puts American jobs at risk,"" Victoria Espinel, U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator, said at a White House meeting on Wednesday. ""As an administration, we will be vigilant in addressing threats including corporate and state sponsored trade secret theft that jeopardize our status as the world's leader for innovation. We will act vigorously to combat theft of U.S. trade secrets that could be used by foreign companies or by foreign governments to gain an unfair economic edge."" Attorney General Eric Holder echoed the sentiment, saying the U.S. needs to increase cooperation and coordination ""between partners at every level of government [and] improve engagement with the corporations represented in this room today."" He added that ""continuing technological expansion and accelerating globalization"" will only lead to a dramatic ""increase in the threat posed by trade secret theft in the years ahead."" http://abcn.ws/Xm0P5u

SECRETARY KERRY MAKES CASE FOR FOREIGN AID. In his first major foreign policy speech as Secretary of State, John Kerry's message was clear: America cannot afford to treat foreign policy as foreign. He stressed throughout the one hour speech that even in these economically challenging times, foreign aid is an investment in America's national security and economic prosperity, notes ABC's Dana Hughes. The former senator, who called himself a ""recovering politician,"" said that he understands why foreign aid makes an easy political target for members of Congress, whose constituents expect them to focus on domestic policies that benefit the everyday lives of Americans. But Kerry said foreign policy has to rise above partisan politics. ""We need to say no to the politics of the lowest common denominator and simple slogans, and start making real choices that protect the interests of our country,"" said Kerry to applause. ""Unfortunately, the State Department doesn't have our own Grover Norquist pushing a pledge to protect it. We don't have millions of A.A.R.P. seniors who send in their dues and rally to protect America's investments overseas,"" he said. http://abcn.ws/W4l0XB

MITT ROMNEY TO MAKE FIRST POST-ELECTION SPEECH. Former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney will making his first public appearance since losing his presidential bid last November when he speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference in March, reports ABC's Shushannah Walshe. ""I look forward to saying thank you to the many friends and supporters who were instrumental in helping my campaign,"" Romney said in a statement. An advisor to Romney told ABC News the speech is ""an opportunity for him to express his appreciation to supporters and friends."" American Conservative Union Chairman Al Cardenas said ""the thousands gathered at CPAC this year are eager to hear"" from Romney. ""We look forward to hearing Governor Romney's comments on the current state of affairs in America and the world, and his perspective on the future of the conservative movement,"" Cardenas said in a statement. The gathering of conservative activists will be held in mid-March at the Gaylord National hotel in Prince George's County, Maryland. http://abcn.ws/YGV4fx

IN THE NOTE'S INBOX:

-HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER HONORS ROSA PARKS. Less than a week before the unveiling of a statue of Rosa Parks in the U.S. Capitol, House Speaker John Boehner is out with a new video previewing the event. ""Next week, we're going to do something special in the Capitol. We're going to dedicate a statue of civil rights icon Rosa Parks, who changed the world one December evening in 1955 without getting up from her seat,"" Boehner says from the balcony of the chamber where the ceremony will take place next Wednesday. ""All of the statues in this building are important, but none honor an African-American woman … that is, until next week, when Mrs. Parks takes her rightful place alongside the inventors, war heroes, freedom fighters, and doers who represent the heart of the American story. It's another breakthrough for someone who has made so many of them possible. … I hope you'll tune in and watch this historic ceremony live at Speaker.gov, starting at 11 am next Wednesday, the 27th."" WATCH: http://bit.ly/11XdYqc

-ENERGY GROUP BLASTS LIKELY EPA PICK. A GOP strategist passes along this statement from Benjamin Cole of the American Energy Alliance on President Obama's likely pick to head the Environmental Protection Agency: ""For those who were in doubt, the president's decision to replace Lisa Jackson with Gina McCarthy allays all concern. The EPA will continue its anti-fossil fuel crusade undeterred, and the administration will continue to avoid normal democratic means to legislate the president's climate change agenda through the regulatory agencies. The EPA will look as different under Gina McCarthy as Cuba looked when Uncle Fidel passed the hammer and sickle to his little brother Raul.""

The era of austerity may have arrived.

President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans are dug in on the sequester, and there are no signs of a quick fix to the $85 billion in across-the-board spending cuts that both sides say they disdain.

Story Continued Below

That could certainly change after a few bad months of economic numbers or a public outcry. But until average Americans feel the cuts, neither side looks willing to budge on the key issue of revenues without some game-changing factor. And neither party is inclined to risk a government shutdown on sequester politics.

Below are POLITICO’S three possible scenarios for how the next several weeks play out.

Sequester is here to stay

The cuts were designed in 2011 to be so onerous that nobody would want to keep them in place.

But 18 months and several unfulfilling budget battles later, Republicans came to accept sequestration as the only guaranteed way to slice the government’s bottom line. And maybe, just maybe, it won’t be as bad as Obama, Democrats, independent economists and even many Republicans expect.

Boehner penned a Wall Street Journal op-ed last month claiming the sequester “threatens U.S. national security, thousands of jobs and more,” but he backtracked a bit on “Meet the Press,” saying, “I don’t know whether it’s going to hurt the economy or not.”

Congress could take up measures to ease the impact, possibly with legislation giving department heads the ability to better target the cuts.

( Also on POLITICO: What is sequestration?)

If the sequester stays in place through the end of the fiscal year in September, it would mark a new era in Washington: a temporary stall in emergency budget wars, which have dominated Washington since Republicans took over the House in 2011.

The debt limit won’t need to be raised until May at the earliest — that could even stretch until August, according to calculations by some top-level aides.

federal_budget,USA TODAY,1,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/03/18/meal-on-wheels-trump-budget-proposal-cuts/99308928/,Here's the truth about Meals on Wheels in Trump's budget,2017-03-18,,"WASHINGTON — President Trump 's first budget proposal to Congress last week specifically identified steep cuts to hundreds of domestic programs , but Meals on Wheels was n't one of them .
The popular program — which mainly uses volunteer drivers to provide hot meals to older Americans across the country — does n't directly receive federal funding . As Trump 's budget director , Mick Mulvaney , told reporters Thursday , `` Meals on Wheels is not a federal program . ''
Nevertheless , Meals on Wheels quickly became the poster child for the impact of Trump 's budget cuts . Even before the budget 's release , Rep. Keith Ellison , D-Minn. , tweeted that Trump had called for the `` elimination '' of Meals on Wheels , and the Congressional Progressive Caucus quickly dubbed it the `` Starvation Budget . ''

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — President Trump's first budget proposal to Congress last week specifically identified steep cuts to hundreds of domestic programs, but Meals on Wheels wasn't one of them.

The popular program — which mainly uses volunteer drivers to provide hot meals to older Americans across the country — doesn't directly receive federal funding. As Trump's budget director, Mick Mulvaney, told reporters Thursday, ""Meals on Wheels is not a federal program.""

Nevertheless, Meals on Wheels quickly became the poster child for the impact of Trump's budget cuts. Even before the budget's release, Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., tweeted that Trump had called for the ""elimination"" of Meals on Wheels, and the Congressional Progressive Caucus quickly dubbed it the ""Starvation Budget.""

The truth: Trump's budget calls for the elimination of one program that some of the nation's 5,000 Meals on Wheels groups rely on: Community development block grants, a $3 billion program that started in the Ford administration to give states and cities more flexibility in how they combat poverty.

But Trump's proposal — known as the ""skinny budget"" because it's the first, vague outline of a more formal submission to come — is largely silent about the program that provides the vast majority of federal funding for senior services.

""The budget will adversely impact older adults,"" said Sandy Markwood, CEO of the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging. ""We just don’t know how much.""

Here's why. The majority of Meals on Wheels programs get most of their federal funding through the Administration for Community Living, an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services that serves the elderly and disabled. That agency has a $227 million line-item for ""home-delivered nutrition services.""

Those programs are authorized though the Older Americans Act, a law so popular that its renewal passed Congress last year without any recorded opposition. And while Trump didn't single out that specific program, Health and Human Services will receive a 16% across-the-board cut.

""We're very concerned. We’re concerned about the cuts that were explicit in the skinny budget, but we’re also concerned about what we see as the handwriting on the wall with the percentage cuts to HHS,"" Markwood said. ""Some of these details we won't know for a while.""

Meals on Wheels America, a national group that represents 5,000 programs throughout the country, said it was bombarded with questions about the budget and could not respond to press inquiries.

The impact is likely to vary from place to place. Every Meals on Wheels affiliate gets money from a different mix of state, local and federal government funds, along with individual donations and philanthropic organizations.

""We like to say that when you've seen one Meals on Wheels program, you've seen one Meals on Wheels program,"" said Sandra Noe, the executive director of Meals on Wheels of Northwest Indiana. Like many programs, it gets funding from an area agency on aging through the Older Americans Act.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development, which administers the community development block grant program that Trump targeted for elimination, couldn't say how much of that money ultimately flows to Meals on Wheels. It's certainly a small fraction: Social services are capped by law at 15% of the block grants, and the most recent HUD figures show all senior services receive about $33 million.

""We've spent $150 billion on those programs since the 1970s,"" Mulvaney said, referring to the block grants. And since the federal government started to apply more performance measurements to federal programs in the Bush administration those block grants have been ""just not showing any results,"" he said.

""We can't do that anymore. We can't spend money on programs just because they sound good. And great, Meals on Wheels sounds great. Again, that's a state decision to fund that particular portion — to take the federal money and give it to the states, and say look, we want to give you money for programs that don't work.""

But scientific studies have found Meals on Wheels programs are effective in improving nutrition among the elderly. And they're cost effective, because keeping older adults in their homes is less expensive than nursing-home care.

""It's not just a meal, but a wellness check,"" Noe said. ""That volunteer, that driver is able to tune into whether that person's health is failing, or if they’ve fallen or can't get out of their chair. And we’re delivering relief from isolation, and we’re delivering relief to their family as well.""

So, can lawmakers find it?

A break in the two-week impasse began to appear as lawmakers, for the first time since Oct. 1, really started talking to each other, and to the White House. President Obama hosted, separately, members of all four congressional caucuses between Wednesday and Friday.

The meetings resulted in a flurry of compromise plans being floated. It's unclear what version all sides might ultimately decide on, or whether a flare-up could once again scotch the talks.

But the following is an overview of where the middle ground could lie, on each of the major sticking points.

ObamaCare

Democrats' starting position: The White House and Democratic leaders like Reid and Pelosi have insisted that ObamaCare be left entirely intact during budget talks. Obama regards the overhaul as settled law and said he would not negotiate.

Republicans' starting position: In an effort spearheaded by Cruz, Lee and Tea Party allies, Republicans initially demanded that ObamaCare be defunded. The House passed a budget bill doing so, though the Senate rejected that version.

The middle ground: Several ideas have been floated between the two poles on ObamaCare. One was to delay the individual mandate -- the requirement on individuals to buy health insurance -- by a year.

With the insurance exchanges already underway, though, the administration is very resistant to the idea.

One possibility could simply be to delay the sign-up deadline by a few weeks or months.

An amendment opposing the tax won the support of 79 senators; Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, is calling for the repeal again as part of any deal.

This time, though, she's proposing a change in pension policies to offset the lost revenue.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Friday that at least delaying the tax is ""common sense.""

Lawmakers are also talking about imposing more fraud-prevention measures.

The Budget/Sequester

Democrats' starting position: Some Democrats wanted to use the budget process to undo the sequester, across-the-board cuts that took effect in March after lawmakers failed to reach a broader deficit-reduction deal.

Republicans' starting position: House Republicans voted last month to keep the sequester cuts in place.

The middle ground: The first step toward resolving the battle over the sequester may be to provide more flexibility.

Collins and other senators are talking about giving agencies the flexibility to pick and choose what to slash, subject to the oversight of Congress -- as opposed to keeping them locked into across-the-board cuts.

But Fox News has learned that a number of senators, following Friday's meeting at the White House, are now also talking about a plan to potentially swap out some ""discretionary"" spending cuts -- cuts to federal agencies and the like -- for cuts to entitlements.

Entitlements like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security are the biggest drivers of the debt. Part of the reason the sequester was so tough on everything from the Pentagon to the Department of the Interior is because it never touched that side of the equation.

Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., in a Wall Street Journal column, likewise proposed providing ""relief"" to federal agencies from the spending cuts by offsetting some of it with ""structural reforms"" to entitlements.

Debt Ceiling

Democrats' starting position: Obama and other Democrats wanted Congress to approve a no-strings-attached increase in the debt ceiling -- despite having negotiated with Republicans in 2011 over spending cuts.

Republicans' starting position: Republicans started out by planning to attach a host of measures to the debt-ceiling increase -- everything from spending cuts to a delay in ObamaCare to a provision giving the green light to the controversial Keystone pipeline.

The middle ground: Initially, House Speaker John Boehner proffered a short-term increase in the debt ceiling -- one mostly free of additional riders -- as the middle ground in this debate. But Obama pushed back, since he wants to address the partial government shutdown as well.

Not all Republicans were sold on the move, which has been labeled a gimmick by some budget watchdogs.

Sen. John McCain of Arizona said the move amounted to a “Band-Aid,” and that Congress’s refusal to lift the caps is holding back the U.S. military during dangerous times.

Democrats, meanwhile, have said any increase in defense spending should be coupled dollar-for-dollar with increases to domestic spending.

(CNN) - House Speaker John Boehner lashed out at grassroots conservative groups opposed to a compromise budget deal, accusing them on Wednesday of ""using our members and using the American people for their own goals.""

The Speaker said their actions were ""ridiculous"" and noted some of them came out against the bipartisan budget agreement even before it was announced on Tuesday.

The measure struck by Republican House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan and his Senate counterpart, Democrat Patty Murray, aims to avert another shutdown like the one that closed the government for more than two weeks in October.

Many rank-and-file Republicans signaled they could back the deal and predicted it would pass the House on Thursday.

The measure will likely need support from minority Democrats since some Republicans are expected to oppose it.

The White House urged Congress to approve the measure.

Deal aims to avert shutdown

The agreement sets government spending at $1.012 trillion for the current fiscal year that runs through September and $1.014 trillion for next year.

It would eliminate $45 billion from the next round of largely unpopular forced federal spending cuts - known as sequestration - that are set to hit in January and another $18 billion scheduled for 2015.

Overall, it proposes to save $85 billion and would reduce the deficit by more than $20 billion once the money spared from sequestration is factored in, budget leaders said.

Boehner's comments to reporters were aimed at some of the same organizations that have effectively pressured House Republicans previously to not compromise on budget issues.

They include Americans for Prosperity, Club for Growth, Freedom Works, Heritage Action and the Koch brothers, GOP campaign financiers.

Boehner made similar comments questioning the motives of some of the groups at a closed-door meeting with all House Republicans to discuss the agreement.

Diminished impact apparent

The Speaker told members that ""no one controls your voting card but you,"" according to a GOP source in the meeting.

But with this deal, their impact appears to be diminished with signs of growing Republican support.

I'm not sure that the outside groups are going to be able to influence us,"" said Rep. John Fleming, a conservative from Louisiana.

Fleming said conservative groups won't be able to sway as many conservatives because so many like the idea of the deal returning Congress to what's known as regular order - deliberating and passing bills the way they're supposed to be done, instead of backroom deals amid crisis.

But Idaho GOP Rep Raul Labrador, a critic of the plan, responded to Boehner's comments.

""What is it that groups said yesterday that is false today?"" he asked.

Labrador touted his approval rating with Heritage Action at a Capitol Hill forum sponsored by the advocacy group that is growing in influence. He said anyone who suggests his vote is for sale ""is sadly mistaken""

Conservative criticism

Dan Holler, a spokesman for Heritage Action, didn't back down from his criticism of the budget deal.

""Over the next few days, lawmakers will have to explain to their constituents, many of whom are our members, what they've achieved by increasing spending, increasing taxes and offering up another round of promises waiting to be broken. That will be a really tough sell back home,"" Holler said in a statement to CNN.

Ryan, the chief negotiator of the deal, gave what even opponents called a stellar closed-door presentation to fellow Republicans.

Top House Republican leaders also told their members they recognized some were disappointed with the proposal. But it met their test to continue reducing the deficit and was a good deal given the political limitations on Capitol Hill.

""It's the best compromise you can get in divided government,"" said Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican, agreeing with Ryan's argument for supporting the deal.

Fleming, who tends to vote against any compromise of conservative principles on economic issues, said Ryan gave a convincing argument that, long term, this bipartisan deal begins to address excess spending Republicans rail against.

Rep. Matt Salmon, an Arizona Republican, told reporters he plans to vote ""no"" because he is disappointed this doesn't do more to address the biggest contributors to the debt and deficit, like Medicare and Medicaid.

""It's an incredibly small baby step,"" said Salmon, conceding that the measure would ultimately pass.

Sequester cuts, security fee

Other Republicans will oppose it for other reasons, like the decision to ease the sequester or the proposal to increase the fee paid by airline passengers to help cover federal aviation security costs. Some see that as a tax hike.

Because of that GOP opposition, Democrats will have to join Republicans in order for the budget deal to pass.

Although Democrats have different problems with the budget agreement, several came out of their Wednesday meeting saying they, too, expect the proposal to pass before the House leaves town for the holidays this week.

""I'll hold my nose and vote 'yes,'"" said Rep Gerry Connolly, a Virginia Democrat.

He has federal workers in his suburban Washington-area district who would have to contribute more to their federal pensions as a result of the deal.

In 2010, that reality was outlawed, and now the question is whether the ban was a help or a hindrance to the political system.

The Rise Of The Earmark

There was a lot of backroom dealing when Sen. Alan Simpson was in Congress.

""There isn't a single person in Congress — not one, not me, not anybody — that didn't ... want to hook [a project] to a moving train,"" Simpson says. ""So they'd wait for a bill they knew would pass, couldn't possibly not pass, and they'd just hook it on.""

'A Small Price To Pay'

In 2010, several senators, including Mark Udall, D-Colo., introduced a bipartisan bill to end earmarks. Udall tells Lyden that he had become convinced that earmarks were unfairly apportioned.

""The more senior and the more committees on which you sat, the more earmarks you were able to generate, and that just seemed to me to be fundamentally unfair,"" Udall says.

According to The Associated Press, ""the GOP-led House is slated to pass the 1,582-page bill Wednesday, though many Tea Party conservatives are sure to oppose it."" A Senate vote is expected by week's end and that Democratic-led chamber is also expected to pass the plan.

NPR's Ailsa Chang tells our Newscast Desk that the bill ""fleshes out the broad outlines provided in last month's budget agreement on Capitol Hill.""

The budget, she says, authorizes spending ""for nearly every speck of government within the guidelines of last month's budget agreement. One notable difference between this bill and the December deal involves cuts to military pensions. The budget agreement announced last month reduced the annual cost-of-living increases for military retirees under 62 by one percent. This spending plan reverses that cut, but only for disabled veterans and relatives of deceased members of the military.""

Reuters adds that:

""The measure eases across-the-board spending cuts by providing an extra $45 billion for military and domestic discretionary programs for fiscal 2014, to a total of $1.012 trillion. It also provides an additional $85.2 billion for Afghanistan war funding that is typically handled off-budget.""

Bloomberg News notes that ""funding runs through Jan. 15 [Wednesday], so lawmakers also plan to pass a separate three-day stopgap bill at current funding levels to push the deadline to Jan. 18. That would give lawmakers enough time to enact the comprehensive legislation without risking a government shutdown. The House plans to vote on the three-day measure today.""

As for the politics of all this, The Hill says that:",www.npr.org,center,2lHTDqK3FGr0QI24

During the housing bust, taxpayers were forced to bail out mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. But thanks to the real estate recovery, Fannie Mae could end up paying tens of billions of dollars back to the Treasury this summer.

That's just one of the factors behind a better bottom line for the federal government. This week, the Treasury Department announced it will pay down some of its debt for the first time in six years.

Washington has been so preoccupied with warnings of exploding deficits in recent years that John Makin of the conservative American Enterprise Institute was caught off guard when he checked out the numbers.

""I'm surprised that more people who talk a lot about it haven't looked carefully at where we find ourselves,"" he says.

Looking to head off deep, automatic spending cuts set to kick in on March 1, President Obama on Tuesday afternoon said that to avoid the negative economic effects that come with ""political disfunction,"" Congress should move quickly to pass ""a smaller package of spending cuts and tax reforms"" that won't hurt the economy.

Acknowledging that Congress likely won't be able to pass a ""full budget"" by March 1 and avoid the so-called sequester that would bring sharp reductions in spending on defense and other programs, Obama pushed for a temporary plan that would give lawmakers another few months to negotiate on a larger deficit reduction package.

The president also used an early afternoon appearance in the White House briefing room to push for a long-term deal that includes a ""balanced mix of spending cuts and more tax reform.""

Before the president's statement, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, released a statement saying that ""Americans do not support replacing real spending cuts with more tax increases.""

Our original post and an earlier update:

President Obama will ""call on Congress to act to avoid the sequester and reduce the deficit in a balanced way."" the White House says.

Officials tell the White House press corps that the president ""will call on Congress to pass a smaller package of spending cuts and tax reforms to avoid the economically harmful consequences of the sequester for a few months."" He's scheduled to issue that call around 1:15 p.m. ET.

As NPR's Ari Shapiro reports for our Newscast Desk:

""Congress created the sequester as a forcing mechanism. Across-the-board cuts would only take effect if lawmakers failed to agree on a deficit reduction plan. These cuts were designed to be so draconian that Congress would have no choice but to cut the deficit. ""That's not how it worked out. ""Congress failed to reach an agreement, and now the sequester is looming. The White House believes it's already hurting economic growth. ""So today, President Obama will call on Congress to pass a small package of spending cuts and tax changes. ""A White House official says this is intended to give more time to reach a solution that permanently avoids the sequester and significantly reduces the deficit.""

We'll watch for more news from the president's statement.

Update at 1:05 p. m. ET. New Deficit Numbers And A Warning From The CBO:

There's a good chance the president will talk about this — the Congressional Budget Office just reported that:

Tuesday ’ s cloture vote on the short-term budget compromise in the Senate rests squarely on the 14 Republicans on the Appropriations Committee .
Six are up for reelection in 2014 and may find some reason to back out . But that leaves more than enough to help Democrats get to 60 votes , given the political cover already provided by fellow Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee .
All but two of the 29 Republicans on the House panel voted for the deal last Thursday , including members from seven states represented by GOP senators on Senate Appropriations . And after the three-to-one victory in the House , the Appropriations leadership has been so invested in a positive Senate result that even speculation of defeat shows how much Congress ’ s self-confidence has eroded .
Indeed , inside the Senate committee , Tuesday ’ s cloture vote may be less about the budget deal than internal Republican politics over who gets chairmanships if the GOP were to regain the Senate in the 2014 elections .
The recent decision by Sen. Thad Cochran ( R-Miss . ) to seek reelection means he could yet lay claim to the chairmanship of Appropriations at the expense of Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby , the current ranking Republican .
A Shelby spokesman said Sunday that “ it is baseless ” to suggest the potential competition with Cochran has anything to do with Shelby ’ s opposition to the budget deal . But after months of saying that he wants a top-line number from which to write 2014 bills , Shelby ’ s office said Sunday that he will vote against cloture Tuesday .
The upside-down politics from the committee standpoint is akin to the famous line from the war in Vietnam : The U.S. had to “ destroy the town to save it. ” By opposing cloture , Shelby may help himself become chairman , perhaps . But if he kills the deal , what will be left of the committee when he gets the gavel ?
For many on Appropriations , Tuesday ’ s vote is almost just that existential .
The budget agreement would negate sequestration in January and reset the Budget Control Act with more manageable caps on discretionary spending for fiscal 2014 and 2015 . This is pivotal for the committees if they are ever to be a force again in this Congress . And only with the deal can the Appropriations leadership salvage the work it ’ s already done on the dozen fiscal 2014 spending bills .
In the wake of the House vote , meetings are already under way to package the 12 together in a single omnibus package in January . But if the budget deal were to collapse , Appropriations would be pushed aside again , leaving the government under a long-term continuing resolution for the third time in four years .
“ I think we ’ ll get the votes , ” Sen. Susan Collins ( R-Maine ) told ███ . But she admits some bafflement as to why this is a close call for her fellow Republicans on Appropriations .
“ I would think appropriators would welcome the chance to have a top-line and write our bills , ” Collins said . “ We Republicans have said for years that we want to get back to normal order and a budget . Now we have a bipartisan agreement negotiated by a conservative House budget chairman . Why is this close ? ”
The contrast with House Republicans could not be more stark .
House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers ( R-Ky. ) worked last Thursday ’ s floor vote hard inside his committee , losing just Reps. Jack Kingston of George and Andy Harris of Maryland . Equally important , Republicans on House Appropriations from seven states — also represented by Republicans on the Senate committee — voted for the deal .
Those states were Alabama , Arkansas , Kansas , Kentucky , Nebraska , Mississippi and Tennessee — represented in the Senate , respectively , by Shelby , John Boozman , Jerry Moran , Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , Mike Johanns , Cochran and Lamar Alexander .
McConnell , Cochran and Alexander all face primary challenges at home in which elements of the tea party are agitating to oust them . But Shelby is not up for reelection and has enjoyed a longtime working friendship with Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski ( D-Md . ) .
“ We ’ ve got a history . We would both like a [ top-line ] number being appropriators , ” Shelby told ███ in early November . “ Barbara and I need a number to be relevant again . ”
Part of Shelby ’ s opposition now could be a courtesy to his fellow Alabaman , Jeff Sessions — the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee and candidate in 2014 — who is fiercely against the budget plan .
But the chairmanship side of the equation can ’ t be ignored . Shelby has firmly installed himself as the ranking Republican — having succeeded Cochran at the beginning of this year . But if the GOP were to win back the Senate in 2014 , Cochran would have the right under Senate GOP rules to come back as Appropriations chairman .
This would set up a potential party fight between the two powerful Southerners if Shelby wanted to stay on . Cochran ’ s more moderate record could leave him exposed within the GOP conference . And Shelby has been careful to never stray far from McConnell , who undercut Cochran badly when the Mississippian was the ranking Republican on the committee .
“ Yes , he wants a discretionary number so that the Appropriations Committee can do its work , ” a Shelby spokesman said . “ But taken in totality , this is an overall budget deal that he does not support . ”","Tuesday’s cloture vote may be less about the budget deal than internal GOP politics.

Tuesday’s cloture vote on the short-term budget compromise in the Senate rests squarely on the 14 Republicans on the Appropriations Committee.

Six are up for reelection in 2014 and may find some reason to back out. But that leaves more than enough to help Democrats get to 60 votes, given the political cover already provided by fellow Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee.

Story Continued Below

All but two of the 29 Republicans on the House panel voted for the deal last Thursday, including members from seven states represented by GOP senators on Senate Appropriations. And after the three-to-one victory in the House, the Appropriations leadership has been so invested in a positive Senate result that even speculation of defeat shows how much Congress’s self-confidence has eroded.

Indeed, inside the Senate committee, Tuesday’s cloture vote may be less about the budget deal than internal Republican politics over who gets chairmanships if the GOP were to regain the Senate in the 2014 elections.

The recent decision by Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) to seek reelection means he could yet lay claim to the chairmanship of Appropriations at the expense of Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby, the current ranking Republican.

A Shelby spokesman said Sunday that “it is baseless” to suggest the potential competition with Cochran has anything to do with Shelby’s opposition to the budget deal. But after months of saying that he wants a top-line number from which to write 2014 bills, Shelby’s office said Sunday that he will vote against cloture Tuesday.

The upside-down politics from the committee standpoint is akin to the famous line from the war in Vietnam: The U.S. had to “destroy the town to save it.” By opposing cloture, Shelby may help himself become chairman, perhaps. But if he kills the deal, what will be left of the committee when he gets the gavel?

For many on Appropriations, Tuesday’s vote is almost just that existential.

The budget agreement would negate sequestration in January and reset the Budget Control Act with more manageable caps on discretionary spending for fiscal 2014 and 2015. This is pivotal for the committees if they are ever to be a force again in this Congress. And only with the deal can the Appropriations leadership salvage the work it’s already done on the dozen fiscal 2014 spending bills.

In the wake of the House vote, meetings are already under way to package the 12 together in a single omnibus package in January. But if the budget deal were to collapse, Appropriations would be pushed aside again, leaving the government under a long-term continuing resolution for the third time in four years.

“I think we’ll get the votes,” Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) told POLITICO. But she admits some bafflement as to why this is a close call for her fellow Republicans on Appropriations.

“I would think appropriators would welcome the chance to have a top-line and write our bills,” Collins said. “We Republicans have said for years that we want to get back to normal order and a budget. Now we have a bipartisan agreement negotiated by a conservative House budget chairman. Why is this close?”

The contrast with House Republicans could not be more stark.

House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers (R-Ky.) worked last Thursday’s floor vote hard inside his committee, losing just Reps. Jack Kingston of George and Andy Harris of Maryland. Equally important, Republicans on House Appropriations from seven states — also represented by Republicans on the Senate committee — voted for the deal.

Those states were Alabama, Arkansas, Kansas, Kentucky, Nebraska, Mississippi and Tennessee — represented in the Senate, respectively, by Shelby, John Boozman, Jerry Moran, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Mike Johanns, Cochran and Lamar Alexander.

McConnell, Cochran and Alexander all face primary challenges at home in which elements of the tea party are agitating to oust them. But Shelby is not up for reelection and has enjoyed a longtime working friendship with Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.).

“We’ve got a history. We would both like a [top-line] number being appropriators,” Shelby told POLITICO in early November. “Barbara and I need a number to be relevant again.”

Part of Shelby’s opposition now could be a courtesy to his fellow Alabaman, Jeff Sessions — the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee and candidate in 2014 — who is fiercely against the budget plan.

But the chairmanship side of the equation can’t be ignored. Shelby has firmly installed himself as the ranking Republican — having succeeded Cochran at the beginning of this year. But if the GOP were to win back the Senate in 2014, Cochran would have the right under Senate GOP rules to come back as Appropriations chairman.

This would set up a potential party fight between the two powerful Southerners if Shelby wanted to stay on. Cochran’s more moderate record could leave him exposed within the GOP conference. And Shelby has been careful to never stray far from McConnell, who undercut Cochran badly when the Mississippian was the ranking Republican on the committee.

“Yes, he wants a discretionary number so that the Appropriations Committee can do its work,” a Shelby spokesman said. “But taken in totality, this is an overall budget deal that he does not support.”",www.politico.com,left,vZAAh0JB82CUDr8i

McCormick: What we need is action to end shutdown, not political posturing

Every day, the federal government's partial shutdown brings more tragic and disheartening news to America's veterans, troops and their families.

This week, the Department of Defense announced it would be unable to pay the $100,000 death gratuity benefit to support families of the fallen -- news that is insulting to those who serve and their families.

For a government that readily claims to support America's troops and veterans by spending billions on service members and veterans, legislators failed to notice that this particular lack of funding, a mere fraction of the Defense Department's budget, would be cut off, causing needless pain to grieving families.

The news drew quick condemnation from pundits, the military and veterans community, and members of Congress. Politicians from both parties, displaying a sense of urgency yet to be seen on the notion of ending the shutdown, rushed to condemn the decision and quickly called for the benefits to be reinstated.

Common budget tool to fund the government, the ""continuing resolution,"" is becoming more divisive

Some Republicans are trying to tie government spending to defunding Obamacare

Experts say continuing resolutions are inefficient

In less than a month, the government may shut down. Lines are being drawn. Vacations are being canceled. Friends are becoming enemies.

Are you concerned yet? Confused? Well, if you're not, you should be.

At the center of complex negotiations in Washington is a sturdy little political device known as a continuing resolution, also called a ""CR.""

A continuing resolution? A CR? What in the heck is that? Good question. It is a legislative tool designed to keep the government running when the president and Congress can't get it together.

By October 1 -- the deadline to keep funding everything in the government from the IRS to the Army -- you'll probably hear the term hundreds of times in news articles and out of the mouths of commentators and pundits. So let's explain:

Q: What is a 'CR'?

A: It's a legislative trick to pay the bills. The federal government's fiscal year starts October 1. And the one key duty laid out in the Constitution for Congress is to pass spending bills that fund the government.

Want a few billion for roads and bridges? Go see Congress. That aircraft carrier needs a new paint job? Congress is the place to go.

Sounds simple enough, but, in reality, the House and the Senate haven't done their job.

In the past year, Congress hasn't passed any of the 12 different spending bills that fund the much of the government, including defense programs, transportation projects and education.

So when Congress doesn't do its job, then it has to pass a continuing resolution, also referred to as a short-term spending bill or a stop-gap spending measure.

It is a bill that sidesteps the lengthy budget process and funds the government for a specified period of time. It can last anywhere from a day to a year.

CRs are not an anomaly. They have been used 156 times between 1977 and 2011.

And before 1977, they were so common that Congress changed the start of the fiscal year from July to October to give lawmakers more time to pass the spending bills. That worked for a few years but then Congress settled into the new schedule and, like any high school student -- or journalist on deadline -- it procrastinated. So it had to revert back to the use of CRs to keep the government open.

And here we are.

Q: Why shut down the government?

A: Yea, why? And what does CR have to do with a government shutdown?

Often, a CR is a simple legislative extension to accommodate lawmakers who don't get their work done. It's not designed to solve a debate embroiled in partisan politics.

""Typically these appropriations bills are not that partisan,"" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense.

But that's not always the case.

Congress ""recognizes one of their leverages is the power of the purse,"" Ellis said, adding that politicization of the budget process has become more polarized during the Obama administration.

House Speaker John Boehner has proposed a short-term spending bill that would fund the government until December 15. But then politics got in the way.

This year, a core group of conservative Republicans in the House wants to tie the entire $986 billion annual operating budget to a provision to defund the health care law known as Obamacare.

It's worth it, they say, to rein in the first two years of the Obama administration's spending spree, which included $830 billion in economic stimulus and an expensive new health care law.

Q: Have we been here before?

A. Yes. In 1995 and 1996, President Bill Clinton battled a Republican-led Congress over spending levels (his nemesis was then-Speaker Newt Gingrich).

It ended in a government shutdown -- for 28 days at the end of 1995 and beginning of 1996 -- and the American public largely blamed Congress.

Following the shutdown, Clinton gained an enormous political upper hand and Gingrich later lost his job as speaker.

While politics seem particularly bad during these times, it's important to remember that the government hasn't actually shut down under this Congress or this president. Yet.

Q: So why is this so hard?

A. Passing spending bills is not easy. They can reflect the fundamental differences of governing philosophy. Should we fund school lunches or more tanks? Aid to Egypt or money for Detroit?

It often takes intense negotiating between the two chambers of Congress and the president. But some in Congress complain that President Barack Obama has not been the easiest guy to work with, especially when it comes to bridging partisan gaps.

He rarely interacts with members of Congress, many say they don't trust him and he has angered once-friends on the Hill with his recent positions on Syria.

Q: Can it get any worse?

But even as it warns of the dire consequences of a lapse in full funding for the US military , a new study by a panel that includes four former flag officers on the Joint Chiefs of Staff concludes that that the Pentagon could cut 50,000 civilian employees – as well as 60,000 US troops – without damaging US national security .
“ The Defense Department is not a jobs program , ” Barry Blechman , an author of the report by the Stimson Center , a nonpartisan global security think tank , said at a press conference Tuesday releasing the report .
He added that lawmakers have “ stood in the way ” of cuts for fear of alienating big defense contractors who contribute to campaigns and create jobs in key districts .
Top Pentagon officials are telegraphing their own warnings to lawmakers , arguing that if Congress does not pass a budget or pass a continuing resolution by the end of the month , some portions of the Department of Defense will be forced to close .
That said , “ the department remains hopeful that a government shutdown will be averted , ” Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter wrote in a memo released this week .
“ Prudent management , ” however , “ requires that we be prepared for all contingencies . ”
These contingencies would not impact US troops , who would continue with their normal duties .
At the same time , “ a large number of our civilian employees would be temporarily furloughed , ” Carter said .
Such a scenario is not a tragedy for the authors of the Stimson Center report , which strikes a slightly resigned tone in the face of looming DOD cuts .
That group noted that in a previous report it released last year it had “ laid out a new defense strategy for the United States ... and considered how to implement it at various budgetary levels . We believed that strategy would protect US interests even at much lower levels of spending . ”
The problem , the report ’ s authors said at the press conference Tuesday , is that “ we assumed that our political leaders would make any necessary cuts in defense rationally , to ensure the protection of relevant capabilities and make the department more efficient . We were united in our faith that they would not let the indiscriminate cuts caused by sequester to occur . ”
The sequester – mandatory , across-the-board spending cuts – went into effect in 2013 , and “ with no fiscal deal in sight it could occur again in fiscal year 2014 and subsequent years . ”
And so the new Stimson Center report offers – as an alternative to what former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and others have referred to as the “ meat axe ” sequester approach – more targeted , “ prudent ” cuts that would save $ 50 billion in fiscal year 2013 .
This includes saving $ 22 billion by cutting “ excess military and civilian personnel in headquarters and defense agencies , cutting back on centralized training . ”
A key piece of this is also reforming military retirement and health benefits – a large and growing DOD expense – “ in a way that honors our sacred obligation to those who serve . ”
The Stimson Center study group , which includes a handful of retired generals and admirals who have held some of the top posts in their services , also suggests saving another $ 20 billion by “ cutting active forces best suited for protracted wars and some nuclear forces . ”
Instead , they call for “ re-emphasizing the cost-effective strategic depth provided by the Guard and Reserve , and expanding investment in cyber-capabilities . ”
Pentagon officials say they are already planning to shrink the Army from a war-time high of 570,000 to 490,000 by 2017 . The Stimson center report says the DOD could go further , decreasing the ranks of soldiers to 450,000 .
It also suggests reducing the size of the Marine Corps to 160,000 ( Pentagon officials would prefer to keep the size of the Corps closer to 182,000 . )

“ We acknowledge that these recommendations carry a degree of strategic risk , ” the Stimson Center authors note . “ Realistically , however , significant belt-tightening means doing without some forces we would have preferred to maintain . ”

Their conclusion? “We were wrong.”

The sequester – mandatory, across-the-board spending cuts – went into effect in 2013, and “with no fiscal deal in sight it could occur again in fiscal year 2014 and subsequent years.”

And so the new Stimson Center report offers – as an alternative to what former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and others have referred to as the “meat axe” sequester approach – more targeted, “prudent” cuts that would save $50 billion in fiscal year 2013.

This includes saving $22 billion by cutting “excess military and civilian personnel in headquarters and defense agencies, cutting back on centralized training.”

A key piece of this is also reforming military retirement and health benefits – a large and growing DOD expense – “in a way that honors our sacred obligation to those who serve.”

The Stimson Center study group, which includes a handful of retired generals and admirals who have held some of the top posts in their services, also suggests saving another $20 billion by “cutting active forces best suited for protracted wars and some nuclear forces.”

Instead, they call for “re-emphasizing the cost-effective strategic depth provided by the Guard and Reserve, and expanding investment in cyber-capabilities.”

Pentagon officials say they are already planning to shrink the Army from a war-time high of 570,000 to 490,000 by 2017. The Stimson center report says the DOD could go further, decreasing the ranks of soldiers to 450,000.

It also suggests reducing the size of the Marine Corps to 160,000 (Pentagon officials would prefer to keep the size of the Corps closer to 182,000.)

“We acknowledge that these recommendations carry a degree of strategic risk,” the Stimson Center authors note. “Realistically, however, significant belt-tightening means doing without some forces we would have preferred to maintain.”

“However, we must stop ignoring fiscal realities,” they add. “The consequences of continuing along the current path are far too dangerous.”",www.csmonitor.com,center,3LSe0MFLVxna96jO

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — The Federal Reserve is unleashing its boldest effort yet to protect the U.S. economy from the coronavirus by helping companies and governments pay their bills and survive a devastating crisis .
With lending in Treasury and mortgage markets threatening to shut down , the Fed announced an aggressive set of programs Monday to try to smooth out those markets . To do so , it committed to buy as much government-backed debt as it deems necessary . And for the first time ever , the Fed said it plans to buy corporate debt , too .
Its intervention is intended to ensure that households , companies , banks and governments can get the loans they need at a time when their own revenue is fast drying up as the economy stalls .
The Fed ’ s all-out effort to support the flow of credit through an economy ravaged by the viral outbreak has now gone beyond even the extraordinary drive it made to rescue the economy from the 2008 financial crisis .
“ The coronavirus pandemic is causing tremendous hardship across the United States and around the world , ” the Fed said in a statement . “ Aggressive efforts must be taken across the public and private sectors to limit the losses to jobs and incomes and to promote a swift recovery once the disruptions abate . ”
The announcement initially lifted stocks in early trading . But rancorous talks in Congress over a $ 2 trillion rescue package — and uncertainty over when any agreement might be reached — depressed shares about 2.5 % in volatile midday trading . The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond fell , a sign that more investors are willing to purchase the securities .
With its new programs , the Fed , led by Chair Jerome Powell , is trying to both stabilize the economy and allay panic in financial markets . As the need for cash has escalated among many corporations and city and state governments , large businesses have been drawing as much as they can on their existing borrowing relationships with banks .
The intensifying need for money means that banks and other investors are seeking to rapidly unload Treasuries , short-term corporate debt , municipal bonds and other securities . The Fed ’ s move to intervene as a buyer of last resort is intended to supply that needed cash .
President Donald Trump , a frequent Fed critic , had rare praise for Powell on Monday .
“ I really think he ’ s caught up and he ’ s done the right thing , ” Trump said during a White House press conference . He said he called Powell on Monday and said , “ Jerome , good job. ” Less than two weeks ago , Trump was noting that he had the power to fire or demote the Fed chief .
The central bank ’ s actions , meanwhile , increase pressure on Congress to approve an agreement that would include funds to backstop the Fed ’ s lending . Many economists say that whatever financial support Congress eventually provides will likely be even more important than the Fed ’ s intervention . And they warn that such fiscal help needs to come soon .
The Fed ’ s intervention is not a substitute for fiscal stimulus , ” said Joseph Gagnon , a former Fed economist who is now senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics . “ Let ’ s hope Congress passes something quickly . ”
Joe Brusuelas , chief economist at RSM , a tax and advisory firm , said that if Congress can pass the legislation and have it signed into law by Tuesday , banks could start making loans to small and medium-sized businesses , with the Fed ’ s support , by Friday .
In its announcement Monday , the Fed said it will establish three new lending facilities that will provide up to $ 300 billion by purchasing corporate bonds , a wider range of municipal bonds and securities tied to such debt as auto and real estate loans . It will also buy an unlimited amount of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities to try to hold down borrowing rates and ensure those markets function smoothly .
The central bank ’ s go-for-broke approach is an acknowledgment that its previous plans to keep credit flowing smoothly , which included dollar limits , wouldn ’ t be enough in the face of the viral outbreak , which has brought the U.S. economy to a near-standstill as workers and consumers stay home . Last week , it said it would buy $ 500 billion of Treasuries and $ 200 billion of mortgage-backed securities , then quickly ran through roughly half those amounts by week ’ s end .
And on Monday , the New York Federal Reserve said it would buy $ 75 billion of Treasuries and $ 50 billion of mortgage-backed securities each day this week .
“ They ’ re really setting the economy up ” to start functioning again when the health crisis subsides , said Donald Kohn , a former Fed vice chair who is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution . “ Part of this is about the other side of the valley : Make sure the credit is there . ’ ’
Kohn noted that it would take time to set up some of the Fed ’ s programs , but just knowing that they are on the way should reassure businesses .
Many companies seeking loans are worried about cash flow as their revenue dries up along with their customers . Elizabeth Cooper McFadden , who runs Novella Brandhouse , a marketing firm in Kansas City , Missouri , has applied for a disaster loan from the Small Business Administration . But she ’ s concerned about how long that loan will take to be processed and wonders if the Fed program might be faster . She will need more money in the next 30 to 60 days .
McFadden would also like to see more lenient terms than SBA loans allow .
“ We ’ re looking at any and all options , ” she said , adding , hopefully : “ I feel that 90 days from now , it ’ s going to be a different picture — in a positive way . ”
The Fed mostly creates the money it will use to buy bonds and lend to large and small businesses . But it seeks to avoid credit losses . It has been using money from a Treasury fund to offset any losses on its loans . That fund has already committed most of that money to the Fed ’ s existing facilities . The congressional legislation could boost that amount by about $ 500 billion .
“ The steps announced today , combined with the previous ones ... should substantially improve market functioning and should provide some important support for the economy , ” said Roberto Perli , a former Fed economist who is now head of global policy research at Cornerstone Macro .
But Perli cautioned that the benefits won ’ t be felt immediately .
“ The next couple of quarters will still be probably bad , ” he said .
The new programs announced Monday by the Fed include two that will buy corporate debt issued by large companies .
One program will buy newly issued corporate debt . This is an effort to revive that market , which has effectively come to a standstill . The second will buy previously issued corporate debt . Both programs will include $ 10 billion provided by the Treasury to offset any losses .
A third new lending program will buy securities backed by packages of auto loans , credit card loans and some small business loans . Lending in those areas hinges on the ability of banks to package those loans into securities and sell them . So the Fed ’ s move is critical to the ability of banks to continue to provide these loans as the economy falters .
The Treasury will also provide $ 10 billion to that program to offset any losses . All told , those three programs can lend up to $ 300 billion .
The Fed said that companies “ that are expected to receive direct financial assistance under pending federal legislation ” are not eligible to participate in the corporate lending programs — a reference to the airline industry and perhaps others under consideration .
Companies will have to be rated at investment grade , or above junk level , to be eligible for lending . The companies can defer payments for up to six months , the Fed said . If they do suspend payment , they are not allowed to buy back their shares or pay dividends , it said .

The central bank’s go-for-broke approach is an acknowledgment that its previous plans to keep credit flowing smoothly, which included dollar limits, wouldn’t be enough in the face of the viral outbreak, which has brought the U.S. economy to a near-standstill as workers and consumers stay home.

The Fed mostly creates the money it will use to buy bonds and lend to large and small businesses. But it seeks to avoid credit losses. It has been using money from a Treasury fund to offset any losses on its loans. That fund has already committed most of that money to the Fed’s existing facilities. The congressional legislation could boost that amount by about $500 billion.

The new programs announced Monday by the Fed include two that will buy corporate debt issued by large companies.

One program will buy newly issued corporate debt. This is an effort to revive that market, which has effectively come to a standstill. The second will buy previously issued corporate debt. Both programs will include $10 billion provided by the Treasury to offset any losses.

A third new lending program will buy securities backed by packages of auto loans, credit card loans and some small business loans.

The Treasury will also provide $10 billion to that program to offset any losses. All told, those three programs can lend up to $300 billion.

The Fed said that companies “that are expected to receive direct financial assistance under pending federal legislation” are not eligible to participate in the corporate lending programs — a reference to the airline industry and perhaps others under consideration.

Companies will have to be rated at investment grade, or above junk level, to be eligible for lending. The companies can defer payments for up to six months, the Fed said. If they do suspend payment, they are not allowed to buy back their shares or pay dividends, it said.

That program will likely be funded by and is intended to complement the congressional stimulus legislation, which also includes a provision to provide financing to very small companies. The Fed’s Main Street program will target medium-sized businesses, officials said.

Brusuelas noted that by announcing the Main Street lending program, the Fed had committed to something before a congressional backstop was in place, a virtually unheard-of step.

“You’re never going to see that again, hopefully,” he said.

Now that the sequester has taken effect , there 's a new phrase that keeps popping up in Washington : the `` continuing resolution . '' If Congress does n't pass a continuing resolution by March 27 , the government will run out of money and will likely shut down . Here 's a list of four things you might want to know about how a continuing resolution works and how it might soften the blow of the sequester .
The continuing resolution , or CR for short , is legislation that basically allows Congress to just carry over the previous fiscal year 's budget into the next one . In other words , it permits Congress to maintain roughly the same budget priorities and budget levels over the subsequent year . A CR can last for any length of time , whatever Congress wants — a few weeks , six months , a year , anything .
2 . Why would Congress want to pass a CR in the first place ?
Let 's back up a little bit . Every year , Congress has to set funding levels for agencies and departments . According to the Constitution , Congress is supposed to do this through appropriations bills . But when Congress ca n't agree on what those appropriations should look like , they punt , by passing a continuing resolution . Or , they can pass individual appropriations bills for some departments and use a CR for the rest of the departments if they ca n't hammer out those particular budgets . Often Congress just passes a CR to buy itself more time .
And if lawmakers ca n't even pass a CR before government funding runs out , the government could simply shut down .
3 . Is there a real threat of a government shutdown in this case ?
Both House Speaker John Boehner and President Obama seem to agree — they 're not interested in that particular game of chicken . The last time the government shut down was in 1995 and 1996 , during the Clinton presidency . Republicans paid a political price for that .
Actually , lawmakers in Washington are used to passing continuing resolutions . Over the past 40 years , the CR has been the standard way of doing business on Capitol Hill . Going through the full , traditional appropriations process is a now very rare event in Washington .
4 . So how does the continuing resolution interact with the sequester ?
Oh , right , there 's the sequester . Because a sequester is in effect , figuring out what a budget will look like under a continuing resolution is going to be messier .

Now that the sequester has taken effect, there's a new phrase that keeps popping up in Washington: the ""continuing resolution."" If Congress doesn't pass a continuing resolution by March 27, the government will run out of money and will likely shut down. Here's a list of four things you might want to know about how a continuing resolution works and how it might soften the blow of the sequester.

1. Exactly what is a ""continuing resolution""?

The continuing resolution, or CR for short, is legislation that basically allows Congress to just carry over the previous fiscal year's budget into the next one. In other words, it permits Congress to maintain roughly the same budget priorities and budget levels over the subsequent year. A CR can last for any length of time, whatever Congress wants — a few weeks, six months, a year, anything.

2. Why would Congress want to pass a CR in the first place?

Let's back up a little bit. Every year, Congress has to set funding levels for agencies and departments. According to the Constitution, Congress is supposed to do this through appropriations bills. But when Congress can't agree on what those appropriations should look like, they punt, by passing a continuing resolution. Or, they can pass individual appropriations bills for some departments and use a CR for the rest of the departments if they can't hammer out those particular budgets. Often Congress just passes a CR to buy itself more time.

And if lawmakers can't even pass a CR before government funding runs out, the government could simply shut down.

3. Is there a real threat of a government shutdown in this case?

Both House Speaker John Boehner and President Obama seem to agree — they're not interested in that particular game of chicken. The last time the government shut down was in 1995 and 1996, during the Clinton presidency. Republicans paid a political price for that.

Actually, lawmakers in Washington are used to passing continuing resolutions. Over the past 40 years, the CR has been the standard way of doing business on Capitol Hill. Going through the full, traditional appropriations process is a now very rare event in Washington.

4. So how does the continuing resolution interact with the sequester?

Oh, right, there's the sequester. Because a sequester is in effect, figuring out what a budget will look like under a continuing resolution is going to be messier. As budget expert Stan Collender of Qorvis Communications put it, ""What's going to happen in March is a new definition of the phrase 'March Madness.' It will have less to do with college basketball and a lot to do with craziness in Washington on budget-related issues.""

Collender says because the continuing resolution is legislation that's coming after the sequester, it could theoretically cancel or modify the sequester — if Congress and the White House can agree on something. Because a CR is ""must-pass"" legislation, it offers Congress and the White House another opportunity to take a look at funding for fiscal year 2013, which ends Sept. 30, and possibly figure out a way to replace the sequester.

The House has just taken the first stab at a CR. The chairman of the House Appropriations Committee has introduced a bill that keeps the sequester in place but reallocates funding within the departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, to help cushion the impact of the cuts. It's a way for Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Ky., to determine budget priorities rather than letting the White House do it.

But actually reversing the sequester will take a lot more than letting some departments reallocate money. It will likely include a mix of tax overhaul and cuts to entitlements, such as Medicare and Social Security. That fight could take a long time.",www.npr.org,center,vFSlZ6xHAvrjCB6R

Among the proposed cuts , the administration wants to trim defense spending by an additional $ 100 billion and domestic programs by an extra $ 100 billion over the next decade .
The budget proposes cutting $ 400 billion from Medicare and other health care programs over a decade . The cuts would come in a variety of ways , including negotiating better prescription drug prices and asking wealthy seniors to pay more .
It would obtain an additional $ 200 billion in savings by scaling back farm subsidies and trimming federal retiree programs .
Congress and the administration have already secured $ 2.5 trillion in deficit reduction over the next 10 years through budget reductions and with the end-of-year tax increase on the rich . Obama 's plan would bring that total to $ 4.3 trillion over 10 years .
It is unlikely that Congress will get down to serious budget negotiations until this summer , when the government once again will be confronted with the need to raise the government 's borrowing limit or face the prospect of a first-ever default on U.S. debt .

Paul Ryan , Rep. Jeb Hensarling and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise are pictured How GOP 's play on spending could backfire
Who loses more if Republicans bail out again on the annual appropriations bills : the White House or the GOP itself ?
The political right is up in arms over President Barack Obama ’ s planned announcement Thursday that he will use his executive authority to shield millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation proceedings . And the argument goes that by pushing the pause button , Republicans in Congress can somehow punish the president because he believes most in an activist government .
But in truth , the landscape is very different from just a year ago , and the numbers show that Obama gets little new money in 2015 whatever the outcome , while the GOP may be cutting off its nose to spite its face .
The options include an outright shutdown or bare-bones continuing resolution — either short or long term . But all these alternatives fall short of an omnibus spending bill or even hybrid CR and would sacrifice important pieces of the Republican agenda .
For example , the GOP prides itself on caring about national defense , but a CR means Congress is walking away from updating the Pentagon ’ s $ 91 billion-plus procurement account . After enduring election-year attacks for being insensitive to women , Republicans would be turning their backs on $ 41 million in new money promised last spring to help state and local police investigate unsolved rape cases . And for all the talk of growing jobs with more foreign trade , money would be lost to make American ports more operational .
Last June , the Republican-controlled House approved at least $ 1.1 billion to address the backlog in dredging waterways — a big issue for the lower Mississippi River and major ports in Southern red states . If Congress now goes with a CR , Obama loses nothing here . In fact , the president gets to spend what he thinks best — almost $ 200 million less than what Republicans want .
But perhaps the greatest irony lies with the United States Citizenship and Information Services , or USCIS , an agency within the Department of Homeland Security that would be charged with implementing any new executive order from Obama .
The USCIS estimated budget of $ 3.2 billion is funded from fees collected on processing applications . While Congress can impose limits on those expenditures , it is largely independent of the more general appropriations process . Thus , if Republicans were to shut down the government or revert to a stopgap CR , it would do little or nothing to impact the very same agency charged with implementing the president ’ s decision .
“ From a state like Alaska , where we have more federal employees per capita than any state out there , more public lands than any other state , a CR is a lousy way to run a government , ” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski . | Getty
These examples are much more than a few odd Washington Monument false closings . For anyone who looks , the numbers show a troubling pattern for the GOP .
From weather satellites , to Western lands policies and Indian health services — even the 2020 census , Republican priorities are at stake . What were all those Benghazi hearings about if the GOP is going to walk away now from new funding for embassy security ? If immigration is the dominant issue of the day , does the GOP want to bail on the millions approved by the House to hire more judges to reduce the backlog of cases — over 400,000 at the end of the summer ?
“ They are blinded by their political opposition to Obama , ” said Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois , who doubles as a floor manager for the Pentagon ’ s appropriations bill . In that measure alone , literally scores of decisions would be put on hold under a CR . These impact the long-term costs of contracts and new starts for the Air Force and Army , not to mention the first national competition to replace , yes , a missile engine made in Vladimir Putin ’ s Russia .
In Washington these days , it ’ s become almost a cottage industry to psychoanalyze the president . Is it time to consider the reverse : how Obama gets inside the GOP ’ s head ?
Obama is a Democrat whose administration has initiated more than 225,000 deportation proceedings annually — 11,000 more than his Republican predecessor , George W. Bush . Moreover , Obama has done this from a smaller pool as border crossings have dropped significantly from the early levels under Bush .
Recent estimates by the Pew Research Center indicate that the population of undocumented immigrants in the United States has been relatively stable at about 11.3 million — down by about 1 million from its peak before the Great Recession , which Obama inherited after the 2008 election .
“ What I worry is we do a lazy job of managing the money , ” said Sen. Lamar Alexander . “ We ’ ve cut out a project every year for the past three years . Whenever we do a CR we waste money by not doing that. ” | AP Photo
In the same period , Republicans have largely succeeded in boxing in the president by denying him the increased domestic discretionary funding he once hoped for in his last years in office .
The budget deal in December a year ago , allowed the administration to restore about $ 22.5 billion for nondefense spending reduced by sequestration . But the cap for nondefense appropriations in this 2015 cycle is virtually frozen at $ 492.4 billion . In 2016 , the needle barely moves again .
In 2011 , House Republicans could argue that they were able to force real cuts through a series of short-term continuing resolutions , which narrowly averted a shutdown . But the world is a different place today .
In fact , when adjusted for inflation , the 2015 cap on nondefense appropriations is already well below what Bush enjoyed at the end of his presidency six years ago .
This context is important to understanding the budding confrontation now .
Obama — a lame-duck president faced with a Republican Congress — is proposing to use his executive authority to buy leeway for himself on who will next be deported from the U.S . The president ’ s critics argue this is a desperate overreach to try to permanently reshape the battlefield over immigration reform by potentially issuing work permits to millions . But if Obama is going too far using his executive power , is the best response for Congress to walk away from its constitutional power of the purse ?
Part of this is language .

Who loses more if Republicans bail out again on the annual appropriations bills: the White House or the GOP itself?

The political right is up in arms over President Barack Obama’s planned announcement Thursday that he will use his executive authority to shield millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation proceedings. And the argument goes that by pushing the pause button, Republicans in Congress can somehow punish the president because he believes most in an activist government.

But in truth, the landscape is very different from just a year ago, and the numbers show that Obama gets little new money in 2015 whatever the outcome, while the GOP may be cutting off its nose to spite its face.

The options include an outright shutdown or bare-bones continuing resolution — either short or long term. But all these alternatives fall short of an omnibus spending bill or even hybrid CR and would sacrifice important pieces of the Republican agenda.

For example, the GOP prides itself on caring about national defense, but a CR means Congress is walking away from updating the Pentagon’s $91 billion-plus procurement account. After enduring election-year attacks for being insensitive to women, Republicans would be turning their backs on $41 million in new money promised last spring to help state and local police investigate unsolved rape cases. And for all the talk of growing jobs with more foreign trade, money would be lost to make American ports more operational.

Last June, the Republican-controlled House approved at least $1.1 billion to address the backlog in dredging waterways — a big issue for the lower Mississippi River and major ports in Southern red states. If Congress now goes with a CR, Obama loses nothing here. In fact, the president gets to spend what he thinks best — almost $200 million less than what Republicans want.

( Also on POLITICO: Liberal 'hell no' caucus rises)

But perhaps the greatest irony lies with the United States Citizenship and Information Services, or USCIS, an agency within the Department of Homeland Security that would be charged with implementing any new executive order from Obama.

The USCIS estimated budget of $3.2 billion is funded from fees collected on processing applications. While Congress can impose limits on those expenditures, it is largely independent of the more general appropriations process. Thus, if Republicans were to shut down the government or revert to a stopgap CR, it would do little or nothing to impact the very same agency charged with implementing the president’s decision.

“From a state like Alaska, where we have more federal employees per capita than any state out there, more public lands than any other state, a CR is a lousy way to run a government,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski. | Getty

These examples are much more than a few odd Washington Monument false closings. For anyone who looks, the numbers show a troubling pattern for the GOP.

From weather satellites, to Western lands policies and Indian health services — even the 2020 census, Republican priorities are at stake. What were all those Benghazi hearings about if the GOP is going to walk away now from new funding for embassy security? If immigration is the dominant issue of the day, does the GOP want to bail on the millions approved by the House to hire more judges to reduce the backlog of cases — over 400,000 at the end of the summer?

( Also on POLITICO: Perry: Texas might sue Obama)

“They are blinded by their political opposition to Obama,” said Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois, who doubles as a floor manager for the Pentagon’s appropriations bill. In that measure alone, literally scores of decisions would be put on hold under a CR. These impact the long-term costs of contracts and new starts for the Air Force and Army, not to mention the first national competition to replace, yes, a missile engine made in Vladimir Putin’s Russia.

In Washington these days, it’s become almost a cottage industry to psychoanalyze the president. Is it time to consider the reverse: how Obama gets inside the GOP’s head?

Again, follow the numbers.

Obama is a Democrat whose administration has initiated more than 225,000 deportation proceedings annually — 11,000 more than his Republican predecessor, George W. Bush. Moreover, Obama has done this from a smaller pool as border crossings have dropped significantly from the early levels under Bush.

Recent estimates by the Pew Research Center indicate that the population of undocumented immigrants in the United States has been relatively stable at about 11.3 million — down by about 1 million from its peak before the Great Recession, which Obama inherited after the 2008 election.

“What I worry is we do a lazy job of managing the money,” said Sen. Lamar Alexander. “We’ve cut out a project every year for the past three years. Whenever we do a CR we waste money by not doing that.” | AP Photo

In the same period, Republicans have largely succeeded in boxing in the president by denying him the increased domestic discretionary funding he once hoped for in his last years in office.

The budget deal in December a year ago, allowed the administration to restore about $22.5 billion for nondefense spending reduced by sequestration. But the cap for nondefense appropriations in this 2015 cycle is virtually frozen at $492.4 billion. In 2016, the needle barely moves again.

In 2011, House Republicans could argue that they were able to force real cuts through a series of short-term continuing resolutions, which narrowly averted a shutdown. But the world is a different place today.

In fact, when adjusted for inflation, the 2015 cap on nondefense appropriations is already well below what Bush enjoyed at the end of his presidency six years ago.

This context is important to understanding the budding confrontation now.

Obama — a lame-duck president faced with a Republican Congress — is proposing to use his executive authority to buy leeway for himself on who will next be deported from the U.S. The president’s critics argue this is a desperate overreach to try to permanently reshape the battlefield over immigration reform by potentially issuing work permits to millions. But if Obama is going too far using his executive power, is the best response for Congress to walk away from its constitutional power of the purse?

Part of this is language. In Washington shorthand, the 12 annual appropriations bills are commonly written off as simply “funding” the government or “keeping the doors open.” Major newspapers largely ignore the process, and it has become such a shambles in recent years that many in Congress have no idea of how it is supposed to work.

This disorder feeds into the rhetoric that Congress is “shutting down” Obama by denying funds. But instead of “funding” the government, if the bills were described as “managing” the government, the tone might be very different.

Listen to Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) — a former governor — describe his role in writing the annual energy and water budget.

“What I worry is that we do a lazy job of managing the money,” Alexander said. “Like in our energy and water subcommittee, we’ve cut out a project every year for the past three years. Whenever we do a CR, we waste money by not doing that.”

Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the required threshold for passing a constitutional amendment. Both the House and Senate would have to approve the proposed amendment by supermajority votes.

WASHINGTON – The Republican-led House of Representatives will vote this week on a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, an effort to quell anger from conservative activists who say Congress presides over a ballooning debt and out-of-control spending.

What's in — and what's out — of the $1.3 trillion spending bill

There are conversations between House Republican leaders and the White House about ways to rescind sections of the spending bill Trump signed into law, a leadership aide confirmed to USA TODAY.

Michael Steel, a Republican strategist, said a vote on a so-called rescission package would be “very smart politically, to remind people that the Republican Party is dedicated to fiscal conservatism.”

Steel, an aide to John Boehner when he was House speaker, said passing the spending bill was necessary to give the military a spending boost, but coming back and cutting out certain provisions is a good way to show Republicans are committed to cut “wasteful Washington spending.”

“Why enter into a budget agreement and then an omnibus appropriations bill if you intend to undo it in a few weeks?” said Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., a moderate member of the Appropriations Committee who helped write the spending bill. “I’m very concerned that rescinding the dollars that were just agreed to will make it extremely difficult to enter into future agreements on appropriations.”

Democrats echoed that message.

The administration in recent weeks has made doomsday predictions about the impact of the cuts . And the White House so far has appeared unwilling to accept a Republican offer to give the president more autonomy in making the cuts , covering $ 85 billion this fiscal year , to help reduce the impact on some of the most essential or hardest-hit programs or agencies .
Some political strategists say the president hopes the cuts hurt enough to compel Republican lawmakers seeking re-election next year to end them by agreeing to more tax increases .
On Sunday , Gene Sperling , the White House ’ s top economic adviser , suggested Republicans would indeed make this decision .
“ Our hope is , as more Republicans start to see this pain in their own districts , they will choose bipartisan compromise over this absolutist position , ” he said .
Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack , during a House hearing Tuesday , was asked by South Dakota Republican Rep. Kristi Noem about the Brown email .
Vilsack said he was unaware of the email , but denied the administration has a policy of being inflexible and maximizing the cuts ’ impact .

And the White House so far has appeared unwilling to accept a Republican offer to give the president more autonomy in making the cuts, covering $85 billion this fiscal year, to help reduce the impact on some of the most essential or hardest-hit programs or agencies.

Some political strategists say the president hopes the cuts hurt enough to compel Republican lawmakers seeking re-election next year to end them by agreeing to more tax increases.

On Sunday, Gene Sperling, the White House’s top economic adviser, suggested Republicans would indeed make this decision.

“Our hope is, as more Republicans start to see this pain in their own districts, they will choose bipartisan compromise over this absolutist position,” he said.

Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, during a House hearing Tuesday, was asked by South Dakota Republican Rep. Kristi Noem about the Brown email.

Vilsack said he was unaware of the email, but denied the administration has a policy of being inflexible and maximizing the cuts’ impact.

“I wouldn’t say that we’ve said no to flexibility,” Vilsack said. “But there are certain circumstances where we don’t have flexibility.”

“I’m hopeful that isn’t an agenda that has been put forward,"" Noem said.",www.foxnews.com,right,7AK7boMXJ40uX65H

It could pave the way for future bipartisanship

But contentious issues and an election year could hamper progress

When Republican Rep. Paul Ryan and Democratic Sen. Patty Murray held a news conference -- together -- to announce that they reached a deal on the federal budget, the ideological opposites received immediate praise for their cooperation.

And they reached their agreement that would avert a potential government shutdown in January just two days before the Congressionally imposed deadline for doing so.

While she suggested the act of working together has the potential to influence the mood in Congress to be more agreeable, the deal removes a significant obstacle that has led to legislative gridlock so far this decade.

The deal split the difference between the amount that Republicans and Democrats wanted to spend -- $1.012 trillion for 2014 and $1.014 trillion for 2015.

""This means we can fund the operations of government through regular, annual appropriations bills, instead of through last-minute, stop-gap bills that put the government on autopilot,"" said Sen. Barbara Mikulski, who sits at the head of the Appropriations Committee.

A big deal

That's a big deal. It's the first time that a budget agreement has passed a divided House and the Senate since 1986, according to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.

""Gridlock has got to end and it is ending,"" Reid told reporters. ""It's really a step forward.""

But will it end gridlock?

""No,"" Congressional scholar Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution said.

""I don't expect it to have any lasting consequences,"" Mann said.

The budget agreement only solves part of the problem. While it sets spending levels, it doesn't actually allocate the money and doesn't specify how the money can be spent.

That battle will begin immediately.

Appropriations Committee members must agree before January 15 -- the deadline set by Congress in October for a new spending plan to be in place -- on how to divvy up the money.

For instance, Republicans will want more money for the military. Democrats will want more money for Head Start programs.

""We may not even be through with this,"" Mann said.

And that's not the only issue of contention to be worked out in January alone.

Extended unemployment insurance benefits are set to expire December 28, which will leave 1.3 million people without benefits and hit another 800,000 in the coming weeks.

Despite the looming deadline, the issue was shelved in order to reach a budget deal.

Reid vowed to address the issue immediately upon the Senate's return in January. Republicans, however, are not keen on the extending the already expanded program.

Again?

Before the budget deal even becomes law, signs of serious strife are already emerging around the debt ceiling, the nation's borrowing limit, which is expected to be tapped in February.

Since 2010, the debt limit has sparked partisan fights and near-government shutdowns as Republicans want an increase in the debt ceiling tied to spending cuts.

""I can't imagine the Republicans want another fight on debt ceiling,"" Reid told reporters Tuesday.

But they are. And the foundation is being laid for a major battle in the new year.

""We don't want nothing out of this debt limit,"" Ryan said Sunday on Fox News.

Over in the Senate, the sentiment is similar. A top Republican indicated that he expects his caucus to push for concessions related to reducing government spending.

""Every time the President asks us to raise the debt ceiling is a good time to try to achieve something important for the country,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday.

An election year

Further complicating this so-called season of bipartisanship is that 2014 is an election year, historically a time when less gets accomplished in Congress as lawmakers become even more risk averse and spend even more time fund-raising and campaigning.

Lawmakers up for re-election are reluctant to take risky votes. And a decent indicator of how Congress deals with next year's prickly battles is that all seven Republican Senators facing primary challengers in 2014 were opponents of the budget deal.

And in the House, where all members are up for reelection, primary challengers are also common, forcing lawmakers to appeal to party activists often by shunning compromise.

And that is unlikely to subside.

Even though House Speaker John Boehner surprisingly criticized conservative groups publicly last week, no one on Capitol Hill expects the Ohio Republican to become the champion of bipartisanship.

To be determined

A host of issues still need to be worked out, including the Farm Bill, which affects the price consumers pay for groceries, payments to doctors who see Medicare patients, and immigration.

And even the budget deal were to be reworked post-passage. Some lawmakers, including South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, vow to reverse a provision that reduces retirement benefits for military families.

Mann said the budget deal is a singular instance of cooperation because it played into both parties best interests. Both parties avoided being labeled obstructionists and extremists.

""This isn't about good feelings among members but strategic behavior by two parties,"" Mann said.

It comes after much fiscal turbulence , including the first government shutdown in 17 years in October .
A . If the House and Senate approve of the deal , which was hammered out by budget negotiators Rep. Paul Ryan ( R ) of Wisconsin and Sen. Patty Murray ( D ) of Washington , the government will be funded for the next two fiscal years . That means a reprieve from budget brinkmanship – and shutdown . But another fiscal landmine could explode . The United States will hit its debt ceiling in the first half of next year . If lawmakers refuse to raise the ceiling , the US could face the possibility of defaulting on its debt – sending economic shockwaves around the world .
Q . This is a relatively small deal . So why is it important ?
Its significance is that there is a deal at all . The House and Senate have not been able to agree on a budget since 2009 . The haggling , brinkmanship , and uncertainty , not to mention the October government shutdown , have had a drag effect on the economy , tarnished America ’ s reputation overseas , and fed the partisanship that has Americans now so disgusted with Congress .
“ It ’ s a good step in the right direction that can hopefully rebuild some trust and serve as a foundation for continued bipartisan work , ” said Senate Budget Chairman Murray in a statement .
A . This is no “ grand bargain. ” It does not trade tax increases – as Democrats want – for significant cuts to the expensive programs that drive long-term debt , such as Medicare and Social Security . That ’ s what Republicans wanted . In fact , it doesn ’ t really deal with long-term debt at all . What it does do is put a small dent in the deficit , reducing it by between $ 20 billion and $ 30 billion .
Q . Given the polarization in Washington , how was it possible to reach this agreement ?
A. It ’ s precisely because its scope is so narrow that Ryan and Murray were able to come to agreement . They knew they would not be able to get their respective caucuses to agree to the big stuff , or even what some consider medium stuff – such as closing corporate tax loopholes or using a less costly method of figuring Social Security checks .
The other reason they could agree is because they were the ones working it out . They may be ideological opposites , but they are both highly pragmatic . And they adhered to that warning about too many cooks in the kitchen spoiling the broth . This was a Ryan-Murray creation , which certainly makes it easier to actually put a deal on the table .
A . The House is expected to take up the agreement , called the Bipartisan Budget Act , before its recesses for the Christmas holiday on Friday . Then it ’ s the Senate ’ s turn . But it ’ s still not certain that the bill will pass both houses . Democrats will be upset that the deal does not include an extension of jobless benefits , set to expire later this month . Conservatives will be upset that the full sequester is not in force , and that a more serious attempt at debt reduction was not made .
Some conservatives have already begun lining up against the deal . Influential tea party leader Rep. Tim Huelskamp ( R ) of Kansas said on CNN 's `` Crossfire '' Tuesday that he will not vote for it . That means House Speaker John Boehner ( R ) of Ohio might need to rely on Democratic votes to get the deal through the House – something he has been reluctant to do in the past .

But Ryan said the deal “ reduces the deficit – without raising taxes. ” It is a “ firm step in the right direction . ”
In Washington , where it is so difficult to put a foot forward , one step can seem like a giant leap .","House and Senate budget negotiators in Washington have reached a deal to fund the federal government and avoid a government shutdown on Jan. 15. It comes after much fiscal turbulence, including the first government shutdown in 17 years in October.

Q. Does this mean the budget drama is over?

A. If the House and Senate approve of the deal, which was hammered out by budget negotiators Rep. Paul Ryan (R) of Wisconsin and Sen. Patty Murray (D) of Washington, the government will be funded for the next two fiscal years. That means a reprieve from budget brinkmanship – and shutdown. But another fiscal landmine could explode. The United States will hit its debt ceiling in the first half of next year. If lawmakers refuse to raise the ceiling, the US could face the possibility of defaulting on its debt – sending economic shockwaves around the world.

Q. This is a relatively small deal. So why is it important?

A. This agreement is more important for its politics than for its numbers. The compromise is indeed small, funding the government at $1.012 trillion annually – about halfway between the Senate budget of $1.058 trillion and the House budget of $967 billion. It softens the automatic spending cuts, known as the “sequester,” by only $63 billion, but doesn’t get rid of it. It splits the sequester relief evenly between the Pentagon and nondefense programs. [Editor's note: The original version has been changed to give the correct dollar amount for the original House budget.]

Its significance is that there is a deal at all. The House and Senate have not been able to agree on a budget since 2009. The haggling, brinkmanship, and uncertainty, not to mention the October government shutdown, have had a drag effect on the economy, tarnished America’s reputation overseas, and fed the partisanship that has Americans now so disgusted with Congress.

“It’s a good step in the right direction that can hopefully rebuild some trust and serve as a foundation for continued bipartisan work,” said Senate Budget Chairman Murray in a statement.

Q. You said it’s a small deal. What’s missing?

A. This is no “grand bargain.” It does not trade tax increases – as Democrats want – for significant cuts to the expensive programs that drive long-term debt, such as Medicare and Social Security. That’s what Republicans wanted. In fact, it doesn’t really deal with long-term debt at all. What it does do is put a small dent in the deficit, reducing it by between $20 billion and $30 billion.

Q. Given the polarization in Washington, how was it possible to reach this agreement?

A. It’s precisely because its scope is so narrow that Ryan and Murray were able to come to agreement. They knew they would not be able to get their respective caucuses to agree to the big stuff, or even what some consider medium stuff – such as closing corporate tax loopholes or using a less costly method of figuring Social Security checks.

The other reason they could agree is because they were the ones working it out. They may be ideological opposites, but they are both highly pragmatic. And they adhered to that warning about too many cooks in the kitchen spoiling the broth. This was a Ryan-Murray creation, which certainly makes it easier to actually put a deal on the table.

Q. What happens next?

A. The House is expected to take up the agreement, called the Bipartisan Budget Act, before its recesses for the Christmas holiday on Friday. Then it’s the Senate’s turn. But it’s still not certain that the bill will pass both houses. Democrats will be upset that the deal does not include an extension of jobless benefits, set to expire later this month. Conservatives will be upset that the full sequester is not in force, and that a more serious attempt at debt reduction was not made.

Some conservatives have already begun lining up against the deal. Influential tea party leader Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R) of Kansas said on CNN's ""Crossfire"" Tuesday that he will not vote for it. That means House Speaker John Boehner (R) of Ohio might need to rely on Democratic votes to get the deal through the House – something he has been reluctant to do in the past.

But Ryan said the deal “reduces the deficit – without raising taxes.” It is a “firm step in the right direction.”

Here’s looking at you, Harry Reid. In the final days leading up to the expiration date for America’s “temporary budget,” the House of Representatives passed a continuing resolution that will fund all parts of the government at sequestration levels through Dec. 15. It just won’t fund Obamacare.

The Republicans’ position is reasonable. If the health care law isn’t ready to be implemented in full, the American people should not be paying for it. No Republican is calling for a government shutdown, because that doesn’t defund Obamacare. We are demanding an Obamacare shutdown. You can fund the government without funding Obamacare, and after thousands of calls from constituents nationwide and a tumultuous August town hall recess, the House has found a way to do exactly that.

One has to wonder why Mr. Reid, the Senate majority leader, and the Senate Democrats so vehemently defend a law that has been a revolving door of procedural failures and harmful unintended consequences.

To date, there have been more than 20 delays, exemptions and revisions to Obamacare, including a delay of the employer mandate for businesses. Sen. Max Baucus, Montana Democrat, one of the law’s primary architects, predicted that implementation of the 2,000-plus page law would prove a “train wreck.”

Obamacare disproportionately burdens the most vulnerable among us. Young Americans will pay higher costs to subsidize the older and wealthier. According to Investor’s Business Daily, four different industries have cut their workweeks below 30 hours since Obamacare was signed into law, harming low-income hourly-wage earners the most.

Public discontent for the law continues to grow. A recent FreedomWorks national poll found that an overwhelming 82 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents favor a continuing resolution that “does not include funding for Obamacare.”

Only 17 percent of all voters think Obamacare will have positive personal impact, a new low point since the law was passed in March 2010. Sixty-two percent of all voters prefer a “patient-centered” health care system that allows for competition and choice. The people have spoken, and members of Congress are beholden to their constituents — not the other way around.

Then why would Mr. Reid refuse to compromise, and instead strip the defunding language from the continuing resolution and hold the government hostage?

President Obama has been nothing if not disappointing for the Democrats. Something was supposed to have changed with Mr. Obama’s election. Things were supposed to be different. At the 2004 Democratic National Convention’s keynote address, then-Illinois state Sen. Obama told Americans “there is not a liberal America and a conservative America. There is a United States of America.” With a straight face he vowed, “we are one people.”

In hindsight, the president predicted his own legacy’s demise. Ironically, he has managed to unite a nation in opposition to an unpopular, ineffectual and unconstitutional agenda.

Americans on all parts of the political spectrum shook their heads as they watched the White House remain a revolving door of lobbyists and special-interest groups. Disappointment ensued when top Obama officials cashed in to join corporations such as BP, which they once demonized in the media, while the White House filled its job openings with former Goldman Sachs employees.

Only this administration could unite organizations as ideologically diverse as FreedomWorks and MoveOn.org as American troops rotate overseas to fight expensive wars, and the president threatens additional military action in Syria.

The Teamsters and Young Americans for Liberty stand together in opposition to Obamacare. Even AFL-CIO President Richard L. Trumka admitted this year that “we made some mistakes” in writing Obamacare, and did not expect to see employers reduce work hours to avoid some of the law’s penalties.

I’ve actually stood shoulder-to-unlikely-shoulder at press conferences between Rep. Louie Gohmert and ACLU leadership to resist Mr. Obama’s sweeping surveillance state.

It wasn’t supposed to work out this way for the Democrats. Mr. Reid wasn’t supposed to lead a majority that’s been unable to pass a real budget for two congressional terms. The president’s budget was so bad, it received zero votes in 2011. Not zero Republican votes; no votes, period.

My advice to House and Senate Republicans? Stick to your guns. Stand by the continuing resolution passed by the House that will fund all parts of the government without funding the broken health care law, and do it without any strings attached. Then go home, and turn on the news and watch the Chicken Littles on the left tell us the sky is falling.

The House Republicans did their job. It’s Mr. Reid’s turn to make a choice. Pass the House’s continuing resolution, or explain to the American people why preserving the last vestiges of the president’s legacy is more important than funding the basic functions of government.

But those in power and closest to the situation say a debt default is a bigger threat. That’s the thinking at the highest levels of Congress as Washington dives headfirst into a contentious fall.

Story Continued Below

Here’s the reality: Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) will eventually have to bring a funding bill to the House floor that keeps the government — and Obamacare — running. That’s the bill the House will most likely receive from the Senate shortly after Boehner’s chamber resumes work on Wednesday, just days short of an Oct. 1 government shutdown.

That’s because the Senate will not accept the entirety of the three-month $986 billion continuing resolution that Boehner will attempt to pass Friday. The Senate will strip the language that’s meant to defund President Barack Obama’s health care law — strong language that was drafted to appease Boehner’s right wing. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), however, can remove that Obamacare provision with a simple majority vote in the upper chamber.

If Reid is successful and the Senate clears the revised continuing resolution, Boehner and House Republicans will then be back in the spotlight. And the speaker may need the support of House Democrats to pass the measure.

It won’t be pretty, but that so-called clean CR could pass the House with roughly 180 Republican votes with the remainder coming from the Democratic side of the aisle, according to senior GOP sources.

Over in the Senate, the chamber’s rules dictate that Reid will face at least one expected Republican filibuster on the government funding bill — meaning he has to muster 60 votes to cut off debate.

It’s really that simple. Good legislation, like good food, movies, novels, and pretty much everything else except for dogs (they’re all good), is in the eye of the beholder. A politician or partisan who thinks a proposal is worth doing will think it’s worth doing even if it increases the deficit. If he thinks a proposal is bad, he might argue that it’s bad on the merits.

Republicans have used the weapon of a shutdown to cripple Democratic presidents , he says
Zelizer : When a tactic such as threatening to veto debt limit increase is used , it becomes the new normal
He says some in GOP are outraged , and now is a good time to talk about reforming budget process
The budget battles continue to rage . Every time the Congress and the president reach another resolution over taxes and spending -- the new fiscal cliff -- another round of fighting begins .
At best , the government manages to operate based on continuing resolutions , temporary stopgap measures that indicate the budget process is dysfunctional . At worst , the federal government shuts down -- as it might this week -- or Congress will fail to raise the debt ceiling in a few more weeks . The impact of these fights could be horrendous for the economy .
Few dispute that our budget process is broken . But the nation is so buried in the weeds , trying to scramble out of each specific budget battle , that there is hardly time to step back and understand what dynamics are driving this process .
Partisan strategy is one of the main culprits . Polarization has made almost every issue more contentious on Capitol Hill . But in recent years , Republicans in particular have taken the initiative to use the budget as a way to handcuff Democratic presidents .
The strategy has deep roots . In 1966 and 1967 , conservative Southern Democrats and Midwestern Republicans focused attention on the rising deficits to force President Lyndon Johnson to accept deep spending cuts and bring his opportunities for enacting more legislation to an end .
In 1995 and 1996 , Republicans shut down the federal government with their push for spending cuts . Even after the backlash helped President Bill Clinton regain his political standing , which had plummeted after the 1994 election , the GOP continued to insist on spending cuts through the remainder of Clinton 's term , leaving him little opportunity to do much more than to try and curtail their demands .
Since 2010 , a growing number of Republicans have been willing to use aggressive techniques to force President Barack Obama 's hand on this issue . They have demonstrated that they would be fine with shutting down the government and they have threatened to not raise the debt ceiling -- which would send the country into default .
To be sure there have been moments when Democrats have challenged Republican presidents as well . The difference is they have usually done so symbolically to make a statement about Republican policies , whereas the new generation of Republicans appears willing to follow through on the threat .

Republicans have used the weapon of a shutdown to cripple Democratic presidents, he says

Zelizer: When a tactic such as threatening to veto debt limit increase is used, it becomes the new normal

He says some in GOP are outraged, and now is a good time to talk about reforming budget process

The budget battles continue to rage. Every time the Congress and the president reach another resolution over taxes and spending -- the new fiscal cliff -- another round of fighting begins.

At best, the government manages to operate based on continuing resolutions, temporary stopgap measures that indicate the budget process is dysfunctional. At worst, the federal government shuts down -- as it might this week -- or Congress will fail to raise the debt ceiling in a few more weeks. The impact of these fights could be horrendous for the economy.

Few dispute that our budget process is broken. But the nation is so buried in the weeds, trying to scramble out of each specific budget battle, that there is hardly time to step back and understand what dynamics are driving this process.

Partisan strategy is one of the main culprits. Polarization has made almost every issue more contentious on Capitol Hill. But in recent years, Republicans in particular have taken the initiative to use the budget as a way to handcuff Democratic presidents.

Julian Zelizer

The strategy has deep roots. In 1966 and 1967, conservative Southern Democrats and Midwestern Republicans focused attention on the rising deficits to force President Lyndon Johnson to accept deep spending cuts and bring his opportunities for enacting more legislation to an end.

In 1995 and 1996, Republicans shut down the federal government with their push for spending cuts. Even after the backlash helped President Bill Clinton regain his political standing, which had plummeted after the 1994 election, the GOP continued to insist on spending cuts through the remainder of Clinton's term, leaving him little opportunity to do much more than to try and curtail their demands.

Since 2010, a growing number of Republicans have been willing to use aggressive techniques to force President Barack Obama's hand on this issue. They have demonstrated that they would be fine with shutting down the government and they have threatened to not raise the debt ceiling -- which would send the country into default.

To be sure there have been moments when Democrats have challenged Republican presidents as well. The difference is they have usually done so symbolically to make a statement about Republican policies, whereas the new generation of Republicans appears willing to follow through on the threat.

NEW YORK — Talk to anyone on Wall Street and they will tell you they really don ’ t care about the brewing fiscal storm in Washington . Possible government shutdown ? Whatever . Debt ceiling crisis ? Meh .
The prevailing view : When Congress returns in September , sabers will be rattled and threats will be hurled . But then , as usual , Washington will grind out a crummy deal that keeps the federal lights on and avoids a disastrous default .
“ D.C . always gets very close to the edge and then in the end finds an eleventh-hour solution , ” said Jan Hatzius , chief economist at Goldman Sachs . “ It seems hard to believe that we are going to have a really big problem ”
But this time — wait for it — could be different . Really , seriously different .
Here is just a sampling of why Wall Street may be wrong : The House GOP is hopelessly fractured on spending strategy . Senate Republicans who might otherwise broker a deal face primary challenges that make compromise potentially deadly . Other Senate Republicans are jockeying for 2016 . And congressional Democrats have no appetite for any bargain — grand or otherwise — that cuts entitlement spending .
President Barack Obama at his Friday news conference before leaving for vacation lectured Republicans and mocked their threats to shut down the government rather than fund his signature health care law . Hardly a promising sign for the fall .
“ The idea that you would shut down the government at a time when the recovery is getting some traction … , ” Obama said , “ I ’ m assuming that they will not take that path . I have confidence that common sense , in the end , will prevail . ”
And it is not just a government shutdown or debt-ceiling crisis that could cause a Beltway shakeup of markets this fall .
There is also the possibility of a nasty confirmation fight for the next chairman of the Federal Reserve just as the central bank starts to wind down its program of buying hundreds of billions in bonds to support the economy .
Wrap all this potential dysfunction together and there is a real chance that the fall of 2013 will be more like the summer of 2011 , when a near-miss on the debt ceiling led to a ratings agency downgrade , a huge sell-off in the stock market and yet another hit to an economy that might otherwise be heating up nicely .
“ There ’ s going to be some pain that isn ’ t being priced into market expectations , ” said Compass Point Research & Trading analyst Isaac Boltansky . “ Right now the markets are doing well , but I don ’ t think it ’ s pricing in this impending battle. ” Or battles .
Leadership in both parties seem to want a continuing resolution in September that would fund the government through the end of the year . They may get it . But it ’ s not obvious how . And even if they do , raising the debt ceiling is a much bigger and potentially more damaging hurdle . Comments from lawmakers as they left town for August suggest how difficult it will be .
“ [ As ] the condition of raising the debt ceiling , we absolutely should insist on spending restraints , ” Sen. Pat Toomey ( R-Pa. ) told ███ . “ On the other side there ’ s an effort to try to minimize the magnitude of the fiscal challenge that we face because the deficit has gotten a little smaller in recent years . We shouldn ’ t be lulled into a false sense of complacency . We still are on a completely unsustainable fiscal path . ”
GOP Sens . Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas , perhaps with an eye on the 2016 presidential race , are demanding that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell block any spending bill that funds Obama ’ s health care law as enrollment begins Oct. 1 . There is no chance Obama would sign a spending bill that takes money away from implementation of his biggest achievement .
Meanwhile , McConnell and Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-S.C. ) , who might otherwise help push a fiscal compromise , face 2014 primary challenges that may make them less likely to cut deals with Obama . McConnell has been pivotal in recent battles , including the fiscal cliff deal his office hammered out at the last second with Vice President Joe Biden at New Years . Don ’ t expect a replay this fall .
On top of all this , McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner recently lost several top backroom negotiators to the private sector , making a path out of the current stalemate even tougher .","This time around, Wall Street may have a real cause for concern. Why Wall Street should worry

NEW YORK — Talk to anyone on Wall Street and they will tell you they really don’t care about the brewing fiscal storm in Washington. Possible government shutdown? Whatever. Debt ceiling crisis? Meh.

Senate Republicans who might otherwise broker a deal face primary challenges that make compromise potentially deadly. Other Senate Republicans are jockeying for 2016. And congressional Democrats have no appetite for any bargain — grand or otherwise — that cuts entitlement spending.

President Barack Obama at his Friday news conference before leaving for vacation lectured Republicans and mocked their threats to shut down the government rather than fund his signature health care law. Hardly a promising sign for the fall.

“The idea that you would shut down the government at a time when the recovery is getting some traction …,” Obama said, “I’m assuming that they will not take that path. I have confidence that common sense, in the end, will prevail.”

And it is not just a government shutdown or debt-ceiling crisis that could cause a Beltway shakeup of markets this fall.

There is also the possibility of a nasty confirmation fight for the next chairman of the Federal Reserve just as the central bank starts to wind down its program of buying hundreds of billions in bonds to support the economy.

Wrap all this potential dysfunction together and there is a real chance that the fall of 2013 will be more like the summer of 2011, when a near-miss on the debt ceiling led to a ratings agency downgrade, a huge sell-off in the stock market and yet another hit to an economy that might otherwise be heating up nicely.

“There’s going to be some pain that isn’t being priced into market expectations,” said Compass Point Research & Trading analyst Isaac Boltansky. “Right now the markets are doing well, but I don’t think it’s pricing in this impending battle.” Or battles.

( Also on POLITICO: Obama: No shutdown over ACA)

Leadership in both parties seem to want a continuing resolution in September that would fund the government through the end of the year. They may get it. But it’s not obvious how. And even if they do, raising the debt ceiling is a much bigger and potentially more damaging hurdle. Comments from lawmakers as they left town for August suggest how difficult it will be.

“[As] the condition of raising the debt ceiling, we absolutely should insist on spending restraints,” Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) told POLITICO. “On the other side there’s an effort to try to minimize the magnitude of the fiscal challenge that we face because the deficit has gotten a little smaller in recent years. We shouldn’t be lulled into a false sense of complacency. We still are on a completely unsustainable fiscal path.”

( Also on POLITICO: Romney warns of shutdown)

GOP Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas, perhaps with an eye on the 2016 presidential race, are demanding that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell block any spending bill that funds Obama’s health care law as enrollment begins Oct. 1. There is no chance Obama would sign a spending bill that takes money away from implementation of his biggest achievement.

Meanwhile, McConnell and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who might otherwise help push a fiscal compromise, face 2014 primary challenges that may make them less likely to cut deals with Obama. McConnell has been pivotal in recent battles, including the fiscal cliff deal his office hammered out at the last second with Vice President Joe Biden at New Years. Don’t expect a replay this fall.

On top of all this, McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner recently lost several top backroom negotiators to the private sector, making a path out of the current stalemate even tougher.",www.politico.com,left,BKgm0IZhPfHgZlF3

OK, the conventional wisdom about the budget President Obama sent to Congress yesterday is that's irrelevant.

It's two months late, after all, and the House and Senate have already approved their own spending blueprints for fiscal 2014.

But here's why it matters when it comes to health.

First of all, the Congressional budget process isn't exactly done. The House and Senate still haven't met to merge their differing proposals (and they are very different) into a consensus plan. So the president's formal input could still mean something, at least in theory.

Second, Congress hasn't yet begun its annual appropriations process, where a little over a third of federal spending is determined. So it's not too late for the president's wish list for spending for next year for agencies like the National Institutes of Health ($31.3 billion, up $471 million from fiscal 2012), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ($11.3 billion, down about $270 million) , and the Food and Drug Administration ($4.7 billion, up $821 million) to mean something.

Finally, late though it may be, the budget gives the administration the chance to make a statement about its legislative priorities, and, possibly, to lay a few bargaining chips on the table. Here are a few from the health portions.

Raising the tobacco tax to help pay for more early childhood education. This is a two-fer, according to CDC Director Tom Frieden.

Medicare and Medicaid changes: Most of these are holdovers from last year's budget and from the deficit reduction plan submitted in the fall of 2011. In all, it proposes about $371 billion in Medicare savings over the next decade, Sebelius said.

While most of the savings would come from reducing payments to health care providers, about $57 billion would come from increasing payments by beneficiaries.

Where the Government Gets Its Money

About half of the federal government’s money comes from income taxes. You also probably pay state and local taxes of various kinds, but we’re not calculating those today. Another 33 percent comes from payroll taxes—more about those in a minute. The rest comes from corporate income tax (11 percent) and excise, estate, and miscellaneous other taxes (9 percent). Most (99.5 percent) of us will never pay estate tax. You do pay some excise taxes, but they are worked into the price of your airline tickets, gas, cigarettes, alcohol, and so on.

How Much Do I, Personally, Pay?

A portion of each of your paychecks go to payroll taxes. Only about half of these come out of your salary; your employer pays the other half. It’s sort of “your” money, because if this tax didn’t exist, your employer would be able to add that money to your wages. (If you’re self employed, you pay it all yourself anyway.) When you add up social security, medicare, and unemployment insurance, payroll taxes total 15.3 percent of your salary, or a little less than that if you make above $118,500.

Here’s where your payroll taxes go. If you make $50,000, roughly the median household income in the US, you pay:

$6,200 to Social Security

$1,450 to Medicare

$420 to unemployment insurance.

Next, let’s consider your income tax. The exact amount you pay depends on your income and on all those other details that your tax forms ask about. If you have last year’s tax return handy, just take a look: that’s what you pay. Or to pick an example for the average household, let’s take a look at this chart, and average the tax contributions of people in the $25,000-$50,000 income range with those from the $50,000 to $100,000 range. That’s $4,061 in income tax for a typical Jane Taxpayer and her family.

What Do I Get for My Money?

To see where your money goes, let’s look at the federal budget and scale it down to the size of your contribution. This year’s budget is $3.65 trillion dollars. We already accounted for our share of Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment insurance, which cost the government $1.66 trillion in total. So we’re looking at about $2 trillion of other things the federal government pays for. Jane Taxpayer’s share of that is $4,061, remember, so every billion dollars of government spending works out to $2.03 out of her pocket.

The spending we’ve discussed so far is “mandatory,” meaning the government has to pay it to fulfill its own rules. When somebody becomes eligible for social security payments, for example, the law says they start getting the money, so there it goes. Mandatory spending also includes earned income tax credits and child tax credits, plus veterans’ benefits and federal employees’ retirement. The Congressional Budget Office has a snazzy chart here showing what’s included and how it changed from 2015 to 2016.

What’s left is discretionary spending, meaning the amounts can more easily change from year to year, at Congress’s discretion. Here’s some of what is included:

-- An email from USDA official Charles Brown rejecting a subordinate ’ s suggestion of a way to lessen the consequences of budget cuts for citizens .
Americans have a government that now claims the power to execute its own citizens on its own soil without trial but that can not find a way to afford public tours of government buildings .
Those two decrees on Tuesday from the Obama administration – Attorney General Eric Holder claiming the power for the president to use drones domestically to kill citizens and the White House closing its doors to public tours citing smaller increases to federal spending – sort of sum up the American moment , 2013 .
So what becomes of a government that claims the power to do almost anything but that can ’ t seem to do anything at all ? Nothing good .
While one might assume that it would be with some embarrassment that a president would see the White House shut to public tours – the people kept out of the people ’ s house – the messages from President Obama and his team about the stuttering and stumbling of the government these days seem to be : the worse the better .
The president believes vehemently that the federal government should be spending more , not less , right now . He has laid out a bold second-term agenda in which deficit spending and higher taxes on top earners will finance what he calls “ investments ” in things like green energy and education .
But because he has a worse relationship with Congress than perhaps any president since Richard Nixon and seems to despise the kind of deal making that has been necessary for all of his predecessors , Obama is stuck with automatic spending cuts .
Obama couldn ’ t muster a deal on the debt limit in 2011 , something George W. Bush accomplished with a Democratic congress and rock-bottom approval ratings , so the president devised and approved automatic reductions to automatic increases in spending . There is so little trust in the president among his foes that he had to build a dead-man switch into the deal to break the impasse .
Massive deficit spending , an ongoing absence of a budget and an inability to deal with Congress left Obama with little choice . But he believed that the cuts would be so odious that Congress would end up negating them .
But as we enter the age of sequestration , it turns out that cuts designed to be wretched are actually pretty popular .
Obama Democrats can take comfort in the fact that while voters generally agree that overall deficit reduction requires some tax increases in addition to spending cuts , but when it comes to the current debacle , the electorate is squarely against the president .
The latest Washington Post/ABC News poll shows 2-1 support for the spending reductions , and that ’ s not even limited to registered voters , a population that tends to be more fiscally conservative than the public at large .
Worse for Obama , the poll shows strong support for letting the cuts fall on the president ’ s preferred domestic spending programs but shielding the military . The poll , which actually overstates the size of the reductions , shows the president is getting shellacked on spending .
But rather than bow to public opinion , the president means to change it by making Americans believe that shaving less than 3 percent off of federal spending will cause a government that employs some 2 million civilians and spends some $ 3.6 trillion a year to grind to a halt .
What he has succeeded in doing , though , is turning the “ sequester ” into a punchline .
Did you hear the one about the agency that released 2,000 inmates citing the “ sequester ” while ordering $ 50 million in new uniforms ?
Voters had been hearing for weeks about flight delays , worker furloughs , laid off teachers , empty firehouses , tainted meat and unsecured borders . Between Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , voters had reason to believe that last week ’ s deadline would turn the United States into a less orderly version of Somalia .
But nothing happened . And the president had to admit as much last week when Republicans refused to cave in to Obama ’ s demands for another round of tax increases and let the ax fall .
As an internal email from the Agriculture Department shows , the intention is to maximize and expedite the pain from the cuts . An administrator , acting on what he said were orders from the top , told his subordinates not to find ways around the cuts but rather to let taxpayers feel the pain as promised .
The president , after weeks of attacking and denouncing his foes , is opening up the lines of communication with Senate Republicans . He is hoping that they will break with their House colleagues and yield on the cuts . If he can get the Senate GOP to do what they did on the suite of tax increases at the beginning of the year , Obama hopes that he can push spending back up .
Like a detective working over two suspects , Obama will offer the Senate Republicans one chance to turn on their confederates . Take the deal or everybody is going up the river together .
But what Obama has to offer in the way of a threat right now isn ’ t much . He is trying to make Republicans the villains from the cuts , but so far voters seem to think he ’ s blowing smoke .
By starting the scare tactics so early and so comically , the president has turned himself into the Keynesian who cried wolf . By the time the moment for an actual government shutdown arrives at the end of the month , Obama may not have much credibility left on the subject .
The White House closure is especially bad for the president .

-- An email from USDA official Charles Brown rejecting a subordinate’s suggestion of a way to lessen the consequences of budget cuts for citizens.

Americans have a government that now claims the power to execute its own citizens on its own soil without trial but that cannot find a way to afford public tours of government buildings.

Those two decrees on Tuesday from the Obama administration – Attorney General Eric Holder claiming the power for the president to use drones domestically to kill citizens and the White House closing its doors to public tours citing smaller increases to federal spending – sort of sum up the American moment, 2013.

So what becomes of a government that claims the power to do almost anything but that can’t seem to do anything at all? Nothing good.

While one might assume that it would be with some embarrassment that a president would see the White House shut to public tours – the people kept out of the people’s house – the messages from President Obama and his team about the stuttering and stumbling of the government these days seem to be: the worse the better.

Obama has a big problem on his hands.

The president believes vehemently that the federal government should be spending more, not less, right now. He has laid out a bold second-term agenda in which deficit spending and higher taxes on top earners will finance what he calls “investments” in things like green energy and education.

But because he has a worse relationship with Congress than perhaps any president since Richard Nixon and seems to despise the kind of deal making that has been necessary for all of his predecessors, Obama is stuck with automatic spending cuts.

Obama couldn’t muster a deal on the debt limit in 2011, something George W. Bush accomplished with a Democratic congress and rock-bottom approval ratings, so the president devised and approved automatic reductions to automatic increases in spending. There is so little trust in the president among his foes that he had to build a dead-man switch into the deal to break the impasse.

Massive deficit spending, an ongoing absence of a budget and an inability to deal with Congress left Obama with little choice. But he believed that the cuts would be so odious that Congress would end up negating them.

But as we enter the age of sequestration, it turns out that cuts designed to be wretched are actually pretty popular.

Obama Democrats can take comfort in the fact that while voters generally agree that overall deficit reduction requires some tax increases in addition to spending cuts, but when it comes to the current debacle, the electorate is squarely against the president.

The latest Washington Post/ABC News poll shows 2-1 support for the spending reductions, and that’s not even limited to registered voters, a population that tends to be more fiscally conservative than the public at large.

[pullquote]

Worse for Obama, the poll shows strong support for letting the cuts fall on the president’s preferred domestic spending programs but shielding the military. The poll, which actually overstates the size of the reductions, shows the president is getting shellacked on spending.

But rather than bow to public opinion, the president means to change it by making Americans believe that shaving less than 3 percent off of federal spending will cause a government that employs some 2 million civilians and spends some $3.6 trillion a year to grind to a halt.

What he has succeeded in doing, though, is turning the “sequester” into a punchline.

Did you hear the one about the agency that released 2,000 inmates citing the “sequester” while ordering $50 million in new uniforms?

Voters had been hearing for weeks about flight delays, worker furloughs, laid off teachers, empty firehouses, tainted meat and unsecured borders. Between Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, voters had reason to believe that last week’s deadline would turn the United States into a less orderly version of Somalia.

But nothing happened. And the president had to admit as much last week when Republicans refused to cave in to Obama’s demands for another round of tax increases and let the ax fall.

The game, though, is still very much on.

As an internal email from the Agriculture Department shows, the intention is to maximize and expedite the pain from the cuts. An administrator, acting on what he said were orders from the top, told his subordinates not to find ways around the cuts but rather to let taxpayers feel the pain as promised.

The president, after weeks of attacking and denouncing his foes, is opening up the lines of communication with Senate Republicans. He is hoping that they will break with their House colleagues and yield on the cuts. If he can get the Senate GOP to do what they did on the suite of tax increases at the beginning of the year, Obama hopes that he can push spending back up.

Like a detective working over two suspects, Obama will offer the Senate Republicans one chance to turn on their confederates. Take the deal or everybody is going up the river together.

But what Obama has to offer in the way of a threat right now isn’t much. He is trying to make Republicans the villains from the cuts, but so far voters seem to think he’s blowing smoke.

By starting the scare tactics so early and so comically, the president has turned himself into the Keynesian who cried wolf. By the time the moment for an actual government shutdown arrives at the end of the month, Obama may not have much credibility left on the subject.

The White House closure is especially bad for the president. A guy being accused of selling access to the Oval Office to top donors doesn’t do well to tell Mr. and Mrs. America that they can’t bring their kids for a tour over spring break. A guy who takes Air Force One to play golf with Tiger Woods probably ought not muck up the vacation plans of ordinary folks.

He can blame Republicans and scream “sequester” all he wants, but Obama seems to be getting plenty of the blame for overseeing a failing federal government. Whether he can eventually punish taxpayers to the point that they side with him on cuts remains to be seen, but he is certainly paying a heavy price in the effort.

And Now, A Word From Charles



“[Hugo Chavez] spread the ideology to Bolivia, Ecuador and to Nicaragua. But in the end, those are basket cases, and with socialism, their system is not going to make it. It was Margaret Thatcher who said in the end socialism doesn't work because the socialists run out of other people's money. And there isn't a lot of it in Bolivia and Ecuador and Nicaragua to start with.”

(CNN) - There’s a deal! After a whirlwind couple of days of political jockeying, Senate leaders announced the final terms of a bipartisan compromise to reopen the government and raise the debt limit.

Here’s what you need to know:



Up to Speed

Wednesday afternoon. Senators are reading the proposal, and House Republicans and Democrats met separately to review it and consider next steps.

Both the Senate and the House are now expected to take it up on Wednesday evening, but it’s anyone’s guess when they might finish their work.

Live blog: Shutdown Day 16

President Barack Obama praised the Senate compromise and urged quick action in Congress with the government’s authority to raise money set to expire on Thursday.

The stock market responded positively, jumping by 200 points around noon before settling back a bit as Washington appeared to be pulling back from the fiscal brink. But businesses are blaming the Washington tumult for holding back hiring, according to a new survey.

The deal

The Senate deal would:

Reopen the government, funding it until January 15.

It also would raise the debt limit until February 7 to avert a possible default on U.S. debt obligations for the first time.

Also, the White House supports a provision in the deal that strengthens verification measures for people getting subsidies under Obamacare.

In addition, the Senate agreement would set up budget negotiations between the House and Senate for a long-term spending plan.

Cruz won't block vote in Senate - even though he opposes deal

What this means

But how would a Senate plan, which was quickly vocally rejected by House Republicans, pass the House? CNN’s John King explains: “If you get a scenario where the Senate sends over a plan and Speaker Boehner brings it to the floor and lets the full majority, 435 members of the House rule, most of the House Republicans can vote no.”

Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pennsylvania, said as much on Tuesday night on CNN.

“I believe that John Boehner will likely be in a position where he will have to essentially pass the bill that is negotiated between senators McConnell and Reid. And I believe the house would first pass it then send it to the senate,” Dent said.

Debt deadline decoded

Many Americans, unfortunately, live paycheck to paycheck. Now it looks like the United States of America is doing the same.

On Thursday, the nation’s treasurer runs out of his ability to confidently pay all our bills. An Obama administration official told CNN’s Brianna Keilar that the markets will remain calm as long as a resolution is nearing completion. But if there is still chaos...

That statement gives debt deniers more reason to doubt. Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, who said on CNN’s ‘New Day’ that it was a day simply “picked on a calendar.”

CNN’s Richard Quest responded to the debt deniers. “Why would you want to risk it?” Quest asked.

Quest also reminded people why the debt ceiling matters: “The United States is at the core of the global economy and the bond market is at the core of the core. U.S. Treasuries, U.S. debt is in every portfolio, pension fund, used by the banks to trade between each other. You are literally talking about the glue that is holding the financial world together.”

Meanwhile, ratings agency Fitch said that it may downgrade the country's AAA credit rating to AA+ over the political brinksmanship.

America’s Debt

On tap

10:00 a.m.: House is in session LIVE House in session

12:00 p.m.: Senate is in session

2:00 p.m.: Defense Secretary Leon Panetta talks about the debt limit

2:25 p.m.: President Obama meets with Treasury Secretary Jack Lew

By the Numbers

Moody’s economist Mark Zandi said the government shutdown has cost $20 billion so far. Here’s what that could have paid for:

2: weeks of unemployment insurance:

94: Percent of state national park requests

8: years of capital funding for airports

2: years of school lunch program

33: Percent of the country’s annual expenditure on food stamps

50: Percent of annual Pell Grants

392,000: Number of household salaries at the $51,017 median household income

Obamacare

Yep, it’s still the law. But for the first time the President addressed the website glitches. In an interview with KCCI, Obama said it “has had way more glitches than I think are acceptable and we've got people working around the clock to do that.”

Thus , unions wo n't be the unexpected winners of the fight , though the framework still upholds the Democrats ' principle that they will not offer unrequited concessions in exchange for Republicans agreeing to increase the debt limit .
Original post : If three months ago I had told you that the debt-limit fight would end not with Democrats offering a concession to Republicans but with Republicans teaming up with Democrats to provide a concession to dreaded labor unions , you would 've laughed me out of my job , and rightly so .
On Monday , congressional aides began leaking details of the framework Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell have settled upon to resolve the debt-limit crisis and reopen the government , which has been largely shuttered for two weeks .
The plan is tentative . McConnell will officially brief Senate Republicans on all of the details later this morning , and it 's possible they 'll demand changes . But realistically , time is up . McConnell spent much of Monday briefing his members about the negotiations in smaller groups , and if any of them are planning to stage a rebellion , they showed no signs of it yesterday . The shutdown has been absolutely devastating for Republicans as a national party , and two weeks into it their appetite for further battle is severely diminished .
The question the emerging deal poses is , How long will Republicans ' conciliatory spell last ? Or rather , how long will it take for them to heal and return to their nature ?
Reid and McConnell have conditionally agreed to fund the government through mid January -- before the second year of sequestration 's indiscriminate cuts begin savaging government agency budgets -- and to increase the debt limit until early February . Republicans might be ready to surrender now , but will they return to form early next year ? Will primary season make them fight more aggressively next time , or will their proximity to midterm elections suppress their tendencies .
Some Republicans -- hint , the ones with primary opponents -- will be under tremendous pressure not to cave again . But it 's unclear whether the new debt-limit deadline will be absolute , or whether the Treasury Department will be able to undertake `` extraordinary measures '' to delay the X-date , as they have through the past two debt-limit fights . That would probably push the deadline into spring , when some in-cycle members will be past their primaries , and eager to avoid damaging brinksmanship . But Republicans are somewhat puzzlingly proposing to prohibit Treasury from using those measures .
In either event , Democrats are effectively challenging Republicans to pick the same fight again next year , much closer to the election . They 're confident they 've either beaten the GOP into submission or will win all over again if Republicans choose to replay it .
Which brings us back to the unexpected conclusion of round one . How are unions the unexpected winners here ?
In addition to increasing the debt limit and reopening the government , the Reid-McConnell plan will also include a couple of sidecar provisions . Republicans will be able to say they did n't accept a literally clean debt-limit increase , but the provisions in question wo n't be policy concessions , or measures and trades Dems would have opposed outside the context of a default threat .
One of them is likely to be the delay of a fee on group health plans , which is intended to finance a temporary `` reinsurance '' fund -- a backstop for ACA insurers whose plans attract disproportionate numbers of older , sicker consumers . Here 's a helpful explainer from your good friends at Aetna . It 's unclear what 's going to happen to the fund itself . Insurers wo n't be happy if it gets delayed , because it 'll leave them vulnerable to adverse selection in Obamacare 's first year .
But unions have been demanding an exemption from the fee for months .
`` [ E ] ven though non-profit plans like ours won ’ t receive the same subsidies as for-profit plans , they ’ ll be taxed to pay for those subsidies , '' three key union leaders wrote in an unusually harsh letter to Reid and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi in July . Unions are actually demanding three Obamacare changes . Two of them , including their opposition to this fee , amount to requests for special treatment . Congressional Democrats have n't shown much interest in sticking their necks out to provide favors to unions so nakedly , and the Obama administration has declined to torture its interpretation of the law to grant union wishes administratively .
But in the context of the debt-limit fight , incentives change . Republicans need fig leaves to mask the extent to which they 've capitulated . Democrats can only agree to policy changes that they would support on neutral terms -- that Republicans are n't mugging them to get .
Delaying the fee meets both parties ' requirements . Dems get to give unions something they want , without backing a special carve-out , and Republicans get to delay an Obamacare tax . Strange bedfellows save the day .
At a superficial level , this appears to be a violation of President Obama 's pledge not to negotiate over the debt limit , and thus an invitation to Republicans to return for more ransom early next year . But I do n't think that analysis flies . Remember , Democrats have rejected repeated Republican attempts to delay a similarly sized tax on medical device manufacturers , even though many Democrats support repealing that tax on the merits . It might fall in future negotiations , but Democrats were unwilling to give it away to the GOP in exchange for simply increasing the debt limit .
President Obama 's principle is essentially that any policy ransom , no matter how small , is too large a price to pay for increasing the debt limit . Consensus items are fine . So are mutually agreeable swaps : Republicans could 've gotten the device tax repeal now if they 'd given up something themselves , but if Dems had given it to them for free , they 'd come back the next time asking for more .
The deal under consideration upholds that principle , despite the rhetorical ambiguity over the reinsurance fee delay . If it creates a precedent , it 's that Obama will reject all debt-limit demands , no matter how trivial , if he does n't support them independently or they 're not paired with counter concessions from the GOP . Republicans can spin away that they got an Obamacare scalp if it 'll help them manage internal politics , but they certainly wo n't leave this bruising fight with the expectation that they can get anything in exchange for increasing the debt limit that Obama would n't willingly part with .","Update, 9:30 a.m.: As of early Tuesday, sources now say Senate Democrats have agreed to drop the reinsurance fee delay from the debt limit framework because of GOP objections. Thus, unions won't be the unexpected winners of the fight, though the framework still upholds the Democrats' principle that they will not offer unrequited concessions in exchange for Republicans agreeing to increase the debt limit.

But here we are.

The question the emerging deal poses is, How long will Republicans' conciliatory spell last? Or rather, how long will it take for them to heal and return to their nature?

Reid and McConnell have conditionally agreed to fund the government through mid January -- before the second year of sequestration's indiscriminate cuts begin savaging government agency budgets -- and to increase the debt limit until early February. Republicans might be ready to surrender now, but will they return to form early next year? Will primary season make them fight more aggressively next time, or will their proximity to midterm elections suppress their tendencies.

Some Republicans -- hint, the ones with primary opponents -- will be under tremendous pressure not to cave again. But it's unclear whether the new debt-limit deadline will be absolute, or whether the Treasury Department will be able to undertake ""extraordinary measures"" to delay the X-date, as they have through the past two debt-limit fights. That would probably push the deadline into spring, when some in-cycle members will be past their primaries, and eager to avoid damaging brinksmanship. But Republicans are somewhat puzzlingly proposing to prohibit Treasury from using those measures.

In either event, Democrats are effectively challenging Republicans to pick the same fight again next year, much closer to the election. They're confident they've either beaten the GOP into submission or will win all over again if Republicans choose to replay it.

Which brings us back to the unexpected conclusion of round one. How are unions the unexpected winners here?

In addition to increasing the debt limit and reopening the government, the Reid-McConnell plan will also include a couple of sidecar provisions. Republicans will be able to say they didn't accept a literally clean debt-limit increase, but the provisions in question won't be policy concessions, or measures and trades Dems would have opposed outside the context of a default threat.

One of them is likely to be the delay of a fee on group health plans, which is intended to finance a temporary ""reinsurance"" fund -- a backstop for ACA insurers whose plans attract disproportionate numbers of older, sicker consumers. Here's a helpful explainer from your good friends at Aetna. It's unclear what's going to happen to the fund itself. Insurers won't be happy if it gets delayed, because it'll leave them vulnerable to adverse selection in Obamacare's first year.

But unions have been demanding an exemption from the fee for months.

""[E]ven though non-profit plans like ours won’t receive the same subsidies as for-profit plans, they’ll be taxed to pay for those subsidies,"" three key union leaders wrote in an unusually harsh letter to Reid and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi in July. Unions are actually demanding three Obamacare changes. Two of them, including their opposition to this fee, amount to requests for special treatment. Congressional Democrats haven't shown much interest in sticking their necks out to provide favors to unions so nakedly, and the Obama administration has declined to torture its interpretation of the law to grant union wishes administratively.

But in the context of the debt-limit fight, incentives change. Republicans need fig leaves to mask the extent to which they've capitulated. Democrats can only agree to policy changes that they would support on neutral terms -- that Republicans aren't mugging them to get.

Delaying the fee meets both parties' requirements. Dems get to give unions something they want, without backing a special carve-out, and Republicans get to delay an Obamacare tax. Strange bedfellows save the day.

At a superficial level, this appears to be a violation of President Obama's pledge not to negotiate over the debt limit, and thus an invitation to Republicans to return for more ransom early next year. But I don't think that analysis flies. Remember, Democrats have rejected repeated Republican attempts to delay a similarly sized tax on medical device manufacturers, even though many Democrats support repealing that tax on the merits. It might fall in future negotiations, but Democrats were unwilling to give it away to the GOP in exchange for simply increasing the debt limit.

President Obama's principle is essentially that any policy ransom, no matter how small, is too large a price to pay for increasing the debt limit. Consensus items are fine. So are mutually agreeable swaps: Republicans could've gotten the device tax repeal now if they'd given up something themselves, but if Dems had given it to them for free, they'd come back the next time asking for more.

The deal under consideration upholds that principle, despite the rhetorical ambiguity over the reinsurance fee delay. If it creates a precedent, it's that Obama will reject all debt-limit demands, no matter how trivial, if he doesn't support them independently or they're not paired with counter concessions from the GOP. Republicans can spin away that they got an Obamacare scalp if it'll help them manage internal politics, but they certainly won't leave this bruising fight with the expectation that they can get anything in exchange for increasing the debt limit that Obama wouldn't willingly part with.

And that was what Obama really wanted.",www.salon.com,left,rIiXyKIzesXBfdly

The House Republican budget will balance in 10 years by increasing oil drilling, repealing President Barack Obama’s health care law, changing Medicare, overhauling welfare and rewriting the tax code.

The framework won’t be unveiled until Tuesday, but House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) peeled back the curtain Monday night in a Wall Street Journal op-ed.

Ryan writes that “the government spends no more than it collects in revenue” under the GOP plan.

“Our opponents will shout austerity, but let’s put this in perspective,” Ryan writes. “On the current path, we’ll spend $46 trillion over the next 10 years. Under our proposal, we’ll spend $41 trillion. On the current path, spending will increase by 5 percent each year. Under our proposal, it will increase by 3.4 percent. Because the U.S. economy will grow faster than spending, the budget will balance by 2023, and debt held by the public will drop to just over half the size of the economy.”

The op-ed shows that the budget won’t be a bundle of new surprises. Tax reform, Ryan says, will close loopholes and collapse the complex tax code to two brackets: 10 percent and 25 percent.

That’s coming up quickly, moving debate over this Congress-imposed cap on the national debt onto the legislative calendar right alongside a parallel debate in Congress about approving a budget for the new fiscal year that starts Oct. 1.

Right now, Republicans and Democrats appear light-years apart. Many conservative lawmakers are pushing to link a hike in the debt limit with plans for new spending cuts.

President Obama says raising the borrowing cap is simply a matter of allowing already-approved federal spending to occur – not something that should become a bargaining chip in budget talks.

What if Republicans and Democrats can’t agree on a debt-limit hike?

According to Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, the government would run up against the current ceiling – a national debt of $16.7 trillion.

The economic implications are large.

Failure to raise the debt ceiling could throw the US government into a position of being unable to meet its financial obligations – a position that many investors would view as a debt default. It could prompt a credit-rating downgrade. It would affect millions of Americans as routine payments for things like military salaries or Medicare stalled or slowed.

And beyond that, a debt-limit impasse could slow an already tepid economic recovery by damaging the confidence of businesses, investors, and consumers.

Some of this is known because we’ve seen the movie before.

The last time the US ran up to the borrowing limit was in 2011. Congress raised the cap, but only after going so close to the brink of default that Standard & Poor's downgraded the government's debt.

The stock market showed significant jitters, and consumer confidence took a big hit.

That was all without any actual failure to raise the cap.

A debt downgrade, in effect, makes Treasury borrowing more expensive because investors view government bonds as riskier. And in the 2011 case, the doubts were about political will of a divided Congress, not about fundamental capacity of the US economy to fund government debts.

This time around, as last time, many Republicans in Congress view the debt limit as a bargaining chip. At a time when the national debt is already sky high, they argue, the cap should be raised only in tandem with significant moves toward future fiscal discipline.

House Speaker John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican , said the “ principle is simple : no budget , no pay . ”
“ Before there is any long-term debt limit increase , a budget should be passed that cuts spending , ” Mr. Boehner said in his closing remarks at the posh Kingsmill Resort near Colonial Williamsburg .

The Democratic Senate has not passed a budget in almost four years , which is unfair to hard-working taxpayers who expect more from their representatives . ”
The White House gave a cautious welcome to the suggestion the House Republicans were open to a delay in the expected showdown over raising the federal debt limit , but said the offer fell far short of the president ’ s position on a long-term budget and spending deal .
“ We are encouraged that there are signs that congressional Republicans may back off their insistence on holding our economy hostage to extract drastic cuts in Medicare , education and programs middle-class families depend on , ” said White House spokesman Jay Carney in a statement Friday afternoon .
“ Congress must pay its bills and pass a clean debt limit increase without further delay , ” Mr. Carney said . “ And as he has said , the president remains committed to further reducing the deficit in a balanced way . ”
Bu Mr. Boehner ’ s move will ramp up the political pressure on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to pass a budget through the upper chamber for the first time since 2009 .
Mr. Reid , Nevada Democrat , has been reluctant to force some of the more vulnerable Democrats to cast votes on spending plans that could come back to haunt them at the polls .
Over that same four-year period , the national debt has mushroomed and the nation has run four straight $ 1 trillion-plus deficits .
The House GOP spent a good chunk of time during its retreat mapping out a path forward on raising the nation ’ s $ 16.4 trillion debt limit , which is expected to breached as early as mid-February .
Lawmakers also are weighing how best to deal with the looming $ 110 billion in across-the-board spending cuts , known as budget sequesters , set to kick in March 1 and the stopgap spending bill that has kept the government funded since September and is scheduled to run out on March 27 .
President Obama and Democrats meanwhile , have balked at the idea of attaching any strings to a debt limit hike , warning that failure to raise the federal borrowing limit would jeopardize the economy and global markets .
House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan , the party ’ s 2012 vice presidential nominee , told reporters on Thursday that a short-term extension of the debt limit was one of the ideas that Republicans are weighing — though even that move must be in exchange for Democrats ceding ground on spending or other budget reforms .
“ We think it is incredible that the Senate for three years has ignored the law and refused to pass the budget , ” he said . “ We think we need to have a big debate about a vision for the country and at least how we would budget . ”","WILLIAMSBURG, VA. — Capping a three-day GOP retreat, House GOP leaders announced that next week they will pursue a three-month extension of the nation’s borrowing limit to give Congress more time to pass a federal budget — warning that the proposal will also freeze members’ pay if they fail to do their job.

“Congress must pay its bills and pass a clean debt limit increase without further delay,” Mr. Carney said. “And as he has said, the president remains committed to further reducing the deficit in a balanced way.”

Bu Mr. Boehner’s move will ramp up the political pressure on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to pass a budget through the upper chamber for the first time since 2009.

Mr. Reid, Nevada Democrat, has been reluctant to force some of the more vulnerable Democrats to cast votes on spending plans that could come back to haunt them at the polls.

Over that same four-year period, the national debt has mushroomed and the nation has run four straight $1 trillion-plus deficits.

The House GOP spent a good chunk of time during its retreat mapping out a path forward on raising the nation’s $16.4 trillion debt limit, which is expected to breached as early as mid-February.

Lawmakers also are weighing how best to deal with the looming $110 billion in across-the-board spending cuts, known as budget sequesters, set to kick in March 1 and the stopgap spending bill that has kept the government funded since September and is scheduled to run out on March 27.

President Obama and Democrats meanwhile, have balked at the idea of attaching any strings to a debt limit hike, warning that failure to raise the federal borrowing limit would jeopardize the economy and global markets.

House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, the party’s 2012 vice presidential nominee, told reporters on Thursday that a short-term extension of the debt limit was one of the ideas that Republicans are weighing — though even that move must be in exchange for Democrats ceding ground on spending or other budget reforms.

“We think it is incredible that the Senate for three years has ignored the law and refused to pass the budget,” he said. “We think we need to have a big debate about a vision for the country and at least how we would budget.”
