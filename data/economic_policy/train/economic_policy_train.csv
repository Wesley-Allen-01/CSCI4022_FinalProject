Is a recession coming to the US? Here’s what to watch for

It’s 10 years since the great recession and by many measures the US economy is still booming. Unemployment is at lows last seen 50 years ago, stock markets, while wobbly, are close to record highs, consumer confidence is high and shoppers keep shopping. And yet there is a shadow over America.

A chorus of economists are warning that the chances of a recession are growing. The Trump administration’s trade war with China is taking its toll abroad and there are now signs it’s coming home. This week #TrumpRecession started trending on Twitter as US stock markets suffered their worst day of the year.

Donald Trump pledged to bring back manufacturing jobs and end “unfair” trade relationships with the US’s biggest trading partners. Though economists have long argued over how much control a president really has over the economy, this one can move the markets with a tweet. And while Trump has enjoyed the fruits of this long-running economic boom his policies are also inextricably tied to the issues now rattling investors.

This week’s market sell off came after a keenly watched economic indicator, the yield curve, started flashing warning lights. Could the longest economic expansion in US history be finally heading for recession?

Here are the areas you need to keep an eye on:

Yield curve

Every recession of the last 60 years has been preceded by an inverted yield curve. The term is off-puttingly wonky but it just means investors see trouble ahead.

US treasury bonds are regarded as safe investments. Usually investors expect higher returns for tying their money up in long-term bonds than they do for short-term bonds. When long-term bonds offer lower interest rates than short-term ones, the yield curve has inverted.

This week yields on the 10-year treasuries fell below two-year yields for the first time since 2007. Looking at yield curves, the New York Fed now puts the probability of a recession by July 2020 at 31.5%– close to one in three.

There’s some argument that the oracular power of inversions ain’t what it used to be thanks to the aggressive monetary policies that have been pursued by central banks around the world.

But Gus Faucher, PNC bank’s chief economist, still sees inverted yields as “a very reliable indicator”. Faucher is betting on a slowdown rather than a recession next year but either way he argues inverted yield curves are bad news.

Verdict: Negative sign

Jobs

“JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! #MAGA” Trump tweeted last month, sharing a graph that showed gains in employment across a broad swath of industries from professional services to mining.



The US has now added jobs for 106 months in a row, the longest streak on record. The unemployment rate, at 3.7%, is close to its lowest recorded level, 3.6% in 1969. There is no sign of a pickup in claims for unemployment benefits.

The pace of jobs growth is slowing, however. Employers added 165,000 jobs a month, on average, over the first seven months of the year, down from an average of 223,000 a month in 2018. And wages – which have lagged behind employment growth ever since the end of the recession – are still growing slowly, up just 3.2% in July from a year ago.

In a recent note Capital Economics pointed out that every recession in the past 50 years was marked by a significant rise in jobless claims that began slightly before, or at the time, that recession began. “With claims still close to a 50-year low, it would be highly unusual if the economy was already in recession (or anywhere near it) right now,” wrote chief US economist Paul Ashworth.

Verdict: Positive sign

Stock markets

“The periods of boredom have grown shorter and shorter – and the terrors last a bit longer,” said Arthur Cashin, director of floor operations for UBS Financial Services at the New York Stock Exchange.

US stock markets hit another record high last month but the daily swings in share prices are giving investors motion sickness. The Dow lost 800 points (3%) on Wednesday, its worst performance of the year, rattled by the inverted yield curve and fears that the trade war with China would escalate.

But the S&P 500 is up close to 26% since Trump took office (it rose 175.9% under Obama, albeit from a crushing low) and has continued to rise as investors have looked for ways to make money in a low interest rate environment.

As indicators go, stock market falls don’t have a great track record of predicting recessions. Markets dropped before the 2001 recession and at the start of the 2008 recession but, according to an analysis by Ben Carlson, a portfolio manager at Ritholtz Wealth Management, most recessions are not preceded by stock market falls. “We’ll have a recession at some point but odds are the stock market won’t tip us off ahead of time,” writes Carlson.

Verdict: worrying but not predictive sign

Gross Domestic Product

It takes two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth to make a recession. The US, the world’s largest economy, accounts for about a quarter of global gross domestic product (GDP) – the broadest measure of economic health. Last quarter, US GDP slowed to 2.1%, down from 3.1% in the first three months of the year and well below the 2018’s 2.9% growth. Meh, but still positive.

The major headwind for slowing growth in the US is Trump’s signature economic policy: trade wars. Trump has started spats with all of the US’s largest trading partners.

The dispute with China, the world’s second largest economy, worries economists the most. In July industrial output growth dropped to a more than 17-year low in China and that was before a new round of tariffs were announced by Trump. The latest levies have been delayed – to spare Christmas shoppers – but they are still coming. This month Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius warned: “Fears that the trade war will trigger a recession are growing.”

Meanwhile in Europe Germany is suffering as the US and China go head to head. Growth slowed to 0.1% in the three months to the end of June. Brexit is taking its toll , not least in the UK where the government has announced the first fall in quarterly GDP in six and a half years.

Exports of goods and services from the US account for about 12% of US GDP, consumer spending, which remains robust, accounts for close to 68%. The US has so far weathered Trump’s trade tirade, but how long will that continue as goods increase in price and the economies of its trading partners weaken? The second quarter US GDP figures will be revised at the end of the month and the third quarter figure will be released in November. They will be the next big measure of whether, or not, the US boom is turning to bust and the Fed is already predicting another slowdown.

He spoke with Daniel Gross about The Great Deformation.

It disables the Republicans, who are supposed to be the conservative party, on fiscal policy.

Did you discover any other heroes?

You have to go back to Carter Glass, a Democratic senator from Virginia. He was chairman of the banking committee in 1913, father of the Federal Reserve Act, and one of the co-authors of the Glass-Steagall Act. He was a self-taught but brilliant student of money. The Fed was meant to be a bankers’ bank.

I don’t hold it against someone who makes a killing. I’m saying this kind of start-stop, boom-bust monetary policy is pointless, and it’s one of the mechanisms by which windfalls are shifted to the 1 percent.

You’re still nominally a Republican. But you have some pretty harsh words for Mitt Romney, the party’s nominee for president last year.

I call the chapter “Willard M. Romney and the Truman Show of Bubble Finance.” Remember that movie? Truman didn’t know he was in an artificial world. The same holds for many private-equity people. We had a massive bubble of historic proportions. The wealth they created wasn’t due to building a new mousetrap, or a superior form of management. It was due to manic finance.

Don’t you take any heat from America’s comparative outperformance in recent years? Our economy is growing, our banks have stopped failing, the deficit is falling. It seems like our policies are working a lot better than, say, Europe’s.

I’m not trying to assess comparative performance. But I am suggesting that the short-run bounce that we’ve had is not sustainable. When the Federal Reserve has to stop buying bonds, what is going to happen to the bond markets and interest rates? The efforts to reduce the short-term deficit aren’t going to make our long-term debt problem better. You have to look at the trend, not just the economic report from the last quarter. The stock market is now where it was 13 years ago. And what’s happened in the past 13 years? Only 2 million jobs created, 17,000 per month, when we’ve needed 150,000. We’re so far gone.

So what is to be done?

Only radical surgery can save us. We need constitutional amendments for term limits, to abolish incumbency, to abolish private money in campaigns. We have to overturn Citizens United and shorten the campaign season. I also suggest a balanced-budget amendment. The Federal Reserve should just go back to just being a bankers’ bank.

But the entities that benefit from the financial system have so much power and wealth that it seems like getting even a tiny fraction of the changes you’re pushing would be difficult. How does your agenda pass in the face of their opposition?

Our goal was to slash rates , shrink the IRS , create jobs , grow wages , and empower parents all at the same time . Since offering these ideas , I have gathered input from Americans of all economic backgrounds and engaged in discussions with leaders across the conservative movement to form a complete , pro-growth , pro-family tax reform agenda for the 21st century .
My plan is a significant departure from the old school tax reform ideas that so often come out of Washington . First , on the individual side , my plan reduces the number of brackets from seven to three : 15 % , 25 % , and 35 % . The plan eliminates all exemptions and deductions , except for a charitable contribution deduction and a reformed home mortgage interest deduction . Taxpayers will instead receive a personal tax credit that phases out for higher-income Americans . This greatly simplified code will cut taxes for the vast majority of people .
Second , my plan cuts rates for all businesses – large and small – to no higher than 25 % , which would finally make us competitive again with the rest of the developed world . My plan recognizes that big businesses shouldn ’ t get a larger tax cut than small businesses , which are the main drivers of economic growth . To further spur job creation , I will end federal taxation of business investment by allowing for immediate expensing . I will also shift to a territorial tax system , thus ending the double-taxation of profits earned abroad for both businesses and individuals .
Furthermore , my plan eliminates the double-taxation on saving and investment income . It provides a transition period during which we will move to a 0 % tax rate on dividends and capital gains , which is a forward-looking way to benefit millions of everyday savers across all income levels . My plan also eliminates the death tax , finally putting an end to one of the IRS 's most insulting practices .

Our goal was to slash rates, shrink the IRS, create jobs, grow wages, and empower parents all at the same time. Since offering these ideas, I have gathered input from Americans of all economic backgrounds and engaged in discussions with leaders across the conservative movement to form a complete, pro-growth, pro-family tax reform agenda for the 21st century.

My plan is a significant departure from the old school tax reform ideas that so often come out of Washington. First, on the individual side, my plan reduces the number of brackets from seven to three: 15%, 25%, and 35%. The plan eliminates all exemptions and deductions, except for a charitable contribution deduction and a reformed home mortgage interest deduction. Taxpayers will instead receive a personal tax credit that phases out for higher-income Americans. This greatly simplified code will cut taxes for the vast majority of people.

Second, my plan cuts rates for all businesses – large and small – to no higher than 25%, which would finally make us competitive again with the rest of the developed world. My plan recognizes that big businesses shouldn’t get a larger tax cut than small businesses, which are the main drivers of economic growth. To further spur job creation, I will end federal taxation of business investment by allowing for immediate expensing. I will also shift to a territorial tax system, thus ending the double-taxation of profits earned abroad for both businesses and individuals.

Furthermore, my plan eliminates the double-taxation on saving and investment income. It provides a transition period during which we will move to a 0% tax rate on dividends and capital gains, which is a forward-looking way to benefit millions of everyday savers across all income levels. My plan also eliminates the death tax, finally putting an end to one of the IRS's most insulting practices.

While some well-respected voices oppose this tax relief, I remain adamant that empowering struggling families should be a priority for any modern reform plan.

Today, of course, is New Years Day. For a lot of folks, it's a day of renewal and recommitment, of looking forward to the coming year and resolving to do things better. With that hope comes hard work: namely, looking over the previous year and reckoning with the mistakes you made and what you can learn from them.

What's true of individuals is also true of governments, leadership, and economic policymakers.

Granted, 2019 was not the most dramatic year of the past decade. Wages, growth, and livelihoods are not doing as well as some headline figures suggest, but they're doing much better now than they were at the start of the 2010s.

Still, in the world of business and economics, some big stuff did happen in 2019, which shed light on assumptions and policies and ways of doing things that need to change. If we want 2020 to be better, here are some lessons everyone should heed:

1. We have no idea where full employment is.

In macroeconomic policymaking, few questions are more central than how hot we can run the economy. This question looms particularly large for the Federal Reserve, which adjusts interest rates to strike the balance between stable prices and maximum employment. To that end, the Fed began hiking interest rates in 2016, despite the fact that inflation was nowhere in sight. The fear was that if the central bank didn't anticipate inflation, it would be too late to control once it took off. Yet unemployment just kept falling, and prices haven't so much as twitched. Meanwhile, other metrics suggest the economy is a lot further from full capacity than policymakers believed.

In January 2019, the Fed cried uncle and began cutting rates again — an almost unprecedented decision, given the state of the economy. It was a tacit admission of the obvious: No one has any idea where full capacity actually lies. All our predictions have been bunk. ""We can sustain much lower levels of unemployment than had been thought,"" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said recently. ""To call it hot, you'd want to see heat.""

2. Lots of rich geniuses aren't all that smart.

Initially regarded as something between an entrepreneurial genius and a new age guru, Adam Neumann was the CEO of WeWork. He convinced Masayoshi Son, a freewheeling Japanese investor, to sink $9 billion into the venture, and WeWork was headed for a $47 billion valuation. But WeWork's basic rent-a-workspace business model, while perfectly reasonable, made no sense as a $47 billion innovation. In 2019, investors caught on, the IPO fell apart, and Neumann was pushed out as CEO.

It was a particularly dramatic example of how a lot of Silicon Valley wonder companies are fads and regulatory arbitrages, run by mediocrities. It also showed how business leaders often warp corporate governance to turn companies into their own personal ATMs — investors had to pay the former CEO $1 billion just to make him go away. The next time someone says we need billionaires because they’re experts at productively directing economic activity, remind them of Neumann.

3. Private businesses aren't good at self-policing.

Closely related to the idea that we need billionaires is another line of thought: that government is inefficient, and the best government is that which governs least. One consequence of this philosophy has been a hollowing out of congressional staff and institutional expertise, leaving government effectively unable to think for itself. Legislating and regulating have increasingly been taken over by lobbyists and private business powers.

One particular example of this was a 2003 decision by Congress to have the Federal Aviation Administration allow employees at aerospace companies to essentially conduct much of the agency's oversight for it. This practice came back to bite everyone in 2019. Pressed for time and profits, Boeing slapped together its new 737 Max with an inadequate design and jury-rigged software. The result was two crashes, which killed 346 people. The plane was grounded in March 2019. As of now, Boeing's CEO is toast, recriminations are flying within the FAA and Congress, and no one has any idea when or if the 737 Max will fly again.

4. The Trump administration's economic policy still isn't working.

The GOP's tax cuts may have passed back in 2017, but it's worth keeping continued tabs on the results, given the enthusiasm with which many policymakers insist that giving rich people ever bigger profits is the best way to grow jobs and wages. In 2019, the tax cuts continued to be a complete dud: no discernible effect on business investment, on wages, or on employment.

The same goes for Trump's trade war. Granted, the president is right to denounce the global trade order as a mess. But his tit-for-tat tariffs have proven to be a feeble and confused strategy, doing as much harm as good for America's economic prospects. The wins in the new North American trade deal look modest at best. Trump's critics may err in blaming everything wrong in the economy on the tariffs. But the best that can be said of Trump's trade war is it has accomplished nothing of significance.

5. The minimum wage, however, is working.

Mainstream economics has long considered the minimum wage to be a job killer. But over the last decade or so, a building literature has challenged that consensus. Experts in the field delivered several big syntheses of this new research in 2019, demonstrating that minimum wage hikes generally have no significant effect on employment. There are multiple reasons for this, ranging from the new spending that enters the economy due to higher wages, higher labor costs forcing businesses to be more productive, and how monopsony power in labor markets can allow businesses to artificially depress worker pay.

This year's studies were particularly noteworthy because they covered previous natural experiments in minimum wage hikes that were as aggressive as the $15-an-hour minimum wages U.S. states and cities are currently passing. The point isn't infinitely elastic, of course: At some high-enough level, minimum wages will become destructive on net.

While there were major political differences between the totalitarian rule of the Soviets and the democratic politics of Israel , India , and the U.K. , all three of the latter countries adhered to socialist principles , nationalizing their major industries and placing economic decision-making in the hands of the government .
The Soviet failure has been well documented by historians . In 1985 , General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev took command of a bankrupt disintegrating empire . After 70 years of Marxism , Soviet farms were unable to feed the people , factories failed to meet their quotas , people lined up for blocks in Moscow and other cities to buy bread and other necessities , and a war in Afghanistan dragged on with no end in sight of the body bags of young Soviet soldiers .
The economies of the Communist nations behind the Iron Curtain were similarly enfeebled because they functioned in large measure as colonies of the Soviet Union . With no incentives to compete or modernize , the industrial sector of Eastern and Central Europe became a monument to bureaucratic inefficiency and waste , a “ museum of the early industrial age. ” As the New York Times pointed out at the time , Singapore , an Asian city-state of only 2 million people , exported 20 percent more machinery to the West in 1987 than all of Eastern Europe .
And yet , socialism still beguiled leading intellectuals and politicians of the West . They could not resist its siren song , of a world without strife because it was a world without private property . They were convinced that a bureaucracy could make more-informed decisions about the welfare of a people than the people themselves could . They believed , with John Maynard Keynes , that “ the state is wise and the market is stupid . ”
Israel , India , and the United Kingdom all adopted socialism as an economic model following World War II . The preamble to India ’ s constitution , for example , begins , “ We , the People of India , having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic . . . ” The original settlers of Israel were East European Jews of the Left who sought and built a socialist society . As soon as the guns of World War II fell silent , Britain ’ s Labour Party nationalized every major industry and acceded to every socialist demand of the unions .
At first , socialism seemed to work in these vastly dissimilar countries . For the first two decades of its existence , Israel ’ s economy grew at an annual rate of more than 10 percent , leading many to term Israel an “ economic miracle. ” The average GDP growth rate of India from its founding in 1947 into the 1970s was 3.5 percent , placing India among the more prosperous developing nations . GDP growth in Great Britain averaged 3 percent from 1950 to 1965 , along with a 40 percent rise in average real wages , enabling Britain to become one of the world ’ s more affluent countries .
But the government planners were unable to keep pace with increasing population and overseas competition . After decades of ever declining economic growth and ever rising unemployment , all three countries abandoned socialism and turned toward capitalism and the free market . The resulting prosperity in Israel , India , and the U.K. vindicated free-marketers who had predicted that socialism would inevitably fail to deliver the goods . As British prime minister Margaret Thatcher observed , “ the problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people ’ s money . ”
Israel is unique , the only nation where socialism was successful — for a while . The original settlers , according to Israeli professor Avi Kay , “ sought to create an economy in which market forces were controlled for the benefit of the whole society. ” Driven by a desire to leave behind their history as victims of penury and prejudice , they sought an egalitarian , labor-oriented socialist society . The initial , homogeneous population of less than 1 million drew up centralized plans to convert the desert into green pastures and build efficient state-run companies .
Most early settlers , American Enterprise Institute scholar Joseph Light pointed out , worked either on collective farms called kibbutzim or in state-guaranteed jobs . The kibbutzim were small farming communities in which people did chores in exchange for food and money to live on and pay their bills . There was no private property , people ate in common , and children under 18 lived together and not with their parents . Any money earned on the outside was given to the kibbutz .
A key player in the socialization of Israel was the Histadrut , the General Federation of Labor , subscribers to the socialist dogma that capital exploits labor and that the only way to prevent such “ robbery ” is to grant control of the means of production to the state . As it proceeded to unionize almost all workers , the Histadrut gained control of nearly every economic and social sector , including the kibbutzim , housing , transportation , banks , social welfare , health care , and education . The federation ’ s political instrument was the Labor party , which effectively ruled Israel from the founding of Israel in 1948 until 1973 and the Yom Kippur War . In the early years , few asked whether any limits should be placed on the role of government .
Israel ’ s economic performance seemed to confirm Keynes ’ s judgment . Real GDP growth from 1955 to 1975 was an astounding 12.6 percent , putting Israel among the fastest-growing economies in the world , with one of the lowest income differentials . However , this rapid growth was accompanied by rising levels of private consumption and , over time , increasing income inequality . There was an increasing demand for economic reform to free the economy from the government ’ s centralized decision-making . In 1961 , supporters of economic liberalization formed the Liberal party — the first political movement committed to a market economy .
The Israeli “ economic miracle ” evaporated in 1965 when the country suffered its first major recession . Economic growth halted and unemployment rose threefold from 1965 to 1967 . Before the government could attempt corrective action , the Six-Day War erupted , altering Israel ’ s economic and political map . Paradoxically , the war brought short-lived prosperity to Israel , owing to increased military spending and a major influx of workers from new territories . But government-led economic growth was accompanied by accelerating inflation , reaching an annual rate of 17 percent from 1971 to 1973 .
For the first time , there was a public debate between supporters of free-enterprise economics and supporters of traditional socialist arrangements . Leading the way for the free market was the future Nobel Prize winner Milton Friedman , who urged Israeli policymakers to “ set your people free ” and liberalize the economy . The 1973 war and its economic impacts reinforced the feelings of many Israelis that the Labor party ’ s socialist model could not handle the country ’ s growing economic challenges . The 1977 elections resulted in the victory of the Likud party , with its staunch pro-free-market philosophy . The Likud took as one of its coalition partners the Liberal party .
Because socialism ’ s roots in Israel were so deep , real reform proceeded slowly . Friedman was asked to draw up a program that would move Israel from socialism toward a free-market economy . His major reforms included fewer government programs and reduced government spending ; less government intervention in fiscal , trade , and labor policies ; income-tax cuts ; and privatization . A great debate ensued between government officials seeking reform and special interests that preferred the status quo .
Meanwhile , the government kept borrowing and spending and driving up inflation , which averaged 77 percent for 1978–79 and reached a peak of 450 percent in 1984–85 . The government ’ s share of the economy grew to 76 percent , while fiscal deficits and national debt skyrocketed . The government printed money through loans from the Bank of Israel , which contributed to the inflation by churning out money .
Finally , in January 1983 , the bubble burst , and thousands of private citizens and businesses as well as government-run enterprises faced bankruptcy . Israel was close to collapse . At this critical moment , a sympathetic U.S. president , Ronald Reagan , and his secretary of state , George Shultz , came to the rescue . They offered a grant of $ 1.5 billion if the Israeli government agreed to abandon its socialist rulebook and adopt some form of U.S.-style capitalism , using American-trained professionals .
The Histadrut strongly resisted , unwilling to give up their decades-old power and to concede that socialism was responsible for Israel ’ s economic troubles . However , the people had had enough of soaring inflation and non-existent growth and rejected the Histadrut ’ s policy of resistance . Still , the Israeli government hesitated , unwilling to spend political capital on economic reform . An exasperated Secretary Schulz informed Israel that if it did not begin freeing up the economy , the U.S. would freeze “ all monetary transfers ” to the country . The threat worked . The Israeli government officially adopted most of the free-market “ recommendations . ”
The impact of a basic shift in Israeli economic policy was immediate and pervasive . Within a year , inflation tumbled from 450 percent to just 20 percent , a budget deficit of 15 percent of GDP shrank to zero , the Histadrut ’ s economic and business empire disappeared along with its political domination , and the Israeli economy was opened to imports . Of particular importance was the Israeli high-tech revolution , which led to a 600 percent increase in investment in Israel , transforming the country into a major player in the high-tech world .
There were troubling side effects such as social gaps , poverty , and concerns about social justice , but the socialist rhetoric and ideology , according to Glenn Frankel , the Washington Post ’ s correspondent in Israel , “ has been permanently retired. ” The socialist Labor party endorsed privatization and the divestment of many publicly held companies that had become corrupted by featherbedding , rigid work rules , phony bookkeeping , favoritism , and incompetent managers .
After modest expansion in the 1990s , Israel ’ s economic growth topped the charts in the developing world in the 2000s , propelled by low inflation and a reduction in the size of government . Unemployment was still too high and taxes took up 40 percent of GDP , much of it caused by the need for a large military . However , political parties are agreed that there is no turning back to the economic policies of the early years — the debate is about the rate of further market reform . “ The world ’ s most successful experiment in socialism , ” Light wrote , “ appears to have resolutely embraced capitalism . ”
Acceptance of socialism was strong in India long before independence , spurred by widespread resentment against British colonialism and the land-owning princely class ( the zamindars ) and by the efforts of the Communist Party of India , established in 1921 . Jawaharlal Nehru adopted socialism as the ruling ideology when he became India ’ s first prime minister after independence in 1947 .
For nearly 30 years , the Indian government adhered to a socialist line , restricting imports , prohibiting foreign direct investment , protecting small companies from competition from large corporations , and maintaining price controls on a wide variety of industries including steel , cement , fertilizers , petroleum , and pharmaceuticals . Any producer who exceeded their licensed capacity faced possible imprisonment .
As the Indian economist Swaminathan S. Anklesaria Aiyar wrote , “ India was perhaps the only country in the world where improving productivity . . . was a crime. ” It was a strict application of the socialist principle that the market can not be trusted to produce good economic or social outcomes . Economic inequality was regulated through taxes — the top personal income tax rate hit a stifling 97.75 percent .
Some 14 public banks were nationalized in 1969 ; six more banks were taken over by the government in 1980 . Driven by the principle of “ self-reliance , ” almost anything that could be produced domestically could not be imported regardless of the cost . It was the “ zenith ” of Indian socialism , which still failed to satisfy the basic needs of an ever expanding population . In 1977–78 , more than half of India was living below the poverty line .
At the same time , notes Indian-American economist Arvind Panagariya , a series of external shocks shook the country , including a war with Pakistan in 1965 , which came on the heels of a war with China in 1962 ; another war with Pakistan in 1971 ; consecutive droughts in 1971–72 and 1972–73 , and the oil price crisis of October 1973 , which contributed to a 40 percent deterioration in India ’ s foreign trade .
Economic performance from 1965 to 1981 was worse than than at any other time of the post-independence period . As in Israel , economic reform became an imperative . Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had pushed her policy agenda as far to the left as possible . In 1980 , the Congress party won a two-thirds majority in the Parliament , and Gandhi adopted , at last , a more pragmatic , non-ideological course . But as with everything else in India , economic reform proceeded slowly .
An industrial-policy statement continued the piecemeal retreat from socialism that had begun in 1975 , allowing companies to expand their capacity , encouraging investment in a wide variety of industries , and introducing private-sector participation in telecommunications . Further liberalization received a major boost under Rajiv Gandhi , who succeeded his mother in 1984 following her assassination . As a result , GDP growth reached an encouraging 5.5 percent .
Economics continued to trump ideology under Rajiv Gandhi , who was free of the socialist baggage carried by an earlier generation . His successor , P. V. Narasimha Rao , put an end to licensing except in selected sectors and opened the door to much wider foreign investment . Finance minister Manmohan Singh cut the tariff rates from an astronomical 355 percent to 65 percent . According to Arvind Panagariya , “ the government had introduced enough liberalizing measures to set the economy on the course to sustaining approximately 6 percent growth on a long-term basis. ” In fact , India ’ s GDP growth reached a peak of over 9 percent in 2005–8 , followed by a dip to just under 7 percent in 2017–18 .
A major development of the economic reforms was the remarkable expansion of India ’ s middle class . The Economist estimates there are 78 million Indians in the middle-middle and upper middle-class category . By including the lower middle class , Indian economists Krishnan and Hatekar figure that India ’ s new middle class grew from 304.2 million in 2004–5 to an amazing 606.3 million in 2011–12 , almost one-half of the entire Indian population . The daily income of the three middle classes are lower middle , $ 2– $ 4 ; middle middle , $ 4– $ 6 ; upper middle , $ 6– $ 10 .
While this is extremely low by U.S. standards , a dollar goes a long way in India , where the annual per capita income is approximately $ 6,500 . If only half of the lower middle class makes the transition to upper-class or middle income , that would mean an Indian middle class of about 350 million Indians — a mid-point between The Economist and Krishnan and Hatekar estimates . Such an enormous middle class confirms the judgment of the Heritage Foundation , in its Index of Economic Freedom , that India is developing into an “ open-market economy . ”
In 2017 , India overtook Germany to become the fourth-largest auto market in the world , and it is expected to displace Japan in 2020 . That same year , India overtook the U.S. in smartphone sales to become the second-largest smartphone market in the world . Usually described as an agricultural country , India is today 31 percent urbanized . With an annual GDP of $ 8.7 trillion , India ranks fifth in the world , behind the United States , China , Japan , and Great Britain . Never before in recorded history , Indian economist Gurcharan Das has noted , have so many people risen so quickly .
All this has been accomplished because the political leaders of India sought and adopted a better economic system — free enterprise — after some four decades of fitful progress and unequal prosperity under socialism .
Widely described as “ the sick man of Europe ” after three decades of socialism , the United Kingdom underwent an economic revolution in the 1970s and 1980s because of one remarkable person — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher . Some skeptics doubted that she could pull it off — the U.K. was then a mere shadow of its once prosperous free-market self .
The government owned the largest manufacturing firms in such industries as autos and steel . The top individual tax rates were 83 percent on “ earned income ” and a crushing 98 percent on income from capital . Much of the housing was government-owned . For decades , the U.K. had grown more slowly than economies on the continent . Great Britain was no longer “ great ” and seemed headed for the economic dust bin .
The major hindrance to economic reform was the powerful trade unions , which since 1913 had been allowed to spend union funds on political objectives , such as controlling the Labour party . Unions inhibited productivity and discouraged investment . From 1950 to 1975 , the U.K. ’ s investment and productivity record was the worst of any major industrial country . Trade-union demands increased the size of the public sector and public expenditures to 59 percent of GDP . Wage and benefits demands by organized labor led to continual strikes that paralyzed transportation and production .
In 1978 , Labour prime minister James Callaghan decided that , rather than hold an election , he would “ soldier on ” to the following spring . It was a fatal mistake . His government encountered the legendary “ winter of discontent ” in the first months of 1979 . Public-sector workers went on strike for weeks . Mountains of uncollected rubbish piled high in cities . Bodies remained unburied and rats ran in the streets .
Newly elected Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher , the United Kingdom ’ s first female PM , took on what she considered her main opponent — the unions . Flying pickets , the ground troops of industrial conflict who would travel to support workers on strike at another site , were banned and could no longer blockade factories or ports . Strike ballots were made compulsory . The closed shop , which forced workers to join a union to get a job , was outlawed . Union membership plummeted from a peak of 12 million in the late 1970s to half that by the late 1980s . “ It ’ s now or never for [ our ] economic policies , ” Thatcher declared , “ let ’ s stick to our guns. ” The top rate of personal income tax was cut in half , to 45 percent , and exchange controls were abolished .
Privatization was a core Thatcher reform . Not only was it fundamental to the improvement of the economy . It was “ one of the central means of reversing the corrosive and corrupting effects of socialism , ” she wrote in her memoirs . Through privatization that leads to the widest possible ownership by members of the public , “ the state ’ s power is reduced and the power of the people enhanced. ” Privatization “ is at the center of any programme of reclaiming territory for freedom. ” She was as good as her word , selling off government-owned airlines , airports , utilities , and phone , steel , and oil companies .
In the 1980s , Britain ’ s economy grew faster than that of any other European economy except Spain . U.K. business investment grew faster than in any other country except Japan . Productivity grew faster than in any other industrial economy . Some 3.3 million new jobs were created between March 1983 and March 1990 . Inflation fell from a high of 27 percent in 1975 to 2.5 percent in 1986 . From 1981 to 1989 , under a Conservative government , real GDP growth averaged 3.2 percent .
By the time Thatcher left government , the state-owned sector of industry had been reduced by some 60 percent . As she recounted in her memoirs , about one in four Britons owned shares in the market . Over 600,000 jobs had passed from the public to the private sector . The U.K. had “ set a worldwide trend in privatization in countries as different as Czechoslovakia and New Zealand. ” Turning decisively away from Keynesian management , the once sick man of Europe now bloomed with robust economic health . No succeeding British government , Labour or Conservative , has tried to renationalize what Margaret Thatcher denationalized .
How then to explain the impressive economic success of a fourth major economy , China , with annual GDP growth of 8 to 10 percent from the 1980s almost to the present ? From 1949 to 1976 , under Mao Zedong , China was an economic basket case , owing to Mao ’ s personal mismanagement of the economy . In his avid pursuit of Soviet-style socialism , Mao brought about the Great Leap Forward of 1958–60 , which resulted in the deaths of at least 30 million and perhaps as many as 50 million Chinese , and the Cultural Revolution of 1966–76 , in which an additional 3 million to 5 million died . Mao left China backward and deeply divided .
Mao ’ s successor , Deng Xiaoping , turned China in a different direction , seeking to create a mixed economy in which capitalism and socialism would coexist with the Communist Party monitoring and constantly adjusting the proper mix . For the past four decades , China has been the economic marvel of the world for the following reasons :
It began its economic ascent almost from ground zero because of Mao ’ s ideological stubbornness . It has engaged in the calculated theft of intellectual property , especially from the U.S. , for decades . It has taken full advantage of globalism and its membership in the World Trade Organization , while ignoring the prescribed rules against such practices as intellectual-property theft . It has used tariffs and other protectionist measures to gain trade advantages with the U.S. and other competitors .
It created a middle class of some 300 million people , who enjoy a decent living and at the same time constitute a sizable domestic market for goods and services . It continues to use the forced labor of the laogai to make cheap consumer goods that are sold in Walmart and other Western stores . It allows an enormous black market to exist because Party members profit from its sales .
It permits foreign investors to buy into Chinese companies , but the government — i.e. , the Communist Party — always retains a majority interest . It operates an estimated 150,000 state-owned enterprises that guarantee jobs for tens of millions of Chinese . It depends on the energy and experience of the most entrepreneurial people in the world , second only to Americans .
In short , the People ’ s Republic of China was an economic failure for its first three decades under Mao and Soviet socialism . It began its climb to become the second-largest economy in the world when it abandoned socialism in the late Seventies and initiated its experiment , which so far has been successful , in capitalism with Chinese characteristics .
There are clear signs that such success is no longer automatic . China is experiencing a slowing economy , is ruled by a dictatorial but divided Communist Party clinging to power , faces widespread public demands for the guarantee of fundamental human rights , and suffers from a seriously degraded environment . History suggests that these problems can best be solved by a democratic government ruled by the people , not a one-party authoritarian state that resorts to violence in a crisis , as Beijing did at Tiananmen Square and is doing in Hong Kong .
As we have seen from our examination of Israel , India , and the United Kingdom , the economic system that works best for the greatest number is not socialism with its central controls , utopian promises , and OPM ( other people ’ s money ) , but the free-market system with its emphasis on competition and entrepreneurship . All three countries tried socialism for decades , and all three finally rejected it for the simplest of reasons — it doesn ’ t work .
Socialism is guilty of a fatal conceit : It believes its system can make better decisions for the people than they can for themselves . It is the end product of a 19th-century prophet whose prophecies ( such as the inevitable disappearance of the middle class ) have been proven wrong time and again .
According to the World Bank , more than one billion people have lifted themselves out of poverty in the past 25 years , “ one of the greatest human achievements of our time. ” Of those billion , approximately 731 million are Chinese , and 168 million Indians . The main driver of this uplift from poverty has been the globalization of the international trading system . China owes most of its success to the trade freedom offered by the U.S. and the rest of the world . The latest edition of Index of Economic Freedom from the Heritage Foundation confirms the global trend toward economic freedom : Economies rated “ free ” or “ mostly free ” enjoy incomes that are more than five times higher than the incomes of “ repressed economies ” such as those of North Korea , Venezuela , and Cuba .
Israel ’ s socialist miracle turned out to be a mirage , India discarded socialist ideology and chose a more market-oriented path , and the United Kingdom set an example for the rest of the world with its emphasis on privatization and deregulation . Whether we are talking about the actions of an agricultural country of 1.3 billion , or the nation that sparked the industrial revolution , or a small Middle Eastern country populated by some of the smartest people in the world , capitalism tops socialism every time .","British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at the Conservative Party conference in 1989 (Reuters)

Israel, India, and the United Kingdom each lifted itself from economic stagnation by switching to free-market policies.

Socialists are fond of saying that socialism has never failed because it has never been tried. But in truth, socialism has failed in every country in which it has been tried, from the Soviet Union beginning a century ago to three modern countries that tried but ultimately rejected socialism — Israel, India, and the United Kingdom.

The Soviet failure has been well documented by historians. In 1985, General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev took command of a bankrupt disintegrating empire. After 70 years of Marxism, Soviet farms were unable to feed the people, factories failed to meet their quotas, people lined up for blocks in Moscow and other cities to buy bread and other necessities, and a war in Afghanistan dragged on with no end in sight of the body bags of young Soviet soldiers.

Israel

Israel is unique, the only nation where socialism was successful — for a while.

Most early settlers, American Enterprise Institute scholar Joseph Light pointed out, worked either on collective farms called kibbutzim or in state-guaranteed jobs. The kibbutzim were small farming communities in which people did chores in exchange for food and money to live on and pay their bills. There was no private property, people ate in common, and children under 18 lived together and not with their parents. Any money earned on the outside was given to the kibbutz.

The government’s share of the economy grew to 76 percent, while fiscal deficits and national debt skyrocketed. The government printed money through loans from the Bank of Israel, which contributed to the inflation by churning out money.

However, political parties are agreed that there is no turning back to the economic policies of the early years — the debate is about the rate of further market reform. “The world’s most successful experiment in socialism,” Light wrote, “appears to have resolutely embraced capitalism.”

India

Acceptance of socialism was strong in India long before independence, spurred by widespread resentment against British colonialism and the land-owning princely class (the zamindars) and by the efforts of the Communist Party of India, established in 1921. Jawaharlal Nehru adopted socialism as the ruling ideology when he became India’s first prime minister after independence in 1947.

For nearly 30 years, the Indian government adhered to a socialist line, restricting imports, prohibiting foreign direct investment, protecting small companies from competition from large corporations, and maintaining price controls on a wide variety of industries including steel, cement, fertilizers, petroleum, and pharmaceuticals. Any producer who exceeded their licensed capacity faced possible imprisonment.

As the Indian economist Swaminathan S. Anklesaria Aiyar wrote, “India was perhaps the only country in the world where improving productivity . . . was a crime.” It was a strict application of the socialist principle that the market cannot be trusted to produce good economic or social outcomes. Economic inequality was regulated through taxes — the top personal income tax rate hit a stifling 97.75 percent.

Some 14 public banks were nationalized in 1969; six more banks were taken over by the government in 1980. Driven by the principle of “self-reliance,” almost anything that could be produced domestically could not be imported regardless of the cost. It was the “zenith” of Indian socialism, which still failed to satisfy the basic needs of an ever expanding population. In 1977–78, more than half of India was living below the poverty line.

At the same time, notes Indian-American economist Arvind Panagariya, a series of external shocks shook the country, including a war with Pakistan in 1965, which came on the heels of a war with China in 1962; another war with Pakistan in 1971; consecutive droughts in 1971–72 and 1972–73, and the oil price crisis of October 1973, which contributed to a 40 percent deterioration in India’s foreign trade.

Economic performance from 1965 to 1981 was worse than than at any other time of the post-independence period. As in Israel, economic reform became an imperative. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had pushed her policy agenda as far to the left as possible. In 1980, the Congress party won a two-thirds majority in the Parliament, and Gandhi adopted, at last, a more pragmatic, non-ideological course. But as with everything else in India, economic reform proceeded slowly.

An industrial-policy statement continued the piecemeal retreat from socialism that had begun in 1975, allowing companies to expand their capacity, encouraging investment in a wide variety of industries, and introducing private-sector participation in telecommunications. Further liberalization received a major boost under Rajiv Gandhi, who succeeded his mother in 1984 following her assassination. As a result, GDP growth reached an encouraging 5.5 percent.

Economics continued to trump ideology under Rajiv Gandhi, who was free of the socialist baggage carried by an earlier generation. His successor, P. V. Narasimha Rao, put an end to licensing except in selected sectors and opened the door to much wider foreign investment. Finance minister Manmohan Singh cut the tariff rates from an astronomical 355 percent to 65 percent. According to Arvind Panagariya, “the government had introduced enough liberalizing measures to set the economy on the course to sustaining approximately 6 percent growth on a long-term basis.” In fact, India’s GDP growth reached a peak of over 9 percent in 2005–8, followed by a dip to just under 7 percent in 2017–18.

A major development of the economic reforms was the remarkable expansion of India’s middle class. The Economist estimates there are 78 million Indians in the middle-middle and upper middle-class category. By including the lower middle class, Indian economists Krishnan and Hatekar figure that India’s new middle class grew from 304.2 million in 2004–5 to an amazing 606.3 million in 2011–12, almost one-half of the entire Indian population. The daily income of the three middle classes are lower middle, $2–$4; middle middle, $4–$6; upper middle, $6–$10.

While this is extremely low by U.S. standards, a dollar goes a long way in India, where the annual per capita income is approximately $6,500. If only half of the lower middle class makes the transition to upper-class or middle income, that would mean an Indian middle class of about 350 million Indians — a mid-point between The Economist and Krishnan and Hatekar estimates. Such an enormous middle class confirms the judgment of the Heritage Foundation, in its Index of Economic Freedom, that India is developing into an “open-market economy.”

In 2017, India overtook Germany to become the fourth-largest auto market in the world, and it is expected to displace Japan in 2020. That same year, India overtook the U.S. in smartphone sales to become the second-largest smartphone market in the world. Usually described as an agricultural country, India is today 31 percent urbanized. With an annual GDP of $8.7 trillion, India ranks fifth in the world, behind the United States, China, Japan, and Great Britain. Never before in recorded history, Indian economist Gurcharan Das has noted, have so many people risen so quickly.

All this has been accomplished because the political leaders of India sought and adopted a better economic system — free enterprise — after some four decades of fitful progress and unequal prosperity under socialism.

United Kingdom

Widely described as “the sick man of Europe” after three decades of socialism, the United Kingdom underwent an economic revolution in the 1970s and 1980s because of one remarkable person — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Some skeptics doubted that she could pull it off — the U.K. was then a mere shadow of its once prosperous free-market self.

The government owned the largest manufacturing firms in such industries as autos and steel. The top individual tax rates were 83 percent on “earned income” and a crushing 98 percent on income from capital. Much of the housing was government-owned. For decades, the U.K. had grown more slowly than economies on the continent. Great Britain was no longer “great” and seemed headed for the economic dust bin.

The major hindrance to economic reform was the powerful trade unions, which since 1913 had been allowed to spend union funds on political objectives, such as controlling the Labour party. Unions inhibited productivity and discouraged investment. From 1950 to 1975, the U.K.’s investment and productivity record was the worst of any major industrial country. Trade-union demands increased the size of the public sector and public expenditures to 59 percent of GDP. Wage and benefits demands by organized labor led to continual strikes that paralyzed transportation and production.

In 1978, Labour prime minister James Callaghan decided that, rather than hold an election, he would “soldier on” to the following spring. It was a fatal mistake. His government encountered the legendary “winter of discontent” in the first months of 1979. Public-sector workers went on strike for weeks. Mountains of uncollected rubbish piled high in cities. Bodies remained unburied and rats ran in the streets.

Newly elected Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher, the United Kingdom’s first female PM, took on what she considered her main opponent — the unions. Flying pickets, the ground troops of industrial conflict who would travel to support workers on strike at another site, were banned and could no longer blockade factories or ports. Strike ballots were made compulsory. The closed shop, which forced workers to join a union to get a job, was outlawed. Union membership plummeted from a peak of 12 million in the late 1970s to half that by the late 1980s. “It’s now or never for [our] economic policies,” Thatcher declared, “let’s stick to our guns.” The top rate of personal income tax was cut in half, to 45 percent, and exchange controls were abolished.

Privatization was a core Thatcher reform. Not only was it fundamental to the improvement of the economy. It was “one of the central means of reversing the corrosive and corrupting effects of socialism,” she wrote in her memoirs. Through privatization that leads to the widest possible ownership by members of the public, “the state’s power is reduced and the power of the people enhanced.” Privatization “is at the center of any programme of reclaiming territory for freedom.” She was as good as her word, selling off government-owned airlines, airports, utilities, and phone, steel, and oil companies.

In the 1980s, Britain’s economy grew faster than that of any other European economy except Spain. U.K. business investment grew faster than in any other country except Japan. Productivity grew faster than in any other industrial economy. Some 3.3 million new jobs were created between March 1983 and March 1990. Inflation fell from a high of 27 percent in 1975 to 2.5 percent in 1986. From 1981 to 1989, under a Conservative government, real GDP growth averaged 3.2 percent.

By the time Thatcher left government, the state-owned sector of industry had been reduced by some 60 percent. As she recounted in her memoirs, about one in four Britons owned shares in the market. Over 600,000 jobs had passed from the public to the private sector. The U.K. had “set a worldwide trend in privatization in countries as different as Czechoslovakia and New Zealand.” Turning decisively away from Keynesian management, the once sick man of Europe now bloomed with robust economic health. No succeeding British government, Labour or Conservative, has tried to renationalize what Margaret Thatcher denationalized.

China

How then to explain the impressive economic success of a fourth major economy, China, with annual GDP growth of 8 to 10 percent from the 1980s almost to the present? From 1949 to 1976, under Mao Zedong, China was an economic basket case, owing to Mao’s personal mismanagement of the economy. In his avid pursuit of Soviet-style socialism, Mao brought about the Great Leap Forward of 1958–60, which resulted in the deaths of at least 30 million and perhaps as many as 50 million Chinese, and the Cultural Revolution of 1966–76, in which an additional 3 million to 5 million died. Mao left China backward and deeply divided.

Mao’s successor, Deng Xiaoping, turned China in a different direction, seeking to create a mixed economy in which capitalism and socialism would coexist with the Communist Party monitoring and constantly adjusting the proper mix. For the past four decades, China has been the economic marvel of the world for the following reasons:

It began its economic ascent almost from ground zero because of Mao’s ideological stubbornness. It has engaged in the calculated theft of intellectual property, especially from the U.S., for decades. It has taken full advantage of globalism and its membership in the World Trade Organization, while ignoring the prescribed rules against such practices as intellectual-property theft. It has used tariffs and other protectionist measures to gain trade advantages with the U.S. and other competitors.

It created a middle class of some 300 million people, who enjoy a decent living and at the same time constitute a sizable domestic market for goods and services. It continues to use the forced labor of the laogai to make cheap consumer goods that are sold in Walmart and other Western stores. It allows an enormous black market to exist because Party members profit from its sales.

It permits foreign investors to buy into Chinese companies, but the government — i.e., the Communist Party — always retains a majority interest. It operates an estimated 150,000 state-owned enterprises that guarantee jobs for tens of millions of Chinese. It depends on the energy and experience of the most entrepreneurial people in the world, second only to Americans.

In short, the People’s Republic of China was an economic failure for its first three decades under Mao and Soviet socialism. It began its climb to become the second-largest economy in the world when it abandoned socialism in the late Seventies and initiated its experiment, which so far has been successful, in capitalism with Chinese characteristics.

There are clear signs that such success is no longer automatic. China is experiencing a slowing economy, is ruled by a dictatorial but divided Communist Party clinging to power, faces widespread public demands for the guarantee of fundamental human rights, and suffers from a seriously degraded environment. History suggests that these problems can best be solved by a democratic government ruled by the people, not a one-party authoritarian state that resorts to violence in a crisis, as Beijing did at Tiananmen Square and is doing in Hong Kong.

Conclusion

As we have seen from our examination of Israel, India, and the United Kingdom, the economic system that works best for the greatest number is not socialism with its central controls, utopian promises, and OPM (other people’s money), but the free-market system with its emphasis on competition and entrepreneurship. All three countries tried socialism for decades, and all three finally rejected it for the simplest of reasons — it doesn’t work.

Socialism is guilty of a fatal conceit: It believes its system can make better decisions for the people than they can for themselves. It is the end product of a 19th-century prophet whose prophecies (such as the inevitable disappearance of the middle class) have been proven wrong time and again.

According to the World Bank, more than one billion people have lifted themselves out of poverty in the past 25 years, “one of the greatest human achievements of our time.” Of those billion, approximately 731 million are Chinese, and 168 million Indians. The main driver of this uplift from poverty has been the globalization of the international trading system. China owes most of its success to the trade freedom offered by the U.S. and the rest of the world. The latest edition of Index of Economic Freedom from the Heritage Foundation confirms the global trend toward economic freedom: Economies rated “free” or “mostly free” enjoy incomes that are more than five times higher than the incomes of “repressed economies” such as those of North Korea, Venezuela, and Cuba.

Israel’s socialist miracle turned out to be a mirage, India discarded socialist ideology and chose a more market-oriented path, and the United Kingdom set an example for the rest of the world with its emphasis on privatization and deregulation. Whether we are talking about the actions of an agricultural country of 1.3 billion, or the nation that sparked the industrial revolution, or a small Middle Eastern country populated by some of the smartest people in the world, capitalism tops socialism every time.",www.nationalreview.com,right,68yw2Gms0rDU0aSp

Obstinate House , threats of shutdowns , fears of starting war have been obstacles
Still , the deficit has been reduced , and the economy is improving
White House report : `` We 've cleared away the rubble from the financial crisis ''
It 's been five years since the banking and credit crisis rocked the U.S. economy , causing markets to plunge , unemployment to spike , housing values to crumble and placing more Americans in financial peril than at any time since the Great Depression .
On Monday , President Barack Obama touted his administration 's successes in helping to turn things around even though national economic growth remains sluggish and millions of people have given up looking for work .
Obama said government 's response `` put a floor under the fall '' and his policies set the stage for an end to economic contraction and created an environment for the economy to grow again .
The president specifically pointed to the impact of the economic stimulus , creation of seven million jobs , the resurgence of the bailed out Detroit automakers , higher taxes on the wealthiest earners and an increase in exports .
`` We 've cleared away the rubble from the financial crisis and we 've begun to lay a new foundation for economic growth and prosperity , '' Obama said .
Although Obama paints a rosy scenario , there are still key questions on the economy .
Also , the White House announced last week that top economic adviser , Gene Sperling , will step down as head of the National Economic Council and be replaced by Jeffrey Zients , the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget .
There is also the looming showdown with Congress on funding the government , raising the ability of the nation to borrow money to pay its bills , and continuation of the drastic budget cuts that took effect earlier this year absent a deal in Washington to reduce the deficit .
There is also the potential impact of the Affordable Care Act , the sweeping health care law backed by Obama that is taking effect this year and remains a political flashpoint with Republicans .
That motto was made famous by political strategist James Carville during Bill Clinton 's 1992 presidential campaign , and rang true for Obama 's first presidential campaign as well .
And the American public agrees . In poll after poll , fixing the economy is a stubborn No . 1 when it comes to the issues the voters most care about .
A CNN/ORC International poll conducted this month indicates that 41 % of the public says the economy is the most important issue facing the country right now , with health care at 16 % and the crisis in Syria at 15 % .
Soon after taking office , Obama signed a massive economic stimulus bill , led the charge for Wall Street reform and accelerated the bailout of the U.S. auto industry , which threatened to collapse and take more than 1 million jobs with it .
Some began to compare Obama to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt , who transformed the fabric of American society in the face of the Depression with aggressive government intervention .
But since his first two years in office , some experts say , the president has struggled to keep focused on the economy .
Liberal economist Dean Baker has been highly critical of his record .
`` I give him very poor marks . Five years later , the economy is still very far from recovering , '' said Baker , co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research , pointing to an unemployment rate that he says would hover around 9 % instead of 7.3 % if so many people had n't given up and dropped out of the work force .
Through much of last year , he had a 30 % approval rating on the economy . That number is up this year -- to 43 % -- but most still disapprove of his handling of the issue .
In 2010 , many conservatives , led by the tea party movement , sought to stop the president 's agenda . They voted out the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives and replaced them with conservative Republicans .
Then , those Republicans did what they were sent to Washington to do .

Syria aside , much of the White House 's attention this fall will be spent on getting Americans to sign up for the health insurance exchanges , the heart of the Affordable Care Act .

Obstinate House, threats of shutdowns, fears of starting war have been obstacles

Still, the deficit has been reduced, and the economy is improving

White House report: ""We've cleared away the rubble from the financial crisis""

It's been five years since the banking and credit crisis rocked the U.S. economy, causing markets to plunge, unemployment to spike, housing values to crumble and placing more Americans in financial peril than at any time since the Great Depression.

On Monday, President Barack Obama touted his administration's successes in helping to turn things around even though national economic growth remains sluggish and millions of people have given up looking for work.

Obama said government's response ""put a floor under the fall"" and his policies set the stage for an end to economic contraction and created an environment for the economy to grow again.

The president specifically pointed to the impact of the economic stimulus, creation of seven million jobs, the resurgence of the bailed out Detroit automakers, higher taxes on the wealthiest earners and an increase in exports.

""We've cleared away the rubble from the financial crisis and we've begun to lay a new foundation for economic growth and prosperity,"" Obama said.

Although Obama paints a rosy scenario, there are still key questions on the economy.

Also, the White House announced last week that top economic adviser, Gene Sperling, will step down as head of the National Economic Council and be replaced by Jeffrey Zients , the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget.

There is also the looming showdown with Congress on funding the government, raising the ability of the nation to borrow money to pay its bills, and continuation of the drastic budget cuts that took effect earlier this year absent a deal in Washington to reduce the deficit.

There is also the potential impact of the Affordable Care Act, the sweeping health care law backed by Obama that is taking effect this year and remains a political flashpoint with Republicans.

It's the economy, stupid

That motto was made famous by political strategist James Carville during Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign, and rang true for Obama's first presidential campaign as well.

And the American public agrees. In poll after poll, fixing the economy is a stubborn No. 1 when it comes to the issues the voters most care about.

A CNN/ORC International poll conducted this month indicates that 41% of the public says the economy is the most important issue facing the country right now, with health care at 16% and the crisis in Syria at 15%.

Soon after taking office, Obama signed a massive economic stimulus bill, led the charge for Wall Street reform and accelerated the bailout of the U.S. auto industry, which threatened to collapse and take more than 1 million jobs with it.

Some began to compare Obama to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who transformed the fabric of American society in the face of the Depression with aggressive government intervention.

'Poor marks'

But since his first two years in office, some experts say, the president has struggled to keep focused on the economy.

Liberal economist Dean Baker has been highly critical of his record.

""I give him very poor marks. Five years later, the economy is still very far from recovering,"" said Baker, co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, pointing to an unemployment rate that he says would hover around 9% instead of 7.3% if so many people hadn't given up and dropped out of the work force.

And it shows in Obama's approval ratings.

Through much of last year, he had a 30% approval rating on the economy. That number is up this year -- to 43% -- but most still disapprove of his handling of the issue.

A screeching halt

In 2010, many conservatives, led by the tea party movement, sought to stop the president's agenda. They voted out the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives and replaced them with conservative Republicans.

Then, those Republicans did what they were sent to Washington to do.

The president has struggled to pass any major economic legislation since 2010. Instead, he's been jumping from one political crisis to the next. Fights over federal budget and spending levels locked Congress in multiple battles in 2011 and 2012 that nearly led to the shutdown of the government.

The narrative didn't always fall in Obama's favor; nor did the policies that ensued. Republicans shifted the conversation from economic stimulus to deficit reduction. The president jumped on the deficit-reduction bandwagon and made that a priority.

Through protracted political battles over the size of the government, forced spending cuts, which sliced up to 10% of most of the federal budget, went into effect. It wasn't the president's favorite idea, however, for how to revive the economy.

He still had hopes of repairing old bridges and building new windmills. So did his supporters, who grew frustrated with the president.

""We're getting tired. ... The unemployment is unconscionable. We don't know what the (president's) strategy is,"" Rep. Maxine Waters, D-California, said in 2012.

But in the frame of deficit reduction, Obama was able to obtain a few concessions. He won a series of tax increases, including an increase on the top tax earners: those making more than $400,000 per year.

And the needle moved.

The budget cuts, tax increases and a recovering economy will reduce the deficit by about $4 trillion over 10 years, according to the White House.

The nation's debt ratio to size of the gross domestic product is expected to stabilize in the next decade, which economists hail as good for the economy.

The foreign affairs president

While the president came into office with little experience in foreign affairs and hopes to implement an expansive domestic agenda, overseas conflict has kept his plate full.

He expanded the war in Afghanistan and ended the war in Iraq. He kept his attention on the citizen-led revolts that swept the Arab world and expanded the use of drones.

Under his administration, al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed and the U.S. joined a NATO campaign to overthrow Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, and Obama is now working on an intense campaign to respond to the use of chemical weapons in Syria's civil war.

Although presidents are forced to walk and chew gum at the same time, world events have created challenges for Obama's ability to implement his domestic agenda.

Second term, second chance

After his re-election, the president hoped to reset his economic agenda. In his 2013 State of the Union address, Obama said he will work to ""reignite the true engine of America's economic growth: a rising, thriving middle class.""

This summer, he launched a campaign to revive his focus on the economy.

In a series of speeches this year, he acknowledged the troubling economic indicators that are keeping the economy from a full recovery, including income inequality and employment disparities.

Job creation, affordable education and home ownership were central to his proposals. Those initiatives included expanding development of renewable energy, creating new power grids and expanding access to early childhood education.

But what has the president done since that July speech? Some say, not much.

""Nothing has happened on any front,"" economist Zandi said.

White House press secretary Jay Carney pushed back, arguing that the president is still focused on those economic priorities.

""The president remains committed to pushing forward on an economic agenda that creates a better bargain for the middle class,"" Carney said Wednesday.

As new threats of a government shutdown over government funding and the debt ceiling loom, the president confronted the issue Monday.

""I can''t remember a time when one faction of one party promises economic chaos if it doesn't get 100% of what it wants,"" the president said, blaming the Republicans for potential ""massive economic turmoil.""

With ongoing political stalemates and a protracted fight over the budget and debt ceiling, Zandi said immigration reform, which would be a major catalyst for economic growth, appears to be heading nowhere in the House. And tax and entitlement reform, which would also help to stimulate the economy, have no chance of happening this year.

There's always next year. But 2014 is an election year, which creates an even more difficult environment for passing legislation. After that, the president is in his final two years of office, and the political machine begins shaping the next occupant of the Oval Office.

He ’ s worked for Burger King for nine years , plans to go on strike today as part of the international push by fast-food and retail workers to demand a living wage . He ’ s a member of the Stand Up Kansas City campaign . We last spoke with Terrance in August as the strikes were just beginning here in the U.S .
We welcome you both to ███ ! Terrance , let ’ s go to you . You have worked at Burger King for nine years . How much do you make an hour , if you don ’ t mind me asking ?
TERRANCE WISE : Well , I ’ ve worked in fast food for 17 years and at Burger King for nine years , and I make $ 9.40 an hour at Burger King .
AMY GOODMAN : I ’ m sorry , I didn ’ t catch what you said . Can you say that again ?
TERRANCE WISE : I ’ m sorry . I ’ ve been working fast food for 17 years , and Burger King I ’ ve worked for the past nine years , and I make $ 9.40 an hour working there .
AMY GOODMAN : And why are you going on strike today ?
TERRANCE WISE : Well , I ’ m going on strike for my family . I raise three little girls here in Kansas City , and I need their future not to look anything like the past . We ’ ve struggled with homelessness , paying basic utilities—gas , rent , the lights . And that ’ s while working every day . The working poor is what we are .
AMY GOODMAN : Are you concerned about retaliation if you go out today ? What has Burger King said ? Presumably , since this is being organized all over the country , Burger King and McDonald ’ s know that workers are going to be walking out .
TERRANCE WISE : Well , me , I first spoke to you , Amy , in August . That was my first strike . And this is number four for me . So , we know that the federal laws provide us protection when we come together as workers and demand the corporations we work for to pay us a living wage and to give us the right to form a union . So with that knowledge of knowing that the federal government protects our rights to organize and go on strike , it ’ s a huge relief for fast-food workers .
AMY GOODMAN : Terrance , how many hours a week do you work at Burger King ?
TERRANCE WISE : Well , it ’ s—I make $ 9.40 an hour , so it ’ s like 35 , 40 hours a week . It ’ s , after taxes , maybe $ 400 every two weeks . And that ’ s working double sometimes , going in in the morning and working at night , just not bringing in enough . And we know that these companies make billions in profit . They can afford to pay us better and do better by us and give us a voice on the job . That ’ s what we ’ re demanding .
AMY GOODMAN : Well , Catherine Ruetschlin , you ’ ve been studying this , the issue of what these fast-food companies can afford . Your report , “ Fast Food Failure : How CEO-to-Worker Pay Disparity Undermines the Industry and the Overall Economy. ” What is the disparity between the CEO , say , of Burger King and the workers , or McDonald ’ s ?
CATHERINE RUETSCHLIN : Well , you know , when I started the study , I didn ’ t know that fast food was going to be such an extreme outlier in terms of pay disparity . The study arose kind of in this context that Terrance and other workers like him have created , where there ’ s a growing awareness that inequality is undermining the economy at several levels . But when I dug into the data , what I found was that fast food is a catalyst , with inequality that outstrips all the sectors of the economy . The CEO of a fast-food company in 2012 earned 1,200 times what the typical worker earned that year .
CATHERINE RUETSCHLIN : Twelve hundred times . And that ’ s with a fairly generous assumption that workers in fast food are receiving benefits and work a full-time schedule , which in many cases , you know , isn ’ t true .
AMY GOODMAN : How does that affect the industry and the economy as a whole ? You say it hurts it .
CATHERINE RUETSCHLIN : That ’ s right . You know , there ’ s a macro-level story that ’ s just become a part of the conversation with organizations like the IMF and the World Economic Forum in Davos , pointing to inequality as a threat at the macro level because it generates instability in the economy and undermines growth . But then , at the micro level , firms are starting to wake up to the fact that it undermines their bottom lines , as well . In March , McDonald ’ s filed with the SEC and listed income inequality as one of the primary risks facing their own returns over the coming years , not just because workers are striking , but because they ’ re having a hard time satisfying their customers because they ’ ve underinvested in the front-line services that really build the brand and provide revenues to the firm .
AMY GOODMAN : How do you respond to the companies saying , “ All right , if they increase the workers ’ wages , but then consumers have to be willing to pay more for the burgers ” ?
CATHERINE RUETSCHLIN : Well , firms have a lot of ways that they could pay for a raise . They don ’ t necessarily have to pass the cost on to customers . They could do that , but they could also use some of the ways that they ’ re redirecting their profits right now . Firms like McDonald ’ s spend billions of dollars a year buying back their own shares of company stock on the market in order to consolidate ownership and bump up earnings per share and meet these short-term benchmarks . But that ’ s really a short-term understanding of the interest of the firm , right ? If they had a longer-term perspective , they would see that rather than investing in their share price , if they were investing in their labor force , they would generate returns—higher productivity , loyal workers with better knowledge of the company processes , you know , lower turnover rates , so lower costs associated with job search—and it would actually receive benefits through that investment that would pay off in the long run .
AMY GOODMAN : And the issue of how these companies are subsidized , government-subsidized ?
CATHERINE RUETSCHLIN : That ’ s right . A study came out recently that shows that fast-food employers , like McDonald ’ s , Subway , you know , Yum ! Brands , which owns Taco Bell and KFC and Pizza Hut , Domino ’ s Pizza , these are some of the highest-ranking employers in terms of working poor . So , if you can—if you look into who ’ s receiving healthcare benefits for their families and wage subsidies from the state agencies , from poverty alleviation programs , the highest-ranking firms are Wal-Mart and fast food . So , it ’ s the taxpayers who are actually paying the—for the ability for these firms to maintain a labor force at all .
AMY GOODMAN : Terrance , how does it feel to learn that the CEO makes something like 1,200 times more than what you make ?
TERRANCE WISE : Well , I know that workers like myself and my co-workers across the city , we go to work every day , and we ’ re the driving force behind his billions in profit he brings in . He ’ s buying new yachts and new boats and new cars , and I just want to put my kids through college . So , just to see the disparity that I ’ m making $ 9.50 an hour and he makes over $ 9,000 , and just to get that out to the public and that information to be known , it ’ s eye-opening . And it calls for change .
AMY GOODMAN : And , Terrance , the action you ’ re going to engage in today in Kansas City , what exactly are you going to do ?
TERRANCE WISE : Well , like I said earlier , this is my fourth time . And I ’ ll band together with the majority of the co-workers at my store and hundreds of workers from around the city , and we ’ ll go different parts of the city . We ’ ll do chants . We ’ ll hold signs . We ’ ll give speak-outs . We ’ ll try to enter some stores , like I heard them say on New York earlier . In New York City , they ’ ve been doing this , and we ’ ll be doing this here in Kansas City . It ’ s just to get the message out to the public and to our bosses in the companies , that we ’ re not afraid . We ’ re going to stand together in solidarity , and we demand better . We ’ re not asking for a minimum wage increase . It ’ s not a minimum wage drive . It ’ s for billion-dollar corporations that have the money to pay us better and give us the right to have a union in this industry .
AMY GOODMAN : Well , Terrance Wise , I want to thank you very much for being with us , Burger King worker on strike today , part of Stand Up Kansas City , speaking to us from Kansas City Public Television . And , Catherine Ruetschlin , one more thing , not only the issue of the pay ratio of worker to CEO , 1,200 to one , CEO of course being the 1,200 , but the fast-food CEOs earnings quadrupling .
CATHERINE RUETSCHLIN : That ’ s right . What we ’ ve seen is that at these firms that have benefited from economic growth , overall , the CEOs and top executives have been able to capture all of those gains . So , while the fast-food CEO pay grew by 470 percent since 2000 , worker earnings only grew by 0.3 percent . Now , that means that their earnings aren ’ t even keeping up with the basic cost of living , so they ’ re actually losing ground in terms of standard of living year after year .
AMY GOODMAN : Catherine Ruetschlin , I ’ d like you to stay with us , because next up after break we ’ re going to talk about Wal-Mart . President Obama spoke at a Wal-Mart recently . Right afterwards , 1,800 warehouse workers in California settled a major wage theft lawsuit against Wal-Mart and one of its largest contractors . This is ███ !

TERRANCE WISE: Well, it’s—I make $9.40 an hour, so it’s like 35, 40 hours a week. It’s, after taxes, maybe $400 every two weeks. And that’s working double sometimes, going in in the morning and working at night, just not bringing in enough. And we know that these companies make billions in profit. They can afford to pay us better and do better by us and give us a voice on the job. That’s what we’re demanding.

AMY GOODMAN: Well, Catherine Ruetschlin, you’ve been studying this, the issue of what these fast-food companies can afford. Your report, “Fast Food Failure: How CEO-to-Worker Pay Disparity Undermines the Industry and the Overall Economy.” What is the disparity between the CEO, say, of Burger King and the workers, or McDonald’s?

CATHERINE RUETSCHLIN: Well, you know, when I started the study, I didn’t know that fast food was going to be such an extreme outlier in terms of pay disparity. The study arose kind of in this context that Terrance and other workers like him have created, where there’s a growing awareness that inequality is undermining the economy at several levels. But when I dug into the data, what I found was that fast food is a catalyst, with inequality that outstrips all the sectors of the economy. The CEO of a fast-food company in 2012 earned 1,200 times what the typical worker earned that year.

AMY GOODMAN: Twelve hundred times.

CATHERINE RUETSCHLIN: Twelve hundred times. And that’s with a fairly generous assumption that workers in fast food are receiving benefits and work a full-time schedule, which in many cases, you know, isn’t true.

AMY GOODMAN: How does that affect the industry and the economy as a whole? You say it hurts it.

CATHERINE RUETSCHLIN: That’s right. You know, there’s a macro-level story that’s just become a part of the conversation with organizations like the IMF and the World Economic Forum in Davos, pointing to inequality as a threat at the macro level because it generates instability in the economy and undermines growth. But then, at the micro level, firms are starting to wake up to the fact that it undermines their bottom lines, as well. In March, McDonald’s filed with the SEC and listed income inequality as one of the primary risks facing their own returns over the coming years, not just because workers are striking, but because they’re having a hard time satisfying their customers because they’ve underinvested in the front-line services that really build the brand and provide revenues to the firm.

AMY GOODMAN: How do you respond to the companies saying, “All right, if they increase the workers’ wages, but then consumers have to be willing to pay more for the burgers”?

CATHERINE RUETSCHLIN: Well, firms have a lot of ways that they could pay for a raise. They don’t necessarily have to pass the cost on to customers. They could do that, but they could also use some of the ways that they’re redirecting their profits right now. Firms like McDonald’s spend billions of dollars a year buying back their own shares of company stock on the market in order to consolidate ownership and bump up earnings per share and meet these short-term benchmarks. But that’s really a short-term understanding of the interest of the firm, right? If they had a longer-term perspective, they would see that rather than investing in their share price, if they were investing in their labor force, they would generate returns—higher productivity, loyal workers with better knowledge of the company processes, you know, lower turnover rates, so lower costs associated with job search—and it would actually receive benefits through that investment that would pay off in the long run.

AMY GOODMAN: And the issue of how these companies are subsidized, government-subsidized?

CATHERINE RUETSCHLIN: That’s right. A study came out recently that shows that fast-food employers, like McDonald’s, Subway, you know, Yum! Brands, which owns Taco Bell and KFC and Pizza Hut, Domino’s Pizza, these are some of the highest-ranking employers in terms of working poor. So, if you can—if you look into who’s receiving healthcare benefits for their families and wage subsidies from the state agencies, from poverty alleviation programs, the highest-ranking firms are Wal-Mart and fast food. So, it’s the taxpayers who are actually paying the—for the ability for these firms to maintain a labor force at all.

AMY GOODMAN: Terrance, how does it feel to learn that the CEO makes something like 1,200 times more than what you make?

TERRANCE WISE: Well, I know that workers like myself and my co-workers across the city, we go to work every day, and we’re the driving force behind his billions in profit he brings in. He’s buying new yachts and new boats and new cars, and I just want to put my kids through college. So, just to see the disparity that I’m making $9.50 an hour and he makes over $9,000, and just to get that out to the public and that information to be known, it’s eye-opening. And it calls for change.

AMY GOODMAN: And, Terrance, the action you’re going to engage in today in Kansas City, what exactly are you going to do?

TERRANCE WISE: Well, like I said earlier, this is my fourth time. And I’ll band together with the majority of the co-workers at my store and hundreds of workers from around the city, and we’ll go different parts of the city. We’ll do chants. We’ll hold signs. We’ll give speak-outs. We’ll try to enter some stores, like I heard them say on New York earlier. In New York City, they’ve been doing this, and we’ll be doing this here in Kansas City. It’s just to get the message out to the public and to our bosses in the companies, that we’re not afraid. We’re going to stand together in solidarity, and we demand better. We’re not asking for a minimum wage increase. It’s not a minimum wage drive. It’s for billion-dollar corporations that have the money to pay us better and give us the right to have a union in this industry.

AMY GOODMAN: Well, Terrance Wise, I want to thank you very much for being with us, Burger King worker on strike today, part of Stand Up Kansas City, speaking to us from Kansas City Public Television. And, Catherine Ruetschlin, one more thing, not only the issue of the pay ratio of worker to CEO, 1,200 to one, CEO of course being the 1,200, but the fast-food CEOs earnings quadrupling.

CATHERINE RUETSCHLIN: That’s right.

AMY GOODMAN: Compared to what, with the workers?

CATHERINE RUETSCHLIN: That’s right. What we’ve seen is that at these firms that have benefited from economic growth, overall, the CEOs and top executives have been able to capture all of those gains. So, while the fast-food CEO pay grew by 470 percent since 2000, worker earnings only grew by 0.3 percent. Now, that means that their earnings aren’t even keeping up with the basic cost of living, so they’re actually losing ground in terms of standard of living year after year.

AMY GOODMAN: Catherine Ruetschlin, I’d like you to stay with us, because next up after break we’re going to talk about Wal-Mart. President Obama spoke at a Wal-Mart recently. Right afterwards, 1,800 warehouse workers in California settled a major wage theft lawsuit against Wal-Mart and one of its largest contractors. This is Democracy Now!

The only way Ryan is able to achieve this feat is by eliminating Obamacare and slashing funding for Medicaid and other domestic programs , including those targeted on low-income families .
That said , getting our fiscal house in order should be a high priority . The issue is not only how to do this—but also how quickly . Too much fiscal austerity in the near term could tank the economy .

economic_policy,Christian Science Monitor,1,https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/2019/0731/Rate-cuts-with-little-risk-The-unexpected-taming-of-US-inflation,Rate cuts with little risk? The unexpected taming of US inflation.,2019-07-31,Laurent Belsie,"Since then , inflation has become far tamer and those inflation expectations have dampened . That ’ s the sea change .
Like much of economics , the dynamics of inflation depend in part on people ’ s outlook – or expectations . If consumers anticipate lots of inflation ahead , they go out and buy things before the price goes up . That pushes up demand , which raises prices , and creates a self-fulfilling prophecy . That ’ s what happened during the 1970s .
“ It ’ s really , I think , a sea change in how people view inflation expectations , ” says Tim Duy , a Fed watcher and economist at the University of Oregon in Eugene . “ It ’ s really a different policy environment . ”
On one level , the reduction makes sense : Why not help the economy a little bit with lower rates when trade tensions threaten to get out of control ? On another level , however , it flouts decades of conventional economic thinking about consumers and their expectations about inflation .
The Federal Reserve Tuesday cut interest rates for the first time since the Great Recession a decade ago . It ’ s a sign that the central bank is more worried about the economy slipping back into recession than inflation rearing its head again .
Inflation – the rip-roaring variety that skyrocketed prices in the 1970s and shrunk pay raises to irrelevance – has gone missing for a long time in the United States .
Even in boom times , like now , price rises have been tame . And no one is quite sure why .
Against this backdrop , the Federal Reserve today cut interest rates for the first time since the Great Recession a decade ago . It ’ s a sign that the central bank is far more worried about the economy slipping back into recession than high inflation rearing its head again .
On one level , the Fed ’ s quarter-point rate reduction makes sense : Why not help the economy a little bit with lower rates when trade tensions threaten to get out of control ? On another level , however , it flouts decades of conventional economic thinking about consumers and their expectations about inflation .
“ It ’ s really , I think , a sea change in how people view inflation expectations , ” says Tim Duy , a Fed watcher and economist at the University of Oregon in Eugene . “ It ’ s really a different policy environment . ”
Like much of economics , the dynamics of inflation depend in part on people ’ s outlook – or expectations . If consumers anticipate lots of inflation ahead , they go out and buy things before the price goes up . That pushes up demand , which raises prices , and creates a self-fulfilling prophecy . That ’ s what happened during the 1970s .
Since then , inflation has become far tamer and those inflation expectations have dampened . That ’ s the sea change . Consumer inflation expectations seem permanently lowered – or anchored , to use the economists ’ term – so that even a noticeable rise in inflation is viewed as temporary . And central bankers are beginning to act accordingly .
“ It gives them some leeway to be able to ease ” interest rates even if the economy hasn ’ t begun to contract , says Laurence Ball , an economist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore . And if they ease too much and inflation jumps to 3 % instead of its 2 % target , “ that doesn ’ t really seem like a grave threat to the country . ”
The bigger threat is a downturn , Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in his statement at today ’ s press conference . “ Inflation ’ s return to 2 % may be further delayed and … continued below-target inflation could lead to a worrisome and difficult to reverse downward slide in longer-term expectations . ”
There is some precedent for preemptive rate cuts . During the 1998 Asian financial crisis , the Fed lowered rates in case the downturn spread to the U.S. ( It didn ’ t . ) In September 2007 , the Fed stepped in with a rate cut in case the economy went into a tailspin . ( It did , big time . )
If now the Fed has thrown off the boogeyman of 1970s-style inflation , it still faces the key question of why inflation hasn ’ t been stronger during the longest economic expansion in U.S. history .
When the economy is booming and businesses are hiring , demand soars for goods and services . Prices are supposed to rise in response . That ’ s always implied in the past a trade-off for the Fed : It can have low unemployment and high inflation or high unemployment and low inflation .
But in this boom , that relationship has broken down . The unemployment rate is near 50-year lows but inflation has also stayed low . The annual change in so-called core inflation , which excludes volatile energy and food categories , has been lower than the Fed ’ s 2 % annual target for long periods of time . By one measure , core inflation in June was 1.6 % .
Can the Fed thus ignore inflation and goose the economy by more rate cuts , as President Donald Trump is pushing for ? It depends , in part , on whether that trade-off is permanently broken .
There are many theories for why inflation has been so quiescent during the boom . It could be globalization , which allows Americans to import lower-priced goods when demand rises . It could be that technology is making some electronic goods cheaper . According to Mr. Ball , the Johns Hopkins economist , the problem lies with the way the Fed measures inflation .
Measured his way – which not only removes food and energy but takes into account other goods and services that have big price movements in a given month – inflation is actually right around the Fed ’ s target .
Future rate cuts could also be influenced by how much pressure the Fed is feeling from the markets and the administration .

The Fed ’ s future direction would be clearer if economists could reach a consensus on why inflation is so tame right now . But consensus can also lead to complacency .
“ I worry about that all the time , ” says Mr. Duy of the University of Oregon . “ As soon as we get our story straight on this stuff , boom , the story is going to change . ”","Since then, inflation has become far tamer and those inflation expectations have dampened. That’s the sea change.

Like much of economics, the dynamics of inflation depend in part on people’s outlook – or expectations. If consumers anticipate lots of inflation ahead, they go out and buy things before the price goes up. That pushes up demand, which raises prices, and creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. That’s what happened during the 1970s.

“It’s really, I think, a sea change in how people view inflation expectations,” says Tim Duy, a Fed watcher and economist at the University of Oregon in Eugene. “It’s really a different policy environment.”

On one level, the reduction makes sense: Why not help the economy a little bit with lower rates when trade tensions threaten to get out of control? On another level, however, it flouts decades of conventional economic thinking about consumers and their expectations about inflation.

The Federal Reserve Tuesday cut interest rates for the first time since the Great Recession a decade ago. It’s a sign that the central bank is more worried about the economy slipping back into recession than inflation rearing its head again.

Inflation – the rip-roaring variety that skyrocketed prices in the 1970s and shrunk pay raises to irrelevance – has gone missing for a long time in the United States.

Even in boom times, like now, price rises have been tame. And no one is quite sure why.

Against this backdrop, the Federal Reserve today cut interest rates for the first time since the Great Recession a decade ago. It’s a sign that the central bank is far more worried about the economy slipping back into recession than high inflation rearing its head again.

On one level, the Fed’s quarter-point rate reduction makes sense: Why not help the economy a little bit with lower rates when trade tensions threaten to get out of control? On another level, however, it flouts decades of conventional economic thinking about consumers and their expectations about inflation.

“It’s really, I think, a sea change in how people view inflation expectations,” says Tim Duy, a Fed watcher and economist at the University of Oregon in Eugene. “It’s really a different policy environment.”

Like much of economics, the dynamics of inflation depend in part on people’s outlook – or expectations. If consumers anticipate lots of inflation ahead, they go out and buy things before the price goes up. That pushes up demand, which raises prices, and creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. That’s what happened during the 1970s.

Since then, inflation has become far tamer and those inflation expectations have dampened. That’s the sea change. Consumer inflation expectations seem permanently lowered – or anchored, to use the economists’ term – so that even a noticeable rise in inflation is viewed as temporary. And central bankers are beginning to act accordingly.

“It gives them some leeway to be able to ease” interest rates even if the economy hasn’t begun to contract, says Laurence Ball, an economist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. And if they ease too much and inflation jumps to 3% instead of its 2% target, “that doesn’t really seem like a grave threat to the country.”

The bigger threat is a downturn, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in his statement at today’s press conference. “Inflation’s return to 2% may be further delayed and … continued below-target inflation could lead to a worrisome and difficult to reverse downward slide in longer-term expectations.”

There is some precedent for preemptive rate cuts. During the 1998 Asian financial crisis, the Fed lowered rates in case the downturn spread to the U.S. (It didn’t.) In September 2007, the Fed stepped in with a rate cut in case the economy went into a tailspin. (It did, big time.)

If now the Fed has thrown off the boogeyman of 1970s-style inflation, it still faces the key question of why inflation hasn’t been stronger during the longest economic expansion in U.S. history.

When the economy is booming and businesses are hiring, demand soars for goods and services. Prices are supposed to rise in response. That’s always implied in the past a trade-off for the Fed: It can have low unemployment and high inflation or high unemployment and low inflation.

But in this boom, that relationship has broken down. The unemployment rate is near 50-year lows but inflation has also stayed low. The annual change in so-called core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food categories, has been lower than the Fed’s 2% annual target for long periods of time. By one measure, core inflation in June was 1.6%.

Can the Fed thus ignore inflation and goose the economy by more rate cuts, as President Donald Trump is pushing for? It depends, in part, on whether that trade-off is permanently broken.

There are many theories for why inflation has been so quiescent during the boom. It could be globalization, which allows Americans to import lower-priced goods when demand rises. It could be that technology is making some electronic goods cheaper. According to Mr. Ball, the Johns Hopkins economist, the problem lies with the way the Fed measures inflation.

Measured his way – which not only removes food and energy but takes into account other goods and services that have big price movements in a given month – inflation is actually right around the Fed’s target.

Future rate cuts could also be influenced by how much pressure the Fed is feeling from the markets and the administration. After the Fed briefing, in which Mr. Powell suggested the cut was not the start of a long series of cuts, the stock market dropped sharply. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 330 points.

The market pressure probably plays a small role in persuading the Fed to cut rates, says Sarah Bloom Raskin, a visiting fellow at Duke University School of Law and former governor of the Federal Reserve Board. As for the president, “they’re not directly responding to his bullying them but they are finding a rationale that is essentially Trump’s doing, which is the volatility in the trade war. ... All Trump needs to do, going forward, is to keep uncertainty high on trade tensions and he’s going to have the Fed right where he wants it.”

Rich Households = Unaffordable Houses?

The line isn't smooth—and there are exceptions—but the relationship is clear: In general, richer cities have less affordable housing.

Super-Liberal Cities, Super-Unaffordable Houses

""Even after adjusting for differences of income, liberal markets tend to have higher income inequality and worse affordability,” Kolko said.

Kolko's theory isn't an outlier. There is a deep literature tying liberal residents to illiberal housing policies that create affordability crunches for the middle class. In 2010, UCLA economist Matthew Kahn published a study of California cities, which found that liberal metros issued fewer new housing permits.

economic_policy,Fox Online News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/07/24/washington-took-its-eye-off-economic-ball-obama-says-in-address/,Obama tries to offset current scandals by recycling talking points on economy ,2013-07-24,,"President Obama tried to offset a series of second-term scandals Wednesday by talking for more than an hour on the economy . Despite being hyped by the White House a day earlier as a major economic speech , Obama recycled many of his talking points .
His speech at Knox College comes as a new Fox News poll shows Obama 's approval ratings continuing to struggle , with just 46 percent of voters now approving of the president ’ s job performance , while just 25 percent of independents approve of the job he is doing , down from 31 percent last month .
During his speech , Obama said Washington has `` taken its eye off the ball '' as he pledged a stronger commitment to tackling the economic woes that strain many in the middle class nearly five years after the country plunged into a recession during his last years as president .
Obama returned to the college campus where he gave his first major economic address as a U.S. senator , and he chided Congress for being less concerned about the economy and more about `` an endless parade of distractions , political posturing and phony scandals . ''
`` I am here to say this needs to stop , '' Obama said . `` This moment does not require short term thinking . It does not require having the same old stale debates . ''
The president 's attempt to refocus on the economy comes amid some hopeful signs of improvement , with the unemployment rate falling and consumer confidence on the rise . But looming spending and budget deadlines this fall could upend that progress if Washington spirals into contentious fiscal fights like those that plagued Obama 's first term .
`` I believe there are members of both parties who understand what 's at stake , '' Obama said . `` But I will not allow gridlock , inaction or willful indifference to get in our way . ''
Even before the president spoke , Republicans panned his pivot back to the economy as little more than vague , empty promises .
`` It 's a hollow shell , it 's an Easter Egg with no candy in it , '' said House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio .
The president announced no fresh policy proposals , though he promised new ideas in a series of speeches he plans in the coming weeks . They will focus on manufacturing , education , housing , retirement security and health care .
On education , the president promised to outline `` an aggressive strategy to shake up the system , tackle rising costs , and improve value for middle-class students and their families . '' He renewed his call for increasing the minimum wage .
Despite pressing public concerns over jobs and economic security , the economy has taken a back seat in Washington to other issues in the first six months of Obama 's second term . That 's in part due to the White House 's decision to focus on other agenda items following Obama 's re-election , most notably stricter gun control measures and immigration .
Some distractions also have thrown the White House off balance , including revelations that the Internal Revenue Service targeted political groups and the Justice Department 's seizure of journalists ' phone records . Foreign policy crises , particularly in the Middle East , have competed for Obama 's attention , too .
The president said that while he will continue to press for his other agenda items , there will be few resources and little resolve for solving other problems without a strong economy .
Perhaps more than any other issue , the economy will also be central to Obama 's legacy as president .

Despite being hyped by the White House a day earlier as a major economic speech, Obama recycled many of his talking points.

His speech at Knox College comes as a new Fox News poll shows Obama's approval ratings continuing to struggle, with just 46 percent of voters now approving of the president’s job performance, while just 25 percent of independents approve of the job he is doing, down from 31 percent last month.

During his speech, Obama said Washington has ""taken its eye off the ball"" as he pledged a stronger commitment to tackling the economic woes that strain many in the middle class nearly five years after the country plunged into a recession during his last years as president.

Obama returned to the college campus where he gave his first major economic address as a U.S. senator, and he chided Congress for being less concerned about the economy and more about ""an endless parade of distractions, political posturing and phony scandals.""

""I am here to say this needs to stop,"" Obama said. ""This moment does not require short term thinking. It does not require having the same old stale debates.""

More On This...

The president's attempt to refocus on the economy comes amid some hopeful signs of improvement, with the unemployment rate falling and consumer confidence on the rise. But looming spending and budget deadlines this fall could upend that progress if Washington spirals into contentious fiscal fights like those that plagued Obama's first term.

""I believe there are members of both parties who understand what's at stake,"" Obama said. ""But I will not allow gridlock, inaction or willful indifference to get in our way.""

Even before the president spoke, Republicans panned his pivot back to the economy as little more than vague, empty promises.

""It's a hollow shell, it's an Easter Egg with no candy in it,"" said House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.

The president announced no fresh policy proposals, though he promised new ideas in a series of speeches he plans in the coming weeks. They will focus on manufacturing, education, housing, retirement security and health care.

On education, the president promised to outline ""an aggressive strategy to shake up the system, tackle rising costs, and improve value for middle-class students and their families."" He renewed his call for increasing the minimum wage.

Despite pressing public concerns over jobs and economic security, the economy has taken a back seat in Washington to other issues in the first six months of Obama's second term. That's in part due to the White House's decision to focus on other agenda items following Obama's re-election, most notably stricter gun control measures and immigration.

Some distractions also have thrown the White House off balance, including revelations that the Internal Revenue Service targeted political groups and the Justice Department's seizure of journalists' phone records. Foreign policy crises, particularly in the Middle East, have competed for Obama's attention, too.

The president said that while he will continue to press for his other agenda items, there will be few resources and little resolve for solving other problems without a strong economy.

Perhaps more than any other issue, the economy will also be central to Obama's legacy as president. The deep economic troubles that accompanied his first inauguration have eased and the stock market has soared. But at 7.6. percent, the nationwide unemployment rate remains high and millions more Americans are underemployed or have seen their wages stagnate.

""This growing inequality isn't just morally wrong. It's bad economics,"" Obama said. ""When the rungs on the ladder of opportunity grow farther apart, it undermines the very essence of this country.""

What a time that was – the uncomfortable-in-his-own-skin awkwardness ; the sad , pleading earnestness ; the inescapable aura of crushing sadness and defeat ; the Apple Watch . It was magical . And to counteract all that soul-withering desperation , there was the Jeb Bush promise , the much-mocked and self-evidently overoptimistic guarantee that under President Jeb the United States economy would grow at an annual rate of no less than 4 percent .
That promise was wildly out of step with historical averages – going back to 1968 , only one president , Bill Clinton , averaged 4 percent growth over a four-year term . And Jeb based his guarantee off his experience as governor of Florida , when he averaged 4.4 percent statewide growth on the strength of a perilously large housing bubble that catastrophically popped shortly after he left office ( somehow that detail never made it into the campaign literature ) . Regardless , “ four-percent growth ” was the mantra of Jeb the incurable optimist .
Well , as it turns out , ol ’ Jeb was nothing but a piker . Four percent ? That ’ s a loser ’ s goal . Because here comes Ted Cruz , the last man standing between Donald Trump and the Republican nomination , promising America that under his watch the economy will zip along at “ a minimum of five-percent GDP growth. ” Five percent ! As you might guess , that ’ s an even rarer accomplishment than Jeb ’ s guaranteed 4 percent . Harry Truman enjoyed 6.5 percent average growth in the post-war economic boom ; the Kennedy-Johnson administration of the early ’ 60s cleared 5 percent average growth ; and since then no president has broken the 5 percent barrier for a single term . Cruz is promising not just to break that trend but to deliver sustained growth at or above 5 percent .
How ’ s he going to get there ? Well , Ted Cruz has a plan . Per CNN : “ Cruz says it 's about going back to Reagan-style economics : cut taxes , scale back regulation on business and repeal Obamacare. ” Ted Cruz ’ s tax plan is unique in that it represents the most radical and aggressive upward redistribution of wealth of any of the plans offered by 2016 Republicans . His big idea is to completely restructure the tax code in such a way that the wealthiest Americans will reap massive windfalls . “ The overwhelming majority of the plan 's cost ( 79.6 percent ) goes to helping the richest fifth of taxpayers , ” Dylan Matthews noted at Vox : “ 43.7 percent goes to the top 1 percent alone. ” And as Bryce Covert writes at ThinkProgress , the assumption at play here – that colossal tax cuts for the wealthiest will trigger massive economic growth – is not backed up by research . What Cruz ’ s tax cuts will do , however , is explode the national debt by more than $ 10 trillion in the first decade , according to the Tax Policy Center .
But Cruz has an influential ally in his corner : Art Laffer , the high priest of trickle-down economics , who helped craft Cruz ’ s plan . “ Cruz 's tax plan is better than Reagan 's , ” Laffer told CNN . “ I think you 'll get growth rates higher than Reagan's. ” A good rule of thumb is that whenever you see Art Laffer extolling the amazing economic impact of a tax-cut package , assume the opposite will happen .
Laffer ’ s time as a Cruz tax advisor was preceded by a high-profile stint as tax advisor to Kansas Gov . Sam Brownback , who came into power by promising to turn the state into a laboratory of trickle-down economic theory . With Laffer ’ s help , Brownback passed a tax package that knocked out taxes on small businesses and deeply cut rates across the board . Appearing with Brownback to hype the tax scheme , Laffer confidently predicted it would succeed beyond everyone ’ s wildest dreams . “ This will lead to enormous prosperity , ” Laffer told a group of Kansans in 2012 . “ You are moving into the pro-growth world , and believe me it will work . ”
It did not work . The cuts predictably sent the state into a budget crisis as it scrambled to cover a series of massive deficits . To pay for these tax cuts , which overwhelmingly benefited the wealthy , Kansas imposed deep cuts to social programs and passed new consumption taxes that disproportionately affect the poor . And what did Kansans get for all this pain ? Not much :
In 2015 , job growth in Kansas was a mere 0.1 percent , even as the nation ’ s economy grew 1.9 percent . Brownback pledged to bring 100,000 new jobs to the state in his second term ; as of January , he has brought 700 . What ’ s more , personal income growth slowed dramatically since the tax cuts went into effect . Between 2010 and 2012 , Kansas saw income growth of 6.1 percent , good for 12th in the nation ; from 2013 to 2015 , that rate was 3.6 percent , good for 41st .
As for Laffer , he later clarified that when he said the tax cut plan would bring “ enormous prosperity , ” he didn ’ t mean it would happen immediately . “ You have to view this over ten years , ” he told a Kansas City Star columnist last October . “ It will work in Kansas. ” That , unfortunately , directly contradicted what he wrote in a 2012 report stating that he “ advised Oklahoma , Kansas , and other states to cut their income tax rates if they want the most effective immediate and lasting boost to their states ’ economies . ”
Now we ’ re supposed to trust Art Laffer when he says that Ted Cruz ’ s tax plan will bring wild economic growth that will outpace even Ronald Reagan ’ s economic record , which has become the stuff of mythic exaggeration among conservatives .

Conservatives should heed Tucker Carlson ’ s advice . We shouldn ’ t assume that what is good for markets is good for all of us .
Tucker Carlson ’ s monologue heard round the world is interesting on its own terms . In it , he argues against a conservatism that consistently prizes commercial interests above those of everyone else . I encourage you to watch or read it in full . Yet the response on the right is as interesting as Carlson ’ s monologue itself , for it reveals a discomfort among some conservatives for balancing the tensions that exist in our coalition and in our ideology .
There is , by many on the right , an effort to sing the praises of market capitalism without acknowledging the tensions between our pro-market principles and everything else . I respect Ben Shapiro a great deal , but I found this paragraph in his response to Carlson curious :
Supply and demand economics has powered most of the world ’ s human beings out of extreme poverty , and led to the richest society in human history . It has allowed us to live longer , in bigger houses , in more comfort . It has meant fewer dead children and more living parents . If we ’ ve blown that advantage , that ’ s our own fault . Traditional conservatives recognized that the role of economics is to provide prosperity — to raise the GDP . The role of a social fabric and a value system is to provide meaning .
To put a particularly fine point on it : Our economy has not produced fewer dead children and more living parents in America , at least not in the section of the country where I live . The opioid epidemic , in particular , has ravaged whole communities — driving down life expectancy , depriving children of their parents , and parents of their children . The human cost of this crisis is simply incomprehensible . In states such as Ohio , West Virginia , and Kentucky , countless children are growing up with parents in jail , incapacitated , or underground . Yes , they live in a country with a higher GDP than a generation ago , and they ’ re undoubtedly able to buy cheaper consumer goods , but to paraphrase Reagan : Are they better off than they were 20 years ago ? Many would say , unequivocally , “ no . ”
Some economic libertarians might say that these problems are the consequence of bad individual choices , and I wouldn ’ t entirely disagree . I grew up in a family plagued by addiction , and I saw some bad choices . Yet bad choices simply aren ’ t enough to explain the crisis — people have always made bad choices , and the familial , neighborhood , and economic contexts in which they live can exacerbate or improve them . Others might admit that it ’ s not all bad choices , that bad policy plays a role , but oddly the bad policy they point to is almost always the negative incentives of the welfare state . Again , they have a point — our welfare state is far from perfect , especially when it comes to encouraging work and family formation — but there are many other policies at play here .
To keep the focus on the opioid epidemic , the Los Angeles Times ’ reporting on the role of the pharmaceutical industry is both excellent and disturbing . It chronicles the ways in which some companies gamed our regulatory system to obtain approval and patent protection for highly addictive drugs . Those companies then knowingly lied about the safety of those drugs to doctors and patients . Some commentators have framed their problem with Tucker ’ s argument as promoting “ government intervention ” when that same intervention is the problem . But if you want to protect a community from drugs that can take hold of a person ’ s mind and destroy whole neighborhoods soon thereafter , you need some government intervention .
This raises a fundamental question with which so many of Tucker ’ s critics refuse to even engage : What happens when the companies that drive the market economy — and all of its benefits — don ’ t care about the American nation ’ s social fabric ? What happens when , as in the case of a few massive narcotics sellers , they profit by destroying that fabric ?
Surely our response can ’ t be : “ Well , the market will take care of it. ” The market is not a Platonic deity , floating in the sky and imposing goodness and prosperity from on high . It is the creation of our choices , our laws , and our democratic process . We know , for instance , that pornography has radically altered how young boys perceive their relationships with women and sex , and that the pornography industry has acquired a lot of wealth in the process of creating and distributing that content . Just last month , we learned that a Chinese entity created the first gene-edited baby , using a technology developed in the United States . Some company , here or there , will eventually create a lot of prosperity by using this gene-editing technology ( called CRISPR ) in an unethical way , quite literally playing God with the most sacred power in the universe — the creation of human life . In the past few years , it has become abundantly clear that Apple — despite self-righteously refusing to cooperate with American security officials — has willingly complied with the requirements of the Chinese surveillance state , even as China builds concentration camps for dissidents and religious minorities . And , as Carlson mentioned , there are marijuana companies pushing for legalization , though we know from the Colorado experience that legalization increases use , and from other studies that use is concentrated among the lower class , causing a host of social problems in the process .
All of these entities are doing what the market demands , and in some ways , it ’ s hard to blame them . But shouldn ’ t our laws and policy make life harder for them ? Or should conservatives cry “ small government ” every time someone suggests an intervention and stick our collective head in the sand , pretending there ’ s no relationship between market actors and the civil society we say we believe in ?
Of course , the recognition that corporate interests might not always align with civil society ’ s interests comes from the patron saint of capitalism , Adam Smith . We simply must develop the intellectual ability to understand the way in which law and policy drive outcomes in our society besides creating bad incentives for poor people . Sometimes they create bad incentives for the rich . Sometimes they allow the incentives that already exist to run roughshod over our communities and families . The market , as Smith understood , is merely a tool — a powerful tool , yes . But if we care about the flourishing of our society , and if we value ends besides a larger GDP , then we have to do the difficult work of balancing the competing demands of our values . Instead , many of our intellectuals simply pretend there is no competition — that what is good for markets is good for the rest of our nation . This is a recipe for boring thinking and bad policy .
This is not to say that all the fault lies with the failure of government to act in some way or another . Growing up in a household that was , by nearly every metric , “ disadvantaged , ” I loathed the cultural signal that told me , in essence : “ Because you are poor , you have no agency . Because you are disadvantaged , you are a victim of the system , and you might as well give up. ” So I understand and agree with the premise of David French ’ s response to Carlson , but having spent some time with Carlson , I don ’ t think he would disagree with the importance of emphasizing resilience even in the face of adversity .
There is , of course , a tension between acknowledging adversity and fighting to overcome it . It is a tension I ’ ve struggled with in my own life , and one that runs through my book Hillbilly Elegy . We can and should promote a cultural sensibility that values agency and personal responsibility . But if the conservative answer to people ’ s real problems is “ we can ’ t talk about them , because it promotes victimhood , ” then we are fighting a battle that we both deserve to lose and will lose .","Tucker Carlson at the 2018 Student Action Summit (Gage Skidmore)

But if you want to protect a community from drugs that can take hold of a person’s mind and destroy whole neighborhoods soon thereafter, you need some government intervention.

This raises a fundamental question with which so many of Tucker’s critics refuse to even engage: What happens when the companies that drive the market economy — and all of its benefits — don’t care about the American nation’s social fabric? What happens when, as in the case of a few massive narcotics sellers, they profit by destroying that fabric?

Surely our response can’t be: “Well, the market will take care of it.” The market is not a Platonic deity, floating in the sky and imposing goodness and prosperity from on high. It is the creation of our choices, our laws, and our democratic process. We know, for instance, that pornography has radically altered how young boys perceive their relationships with women and sex, and that the pornography industry has acquired a lot of wealth in the process of creating and distributing that content. Just last month, we learned that a Chinese entity created the first gene-edited baby, using a technology developed in the United States. Some company, here or there, will eventually create a lot of prosperity by using this gene-editing technology (called CRISPR) in an unethical way, quite literally playing God with the most sacred power in the universe — the creation of human life. In the past few years, it has become abundantly clear that Apple — despite self-righteously refusing to cooperate with American security officials — has willingly complied with the requirements of the Chinese surveillance state, even as China builds concentration camps for dissidents and religious minorities. And, as Carlson mentioned, there are marijuana companies pushing for legalization, though we know from the Colorado experience that legalization increases use, and from other studies that use is concentrated among the lower class, causing a host of social problems in the process.

All of these entities are doing what the market demands, and in some ways, it’s hard to blame them. But shouldn’t our laws and policy make life harder for them? Or should conservatives cry “small government” every time someone suggests an intervention and stick our collective head in the sand, pretending there’s no relationship between market actors and the civil society we say we believe in?

Of course, the recognition that corporate interests might not always align with civil society’s interests comes from the patron saint of capitalism, Adam Smith. We simply must develop the intellectual ability to understand the way in which law and policy drive outcomes in our society besides creating bad incentives for poor people. Sometimes they create bad incentives for the rich. Sometimes they allow the incentives that already exist to run roughshod over our communities and families. The market, as Smith understood, is merely a tool — a powerful tool, yes. But if we care about the flourishing of our society, and if we value ends besides a larger GDP, then we have to do the difficult work of balancing the competing demands of our values. Instead, many of our intellectuals simply pretend there is no competition — that what is good for markets is good for the rest of our nation. This is a recipe for boring thinking and bad policy.

This is not to say that all the fault lies with the failure of government to act in some way or another. Growing up in a household that was, by nearly every metric, “disadvantaged,” I loathed the cultural signal that told me, in essence: “Because you are poor, you have no agency. Because you are disadvantaged, you are a victim of the system, and you might as well give up.” So I understand and agree with the premise of David French’s response to Carlson, but having spent some time with Carlson, I don’t think he would disagree with the importance of emphasizing resilience even in the face of adversity.

There is, of course, a tension between acknowledging adversity and fighting to overcome it. It is a tension I’ve struggled with in my own life, and one that runs through my book Hillbilly Elegy. We can and should promote a cultural sensibility that values agency and personal responsibility. But if the conservative answer to people’s real problems is “we can’t talk about them, because it promotes victimhood,” then we are fighting a battle that we both deserve to lose and will lose.",www.nationalreview.com,right,LlmGZIz01xGxZJko

On almost every left-right issue that divides Democrats and Republicans — as well as Republicans themselves — there is a neglected populist constituency. The result is that populist politics are largely caricatured as Tea Party extremism — and a voice for the middle class is largely absent.

The problem with Obamacare is that its well-connected and influential supporters — pet businesses, unions and congressional insiders — have already won exemption from it. The rich will always have their concierge doctors and Cadillac health plans. The poor can usually find low-cost care through Medicaid, federal clinics and emergency rooms.

In contrast, those who have lost their preferred individual plans, or will pay higher premiums and deductibles, are largely members of the self-employed middle class. They are too poor to have their own exclusive health care coverage, but too wealthy for most government subsidies. So far, Obamacare is falling hardest on the middle class.

Consider the trillion-dollar student-loan mess. Millions of young people do not qualify for grants predicated on income levels, ancestry or both. Nor are their parents wealthy enough to pay their tuition or room-and-board costs. The result is that the middle class — parents and students alike — has accrued a staggering level of student-loan debt.

Universities are of no help. Their annual tuition costs have usually gone up faster than the rate of inflation. On too many campuses, vast increases in well-paid administrators, and lower teaching loads for tenured professors — as well as snazzy new campus recreation facilities — were all predicated on students obtaining more federal loans and going into astronomical debt to pay for those less accountable and far better off.

Illegal immigration also largely comes at the expense of the middle class. The supporters of amnesty tend to be poor foreign nationals who desire amnesty. Corporate employers and the elites of the identity-politics industry do not care under what legal circumstances foreign nationals enter the United States.

Mike Schmitt , CEO of The Metalworking Group , tells ███ that prices for cold-rolled steel have jumped by 18 percent since January , while hot-rolled steel ( a less-well-finished and less expensive product ) has increased in price by 30 percent .
`` The reality is that those are traumatic increases . They are shocks to our system , '' Schmitt says . `` This is n't a level of price increase where you can say 'oh , I 'll negotiate a little bit of it . ' You have to pass it on . ''
The Metalworking Group operates in the middle of the supply chain , buying raw steel from suppliers and cutting , stamping , or machining it into components for a wide range of industrial uses . Schmitt says he has several different contracts with steel suppliers , with prices usually updated every three months to avoid the difficulty of adjusting every time the price of steel fluctuates . Major contracts signed in January are expiring at the end of the month , and his business will have to start paying the higher prices in April .
Steel prices fluctuate as supply and demand rise and fall , but Schmitt says the increases he 's facing this spring are well outside of the ordinary . In contracts his businesses signs , they usually agree to ignore increases or decreases of less than 5 percent , as a way of smoothing typical volatility in the commodities market .
Trump has pitched his tariffs as being in the best interest of national security . `` If you do n't have steel , you do n't have a country , '' he famously tweeted shortly before announcing the 25 percent import tax . He has downplayed the potential threat of starting a trade war ( those are `` good , and easy to win , '' he announced on Twitter ) with America 's top trading partners , and others in his administration , like Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross , have downplayed the potential consequences tariffs have on American businesses that use steel .
But from Schmitt 's perspective , the tariffs are `` punitive . '' And while higher prices might help prop up American steelmakers , there are far more businesses like The Metalworking Group that consume steel , rather than make it . According to 2015 Census data , steel mills employed about 140,000 Americans and added about $ 36 billion to the economy that year , but steel-consuming industries employed more than 6.5 million Americans and added $ 1 trillion to the economy . In other words , for every steel-producing employee in the country who might benefit from Trump 's proposed tariffs , there are 46 employees whose companies may suffer serious economic distress .
Schmitt , 55 , says The Metalworking Group has no immediate plans to lay off any of his 180 workers in response to the higher production costs , but the tariffs will create plenty of other headaches . Contracts have to be rewritten to account for higher prices , which might cause some of his company 's customers to look elsewhere for the parts they need . Already thin margins will get narrower . Investment and expansion will be put off .
The consequences will be felt across almost every sector of the economy , from agriculture to manufacturing , and could raise the price of everything from electricity to beer . According to a policy brief released by the Trade Partnership , a Washington-based pro-trade think tank , tariffs are projected to cause 146,000 net job losses—five jobs lost for every job gained . Even protectionist think tanks like the Coalition for a Prosperous America project a net decline in American jobs as a result of tariffs . The only point of disagreement seems to be how bad things will get .
`` The uncertainty is whats troubling , '' says Schmitt , who has served as CEO of the company since 2000 . `` In a typical year , I 'd be looking at maybe buying more equipment or investing in the business . And now I do n't know what things are going to look like six months from now . It puts a chilling effect on the investment level . ''
Investors on Wall Street seem similarly shook . Global stock market have responded negatively to each new tariff announcement—most recently , the Trump administration 's outlining of plans to put $ 60 billion of additional tariffs on Chinese-made electronics , furniture , and other goods . Those tariffs are a serious policy blunder motivated by Trump 's protectionist politics , says Stephen Roach , an economist and professor at Yale . `` There 's not really a great appreciation of economic policy analysis in the Trump administration , '' Roach said during an appearance on Bloomberg this week .
If he could talk to the president or the White House 's top economic advisors , Schmitt says he would tell them that tariffs have the potential to undo the gains created by tax reform . While changes to the corporate tax system have encouraged investment and hiring , the steel and aluminum tariffs `` flies in the face '' of those positive developments .
He 'd also ask the president why he 's determined to repeat history . After all , the consequences of tariffs are not unknown . When George W. Bush imposed tariffs ranging from eight percent to 30 percent on imported steel , the higher costs dealt a $ 4 billion hit to the economy and led to 200,000 job losses , according to an analysis by the U.S. International Trade Commission . Bush 's former chief of staff has warned the Trump administration against pursuing the same course .
Schmitt says his business , like plenty of others , is still factoring in the price increases . It will take months for all the consequences to be seen .

Last summer Congress and the White House faced the same issue and gave it a temporary resolution by slapping a bandaid on it . Now , Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner is already weighing in on this round of debt limit talks , saying the United States should eliminate the debt ceiling altogether .
On Bloomberg TV , “ Political Capital ” host Al Hunt asked Geithner if he believes “ we ought to just eliminate the debt ceiling . ”
Well , this is something only Congress can solve , ” Geithner said . “ Congress put it on itself . We 've had 100 years of experience with it , and I think only once -- last summer -- did people decide to use it to threaten default on the American credit for the first time in history as a tool for political advantage . And that ’ s not a tenable strategy . ”

Last summer Congress and the White House faced the same issue and gave it a temporary resolution by slapping a bandaid on it. Now, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner is already weighing in on this round of debt limit talks, saying the United States should eliminate the debt ceiling altogether.

On Bloomberg TV, “Political Capital” host Al Hunt asked Geithner if he believes “we ought to just eliminate the debt ceiling.”



“Oh, absolutely,” Geithner said.



“You do? Will you propose that?” Hunt asked.



Well, this is something only Congress can solve,” Geithner said. “Congress put it on itself. We've had 100 years of experience with it, and I think only once--last summer--did people decide to use it to threaten default on the American credit for the first time in history as a tool for political advantage. And that’s not a tenable strategy.”



Hunt then asked: “Is now the time to eliminate it?”



“It would have been time a long time ago to eliminate it,” Geithner said. “The sooner the better.”

Every American who wants a job has one.

That’s the street-level understanding of “full employment.” With a jobless rate that fell to 3.9 percent last month, many economists -- including policy makers at the Federal Reserve -- say the U.S. is basically there.

On the surface, it’s an odd time to turn the government into an employer of last resort, hiring anyone who wants to work. But that’s what many Democrats are proposing, and not just on the party’s left. Could-be presidential candidates, including senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, are lining up behind versions of a jobs guarantee that may rank among the most radical economic plans debated in Congress for decades.

It would also be among the most expensive and disruptive, particularly for business -- part of the reason why the various draft bills likely won’t pass the current Congress and may struggle in future ones. Still, if politicians are betting that the once-fringe idea has traction, it’s because of doubts that underlie the upbeat labor-market headlines. What kind of jobs do fully-employed Americans have? And who’s left out of that picture?

‘Precarious, Low-Paid’

At the heart of the first question are issues of security, conditions and pay.

“We have had a growth in employment, but we have not had a growth in employment of decent jobs,” said William Darity, an economics professor at Duke University’s Sanford School of Public Policy, who’s contributed to job-guarantee proposals. “That’s the big issue. People have precarious work, low-paid work, no benefits or few benefits.”

In America’s recovery from the 2008 crisis, growth has skewed toward the wealthy. Wages have grown slowly by past standards, especially for low-paid workers. Jobs are also becoming less secure. A landmark study by Princeton’s Alan Krueger and Harvard’s Lawrence Katz found that all the net positions created in the decade through 2015 fell into the category broadly labeled the gig economy: contract-based, on-call, outsourced.

There are also 5 million part-timers who’d like to be full-time; 2.8 million people who lost a job last month or were on a temporary contract that ended; and 1.4 million who are looking for openings sporadically or have given up. The share of the working-age population that’s actually in work hasn’t recovered to the level it reached before the Great Recession, let alone its 2000 peak. Kevin Hassett, chairman of President Donald Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers, said in November that in some circumstances, more government hiring could help.

‘Fantasy-Land’

The most detailed version of the jobs guarantee aims to draw all those people back in. It’s been developed over the years by a group of unorthodox economists who call their school of thought Modern Monetary Theory, and argue that there’s more room for deficit spending than is widely believed.

Their plan, a blueprint for a proposal that Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is crafting, would offer work nationwide at $15 an hour, more than double the federal minimum wage. Funding would come from the federal government, but jobs would be assigned locally. There’d be a part-time option, and benefits including health care.

The net cost would be between $200 billion and $400 billion a year, the authors estimate. That’s roughly in the ballpark of federal spending on Medicaid, and would expand an already-widening budget deficit by as much as 2 percent of GDP.

The fiscal hit is just one reason many economists find the plan implausible. Brian Riedl of the conservative Manhattan Institute dismisses a jobs guarantee as “fantasy-land economics.” He said it would require higher taxes, and devastate industries like retail and fast food which pay below the proposed rate.

There are practical questions -- how to find useful work for millions of workers -- and philosophical ones about the government’s role in the economy.

‘Usurping the Market’

“It’s the sort of thing that sounds good on the surface, but the more they dig into it, they say how’s this going to work?” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities and a former Federal Reserve researcher. “It’s usurping the market.”

Stanley notes that the last time America attempted anything similar was during a real labor emergency: the Great Depression. President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s administration hired millions of workers across the U.S., largely for construction jobs.

New Deal programs fell short of a full federal jobs guarantee, and so do some of the current proposals. Booker is introducing legislation to test the idea in 15 communities. That’s not how the most important safety-net programs such as Social Security and Medicaid were born, points out Stephanie Kelton, a leading MMT economist. She was an adviser to Sanders in 2016, and has been working with him recently on a national jobs guarantee proposal.

‘Jobs, jobs, jobs’

There are House primary candidates running on the idea this year, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York, Randy Bryce in Wisconsin and Dan Canon in Indiana. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, a potential presidential nominee, has expressed support.

In November’s congressional mid-terms and likely in 2020, Democratic candidates will come up against Republicans campaigning on the successes of the Trump labor market. As the unemployment rate edged lower on his watch, the president has celebrated on Twitter. “Jobs, jobs, jobs” is a favorite refrain.

But unemployment was already under 5 percent, at the low end of recent norms, in November 2016 when Americans threw out the incumbent party and elected Trump. And in 2006, when the jobless rate was even lower, voters swept Republicans out of their congressional majority.

“The lesson from 2016 is that many Americans were left out of this economy, and particularly in places that have concentrated unemployment and a lack of resources,” California representative Ro Khanna said by phone. He’s working on his own jobs-guarantee bill, and says he hopes the idea will “become a serious part” of the Democratic platform.

Hardly Satisfied

Polling on the issue is sparse. Three-quarters of Americans worry about federal spending and increased deficits, according to Gallup. But Civis Analytics, a data firm founded by an aide to former President Barack Obama, found that more than half of Americans think the government should provide employment for those who can’t find it.

Support was highest among the young, the poor, and people of color. Jobless rates among minorities have reached record lows; still, black unemployment is nearly double the national level, and for Hispanic Americans it has averaged 6.5 percent over the last five years.

And even among those with jobs, “we have high rates of working poverty,” Duke’s Darity said. “We should hardly be satisfied.”

President Donald Trump will meet Tuesday with leaders from more than a dozen major companies , including Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV ’ s new chief executive Mike Manley and PepsiCo Inc. ’ s departing chief Indra Nooyi , as he shapes his economic message heading into midterm elections .
The executives are traveling to Trump ’ s golf resort in Bedminster , New Jersey , where he ’ s in the middle of what the White House calls a working vacation . The president will be joined by aides including his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner ; Larry Kudlow , his top economic adviser ; and deputy chief of staff for policy coordination Chris Liddell .
Trump enjoys business leaders ’ support for the tax law he signed last year and a deregulation agenda -- policies his administration contends are fueling economic growth and low unemployment . Trump ’ s corporate tax cuts have contributed to a surge in profits this year , accounting for 43 percent of earnings growth for the S & P 500 in the first quarter from a year earlier .
But some CEOs have criticized his immigration policies and , especially , his trade war with China and U.S. allies , which now threaten many companies ’ sales .
According to a list obtained by ███ News , Trump ’ s guests also include :
White House officials haven ’ t provided an agenda for the meeting and the CEOs have varied interests .
“ This is an opportunity for the president to hear from a number of business leaders from a variety of sizes and types of companies on how the economy is doing from their perspective and what their priorities and thoughts are for the year ahead , ” said White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters . “ These people are managing the American workforce . ”
Fiat Chrysler won Trump ’ s praise for a plan announced in January to shift its heavy-duty pickup production to Michigan from Mexico . But since the company won ’ t carry out that move until 2020 , and it will continue to import several models built in Mexico , Canada , Italy and elsewhere , it ’ s at risk of getting hit with tariffs under the same type of U.S. Commerce Department investigation used to justify steel and aluminum levies earlier this year .
Fiat Chrysler is also one of the biggest beneficiaries of Trump ’ s proposed rollback of U.S. fuel economy standards , but the policy could spur blowback for the company and the broader auto industry . California already is threatening to decouple its emissions rules from those set by the federal government , which could lead to years of litigation and a patchwork of standards that vary by state .
Package delivery companies like FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc. are straining to keep up with soaring demand from online shopping , which surged 17 percent in 2017 . Industrial freight is also rebounding . But Trump ’ s escalating trade war could interrupt the companies ’ upward trajectory , especially in FedEx ’ s new European package delivery business that ’ s already costing more to integrate than expected . FedEx confirmed their CEO ’ s participation at the Tuesday meeting with Trump , but didn ’ t give details on planned talking points .
PepsiCo ’ s giant North American beverage unit has been hit by higher transport costs and aluminum prices , exacerbated by Trump ’ s 10 percent tariffs on imports of the metal .
Boeing , the second-largest U.S. defense contractor , has benefited as Trump boosted military budgets and extolled its fighter jets to foreign heads of state . But Trump ’ s trade policies also threaten the largest U.S. exporter as the president has escalated tensions with China , the largest overseas market for Boeing jetliners , and imposed aluminum tariffs that hiked costs for some of the manufacturer ’ s suppliers . A Boeing spokesman couldn ’ t immediately comment on Muilenburg ’ s agenda for the evening .
Like Boeing , Honeywell is keenly focused on both defense spending and the state of the aviation market . The Morris Plains , New Jersey-based manufacturer will become more dependent on aerospace after the planned spin-offs of its automobile turbocharger and home-products units later this year .

The executives are traveling to Trump’s golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, where he’s in the middle of what the White House calls a working vacation. The president will be joined by aides including his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner; Larry Kudlow, his top economic adviser; and deputy chief of staff for policy coordination Chris Liddell.

Trump enjoys business leaders’ support for the tax law he signed last year and a deregulation agenda -- policies his administration contends are fueling economic growth and low unemployment. Trump’s corporate tax cuts have contributed to a surge in profits this year, accounting for 43 percent of earnings growth for the S&P 500 in the first quarter from a year earlier.

But some CEOs have criticized his immigration policies and, especially, his trade war with China and U.S. allies, which now threaten many companies’ sales.

According to a list obtained by Bloomberg News, Trump’s guests also include:

White House officials haven’t provided an agenda for the meeting and the CEOs have varied interests.

“This is an opportunity for the president to hear from a number of business leaders from a variety of sizes and types of companies on how the economy is doing from their perspective and what their priorities and thoughts are for the year ahead,” said White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters. “These people are managing the American workforce.”

Fiat Chrysler won Trump’s praise for a plan announced in January to shift its heavy-duty pickup production to Michigan from Mexico. But since the company won’t carry out that move until 2020, and it will continue to import several models built in Mexico, Canada, Italy and elsewhere, it’s at risk of getting hit with tariffs under the same type of U.S. Commerce Department investigation used to justify steel and aluminum levies earlier this year.

Fiat Chrysler is also one of the biggest beneficiaries of Trump’s proposed rollback of U.S. fuel economy standards, but the policy could spur blowback for the company and the broader auto industry. California already is threatening to decouple its emissions rules from those set by the federal government, which could lead to years of litigation and a patchwork of standards that vary by state.

Package delivery companies like FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc. are straining to keep up with soaring demand from online shopping, which surged 17 percent in 2017. Industrial freight is also rebounding. But Trump’s escalating trade war could interrupt the companies’ upward trajectory, especially in FedEx’s new European package delivery business that’s already costing more to integrate than expected. FedEx confirmed their CEO’s participation at the Tuesday meeting with Trump, but didn’t give details on planned talking points.

PepsiCo’s giant North American beverage unit has been hit by higher transport costs and aluminum prices, exacerbated by Trump’s 10 percent tariffs on imports of the metal.

Boeing, the second-largest U.S. defense contractor, has benefited as Trump boosted military budgets and extolled its fighter jets to foreign heads of state. But Trump’s trade policies also threaten the largest U.S. exporter as the president has escalated tensions with China, the largest overseas market for Boeing jetliners, and imposed aluminum tariffs that hiked costs for some of the manufacturer’s suppliers. A Boeing spokesman couldn’t immediately comment on Muilenburg’s agenda for the evening.

Like Boeing, Honeywell is keenly focused on both defense spending and the state of the aviation market. The Morris Plains, New Jersey-based manufacturer will become more dependent on aerospace after the planned spin-offs of its automobile turbocharger and home-products units later this year.

We recently learned that China is poised to replace the United States as the No. 1 economic power in the world sometime later this year. Our anemic quarterly growth rate of 0.1 percent certainly lends credence to this speculation. We must seriously question those who say our nation is not in decline. They are adopting the ostrich strategy and sticking their heads in the sand.

There is no question that America is the pinnacle nation of the world currently and is likely to remain in that position for several years, given our military strength and the depth and stability of our financial infrastructure. However, overconfidence is the frequent companion of catastrophic decline, as confirmed by numerous historical writings. If we continue our fiscally irresponsible ways, coupled with our arrogance, there exists no other possibility than self-ruination.

Our ability to print money is already in jeopardy as some other nations have begun making noises about altering the international reserve-currency system to emphasize multiple currencies, elevating their status and decreasing the strength of the U.S. dollar. Our ever-increasing national debt would then place us on shaky ground. The Treasury securities we have been offering to China and others would no longer hold the same appeal, and all the borrowing we have done against the financial well-being of our progeny will come back to plague us and them.

Many who are responsible for putting us in this precarious position would argue that we really don’t need to worry about countries such as China replacing us as the pinnacle nation in the world, because they have too many structural problems. For instance, China is far behind us in per-capita income, creating many social issues and negatively impacting growth of the middle class, which is the most effective growth engine.

Their paucity of appropriate environmental controls has led to lethal industrial pollution, encouraging some of the intellectually gifted and mobile citizens to leave the country. China also has a very weak banking system, with too much government interference, which means their currency is unlikely to be accepted by the rest of the world as the reserve currency for many years. They could, however, recognize and correct these deficiencies more rapidly than expected, thereby enhancing their position as a formidable challenger to the United States.

Even if the these problems are rectified, China cannot expect continuation of the kind of economic expansion we have recently witnessed but is now rapidly dissipating. If the United States has the good sense to significantly lower its corporate-tax rate, this dissipation will accelerate. Additionally, the lack of intellectual-private-property protection in China will prevent it from generating the kind of innovation that usually accompanies pinnacle-nation status.

When it comes to energy, China has large potential reserves of shale gas, but natural water is largely lacking in those areas, making extraction difficult without new technology. We may be unable to exploit this weakness because of self-imposed, shortsighted overregulation of the energy sector in our country.

From these few examples, it can be seen that a combination of wise moves by China and unwise moves by the United States in the next few years could have very troubling implications for the future of our country.

If there is a sudden, cataclysmic debt-engendered financial crisis in the United States, China is only one of a number of possible successors to our pinnacle position. Perhaps our energy should be expended on figuring out how to not only avoid financial collapse, but also how to invigorate the most powerful economic engine the world has ever known. We should take advantage of the great laboratory of ideas; namely, successful states that have gone from severe budgetary deficits to significant surpluses through actions of wise governors and legislative bodies. Let’s look at their taxation policies and the business conditions they created that stimulated economic activity. There is nothing partisan about this approach; rather, it would be a manifestation of common sense, which should know no political affiliation.

The economic problems we are experiencing in this country, fortunately, are induced by our own ineptitude. I say fortunately, because it is within our own power to alter our course. We do not have to depend on the good will of someone else. When we are able to work together, as was the case with the Simpson-Bowles commission on fiscal responsibility, which was not perfect, but better than nothing, excellent ideas can be generated that can move us along the path of economic recovery.

There is general agreement that our system of federal taxation makes little sense and is overly complicated, yet we have failed to do anything about it. We also continue to thrust the heavy foot of the government on to the necks of both small and large businesses, stifling growth and innovation. Energy policies actually aimed at energy production could be a tremendous boost to our financial bottom line.

In a hearing of the Senate Committee on Health , Education , Labor and Pensions last week on “ indexing the minimum wage , ” Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren inquired of University of Massachusetts professor economics Arindrajit Dube , “ If we started in 1960 , and we said that , as productivity goes up — that is , as workers are producing more — then the minimum wage is going to go up the same .

Ed Morrissey explained in The Fiscal Times last month why another minimum wage increase would almost certainly lead to fewer jobs , higher unemployment , and more disappointed teenagers :

By July 2008 , overall unemployment had jumped to 5.8 percent due to the then-moderate recession that had begun in December 2007 , but youth unemployment rocketed upward by more than five full points to 20.7 percent . As the wage floor stepped upward to its present level by July 2009 , the youth unemployment rate rose to 24.3 percent . And while the overall unemployment rate has declined from 9.5 percent at that time to 7.9 percent now ( albeit with a plummeting workforce masking the true nature of chronic unemployment ) , youth unemployment remains at nearly the same level as in July 2009 , at 23.4 percent .

economic_policy,Fox Online News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/05/21/no-matter-who-it-is-next-president-to-face-economic-challenge.html,"No matter who it is, next president to face economic challenge",2016-05-21,Barnini Chakraborty,"Bill Clinton rode into office 24 years ago on the campaign mantra , ‘ It ’ s the economy , stupid ’ – and apparently , it still is .
In an election where dim economic prospects have fueled the campaigns of both Democrat Bernie Sanders and Republican Donald Trump , a new Fox News poll shows the economy still is far and away the top priority for voters . And faced with flashing warning signs of tepid growth , barely rising wages and factors that signal an even further slowdown , what would a President Trump or Clinton or Sanders do about it ?
The proposals span the gamut : Trump wants big tax cuts and tariffs on trading partners . Sanders wants a hike in the minimum wage and free college tuition . Hillary Clinton wants more infrastructure spending .
And each candidate has taken the others to task on their positions and plans .
Clinton economic adviser Gene Sperling recently warned that if Trump was elected he would put the entire financial system at risk . That was after Trump said he could reduce the national debt by getting the government to pay back less than it has borrowed .
Trump , though , has slammed his likely Democratic rival over trade policies , including the North American Free Trade Agreement that Clinton ’ s husband signed into law in 1993 .
`` It has cleaned out our country of jobs , '' Trump told Fox News on Friday .
Trump says he ’ d be the “ greatest jobs producer in history ” by slapping tariffs on Mexico , China and other trade partners .
“ The lines have been crossed , ” Carroll Doherty , director of political research at Pew Research Center , said . “ The Republicans were always known as the party of free trade and now they are less supportive of free trade than Democrats . ”
The stakes are high , as the next president is likely to face a lingering economic challenge all in the wake of the last recession .
A Wall Street Journal survey of economists earlier this month showed an elevated risk ( about 20 percent ) of another U.S. recession in the next year . One of those economists , the National Association of Manufacturers ’ Chad Moutray , cited : “ Decelerating employment growth , growing uncertainty and sputtering GDP growth . ”
Income inequality continues to strike a deep divide between the haves and have-nots , which the candidates also have seized on .
Clinton pledges to enact the “ Buffett Rule ” – a basic principle that ensures no household making more than $ 1 million annually should pay a smaller share of their income in taxes than a middle-class family pays .
Clinton also promises to strip tax benefits from U.S. companies that move jobs to foreign countries to get a more favorable rate . And she says she ’ ll help small businesses by expanding access to capital and vows to invest $ 350 billion in secondary education .
Clinton supports as well raising the federal minimum wage to at least $ 12 – currently , it ’ s at $ 7.25 for covered nonexempt employees . Clinton has also shown support for the Fight for $ 15 campaign which pushes for even higher minimum wages in individual states .
It ’ s a fight Sanders has taken on since the start of his campaign . And he 's accused Clinton of being late to the party . At a CNN debate in April , Sanders mocked Clinton ’ s declaration of support : “ What has happened is that history has outpaced Secretary Clinton . ”
Sanders repeatedly has described tackling income inequality as the hallmark of his campaign . He also has vowed to break up big banks , cap credit card rates at 15 percent and limit ways some in the financial industry have been able to monetarily benefit from taxpayer bailouts .
Trump , meanwhile , takes the opposite tack . Trump says dismantling the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul would be one of his top priorities . He ’ s also said he ’ d boot out Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen .
While the candidates push for more economic changes , there are bright spots .
When President Obama took office , the economy was losing 800,000 jobs a month . The unemployment rate has since fallen dramatically , from 10 percent to 5 percent . During Obama ’ s two terms , the private sector has added jobs for 73 straight months .
Still , hard economic realities face the country , putting pressure on the next Oval Office occupant to engineer a jump-start .
The economy grew at its weakest quarterly pace in two years between January and March -- 0.5 percent -- as consumers spent cautiously . Businesses cut back on investments to levels not seen since the financial crisis of 2008 . And there was a massive stock market sell-off at the start of the year which eroded consumer confidence .
And while the budget deficit -- the federal government 's annual shortfall -- has shrunk by nearly $ 1 trillion , Washington continues to spend far more than it earns , swelling the national debt beyond $ 19 trillion . It 's a factor that could increasingly limit the government 's ability to spend its way out of an economic downturn .
Should the country find itself in another recession , James Pethokoukis , an expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute , says a Trump response would likely be based on a “ truly massive tax cut ” -- and more .
“ He also likes to do infrastructure . Fantastic , he can throw in some infrastructure in there as well . Doesn ’ t care about the debt ? Who cares ? Fine . So we have a massive tax cut , maybe massive infrastructure spending , ” Pethokoukis said . “ A Donald Trump presidency during a recession – assuming that his trade conflict doesn ’ t cause the recession – might just be like the Democratic dream president . ”","Bill Clinton rode into office 24 years ago on the campaign mantra, ‘It’s the economy, stupid’ – and apparently, it still is.

In an election where dim economic prospects have fueled the campaigns of both Democrat Bernie Sanders and Republican Donald Trump, a new Fox News poll shows the economy still is far and away the top priority for voters. And faced with flashing warning signs of tepid growth, barely rising wages and factors that signal an even further slowdown, what would a President Trump or Clinton or Sanders do about it?

The proposals span the gamut: Trump wants big tax cuts and tariffs on trading partners. Sanders wants a hike in the minimum wage and free college tuition. Hillary Clinton wants more infrastructure spending.

And each candidate has taken the others to task on their positions and plans.

Clinton economic adviser Gene Sperling recently warned that if Trump was elected he would put the entire financial system at risk. That was after Trump said he could reduce the national debt by getting the government to pay back less than it has borrowed.

Trump, though, has slammed his likely Democratic rival over trade policies, including the North American Free Trade Agreement that Clinton’s husband signed into law in 1993.

""It has cleaned out our country of jobs,"" Trump told Fox News on Friday.

Trump says he’d be the “greatest jobs producer in history” by slapping tariffs on Mexico, China and other trade partners.

That's a big shift for Republicans.

“The lines have been crossed,” Carroll Doherty, director of political research at Pew Research Center, said. “The Republicans were always known as the party of free trade and now they are less supportive of free trade than Democrats.”

The stakes are high, as the next president is likely to face a lingering economic challenge all in the wake of the last recession.

A Wall Street Journal survey of economists earlier this month showed an elevated risk (about 20 percent) of another U.S. recession in the next year. One of those economists, the National Association of Manufacturers’ Chad Moutray, cited: “Decelerating employment growth, growing uncertainty and sputtering GDP growth.”

Income inequality continues to strike a deep divide between the haves and have-nots, which the candidates also have seized on.

Clinton pledges to enact the “Buffett Rule” – a basic principle that ensures no household making more than $1 million annually should pay a smaller share of their income in taxes than a middle-class family pays.

Clinton also promises to strip tax benefits from U.S. companies that move jobs to foreign countries to get a more favorable rate. And she says she’ll help small businesses by expanding access to capital and vows to invest $350 billion in secondary education.

Clinton supports as well raising the federal minimum wage to at least $12 – currently, it’s at $7.25 for covered nonexempt employees. Clinton has also shown support for the Fight for $15 campaign which pushes for even higher minimum wages in individual states.

It’s a fight Sanders has taken on since the start of his campaign. And he's accused Clinton of being late to the party. At a CNN debate in April, Sanders mocked Clinton’s declaration of support: “What has happened is that history has outpaced Secretary Clinton.”

Sanders repeatedly has described tackling income inequality as the hallmark of his campaign. He also has vowed to break up big banks, cap credit card rates at 15 percent and limit ways some in the financial industry have been able to monetarily benefit from taxpayer bailouts.

Trump, meanwhile, takes the opposite tack. Trump says dismantling the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul would be one of his top priorities. He’s also said he’d boot out Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen.

While the candidates push for more economic changes, there are bright spots.

When President Obama took office, the economy was losing 800,000 jobs a month. The unemployment rate has since fallen dramatically, from 10 percent to 5 percent. During Obama’s two terms, the private sector has added jobs for 73 straight months.

Still, hard economic realities face the country, putting pressure on the next Oval Office occupant to engineer a jump-start.

The economy grew at its weakest quarterly pace in two years between January and March -- 0.5 percent -- as consumers spent cautiously. Businesses cut back on investments to levels not seen since the financial crisis of 2008. And there was a massive stock market sell-off at the start of the year which eroded consumer confidence.

And while the budget deficit -- the federal government's annual shortfall -- has shrunk by nearly $1 trillion, Washington continues to spend far more than it earns, swelling the national debt beyond $19 trillion. It's a factor that could increasingly limit the government's ability to spend its way out of an economic downturn.

Should the country find itself in another recession, James Pethokoukis, an expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, says a Trump response would likely be based on a “truly massive tax cut” -- and more.

“He also likes to do infrastructure. Fantastic, he can throw in some infrastructure in there as well. Doesn’t care about the debt? Who cares? Fine. So we have a massive tax cut, maybe massive infrastructure spending,” Pethokoukis said. “A Donald Trump presidency during a recession – assuming that his trade conflict doesn’t cause the recession – might just be like the Democratic dream president.”",www.foxnews.com,right,0cMlth1akP2vskBF

Capitalism.,2019-02-04,Sean Illing,"“ If Millennials are different , it ’ s not because we ’ re more or less evolved than our parents or grandparents , it ’ s because they ’ ve changed the world in ways that have produced people like us . ”
That ’ s how Malcolm Harris , an editor at the online magazine the New Inquiry , begins his book Kids These Days : Human Capital and the Making of Millennials . It ’ s a smart , contrarian look at the social and economic problems plaguing millennials — defined as people born between 1980 and 2000 .
But it ’ s not a typical defense of millennials . Harris , who is a millennial ( as am I ) , makes no attempt to undercut the complaints of baby boomers — namely , that millennials are anxious , spoiled , and narcissistic .
Instead , he asks : What made millennials the way they are ? Why are they so burned out ? Why are they having fewer kids ? Why are they getting married later ? Why are they obsessed with efficiency and technology ?
And his answer , in so many words , is the economy . Millennials , he argues , are bearing the brunt of the economic damage wrought by late-20th-century capitalism . All these insecurities — and the material conditions that produced them — have thrown millennials into a state of perpetual panic . If “ generations are characterized by crises , ” as Harris argues , then ours is the crisis of extreme capitalism .
I spoke to Harris about the case he lays out in the book , and why he thinks millennials will have to overthrow the system and rewrite the social contract if they want to meaningfully improves their lives — and the lives of future generations .
The core thesis of your book is that millennials were made , not born . So what are the major forces or institutions that made millennials what they are ?
Well , I take a very Marxist perspective on the world , so I ’ m looking at the dynamics of the labor market , the relationship between employers and the employed , basically the entire economic environment — these are the dominant forces shaping life in my view .
What I focused on is millennials as workers and the changing relationship between labor and capital during the time we all came of age and developed into people . If we want to understand why millennials are the way they are , then we have to look at the increased competition between workers , the increased isolation of workers from each other , the extreme individualism of modern American society , and the widespread problems of debt and economic security facing this generation .
The key variable you emphasize in the book is the divergence between productivity and compensation — or the fact that people are working harder while wages aren ’ t going up . Why is this such an important data point for you ? And how has it altered the day-to-day life of millennials ?
I think it ’ s crucial . Marxists would refer to this as an increase in the rate of exploitation , meaning workers are working longer , harder , and more efficiently but are receiving less and less in return . I reference Marxism here ( even though his name never appears in the book ) because conventional American economists don ’ t really have a term for this — it ’ s not something they like to talk about because they don ’ t recognize that capitalism is built on exploitation .
But it is a defining shift in our society , and millennials have been forced to grow up and enter the labor market under these dynamics , and we ’ ve internalized this drive to produce as much as we can for as little as possible . That means we take on the costs of training ourselves ( including student debt ) , we take on the costs of managing ourselves as freelancers or contract workers , because that ’ s what capital is looking for .
And because wages are stagnant and exploitation is up , competition among workers is up too . As individuals , the best thing we can do for ourselves is work harder , learn to code , etc . But we ’ re not individuals , not as far as bosses are concerned . The vast majority of us are ( replaceable ) workers , and by working harder for less , we ’ re undermining ourselves as a class . It ’ s a vicious cycle .
Class exploitation is hardly new , right ? That ’ s as old as capitalism . What is it about this moment that seems different to you ?
It ’ s a matter of scale , right ? The levels of inequality we ’ re seeing now are pretty extraordinary . One of the big things I allude to in the book is this question of human capital . The burdens of capital production have been shifted more and more onto workers and their families — they get fewer benefits and less support . The state helped with many of these things in the 1960s and ’ 70s , and before that , corporations actually picked up a lot of the slack .
But now you have individual workers , individual students , taking on this burden of making themselves into the workers the economy needs them to be and taking on all the expenses of that . Which is why so many millennials are drowning in so much student debt , while at the same time their educations are becoming less valuable in the market , which is hyper-competitive , heavily pro-business , and constantly changing .
Part of what you ’ re saying is that modern capitalism ( often referred to as “ neoliberalism ” ) has created a world in which everything is about competition and self-interest and productivity , and as a result , corporations are squeezing more out of workers and making it harder for individuals to even think of themselves as part of a community .
I mean , that ’ s what neoliberalism is , right ? We ’ re all individuals , not members of a class or a community . We ’ re all economic agents pursuing our self-interest . This is the basis of our whole society right now , and both Republicans and Democrats have signed on to it .
In the book , I talk about an Obama-era education policy that basically seeded this idea that education was all about job preparation . There was no other real justification for it . That puts you on a really dangerous course because that ’ s all about human capital production , and then you have a system where the schools set out to produce skills in children based on what people who own companies say they want those kids to have , what skills they ’ ll need from their workers .
So our entire lives are framed around becoming cheaper and more efficient economic instruments for capital . That , taken to an extreme , has pretty corrosive effects on society , particularly young people .
“ It ’ s not for me to say what must be done , but people can look at the world and decide for themselves ”
You talk a lot in the book about how millennials are burned out , that we ’ ve been conditioned to worship productivity and efficiency . Is that just a function of living in the cutthroat , hyper-competitive world you ’ re describing ?
I think that ’ s part of it . When I went into this project , I thought I was going to be very critical of helicopter parents , but then I realized that the parents doing this are doing it for pretty understandable reasons .
Most of these are working-class parents who are looking at an economy where the gap between the haves and the have-nots , between workers and capitalists , is growing bigger and bigger every day , and where the middle class is basically disappearing . So they feel like they have to give their kids the best shot they possibly can , just so they can catch up and not fall even further behind .
I ’ ll offer a little pushback here : One could read your book as saying that millennials were promised a version of the American dream and simply didn ’ t get it . Or someone might read this and say that you ’ re assuming a certain level of material comfort is a kind of birthright for Americans , when in reality that ’ s never been the case , particularly for nonwhite Americans .
Well , the promise that hard work will lead to a better life was definitely not just sold to white Americans . That has been sold to black Americans , to Hispanic Americans , to everyone . The American dream is not a product that is only sold to white people .
I ’ m not interested in arguing that millennials didn ’ t get what they were promised . It ’ s a question of exploitation . This is a fundamentally capitalist story . Workers have always been exploited , but that rate of exploitation — measured by the productivity wage gap we talked about earlier — is increasing exponentially for millennials .
Do you think millennials are at all complicit in their own fate ? After all , many of the economic forces — I ’ m thinking of Silicon Valley in particular — that are undermining our own happiness and security have been engineered by millennials .
Oh , absolutely . They ’ re exploiters like any other . They might even be better at it , in fact . When I talk about millennials , it ’ s not , like , a metaphor whereby millennials are the working class and boomers are the ruling class or something . The capitalist millennials are going to be just as bad , if not worse , than their predecessors , because they ’ ve inherited this exploitative system .
You write at the end of the book that history asks different things of different generations . What will it ask of millennials ?
That ’ s a great question , and one I ’ ve been thinking about a lot . I wish I had an answer at the end of the book , but I honestly didn ’ t — at least not a good one .
Well , to the extent that you ’ re right , I ’ d say we have to get out of this frame of generational conflict and think much bigger , but that opens up a whole new set of challenges .
I totally agree . The more I think about it , the more convinced I am that the historical task confronting us may be larger than we ever imagined . It may well be that America dies or the world dies , or that this global economic order dies or our problems just get worse .
So I want to make sure I ’ m clear on what you ’ re saying here . You ’ re essentially arguing that the system is fundamentally flawed and thus there is no ultimate solution short of overthrowing it . In other words , the only solution is revolution . But that ’ s a very difficult thing to control or predict .
It is . A much smarter Malcolm than I , Malcolm X , said you don ’ t have revolutions without bloodshed , and he was probably right . But we ’ re in a situation now where the ruling class feels so powerful and I ’ m not sure what it will take to change things .
I mean , we have thousands of Americans dead in Puerto Rico , and that ’ s an attack by the ruling class . You had all these vulture funds that swooped into Puerto Rico , threw them even deeper into debt , and eviscerated the public services , and people died because of it . That ’ s an attack by any definition .
It ’ s hard to read your book and not walk away with a sense of fatalism about our situation . Do you see no value in pushing for meaningful social change within the system ? Do you see any value in political movements that are seeking practical policy shifts that won ’ t overturn capitalism but might nevertheless reduce suffering ?
I definitely have a sense of fatalism about this system . I don ’ t think capitalism can last forever ( or even much longer ) , and I think if you asked a bunch of ecologists , they ’ d agree with me . That doesn ’ t mean what comes next will necessarily be better , but if by “ within this system ” you mean liberal capitalist democracy , then no , I don ’ t see any real strategic possibilities there .
That said , I ’ m not committed to only doing the most correct things . I voted for Hillary Clinton , I volunteer with groups in my neighborhood that are focused on harm reduction , etc . I ’ ve even helped put on a training for the DSA [ Democratic Socialists of America ] .
Revolution is hard , and that ’ s not an excuse not to participate in your community . But we have to be realistic about the possible near- and medium-term outcomes for this system , and there aren ’ t any good ones . We have to deal with capitalism soon , or it will deal with us .
The very last thing you say in the book is that millennials will have to become either fascists or revolutionaries . Is the choice really that binary ? Are you convinced revolution is the only answer , knowing all that that implies ?
Yes , is the very simple answer . It ’ s not for me to say what must be done , but people can look at the world and decide for themselves . What I can tell you now is that we appear to be running out of options for reform .","“If Millennials are different, it’s not because we’re more or less evolved than our parents or grandparents, it’s because they’ve changed the world in ways that have produced people like us.”

President Obama on Wednesday launched another effort to lay out his vision for how to strengthen the U.S. economy with a midday speech at Knox College in Galesburg , Ill. , in which he hit themes familiar to those who followed his 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns .
While focusing on issues such as the need to continue overhauling the nation 's health care system , to make education more affordable , to fix bridges and other infrastructure and to create solid , well-paying jobs , Obama also criticized those Republicans in Washington who he believes have been focused on `` political posturing and phony scandals . ''
We followed along and posted updates . Late this afternoon , Obama is due to speak in Warrensburg , Mo. , at the University of Central Missouri .
Update at 2:18 p.m . ET . At The End , Talk Of `` Yesterday 's Winds '' And Courage .
As he finishes , Obama quotes poet Carl Sandburg , who was born in Galesburg :
`` I speak of new cities and new people ... The past is a bucket of ashes ... yesterday is a wind gone down , a sun dropped in the west ... there is ... only an ocean of tomorrows , a sky of tomorrows . ''
`` America , '' Obama continues , `` we have made it through the worst of yesterday 's winds . We just have to have the courage to keep moving forward ; if we set our eyes on the horizon , we too will find an ocean of tomorrows , a sky of tomorrows – for America 's people , and for this great country that we love . ''
Update at 2:16 p.m . ET . What Makes The USA Special :
`` No matter who you are , what you look like , where you come from or who you love — you can make it if you try , '' Obama says .
The president says he cares `` about one thing and one thing only ... how to use every minute of the remaining 1,276 days of my term to make this country work for working Americans again . ''
After talking about reaching out to Republicans and criticizing them for only being against ideas rather than for them — things he also talked about a lot in the 2012 campaign — Obama has particularly sharp words about the several dozen times House Republicans have voted to eliminate `` Obamacare '' :
`` If you think you have a better plan for making sure every American has the security of quality , affordable health care , stop taking meaningless repeal votes and share your concrete ideas with the country . ''
Update at 2:02 p.m . ET . Big Cheer For Higher Minimum Wage :
`` Because no one who works full-time in America should have to live in poverty , '' Obama says , `` I will keep making the case that we need to raise the minimum wage because it 's lower right now than it was when Ronald Reagan took office . ''
That draws one of the biggest cheers from his audience .
The reason not to raise the minimum wage , say the president 's critics , is that doing so might make businesses less likely to add workers and more likely to send jobs overseas .
Update at 1:54 p.m . ET . Making It Easier To Refinance :
`` I 've asked Congress to pass a really good , bipartisan idea — one that was championed by Mitt Romney 's economic adviser , '' Obama says , `` and this is the idea to give every homeowner the chance to refinance their mortgage while rates are still low so they can save thousands of dollars a year . '' It would be like giving those homeowners a tax cut , he adds .
`` If you think education is expensive , wait until you see how much ignorance costs in the 21st century , '' Obama says while striking another theme he hit often in his presidential campaigns .
The president spends time in his address on subjects he talked about in the 2008 and 2012 campaigns — `` good jobs in wind , solar , and natural gas , '' rebuilding the nation 's infrastructure and how in `` an age when jobs know no borders , companies will also seek out the country that boasts the most talented citizens '' and reward them `` with good pay . ''
Update at 1:32 p.m . ET . `` Political Posturing And Phony Scandals '' :
`` With this endless parade of distractions , and political posturing and phony scandals , Washington 's taken its eye off the ball , '' Obama continues . `` And I am here to say this needs to stop . Short-term thinking and stale debates are not what this moment requires . Our focus must be on the basic economic issues that the matter most to you — the people we represent . ''
The president speaks of `` growing inequality , '' which he says `` is n't just morally wrong ; it 's bad economics . ''

President Obama on Wednesday launched another effort to lay out his vision for how to strengthen the U.S. economy with a midday speech at Knox College in Galesburg, Ill., in which he hit themes familiar to those who followed his 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns.

While focusing on issues such as the need to continue overhauling the nation's health care system, to make education more affordable, to fix bridges and other infrastructure and to create solid, well-paying jobs, Obama also criticized those Republicans in Washington who he believes have been focused on ""political posturing and phony scandals.""

We followed along and posted updates. Late this afternoon, Obama is due to speak in Warrensburg, Mo., at the University of Central Missouri.

Update at 2:18 p.m. ET. At The End, Talk Of ""Yesterday's Winds"" And Courage.

As he finishes, Obama quotes poet Carl Sandburg, who was born in Galesburg:

""I speak of new cities and new people ... The past is a bucket of ashes ... yesterday is a wind gone down, a sun dropped in the west ... there is ... only an ocean of tomorrows, a sky of tomorrows.""

""America,"" Obama continues, ""we have made it through the worst of yesterday's winds. We just have to have the courage to keep moving forward; if we set our eyes on the horizon, we too will find an ocean of tomorrows, a sky of tomorrows – for America's people, and for this great country that we love.""

Update at 2:16 p.m. ET. What Makes The USA Special:

""No matter who you are, what you look like, where you come from or who you love — you can make it if you try,"" Obama says.

Update at 2:14 p.m. ET. A Vow:

The president says he cares ""about one thing and one thing only ... how to use every minute of the remaining 1,276 days of my term to make this country work for working Americans again.""

Update at 2:08 p.m. ET. ""Meaningless Repeal Votes"":

After talking about reaching out to Republicans and criticizing them for only being against ideas rather than for them — things he also talked about a lot in the 2012 campaign — Obama has particularly sharp words about the several dozen times House Republicans have voted to eliminate ""Obamacare"":

""If you think you have a better plan for making sure every American has the security of quality, affordable health care, stop taking meaningless repeal votes and share your concrete ideas with the country.""

Update at 2:02 p.m. ET. Big Cheer For Higher Minimum Wage:

""Because no one who works full-time in America should have to live in poverty,"" Obama says, ""I will keep making the case that we need to raise the minimum wage because it's lower right now than it was when Ronald Reagan took office.""

That draws one of the biggest cheers from his audience.

The reason not to raise the minimum wage, say the president's critics, is that doing so might make businesses less likely to add workers and more likely to send jobs overseas.

Update at 1:54 p.m. ET. Making It Easier To Refinance:

""I've asked Congress to pass a really good, bipartisan idea — one that was championed by Mitt Romney's economic adviser,"" Obama says, ""and this is the idea to give every homeowner the chance to refinance their mortgage while rates are still low so they can save thousands of dollars a year."" It would be like giving those homeowners a tax cut, he adds.

Update at 1:47 p.m. ET. On Education:

""If you think education is expensive, wait until you see how much ignorance costs in the 21st century,"" Obama says while striking another theme he hit often in his presidential campaigns.

Update at 1:45 p.m. ET. Familiar Themes:

The president spends time in his address on subjects he talked about in the 2008 and 2012 campaigns — ""good jobs in wind, solar, and natural gas,"" rebuilding the nation's infrastructure and how in ""an age when jobs know no borders, companies will also seek out the country that boasts the most talented citizens"" and reward them ""with good pay.""

Update at 1:32 p.m. ET. ""Political Posturing And Phony Scandals"":

""With this endless parade of distractions, and political posturing and phony scandals, Washington's taken its eye off the ball,"" Obama continues. ""And I am here to say this needs to stop. Short-term thinking and stale debates are not what this moment requires. Our focus must be on the basic economic issues that the matter most to you — the people we represent.""

Update at 1:30 p.m. ET. Washington ""Made Things Worse"":

The president speaks of ""growing inequality,"" which he says ""isn't just morally wrong; it's bad economics.""

""Unfortunately, over the past couple of years in particular,"" he says, ""Washington hasn't just ignored this problem; too often, Washington's made things worse.""

Obama says that a ""sizable group of Republican lawmakers suggest they wouldn't vote to pay the very bills that Congress rang up — a fiasco that harmed a fragile recovery in 2011, and one we can't afford to repeat.""

Update at 1:25 p.m. ET. ""We're Not There Yet.""

Though he believes the economy is on the mend, Obama says: ""we're not there yet. Even though our businesses are creating new jobs and have broken record profits, nearly all the income gains of the past ten years have continued to flow to the top 1%. The average CEO has gotten a raise of nearly 40% since 2009, but the average American earns less than he or she did in 1999. And companies continue to hold back on hiring those who have been out of work for some time.""

Update at 1:20 p.m. ET. ""American Has Fought Its Way Back"":

After using the first few minutes of his address to run through the problems the economy was having when he took office, Obama says that ""today, five years after the start of that Great Recession, America has fought its way back.""

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are about 2.2 million more jobs on payrolls than when Obama took office. There are still, though, about 2.2 million fewer jobs than there were at the recent peak — January 2008 — shortly after the start of the last recession.

Interview Highlights

On protectionism versus free trade

Protectionism is a bad idea and obviously trade is a good thing. But I think we also have to recognize that, even though as a country we benefit from free trade, that there are people who have been victimized by trade and those are a lot of the people in these industrial Midwestern states. ...

On whether it's possible to make better deals with China without resorting to protectionism and raising tariffs

I guarantee you that Donald Trump is going to be a much tougher negotiator with China. Now how that turns out, I don't know. I believe that China's economy is highly dependent on the United States market and Donald Trump has made this point. Look, we have leverage over China. They need us probably more than we need them.

On whether China will have leverage over Trump since he has borrowed money from a Chinese bank and wants to do real estate deals there

No, I don't believe so. I think Donald Trump is going to put his business dealings aside. ... He must do that if he's going to be a successful president and I believe he will be. He has got to put his personal business concerns to the side and act in the national interest. And Americans are going to demand that.

There's no question about the fact that a lot of the jobs that have been lost are never coming back. [Auto production lines, for instance, are more automated.] And so, yes, of course things are different. But I do believe that we can bring factories and jobs and companies back to the United States with a better tax system and a better regulatory system.

Mccarthy","Sen. Elizabeth Warren speaks at the Presidential Gun Sense Forum in Des Moines , Iowa , August 10 , 2019 . ( Gage Skidmore )
Fortunes acquired through corruption and cronyism are bad ; not so for fortunes acquired through work and innovation .
With strong soak-the-rich rhetoric , Elizabeth Warren has surged in polls for the Democratic presidential nomination . She claims that “ billionaires have seized our government ” and that “ when you ’ ve got an economy that ’ s doing great for those with money and isn ’ t doing great for everyone else , that ’ s corruption , pure and simple. ” Bernie Sanders is also polling near the top of Democratic field by blasting wealth inequality as “ obscene ” and denouncing the economy as “ rigged ” by rich people .
Democrats are right that corruption or cronyism helps drive wealth inequality . Well-heeled interests do line their pockets from government spending and regulatory policies . Farm subsidies are classic cronyism : More than $ 20 billion a year in taxpayer money goes mainly to the wealthiest farmers , including even billionaires .
Federal sugar regulations benefit producers by imposing costs on consumers of up to $ 4 billion a year . The Fanjul family of Florida built an $ 8 billion fortune in the sugar industry based partly on their political ties to presidents and members of Congress . Such subsidy programs are “ wholesale ” cronyism . There is also “ retail ” cronyism , when particular individuals and businesses get rich by abusing the system . In a recent scandal , a Singapore-based tycoon known as “ Fat Leonard ” Francis cozied up to U.S. Navy leaders in the Pacific to win hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts to resupply Navy ships . He made large profits over many years by overpricing contracts and faking invoices . To steer contracts his way , Francis bribed officials with gifts , prostitutes , and other favors .
Solyndra is another prime example of retail cronyism . The Department of Energy gave the solar-panel maker a $ 535 million loan guarantee in 2009 . The company went bankrupt and taxpayers got hit with the cost . Why did Solyndra get a loan ? Because the White House pressed the department to approve it , since the company ’ s largest investor — billionaire George Kaiser — was a major fundraiser for Barack Obama .
So Warren and Sanders are right about corruption in Washington , which has likely increased over time . The federal government runs 2,300 different subsidy programs today , more than twice as many as in the 1980s . Over the same period , the number of pages of federal regulations has jumped by two-thirds to 180,000 . More programs and regulations mean more ways that special interests can line their pockets . And it means more high-paid lobbyists in D.C. , which is partly why the region boosts six of the ten highest-income counties in the nation .
But here ’ s the big mistake that Warren and Sanders make : Their rhetoric suggests that all top fortunes are ill-gotten , and all wealth inequality stem from cronyism . Based on that misguided view , they want to punish all wealthy people with an annual wealth tax — including the many entrepreneurs and philanthropists whose efforts help the poor .
What Warren and Sanders do not understand is that wealth inequality is not good or bad by itself — it entirely depends on what caused it . Inequality may reflect crony capitalism , or it may reflect innovation in a growing economy that is lifting all boats .
On the Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans , you find people such as Brian Acton and Jan Koum . They became billionaires by creating WhatsApp , which provides free phone service for 1.5 billion users globally . Their fortunes may have increased wealth inequality , but their product has produced massive value for consumers .
Acton and Koum are far from unique . Most of the billionaires on the Forbes list are self-made business people who have created real economic value . Most of the top wealth in the United States is earned in competitive industries , not from cronyism . Meanwhile , the share of people on the Forbes list who inherited their wealth has plunged from 60 percent in the 1980s to just 30 percent today . The broad-brush denunciations of wealth by Warren and Sanders would make more sense in countries such as Russia or Venezuela , where cronyism dominates . But the United States ranks as the 22nd least corrupt of 180 countries in Transparency International ’ s “ corruption perceptions index. ” And it ranks 25th least corrupt of 213 countries on the World Bank ’ s “ control of corruption index . ”
Using the Forbes list of international billionaires , Sutirtha Bagchi and Jan Svejnar separated the bad ones who got rich through political connections from the good ones who did not . Across countries other than the United States , they found that 17 percent were bad and 83 percent were good . But in the United States , just 1 percent were bad and 99 percent were good . By this metric , American billionaires overwhelmingly earned their wealth in productive and non-corrupt ways .
Finally , The Economist created a “ crony capitalism index ” using the Forbes list to estimate billionaire wealth in each country obtained from crony and non-crony activities . The United States is seventh least corrupt of 22 countries , and U.S. billionaire wealth earned in crony activities is only about one-sixth as large as that earned in non-crony activities . Warren and Sanders are wrong to paint most or all of top U.S. wealth as cronyist .
Nonetheless , there is room for improvement . Cronyism in Washington is an important problem that polls show Americans are very concerned about . The way to attack it is not to punish all wealthy people with damaging new taxes , but to eliminate the subsidies and regulations that fuel it .","Sen. Elizabeth Warren speaks at the Presidential Gun Sense Forum in Des Moines, Iowa, August 10, 2019. (Gage Skidmore)

So Warren and Sanders are right about corruption in Washington, which has likely increased over time. The federal government runs 2,300 different subsidy programs today, more than twice as many as in the 1980s. Over the same period, the number of pages of federal regulations has jumped by two-thirds to 180,000. More programs and regulations mean more ways that special interests can line their pockets. And it means more high-paid lobbyists in D.C., which is partly why the region boosts six of the ten highest-income counties in the nation.

But here’s the big mistake that Warren and Sanders make: Their rhetoric suggests that all top fortunes are ill-gotten, and all wealth inequality stem from cronyism. Based on that misguided view, they want to punish all wealthy people with an annual wealth tax — including the many entrepreneurs and philanthropists whose efforts help the poor.

What Warren and Sanders do not understand is that wealth inequality is not good or bad by itself — it entirely depends on what caused it. Inequality may reflect crony capitalism, or it may reflect innovation in a growing economy that is lifting all boats.

On the Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans, you find people such as Brian Acton and Jan Koum. They became billionaires by creating WhatsApp, which provides free phone service for 1.5 billion users globally. Their fortunes may have increased wealth inequality, but their product has produced massive value for consumers.

Acton and Koum are far from unique. Most of the billionaires on the Forbes list are self-made business people who have created real economic value. Most of the top wealth in the United States is earned in competitive industries, not from cronyism. Meanwhile, the share of people on the Forbes list who inherited their wealth has plunged from 60 percent in the 1980s to just 30 percent today. The broad-brush denunciations of wealth by Warren and Sanders would make more sense in countries such as Russia or Venezuela, where cronyism dominates. But the United States ranks as the 22nd least corrupt of 180 countries in Transparency International’s “corruption perceptions index.” And it ranks 25th least corrupt of 213 countries on the World Bank’s “control of corruption index.”

Using the Forbes list of international billionaires, Sutirtha Bagchi and Jan Svejnar separated the bad ones who got rich through political connections from the good ones who did not. Across countries other than the United States, they found that 17 percent were bad and 83 percent were good. But in the United States, just 1 percent were bad and 99 percent were good. By this metric, American billionaires overwhelmingly earned their wealth in productive and non-corrupt ways.

Finally, The Economist created a “crony capitalism index” using the Forbes list to estimate billionaire wealth in each country obtained from crony and non-crony activities. The United States is seventh least corrupt of 22 countries, and U.S. billionaire wealth earned in crony activities is only about one-sixth as large as that earned in non-crony activities. Warren and Sanders are wrong to paint most or all of top U.S. wealth as cronyist.

Nonetheless, there is room for improvement. Cronyism in Washington is an important problem that polls show Americans are very concerned about. The way to attack it is not to punish all wealthy people with damaging new taxes, but to eliminate the subsidies and regulations that fuel it.",www.nationalreview.com,right,Z8rHrVXgs28flL80

The American people never asked Congress to deregulate banking. Remember the Great Recession of 2008? It wasn’t our fault. We didn’t think up deregulating banks.

And finally, Americans never asked Congress to quadruple immigration. According to the Migration Policy Institute, immigrants and their children have added 81 million people to the U.S. population. Some immigration is good. But this number? Did we tell Congress: “Send more people! Please, help us! We’re too homogenous for our own good”? No, we never said those things.

So there it is, the globalist’s trifecta: the plan to build a borderless world based on the free flow of goods, people and capital. The globalist’s trifecta was sold to Congress by economists, academics and cheap-labor business lobbies as a plan to “make the economy grow.” And it did! Our gross national product has doubled since 1986.

But as economists are fond of saying: There are winners and losers. Bankers and investors – the 1 percent – grew obscenely rich. But wages for working Americans stagnated, good jobs vaporized, the middle class shrank and our infrastructure is crumbling from the weight of so many people.

The winners have done a masterful job of framing political discourse, convincing the leadership of both parties that America requires an incessant infusion of foreign labor.

Even in Maine, the globalist trifecta is shaping our political debates.

Example: Maine is shrinking. We need more people.

But the wages employers offer aren’t competitive. Our kids don’t stay, and millions of tourists who love Maine don’t settle here because they have better-paying jobs elsewhere.

The solution? We’re told that Maine needs immigrants to “make the economy grow.” And we’re told it over and over. See editorials in the Portland Press Herald and its sister papers, the Kennebec Journal and Morning Sentinel. And what makes immigrants special? Employers don’t have to compete with each other to attract these workers, as long as they convince Congress to continue expanding immigration.

And that’s why the Partnership for the New American Economy is feeding data to gullible journalists and shaping editorials all over America, including Maine, about the need to expand immigration, what they call “comprehensive reform.”

What is the Partnership? It’s a coalition of billionaires, corporate CEOs and their politicians. Their membership includes the CEOs of Facebook, AOL, Marriott, Hewlett-Packard, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Xerox and Morgan Stanley. Get the picture? The 1 percent on steroids.

As the richest and most privileged people in America, they know how to tell the story their way. Their website is a masterful ode to immigration, full of “facts” without links, and industry-funded “studies,” but nothing about costs or labor impacts.

Maine editorial writers frequently cite data from the Partnership website to support the “Maine needs immigrants” bandwagon. They’ve drunk the trifecta Kool-Aid.

But Maine editors largely swallowed the Partnership’s data and their “studies” on immigration without a blink. And like one big echo chamber, they nod their heads in perfect agreement, as though they were repeating an obvious truth.

Big Money isn’t satisfied with outsourcing good jobs, or storing huge profits in foreign banks to avoid taxes. They also want to reduce American wages and force all of us, immigrant and native-born, to compete against each other. Big Money sticks together. They don’t plan to compete with each other. And the 81 million already here is not enough for them. They want more. And more.

Yes, Maine faces a demographic transition. We need to think about it. But let’s think for ourselves. If employers want the benefits of doing business in America, access to our consumer markets and our infrastructure, then they need to offer livable wages. Unless they’re deprived of foreign workers, they won’t.
