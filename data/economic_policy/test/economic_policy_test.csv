Unemployment insurance is first partisan showdown in Congress for 2014

Republicans won't support measure without cuts elsewhere to offset the cost

Democrats are pushing the three-month package; President Obama supports it

With more than a dozen lawmakers absent due to travel delays caused by bad weather, the U.S. Senate postponed until Tuesday a key procedural vote on a politically charged proposal to extend long-term unemployment insurance affecting some 1.3 million Americans.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid received unanimous approval for a postponement from both parties just before the chamber was scheduled to hold the test vote on the first partisan showdown of the new year on Monday evening.

Backers of the bill to extend long-term unemployment benefits were nearing the 60 votes they need to clear the procedural vote.

Four Republicans said Monday they will join the 55 members of the Democratic caucus to vote to begin debate on the bill. But that's still one vote shy of the 60 votes needed to overcome a Republican filibuster.

GOP aides and senators differed on whether any other Republicans would vote for the measure.

The vote is scheduled for Tuesday at 10:30 a.m.

Big moments on Capitol Hill from here on out should be viewed through the lens of November's midterm elections, especially in the Senate, where Republicans are aiming to retake control.

Extending benefits is a political priority for congressional Democrats and President Barack Obama, who is trying to make income equality a centerpiece of his second term. Obama reached out to several GOP senators to try to persuade them to support the bill.

Many Republicans argue a $6.4 billion extension would hurt the economy and act as a disincentive to job creation. Others members of the GOP have signaled they might back an extension if the cost is offset elsewhere in the budget.

Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois, a Republican who often works across the aisle, got a call from Obama but missed it because he wasn't in the office. Kirk said he wants to help people but insisted Congress must find a way to pay for the measure.

""I, obviously, have people in my state who would benefit. The better way to go is to not add to the deficit in an irresponsible way,"" Kirk said.

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, is one of the four Republicans who said she would vote to begin debate on the bill. However, she wouldn't rule out blocking it later if cost offsets aren't added.

""I want us to get on the bill so we can talk about an offset to pay for it. Ultimately, I think we should restructure the unemployment compensation program so it's more closely linked to job training for the long-term unemployed whose jobs probably are not coming back,"" she said.

The other three Republicans are Dean Heller of Nevada, a co-sponsor of the bill, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire.

Democrats see themselves in a win-win position on the test vote. They could build momentum for the bill if Republicans back it. They get a political weapon if Republicans don't.

Seventeen senators absent

In remarks just before the vote was to have been held, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican, noted that 17 members were not in the chamber and urged that the proceedings be delayed ""so we can have a real debate"" and decide how to pay for the extension.

Republicans and Democrats alike were delayed by rough winter weather that plunged the Midwest and much of the South into a deep freeze, triggering widespread travel delays.

Sen. Lindsey Graham tweeted that his commuter flight to Washington returned to South Carolina shortly after takeoff due to a possible engine problem and made a safe emergency landing.

Benefits expired

Benefits for the long-term unemployed expired last month after Congress opted not to continue a 2008 recession-era law providing nearly a year of payments, footed by U.S. taxpayers, that kicked in when state jobless benefits ran out.

Democrats insist the program is critical to help Americans who are struggling and to maintain the economic recovery.

Republicans argue that the program -- which the Congressional Budget Office estimates would cost $26 billion to continue for another year -- is costly and is a disincentive to looking for work.

The U.S. unemployment rate stood at 7% in November, the most recent Labor Department statistics show. That means more than 10 million people were out of work, a third of them without a job for at least 27 weeks.

Over the weekend, key Republicans, including potential 2016 presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, insisted that an extension must include cuts elsewhere to offset the cost.

Obama supports passage

During his weekly address over the weekend, President Obama underscored that failing to pass an extension could result in a drag on the economy.

""It actually slows down the economy for all of us. If folks can't pay their bills or buy the basics, like food and clothes, local businesses take a hit and hire fewer workers,"" he said.

The Club for Growth urged all senators to vote ""no"" on the proposal and cited the lack of spending offsets.

The crowd sat mostly silent as a more subdued Trump spoke and offered a smattering of applause when he finished his speech.

While Trump is viewed as an outsider at Davos, the World Economic Forum host organization rolled out the red carpet to make sure the president felt honored and welcomed.

A Swiss band wearing military-style blue and red uniforms played music as Trump walked on stage.

During an impromptu Q&A session after the speech, World Economic Forum founder and Executive Chairman Klaus Schwab told Trump ""I’m aware that your strong leadership is open to misinterpretation and biased interpretations.”

That remark drew boos from the audience, and there were also boos when Trump criticized “fake news.”

During his speech, Trump sought to keep the focus on the economy.

New economic statistics released shortly after Trump’s speech showed the U.S. economy grew at a slower-than-expected 2.6 percent rate in the fourth quarter, partly because of a drag from trade.

That stopped a streak of quarters with 3 percent growth, though strong corporate demand and rising household sales also suggested a strong underlying economy.

Trump cited his overhaul of the nation’s tax code and efforts to cut regulations as examples of how his policies have energized the U.S. economy.

“America is open for business and we are competitive once again,” Trump said.

The president said 2.4 million jobs have been created since he was elected in November 2016 “and that number is going up very, very substantially,” citing companies like Apple that have pledged to move jobs to the U.S. because of the new tax law.

Trump said he wants to “negotiate mutually beneficial, bilateral trade agreements” with other countries — a shift away from sweeping, multi-national deals the U.S. has pursued in the past.

He also took a veiled swipe at China for its alleged theft of intellectual property and practice of forcing U.S. companies to turn over their intellectual property to do business there.

""We cannot have free and open trade if some countries exploit the system at the expense of others,” he said. “We support free trade, but it needs to be fair and it needs to be reciprocal.”

But the president also said he was open to negotiating multilateral trade agreements, including with members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) pact that Trump pulled out of last year.

He says those 1 percenters who oppose inequality do n't share views of populists
MacIntosh : Poor are n't poor because the rich are rich ; there are structural causes
He says wealthy should pay more in taxes but as part of a plan to invest in society 's future
Believe it or not , there are a fair number of people in the `` top 1 % '' who think that the existing distribution of wealth and opportunity is grotesque .
They believe that an American 's place in this distribution is too dependent on irrelevant factors ( race , creed , color , etc . ) and relevant ones ( educational attainment , intelligence ) ; that inequality is bad not only because poverty sucks and the wealthy can do more but also because it is corrupting fairness in politics , education , health , national service and employment .
They think it degrades social relationships , weakens national solidarity and drives the United States down international league tables in important areas . And these `` rich egalitarians '' believe that government can and should do far more to reduce inequality and mitigate its effects .
Rich egalitarians are often accused of weakness by the left for not voluntarily giving up more of their treasure , judged irrational by the right for not giving up their idealism ( in the interest of self-interest ) , and suspected of self-righteous hypocrisy by people who doubt that they sincerely want to reduce an inequality whose fruits they seem to enjoy very much .
Despite these attacks , for the last 20 years , it 's been pretty easy for rich egalitarians to live by following this simple playbook :
• In politics , vote for progressive Democrats , support progressive policies yet still sleep easy ( though with some guilt ) in the knowledge that even when Democrats are in power no policy truly hostile to the economic interests of the rich can pass ( e.g . the Buffett Rule or some other mechanism to tax capital gains sensibly and the `` carried interest '' earned by investment managers ) ; gnash teeth when the Republicans are in power ; generally ignore state and local politics .
• In philanthropy , give significant money and time to organizations working domestically with disadvantaged people or providing public goods available to everyone .

• In personal matters , eschew ostentation and the cloistered world of private planes and country clubs ; live a normal upper middle-class life , in a liberal city , of parks , subways and economy-class travel ( but private school for the children ) .
• In business , remain committed to the core public/private division of labor where private markets , technology and business provide innovation , efficiency and effectiveness while the government redistributes otherwise excessive outcomes ( through taxation and income support ) , mitigates ill effects ( through regulation ) and provides `` public '' goods such as education , parks , public transportation and health care as well as the core functions of the `` watchman '' state ( contract enforcement , rule of law , national security ) .
In politics , the emergence of the populist left poses a dilemma . Although they share some common policy ground , egalitarians believe in fairness ( everyone doing what they reasonably can and should ) while populists believe in taking ( from those fat cats ) . And remarkably , some populists seem to believe that we live in a neo-agrarian economy where the poor are poor because the rich are rich , whereas egalitarians see broader structural causes .
And rich egalitarians , while acknowledging that part of the policy remedy will require the rich become considerably poorer , also think it will require a long-term commitment to investments in education , health care , infrastructure and the other public goods .
So in New York , where rich egalitarians were originally heartened by new Mayor Bill de Blasio 's early focus on inequality , they now worry , given the tone of the inauguration , that he may prove to be a populist in egalitarian clothing who asks the wealthy , rightly , to do their fair share ( higher taxes to expand affordable housing and pre-K ) without asking others to do the same ( reforming arcane work rules and unsustainable benefits for public sector unions , etc . ) .
And it is easy to imagine something similar at the federal level if tax rates on the wealthy were increased without any of the structural changes -- increasing the total tax base , investing in public goods , curbing the growth in entitlements -- required to create a more egalitarian , yet fiscally sustainable , society .
Of course even rich egalitarians ca n't fully embrace a populist movement whose defining narrative tars the wealthy as villains , but should they nevertheless support the populists because of the short-term policy overlap , or abandon them on principle ?
In philanthropy , charities clamor more than ever for support while pundits tell the wealthy to discard `` band-aid charity '' to focus on `` solving '' problems through various types of `` impact '' investing ( where they might also make a buck ) .

He says those 1 percenters who oppose inequality don't share views of populists

MacIntosh: Poor aren't poor because the rich are rich; there are structural causes

He says wealthy should pay more in taxes but as part of a plan to invest in society's future

Believe it or not, there are a fair number of people in the ""top 1%"" who think that the existing distribution of wealth and opportunity is grotesque.

They believe that an American's place in this distribution is too dependent on irrelevant factors (race, creed, color, etc.) and relevant ones (educational attainment, intelligence); that inequality is bad not only because poverty sucks and the wealthy can do more but also because it is corrupting fairness in politics, education, health, national service and employment.

They think it degrades social relationships, weakens national solidarity and drives the United States down international league tables in important areas. And these ""rich egalitarians"" believe that government can and should do far more to reduce inequality and mitigate its effects.

John MacIntosh

Rich egalitarians are often accused of weakness by the left for not voluntarily giving up more of their treasure, judged irrational by the right for not giving up their idealism (in the interest of self-interest), and suspected of self-righteous hypocrisy by people who doubt that they sincerely want to reduce an inequality whose fruits they seem to enjoy very much.

Despite these attacks, for the last 20 years, it's been pretty easy for rich egalitarians to live by following this simple playbook:

• In politics, vote for progressive Democrats, support progressive policies yet still sleep easy (though with some guilt) in the knowledge that even when Democrats are in power no policy truly hostile to the economic interests of the rich can pass (e.g. the Buffett Rule or some other mechanism to tax capital gains sensibly and the ""carried interest"" earned by investment managers); gnash teeth when the Republicans are in power; generally ignore state and local politics.

• In philanthropy, give significant money and time to organizations working domestically with disadvantaged people or providing public goods available to everyone.

• In personal matters, eschew ostentation and the cloistered world of private planes and country clubs; live a normal upper middle-class life, in a liberal city, of parks, subways and economy-class travel (but private school for the children).

• In business, remain committed to the core public/private division of labor where private markets, technology and business provide innovation, efficiency and effectiveness while the government redistributes otherwise excessive outcomes (through taxation and income support), mitigates ill effects (through regulation) and provides ""public"" goods such as education, parks, public transportation and health care as well as the core functions of the ""watchman"" state (contract enforcement, rule of law, national security).

But across the board, rich egalitarians are being tested.

In politics, the emergence of the populist left poses a dilemma. Although they share some common policy ground, egalitarians believe in fairness (everyone doing what they reasonably can and should) while populists believe in taking (from those fat cats). And remarkably, some populists seem to believe that we live in a neo-agrarian economy where the poor are poor because the rich are rich, whereas egalitarians see broader structural causes.

And rich egalitarians, while acknowledging that part of the policy remedy will require the rich become considerably poorer, also think it will require a long-term commitment to investments in education, health care, infrastructure and the other public goods.

So in New York, where rich egalitarians were originally heartened by new Mayor Bill de Blasio's early focus on inequality, they now worry, given the tone of the inauguration, that he may prove to be a populist in egalitarian clothing who asks the wealthy, rightly, to do their fair share (higher taxes to expand affordable housing and pre-K) without asking others to do the same (reforming arcane work rules and unsustainable benefits for public sector unions, etc.).

And it is easy to imagine something similar at the federal level if tax rates on the wealthy were increased without any of the structural changes -- increasing the total tax base, investing in public goods, curbing the growth in entitlements -- required to create a more egalitarian, yet fiscally sustainable, society.

Of course even rich egalitarians can't fully embrace a populist movement whose defining narrative tars the wealthy as villains, but should they nevertheless support the populists because of the short-term policy overlap, or abandon them on principle?

In philanthropy, charities clamor more than ever for support while pundits tell the wealthy to discard ""band-aid charity"" to focus on ""solving"" problems through various types of ""impact"" investing (where they might also make a buck). But if charity is out and problem solving is in, shouldn't ""merely wealthy"" egalitarians cede that terrain to Gates, Buffett and other Giving Pledge billionaires with the individual resources to make a difference?

In personal life, the ""normal"" option -- just fine in the past -- continues to be hollowed out to make room for an ever-expanding set of gold and platinum tiers that are becoming the norm not only in credit cards and air travel but everywhere ($315/hour Disney VIP Tours anyone?).

Worse yet, the bar rises each year with respect to what wealthy children see as ""normal"" given the increasingly perverse lengths to which many parents will go in the attempt to lock in high socioeconomic status by turning their children's lives into grueling, yet luxurious, 17-year, all-expenses paid, Ivy League applications. Does the commitment of rich egalitarians to a ""normal"" life require explicit acts of self-sacrifice and restraint on a daily basis?

And in business, the debacles of the last decade -- gun control, insider trading, the financial crisis, Blackwater, etc. -- force rich egalitarians to question whether their commitment to markets/technology/business has become anachronistic in an era where business seems incapable of self-regulation while relentlessly absorbing hitherto public goods and defeating even sensible efforts at regulation. (And in the absence of campaign finance reform, rich nonegalitarians are now free to use their de facto control of corporate assets to fight against redistribution on the personal side as well.)

But since rich egalitarians can't abandon the commitment to the market ( rich egalitarians are not socialists), should they pin their hopes on nascent forms of ""social enterprise"" that are far from proving they can deliver the goods?

The government taxed the wealthy over 90 percent and unions became powerful organizations demanding a fair share for workers . It was a period that progressive economist Paul Krugman has always been quick to praise , writing in his 2009 book , `` The Conscience of a Liberal '' :
`` The political and economic environment of my youth stands revealed as a paradise lost , an exceptional moment in our nation ’ s history . ''
This period , which can be called the Keynesian era , was indeed a time of great economic growth and increased economic equality . Looking back today , it does seem like an exceptional time to be in the working class . ( As long as you were white , of course . ) It was an age of compromise , between the capitalist class and the working class , and perhaps the most democratic period in our liberal capitalist society . During that epoch , it certainly looked as though a form of socialism was on the horizon , with the middle class growing and forming a previously unimaginable kind of egalitarian society within capitalism .
But of course , it was not to be . By the '70s , the economy had seemingly become diseased , with both inflation and stagnation , or what was coined stagflation . At the time , most economists were dumbfounded . In neoclassical theory , inflation and recession were opposites , they did not happen simultaneously . Hence the monetary policy of low interest rates during a recession , and high interest rates during a period of high inflation .
Today , we can pinpoint certain causes for what happened during the '70s . The most obvious is , of course , the energy crisis , which happened in 1973 , after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries declared an oil embargo on America and other developed nations because of their support of Israel in the Yom Kippur War . This sparked a 400 percent increase in the price of oil , affecting the entire economy .
Another important consideration for its failure is the very nature of a Keynesian economy , which promotes low unemployment and higher wages . During the Keynesian period ( 1945-1970s ) , unions had created a strong workforce , which forced capitalists to give in to higher wages , and likely contributing to the high inflation plague . And , of course , Nixon ’ s dismantling of the Bretton Woods System , which had fixed the international exchange rate to the dollar , and the dollar to gold , created floating currencies , which did not help currency stability .
The stagflation crisis , along with increasing globalization , created an opening for the capitalist class , who embraced the thinking of Milton Friedman . The crisis of Keynesianism created a wave of propaganda , which ultimately resulted in the election of Ronald Reagan . At the same time , the high interest rate policies of Fed chairman Paul Volcker attacked inflation head on , and drove the American economy into a deep recession , while undermining the working class . To top this off , the major tax cuts for the wealthy and the war on unions during the Reagan presidency dismantled what was left of the Keynesian-era middle class .
But while all of these policies certainly sped up the destruction of America 's working class , what may have truly sealed its fate was globalization and technological progress . To see how much these phenomena hurt the working class , one only has to look at America 's employment history in manufacturing compared to finance . During the post-WWII period , manufacturing accounted for 50 percent of domestic corporate profits and 30 percent of American employment , while the financial industry accounted for 10 percent of profits , and less than 5 percent of employment . Since then , profits for these industries have reversed ; manufacturing accounted for about 10 percent of profits in the early 2000s , but have since recovered to nearly 20 percent , while the financial industry reached a high of 40 percent before the financial crisis , and is closer to 30 percent today . What is even more telling is the number of jobs each industry produces : Today , manufacturing accounts for less than 10 percent , while finance still hovers around 5 percent . So while the financial industries profits have jumped , its share of employment has hardly grown at all .
America ’ s economy has gone through a deindustrialization period , largely replacing its domestic manufacturing with a financialization . And this has created the enormous inequality we have today . While our economy has grown steadily since the '80s , most of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent , and China has taken over as the largest manufacturer in the world .
The Keynesian period was a time of compromise , but within a capitalist system , a compromise can only last for so long . The American middle class has since been hollowed out , while the epoch of neoliberalism created irreversible environmental damage .
So , is a return to a Keynesian compromise the answer , as economists like Krugman believe ? After the financial crisis , there was a resurgence of fiscal policies that Keynes promoted to combat the recession -- and there can be no doubt that the stimulus policy that America implemented helped the economy recover faster than the European economy , where rigid austerity has plagued several members of eurozone . It has also been reported that the stimulus policy erased most of the middle-class income loss in the recession . But these stimulus policies did not encourage any sort of compromise between capitalists and workers , and the globalized free market will make it quite impossible to return to the sort of compromise of the post-WWII period .
The problems seem to be systemic within capitalism . First of all , unions have been completely gutted by the capitalist class over the past 40 years , thanks to globalization and the aforementioned war on unions . Fifty years ago , one in three workers were union members , and today the number is just one in 10 . This was natural reaction from the capitalist class , and there is little hope that unions will ever regain the strength they once possessed . But even more important , if we look at the era of great Keynesian compromise that many progressives want to emulate , evidence points to it being more of an anomaly than a natural outcome of capitalism .
Indeed , the strong middle class was most certainly a rarity of capitalism , and today our social structure is simply returning to form . While the middle class was assisted by government policies ( i.e . regulation , progressive taxation , union support ) , a major contributing factor in Americas flourishing middle class was the second World War . As Thomas Piketty ’ s book “ Capital in the Twenty-first Century ” pointed out , the mass destruction of capital around the world created a much more even playing field than before , while also placing the United States at the forefront of the world economy . It was an era that some call the Golden Age of Capitalism ; a time of global rebuilding and worldwide economic growth , supported by the American working class .
But today is a very different world . Capitalism has defeated communism and spread worldwide . The globalized economy gives all of the cards to the capitalist class , and there is no reason for them to form another Keynesian type of compromise .
The threat of communism was another reason for the capitalist system to become fairer -- to weaken support for radical socialists , and provide the working class a reason to accept capitalism over the alternative . FDR was quite aware of this , as he once wrote in a letter : “ No question in my mind that it is time for the country to become fairly radical for at least one generation . History shows us that where this occurs , occasionally , nations are saved from revolutions . ”
The threat of a socialist overthrow of capitalism was very real during that period , when inequality and desperation were great -- and a Keynesian compromise was necessary to prevent the rise of socialism within America . WWII happened to also provide great opportunity for the rise of a middle class . But that period is now long gone , as is the major ideological challenge of communism .
And if we continue to move in the same direction we have been for 40 years , which neither Barack Obama nor Hillary Clinton seem legitimately opposed to ( think of the TPP ) , and Republicans wholeheartedly support , then our future will indeed become a new global Gilded Age .
That is , of course , unless the left becomes fairly ( or fully ) radical , as FDR once suggested . And the rise of Elizabeth Warren perhaps shows that there is enough discontent for a new radical movement to form . The capitalist class does not want a compromise , so why not fight it head on ? It has done the same to the middle class over the past four decades , after all . Match the neoliberal movement with a neo-radical movement -- a call for true democracy , rather than the plutocratic democracy that we currently have .
Rather than fighting for a return to a Keynesian compromise , the left should be considering how to create a new 21st century workers movement . Unfortunately , globalization has strengthened the capitalist class , and workers movements can no longer be purely domestic issues ; they must be international . Breaking up too-big-to-fail banks and fighting for more worker control should not be off-limit goals .

Warren would forgive up to $ 50,000 for most people . Sanders would go further with total loan forgiveness . But with these plans having a price tag north of $ 1 trillion , such legislation would come with plenty of risks .
The reason debt forgiveness could have a big impact on the overall economy is that a generation of Americans is making major life decisions differently because of student loans .
`` Children , it 's not about if you want them , '' says Laura Greenwood in Montpelier , Vt. `` It 's about can you afford them ? ''
Greenwood works for the state education agency . She 's 30 years old and makes $ 63,000 a year . `` I make probably a better salary than a lot of my peers . ''

It 's always , we 're interested in having kids , but just cost of living and all our other bills and then the student loans , it 's just like the final straw .

So if people like Greenwood suddenly had this millstone of debt lifted from their necks , it stands to reason that would unleash pent-up desires and spending that would be good for the economy . A lot more people would have kids , or start businesses , or buy houses .
`` In the short term , it would be very positive for the housing market , '' says Lawrence Yun , the National Association of Realtors chief economist . He says his group 's surveys show that student debt has people delaying homeownership by five to seven years .
He 's not endorsing any particular plan , but he estimates that broad loan forgiveness would push up the number of home sales quite a bit . `` Home sales could be , say , 300,000 higher annually if people were not saddled with large student debt . '' Yun says that would be `` a boost to the housing sector as well as the economy . ''
The effects would go beyond the housing market . William Foster is a vice president with Moody 's , which just did a report on student debt forgiveness . `` There 've been some estimates that U.S. real GDP could be boosted on average by $ 86 billion to $ 108 billion per year , '' which is `` quite a bit , '' he says . `` That 's if you had total loan forgiveness . '' Foster says it would n't have to be total forgiveness to see significant results . And he says it could also help address rising income inequality .
`` Student loans are now contributing to what 's perceived as lower economic prospects for younger Americans , '' Foster says . After all — millions of people are delaying homeownership . And that 's the most powerful way for most working and middle class people to build wealth .
`` A typical homeowner has net worth about $ 230,000 , while a typical renter has only $ 5,000 , '' Yun says .
But while the idea of loan forgiveness is enticing , it would not be free . And this is a big reason plenty of politicians and policy experts are not on board . This would be expensive . Foster says Americans owe a lot of money on those student loans . `` About 1.5 trillion . And that 's more than auto loans and credit cards . They 're the second-biggest debt item for households . ''
Foster says most of these loans are from the federal government , and it could forgive them . But that would mean giving up the $ 85 billion in annual revenue it 's currently collecting on these loans . And , he says , `` That would result in a wider fiscal deficit . ''
Also , taxing people to make up the difference would be a drag on the economy . Economists say whether the boost from the stimulus of debt forgiveness was stronger than the drag from raising the revenue another way would depend on the details of the legislation should it come about .
And there are other issues . Many people would oppose a giveaway to , say , lawyers and doctors who stand to make a lot of money in the future but happen to have a lot of student loan debt . And you probably would n't want to tax the working class to pay for higher-income college graduates ' loan forgiveness . That 's why presidential candidates are proposing to tax the wealthy to pay for it — which , by the way , Foster says would also create less drag on the economy from the taxes because wealthy people 's spending patterns are less influenced by such changes than people in lower income brackets .
Foster says there could also be what 's called a moral hazard factor here for future students . `` Those students might expect future loan forgiveness and therefore they 'll take out even more money than they might have otherwise . ''
That could create even greater levels of student debt . So there are plenty of potential pitfalls in all this . But policymakers who are pushing for loan forgiveness say they have plans to make it both fair and good for the economy and to do it in a way to make education more affordable for future students so they would n't have to take on so much debt .","Forgiving Student Debt Would Boost Economy, Economists Say

""In the short term, it would be very positive for the housing market,"" says Lawrence Yun, the National Association of Realtors chief economist. He says his group's surveys show that student debt has people delaying homeownership by five to seven years.

He's not endorsing any particular plan, but he estimates that broad loan forgiveness would push up the number of home sales quite a bit. ""Home sales could be, say, 300,000 higher annually if people were not saddled with large student debt."" Yun says that would be ""a boost to the housing sector as well as the economy.""

The effects would go beyond the housing market. William Foster is a vice president with Moody's, which just did a report on student debt forgiveness. ""There've been some estimates that U.S. real GDP could be boosted on average by $86 billion to $108 billion per year,"" which is ""quite a bit,"" he says. ""That's if you had total loan forgiveness."" Foster says it wouldn't have to be total forgiveness to see significant results. And he says it could also help address rising income inequality.

""Student loans are now contributing to what's perceived as lower economic prospects for younger Americans,"" Foster says. After all — millions of people are delaying homeownership. And that's the most powerful way for most working and middle class people to build wealth.

""A typical homeowner has net worth about $230,000, while a typical renter has only $5,000,"" Yun says.

But while the idea of loan forgiveness is enticing, it would not be free. And this is a big reason plenty of politicians and policy experts are not on board. This would be expensive. Foster says Americans owe a lot of money on those student loans. ""About 1.5 trillion. And that's more than auto loans and credit cards. They're the second-biggest debt item for households.""

Foster says most of these loans are from the federal government, and it could forgive them. But that would mean giving up the $85 billion in annual revenue it's currently collecting on these loans. And, he says, ""That would result in a wider fiscal deficit.""

Also, taxing people to make up the difference would be a drag on the economy. Economists say whether the boost from the stimulus of debt forgiveness was stronger than the drag from raising the revenue another way would depend on the details of the legislation should it come about.

And there are other issues. Many people would oppose a giveaway to, say, lawyers and doctors who stand to make a lot of money in the future but happen to have a lot of student loan debt. And you probably wouldn't want to tax the working class to pay for higher-income college graduates' loan forgiveness. That's why presidential candidates are proposing to tax the wealthy to pay for it — which, by the way, Foster says would also create less drag on the economy from the taxes because wealthy people's spending patterns are less influenced by such changes than people in lower income brackets.

Foster says there could also be what's called a moral hazard factor here for future students. ""Those students might expect future loan forgiveness and therefore they'll take out even more money than they might have otherwise.""

That could create even greater levels of student debt. So there are plenty of potential pitfalls in all this. But policymakers who are pushing for loan forgiveness say they have plans to make it both fair and good for the economy and to do it in a way to make education more affordable for future students so they wouldn't have to take on so much debt.",www.npr.org,center,NIkjSzzrW2Q7h3T0
economic_policy,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2019/1/7/18167691/what-is-socialism-capitalism-sanders-warren,Is America’s future capitalist or socialist?,2019-01-07,"Ezra Klein, Bhaskar Sunkara, Steve Pearlstein, Illustrations Christina Animashaun","As 2018 drew to a close , Steve Pearlstein , the Washington Post ’ s Pulitzer Prize-winning business columnist , published a book that would ’ ve been bizarre only a few years before . It ’ s called Can American Capitalism Survive ? and it begins by laying bare the ideological crisis facing the economic system and , just as importantly , the economic philosophy that many Americans take for granted :
A decade ago , 80 percent of Americans agreed with the statement that a free market economy is the best system . Today , it is 60 percent , lower than in China . One recent poll found that only 42 percent of millennials supported capitalism . In another , a majority of millennials said they would rather live in a socialist country than a capitalist one .
In 2016 , Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders ran on a platform that many thought would ’ ve ruined his political chances . He ran as a democratic socialist , disavowing America ’ s longtime capitalist consensus and proudly wrapping himself in a label pundits considered political poison . And it worked .
In American politics , and particularly in the Democratic Party , the primacy of capitalism is , for the first time in ages , an open question . Sanders is expected to run again in 2020 , and to run with the support of a grassroots movement that thrills to his break with capitalist convention . He ’ ll face , among others , Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , who says one key difference between her and Sanders is that she ’ s “ a capitalist to my bones . ”
But what are the actual differences between liberal reformers of capitalism , like Warren and Pearlstein , and democratic socialists , like Sanders ? I invited Pearlstein to discuss his book , and the broader capitalism vs. socialism divide , with Bhaskar Sunkara , editor of the journal Jacobin , and author of the forthcoming book , The Socialist Manifesto . Their debate follows , lightly edited for style and length , with Sunkara kicking off the conversation .
I just finished reading two interesting tracts this weekend , the White House Council of Economic Advisers ’ ” The Opportunity Costs of Socialism ” report and your new book Can American Capitalism Survive ?
Yours was better , don ’ t worry . But it strikes me as fascinating that “ capitalism ” and “ socialism ” are back in the popular discussion .
You come down firmly on the capitalist side , but see the need for major changes . In your view , old-school liberal models ( heavily regulatory , skeptical of consolidation , buttressed by powerful unions that made expansive wage and benefit demands ) encouraged stagnation and made American companies less competitive internationally .
But the neoliberal correction that came — mantras that emphasized that government could do no good , that businesses were bound by no other purpose than maximizing investor returns , and that any market outcome was just — was a radical overcorrection . It ’ s helped fuel a backlash that is threatening the foundations of the system itself .
I ’ m a socialist , so I ’ m bound to disagree with some of your proposed solutions to the problem : employee profit-sharing , renewed but not stifling regulatory oversight , getting corporate money out of politics . I obviously don ’ t think this goes far enough .
However , I ’ m interested in starting this conversation with our different views about the crisis of the 1970s and what drove the shift to supply-side economics . Unlike some liberals , I don ’ t deny that there was actually a crisis in the 1970s : corporations couldn ’ t keep up with militant union demands , the after-effect of the OPEC oil shock , and increased international competition . Profitability sagged .
But from your book , I noticed that you have a much bigger role for ideology than I do . In my account , without a broader ideological agenda , capital knew that it had to restructure to restore profitability . It saw regulations and strong unions as impediments to this goal . Neoliberal ideology seems to just follow these developments but not play a very important role in and of itself .
I also question whether there was actually a different mentality that pervaded capitalism during the postwar boom years . A CEO like Charles Wilson could say “ what was good for the country was good for General Motors and vice versa , ” but he was responding to the same exact market pressures as CEOs today . The only difference is that he was constrained by unions and a liberal political coalition .
Social democracy was always predicated on economic expansion . Expansion gave succor to both the working class and capital . When growth slowed and the demands of workers made deeper inroads into firm profits , business owners rebelled against the class compromise . And they were in the structural position to force their own solutions , even in countries like Sweden where there were experiments with wage-earner funds and other left-solutions to the crisis .
It seems to me that the goal isn ’ t to defeat neoliberal ideology , but rather to try to recreate the working-class political movements that help make shared prosperity possible . And that means heightening polarization — between working people and corporate interests — from the left and trying to build the kind of political movements that might be able to resolve the “ next crisis of the 1970s ” in a more radical direction .
Actually , we don ’ t disagree much about the genesis of the turn toward more market-friendly policies in the 1980s . I do think there were a set of ideas ( as distinct from a well-honed ideology ) were part of that transformation , but the driving force was the pressing need to restore the competitiveness of the US economy , that was seriously challenged from Japan and Europe at that time .
Ideas are important at such moments because those participating in the policy and political debates need a rationale to convince the country that disruptive change is necessary . That process often involves shedding old ideas that were useful and we thought were true in favor of other ideas that are useful and true . In the political marketplace , ideas matter in terms of the outcome , even if they were not the driving force . That ’ s different than saying that ideology or some ideological movement played a starring role .
So in the book , I lay out several of those ideas and why they are have been pushed so far that they are no longer useful or valid .
The first is that greed is good and necessary for the workings of a market system , which now has been codified in the notion that businesses must be run to maximize return to shareholders .
The second is that market incomes are an objective measure of each person ’ s economic contribution — marginal utility , in the language of economics .
The third idea is that we don ’ t need to worry about the level of income inequality because all that really matters , at least in terms of morality and fairness , is equality of opportunity .
And the fourth idea is that there is an absolute tradeoff between economic equality and economic efficiency — that if we want more equal slices , then we will have to accept the reality that the pie ( and thus each slice ) will be smaller .
These ideas now form the core of what might be called “ market fundamentalism , ” and explain why so many of your generation feel that capitalism has lost its moral legitimacy .
One theme running through the book is the importance of social norms . Social norms are very powerful in shaping how individuals and businesses behave . And while you apparently resist this idea , norms have changed a lot since the 1950s and ’ 60s . In those days , businesses were indeed run with a broader purpose in mind , and executives who violated those norms were shunned not just by workers or customers or citizens in the local community , but by other executives and financiers .
White-shoe law firms and investment banks just didn ’ t do hostile takeovers . Executives didn ’ t pay themselves enormous salaries . Very profitable companies shared those profits with all of their workers . Companies were loyal to their workers and expected loyalty in return . And that was true , by the way , at unionized and non-unionized companies .
There was a historical basis for these norms . We had just come out of wartime experience of shared sacrifice in which men of all types served with each other on the battlefield , and women of all types had worked side by side in factories and offices , and many essential goods were rationed equally to each household .
This shared experience was based on norms of equality , cooperation , trust . The idea that the only reason executives and businesses behaved in that way was because they were forced to by unions and a liberal political coalition is just wrong , although it is surely true that unions and liberal-minded voters and special interests had a hand in helping to shape those norms . And then norms changed .
How powerful are social norms ? Well , just look at the # MeToo movement , a wonderful example of a changing social norm . What used to be accepted and tolerated no longer is . This has been a bottom-up process that nobody anticipated and nobody controls . In terms of the power structure , which you like to focus on , very little changed other than public opinion .
The language with which you talk about these things , Bhaskar — framing things in terms of movements and ideologies and well-defined classes and interests — inevitably causes you to see things through a distorting lens . My goal is not to “ defeat ” any ideology , neoliberal or otherwise . Nor do I think it necessary to “ recreate a working-class political movement , ” which would be hard because , in America , we never really had one in the first place . What exactly do you have in mind — bookkeepers and baristas and computer technicians meeting in cells to plan general strikes and marches on the US Chamber of Commerce ?
Our goal should be : Use all the tools available in a democratic society to convince a broad swath of the public — frontline workers , middle managers , professionals , executives , academics , journalists — that certain types of business behavior are no longer socially acceptable .
Unacceptable because they offend our moral sensibilities . Unacceptable because they are economically counterproductive . And unacceptable because they erode the trust and cooperation that are necessary for a successful capitalism , and a successful democracy .
Change the social norms in that way and the rules and laws naturally follow . That ’ s a goal that is more likely to be achieved , and more likely to be effective , than trying to change things by grabbing power and shoving a different set of rules and norms down everyone ’ s throats .
I think we ’ re looking far differently at not only how to change what ’ s rotten in the United States today , but also how we ’ ve won improvements in the past . You say that our country has never really had a “ working-class political movement , ” but we do have a long history of labor turmoil — not just on the shopfloor , but wider movements for the eight-hour-day and the mass unionization drives of the 1930s and efforts to expand social protections .
It was the power of trade unions and the political culture that emerged out of them that helped ensure that the prosperity of the postwar period was more widely shared .
What I have in mind for the future is quite simple : people banding together to defend their common interests through politics . We ’ re just a couple years removed from 13 million Americans voting for a self-described democratic socialist , someone who said that people deserve more than they ’ re getting and “ millionaires and billionaires ” were to blame .
Today , most Americans support Medicare-for-all , jobs programs , and other social-democratic policies . As they try to get these things , they ’ re going to run up against the power of those who benefit from the status quo . That ’ s not the resistance of social norms , it ’ s the resistance of segments of capital — it ’ s class struggle in the most classical sense .
Norms will follow those organizing efforts and conditions on the ground , and help consolidate gains , but I think you ’ re overstating their importance . There are powerful segments of business that existentially oppose things like Medicare-for-all and increased unionization , not as individual traits but to preserve their livelihoods . I don ’ t think the same can be said for # MeToo and other important struggles against sexism .
Concretely , I think that means broad-based left electoral campaigns , combined with new trade union organizing efforts in strategically positioned sectors — the year ’ s wave of teacher strikes , new efforts to rally nurses and those in supply and logistics , for example , and social movements for things like criminal justice , health care , and affordable housing .
The words of A. Philip Randolph still seem apt to me : “ At the banquet table of nature there are no reserved seats . You get what you can take , and you keep what you can hold . If you can ’ t take anything , you won ’ t get anything ; and if you can ’ t hold anything , you won ’ t keep anything . ”
Every past advance — from the end of slavery to the creation of even our rudimentary welfare state — has come through struggle . The world and politics have changed , but I see no reason why the future will be any different .
If the left doesn ’ t speak to anger and try to “ grab power ” ( and by that I mean win a majority ) for our agenda , it ’ ll only benefit the xenophobes and scaremongers of the right .
Who would disagree with your idea of people banding together to defend their common interests through politics ? But I think you are kidding yourself that the forces protecting the status quo are just millionaires and billionaires , and that all the rest of us are victims of the oppressive economic system they have imposed on us , or hoodwinked us into embracing .
That ’ s not to say the special interests , including business interests , don ’ t have disproportionate political and economic power . Of course they do . But there are all sorts of other special interests that I think you would recognize as mostly middle class in nature that have also shaped our system — like the ability to buy cheap goods from abroad or subsidies for homeownership .
Ours is still a largely middle-class country , with standards of living that are equal to or exceed that of most other countries in the world . And these middle-class Americans wouldn ’ t favor Medicare-for-all , particularly if you explained to them what it would really mean , or 90 percent marginal tax rates on the super-rich , or guaranteed jobs or free public higher education . There is probably a bit more inner socialism the typical American can discover , but not as much as you imagine . Many are as distrustful of government as they are of Wall Street or large corporations .
How about let ’ s start with fixing the capitalism we have — or as Raghuram Rajan and Luigi Zingales cleverly put it , saving capitalism from the capitalists . As I outlined in the book , I would start by getting money out of politics — corporate money but also union money . And ending the stranglehold Wall Street has put on the real economy be demanding companies be run to maximize shareholder value . And more vigorous antitrust enforcement to deal with old-fashioned consolidation and the natural winner-take-all tendencies of the new economy . We need to bring back a serious inheritance tax , a serious and reformed corporate tax and a top marginal income tax of 40 percent .
And while we are at it , why not create a new set of financial institutions — banks , insurance companies , mutual funds and pension funds — that are owned by their customers rather than by shareholders . Even a capitalist can understand the logic of an annual “ dividend ” for every American as his or her share of the nation ’ s natural and institutional bounty , particularly if it is combined with an obligation for three years of national service ( my version of universal basic income ) .
Want to get really radical ? How about ending school segregation by class the way we did with segregation by race , through enlarged school districts , magnet schools , and creative use of school choice .
I ’ m all for making it possible once again to organize a union without getting fired or spending the next decade in court , which unfortunately is the current reality . But there may be other , better ways to reinvigorate the union movement and give a bit more power to workers in a post-industrial economy . My guess is that many American workers don ’ t want the kind of union you pine for — the ones that undermined the competitive viability of their companies , the ones that rejected all pay for performance schemes and saddled companies with rigid work rules .
Maybe in a more professional , service , and tech-oriented economy , people would prefer unions that focused on providing services to their members ( pensions , health insurance , legal advice ) or providing mechanisms for them to have a greater voice in how their companies are run .
You are right that the teacher strikes have been as inspiring as they have been effective , but so has the # MeToo movement , which changed corporate behavior without unions or strikes but through public exposure and moral suasion .
The problem with your preferred model of permanent class struggle is that it ignores the importance of social capital — the trust in each other and in our common institutions — in much the same way that our current version of American capitalism does , with its ruthlessness , its inequality , and its celebration of greed and indifference .
Economic and political systems work best when there is a sense of shared purpose , shared sacrifice , and shared success , when people feel as if we are all in it together . But permanent class struggle , I fear , would discourage cooperation and erode trust — within firms , within communities , within countries .
Your reply gets a fundamental difference between us : You seem to think that the state is neutral and simply responds to the demands of different special interests . So in the past , when labor was strong , labor made unreasonable demands on the state and now today big corporations do the same .
But even if you took away corporate lobbying and got “ money out of politics ” through publicly funded elections and elected figures like Bernie Sanders to high office , the state would still have a built-in bias . It relies on revenue to fund itself , and that revenue comes almost entirely from the activities of private capitalists . As long as capitalists have the power to withhold investment , a minority of people will hold tremendous sway and our democracy will be undermined .
Were people hoodwinked into embracing a system like this ? No , workers and capitalists are dependent on each other . Workers need their firms to be profitable , and that recognition has always tempered demands . But it ’ s an asymmetrical dependency : Workers need their jobs more than capitalists needs any individual worker .
Political democracy , won over the wishes of elites , has created avenues to improve the lot of working people through legislation and unions ( whose power rests most fundamentally in the ability of people to go on strike and withhold their labor ) , and that ’ s evened the odds a bit , but that inequality hasn ’ t gone away .
Along the same lines , your definition of “ middle class ” seems mythical to me . Who are these middle-class Americans ? Is it a nurse working double shifts , a bartender who saved up enough for a house and a car , or is it just highly educated professionals ? If you ’ re making these definitions based on just income level you ’ re missing the important difference in status and relationships to between that of a well-paid unionized worker and a small business owner that might be earning the same . And if you don ’ t get that difference , you don ’ t get why the former has to organize collectively to make gains .
And finally , of course , I want to encourage cooperation and trust . I just want to do so through resurrecting a new identity based on a central unifying commonality of people : The vast majority of us have to work for a living . And we do so at the direction of other people . And we know that their interests aren ’ t the same as ours . This will be an identity filled with community , rituals , solidarity , and belonging , just like any other .
We live in a society marked by hierarchy and inequality — not as an unintended aftereffect , but built in its core . Previous systems , from feudalism to slavery , built along these lines seemed natural and everlasting at the time . I ’ ll join you part of the way in your quest to humanize capitalism , but I have no doubt that overcoming it is necessary .
Yes , we live in a society marked by hierarchy and inequality — and , yes , that ’ s intrinsic to capitalism . And , yes , power — economic power , political power — matters in terms of how the good things in life are distributed . Market fundamentalists who still insist it ’ s all about voluntary transactions within the context of a perfectly competitive and efficiency marketplace that neutrally and objectively sets economic outcomes are either kidding themselves or are trying to kid us .
But let ’ s be clear : This somewhat unsavory economic system called capitalism has lifted billions out of subsistence poverty since the industrial revolution and given us longer , healthier , happier lives to a degree not matched by any other system people have tried . And although some people have more power , money , security , and happiness than others , and some people get to boss other people around , the fault line is not between “ workers ” and “ capital. ” It ’ s between high-skilled workers and low , coastal metropolitan workers and rural ones , between white workers and nonwhite , men and women workers , religious workers and non-religious .
Let ’ s get real : The favorite politician of the oppressed , left-behind workers who you idealize is Donald Trump , while denizens of Wall Street titans and Hollywood moguls and tech billionaires back liberal candidates and causes .
One fundamental flaw of your analysis is that , as Karl Marx before you , you see economics as a zero-sum game , “ We know that their interests are not the same as ours , ” you write . In fact , we don ’ t know that . Rather , we know of capitalist systems in which when companies do well , the owners of capital and the workers both do well — and that the cooperative nature of their relationship generates a bigger pie to divide .
The other fundamental flaw is that you ignore the power that each of us has in a capitalist system as workers and consumers . Most of us are not without choices . We choose who we work for and what products we buy and what norms will govern economic behavior . This economic power is not less real than our political power as voters , and can be exercised individually and collectively .
And within this capitalist system , rich and powerful people who overplay their hands get their comeuppance all the time , losing their jobs , their fortunes and their reputations . Sometimes they even lose elections .
Bhaskar , the question isn ’ t whether there is inequality of wealth and power . The question is whether those lucky or talented enough to have wealth and power use it in socially beneficial ways .","As 2018 drew to a close, Steve Pearlstein, the Washington Post’s Pulitzer Prize-winning business columnist, published a book that would’ve been bizarre only a few years before.

In the political marketplace, ideas matter in terms of the outcome, even if they were not the driving force. That’s different than saying that ideology or some ideological movement played a starring role.

So in the book, I lay out several of those ideas and why they are have been pushed so far that they are no longer useful or valid.

The first is that greed is good and necessary for the workings of a market system, which now has been codified in the notion that businesses must be run to maximize return to shareholders.

The second is that market incomes are an objective measure of each person’s economic contribution — marginal utility, in the language of economics.

The third idea is that we don’t need to worry about the level of income inequality because all that really matters, at least in terms of morality and fairness, is equality of opportunity.

And the fourth idea is that there is an absolute tradeoff between economic equality and economic efficiency — that if we want more equal slices, then we will have to accept the reality that the pie (and thus each slice) will be smaller.

Very profitable companies shared those profits with all of their workers. Companies were loyal to their workers and expected loyalty in return. And that was true, by the way, at unionized and non-unionized companies.

There was a historical basis for these norms. We had just come out of wartime experience of shared sacrifice in which men of all types served with each other on the battlefield, and women of all types had worked side by side in factories and offices, and many essential goods were rationed equally to each household.

This shared experience was based on norms of equality, cooperation, trust. The idea that the only reason executives and businesses behaved in that way was because they were forced to by unions and a liberal political coalition is just wrong, although it is surely true that unions and liberal-minded voters and special interests had a hand in helping to shape those norms. And then norms changed.

How powerful are social norms? Well, just look at the #MeToo movement, a wonderful example of a changing social norm. What used to be accepted and tolerated no longer is. This has been a bottom-up process that nobody anticipated and nobody controls. In terms of the power structure, which you like to focus on, very little changed other than public opinion.

Our goal should be: Use all the tools available in a democratic society to convince a broad swath of the public — frontline workers, middle managers, professionals, executives, academics, journalists — that certain types of business behavior are no longer socially acceptable.

Unacceptable because they offend our moral sensibilities. Unacceptable because they are economically counterproductive. And unacceptable because they erode the trust and cooperation that are necessary for a successful capitalism, and a successful democracy.

Change the social norms in that way and the rules and laws naturally follow. That’s a goal that is more likely to be achieved, and more likely to be effective, than trying to change things by grabbing power and shoving a different set of rules and norms down everyone’s throats.

I think we’re looking far differently at not only how to change what’s rotten in the United States today, but also how we’ve won improvements in the past. You say that our country has never really had a “working-class political movement,” but we do have a long history of labor turmoil — not just on the shopfloor, but wider movements for the eight-hour-day and the mass unionization drives of the 1930s and efforts to expand social protections.

It was the power of trade unions and the political culture that emerged out of them that helped ensure that the prosperity of the postwar period was more widely shared.

What I have in mind for the future is quite simple: people banding together to defend their common interests through politics. We’re just a couple years removed from 13 million Americans voting for a self-described democratic socialist, someone who said that people deserve more than they’re getting and “millionaires and billionaires” were to blame.

Today, most Americans support Medicare-for-all, jobs programs, and other social-democratic policies. As they try to get these things, they’re going to run up against the power of those who benefit from the status quo. That’s not the resistance of social norms, it’s the resistance of segments of capital — it’s class struggle in the most classical sense.

Norms will follow those organizing efforts and conditions on the ground, and help consolidate gains, but I think you’re overstating their importance. There are powerful segments of business that existentially oppose things like Medicare-for-all and increased unionization, not as individual traits but to preserve their livelihoods. I don’t think the same can be said for #MeToo and other important struggles against sexism.

Concretely, I think that means broad-based left electoral campaigns, combined with new trade union organizing efforts in strategically positioned sectors — the year’s wave of teacher strikes, new efforts to rally nurses and those in supply and logistics, for example, and social movements for things like criminal justice, health care, and affordable housing.

The words of A. Philip Randolph still seem apt to me: “At the banquet table of nature there are no reserved seats. You get what you can take, and you keep what you can hold. If you can’t take anything, you won’t get anything; and if you can’t hold anything, you won’t keep anything.”

Every past advance — from the end of slavery to the creation of even our rudimentary welfare state — has come through struggle. The world and politics have changed, but I see no reason why the future will be any different.

If the left doesn’t speak to anger and try to “grab power” (and by that I mean win a majority) for our agenda, it’ll only benefit the xenophobes and scaremongers of the right.

Steve Pearlstein

Who would disagree with your idea of people banding together to defend their common interests through politics? But I think you are kidding yourself that the forces protecting the status quo are just millionaires and billionaires, and that all the rest of us are victims of the oppressive economic system they have imposed on us, or hoodwinked us into embracing.

That’s not to say the special interests, including business interests, don’t have disproportionate political and economic power. Of course they do. But there are all sorts of other special interests that I think you would recognize as mostly middle class in nature that have also shaped our system — like the ability to buy cheap goods from abroad or subsidies for homeownership.

Ours is still a largely middle-class country, with standards of living that are equal to or exceed that of most other countries in the world. And these middle-class Americans wouldn’t favor Medicare-for-all, particularly if you explained to them what it would really mean, or 90 percent marginal tax rates on the super-rich, or guaranteed jobs or free public higher education. There is probably a bit more inner socialism the typical American can discover, but not as much as you imagine. Many are as distrustful of government as they are of Wall Street or large corporations.

How about let’s start with fixing the capitalism we have — or as Raghuram Rajan and Luigi Zingales cleverly put it, saving capitalism from the capitalists. As I outlined in the book, I would start by getting money out of politics — corporate money but also union money. And ending the stranglehold Wall Street has put on the real economy be demanding companies be run to maximize shareholder value. And more vigorous antitrust enforcement to deal with old-fashioned consolidation and the natural winner-take-all tendencies of the new economy. We need to bring back a serious inheritance tax, a serious and reformed corporate tax and a top marginal income tax of 40 percent.

And while we are at it, why not create a new set of financial institutions — banks, insurance companies, mutual funds and pension funds — that are owned by their customers rather than by shareholders. Even a capitalist can understand the logic of an annual “dividend” for every American as his or her share of the nation’s natural and institutional bounty, particularly if it is combined with an obligation for three years of national service (my version of universal basic income).

Want to get really radical? How about ending school segregation by class the way we did with segregation by race, through enlarged school districts, magnet schools, and creative use of school choice.

I’m all for making it possible once again to organize a union without getting fired or spending the next decade in court, which unfortunately is the current reality. But there may be other, better ways to reinvigorate the union movement and give a bit more power to workers in a post-industrial economy. My guess is that many American workers don’t want the kind of union you pine for — the ones that undermined the competitive viability of their companies, the ones that rejected all pay for performance schemes and saddled companies with rigid work rules.

Maybe in a more professional, service, and tech-oriented economy, people would prefer unions that focused on providing services to their members (pensions, health insurance, legal advice) or providing mechanisms for them to have a greater voice in how their companies are run.

You are right that the teacher strikes have been as inspiring as they have been effective, but so has the #MeToo movement, which changed corporate behavior without unions or strikes but through public exposure and moral suasion.

The problem with your preferred model of permanent class struggle is that it ignores the importance of social capital — the trust in each other and in our common institutions — in much the same way that our current version of American capitalism does, with its ruthlessness, its inequality, and its celebration of greed and indifference.

Economic and political systems work best when there is a sense of shared purpose, shared sacrifice, and shared success, when people feel as if we are all in it together. But permanent class struggle, I fear, would discourage cooperation and erode trust — within firms, within communities, within countries.

Bhaskar Sunkara

Your reply gets a fundamental difference between us: You seem to think that the state is neutral and simply responds to the demands of different special interests. So in the past, when labor was strong, labor made unreasonable demands on the state and now today big corporations do the same.

But even if you took away corporate lobbying and got “money out of politics” through publicly funded elections and elected figures like Bernie Sanders to high office, the state would still have a built-in bias. It relies on revenue to fund itself, and that revenue comes almost entirely from the activities of private capitalists. As long as capitalists have the power to withhold investment, a minority of people will hold tremendous sway and our democracy will be undermined.

Were people hoodwinked into embracing a system like this? No, workers and capitalists are dependent on each other. Workers need their firms to be profitable, and that recognition has always tempered demands. But it’s an asymmetrical dependency: Workers need their jobs more than capitalists needs any individual worker.

Political democracy, won over the wishes of elites, has created avenues to improve the lot of working people through legislation and unions (whose power rests most fundamentally in the ability of people to go on strike and withhold their labor), and that’s evened the odds a bit, but that inequality hasn’t gone away.

Along the same lines, your definition of “middle class” seems mythical to me. Who are these middle-class Americans? Is it a nurse working double shifts, a bartender who saved up enough for a house and a car, or is it just highly educated professionals? If you’re making these definitions based on just income level you’re missing the important difference in status and relationships to between that of a well-paid unionized worker and a small business owner that might be earning the same. And if you don’t get that difference, you don’t get why the former has to organize collectively to make gains.

And finally, of course, I want to encourage cooperation and trust. I just want to do so through resurrecting a new identity based on a central unifying commonality of people: The vast majority of us have to work for a living. And we do so at the direction of other people. And we know that their interests aren’t the same as ours. This will be an identity filled with community, rituals, solidarity, and belonging, just like any other.

We live in a society marked by hierarchy and inequality — not as an unintended aftereffect, but built in its core. Previous systems, from feudalism to slavery, built along these lines seemed natural and everlasting at the time. I’ll join you part of the way in your quest to humanize capitalism, but I have no doubt that overcoming it is necessary.

Steve Pearlstein

Yes, we live in a society marked by hierarchy and inequality — and, yes, that’s intrinsic to capitalism. And, yes, power — economic power, political power — matters in terms of how the good things in life are distributed. Market fundamentalists who still insist it’s all about voluntary transactions within the context of a perfectly competitive and efficiency marketplace that neutrally and objectively sets economic outcomes are either kidding themselves or are trying to kid us.

But let’s be clear: This somewhat unsavory economic system called capitalism has lifted billions out of subsistence poverty since the industrial revolution and given us longer, healthier, happier lives to a degree not matched by any other system people have tried. And although some people have more power, money, security, and happiness than others, and some people get to boss other people around, the fault line is not between “workers” and “capital.” It’s between high-skilled workers and low, coastal metropolitan workers and rural ones, between white workers and nonwhite, men and women workers, religious workers and non-religious.

Let’s get real: The favorite politician of the oppressed, left-behind workers who you idealize is Donald Trump, while denizens of Wall Street titans and Hollywood moguls and tech billionaires back liberal candidates and causes.

One fundamental flaw of your analysis is that, as Karl Marx before you, you see economics as a zero-sum game, “We know that their interests are not the same as ours,” you write. In fact, we don’t know that. Rather, we know of capitalist systems in which when companies do well, the owners of capital and the workers both do well — and that the cooperative nature of their relationship generates a bigger pie to divide.

The other fundamental flaw is that you ignore the power that each of us has in a capitalist system as workers and consumers. Most of us are not without choices. We choose who we work for and what products we buy and what norms will govern economic behavior. This economic power is not less real than our political power as voters, and can be exercised individually and collectively.

And within this capitalist system, rich and powerful people who overplay their hands get their comeuppance all the time, losing their jobs, their fortunes and their reputations. Sometimes they even lose elections.

Bhaskar, the question isn’t whether there is inequality of wealth and power. The question is whether those lucky or talented enough to have wealth and power use it in socially beneficial ways.",www.vox.com,left,0M2Y61HtNy4jhGba

Capitalism draws on pre-liberal roots

We live in an era of collapsing confidence in institutions, and the market economy has been no exception. Polls show declining support for capitalism, especially among the young. And the market system is increasingly under attack not only from the left but from some smart social conservatives, populists, and nationalists on the right.

The 'Sanders effect'

Analysts saw a “Sanders effect” in Clinton’s speech Thursday.

On TPP, “I think she’s feeling the pressure on that” because of the Sanders campaign, says Dean Baker, co-founder of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. “This is a much stronger statement. It’s unqualified. Nothing’s ever 100 percent,but it would certainly make it more difficult as president to turn around and say otherwise.”

On the federal minimum wage, Clinton has tried not to commit to the Sanders campaign demand for $15 an hour, though it’s in the Democratic Party platform, and Thursday’s speech took that approach, not saying how much she’d push for.

“It’s perfectly reasonable for her to say we want a higher minimum wage … but she hasn’t committed herself to $15 an hour,” says Mr. Baker.

Her challenge is to connect with working-class voters who don’t see Clinton as fighting in their corner.

“People want to hear that she’s actually talking to them,” Baker says. “Whether she can convince them that she has programs that will make a difference remains to be seen…. She should be doing better among these people.”

Oren Cass, senior fellow at the free-market Manhattan Institute, is critical of her spending promises on clean energy, infrastructure, and tax breaks to create high paying jobs, and compares her plan to the Obama economic stimulus plan of 2009.

“We’ll see what the ultimate price tag is,” says Mr. Cass, who was domestic policy director of 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney’s campaign. “But it sounds an awful lot like the [Obama] stimulus.”

Little attention on the poor

Cass also observes that Clinton’s speech said little about the poor, with no mention of inner-city poverty. “There’s something of a disconnect between rhetoric that’s focused on the bottom quintile and people who can’t really make it in America today and who’s she talking to, the middle class.”

This week , President Trump reiterated his commitment to his “ hire American , buy American ” program — a supposedly crucial element in his “ economic nationalist ” program . The notion here is threefold : American companies should be forced to hire American labor ; government contracts should go to American companies ; American producers should be protected from domestic competition by revoking or altering international trade agreements .
All three of these policies have a long , ingloriously stupid history .
First , the notion that American companies should be forced to hire American labor is a conceit of the Left . It is based on the same failures of economic understanding that lead to advocating higher minimum wages : the notion that cramming through an increase in labor cost does not cost jobs to a company , does not raise costs to the consumer , and does not degrade the quality of future products .
Yet Trump and other protectionists such as Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Ann Coulter have long seen H-1B visas — supposedly high-tech visas allowing workers to enter the United States to fill jobs for domestically based companies — as a great bugaboo . There are certainly significant problems with the current administration of H-1B visas : Michelle Malkin has rightly pointed out that there are those who falsely sponsor immigrants to the United States without any intention of employing them . And she is also right to criticize the H-1B lie that workers from abroad never replace American workers , and the inflated claim that there is a serious shortage of Americans qualified to fill jobs in science , technology , engineering , and math ( STEM jobs ) . Other valid critiques of H-1B visas are that they tie visa-holders to jobs and give employers total leverage over them .
But there is a broader ideological critique that is simply false : the notion that America benefits as a country by heavily restricting its labor base rather than by expanding the pool of qualified applicants .
There is a strong case to be made that in a welfare state , we should curb any program that increases the domestic unemployment rate , because the taxpayers absorb the burden of the increased number of the unemployed . But there is no evidence that high-tech visas increase the unemployment rate , since high-tech companies will simply shift production overseas to take advantage of lower wages there and similar job qualifications ; this deprives American companies of jobs .
The goal of an economy is to create better products and services at a lower price , thereby creating new cycles of supply and demand . The goal of an economy is not to freeze the available pool of labor , thereby confiscating wealth from employers on behalf of employees lucky enough to be born inside the United States . It ’ s difficult to understand why people who think that we should have a closed immigration system in order to preserve jobs don ’ t also think that we should have dramatically higher minimum wages or forced price controls .
Why should taxpayers foot the bill for cement made in Pennsylvania rather than China , absent some political payoff from politicians ?
Second , Trump ’ s program of ensuring that government contracts go to American companies makes little sense , given that this is merely a government subsidy of popular political interests . Why should taxpayers foot the bill for cement made in Pennsylvania rather than China , absent some political payoff from politicians ? And in fact , Trump ’ s new program allows widespread waivers for government contracts if the government decides that product or pricing is insufficient from American suppliers . As Kevin Williamson wrote earlier this week : “ In practice , that means if you have the right friends and make the right donations , the Buy American rules may be used to steer contracts your way . If you don ’ t , they won ’ t . ”
Finally , Trump ’ s program of producing everything in America is economically illiterate . Earlier this year , ( alleged ) White House chief of staff Reince Priebus stated , “ We can make everything here , or our goal should be to try to make everything we can in the United States so that the money gets put in the pockets of Americans. ” That ’ s not only untrue , it ’ s simply nutty . Subsidizing domestic industry and cutting off imports in order to “ help ” the economy is a fool ’ s errand . Back in the 1930s , Nazi Germany embarked on a course of “ autarky , ” assuming that they could strengthen the domestic economy through a combination of subsidies and tariffs . The result , which Hitler actually wanted : a requirement for territorial expansion , since trade enriches countries with resources beyond their own borders . North Korea is autarkic today . So is Venezuela . Both are impoverished . Trade enriches both sides ; banning trade indirectly taxes certain domestic parties in behalf of others .
But this is the truly tyrannical side of “ economic nationalism ” : the idea that your freedom as an individual to engage in commerce must be made subservient to a sort of collectivist loyalty test . In its own way , it is no different than Joe Biden ’ s statements some years ago that paying higher taxes made you more patriotic . But patriotism isn ’ t about restricting your freedom and prosperity to help someone in a dying industry . It ’ s about upholding a system of freedom for everyone , even those who benefit more from those freedoms .
“ Economic nationalism ” is FDR ’ s economic interventionism and Herbert Hoover ’ s anti-trade policy repackaged . Donald Richberg , the second head of FDR ’ s National Recovery Administration , stated that America had to reject “ gold-plated anarchy that masqueraded as ‘ rugged individualism. ’ ” Instead , America should embrace “ the great essential industries . . . operated under public obligation appropriate to the public interest in them. ” In this logic , economic freedom should be made subservient to the supposed national interest . The result : the greatest depression in American history , relieved only by the full-scale militarization of American society in World War II .
It is not “ America First ” policy to put American individualism last and government redistributionism first ; that policy kills jobs and destroys liberty . Trump should know that as a businessman . He must learn it as president .

In its own way, it is no different than Joe Biden’s statements some years ago that paying higher taxes made you more patriotic. But patriotism isn’t about restricting your freedom and prosperity to help someone in a dying industry. It’s about upholding a system of freedom for everyone, even those who benefit more from those freedoms.

“Economic nationalism” is FDR’s economic interventionism and Herbert Hoover’s anti-trade policy repackaged. Donald Richberg, the second head of FDR’s National Recovery Administration, stated that America had to reject “gold-plated anarchy that masqueraded as ‘rugged individualism.’” Instead, America should embrace “the great essential industries . . . operated under public obligation appropriate to the public interest in them.” In this logic, economic freedom should be made subservient to the supposed national interest. The result: the greatest depression in American history, relieved only by the full-scale militarization of American society in World War II.

It is not “America First” policy to put American individualism last and government redistributionism first; that policy kills jobs and destroys liberty. Trump should know that as a businessman. He must learn it as president.

“When I can act on my own without Congress, I’m going to do so,” Obama said during a speech at North Carolina State University to unveil a federally backed manufacturing program. “And today I’m going to act.”

Obama’s pronouncement of action came moments after he once again called on Congress to pass legislation, now stalled in the Senate and yet to receive a hearing in the House, to extend long-term unemployment benefits that expired Dec. 28.

“In the short term, one thing Congress can do is listen to the majority of the American people and restore the unemployment insurance to people who need it,” Obama said.

Obama noted that North Carolina has “a higher than average unemployment rate” — 7.4 percent, compared to 6.7 percent nationally — and said “folks aren’t looking for a handout, they’re not looking for special treatment.”

Speaking jacketless, with his sleeves rolled up, Obama reiterated the White House message that 2014 will be a “year of action.”

Obama’s trip to Raleigh marked the second time in as many weeks the president has unveiled a program he proposed during last year’s State of the Union address.

Last week, Obama announced the first five of 20 planned Promise Zones that will receive federal tax incentives and grants as part of Obama’s anti-poverty efforts.

The manufacturing program, housed at North Carolina State, aims to design energy-efficient electronic devices to be used in motors and on power grids, the White House said. It will receive a five-year, $70 million grant from the Department of Energy, to be matched by local investors, universities and the state of North Carolina.

Obama’s manufacturing ambition includes a national network of 45 manufacturing institutes, though that would require congressional cooperation. Obama called for Congress to pass legislation, introduced last July, that would allow the Department of Commerce to build a network for manufacturing innovation.

“I want to encourage them to continue to pass the bills that will create 45 of these manufacturing hubs, and, in the meantime, I’m moving forward with 15 of my own,” Obama said.

Obama was to return to the White House on Wednesday afternoon to announce the nomination of Maria Maria Contreras-Sweet to lead the Small Business Administration and to meet with Senate Democrats at the White House.

Among the senators Obama was to see is Kay Hagan of North Carolina, an endangered Democrat facing reelection in November. She did not accompany the White House contingent on its trip to her home state.

“Sen. Kay Hagan couldn’t be here,” Obama told the crowd. “But I wanted to thank her publicly for the great work she’s doing.”

In discussions of poverty in the US, child poverty tends to get most of the focus.

And I think there are good reasons for that. While the US has more poverty than other rich countries in general, it is a particular outlier on child poverty.

We’re just about the only rich country without some kind of per-child cash grant distributed to most parents.

But lately I’ve started thinking that the US poverty discussion focuses a little too much around kids and not enough around childless adults.

I want to be clear: I still think offering a simple cash allowance to all parents, like almost all other rich countries do, would be very good policy. It’s an elegant and popular way to cut poverty, and there are developmental benefits that don’t apply as much when you’re supporting adults without children.

What’s more, they find that extreme poverty did not rise between 1993 and 2016 for people in households with children. By contrast, it more than doubled for individuals in childless households.

Why is extreme poverty concentrated in childless households?

Brady and Parolin aren’t alone in finding this. And their explanation for why childless poverty is outstripping child and parent poverty as a problem is startling: food stamps (formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP) have expanded much more for families with kids than for others.

It 's best part is that by spurring growth , it will undercut his own ethno-nationalistic agenda , which is why , if progressives had any sense , a big `` if '' , they 'd support it instead of demagoguing it !
If they are looking for something to fight , Trump 's ridiculous plans to increase defense spending offer a ton load of ammo . It is nuts that he wants $ 56 billion more in annual defense spending in a country that already spends as much as the next seven countries combined . And conservative deficit hawks worried about the budget ought to concentrate on curbing his new domestic spending , especially his proposed $ 1 trillion on infrastructure ( after his predecessor lavished almost the same amount with literally nothing to show for it except bridges to nowhere ) .
Trump noted that there were two principles—both noble—guiding his plan : Simplifying the tax code and lowering the tax burden on individuals and corporations .
The most conspicuous mark of his seriousness of this is what he did n't do , namely , embrace the Border Adjustment Tax loopiness of House Republicans that he himself had initially encouraged . They wanted to offset revenue losses from tax cuts by taxing imports to the tune of $ 1.2 trillion over the next decade from countries with higher tariffs than the United States . But this was a poison pill that , apart from being horrendously protectionist ( that a free-trader like Speaker Paul Ryan has surely earned a lot of bad karma for embracing ) , would have infinitely complicated the tax code for American businesses that have supply chains that span the globe , while sticking it to American consumers who 'd face higher prices .
But what he wants to do to simplify taxes for individual filers is good too . Broadly , he wants to reduce the tax brackets for individuals from seven to three and eliminate tax breaks and deductions except for those for charity and home ownership . To mitigate the tax increases that some might face due to this , he 'll double the personal tax deductions . And as a special fuck you to high-tax liberal states such as California and New York that did n't vote for him , he 's proposing to end the deductions for local and state taxes . Most of these are steps in the direction of a flatter tax code that 'll one day make the world an infinitely better place by ridding it of tax accountants and lawyers . But the other ███ to applaud it is that a less kinky tax code means a less distorted economy .
His ideas to accomplish this goal are decent but not flawless .
He wants to eliminate the liberal absurdity that is the Alternative Minimum Tax . When originally enacted in the mid-1960s , it was meant to bring to heel about a 150 super-rich families who were using loopholes and deductions to avoid paying any taxes at all . The AMT required everyone to calculate their taxes at a flat rate without breaks and at the regular rate with breaks and pay whichever was higher . But its been increasingly snagging folks who are not its targets , even after it was modestly indexed for inflation four years ago .
The bigger deal , however , is that he would compress the current 10 % , 15 % , 25 % , 28 % , 33 % , 35 % and 39.6 % tax brackets to 10 % , 25 % and 35 % . Clearly , the highest tax-brackets will get a nifty cut ( especially since Trump will also , much to the dismay of liberals , scrap the death tax ) and the lowest will be held harmless . As for the in-between folks , it will be important to pick the right income at which to position it so that a vast majority—if not nearly all—see declines in their tax bill , which will make it politically easier to push through .
Now , it is true that unlike the corporate tax cuts , reductions in individual tax rates wo n't necessarily spur growth ( although they could remove the disincentives to work and boost productivity ) and hence might add to the deficit . But Cato Institute 's Chris Edwards notes that that can be dealt with by eliminating deductions and credits , which is why Trump 's proposal to offer `` relief for families with child and dependent expenses '' is among the most disappointing aspect of his reform package .
Trump does n't explicitly say what form this relief would take , but he talked about child-care tax credits during his campaign . These will surely give reformocons wet dreams . But such credits are unfair to folks who do n't have children . And they unwisely pile another entitlement on top of the existing entitlement state , making its reform more elusive .
That flaw , however , does n't negate the crowning achievement that is his corporate tax reform proposal , the centerpiece of his package .
Trump would slash corporate tax rates from 35 percent ( 39 percent when state taxes are included ) to 15 percent and end America 's system of worldwide taxation that taxes companies even on their foreign income . Liberals have not yet figured out that taxing worldwide income discourages multinational companies from domiciling in America and loses , instead of gains , Uncle Sam revenues . Hence it is unlikely that they will do anything but play spoilsport on this measure . But there are quite a few liberals who have grokked that America 's corporate tax rates undermine America 's global competitiveness because these taxes are the highest in the developed world . The UK 's current rate is 20 percent going down to 17 percent , Denmark 's 24.5 percent , and Ireland 's an inspiring 12.5 percent .
This disparity shamed even President Barack Obama into proposing a 28 percent rate , something that New York 's Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer was in principle on board with . Even Harlem Democrat Rep. Charlie Rangel , who is just about as left as they get before turning into Bernie Sanders , recommended slashing this rate to 30.5 percent .
But what 'll give Democrats ( and some Republican deficit hawks ) conniptions , besides the size of this cut , is that Trump has shown no interest in making it revenue-neutral by raising taxes elsewhere or cutting spending . These worries are not baseless but they are overblown—and misplaced , at least at the moment .
The Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin may be exaggerating that , `` the tax plan will pay for itself with economic growth . '' But so is the Tax Policy Center , a liberal-leaning outfit , that estimates that the 15 percent rate would lead to a $ 2.4 trillion loss in revenue for Uncle Sam over 10 years .
Cato 's Edwards ' notes that the U.S. corporate tax rates are in the `` strong Laffer zone . '' ( The Laffer curve , named after Arthur Laffer , the economist who formulated it , shows that up to a point , tax cuts lead to an increase in revenues by fueling business expansion , broadening the tax base and attracting more foreign investments . ) Studies examining OECD countries have shown that corporate tax rates above 26 percent reduce government revenues . The U.S. corporate tax rate is 14 percentage points above that rate , which is why America has a lot of room to cut . Indeed , corporate revenues from Canada 's 15 percent central corporate tax rate right now constitute 2.1 percent of the GDP ( which is a bit higher than what it was when those rates were twice as high in the 1980s ) and America 's 35 percent rate 1.7 percent of the GDP , estimates Edwards .
A 15 percent rate in America may result in some revenue losses despite growth effects . That 's not ideal when America 's annual deficit is approaching $ 590 billion and its total debt , not counting unfunded entitlement liabilities , already exceeds its total GDP .
But America 's Number One challenge right now is boosting its sluggish economy that grew a lame 1.6 percent last year , its weakest performance in five years , and lifting stagnant wages , that are growing at a far lower rate than before the Great Recession . And tax cuts that stop penalizing business growth and expansion are the best known tool to man to fix that .
But this is not just a matter of improving America lives , but also American politics . The appeal of zero sum ethno-nationalism becomes infinitely greater when a moribund economy turns politics into a zero-sum game of dividing the spoils . Trump won because he found a populist narrative that masterfully combined left-wing class warfare with right-wing nativism . He told American middleclass voters that they were getting screwed , on the one hand , by a corrupt elite hell bent on keeping all the gains for itself and , on the other , immigrants and foreigners who were threatening their livelihoods and lifestyle .
Trump may not realize it but the appeal of such a zero-sum message goes away in a robust economy that releases the animal spirits of Americans . Economic growth is great not only because it allows consumers to trade their iPhone 6 for an iPhone 7 but because it makes every sectarian divide easier to manage . It will also inevitably require more workers , taking the wind out of Trump 's anti-immigrant bashing .
Trump , then , may himself be the best cure for Trumpism . That 's why , unless liberals have better ideas for reviving the economy ( and , puhlese , Keynesianism that Obama already tried and spectacularly failed does n't count ) , they should desist from using ad hominem attacks about Trump 's failure to release his tax returns to derail his tax reform . And Republicans who want to tame the federal deficit would do the country a far bigger favor by : ensuring that Trump 's infrastructure package is privately funded , curbing defense spending and reforming Medicare and Social Security . Defense , after all , consumes 16 percent of the federal budget and Medicare-Social Security more than half .
Trump has finally presented a solid policy reform plan , let him run with it .","President Donald Trump has proposed a ""big league"" (or is it ""bigly""?) tax reform plan that's not perfect – but it is just about as good as one can expect. It's best part is that by spurring growth, it will undercut his own ethno-nationalistic agenda, which is why, if progressives had any sense, a big ""if"", they'd support it instead of demagoguing it!

Trump noted that there were two principles—both noble—guiding his plan: Simplifying the tax code and lowering the tax burden on individuals and corporations.

Simplifying the tax code:

The most conspicuous mark of his seriousness of this is what he didn't do, namely, embrace the Border Adjustment Tax loopiness of House Republicans that he himself had initially encouraged. They wanted to offset revenue losses from tax cuts by taxing imports to the tune of $1.2 trillion over the next decade from countries with higher tariffs than the United States. But this was a poison pill that, apart from being horrendously protectionist (that a free-trader like Speaker Paul Ryan has surely earned a lot of bad karma for embracing), would have infinitely complicated the tax code for American businesses that have supply chains that span the globe, while sticking it to American consumers who'd face higher prices.

Most of these are steps in the direction of a flatter tax code that'll one day make the world an infinitely better place by ridding it of tax accountants and lawyers. But the other reason to applaud it is that a less kinky tax code means a less distorted economy.

Lowering the tax burden on individuals:

His ideas to accomplish this goal are decent but not flawless.

He wants to eliminate the liberal absurdity that is the Alternative Minimum Tax. When originally enacted in the mid-1960s, it was meant to bring to heel about a 150 super-rich families who were using loopholes and deductions to avoid paying any taxes at all. The AMT required everyone to calculate their taxes at a flat rate without breaks and at the regular rate with breaks and pay whichever was higher. But its been increasingly snagging folks who are not its targets, even after it was modestly indexed for inflation four years ago.

The bigger deal, however, is that he would compress the current 10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, 35% and 39.6% tax brackets to 10%, 25% and 35%. Clearly, the highest tax-brackets will get a nifty cut (especially since Trump will also, much to the dismay of liberals, scrap the death tax) and the lowest will be held harmless. As for the in-between folks, it will be important to pick the right income at which to position it so that a vast majority—if not nearly all—see declines in their tax bill, which will make it politically easier to push through.

Now, it is true that unlike the corporate tax cuts, reductions in individual tax rates won't necessarily spur growth (although they could remove the disincentives to work and boost productivity) and hence might add to the deficit. But Cato Institute's Chris Edwards notes that that can be dealt with by eliminating deductions and credits, which is why Trump's proposal to offer ""relief for families with child and dependent expenses"" is among the most disappointing aspect of his reform package.

Trump doesn't explicitly say what form this relief would take, but he talked about child-care tax credits during his campaign. These will surely give reformocons wet dreams. But such credits are unfair to folks who don't have children. And they unwisely pile another entitlement on top of the existing entitlement state, making its reform more elusive.

Corporate tax reform:

That flaw, however, doesn't negate the crowning achievement that is his corporate tax reform proposal, the centerpiece of his package.

Trump would slash corporate tax rates from 35 percent (39 percent when state taxes are included) to 15 percent and end America's system of worldwide taxation that taxes companies even on their foreign income.

Even Harlem Democrat Rep. Charlie Rangel, who is just about as left as they get before turning into Bernie Sanders, recommended slashing this rate to 30.5 percent.

But what'll give Democrats (and some Republican deficit hawks) conniptions, besides the size of this cut, is that Trump has shown no interest in making it revenue-neutral by raising taxes elsewhere or cutting spending. These worries are not baseless but they are overblown—and misplaced, at least at the moment.

The Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin may be exaggerating that, ""the tax plan will pay for itself with economic growth."" But so is the Tax Policy Center, a liberal-leaning outfit, that estimates that the 15 percent rate would lead to a $2.4 trillion loss in revenue for Uncle Sam over 10 years.

Cato's Edwards' notes that the U.S. corporate tax rates are in the ""strong Laffer zone."" (The Laffer curve, named after Arthur Laffer, the economist who formulated it, shows that up to a point, tax cuts lead to an increase in revenues by fueling business expansion, broadening the tax base and attracting more foreign investments.) Studies examining OECD countries have shown that corporate tax rates above 26 percent reduce government revenues. The U.S. corporate tax rate is 14 percentage points above that rate, which is why America has a lot of room to cut. Indeed, corporate revenues from Canada's 15 percent central corporate tax rate right now constitute 2.1 percent of the GDP (which is a bit higher than what it was when those rates were twice as high in the 1980s) and America's 35 percent rate 1.7 percent of the GDP, estimates Edwards.

A 15 percent rate in America may result in some revenue losses despite growth effects. That's not ideal when America's annual deficit is approaching $590 billion and its total debt, not counting unfunded entitlement liabilities, already exceeds its total GDP.

But America's Number One challenge right now is boosting its sluggish economy that grew a lame 1.6 percent last year, its weakest performance in five years, and lifting stagnant wages, that are growing at a far lower rate than before the Great Recession. And tax cuts that stop penalizing business growth and expansion are the best known tool to man to fix that.

But this is not just a matter of improving America lives, but also American politics. The appeal of zero sum ethno-nationalism becomes infinitely greater when a moribund economy turns politics into a zero-sum game of dividing the spoils. Trump won because he found a populist narrative that masterfully combined left-wing class warfare with right-wing nativism. He told American middleclass voters that they were getting screwed, on the one hand, by a corrupt elite hell bent on keeping all the gains for itself and, on the other, immigrants and foreigners who were threatening their livelihoods and lifestyle.

Trump may not realize it but the appeal of such a zero-sum message goes away in a robust economy that releases the animal spirits of Americans. Economic growth is great not only because it allows consumers to trade their iPhone 6 for an iPhone 7 but because it makes every sectarian divide easier to manage. It will also inevitably require more workers, taking the wind out of Trump's anti-immigrant bashing.

Trump, then, may himself be the best cure for Trumpism. That's why, unless liberals have better ideas for reviving the economy (and, puhlese, Keynesianism that Obama already tried and spectacularly failed doesn't count), they should desist from using ad hominem attacks about Trump's failure to release his tax returns to derail his tax reform. And Republicans who want to tame the federal deficit would do the country a far bigger favor by: ensuring that Trump's infrastructure package is privately funded, curbing defense spending and reforming Medicare and Social Security. Defense, after all, consumes 16 percent of the federal budget and Medicare-Social Security more than half.

Trump has finally presented a solid policy reform plan, let him run with it.",www.reason.com,right,xEgX3OtlQGVJX6vX

What’s happening

During his State of the Union address last week, President Trump touted the strength of the U.S. economy. “I am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been,” he said. Though some may quibble with such a bold statement, there’s no question that — at least by certain metrics — the economy is booming.

The economy is in the midst of the longest expansion in American history, as it continues to grow from the worst days of the Great Recession. Unemployment is at the lowest rate in 50 years, and the stock market has spiked to record levels.

A strong economy may be the most potent argument Trump has as he campaigns to win a second term. Even though a president’s influence on the economy is limited, voters tend to reward them when it’s strong and punish them when it’s weak. The last two incumbents to lose reelection, George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter, were defeated during flagging economies.

Why there’s debate

Trump’s supporters say he deserves praise for the historic highs the economy has reached since he took office. They credit his trillion-dollar tax cut and the trade battles with China, Mexico and others for boosting investment and creating jobs in the U.S.

Trump’s detractors say the gains made in the past three years are merely an extension of the progress Barack Obama set in motion. Not only did Obama prevent another depression, they argue, but he also built a solid foundation on which the current economic expansion has grown. Others say Trump has weakened the country’s long-term prospects by cutting taxes and increasing spending to create a short burst of growth that will ultimately destabilize the economy.

Another group rejects the idea that the economy is doing as well as it may seem. Most of the gains have been experienced by the wealthy, while the working class has fallen further behind, they argue.

What’s next

Though the economy is still growing, the rate of that growth slowed last year to the lowest levels in the Trump presidency. Whether that’s a sign the economic upswing is reaching its peak is unclear, economists say. Economies can’t grow forever, and another recession will come eventually.

Perspectives

Supporters

Trump deserves credit

“The Trump administration’s policies have finally produced the economic benefits that American workers should have experienced coming out of the recession but did not.” — Andy Puzder, Washington Post

Trump’s policies have directly led to economic growth

“Those things aren’t good luck or accidental. They’re the results of capitalism and a Republican president who passed the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and removed job-killing regulations that were stifling the business sector under the prior administration.” — Adriana Cohen, Fox News

Voters recognize Trump’s positive influence

“Trump’s policies have sparked the greatest economic renaissance America has seen in decades, and no amount of political spin can conceal that fact from the millions of Americans who are better off today thanks to his efforts.” — Julio Gonzalez, South Florida Sun Sentinel

Obama gets too much credit for the recovery

“Barack Obama inherited an economy with nowhere to go but up, and what followed was the slowest recovery since World War II. President Trump inherited an economy theoretically overdue for a recession and already returned to what economists considered full employment.” — Tiana Lowe, Washington Examiner

Critics

Trump is riding Obama’s momentum

“Overall, the economic metrics Trump beats his chest about are continuations of trends that started during the Obama administration, suggesting that the country has been climbing out of a recession for many years, not that Trump’s policies were necessarily transformative.” — Harry Cheadle, Vox

Down-ballot Democrats have helped more than Trump

“Poverty rates are falling not because of GOP tax cuts and the resulting ballooning of both inequality and the federal deficit, and not because of deregulation that makes the environment dirtier and workplaces less safe. They are falling mainly because Democratic-controlled cities and states are raising the minimum wage in the face of federal inaction, and are looking for ways to increase access to health insurance.” — Sasha Abramskyy, The Nation",www.news.yahoo.com,center,z6cgHfK4nGk8uMmK

What exactly are you going to do? There’s no answer to it,” adding, “He just says, ‘Well, I’m going to negotiate a better deal.’ Well, what, how exactly are you going to negotiate that? What magic wand do you have? And usually the answer is, he doesn’t have an answer.”

Would Mr. Obama like salt or salsa on the words he should eat? President Trump is proving that the past can be prologue.",www.foxnews.com,right,2AJfZKpCX3aiPuze

The Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower interest rates by a quarter-point at its meeting that concludes Wednesday and leave the option open for additional moves despite demands by President Donald Trump for a “ large ” rate cut .
“ We may get a dissent or two , but it seems like a 25-basis-point cut is pretty much locked in , ” said Julia Coronado , president and founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC in New York .
The Federal Open Market Committee will issue a policy statement at 2 p.m. after the two-day meeting concludes and Chairman Jerome Powell will brief reporters 30 minutes later .
The immediate outlook for policy has been made crystal clear thanks to a communications flub by New York Fed President John Williams in a July 18 speech .
Odds for a half-point cut rose after he recommended swift policy action if the economy weakens when rates are low , but fell back after the bank later clarified that he was not discussing upcoming policy moves . Trump weighed in on Williams ’ s remarks , saying a day later that he liked his first statement much more than his second .
The meeting still contains drama . It ’ s unclear how much opposition even a quarter-point cut will face within the FOMC , or what signal will emerge about the scope for further easing .
Underlying both questions are uncertainties about just how much the U.S. economy is likely to slow and how monetary policy should respond .
“ For a lot of them , 25 will feel like a down payment , ” said William English , a professor at Yale University and former senior Fed economist . “ But I think they ’ ll be willing to wait to get more information and make a decision about how much easing to do over time . ”
What Our Economists Say “ Uncertainty toward the timing and scope of additional action leaves markets more sensitive to signals of future policy measures than the well-telegraphed rate cut looming at present . Policy makers would be wise to take advantage of recent upbeat economic data to outline the parameters for a modest recalibration of rates in order to avoid getting pressured into a more pronounced easing. ” -- Carl Riccadonna and Yelena Shulyatyeva , ███ economists
Before Williams spoke on July 18 , investors were pricing in a quarter-point cut . Powell had laid out the case for easing amid global economic uncertainties and muted inflation . Other policy makers argued for lowering rates in a “ risk management ” approach .
In his remarks , Williams reviewed his long-standing belief that central banks should move aggressively in a downturn when rates are near zero . Investors took it as a signal that a half-point move might be on the table , until the New York Fed issued the clarification .
That steer , combined with a solid -- though not spectacular -- report on second-quarter economic growth , reduced the chances of a half-point cut to “ almost zero , ” said Carl Tannenbaum , chief economist at Northern Trust Corp. in Chicago .
The data showed the U.S. economy expanded at an annualized pace of 2.1 % , slower than the first quarter but above the 1.8 % expected by economists .
Dissents Looming After a period of quiet and consensus , FOMC dissents may be on the rise Source : ███
Central bank watchers anticipate some regional Fed presidents will argue against any cut at all . That group includes two current FOMC voters , Kansas City ’ s Esther George and Boston ’ s Eric Rosengren , so resistance could spur two dissents . The meeting ’ s minutes will be released on Aug. 21 , providing a fuller picture of any divide , and officials may detail their views in public in the meantime .
Several economists expect the committee ’ s post-meeting statement will repeat language from June promising to monitor incoming data and to “ act as appropriate to sustain the expansion. ” That will likely lead investors to expect another quarter-point cut as early as September , without committing the Fed to such a move .
“ The intention is likely to do another 25 , but the data will ultimately determine the willingness to do more , ” said Michael Gapen , chief U.S. economist at Barclays Plc in New York .
Powell can then use his press conference to further shape rate expectations . Another challenge will be to explain why the committee went ahead with a cut despite a slew of positive news . Since the Fed last met , the U.S. and China have returned to the trade negotiating table , and fresh U.S. employment and spending numbers have come in strong .
“ That ’ s a tricky issue for him , ” said English . “ Since June , the data ’ s been pretty good . ”

The Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower interest rates by a quarter-point at its meeting that concludes Wednesday and leave the option open for additional moves despite demands by President Donald Trump for a “large” rate cut.

“We may get a dissent or two, but it seems like a 25-basis-point cut is pretty much locked in,” said Julia Coronado, president and founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives LLC in New York.

The Federal Open Market Committee will issue a policy statement at 2 p.m. after the two-day meeting concludes and Chairman Jerome Powell will brief reporters 30 minutes later.

The immediate outlook for policy has been made crystal clear thanks to a communications flub by New York Fed President John Williams in a July 18 speech.

Odds for a half-point cut rose after he recommended swift policy action if the economy weakens when rates are low, but fell back after the bank later clarified that he was not discussing upcoming policy moves. Trump weighed in on Williams’s remarks, saying a day later that he liked his first statement much more than his second.

Rate Outlook

The meeting still contains drama. It’s unclear how much opposition even a quarter-point cut will face within the FOMC, or what signal will emerge about the scope for further easing.

Underlying both questions are uncertainties about just how much the U.S. economy is likely to slow and how monetary policy should respond.

“For a lot of them, 25 will feel like a down payment,” said William English, a professor at Yale University and former senior Fed economist. “But I think they’ll be willing to wait to get more information and make a decision about how much easing to do over time.”

What Our Economists Say “Uncertainty toward the timing and scope of additional action leaves markets more sensitive to signals of future policy measures than the well-telegraphed rate cut looming at present. Policy makers would be wise to take advantage of recent upbeat economic data to outline the parameters for a modest recalibration of rates in order to avoid getting pressured into a more pronounced easing.” -- Carl Riccadonna and Yelena Shulyatyeva, Bloomberg economists

Before Williams spoke on July 18, investors were pricing in a quarter-point cut. Powell had laid out the case for easing amid global economic uncertainties and muted inflation. Other policy makers argued for lowering rates in a “risk management” approach.

In his remarks, Williams reviewed his long-standing belief that central banks should move aggressively in a downturn when rates are near zero. Investors took it as a signal that a half-point move might be on the table, until the New York Fed issued the clarification.

That steer, combined with a solid -- though not spectacular -- report on second-quarter economic growth, reduced the chances of a half-point cut to “almost zero,” said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust Corp. in Chicago.

The data showed the U.S. economy expanded at an annualized pace of 2.1%, slower than the first quarter but above the 1.8% expected by economists.

Dissents Looming After a period of quiet and consensus, FOMC dissents may be on the rise Source: Bloomberg

Central bank watchers anticipate some regional Fed presidents will argue against any cut at all. That group includes two current FOMC voters, Kansas City’s Esther George and Boston’s Eric Rosengren, so resistance could spur two dissents. The meeting’s minutes will be released on Aug. 21, providing a fuller picture of any divide, and officials may detail their views in public in the meantime.

Several economists expect the committee’s post-meeting statement will repeat language from June promising to monitor incoming data and to “act as appropriate to sustain the expansion.” That will likely lead investors to expect another quarter-point cut as early as September, without committing the Fed to such a move.

“The intention is likely to do another 25, but the data will ultimately determine the willingness to do more,” said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Plc in New York.

Powell can then use his press conference to further shape rate expectations. Another challenge will be to explain why the committee went ahead with a cut despite a slew of positive news. Since the Fed last met, the U.S. and China have returned to the trade negotiating table, and fresh U.S. employment and spending numbers have come in strong.

“That’s a tricky issue for him,” said English. “Since June, the data’s been pretty good.”

He may also get questions on whether the Fed would join the U.S. government in intervening to weaken the dollar to aid U.S. exports after Trump told reporters last week that he had not ruled it out.

Balance Sheet

Financial markets will also watch for an early end to the runoff of securities from the Fed’s balance sheet. That process, scheduled to conclude at the end of September, modestly tightens policy by removing downward pressure on long-term bond yields.

Economists were divided on whether officials will want to halt the runoffs when they cut interest rates. Few saw an immediate cessation as likely, but some said it would simplify communications about the direction of monetary policy.

“The markets won’t be affected either way, but it’s a cleaner message” if the Fed halts the runoffs, Coronado said.

Employers in the United States are hiring at a brisk pace. Unemployment has sunk to a nearly healthy rate. Jobs are being filled across a range of industries.



Yet the September jobs report released Friday contained a puzzling fact: Paychecks still aren't growing.



Economists regard stagnant wages as a red flag for the 5-year-old recovery. Robust job growth has typically fueled rising wages. And without higher pay, workers have less money to spend and save — and that, in turn, keeps the economy from strengthening further.

Whatever meager pay raises most workers have received in this recovery have been all but eaten up by low inflation. The average hourly wage for non-management workers has remained $20.67 for two months. It's risen just 2.3 percent year-over-year, just slightly above inflation.



It just might be the pivotal challenge for families as well as for the economy. The size of a paycheck shapes budgets for consumers, whose spending accounts for most of the U.S. economy's activity.



Weak pay gains, along with lower-than-normal inflation, will also influence when the Federal Reserve decides to start raising interest rates. Without more pay raises spreading across the economy, the Fed has less pressure to raise a key short-term rate from its record low near zero.



So why hasn't vigorous hiring led to better paydays?



Three factors help explain the unusual trend:



UNEMPLOYMENT NEEDS TO GO EVEN LOWER



The last time monthly wage growth outpaced inflation in any meaningful way was from mid-2006 through 2007, just before the Great Recession started. The unemployment rate then ranged between 4.4 percent and 4.8 percent.

Why are President Donald Trump’s tariffs such a bad deal for the U.S. economy? It’s not just because they might start a trade war. It’s because of tax theory.

Now, most tax theory is incredibly boring. (Hopefully my former economics professors aren’t reading this column!) One reason is because it’s about taxes, which are not the most interesting subject to begin with. But another reason is that tax theory often involves very complicated mathematics describing highly abstract concepts. Many theories claiming to yield the “optimal” tax are only optimal in a world that doesn’t closely resemble the one in which we live. But the real world is so complicated -- the federal tax code alone contains more than 70,000 pages -- that beautiful theorems posited in economic papers are often next to useless in practice.

But still, there are some important insights to be gained from tax theory. One of these is the idea that intermediate goods shouldn’t be taxed. Intermediate goods are things used in the production of other, more complicated things -- steel for cars, transistors for computer chips, screens for mobile phones. In 1971, economists Peter Diamond and James Mirrlees realized that under certain conditions, it makes sense not to tax these things at all.

The reason is that taxing inputs causes companies to produce less than they otherwise would. Lower production means a smaller economic pie to divide up. Better, Diamond and Mirrlees concluded, to let companies make as much stuff as they can, and then to focus on dividing up that stuff among consumers.

Diamond and Mirrlees’ result holds perfectly true only in the idealized setting of an unrealistic economic model. But it provides powerful intuition that many countries have actually used to design their tax systems. Many countries, as well as the European Union, have value-added taxes, or VATs. These let companies deduct the cost of their intermediate goods when paying their taxes. As a result, a VAT only taxes the amount of value that ends up reaching the consumer.

The U.S. could choose to implement a VAT. Instead, under Trump, it’s doing almost the exact opposite. Most of Trump’s tariffs fall directly on inputs that U.S. manufacturers need to make their products.

Chad Brown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics has the numbers. According to Brown’s calculations, most of the $50 billion worth of Chinese products that Trump is threatening to impose tariffs on are things that U.S. producers use to make other things -- either intermediate inputs used directly in production, or capital goods:

Manufacturing Would Be Hit Hardest Trump's threatened tariffs against China, by product type Source: Chad Brown, Peterson Institute for International Economics

This is bad news for a lot of U.S. companies, although manufacturers will probably be hit the hardest. That would be another self-inflicted wound by an administration that was elected on promises to revive “Made in America.” Trump’s earlier round of tariffs on steel and aluminum were probably a key factor behind a rise in the prices U.S. factories pay for those metals:

Predictably, a large number of U.S. businesses have applied for relief from Trump’s metal tariffs. Granting exemptions helps keep U.S. manufacturers afloat, but also makes the tariffs themselves less effective. That just shows what a bad idea the tariffs are in the first place.

Diamond and Mirrlees’ theory may be just some abstract math on a page, but the insight is real and important -- if you want to give American manufacturing a boost, don’t use taxes to starve U.S. factories of the materials and equipment they need.

So what should Trump be doing instead? If he wants to start a trade war, he could at least focus his tariffs on consumer goods instead, such as televisions or phones. But a better idea would be to simply forget about tariffs, and promote U.S. exports instead.

Another good idea, taking a page from Diamond and Mirrlees’ book, would be to have a VAT in the U.S. VATs are a highly efficient form of taxation. They do tend to hit the poor harder than the rich, because they’re similar to consumption taxes, and poor people consume a higher percent of their income. But this can be solved by using the VAT to fund health care, housing subsidies and other services for poor Americans.

A VAT might also satisfy Trump’s thirst for trade war. Trump seems to think VATs represent a kind of tariff on imported goods. They don’t, and most VATs are neutral with respect to trade. But if the president’s desire to look tough on trade could be satisfied with an efficient form of taxation that doesn’t actually hurt U.S. producers, so much the better.

economic_policy,Reason,2,https://reason.com/2019/05/09/bernie-sanders-ocasio-cortez-credit-cards-poor-payday-loans/,Bernie Sanders' New Plan Will Make It Tougher for Poor People To Get Credit Cards,2019-05-09,"Peter Suderman, Brian Doherty, Ronald Bailey, Eric Boehm, Billy Binion, Christian Britschgi, Joe Setyon, Zuri Davis","One obvious truth that politicians have trouble grasping is that the best option in life for most people is sometimes not the best option for everyone .
Consider payday loans . Most people with stable finances and conventional banking accounts tend to avoid them . The rates and fees seem exorbitantly high when extrapolated out over long time frames , as critics tend to do .
These critics , most of whom would prefer to regulate the payday loan industry out of existence , argue that its rates are structured to intentionally confuse customers and that the business model is inherently predatory , trapping the poor in cycles of debt they might otherwise avoid .
These arguments suggest that people who choose to use payday loans do n't , and perhaps ca n't , understand the choices they are making . For their own good , those choices should be prohibited by our enlightened , elected betters . It is a form of benevolent condescension built on the belief that poor people ca n't count .
Accounts of the lived experiences of actual payday loan customers indicate otherwise . In 2017 , University of Pennsylvania Professor Lisa Servon published The Unbanking of America , a close look at people who lack traditional bank accounts , many of whom regularly use payday loans and check cashing services . During the course of her research , Servon worked as a teller at one such business for four months . What she found was that customers knew exactly what they were doing when they took out loans , and they usually had good reasons for doing so .
Many of them had previously had negative experiences with banks , in particular with overdraft fees , which tend to be higher than the rates charged by payday lenders when compared on an equal basis . Extended out over the course of a year ( which is longer than the typical repayment period ) , a typical payday loan has an annual percentage rate ( APR ) of about 390 percent ; over the same period , overdraft fees can range from 600 to nearly 800 percent . Bounced checks can result in effective annual APRs of more than 1,400 percent . Payday loans are n't cheap , but people with inconsistent cash flow often find that the alternatives are more expensive .
Servon learned that some payday loan customers needed cash more quickly than a bank would provide . Others valued the transparency of the pricing for various services . They were n't confused by the various fees and transactions ; on the contrary , they found them clearer and easier to manage than what they encountered at banks . In many cases , they saw payday loans as less expensive than the available alternatives . Nearly all of them understood in fine detail exactly what their financial resources were , as well as their obligations , and worked to meet them as best they could , often in trying circumstances . The payday lending operation was widely liked and acted as a kind of community center .
Much of this was not obvious to Servon when she started the job . But in time , she came to understand that the lives of her customers were different from hers , and thus benefited from different options . As she told NPR in an interview about her experience , `` All of these things that may appear irrational to those of us who have n't walked in the shoes of the people who are using these services , most of them turned out to be pretty rational decisions . '' The people she encountered were making tough choices in trying circumstances , but they knew quite well what they were doing .
Keep that in mind when someone like Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt. ) brags about having eliminated payday loans in his home state of Vermont , as he is today .

Here 's an even better idea : Sanders should stop thinking he knows what 's best for everyone else , and let ordinary people make decisions for themselves .","One obvious truth that politicians have trouble grasping is that the best option in life for most people is sometimes not the best option for everyone.

Consider payday loans. Most people with stable finances and conventional banking accounts tend to avoid them. The rates and fees seem exorbitantly high when extrapolated out over long time frames, as critics tend to do.

These critics, most of whom would prefer to regulate the payday loan industry out of existence, argue that its rates are structured to intentionally confuse customers and that the business model is inherently predatory, trapping the poor in cycles of debt they might otherwise avoid.

These arguments suggest that people who choose to use payday loans don't, and perhaps can't, understand the choices they are making. For their own good, those choices should be prohibited by our enlightened, elected betters. It is a form of benevolent condescension built on the belief that poor people can't count.

Accounts of the lived experiences of actual payday loan customers indicate otherwise. In 2017, University of Pennsylvania Professor Lisa Servon published The Unbanking of America, a close look at people who lack traditional bank accounts, many of whom regularly use payday loans and check cashing services. During the course of her research, Servon worked as a teller at one such business for four months. What she found was that customers knew exactly what they were doing when they took out loans, and they usually had good reasons for doing so.

Many of them had previously had negative experiences with banks, in particular with overdraft fees, which tend to be higher than the rates charged by payday lenders when compared on an equal basis. Extended out over the course of a year (which is longer than the typical repayment period), a typical payday loan has an annual percentage rate (APR) of about 390 percent; over the same period, overdraft fees can range from 600 to nearly 800 percent. Bounced checks can result in effective annual APRs of more than 1,400 percent. Payday loans aren't cheap, but people with inconsistent cash flow often find that the alternatives are more expensive.

Servon learned that some payday loan customers needed cash more quickly than a bank would provide. Others valued the transparency of the pricing for various services. They weren't confused by the various fees and transactions; on the contrary, they found them clearer and easier to manage than what they encountered at banks. In many cases, they saw payday loans as less expensive than the available alternatives. Nearly all of them understood in fine detail exactly what their financial resources were, as well as their obligations, and worked to meet them as best they could, often in trying circumstances. The payday lending operation was widely liked and acted as a kind of community center.

Much of this was not obvious to Servon when she started the job. But in time, she came to understand that the lives of her customers were different from hers, and thus benefited from different options. As she told NPR in an interview about her experience, ""All of these things that may appear irrational to those of us who haven't walked in the shoes of the people who are using these services, most of them turned out to be pretty rational decisions."" The people she encountered were making tough choices in trying circumstances, but they knew quite well what they were doing.

Keep that in mind when someone like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) brags about having eliminated payday loans in his home state of Vermont, as he is today.

In Texas, the average annual interest rate on a payday loan is 661%. In Vermont, the payday loan industry doesn't exist, because interest rates on small dollar loans are capped at 18%. We must cap interest rates on consumer loans and credit cards at 15% nationwide. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) May 9, 2019

'The New Deal and the Analogue of War'

After FDR defeated Herbert Hoover in 1932, the new president rolled out his first New Deal to confront the Great Depression. Roosevelt saw the economic collapse as directly analogous to war. In his first inaugural address, he said that Americans ""must move as a trained and loyal army willing to sacrifice for the good of a common discipline, because without such discipline no progress is made, no leadership becomes effective.""

Like President Woodrow Wilson during World War I, President Roosevelt and his New Dealers moved to cartelize the economy with the enthusiastic support of business executives such as Gerard Swope, president of General Electric. ""There was scarcely a New Deal act or agency that did not owe something to the experience of World War I,"" according to FDR scholar William E.

In advancing this assertion , neither Clinton nor Kaine mentioned government-subsidized housing ( the traditional conservative explanation for the Great Recession ) or excessive financial leverage on Wall Street ( the traditional liberal explanation ) . Indeed , their argument is new , and it needs to be fact-checked .
First , with respect to theory , no mainstream school of economic thought — Keynesian , classical , or monetarist — supports the view that tax relief can create recessions in the short-run .
The Keynesian view argues that deficit-financed tax cuts such as those passed in 2003 under Bush should provide stimulus to the economy by encouraging spending . Tax cuts provide such stimulus through boosting post-tax incomes , thus giving people more money to spend , which creates more economic activity and income for others . This idea is what is traditionally known as the Keynesian fiscal multiplier , and it was a fundamental motivation of the 2009 stimulus package . It ’ s an idea the Clinton-Kaine theory about the Great Recession rejects .
Many economists further argue that tax cuts which benefit the poor and middle-class deliver a bigger jolt to the economy , since such poorer individuals tend to spend a higher fraction of their incomes . The Bush tax cuts of 2003 slashed rates for all tax brackets , but even if they had been geared solely to the rich , Keynesian theory would suggest that they would produce a stimulative impact on the economy , although a significantly diminished one .
The classical and monetarist views argue that only permanent reductions in taxes have a positive impact on wealth in the long-run . The Bush tax cuts expired after eight years , so classical and monetarist economists could debate whether they count as a temporary fiscal shock or not . But neither school believes that tax cuts have a negative effect on economic activity . ( It ’ s important to note that income and wealth inequality are a separate matter . )
The only plausible economic theory that could support the Kaine-Clinton argument is that deficit-financed tax cuts create recessions by expanding public debt to the point of fiscal insolvency , as happened in Greece . But that ’ s not what happened in the Great Recession of 2008–2009 .
Just as mainstream economic theory offers no support for the idea that the Bush tax cuts were responsible for the recession , empirical work on the impact of tax cuts in isolation suggests that they almost always boost consumption and economic activity to varying degrees .
University of Michigan economist Matthew Shapiro has found that over the last decade , tax cuts ranging from the initial tax-rate reductions enacted in 2001 under President Bush to the 2009 payroll-tax cuts under President Obama boosted economic activity to varying degrees . ( It ’ s easy to forget that the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 , signed into law by Obama after the fiscal-cliff negotiations , actually retained nearly all of the Bush tax cuts for those making less than $ 400,000 per year , only increasing marginal rates on those making more than that . )
Few argue ( and rightly so ) that any of these tax cuts are self-financing . Quite the opposite : The continuing trend whereby the government takes in less than it spends has led to perennial deficits for 15 years . Perhaps such deficits could create fiscal drag on growth in the future , but that will only come in the form of higher taxes and lower growth , which again goes to show that tax cuts do not directly spur recessions .
# related # The Clinton campaign ’ s flawed theory of the Great Recession bears many resemblances to the false argument spouted by Bernie Sanders in the primaries : that the repeal of Glass-Steagall created the financial crisis . Both theories propagate a lie — in Sanders ’ s case , the debunked idea that reinstating Glass-Steagall would have broken up the investment banks or commercial lenders that nearly brought down the system — meant to castigate a particular group for political gain .
But while Sanders could ultimately be dismissed as a radical with no shot at power , Hillary Clinton may very well be our next president , so when she argues that tax cuts cause recessions , her argument can ’ t be allowed to stand . It ’ s the latest in a series of political maneuvers meant to slander the other party at the expense of honest policy discussion , and she shouldn ’ t be allowed to get away with it .

To argue otherwise is to put politics before policy.

In Tuesday’s vice-presidential debate, Tim Kaine repeated a new economic theory brought to the national stage by Hillary Clinton in the first presidential debate: that the Bush tax cuts of 2003 somehow caused the Great Recession.

In advancing this assertion, neither Clinton nor Kaine mentioned government-subsidized housing (the traditional conservative explanation for the Great Recession) or excessive financial leverage on Wall Street (the traditional liberal explanation).

Many economists further argue that tax cuts which benefit the poor and middle-class deliver a bigger jolt to the economy, since such poorer individuals tend to spend a higher fraction of their incomes. The Bush tax cuts of 2003 slashed rates for all tax brackets, but even if they had been geared solely to the rich, Keynesian theory would suggest that they would produce a stimulative impact on the economy, although a significantly diminished one.

The classical and monetarist views argue that only permanent reductions in taxes have a positive impact on wealth in the long-run. The Bush tax cuts expired after eight years, so classical and monetarist economists could debate whether they count as a temporary fiscal shock or not. But neither school believes that tax cuts have a negative effect on economic activity. (It’s important to note that income and wealth inequality are a separate matter.)

The only plausible economic theory that could support the Kaine-Clinton argument is that deficit-financed tax cuts create recessions by expanding public debt to the point of fiscal insolvency, as happened in Greece. But that’s not what happened in the Great Recession of 2008–2009.

Just as mainstream economic theory offers no support for the idea that the Bush tax cuts were responsible for the recession, empirical work on the impact of tax cuts in isolation suggests that they almost always boost consumption and economic activity to varying degrees.

University of Michigan economist Matthew Shapiro has found that over the last decade, tax cuts ranging from the initial tax-rate reductions enacted in 2001 under President Bush to the 2009 payroll-tax cuts under President Obama boosted economic activity to varying degrees. (It’s easy to forget that the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, signed into law by Obama after the fiscal-cliff negotiations, actually retained nearly all of the Bush tax cuts for those making less than $400,000 per year, only increasing marginal rates on those making more than that.)

Few argue (and rightly so) that any of these tax cuts are self-financing. Quite the opposite: The continuing trend whereby the government takes in less than it spends has led to perennial deficits for 15 years. Perhaps such deficits could create fiscal drag on growth in the future, but that will only come in the form of higher taxes and lower growth, which again goes to show that tax cuts do not directly spur recessions.

#related#The Clinton campaign’s flawed theory of the Great Recession bears many resemblances to the false argument spouted by Bernie Sanders in the primaries: that the repeal of Glass-Steagall created the financial crisis. Both theories propagate a lie — in Sanders’s case, the debunked idea that reinstating Glass-Steagall would have broken up the investment banks or commercial lenders that nearly brought down the system — meant to castigate a particular group for political gain.

But while Sanders could ultimately be dismissed as a radical with no shot at power, Hillary Clinton may very well be our next president, so when she argues that tax cuts cause recessions, her argument can’t be allowed to stand. It’s the latest in a series of political maneuvers meant to slander the other party at the expense of honest policy discussion, and she shouldn’t be allowed to get away with it.

Biden said in a statement Monday that he would treat foreign interference as an “ an adversarial act that significantly affects the relationship between the United States and the interfering nation ’ s government. ” He criticized President Donald Trump for not doing enough in response to U.S. intelligence agencies ’ assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election .

economic_policy,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/2020/4/9/21214800/senate-democrats-block-small-business-funding-paycheck-protection-program,Why Democrats are blocking a bill that boosts funding for small businesses,2020-04-09,"Li Zhou, Jen Kirby, Zeeshan Aleem, Anna North, Ian Millhiser","Democrats are blocking an attempt to give small businesses a $ 250 billion boost . But why ?
At first glance , it ’ s a surprising move , since Democrats support providing more funding to small businesses and workers experiencing severe economic trouble caused by the fallout of the coronavirus outbreak . But the answer is simple : Democrats want to use the leverage they have in Congress so that Republicans don ’ t just approve more money for small businesses while leaving out other programs that also desperately need more funding .
This approach was evident Thursday when Senate Democrats blocked Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ’ s attempt to pass a standalone small-business funding bill via unanimous consent .
Democratic leaders explained that the move was an opportunity to push for more expansive stimulus than Republicans have otherwise considered , a tactic they also used with the CARES Act . A few weeks ago , Democrats blocked the initial proposal offered by Senate Republicans , which included fewer restrictions on a $ 500 billion bailout fund aimed at corporations — and less generous unemployment insurance benefits . ( Because every bill requires at least 60 votes to pass , all legislation requires at least some Democratic buy-in . )
“ You may recall that just before we came together and passed the CARES Act 96-0 , the Majority Leader ... tried to ram through an unfinished product , ” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen ( D-MD ) in a floor speech . “ It didn ’ t work then and it ’ s not going to work today . ”
Related How small businesses can get money from the stimulus package
In the short term , the downside of this approach is that funds are not immediately approved to bolster the Paycheck Protection Program , a loan program for small businesses that has seen strong demand and limited availability amid a chaotic rollout . But it ’ s a sign that Democrats are willing to use their leverage to push for more comprehensive stimulus for workers and businesses .
The central disagreement between Republicans and Democrats on this “ interim ” spending bill , which they are considering before the next major stimulus package , is how much money it should include — and who it should help .
For now , Republicans leaders want to keep this measure narrow , focused exclusively on giving a $ 250 billion boost to the Paycheck Protection Program , an effort aimed at providing small businesses and nonprofits with forgivable loans . Democrats , meanwhile , think the small business money should be spread across a couple different programs , and want more funds added to the legislation including $ 100 billion for health care providers , $ 150 billion for states and cities , and more support for SNAP .
Republicans have argued that it would be easier and more efficient to approve the money for small businesses independently — and they note that funds for states and hospitals from the CARES Act are still being doled out .
“ That by definition is a clean bill , ” McConnell said in a floor speech . “ I want to add money to the only part of our bipartisan bill that is currently at risk of running out of money . ”
Democrats , however , disagree . They noted that the Paycheck Protection Program is not the only effort that needs more money . The Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program , which includes $ 10,000 in forgivable advances for the businesses that qualify , also requires replenishing . There are concerns , too , about how the existing $ 349 billion designated for PPP has been allocated : Democrats are pushing for some of the new funds to be set aside for community-based lenders , so more businesses can access these loans since larger banks like Bank of America have put limitations on who can apply .
Plus , while the CARES Act had already allocated money to health care providers and states and cities , Democrats note that it ’ s far from enough to make up for the lost revenue that these institutions are experiencing because of the coronavirus outbreak . In addition to the $ 100 billion that the CARES Act has for hospitals , and the $ 150 billion it has for states , Democrats are interested in adding more to cover costs like medical supplies and tax losses .
“ We ’ ve heard from our health care providers that they ’ re ready to close the doors , ” said Sen. Ben Cardin ( D-MD ) . “ They can ’ t stay in business today , it ’ s urgent . ”
According to an NPR report , hospitals are struggling financially as their revenues go down and costs mount for new equipment and resources to combat coronavirus . States , too , are seeing major shortfalls from reduced tax income during this time . The SNAP expansion proposed by Democrats , which would increase the maximum benefit that individuals and families could receive by 15 percent , is also in response to demand for the program in several states .
Since both Democrats ’ and Republicans ’ proposals were blocked on Thursday , there won ’ t be any action on additional funding this week , but the fight offers a glimpse of the conflict and negotiation yet to come .
It ’ s possible that no new money gets passed until the fourth stimulus bill
Given the ongoing standoff between the two parties , it ’ s looking like additional coronavirus relief funds might not get passed by Congress until lawmakers begin considering a fourth stimulus package .
It ’ s clear that workers and businesses are going to need significantly more funding in order to weather the ongoing economic downturn . As of this week , more than 220,000 small business loans have already been processed , and over 16 million people have filed for unemployment insurance in recent weeks .
Lawmakers are expected to be back at the Capitol on April 20 , and negotiations on the next stimulus will likely continue between now and then . As ███ ’ s Ella Nilsen has reported , the fourth package is likely to include more money for several provisions included in the CARES Act , including direct payments and additional funds for small businesses .
“ Nobody believes this is the Senate ’ s last word on Covid-19 , ” McConnell said .

At first glance, it’s a surprising move, since Democrats support providing more funding to small businesses and workers experiencing severe economic trouble caused by the fallout of the coronavirus outbreak. But the answer is simple: Democrats want to use the leverage they have in Congress so that Republicans don’t just approve more money for small businesses while leaving out other programs that also desperately need more funding.

This approach was evident Thursday when Senate Democrats blocked Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s attempt to pass a standalone small-business funding bill via unanimous consent.

Democratic leaders explained that the move was an opportunity to push for more expansive stimulus than Republicans have otherwise considered, a tactic they also used with the CARES Act. A few weeks ago, Democrats blocked the initial proposal offered by Senate Republicans, which included fewer restrictions on a $500 billion bailout fund aimed at corporations — and less generous unemployment insurance benefits. (Because every bill requires at least 60 votes to pass, all legislation requires at least some Democratic buy-in.)

“You may recall that just before we came together and passed the CARES Act 96-0, the Majority Leader ... tried to ram through an unfinished product,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) in a floor speech. “It didn’t work then and it’s not going to work today.”

Related How small businesses can get money from the stimulus package

In the short term, the downside of this approach is that funds are not immediately approved to bolster the Paycheck Protection Program, a loan program for small businesses that has seen strong demand and limited availability amid a chaotic rollout. But it’s a sign that Democrats are willing to use their leverage to push for more comprehensive stimulus for workers and businesses.

What Democrats want added to the “interim” spending bill

The central disagreement between Republicans and Democrats on this “interim” spending bill, which they are considering before the next major stimulus package, is how much money it should include — and who it should help.

For now, Republicans leaders want to keep this measure narrow, focused exclusively on giving a $250 billion boost to the Paycheck Protection Program, an effort aimed at providing small businesses and nonprofits with forgivable loans. Democrats, meanwhile, think the small business money should be spread across a couple different programs, and want more funds added to the legislation including $100 billion for health care providers, $150 billion for states and cities, and more support for SNAP.

Republicans have argued that it would be easier and more efficient to approve the money for small businesses independently — and they note that funds for states and hospitals from the CARES Act are still being doled out.

“That by definition is a clean bill,” McConnell said in a floor speech. “I want to add money to the only part of our bipartisan bill that is currently at risk of running out of money.”

Democrats, however, disagree. They noted that the Paycheck Protection Program is not the only effort that needs more money. The Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program, which includes $10,000 in forgivable advances for the businesses that qualify, also requires replenishing. There are concerns, too, about how the existing $349 billion designated for PPP has been allocated: Democrats are pushing for some of the new funds to be set aside for community-based lenders, so more businesses can access these loans since larger banks like Bank of America have put limitations on who can apply.

Plus, while the CARES Act had already allocated money to health care providers and states and cities, Democrats note that it’s far from enough to make up for the lost revenue that these institutions are experiencing because of the coronavirus outbreak. In addition to the $100 billion that the CARES Act has for hospitals, and the $150 billion it has for states, Democrats are interested in adding more to cover costs like medical supplies and tax losses.

“We’ve heard from our health care providers that they’re ready to close the doors,” said Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD). “They can’t stay in business today, it’s urgent.”

According to an NPR report, hospitals are struggling financially as their revenues go down and costs mount for new equipment and resources to combat coronavirus. States, too, are seeing major shortfalls from reduced tax income during this time. The SNAP expansion proposed by Democrats, which would increase the maximum benefit that individuals and families could receive by 15 percent, is also in response to demand for the program in several states.

Since both Democrats’ and Republicans’ proposals were blocked on Thursday, there won’t be any action on additional funding this week, but the fight offers a glimpse of the conflict and negotiation yet to come.

It’s possible that no new money gets passed until the fourth stimulus bill

Given the ongoing standoff between the two parties, it’s looking like additional coronavirus relief funds might not get passed by Congress until lawmakers begin considering a fourth stimulus package.

It’s clear that workers and businesses are going to need significantly more funding in order to weather the ongoing economic downturn. As of this week, more than 220,000 small business loans have already been processed, and over 16 million people have filed for unemployment insurance in recent weeks.

Lawmakers are expected to be back at the Capitol on April 20, and negotiations on the next stimulus will likely continue between now and then. As Vox’s Ella Nilsen has reported, the fourth package is likely to include more money for several provisions included in the CARES Act, including direct payments and additional funds for small businesses.

“Nobody believes this is the Senate’s last word on Covid-19,” McConnell said.

The Federal Reserve lowered its economic outlook Wednesday after a harsh winter chilled the U.S economy's growth, reducing the odds for an initial interest rate hike as soon as the Fed's June meeting.

In a statement after a two-day meeting the Fed gave no clear signal of when it plans to raise its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2006 but policymakers have indicated they expect to act this year.

The Fed statement was released at 2 p.m. ET.

As of 2:55 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average was down about 55 points, or 0.3%, to 18,056 and the Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 5 points, or 0.3%, to 2110. The Nasdaq composite was down 17 points, or 0.3%, to 5038. Yields on 10-year government bonds sprang above 2%.

The Fed said economic growth ""slowed during the winter months, in part reflecting transitory factors."" Unusually cold weather, for example, hindered economic activity. The Fed said it expects the economy to rebound and grow at a moderate pace in coming months.

With that optimistic view, the Fed didn't rule out a June rate increase, as it virtually foreclosed the chances of an April hike in its statement last month. Still, its assertion that temporary factors were only part of the reason for last quarter's slowdown suggests the central bank may want to hold off a few months before hoisting the target range for its federal funds rate, which has been near zero since the 2008 financial crisis.

While a June rate increase ""does not look very likely,"" it ""remains an option if the data suddenly turn much stronger than expected,"" Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist of High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note to clients.

Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics said ""it would take something quite spectacular to convince Fed officials to raise rates in June.""

The Fed's statement noted that job growth ""moderated"" and household spending declined in recent weeks, though inflation-adjusted incomes ""rose strongly, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices.""

Business investment, however, ""softened"" and exports declined, the statement said. The Fed added that inflation continued to run below the Fed's target, ""partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of non-energy imports."" Fed policymakers said they expect inflation ""to rise gradually toward 2% over the medium-term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects"" of low energy and import prices dissipate.

A strong dollar has hurt manufacturers' exports and the plunge in oil prices has led energy companies to slash investment.

The government said Wednesday morning that the economy grew just 0.2% at an annual rate in the first quarter, down from 2.2% in the October-December period and below the modest 1% pace expected by economists.

Meanwhile, inflation remains well below the Fed's annual 2% target, with the government reporting that the Fed's preferred measure, which excludes food and energy costs, rose 0.9% last quarter. That's the smallest increase since 2010.

The economy expanded at a 3.5 percent annual rate in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said Friday. That's slower than the second quarter's blockbuster 4.2 percent, but it puts the economy on pace for the fastest annual growth in 13 years.

Private analysts had estimated a 3.4 percent growth rate in gross domestic product for the third quarter.

Consumer spending jumped at a 4 percent rate in the July-September quarter — the fastest in about four years and topping the 3.8 percent in the prior three months.

Former White House economist Jared Bernstein said the strong showing reflects the fact that so many people are in the job market.

""Lots of people are working and drawing paychecks,"" he said. ""Even if those paychecks aren't growing as fast as we might like, that's going to fuel economic growth and in this report, in fact, the strongest sector was consumer spending.""

The travel industry was one sector that benefited from that increased spending.

""We set records around Labor Day and Memorial Day this year and Fourth of July in terms of travel, and so they're spending more for trips and they're spending more with us,"" said Elie Maalouf, Americas CEO of IHG, the hotel group that owns Holiday Inn and other chains.

Overall growth may have been affected, in part, by Hurricane Florence, which flooded the Southeast U.S. in September. The Commerce Department said Florence resulted in losses of $37 billion in property and equipment. Earlier, Moody's Analytics estimated the economic cost of the storm at $38 billion to $50 billion. And Hurricane Michael, which plowed through the Florida Panhandle and Georgia earlier this month, could affect fourth-quarter GDP.

Last month, the Federal Reserve boosted its growth projection to 3.1 percent for 2018, but it saw growth slowing to 2.5 percent next year.

The economy has been expanding in the 2 percent range in the past few years, but growth spiked in the second quarter, boosted by consumer spending and exports.

But exports decreased at a 3.5 percent pace in the third quarter after jumping 9.3 percent in the second quarter. Analysts had cautioned that the previous increase in exports was sparked by looming tariffs by China in its ongoing trade war with the United States. So they said that the export boom probably would not be sustained.

With unemployment at nearly 50-year lows, consumers have been confident enough to spend. The Conference Board's measure of consumer confidence rose in September and retail sales grew 4.7 percent last month from a year earlier.

But the housing market is starting to slow, amid higher interest rates.

Sales of new homes fell 5.5 percent in September — the fourth monthly drop in a row — and resales were down 3.4 percent.

The Fed has been raising interest rates as the economy continues to recover from the Great Recession. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages are approaching 5 percent, which may discourage some homebuying.

Republicans argued that Congress was without the authority to compel people to enter the marketplace by purchasing a product -- that such decisions should be freely made by individuals and that that freedom was protected from governmental interference by the Constitution .

With the stroke of a pen, the president assaulted the heart of the law that was the domestic centerpiece of his predecessor’s administration. How did this happen? How can a U.S. president, who took an oath to enforce the laws faithfully, gut one of them merely because he disagrees with it?

Here is the back story.

When ObamaCare went through Congress in 2010, all Democrats in Congress supported it and all congressional Republicans were opposed. The crux of their disagreement was the law’s command that everyone in the United States obtain and maintain health insurance -- a command that has come to be known as “the individual mandate.”

Democrats argued that the commerce clause of the Constitution, which permits Congress to regulate commerce among the states, also permits it to compel commercial activity on the part of individuals who make up a highly regulated component of interstate commerce.

To ensure compliance with the individual mandate, the law provided that the IRS would collect the fair market value of a bare-bones insurance policy from those who did not obtain and maintain one. The government would then take that money and purchase a health insurance policy for that individual who rejected the law’s command.

Though Congress did not call it a tax and the government’s lawyers uniformly and consistently denied in all courts where it was challenged that it was a tax and President Barack Obama rejected the idea that it was a tax and even the lawyers for the challengers denied it was a tax, a 5-4 majority in the Supreme Court characterized the money collected by the IRS from noncompliant individuals as a tax.

Dean Baker: Trump agenda looks like the Republican agenda that we have seen many times before

Dean Baker is co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington and the author of ""Getting Back to Full Employment: A Better bargain for Working People,"" and ""The End of Loser Liberalism: Making Markets Progressive."" The views expressed are his own.

(CNN) Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump gave his first major economic address on Monday. Most of the speech was devoted to putting forward a more or less standard set of Republican policies -- Trump promised large tax cuts that would primarily benefit higher-income taxpayers, ending the Affordable Care Act and curtailing government regulation. But he also broke with Republican orthodoxy, rejecting the Trans-Pacific Partnership, proposing renegotiating NAFTA, and vowing to take a firmer stance on currency management and other issues with our trading partners.

What would some of this mean in practice?

Dean Baker

The proposal for tax cuts would put in place a system with three tax brackets of 12%, 25%, and 33%. Trump didn't indicate the cutoffs for the brackets, so it's not possible to determine how much the different groups would save. However, it is certain that the highest-income taxpayers would save under the Trump plan.

Currently, high-income taxpayers pay a 39.6% tax rate on income over $415,000 for a single individual. If a high-level executive or Wall Street trader makes $2.4 million a year ( roughly the average for the richest 1% ), they would save $120,000 from their tax bill just on the reduction in the top tax bracket. For the richest 0.1%, the savings would average almost $700,000 a year.

Trump also called for large cuts in the corporate tax rate. Currently, corporations pay on average a bit more than 25% of their profits in taxes . Trump committed to a tax code in which no corporation would pay more than 15% of its profits in taxes. This implies a reduction in revenue from the corporate income tax of more than 25%, or a loss in revenue of close to $100 billion a year.

Mccaskill, Josh Gerstein","One of Donald Trump ’ s top campaign promises — a trillion-dollar program to rebuild highways , tunnels , bridges and airports — is already meeting resistance from conservatives .
The president-elect has vowed that his infrastructure proposal will create “ millions ” of jobs , likening it to Dwight Eisenhower ’ s creation of the interstate highway system . It ’ s one piece of his agenda that ’ s drawing support from Democrats , who love public works programs just as much as Trump loves to brag about his experience building golf courses and skyscrapers .
But Trump ’ s 10-year infrastructure proposal could offer an early test of how some of his more unconventional policy ideas will fly with conservative Republicans in Congress — even though he hasn ’ t made it clear whether much , or even any , of that $ 1 trillion would come from federal coffers .
Dan Holler , spokesman for the group Heritage Action for America , questioned the job-creation claims for such plans , in the same way that conservatives have scoffed at the benefits of President Barack Obama ’ s $ 832 billion stimulus .
`` Conservatives do not view infrastructure spending as an economic stimulus , and congressional Republicans rightly rejected that approach in 2009 , ” said Holler , whose group is the political arm of The Heritage Foundation .

It ’ s unclear whether these critiques presage major problems for Trump ’ s plan , which he has yet to put forth in more than skeletal form .
The language Trump has put out so far suggests that his actual infrastructure spending would amount to far less than $ 1 trillion in federal money — relying instead on policy strategies like tax credits to spur private investment in transportation projects . He also hasn ’ t suggested any fix for the government ’ s perpetually cash-strapped Highway Trust Fund , which relies on a federal gasoline tax that Congress hasn ’ t hiked for 23 years .
Even so , Trump cheered infrastructure advocates from both parties when he gave the issue a prime mention during his victory speech early Wednesday .
“ We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways , bridges , tunnels , airports , schools , hospitals , ” Trump said . “ We ’ re going to rebuild our infrastructure — which will become , by the way , second to none — and we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it . ”

“ He gets all of that instinctively , ” another transportation lobbyist said . “ That ’ s all very positive . ”
Senate Commerce , Science and Transportation Chairman John Thune ( R-S.D . ) and House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Bill Shuster ( R-Pa. ) both gave Trump ’ s proposal some encouraging though noncommittal words Thursday . Thune said through a spokesman that he “ supports enacting a national infrastructure improvement plan , ” while a spokesman for Shuster ’ s committee said he ’ s “ encouraged … that the idea of addressing transportation is gaining some traction in Washington . ”

The federal deficit is on track to its lowest level as a percentage of the economy since 2007, and the economy is stronger than expected.

That's the good news from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office's new economic outlook released Monday. ""Economic activity will expand at a solid pace in 2015 and over the next few years — reducing the amount of underused resources, or 'slack,' in the economy,"" the report said.

There is, though, the perennial bad news: huge deficits in later years, driven primarily by an aging population supported by fewer working-age Americans. By 2025, the federal deficit will reach $1.1 trillion.

The forecast of expected revenues and outlays is used by Congress as it shapes its spending bills for the year that starts Oct. 1.

The report also found that the economy is stronger now than the CBO had expected it would be in its recent forecasts, but that it would be not as strong later in the 10-year forecast window than it predicted earlier. Unemployment, currently at 5.6 percent, is expected to fall to 5.3 percent by late summer of 2017.

The CBO also found that implementing the Affordable Care Act will not be as expensive as it originally predicted when the law was passed in 2010. Instead of costing $710 billion through 2019, the complex law will only cost $571 billion through its first decade.

CBO Director Doug Elmendorf attributed the lower cost partly to the 2012 Supreme Court decision ruling that states did not have to participate in the law's expansion of Medicaid. But Elmendorf said much of the savings comes from lower health insurance costs and lower health insurance premiums over the past several years.

Many Republicans, particularly conservatives, have pushed for dynamic scoring of tax cut bills, because they believe such ""macroeconomic"" analyses would show that legislation would cost the Treasury less than traditional scoring methods show, or would even show that tax cuts actually increase tax revenue.

We are , it seems , in the age of the “ common good ” wars . Florida senator Marco Rubio helped launch the latest iteration of this debate last month in his call for a “ common-good capitalism , ” with an emphasis on markets that strengthen families and the American worker . Though Josh Hawley , the freshman Republican senator from Missouri , might not have explicitly invoked the “ common good ” in a later speech at the American Principles Project , he touched on many similar themes by stressing the importance of a common prosperity and attacking a “ Promethean ” streak of radical autonomy in contemporary American life .
These twin speeches have ignited an intense debate on the right , including at ███ . Some ( including Oren Cass and Declan Leary ) have defended this “ common-good capitalism. ” Others — including Kevin Williamson and David Harsanyi — have attacked it as some form of statism . Outside NR , Noah Rothman , Emile Doak , and Henry Olsen are among those who have weighed in on this issue .
Some proponents and some critics of this idea might be tempted to posit some opposition between the idea of the common good and the idea of liberty . In many ways , though , liberty and the common good can be allied . Civil and economic freedom can contribute to the common good , and attention to the common good ( while noble in its own right ) can also be instrumental to the preservation of our liberties .
Though some sectors of the post-liberal Right and Left have soured on the idea of “ capitalism , ” much could be said on behalf of this system for contributing to the common good . It has slashed poverty across the globe , and , as Benedict XVI has suggested in Caritas in Veritate , the diversity of employment opportunities provided in a market economy helps open up the realization of individual gifts . For all the faults of the high neoliberal era ( and there are many ) , it has also helped lift hundreds of millions out of crushing poverty . One needn ’ t be a radical utilitarian to think that this is a considerable accomplishment . The birth of the industrialized , modern market has helped nurture a modern middle class , one of the bulwarks of stable democratic governance .
As Hawley and Rubio have both noted , there are reasons to believe that trends over the past two decades have not been in the national interest — or the interest of a sustainable freedom . With skyrocketing deaths of despair , diminished GDP growth , and slipping productivity growth , the American political system is under increasing strain . Chris Arnade in his recent book Dignity chronicles the struggles ( and deep-grained resilience ) of many parts of this country . These economically hollowed-out areas are a breeding ground for human misery and political alienation .
Meanwhile , a few urban hubs — especially New York , San Francisco , and Washington , D.C. — have hoovered up many credentialed Americans with high levels of social capital . But this concentration of opportunity generates its own tensions . Ferociously battling for gold-flake-topped slices of a shrinking pie , ambitious young meritocrats find themselves in a world of long hours , vertigo-inducing costs of living , and a haunting sense of gilded precariousness . This is a perfect storm for political radicalization . With family formation and hopes of a secure middle-class life indefinitely deferred , the would-be members of the new gentry class find themselves increasingly frustrated — and they have the cultural influence to make their frustrations resonate throughout the broader political system . Much of the new radicalism is fed not by the unemployed in the economic hinterlands or inner cities but by the interns and contingent staffers at prestige institutions . Here , again , the increasing concentration of financial and cultural power encourages social conflict . As avenues for opportunity close , battles intensify for the privilege of controlling the remaining paths to influence and power . For the ideological faction that does control them , the reward grows greater .
American journalism exemplifies this tendency . The shuttering of local newsrooms across the country has led to a press corps more focused on national politics , and a financially embattled press environment places a greater premium on generating clicks and controversy than on the sober work of getting the facts right . To maintain market share , the remaining national media behemoths have favored polarization , and aspiring journalists have a motivation to feed into it . As the middle ranks of journalists are gutted , news media have been pulled between the teeming masses of the underpaid and a ( relatively ) few marquee names . One need only open a national newspaper or watch a few minutes of a cable-news broadcast to see the damage that dynamic has wrought .
National policy choices ( on trade , finance , immigration , and so forth ) have contributed to these trends , and policy choices could be made to address them . While federal policy is not the only lever for achieving some of these ends , it has an important role to play . For instance , Senator Rubio in his speech highlighted the role of an expanded child tax credit and , in general , of increased tax benefits for families with minor children .
Immigration , health care , finance , infrastructure , and even federal employment are other policy areas for such reform . Through setting immigration policy , the federal government can influence the labor market , and a tight labor market is one of the greatest boons to working families . Immigration patterns , both legal and illegal , have in recent decades increased pressure on the wages of Americans without a college degree . Compounding this trend , guest-worker programs also risk undermining the employment opportunities of American college graduates . Taking efforts to tighten the labor market for Americans ( both native-born and recent immigrants ) could broaden opportunity and facilitate social integration .
A capitalism for the common good might confront the exploding costs of health care , which weigh on American families and threaten to undermine the dynamism of the American economy as a whole . While Republicans have made considerable effort in recent decades to cut income taxes , health-care costs devour a bigger portion of the income of many American families than income taxes do . Some of the interventions in this sector might include federal subsidies to help backstop health-care financing for less affluent Americans . But some of this effort to combat health-care costs would probably also include some market-oriented measures , such as repealing “ certificate of need ” laws , breaking up medical cartels , allowing more-flexible licensing for medical professionals , and pushing for price transparency . Some medical lobbying groups might push back against some of these efforts , but they might soon face a choice between market-oriented reforms and total government control of the health-care sector . Reduction of medical costs could advance another public interest as well : making the federal budget more sustainable ( as medical spending is a significant driver of federal expenditures ) .
Many critiques of the high neoliberal era have trained their fire on financialization , and here again market principles can reinforce a common-good correction . For instance , one of the stronger arguments for reinstating some version of the Glass-Steagall separation of investment from commercial banking is that this wall of separation would fracture banking interests , thereby making it harder for one set of interests to gain excessive influence over federal legislation . The era of increased financial consolidation has made the American economy more vulnerable to systemic risk , so undoing some of that would help put the economy on sounder footing . More broadly , more-robust anti-monopoly efforts could help spur more market growth while also empowering a more diverse set of actors .
The infrastructure of the 21st century includes roads and bridges as well as digital communications . To maintain great-power status , the United States will almost certainly have to defend and extend this infrastructure . Development of it can sustain local communities and also enhance opportunities for private individuals . Moreover , protecting diverse supply-chain production networks in the United States serves both the national geopolitical interest and economic vibrancy .
Senators Hawley and Marsha Blackburn ( R. , Tenn. ) have recently proposed moving many federal agencies away from the Beltway to other parts of this country . Even relocating a few agencies could help reverse the concentration of cultural and political capital in the Beltway , while also providing new opportunities for struggling parts of the country , from inner-city Detroit to rural West Virginia . A few hundred ( or even thousand ) jobs here and there wouldn ’ t transform the American economy , but they would send a message and help diversify social capital .
While this invocation of a capitalism of the common good has struck some observers as a radical new idea , steps to address the common good are well within the mainstream of American policy . Contrary to some laissez-faire mythologies , the United States has continually used government policy to achieve certain economic ends , and it has often done so successfully . The U.S. Constitution assigns to Congress the ability to create copyright and patent laws in order to encourage innovation , for instance . Industrial policy of a kind is as old as Alexander Hamilton , and , in the 19th century , the “ American school ” of economics ( championed by Clay , Lincoln , and others ) helped build the United States into an economic colossus . In the 20th century , Republicans and Democrats alike ( from Coolidge to FDR to Reagan ) used federal efforts to achieve certain economic aims . The victories in the two world wars and in the Cold War can be attributed in part to skill and foresight in economic policy . The talents , insights , and hard work of millions of Americans were , of course , indispensible for achieving these ends , but government policy helped create an environment where those capabilities could flourish .
Now , this doesn ’ t always mean that individual economic-policy efforts will be successful , or that they will not have unforeseen complications . In the 1970s , neoconservatives identified some of the failures of the Great Society welfare state while also seeking to preserve core elements of the social safety net . A gimlet eye should be applied as well to other efforts to implement economic policy . However , the challenges of crafting useful economic policy are not a reason for giving up on economic policy .
This attention to the common good would mean not a surrender to socialism but rather a way of averting it . In the United States , the socioeconomic disruptions of the high neoliberal era have done more to advance the cause of socialism than have a thousand radical broadsides . Providing a greater sense of economic security could help deflate more revolutionary projects .
Such federal policies would not be a panacea for deeper cultural issues ( such as despair , isolation , and angst ) , but they could at least partially address them . A janitor who has more benefits and higher pay — perhaps because of unionization or a tighter labor market — might be able to move out of his parents ’ basement and start a life on his own . A young couple who don ’ t have to move to a coastal metropolis to make a living but instead can stay close to home might find it easier to get married and start a family ; lower costs of living and a closer kin network make the prospect of young children seem more manageable . When Mom and Dad don ’ t have to pick up an extra shift to pay for sky-high health-care expenses , they might have more time to volunteer with the Little League team or at the local church .
Attention to the common good and the defense of liberty need not be opposed impulses . In practice , they can be complementary ones . Political liberty depends on certain underlying social conditions , and a regime that wants to make such a liberty sustainable will have to attend to them . State action is not the only vehicle for defending them , but it can , in certain circumstances , be a vehicle . The protection of our private liberties depends in no small part on our attention to the commonwealth .","Grand Central Station in New York City (Pexels)

In the 20th century, Republicans and Democrats alike (from Coolidge to FDR to Reagan) used federal efforts to achieve certain economic aims. The victories in the two world wars and in the Cold War can be attributed in part to skill and foresight in economic policy. The talents, insights, and hard work of millions of Americans were, of course, indispensible for achieving these ends, but government policy helped create an environment where those capabilities could flourish.

Now, this doesn’t always mean that individual economic-policy efforts will be successful, or that they will not have unforeseen complications. In the 1970s, neoconservatives identified some of the failures of the Great Society welfare state while also seeking to preserve core elements of the social safety net. A gimlet eye should be applied as well to other efforts to implement economic policy. However, the challenges of crafting useful economic policy are not a reason for giving up on economic policy.

This attention to the common good would mean not a surrender to socialism but rather a way of averting it. In the United States, the socioeconomic disruptions of the high neoliberal era have done more to advance the cause of socialism than have a thousand radical broadsides. Providing a greater sense of economic security could help deflate more revolutionary projects.

Such federal policies would not be a panacea for deeper cultural issues (such as despair, isolation, and angst), but they could at least partially address them. A janitor who has more benefits and higher pay — perhaps because of unionization or a tighter labor market — might be able to move out of his parents’ basement and start a life on his own. A young couple who don’t have to move to a coastal metropolis to make a living but instead can stay close to home might find it easier to get married and start a family; lower costs of living and a closer kin network make the prospect of young children seem more manageable. When Mom and Dad don’t have to pick up an extra shift to pay for sky-high health-care expenses, they might have more time to volunteer with the Little League team or at the local church.

Attention to the common good and the defense of liberty need not be opposed impulses. In practice, they can be complementary ones. Political liberty depends on certain underlying social conditions, and a regime that wants to make such a liberty sustainable will have to attend to them. State action is not the only vehicle for defending them, but it can, in certain circumstances, be a vehicle. The protection of our private liberties depends in no small part on our attention to the commonwealth.",www.nationalreview.com,right,aajdiaHpxN7IyCon

Rand Paul is , once again , confused . Recently , he told a Chamber of Commerce gathering that being `` married with kids versus unmarried with kids is the difference between living in poverty and not , '' and that the government `` should sell that message . ''
Sen. Marco Rubio is similarly flummoxed . `` The truth is , '' he said , `` that the greatest tool to lift people ... from poverty is one that decreases child poverty by 82 percent . But it is n't a government program . It 's called marriage . Fifty years ago today , when the War on Poverty was launched , 93 percent of children in the United States were born to married parents . By 2010 , that number had plummeted to 60 percent . It should n't surprise us that 71 percent of poor families with children are families that are not headed by a married couple . ''
Conservative pundits , for their part , are falling in line , with the Washington Post ’ s Kathleen Parker claiming that “ marriage creates a tiny economy fueled by a magical concoction of love , selflessness and permanent commitment that holds spirits aloft during tough times. ” The New York Times ’ Ross Douthat takes for granted that marriage leads to economic stability , and David Brooks has simply thrown up his hands : `` It would be great if we knew how to boost marriage rates , but we do n't , '' he writes .
So why do n't poor women take that simple step , get married and end their poverty ? The answer , of course , is that things are not so simple , and that despite conservative ideology 's faith in it , marriage is not the cure for poverty .
It was the legendary sociologist William Julius Wilson who uncovered the real reason that poor women stopped marrying , when he posed the Rubio-Paul question in the 1980s . The difference is that , unlike Rubio and Paul , Wilson answered the question with research , not ideology .
Wilson began by noticing that the birth rate among poor urban teenagers was actually declining -- but that the rate of out of wedlock births among them was increasing . Fewer teens were having children , but those who did were no longer getting married . Why ?
Wilson noticed that these trends were occurring at the same time that other changes were blindsiding the cities : The first was the flight of the factories , and of good jobs for unskilled workers . The result was immediate : In 1970 , only five Chicago neighborhoods knew a rate of 15 percent unemployment or more . By 1980 , 25 neighborhoods were so afflicted .
As its working class became jobless , the neighborhood 's middle class -- the doctors , lawyers , store owners and so on who had served that working class -- joined the exodus . Left behind were what Wilson called `` the truly disadvantaged '' -- cut off from jobs , from interaction with a middle class , from decent schools . Gang activity and crime rates increased . In the nation 's five largest cities , the poverty population increased by a staggering 161 percent in extreme poverty areas ( those with a poverty rate of at least 40 percent ) . Poverty had not just increased , it was now concentrated and segregated .
In these neighborhoods -- lacking good schools , a middle class or jobs for unskilled workers , neighborhoods where so many young men died or were incarcerated -- the `` male marriageable pool index , '' the percentage of young men able to support a family , declined sharply . So did marriage rates .
Wilson 's discoveries have been reinforced by a substantial body of subsequent research . For example , a new study by a Harvard team featuring Emmanuel Saez ( a discoverer of the 1 percent 's recent engorgement ) and recent MacArthur `` genius '' grant winner Raj Chetty finds that segregation of the poor from good jobs , schools and neighborhoods remains one of the biggest impediments to upward mobility .
Wilson 's discovery that marriage is no panacea for poor women has also been reaffirmed by recent research . Research conducted by Kristi Williams at Ohio State University found that `` [ t ] he flaw in this argument [ that marriage creates prosperity ] is the assumption that all marriages are equally beneficial . In fact , however , the pool of potential marriage partners for single mothers in impoverished communities does not include many men with good prospects for becoming stable and helpful partners . '' In fact , a national study of more than 7,000 women found that 64 percent of single mothers who married were divorced by the time they reached 35-44 . What 's more , those who married and then divorced were worse off , on average , than single mothers who had never married . Given this finding , should Douthat really be calling for `` more imperfect unions '' ?
Indeed , research shows , the very nostrum Rand Paul proposed , that government should `` sell this message '' of marriage as the path to prosperity , has been tried and found wanting . Analyzing outcomes of the 1996 Welfare Reform law , which allowed states to spend federal dollars on marriage promotion , a a recent federal study found that `` no long term improvements in marriage rates or children 's economic well-being '' accrued from these efforts . What ’ s clear is that unmarried mothers know something Paul , Rubio and their Op-Ed page cheerleaders don ’ t -- that marriage isn ’ t a cure-all for the economic woes of single-parent families .
Fortunately , thanks again to research , we know not only what does n't alleviate poverty , but also what does . This time it 's a cross-cultural study , showing that the U.S. poverty rate for single-parent families is nearly twice that of the average in a comparison of 16 relatively affluent nations . Three factors make those families better off in other countries than they are in the U.S : The first is family allowances ; the U.S. offers the stingiest of these . The second is paid parental leave , and the third is publicly funded childcare .
Are these too much to ask in a moment of gridlock and deficits ? A final study calls for creative small-ball . This one begins by noting that an astounding 79 percent of births to single women under the age of 25 are unintended , and that comprehensive sex education , safe and affordable access to contraception and medical care have been shown to be effective in reducing unplanned pregnancy .
It has now been over a decade since Karl Rove told a reporter that `` the reality-based community , '' which `` believes that solutions emerge from your judicious study of reality , '' had been trumped by the right , by `` history 's actors '' and their conservative ideology .

economic_policy,International Business Times,1,http://www.ibtimes.com/obama-economy-speech-why-presidents-plan-wont-get-past-republicans-1359187,Obama Economy Speech: Why The President's Plan Won't Get Past Republicans,2013-07-24,,"President Barack Obama sought to change the narrative on Capitol Hill and the nation on Wednesday , with a much-anticipated economic speech at Knox College in Illinois , the first in a series of speeches he wants to give about his vision for rebuilding the economy .
Stepping out ahead of what is shaping up to be a heated debt-ceiling showdown in the fall , Obama spoke of the progress made and the challenges ahead , and offered his solutions , based on building out from the middle class -- a concept that has stuck with the president since his first term in office .
“ When middle-class families have less to spend , businesses have fewer customers , ” Obama said . “ When wealth concentrates at the very top , it can inflate unstable bubbles that threaten the economy . ... That ’ s why reversing these trends must be Washington ’ s highest priority . It ’ s certainly my highest priority . Unfortunately , over the past couple of years in particular , Washington hasn ’ t just ignored the problem ; too often , it ’ s made things worse . ”
Obama wants to do these things to help strengthen the middle class :
-- Promote new initiatives so that manufacturers can bring additional jobs back home and create jobs in the energy sector ;
-- Have high-quality pre-school for every 4-year-old across the nation ;
-- Work on his own to remove red tape for responsible families who want a mortgage but can ’ t get one ;
-- Tackle the rising cost of higher education , and helping to get people out of poverty ; and
Obama senior advisor Dan Pfeiffer revealed on Sunday that job security , education , homeownership , healthcare , and saving will form the cornerstone of these speeches . “ They will include new ideas and new pushes for ideas he has discussed before , ” he wrote in a post . “ They ’ ll outline steps Congress can take , steps he ’ ll take on his own , and steps the private sector can take that benefit us all . The point is to chart a course for where America needs to go -- not just in the next three months or even the next three years , but a steady , persistent effort over the long term to restore this country ’ s basic bargain for the middle class . ”
But Republicans are showing reluctance to many of Obama ’ s proposals . They have been doing so for a long time , in fact . At the moment , congressional Republicans are focused on gutting the Affordable Care Act , commonly called Obamacare , which they have tried unsuccessfully to repeal more than 30 times and now want to defund ; they have no intention of raising the debt ceiling or eliminating it altogether ; they also don ’ t want to hear about raising any taxes . What they want is the spending cuts promised to them in the deal for raising taxes on upper income brackets earlier this year , and it appears they are willing to do anything to get it , even shut down the government if Obamacare gets one dime .
“ Well , welcome to the conversation , Mr. President , we ’ ve never left it , ” Boehner said at a press conference on Tuesday . “ We ’ ve been focused on jobs for the last two and half years -- actually , longer than that -- but the two and half years we ’ ve been in the majority . ”
If Obama was serious about helping the economy , Boehner said , he wouldn ’ t be taking the podium instead of reaching out and working with Republicans . So the trust deficit between the two sides continues . “ This is all about a big setup that ’ s coming in this speech , ” he added . “ The president wants to raise taxes so he can do more ‘ stimulus ’ spending .

Two key parts of the president ’ s second-term agenda , gun control and immigration reform , have either been destroyed or stunted , but he ’ s refusing to back down on the issue of the economy , which is still recovering slowly .

“ I think it ’ s a more pressing issue than the things Washington has spent most of the last year discussing , ” said Michael Strain , an economist at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute . “ I hope the president has some ideas and policies and some thoughts to share with the country about how to put Americans back to work . ”
But Strain isn ’ t optimistic that Congress will work with the president and across party lines to pass any significant pieces of legislation . “ External events could force the hand of the government , ” he said , “ but these guys aren ’ t playing nicely together and that ’ s somewhat discouraging . ”
Still , Strain thinks there are policy solutions that both Democrats and Republicans can get behind to start making some real changes : reforming the unemployment system ; bring in more high-skilled immigrants , whether through comprehensive immigration reform or a separate jobs plan ; reduce barriers for potential entrepreneurs ; and even temporarily eliminating capital-gain taxes on new business investments , to help potential entrepreneurs attract capital .
Like Strain , Lance Roberts , chief economist at Street Talk Advisors , believes both parties working together can solve some of the problems . Over the next three years , said Roberts , economic growth will still be pretty much sluggish as long as the policies now in place remain or new ones do n't lead to further economic restraints .
For him , there ’ s no doubt federal bailouts and other programs under the Obama administration prevented an economic depression , but getting people into full-time employment must be the focus now . That would lead to increased consumer confidence and spending .
But the president alone isn ’ t to blame , Roberts said , adding decades of bad decisions that begun under President Reagan play a role . “ We are just in the back end cycle of a long policy of bad fiscal decisions and increasing debt and running deficits to no end , ” he said . “ So now we are dealing with the deleterious effects on the economy of those previous decisions . ”
The key , though , is getting Americans to a place where they can spend money again . “ Consumption is what we need to drive economic growth , ” Roberts said .","President Barack Obama sought to change the narrative on Capitol Hill and the nation on Wednesday, with a much-anticipated economic speech at Knox College in Illinois, the first in a series of speeches he wants to give about his vision for rebuilding the economy.

Stepping out ahead of what is shaping up to be a heated debt-ceiling showdown in the fall, Obama spoke of the progress made and the challenges ahead, and offered his solutions, based on building out from the middle class -- a concept that has stuck with the president since his first term in office.

“When middle-class families have less to spend, businesses have fewer customers,” Obama said. “When wealth concentrates at the very top, it can inflate unstable bubbles that threaten the economy. ... That’s why reversing these trends must be Washington’s highest priority. It’s certainly my highest priority. Unfortunately, over the past couple of years in particular, Washington hasn’t just ignored the problem; too often, it’s made things worse.”

Obama wants to do these things to help strengthen the middle class:

-- Promote new initiatives so that manufacturers can bring additional jobs back home and create jobs in the energy sector;

-- Have high-quality pre-school for every 4-year-old across the nation;

-- Work on his own to remove red tape for responsible families who want a mortgage but can’t get one;

-- Tackle the rising cost of higher education, and helping to get people out of poverty; and

-- Implement the Affordable Care Act.

Obama senior advisor Dan Pfeiffer revealed on Sunday that job security, education, homeownership, healthcare, and saving will form the cornerstone of these speeches. “They will include new ideas and new pushes for ideas he has discussed before,” he wrote in a post. “They’ll outline steps Congress can take, steps he’ll take on his own, and steps the private sector can take that benefit us all. The point is to chart a course for where America needs to go --not just in the next three months or even the next three years, but a steady, persistent effort over the long term to restore this country’s basic bargain for the middle class.”

But Republicans are showing reluctance to many of Obama’s proposals. They have been doing so for a long time, in fact. At the moment, congressional Republicans are focused on gutting the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare, which they have tried unsuccessfully to repeal more than 30 times and now want to defund; they have no intention of raising the debt ceiling or eliminating it altogether; they also don’t want to hear about raising any taxes.

Nationwide, the economy is the number one issue for voters.

Trump is winning their confidence without specific economic proposals. So far voters are simply cheering his promise to bring back jobs in manufacturing and coal mining while ending trade deals that allow big companies like Nabisco to leave the USA to make cookies with cheaper workers in Mexico.

Trump’s message echoes the dismal economic drumbeat on conservative talk radio, television and web sites. Among the right-wing faithful, Obama is considered a failure for his handling of the economy.

The only problem here is the facts.

Since Obama took office in the middle of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, the economy has added over 14.6 million private sector jobs. There have been 75 straight months of private job growth.

The current unemployment rate is 5 percent; effectively full employment. In March 2016, the labor force participation rate — people with jobs and people looking for work because they believe they can find a job — was at its highest level in almost two years.

Talks between the two countries fell apart last month , with Mr. Trump accusing China of reneging on a trade deal and China insisting that the United States was not negotiating in good faith .
Tensions have since increased as Mr. Trump raised tariffs on $ 250 billion worth of Chinese goods and threatened to tax nearly all Chinese imports . Beijing has responded with higher tariffs on American goods , and in a white paper released last Sunday , Chinese officials vowed to “ never give in ” on issues of principle .

Talks between the two countries fell apart last month, with Mr. Trump accusing China of reneging on a trade deal and China insisting that the United States was not negotiating in good faith.

Tensions have since increased as Mr. Trump raised tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods and threatened to tax nearly all Chinese imports. Beijing has responded with higher tariffs on American goods, and in a white paper released last Sunday, Chinese officials vowed to “never give in” on issues of principle.

economic_policy,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/4/obama-growing-income-inequality-defining-challenge/,Obama: Growing income inequality ‘defining challenge’ of this generation,2013-12-04,Ben Wolfgang,"Turning his attention yet again to the economy , President Obama on Wednesday zeroed in on the “ defining challenge ” of this generation — growing income inequality between the richest 1 percent and the rest of America .
But the president didn ’ t unveil any grand proposals to tackle the problem ; instead , he repeated a laundry list of initiatives centered on many familiar themes : economic growth through government investment ; job training and education reform ; stronger protections for labor unions and paycheck fairness legislation ; a hike to the minimum wage ; and a revamped approach to how Americans save for retirement in private accounts and in government programs such as Social Security .
Although his speech was short on specific ideas , it was big on ambition . The president talked in broad terms about how the greatest nation on earth must not allow the middle class to stagnate and the poor to get poorer as rich Americans ’ net worth grows .
“ I believe this is the defining challenge of our time — making sure our economy works for every working American . That ’ s why I ran for president , ” Mr. Obama said at an event in Southeast Washington hosted by the left-leaning Center for American Progress . “ It drives everything I do in this office . I know I ’ ve raised this issue before and some will ask why I raise the issue again right now . I do it because the outcomes of the debates we ’ re having right now , whether it ’ s health care , or the budget , or reforming our housing and financial systems , all of these things will have real practical implications for every American . I am convinced the decisions we make on these issues over the next few years will determine whether our children grow up in an America where opportunity is real . ”
Pointing out widening income disparities is not new for Mr. Obama , who spoke of the issue often during both of his presidential campaigns . Indeed , it has become a focal point of politics in the U.S. and led some leaders such as former Sen. John Edwards , North Carolina Democrat , to declare there are “ two Americas ” — one for the rich and another for everyone else .
The question isn ’ t whether income inequality should be addressed , analysts say , but how the problem should be approached . On that front , they say , Mr. Obama simply is offering more of the same .
“ What I heard was the same old , very broad brush strokes : We need to help the middle class , we need to raise the minimum wage and we need to do more infrastructure projects . More spending , ” said Lance Roberts , CEO of STA Wealth Management who has more than 25 years of experience in private banking , investment management and venture capital .
“ Let ’ s throw money at it , ” Mr. Roberts said of the administration ’ s approach to income disparities and a generally poor economy . “ If it doesn ’ t work , it ’ s because we didn ’ t throw enough money at it . We ’ ve done five years of this . ”
In those five years , income inequality has hit a record level , according to a September report from the University of California , Berkeley . The study shows that income gaps continue to grow despite the administration ’ s intentions .
From 2009 to 2012 , the top 1 percent of incomes in the U.S. grew by more than 31 percent , while the bottom 99 percent went up by 0.4 percent . During the same period , the top 1 percent of earners captured 95 percent of all income gains .
In 2012 , as Mr. Obama neared the end of his first term that imposed massive government investment through his stimulus package , the top 1 percent of American incomes rose by nearly 20 percent while the bottom 99 percent of incomes grew by just 1 percent , according to the Berkeley report .
Republicans seized on the president ’ s remarks and framed them against the backdrop of such grim income statistics .
“ The American dream is certainly more in doubt than in decades , but after more than five years in office , the president has no one to blame but himself , ” said Brendan Buck , a spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican .
The president ’ s approach is “ more stimulus , more government programs and more government intervention into the job-creating private sector , ” Mr. Buck said . “ By now , and by the president ’ s own admission , it should be clear that is not the solution . ”
Income inequality usually is framed in purely economic terms , but the president cast it in a broader light and said it poses a fundamental threat to American democracy .
“ Ordinary folks can ’ t write massive campaign checks or hire high-priced lobbyists and lawyers to secure policies that tilt the playing field in their favor at everyone else ’ s expense , ” he said . “ So people get the bad taste that the system is rigged . That increases cynicism and polarization and it decreases the political participation that is a requisite part of our system of self-governing . ”","Turning his attention yet again to the economy, President Obama on Wednesday zeroed in on the “defining challenge” of this generation — growing income inequality between the richest 1 percent and the rest of America.

On the heels of a better-than-expected quarter of GDP growth ( the US economy has grown at an average clip of better than three percent since the GOP tax reform law was implemented ) , even a Trump-skeptical to -hostile electorate can recognize prosperity when they see it . And the man at the top is getting credit :
CNN poll : Trump +15 on the economy , +4 on keeping promises . https : //t.co/1zW0e47qs1 — Guy Benson ( @ guypbenson ) May 2 , 2019
President Trump ’ s approval rating on the economy has hit a new high , according to a CNN poll released on Thursday . A majority of respondents — 56 percent — said they approve of Trump ’ s handling of the economy , compared with 41 percent who disapproved . The president 's previous high mark on the economy in the CNN poll came in March 2017 , when 55 percent approved of his work .
I also find this nugget interesting : `` Fifty percent of those polled in the new survey said he has done a good job at keeping the promises the made on the campaign trail . Forty-six percent said he had done a poor job and 4 percent had no opinion . '' This has to be welcome news to the re-elect team , considering Trump 's repeated use of the slogan , `` promises made , promises kept . '' A majority of voters apparently agree . As for the downsides , the president is upside-down on healthcare ( 38 percent approval ) and immigration ( 42 percent approval ) -- and his overall job approval rating , despite hitting its best mark in this polling series in a year , is still only 43 percent . Fifty-two percent disapprove . As I 've said before , Trump 's re-election will depend on the economy 's continued thriving , and his ability to win over a significant chunk of voters who approve of him on that issue , in spite of their qualms about his leadership on the whole .
It could certainly help his cause that leading Democratic presidential hopefuls continue to call for large tax increases on the middle class , having swallowed their own dishonest talking points about the Trump-signed tax cuts . As a refresher , 80 percent of all Americans received a tax cut in 2018 thanks to the new law , including roughly 91 percent of middle class filers . Repealing that law , as Democrats are demanding , would jack up taxes on the lopsided majority of the electorate . Joe Biden got in on the act , falsely claiming that tax reform merely benefited the rich and corporations , earning himself Four Pinocchios from the Washington Post 's fact checker :
WaPo Fact checker : Biden ’ s false claim that no one but the rich got Trump ’ s tax cuts https : //t.co/AqSGJLpklt — Jake Tapper ( @ jaketapper ) May 1 , 2019
“ There ’ s a $ 2 trillion tax cut last year . Did you feel it ? Did you get anything from it ? Of course not . Of course not . All of it went to folks at the top and corporations . ”
`` That 's simply wrong , '' the Post concludes . Indeed it is , and by agitating for repeal , Democrats run the political risk of being accurately painted as middle class tax-raisers . That would be the literal consequence of their preferred policy outcome .

Here 's Mitch McConnell talking up that progress , some of which he attributes to the `` modest step '' we analyzed last month :","As usual, there are some worrisome data points in a generally Trump-positive poll, but start with the good news for the president: A new national survey from CNN shows public support for his handling of the economy hitting a new high, with Trump also above water on another important metric. On the heels of a better-than-expected quarter of GDP growth (the US economy has grown at an average clip of better than three percent since the GOP tax reform law was implemented), even a Trump-skeptical to -hostile electorate can recognize prosperity when they see it. And the man at the top is getting credit:

CNN poll: Trump +15 on the economy, +4 on keeping promises. https://t.co/1zW0e47qs1 — Guy Benson (@guypbenson) May 2, 2019

President Trump’s approval rating on the economy has hit a new high, according to a CNN poll released on Thursday. A majority of respondents — 56 percent — said they approve of Trump’s handling of the economy, compared with 41 percent who disapproved. The president's previous high mark on the economy in the CNN poll came in March 2017, when 55 percent approved of his work.

I also find this nugget interesting: ""Fifty percent of those polled in the new survey said he has done a good job at keeping the promises the made on the campaign trail. Forty-six percent said he had done a poor job and 4 percent had no opinion."" This has to be welcome news to the re-elect team, considering Trump's repeated use of the slogan, ""promises made, promises kept."" A majority of voters apparently agree. As for the downsides, the president is upside-down on healthcare (38 percent approval) and immigration (42 percent approval) -- and his overall job approval rating, despite hitting its best mark in this polling series in a year, is still only 43 percent. Fifty-two percent disapprove. As I've said before, Trump's re-election will depend on the economy's continued thriving, and his ability to win over a significant chunk of voters who approve of him on that issue, in spite of their qualms about his leadership on the whole.

It could certainly help his cause that leading Democratic presidential hopefuls continue to call for large tax increases on the middle class, having swallowed their own dishonest talking points about the Trump-signed tax cuts. As a refresher, 80 percent of all Americans received a tax cut in 2018 thanks to the new law, including roughly 91 percent of middle class filers. Repealing that law, as Democrats are demanding, would jack up taxes on the lopsided majority of the electorate. Joe Biden got in on the act, falsely claiming that tax reform merely benefited the rich and corporations, earning himself Four Pinocchios from the Washington Post's fact checker:

WaPo Fact checker: Biden’s false claim that no one but the rich got Trump’s tax cuts https://t.co/AqSGJLpklt — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) May 1, 2019

“There’s a $2 trillion tax cut last year. Did you feel it? Did you get anything from it? Of course not. Of course not. All of it went to folks at the top and corporations.”

""That's simply wrong,"" the Post concludes. Indeed it is, and by agitating for repeal, Democrats run the political risk of being accurately painted as middle class tax-raisers. That would be the literal consequence of their preferred policy outcome.

Today , that number is 60 percent . Another recent poll shows that only 42 percent of millennials support capitalism .
So what happened ? Why have so many people , both in the US and abroad , lost faith in capitalism ?
Steven Pearlstein , a columnist for the Washington Post and public affairs professor at George Mason University , has a few answers . The primary reason is that the system has become too unstable : Wages are largely stagnant , and the income gap is so wide that the rich and the poor effectively live in different worlds . No surprise , then , that people are unhappy with the status quo .
Pearlstein ’ s new book , Can American Capitalism Survive ? , chronicles the excesses of capitalism and shows how its ethical foundations have been shattered by a radical free market ideology — often referred to as “ neoliberalism. ” Capitalism isn ’ t dead , Pearlstein argues , but it has to be saved from itself before it ’ s too late .
I spoke to him about how we might do that , whether capitalism is even worth salvaging at this point , and why he thinks America needs a new social contract between business and society .
The most obvious answer is that capitalism has left a lot of people behind in the last 30 years . Everyone can see that the top 1 percent , the top 10 percent , the top 20 percent , have captured most of the benefits of economic growth over the last 30 years , and the rest of the population has been marginalized .
Now , we all know this , but I wrote the book because I think there is a feeling even among those of us who didn ’ t get left behind that this system has become too unfair , too ruthless , and rewards too many of the things we think of as bad . The system offends the moral sensibilities even of people who are benefiting from it .
I ’ m not so sure that the people at the top are starting to see it that way , but we ’ ll come back to that . First , tell me what went wrong in the 1970s and ’ 80s , when you say capitalism really started to go sideways .
Two things happened during the ’ 70s and ’ 80s . First , the American industrial economy lost its competitiveness . Neoliberal policies of global free trade and unregulated markets were embraced , and the US was suddenly facing competition from all over the globe .
So American companies , which had been so dominant in our own market and in foreign markets , started to lose their dominance , and they had to get leaner and meaner . They started behaving in different ways . They started sharing less profits with their employees and with shareholders and customers .
Eventually , that produced a revolt from shareholders , and in the mid- ’ 80s we had the first of what were called “ hostile takeovers , ” in which people would come in and buy up large chunks of companies and threaten to take them over or out the executives if they didn ’ t put shareholders above all else .
The result of all this was that companies changed how they did business and completely embraced the idea that companies should be run to maximize shareholder value and nothing else . Obviously , that meant more money for executives and shareholders and less money for employees and customers .
This is the mentality that led us to the place we ’ re in now .
“ This is not a sustainable system , and if it keeps getting worse , we run the risk of a revolution ”
I want to push you on what I think is an excessively sanguine view of capitalism . In the book , you imply that capitalism has gone off the rails , but I disagree . I ’ d argue that capitalism has evolved in precisely the way we should have expected it to evolve . The culture of norms and values that were supposed to check the excesses of capitalism has ( predictably ) been eroded by capitalism itself , and now it ’ s propelled entirely by greed .
You seem to think that capitalism can be saved from itself . What do you say to people who think it ’ s not salvageable , not morally legitimate , and in any case not worth salvaging ?
The question is , is all of that endemic to capitalism ? I don ’ t think so , because we see different kinds of capitalism in countries in , say , Northern Europe and in Germany . Some of that has to do with the rules and laws under which they operate , but a lot of it has to do with the norms of behavior . So capitalism doesn ’ t have to reach the point of ruthlessness like it has here and other places .
And one of the good things about capitalism is that it has self-correcting mechanisms , just as democracy has self-correcting mechanisms . The truth is that the outcome we have now , all of this tremendous inequality , is bad morally and economically . This is not a sustainable system , and if it keeps getting worse , we run the risk of a revolution .
So I don ’ t think capitalism is an inherently moral system or an inherently self-defeating system , but we have to ensure that it adapts when it veers too far into corruption and inequality . And that ’ s basically what I ’ m calling for in this book .
Well , yes , capitalist systems are extremely adaptable ( that ’ s definitely one thing Karl Marx got really , really wrong ) , but the problem is that our system isn ’ t adapting , or not adapting fast enough . And we live in a media culture in which nearly half the population is fed propaganda that convinces them that immigrants and regulations are what are holding them back , not greedy corporations .
How do we course-correct in the face of all this confusion ?
We do it by changing norms , and by talking about it and discussing it . That ’ s how a democracy goes about it . Now one of the questions you might ask is , how do norms change ? And the answer is , I don ’ t know .
But in the # MeToo movement , we see a very good example of how norms can change very quickly . What was acceptable five years ago is really not acceptable anymore . And it ’ s because enough people got morally outraged and things changed . That ’ s how norms shift and the culture evolves .
I ’ ll circle back to the # MeToo comparison because I think it ’ s a bad one , but there are also legal and structural impediments here . We have a political system fueled by private money , which means that wealth translates to political influence , which in turn means the laws are increasingly rigged to benefit the people on top .
You make a very good point , and in the book I say the No . 1 thing we have to do is get money out of politics — and that will probably require a constitutional amendment . But you ’ re right : We can ’ t reform our economic system if we don ’ t reform our political financing system .
As it is now , we ’ re stuck in a vicious cycle in which concentration of wealth leads to concentration of political power , which leads to yet more concentration of wealth . And we know how this plays out in the long run — it leads to revolution . But we don ’ t have to get anywhere near that if we can make the changes we need to make now .
The Democratic Party will have to lead the way , and if they really want to do that , they need to put this at the top of their agenda and run on it . People out there are angry , and this will help them win . It ’ s a slam-dunk issue , really . People are as disgusted by what they ’ re seeing as you and I are .
I want to quote something interesting from your book : “ Liberal critics never miss an opportunity to complain about the level of inequality , but they ’ ve rarely been willing to say what level , or what kinds , of inequality would be morally acceptable. ” I have my own answer to this , but I ’ m curious what you think the acceptable level of inequality is .
My answer has to do with something called social capital , which is a social science term that generally refers to the amount of trust that we all have in each other and in our institutions . And when things get so unfair that that trust becomes eroded , that ’ s when you know you ’ ve gone too far . That ’ s when you know that things have become too unequal . Another way that you would know it is when you see class mobility , intergenerational class mobility , start to decline .
Now , we ’ ve only been in this neoliberal paradigm for 40 years , so it ’ s a little too early to know what the intergenerational data will look like , but we can already see the gross inequalities and the erosion of social capital . That , to me , is enough of a warning sign . We know enough to know we have to course-correct or risk disaster .
“ The system offends the moral sensibilities even of people who are benefiting from it ”
In the book , you catalogue all of these solutions to the problem — more income redistribution , better tax reform , something like a universal basic income , a new social contract between business and society , more access to higher education , etc . — and I agree with most of it . But I ’ m not confident we have the political will to get these things done .
If I ’ m right about that , what do you think is going to happen in the short to medium term ?
First , let me just say that it will be easier to do these sorts of things than it will be to go full socialist . If we lack the political will to fix the kind of capitalism we have , then there ’ s surely a higher political barrier to the full socialist model of national health insurance , free college for everybody , and guaranteed income for every individual , whether they work or not .
So if you ’ re saying that things have to get worse before they get better , you may be right . However , if you look at public opinion polls , if you look at the recent election , I think the will may be already there . Again , I see the success of the # MeToo movement as a great example of what ’ s possible .
The # MeToo movement is a misguided comparison . We ’ re talking about broad changes in our political and economic system , changes that directly threaten the most entrenched financial interests in this country . I think you ’ re right about public sentiment , but I ’ m not at all convinced that the financial class is prepared to relinquish anything .
In fact , we ’ ve seen the big banks essentially go right back to the sorts of behaviors that produced the financial crash in 2008 , and we just saw Republicans pass an egregious tax cut that will deepen the very inequalities we ’ re talking about here .
Well , it ’ s worth remembering that social norms change before policy changes , not the other way around . But yes , I agree that the GOP tax cut was enormously irresponsible and unfair . These are the sorts of things that can cause the public to say , “ Enough is enough . ”
My view is that we ’ re at a tipping point now and things are about to change . You and I may disagree about what , exactly , we need to do , or how far we need to go , but I think there are enough positive signs in public opinion that suggest we ’ re at a tipping point .","A decade ago, 80 percent of Americans believed that a free market economy was the best economic system.

Everyone can see that the top 1 percent, the top 10 percent, the top 20 percent, have captured most of the benefits of economic growth over the last 30 years, and the rest of the population has been marginalized.

Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and something of a ringleader in the search for a bipartisan deficit deal, has also embraced the idea.

But with the presidential campaign over, it is taking on new salience. The Democratic centrist group Third Way has made it the centerpiece of a package of tax changes that it says could raise nearly $1.3 trillion over 10 years without raising rates.

The Third Way proposal would limit tax deductions to $35,000 but would exclude charitable giving. Universities, foundations and other philanthropies have been the biggest impediment to passing Mr. Obama’s more modest 28 percent limit, which did not exclude the charitable tax deduction.",www.nytimes.com,left,15NFmOwT4NmUqItW

As 2019 comes to a close, American policymakers must face a harsh truth: The last decade was an economic disaster. If the 2020s are going to be any better, our leaders will have to learn from their mistakes — or simply be replaced.

For all the talk of recovery, this decade began with the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression. Unemployment spiked to 10 percent, and it took most of the last ten years for it to come back down. As nice as a 3.5 percent unemployment rate is, it's also something that almost never happens.

Furthermore, our current good times look a less good under the surface. The government's definition of unemployment can leave out a lot of people. This year, the portion of people who got jobs each month who wouldn't even have been counted among the unemployed the month before reached 75 percent. That's by far the highest it's been in the last three decades. The percentage of working-age Americans who have jobs only returned to its pre-Great Recession peak in the last few months. (It still has a ways to go before it returns to its previous peak, just before the 2001 recession.)

Beyond that, job quality — in terms of pay, benefits, hours, security, and more — has also deteriorated. Employment may be widely available again, but a lot of that employment is fundamentally worse than it was in decades past. Americans' wages still aren't growing as fast as they were before the crash, according to both the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Atlanta Fed. In fact, the Atlanta Fed finds that wage growth's peak in 2007 never got as high as its peak in 2000 — a similar pattern to prime-age employment.

Once the recovery from 2008 began, the economy just started growing again at a permanently lower trend line. Trillions-worth of annual economic activity — jobs, wealth creation, living standards — simply vanished this decade, with no sign we will ever recover.

To a large extent, all of these problems boil down to a failure to run the economy hot enough. There was never enough spending out there to justify hiring everyone who wanted to work; which meant businesses were never under pressure to raise wages to compete with each other for labor, or to raise their productivity to stay ahead of rising labor costs.

How did this happen?

First off: government spending. Public investment in things like infrastructure, research and development, education, and more is an enormous source of demand for the economy. Same goes for the welfare state, which supplies Americans with hundreds of billions to collectively spend. Indeed, a lot of welfare state spending is designed to automatically increase during recessions — providing economic recoveries with extra juice.

Left without federal support, state governments reduced their own spending, which undercut the recovery even more. From 2015 to 2017, the government ceased harming the economy, and after 2017 federal spending became a significant positive contributor to growth again. But by then the damage was done.

We can lay a lot of blame for this on the Republican Party, which was mendaciously hell-bent on austerity when Democrats held the White House, but happy to strike big spending deals once they were back in power.

And of course the Democrats remain terrified of ambitious spending proposals from the likes of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.

The other problem was monetary policy. In its defense, the Federal Reserve did cut interest rates to zero soon after the Great Recession, in an effort to boost the economy. More recently, it's begun cutting rates again, in recognition of the recovery's tepidness. But in between, the Fed started hiking interest rates far too soon.

economic_policy,National Review,2,http://www.nationalreview.com/article/453468/economic-inequality-crony-capitalism-conservatives,The Conservative Inequality Paradox   Read more at: http://www.nationalreview.com/article/453468/economic-inequality-crony-capitalism-conservatives,2017-11-07,"Brink Lindsey, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Mairead Mcardle, John Mccormack, Carrie Severino, John Fund, Tobias Hoonhout, Rich Lowry, Bill Corsair, Jason Richwine","Conservatives have two intellectual commitments that are increasingly incompatible . They believe that the American economy is clogged up with crony-capitalist corruption that hands out special favors and protections to organized interests . They also hold that economic inequality — in particular , the surging share of total income earned by those at the very top — is morally justified by the rights of property and the tendency of free markets to raise living standards overall .
These two commitments can no longer be squared . If our economy really is riddled with cronyism , then the beneficiaries must have pocketed large amounts of ill-gotten loot . The existing distribution of income and wealth , therefore , does not deserve the deference it would be due if all gains were derived from spontaneous , unregulated market transactions . Call it the conservative inequality paradox : Either conservatives have overstated the amount of crony capitalism , or their dismissal of the concept of inequality as envy is misplaced .
In our new book The Captured Economy , we argue that conservatives are not mistaken about the extent of what we call “ regressive regulation ” — government-created distortions of markets that have the effect of funneling income and wealth up the socioeconomic scale . Such schemes of upward redistribution have proliferated in the past few decades , an era that is often misunderstood as one of unceasing deregulation . And because these reverse–Robin Hood policies work by squelching and misdirecting competition , they exert a powerful downward drag on output and growth as well .
Accordingly , conservatives should redouble their willingness to attack these forms of regulation that — unlike health , safety , and environmental rules , which impose ( sometimes necessary , sometimes excessive ) costs on business — actually boost corporate profits by creating market distortions , including barriers to entry for new competitors . In addition , conservatives need to examine their instinctive defense of business interests and their hostility to redistribution . But that doesn ’ t mean conservatives need to become Bernie bros . There is a distinctly conservative way of addressing inequality in a world of crony capitalism — one that seeks to attack the inequality resulting from anti-market , growth-killing policies .
Progressives may rant about “ neoliberal ” markets run amok , but many conservatives understand clearly that the U.S. economy is far from a textbook model of free competition and voluntary exchange . Senator Mike Lee , for example , has argued that “ cronyist policies come in many shapes and sizes — from subsidies and loan guarantees to tax loopholes and protective regulation — but they all work the same way : The elite leaders of big government , big business , and big special interests collude to help each other climb to the highest rungs of success , and then pull up the ladder behind them. ” And in the 2015 debate over the Export-Import Bank , which primarily subsidizes big-business exports , soon-to-be House speaker Paul Ryan rejected claims that the existence of similar subsidies abroad justified providing them here . “ We should be leading by example , ” he said . “ We should be exporting democratic capitalism , not crony capitalism . ”
If anything , conservatives have been too modest in their assessment of the breadth and scope of crony capitalism . In our book , we focus on four big case studies : financial regulation , patent and copyright law , occupational licensing , and zoning . In all of them , government-caused market distortions have been growing rapidly over recent decades . Between 1980 and 2006 , the financial sector as a percentage of GDP grew by almost 70 percent , fed by regulatory subsidies for securitized mortgages and a string of “ too big to fail ” bailouts . Copyright terms have lengthened from a maximum of 56 years to the current life of the author plus 70 years , while laxer standards for patentability have caused a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of patents awarded annually . This excessive expansion has created a field day for lawyers and inflated profits for Hollywood , big pharma , and Silicon Valley with higher prices and licensing fees . But new innovators faced with traversing this legal minefield are not so fortunate .
In 1970 , only one in ten Americans worked in a job subject to mandatory government licensing ; now it ’ s closer to one in three . Most of that growth has occurred because of a huge expansion in the number of licensed occupations , now over 1,100 and counting . And in the nation ’ s big coastal cities , increasingly restrictive zoning has levied an ever more burdensome tax on new-housing construction — equal to 50 percent of the total price of housing in Manhattan , San Francisco , and San Jose . While boosting real-estate values for lucky legacy homeowners , zoning has imposed a serious drag on national economic output — as much as 10 percent , according to recent estimates . The loss is due to geographic misallocation of the labor force : The country ’ s most productive places can ’ t accommodate all the people who want to live and work there .
But do these market distortions really have anything to do with inequality ? After all , the pursuit of profit through the political system ( what economists call “ rent-seeking ” ) is nothing new : James Madison was writing about the problem of “ faction , ” or special-interest corruption , in The Federalist Papers 230 years ago .

Bush ’ s top economic adviser , displayed this blind spot in a 2013 article in the Journal of Economic Perspectives entitled “ Defending the One Percent. ” “ There is no good reason to believe , ” he wrote , “ that rent-seeking by the rich is more pervasive today than it was in the 1970s , when the income share of the top 1 percent was much lower than it is today . ”
The problems with this analysis are apparent once you scrutinize who exactly occupies the apex of America ’ s economic pyramid . Financial professionals and managers made up 14 percent of the top 1 percent in 2005 , up from 8 percent in 1979 . And while top financial executives earned the same as their peers in other industries in 1980 , they were making a 250 percent premium by 2006 . Doctors accounted for 16 percent of the top 1 percent in 2005 , while lawyers accounted for 8 percent . The representation of doctors and lawyers in the top-earners ’ club has been quite stable for decades ; this means that their incomes have been growing much faster than the incomes of most other Americans , since the threshold for entering the top 1 percent has been moving up rapidly over time as incomes get more unequal . Doctors and lawyers both use occupational licensing to raise their incomes by restricting the supply of practitioners and use the state to inflate demand for their services — in the case of doctors , primarily through their influence over Medicare-reimbursement schedules ; in the case of lawyers , by larding up every law and regulation with dysfunctional but highly litigable complexity .
So nearly 40 percent of earners at the top of the income distribution are finance professionals , doctors , or lawyers — all major beneficiaries of government largesse at our expense . Corporate executives make up another 31 percent of the top 1 percent , and a healthy chunk of them are in industries ( such as movies , recorded music , or pharmaceuticals ) whose profit margins are fattened by government policy .
Even if it were true , as Mankiw contends , that rent-seeking by the rich is no more prevalent now than in the past , incomes at the top are nonetheless swollen with government-created rents . Top-end inequality — the percentage of total income that goes to earners in the top centile — could therefore be reduced significantly if those benefits were eliminated or reduced through policy reforms .
Meanwhile , a review of America ’ s changing political economy makes clear that , while rent-seeking has been a constant , its distributional consequences have clearly changed over time . Beginning with the New Deal , the initial decades of activist government featured a great deal of downward redistribution : The National Labor Relations Act encouraged unions ; the Davis-Bacon Act raised wages on government contracts ; the minimum wage was relatively high ; the federal government set universal-service requirements for telephones and utilities ; municipalities inaugurated rent control and tenant-protection laws . Such policies feature much less prominently today .
Of course , there was plenty of New Deal–era government intervention in behalf of business as well , including high trade barriers and price and entry controls for airlines and trucking . But because the affected industries typically employed large numbers of semi-skilled , unionized workers , a substantial portion of the rents to business ended up shared with workers earning modest incomes . Today , by contrast , the technologically leading industries that occupy the “ commanding heights ” of the economy ( and that thus tend to be the focus of industry-specific regulation ) mostly employ highly skilled workers . Government favoritism for those industries thus mostly benefits the well-off . Accordingly , the evidence strongly supports our contention that rent-seeking has moved upmarket — and , therefore , that a good chunk of the rich ’ s income is indefensible .
Conservative attitudes on inequality have long been shaped by Robert Nozick ’ s famous metaphor of the basketball player Wilt Chamberlain . Nozick argued that Chamberlain ’ s high income was derived from mutually beneficial exchange and was therefore justifiable . Who could say that there was anything unfair about a basketball player trading his skills for the money of fans ? And how could a distribution of income produced by that sort of mutual exchange be unfair ?
But the Wilt Chamberlain metaphor does not apply to an economy characterized by extensive high-end rent-seeking . Even if you believe that market returns are inherently just and therefore worthy of being defended on ethical grounds , how do you justify windfalls that are a function of distorted rules of the game ? The answer is you can ’ t .
In the best of all worlds , conservatives would respond to this state of affairs by attacking rent-derived inequality at its source . Their economic agenda would focus on curtailing subsidies for finance , excessive protection of intellectual property , the licensing of high-end professionals , and overly restrictive land-use regulation . Doing so wouldn ’ t require conservatives to become crusading egalitarians , as these reforms would also unleash economic dynamism , innovation , and growth — familiar conservative priorities .
Too often , conservatives ’ idea of a pro-growth policy agenda starts and ends with tax cuts .
Nevertheless , making regressive regulation a conservative priority would be a distinct change in approach . Too often , conservatives ’ idea of a pro-growth policy agenda starts and ends with tax cuts , despite the overwhelming evidence that moderate increases or decreases in the top rate have little effect on growth . When conservatives do turn their attention to regulation , they usually think about providing “ regulatory relief ” for business by lightening health , safety , environmental , and labor regulations . In our view , though , the regulations with the most pernicious economic effects are the ones that subsidize business by blocking competition or by otherwise distorting markets .
In some cases , conservatives would be able to build on existing strengths when conducting such a campaign . Much of the mischief caused by regressive regulation occurs at the state and local levels : occupational-licensing rules , land-use regulations , and a host of other industry-specific protectionist policies such as those that limit competition for auto dealers , undertakers , and hospitals . A network of free-market think tanks and activist groups is already up and running to push back against this rent-seeking — but these organizations could be doing a lot more . There is no way to fight regulatory capture by the well-off unless other wealthy people make countervailing efforts to even the political playing field , creating the institutional infrastructure needed to ensure that rent-seekers face determined opposition . Conservatives can provide that countervailing power by deepening their investments in state and local policy reform .
In one important respect , conservatives would need to execute a complete change of direction . For decades now , conservatives have favored slashing congressional staff and eliminating congressional support agencies such as the Office of Technology Assessment . These are false economies , as all they do is make Congress ’ s shrunken army of under-resourced patronage staff ever more deeply dependent on industry lobbyists for the information legislators need to govern . To insulate our politics more effectively against insider takeover , legislators need to be able to draw on deep internal expertise . As Lee Drutman and one of us ( Teles ) argued in a 2015 Washington Monthly piece , “ A New Agenda for Political Reform , ” a major upgrade of legislative staff with a larger , better-paid , and more professional cadre of civil servants would arm Congress with the knowledge needed to counter the rent-seeking lobbies that seek to twist rules to their own advantage .
Even if conservatives were to take our advice , a sustained campaign against regressive regulation would not meet with quick , easy victories . What awaits is , in the words of Max Weber , “ the slow boring of hard boards. ” The disproportionate influence of the wealthy over the basic rules of the economy is deeply embedded , and the best we can do is chip away at it , a little at a time .
That leaves a hard question , namely , how conservatives should think about inequality in a fallen , second-best world in which so many of these rents survive . At a minimum , there ’ s a strong case for reconsidering the conservative obsession with reducing top marginal income-tax rates . For too long , conservatives have overhyped the growth effects of tax cuts , as well as the dubious “ starve the beast ” theory according to which members of Congress would respond to tax cuts by restraining government spending . Many conservatives did not look carefully at the evidence behind these dodgy empirical claims because they believed that they held the moral trump card : By cutting taxes , they were returning wealth to its rightful owners . But in the “ captured economy ” we ’ re currently living in , this belief is due for reexamination . Not only is a significant fraction of the rich ’ s income morally tainted by government favoritism , but it is also used to fund yet more rounds of regressive rent-seeking .
One way to begin solving this problem would be to build a veritable bonfire of the deductions that the wealthy use to shield their income from taxation . The exclusion from taxes of employer-paid health insurance , retirement savings through 401 ( k ) s and IRAs , and education savings accounts could either be scrapped or converted into refundable tax credits . We could also consider a financial-transaction tax , which could raise a lot of revenue while also reducing the incentives for excessive trading of assets . Changes such as these would allow us to claw back some of the rents at the top of the economy without increasing the marginal income-tax rates that conservatives are so concerned with .
If conservatives took seriously the presence of ill-gotten gains at the top of the income spectrum , they might also look at immigration policy in a new light . Over the past few decades , the United States has exposed those at the bottom of the economic pile to intense global competition , whether in the form of products from China or workers from Mexico . As Dean Baker has argued , it is high time to expose the wealthy to those same bracing forces of competition by opening up the economy to more high-skilled immigrants , especially in protected professions such as medicine and dentistry .
Conservatives need to face and resolve their inequality paradox . They must double down on their principled advocacy of free , competitive markets — while taking a few giant steps back from the assumption that large incomes reflect large contributions to the general welfare .
It Seems That the GOP Tax Reform is in Trouble","(Photo: Dreamstime)

Yes, the game is rigged for the rich.

Conservatives have two intellectual commitments that are increasingly incompatible. They believe that the American economy is clogged up with crony-capitalist corruption that hands out special favors and protections to organized interests. They also hold that economic inequality — in particular, the surging share of total income earned by those at the very top — is morally justified by the rights of property and the tendency of free markets to raise living standards overall.

These two commitments can no longer be squared. If our economy really is riddled with cronyism, then the beneficiaries must have pocketed large amounts of ill-gotten loot. The existing distribution of income and wealth, therefore, does not deserve the deference it would be due if all gains were derived from spontaneous, unregulated market transactions. Call it the conservative inequality paradox: Either conservatives have overstated the amount of crony capitalism, or their dismissal of the concept of inequality as envy is misplaced.

In our new book The Captured Economy, we argue that conservatives are not mistaken about the extent of what we call “regressive regulation” — government-created distortions of markets that have the effect of funneling income and wealth up the socioeconomic scale. Such schemes of upward redistribution have proliferated in the past few decades, an era that is often misunderstood as one of unceasing deregulation. And because these reverse–Robin Hood policies work by squelching and misdirecting competition, they exert a powerful downward drag on output and growth as well.

Accordingly, conservatives should redouble their willingness to attack these forms of regulation that — unlike health, safety, and environmental rules, which impose (sometimes necessary, sometimes excessive) costs on business — actually boost corporate profits by creating market distortions, including barriers to entry for new competitors. In addition, conservatives need to examine their instinctive defense of business interests and their hostility to redistribution. But that doesn’t mean conservatives need to become Bernie bros. There is a distinctly conservative way of addressing inequality in a world of crony capitalism — one that seeks to attack the inequality resulting from anti-market, growth-killing policies.

Progressives may rant about “neoliberal” markets run amok, but many conservatives understand clearly that the U.S. economy is far from a textbook model of free competition and voluntary exchange. Senator Mike Lee, for example, has argued that “cronyist policies come in many shapes and sizes — from subsidies and loan guarantees to tax loopholes and protective regulation — but they all work the same way: The elite leaders of big government, big business, and big special interests collude to help each other climb to the highest rungs of success, and then pull up the ladder behind them.” And in the 2015 debate over the Export-Import Bank, which primarily subsidizes big-business exports, soon-to-be House speaker Paul Ryan rejected claims that the existence of similar subsidies abroad justified providing them here. “We should be leading by example,” he said. “We should be exporting democratic capitalism, not crony capitalism.”

If anything, conservatives have been too modest in their assessment of the breadth and scope of crony capitalism. In our book, we focus on four big case studies: financial regulation, patent and copyright law, occupational licensing, and zoning. In all of them, government-caused market distortions have been growing rapidly over recent decades. Between 1980 and 2006, the financial sector as a percentage of GDP grew by almost 70 percent, fed by regulatory subsidies for securitized mortgages and a string of “too big to fail” bailouts. Copyright terms have lengthened from a maximum of 56 years to the current life of the author plus 70 years, while laxer standards for patentability have caused a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of patents awarded annually. This excessive expansion has created a field day for lawyers and inflated profits for Hollywood, big pharma, and Silicon Valley with higher prices and licensing fees. But new innovators faced with traversing this legal minefield are not so fortunate.

In 1970, only one in ten Americans worked in a job subject to mandatory government licensing; now it’s closer to one in three. Most of that growth has occurred because of a huge expansion in the number of licensed occupations, now over 1,100 and counting. And in the nation’s big coastal cities, increasingly restrictive zoning has levied an ever more burdensome tax on new-housing construction — equal to 50 percent of the total price of housing in Manhattan, San Francisco, and San Jose. While boosting real-estate values for lucky legacy homeowners, zoning has imposed a serious drag on national economic output — as much as 10 percent, according to recent estimates. The loss is due to geographic misallocation of the labor force: The country’s most productive places can’t accommodate all the people who want to live and work there.

But do these market distortions really have anything to do with inequality? After all, the pursuit of profit through the political system (what economists call “rent-seeking”) is nothing new: James Madison was writing about the problem of “faction,” or special-interest corruption, in The Federalist Papers 230 years ago.

Conservatives as a rule have failed to see a connection between government policies and changes in the income distribution.

The new short-term range will be between 2 % and 2.25 % .
In announcing the move , the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) cited “ implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures . ”
President Donald Trump has often used the Fed and it 's chairman , Jerome Powell , as a boogeyman when bearish economic news hits . On Tuesday , he tweeted , `` Powell let us down . ''
.... As usual , Powell let us down , but at least he is ending quantitative tightening , which shouldn ’ t have started in the first place - no inflation . We are winning anyway , but I am certainly not getting much help from the Federal Reserve ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) July 31 , 2019
Although Tuesday 's cut was built into the market , forecasters were looking for cues to how many rate cuts there would be this year . Powell walked back expectations of further cuts , calling Tuesday 's move a `` midcycle adjustment . ”
Trump and senior economic adviser Larry Kudlow have consistently said they wanted the Fed to cut rates . The Fed has been slowly raising rates over the past few years after the financial crisis . Last year , the Fed hiked rates four times .
Fed watchers dismissed the idea that Powell was caving to political pressure .
`` It 's not political , '' Tim Duy , an economics professor at the University of Oregon , told ███ .
`` In May and June they [ the Fed ] got scared on potential fallout from the trade stuff , and talked themselves into a corner , '' Michael Feroli , chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan , told ███ , referring to an escalation in tensions in the ongoing trade negotiations between the U.S. and China . `` Now if they did n't deliver [ Tuesday ] , it would tough . ''
“ What I said was it 's not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts , '' Powell said . `` We 'll be taking a somewhat more accommodative stance over time . ''
The stock markets fell slightly on the news . The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell on Wednesday 1.2 % to 26,864.27 , while the S & P 500 traded 1 % lower at 2,980.38 .
For most Americans , the rate cut is n't going to make a big impact .
`` It 'll be a small cut , it 's anticipated , so it 's already factored into longer-term interest rates like mortgage rates and auto loans , '' JP Morgan 's Feroli said . `` The change is already reflected . There may be a small change in things like a money market fund or CD deposits . ''
Mortgage rates are already pretty low , Feroli said , noting that a 30-year fixed rate mortgage was at 5.17 % in November 2018 , and last week it was 4.08 % .
`` The impact on fixed mortgage rates will be debatable , '' said Tendayi Kapfidze , LendingTree ’ s chief economist . `` There is often a misconception that changes in the federal funds rate affect mortgage rates , this is not the case . Mortgage rates have already been declining since November and a Fed funds cut will likely have no impact . ''
However , there may be some movement in variable-rate products like adjustable-rate mortgages , or ARMs , and home-equity lines of credit , which are based on short-term rates .

''","The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point, the first cut since the 2008 financial crisis. The new short-term range will be between 2% and 2.25%.

In announcing the move, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) cited “implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures.”

President Donald Trump has often used the Fed and it's chairman, Jerome Powell, as a boogeyman when bearish economic news hits. On Tuesday, he tweeted, ""Powell let us down.""

....As usual, Powell let us down, but at least he is ending quantitative tightening, which shouldn’t have started in the first place - no inflation. We are winning anyway, but I am certainly not getting much help from the Federal Reserve! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 31, 2019

Although Tuesday's cut was built into the market, forecasters were looking for cues to how many rate cuts there would be this year. Powell walked back expectations of further cuts, calling Tuesday's move a ""midcycle adjustment.”

Trump and senior economic adviser Larry Kudlow have consistently said they wanted the Fed to cut rates. The Fed has been slowly raising rates over the past few years after the financial crisis. Last year, the Fed hiked rates four times.

Fed watchers dismissed the idea that Powell was caving to political pressure.

""It's not political,"" Tim Duy, an economics professor at the University of Oregon, told ABC News.

""In May and June they [the Fed] got scared on potential fallout from the trade stuff, and talked themselves into a corner,"" Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan, told ABC News, referring to an escalation in tensions in the ongoing trade negotiations between the U.S. and China. ""Now if they didn't deliver [Tuesday], it would tough.""

“What I said was it's not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts,"" Powell said. ""We'll be taking a somewhat more accommodative stance over time.""

The stock markets fell slightly on the news. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell on Wednesday 1.2% to 26,864.27, while the S&P 500 traded 1% lower at 2,980.38.

For most Americans, the rate cut isn't going to make a big impact.

""It'll be a small cut, it's anticipated, so it's already factored into longer-term interest rates like mortgage rates and auto loans,"" JP Morgan's Feroli said. ""The change is already reflected. There may be a small change in things like a money market fund or CD deposits.""

Mortgage rates are already pretty low, Feroli said, noting that a 30-year fixed rate mortgage was at 5.17% in November 2018, and last week it was 4.08%.

""The impact on fixed mortgage rates will be debatable,"" said Tendayi Kapfidze, LendingTree’s chief economist. ""There is often a misconception that changes in the federal funds rate affect mortgage rates, this is not the case. Mortgage rates have already been declining since November and a Fed funds cut will likely have no impact.""

However, there may be some movement in variable-rate products like adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs, and home-equity lines of credit, which are based on short-term rates.

It's also good news for holders of credit card debt.

""Credit card interest rates track the bank prime rate, defined as 3% above the Fed funds target rate,"" Kapfidze said. ""Many credit card contracts do automatically adjust rates downwards, and some lenders may elect to keep rates unchanged to increase profits. Cardholders should call and ask for lower rates.""

Car loans also won't likely be impacted.

""Interest rates have been squeezing car shopper wallets all year, so a Fed rate cut is certainly a move in a more favorable direction,"" Jeremy Acevedo, senior manager of insights at auto research firm Edmunds, told ABC News. ""However, this is a pretty modest cut, and the reality is that shoppers returning to the market for the first time after a few years are still going to be spending thousands more to finance their new car purchases thanks to rising vehicle costs and elevated interest rates.""

""We don't expect to see more rate cuts moving forward,"" Acevedo added, ""so shoppers can't count on this to open the floodgates for the zero percent finance deals that we saw a few years ago.""

For years Americans have assumed that our hard-charging capitalism is better than the soft-hearted version found in Canada and Europe.

economic_policy,Townhall,2,http://townhall.com/columnists/donaldlambro/2015/07/24/hillary-clintons-capital-gains-tax-doublecross-n2029500,Hillary Clinton’s Capital Gains Tax Double-Cross,2015-07-24,"Donald Lambro, Beth Baumann, Bronson Stocking, Matt Vespa","WASHINGTON - Hillary Clinton is expected to unveil an overhaul of the capital gains tax rate this week that she says will strengthen the economy and create more jobs .
The only trouble is that her plan calls for raising the tax rate on investors , the ones who provide the lion 's share of investment capital needed for business expansion which fosters stronger economic growth and creates more jobs .
There have been few details coming out of the former Secretary of State 's presidential campaign which has been very secretive about Clinton 's economic policies .
But some reports in the news media suggest that her plan has slower growth and higher taxes written all over it .
Here 's what the Club for Growth said this week under the pointed title `` Hillary 's Capital Gains Tax Plan Attacks Investors . ''
`` You could say that Hillary 's plan follows typical liberal logic by picking winners and losers , only this time she 's targeting investors , '' said Club for Growth President David McIntosh .
`` The truth is her plan just makes more losers by crushing investors with higher taxes . Some reports say her top rate could be close to 40 percent . The fact is Hillary wants to punish success in order to grow government , and that means the biggest loser will be our economy , '' he said .
The Clinton campaign says her plan will raise capital gains tax rates on certain short-term investments held at least a year ( now set at 23.8 percent ) to at least 28 percent , as President Obama has already proposed -- and possibly higher .
The Wall Street Journal reported that Clinton 's campaign advisers have not ruled out raising it to 39.6 percent for those in the highest income tax bracket .
Clinton campaign officials have described the plan as an effort to encourage long-term economic growth through a sliding tax rate scale – taxing short-term investments at higher rates and longer-term investments as lower rates .
But the fact of the matter is that this is a smoke-and-mirrors plan to raise taxes on wealthier investors and put the government further in charge of economic decision-making in our capital markets .
Moreover , Clinton 's capital gains tax proposal appears to have all the earmarks of playing the game of campaign politics – not fostering economic growth .
With Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders , a self-described socialist , drawing increasing support from the Democratic Party 's liberal base , Clinton has toughened her rhetoric on Wall Street , promising increased regulatory oversight , and now higher taxes , too .
Her tax plan is a full retreat from the position she took in her bid for the presidency in 2008 when she promised not to raise the capital gains tax rate above 20 percent .
`` I would n't raise it above 20 percent , if I raised it at all , '' she said in her campaign debate with Barack Obama .
Back then , she was following the advice of her husband , President Clinton , who , in his second term , signed a GOP bill slashing the top capital gains tax rate from 28 percent to 20 percent .
That 's when the economy took off as investors quickly sold off underperforming stocks and poured their capital into an explosion of new start-up , high tech firms .
The surge in the capital gains tax revenue slashed the government 's budget deficit , and led to a wave of new job creation from an expanding economy that pounded the unemployment rate down to 4 percent .
Clinton says her proposal to lower the capital gains tax rate on long-held investments , and a higher rate on short-term gains , will lift our economy . But that 's not how a free , dynamic economy works .
No one predicted the dot-com boom , or the speed with which new high tech companies appeared and sent stocks soaring .
A heavy-handed system where investment decisions are governed by the federal government 's tax calendar , and not by the free market can wreak havoc with our economy – one in which investors are punished by a higher tax rate if they sell their assets at the wrong time .
`` Today 's system…features a preferential tax rate on assets held more than a year . But it makes no distinction beyond that . Gains on stocks held from 366 days are taxed at the same rate as those held 36 years , '' writes Richard Rubin of the Bloomberg.com news service .

Want to strengthen the economy and create more jobs ? Abolish the capital gains tax which is double taxation at its worst . Or at the very least , as Bill Clinton showed us , slash it to the bone .","WASHINGTON - Hillary Clinton is expected to unveil an overhaul of the capital gains tax rate this week that she says will strengthen the economy and create more jobs.

The only trouble is that her plan calls for raising the tax rate on investors, the ones who provide the lion's share of investment capital needed for business expansion which fosters stronger economic growth and creates more jobs.

There have been few details coming out of the former Secretary of State's presidential campaign which has been very secretive about Clinton's economic policies.

But some reports in the news media suggest that her plan has slower growth and higher taxes written all over it.

Here's what the Club for Growth said this week under the pointed title ""Hillary's Capital Gains Tax Plan Attacks Investors.""

""You could say that Hillary's plan follows typical liberal logic by picking winners and losers, only this time she's targeting investors,"" said Club for Growth President David McIntosh.

""The truth is her plan just makes more losers by crushing investors with higher taxes. Some reports say her top rate could be close to 40 percent. The fact is Hillary wants to punish success in order to grow government, and that means the biggest loser will be our economy,"" he said.

The Clinton campaign says her plan will raise capital gains tax rates on certain short-term investments held at least a year (now set at 23.8 percent) to at least 28 percent, as President Obama has already proposed -- and possibly higher.

The Wall Street Journal reported that Clinton's campaign advisers have not ruled out raising it to 39.6 percent for those in the highest income tax bracket.

Clinton campaign officials have described the plan as an effort to encourage long-term economic growth through a sliding tax rate scale – taxing short-term investments at higher rates and longer-term investments as lower rates.

But the fact of the matter is that this is a smoke-and-mirrors plan to raise taxes on wealthier investors and put the government further in charge of economic decision-making in our capital markets.

Moreover, Clinton's capital gains tax proposal appears to have all the earmarks of playing the game of campaign politics – not fostering economic growth.

With Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described socialist, drawing increasing support from the Democratic Party's liberal base, Clinton has toughened her rhetoric on Wall Street, promising increased regulatory oversight, and now higher taxes, too.

Her tax plan is a full retreat from the position she took in her bid for the presidency in 2008 when she promised not to raise the capital gains tax rate above 20 percent.

""I wouldn't raise it above 20 percent, if I raised it at all,"" she said in her campaign debate with Barack Obama.

Back then, she was following the advice of her husband, President Clinton, who, in his second term, signed a GOP bill slashing the top capital gains tax rate from 28 percent to 20 percent.

That's when the economy took off as investors quickly sold off underperforming stocks and poured their capital into an explosion of new start-up, high tech firms.

The surge in the capital gains tax revenue slashed the government's budget deficit, and led to a wave of new job creation from an expanding economy that pounded the unemployment rate down to 4 percent.

Clinton says her proposal to lower the capital gains tax rate on long-held investments, and a higher rate on short-term gains, will lift our economy. But that's not how a free, dynamic economy works.

No one predicted the dot-com boom, or the speed with which new high tech companies appeared and sent stocks soaring.

A heavy-handed system where investment decisions are governed by the federal government's tax calendar, and not by the free market can wreak havoc with our economy – one in which investors are punished by a higher tax rate if they sell their assets at the wrong time.

""Today's system…features a preferential tax rate on assets held more than a year. But it makes no distinction beyond that. Gains on stocks held from 366 days are taxed at the same rate as those held 36 years,"" writes Richard Rubin of the Bloomberg.com news service.

And that in part may be why her plan is coming under fire from the private equity industry.

""Taxing long-term carried interest as anything other than a long-term capital gain would deprive private equity, venture capital, real estate, and many other businesses of the same treatment available to other kinds of businesses that sell a long-term capital asset for a profit,"" says Steve Judge, president of the Private Equity Growth Capital Council.

And, he adds, if she hopes to win the presidency ""she's going to have to do it by defending the notion that higher taxes on the rich aren't going to affect the behavior of the so-called job creators in a material way.""

Good luck.

“American workers have paid taxes their whole life. They shouldn’t be taxed again when they die,” he said Monday.

Clinton will explain how this applies only to people in and around Trump’s tax bracket.

If Trump is truly worth “in excess of $10bn” as he has claimed, she will say, then he would pay 40% for the estate tax, or approximately $3.996bn when he passes his estate along to his heirs.

Clinton will also make the case that it’s “no coincidence” Trump is pushing tax reforms that largely benefit his own family. Clinton has said she will push for a tax system that ensures the wealthiest Americans and large corporations pay higher rates than middle-class households.

economic_policy,Guest Writer - Right,2,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/08/how-government-creates-wealth-inequality/,How the Government Creates Wealth Inequality,2019-08-19,"Chris Edwards, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Mairead Mcardle, John Mccormack, Carrie Severino, John Fund, Tobias Hoonhout, Rich Lowry, Bill Corsair, Andrew C. Mccarthy","Sen. Bernie Sanders speaks in Des Moines , Iowa , August 10 , 2019 . ( Scott Morgan/Reuters )
Politicians complain loudly about this problem , but their own policies are generating it .
There are economic storm clouds on the horizon , but for now wages are rising , jobs are plentiful , and poverty is falling . Democrats running for president need an economic line of attack , so the solution has been to focus on wealth inequality . Senator Bernie Sanders claims that there has been a “ massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top one percent. ” Senator Elizabeth Warren lambastes America ’ s “ extreme concentration of wealth. ” Even the establishment Joe Biden laments , “ This wealth gap that exists in the United States of America is so profound now . ”
Wealth inequality has risen in recent years , but by far less than the Democrats and many media articles imply . The scarier claims about inequality usually stem from the flawed data created by French economist Thomas Piketty and his colleagues . More careful studies by other economists and the Federal Reserve Board reveal surprisingly modest changes in wealth inequality given the huge revolutions in globalization and technology that have occurred .
Are increases in wealth inequality the awful thing that Democrats claim ? It depends on what causes them . Much of the recent modest rise in wealth inequality stems from innovations in our economy that are pulling everyone up . Brian Acton and Jan Koum , for example , built huge multibillion dollar fortunes by creating WhatsApp , which provides free phone service for 1.5 billion users globally .
Acton and Koum ’ s success may have increased the wealth owned by the top 1 percent , but their product has created massive consumer value as well . Most of the wealthiest Americans are entrepreneurs who have fueled economic growth , which is clear in examining the Forbes 400 list . Wealth created this way is not the zero-sum struggle that Democrats imagine it is .
That is the good news . The bad news is that the government itself generates wealth inequality in at least two ways that make us worse off . First , governments give subsidies , regulatory preferences , and other crony-capitalist benefits to wealthy insiders . In the recent Fat Leonard scandal , for example , Leonard Francis gained hundreds of millions of dollars of government contracts by cozying up to Navy officers and providing them with gifts , prostitutes , and other favors to get them to do his bidding .
The other way that the government fuels wealth inequality is a deeper scandal . The expansion of social programs over the decades has undermined incentives for lower- and middle-income families to save while reducing their ability to save because of higher taxes . Government programs have displaced or “ crowded out ” wealth-building by all American families but the richest .
Politicians complain loudly about wealth inequality , but their own policies are generating it . This issue receives too little policy attention , but it is profoundly important and reveals the hypocrisy of the political left .
Many Americans have saved little for retirement because Social Security discourages them doing so , as does the heavy 12.4 percent wage tax that funds the program . Economist Martin Feldstein found that every dollar increase in Social Security benefits reduces private savings by about 50 cents .
Social Security accounts for a larger share of retirement income for the non-rich than for the rich , so this crowd-out effect increases wealth inequality . In a simulation model , Jagadeesh Gokhale and Laurence Kotlikoff estimated that Social Security raises the share of overall wealth held by the top 1 percent of wealth holders by about 80 percent . This occurs because the program leaves the non-rich with “ proportionately less to save , less reason to save , and a larger share of their old-age resources in a nonbequeathable form . ”
A study by Baris Kaymak and Markus Poschke built a model of the U.S. economy to estimate the causes of rising wealth inequality . They found that most of the rise in the top 1 percent share of wealth in recent decades was caused by technological changes and wage dispersion , but the expansion of Social Security and Medicare caused about one-quarter of the increase . They concluded that the “ redistributive nature of transfer payments was instrumental in curbing wealth accumulation for income groups outside the top 10 % and , consequently , amplified wealth concentration in the U.S . ”
More government benefits result in less private wealth , especially for the non-rich . It is not just Social Security and Medicare that displaces private saving , but also unemployment insurance , welfare , and other social spending .

Bernie Sanders speaks in Des Moines, Iowa, August 10, 2019. (Scott Morgan/Reuters)

Politicians complain loudly about this problem, but their own policies are generating it.

There are economic storm clouds on the horizon, but for now wages are rising, jobs are plentiful, and poverty is falling. Democrats running for president need an economic line of attack, so the solution has been to focus on wealth inequality. Senator Bernie Sanders claims that there has been a “massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top one percent.” Senator Elizabeth Warren lambastes America’s “extreme concentration of wealth.” Even the establishment Joe Biden laments, “This wealth gap that exists in the United States of America is so profound now.”

Wealth inequality has risen in recent years, but by far less than the Democrats and many media articles imply. The scarier claims about inequality usually stem from the flawed data created by French economist Thomas Piketty and his colleagues. More careful studies by other economists and the Federal Reserve Board reveal surprisingly modest changes in wealth inequality given the huge revolutions in globalization and technology that have occurred.

Are increases in wealth inequality the awful thing that Democrats claim? It depends on what causes them. Much of the recent modest rise in wealth inequality stems from innovations in our economy that are pulling everyone up. Brian Acton and Jan Koum, for example, built huge multibillion dollar fortunes by creating WhatsApp, which provides free phone service for 1.5 billion users globally.

Acton and Koum’s success may have increased the wealth owned by the top 1 percent, but their product has created massive consumer value as well. Most of the wealthiest Americans are entrepreneurs who have fueled economic growth, which is clear in examining the Forbes 400 list. Wealth created this way is not the zero-sum struggle that Democrats imagine it is.

That is the good news. The bad news is that the government itself generates wealth inequality in at least two ways that make us worse off. First, governments give subsidies, regulatory preferences, and other crony-capitalist benefits to wealthy insiders. In the recent Fat Leonard scandal, for example, Leonard Francis gained hundreds of millions of dollars of government contracts by cozying up to Navy officers and providing them with gifts, prostitutes, and other favors to get them to do his bidding.

The other way that the government fuels wealth inequality is a deeper scandal. The expansion of social programs over the decades has undermined incentives for lower- and middle-income families to save while reducing their ability to save because of higher taxes. Government programs have displaced or “crowded out” wealth-building by all American families but the richest.

Politicians complain loudly about wealth inequality, but their own policies are generating it. This issue receives too little policy attention, but it is profoundly important and reveals the hypocrisy of the political left.

Many Americans have saved little for retirement because Social Security discourages them doing so, as does the heavy 12.4 percent wage tax that funds the program. Economist Martin Feldstein found that every dollar increase in Social Security benefits reduces private savings by about 50 cents.

Social Security accounts for a larger share of retirement income for the non-rich than for the rich, so this crowd-out effect increases wealth inequality. In a simulation model, Jagadeesh Gokhale and Laurence Kotlikoff estimated that Social Security raises the share of overall wealth held by the top 1 percent of wealth holders by about 80 percent. This occurs because the program leaves the non-rich with “proportionately less to save, less reason to save, and a larger share of their old-age resources in a nonbequeathable form.”

A study by Baris Kaymak and Markus Poschke built a model of the U.S. economy to estimate the causes of rising wealth inequality. They found that most of the rise in the top 1 percent share of wealth in recent decades was caused by technological changes and wage dispersion, but the expansion of Social Security and Medicare caused about one-quarter of the increase. They concluded that the “redistributive nature of transfer payments was instrumental in curbing wealth accumulation for income groups outside the top 10% and, consequently, amplified wealth concentration in the U.S.”

More government benefits result in less private wealth, especially for the non-rich. It is not just Social Security and Medicare that displaces private saving, but also unemployment insurance, welfare, and other social spending. Some social programs have “asset tests” that deliberately discourage saving.

Total federal and state social spending as a share of gross domestic product soared from 6.8 percent in 1970 to 14.3 percent in 2018. That increase in handouts occurred over the same period that wealth inequality appears to have increased. Generations of Americans have grown up assuming that the government will take care of them when they are sick, unemployed, and retired, so they put too little money aside for future expenses.

Cross-country studies support these conclusions. A 2015 study by Pirmin Fessler and Martin Schurz examined European data and found that “inequality of wealth is higher in countries with a relatively more developed welfare state . . . given an increase of welfare state expenditure, wealth inequality measured by standard relative inequality measures, such as the Gini coefficient, will increase.”

That is why it is absurd for politicians such as Sanders and Warren to decry wealth inequality and then turn around and demand European-style expansions in our social programs. The bigger our welfare state, the more wealth inequality we will have.

The solution is to transition to savings-based social programs. Numerous countries have Social Security systems based on private savings accounts. Chile has unemployment-insurance savings accounts. Martin Feldstein proposed a savings-based approach to Medicare. The assets in such savings accounts would be inheritable, unlike the benefits from current U.S. social programs.

A proposal to study whether the state should adopt its own currency is gaining traction in the state legislature from a number of lawmakers as well as conservative economists . The state House voted 65-32 earlier this week to approve the measure , and it will now go to the Senate .
While it ’ s unlikely that Virginia will be printing its own money any time soon , the move sheds light on the growing distrust surrounding the nation ’ s central bank . Four other states are considering similar proposals . In 2011 , Utah passed a law that recognizes gold and silver coins issued by the federal government as tender and requires a study on adopting other forms of legal currency .
Virginia Republican Del . Robert Marshall told FoxNews.com Tuesday that his bill calls for creation of a 10-member commission that would determine the “ need , means and schedule for establishing a metallic-based monetary unit. ” Essentially , he wants to spend $ 20,000 on a study that could call for the state to return to a gold standard .
The gold standard is a system under which a country ties the value of its currency to gold , setting a fixed price at which gold can be bought or sold by the government .
“ We ’ re not going to be printing money with Dave Matthews or Jeff Davis on the front of it , ” Marshall said , referring to two famous Virginians .

A proposal to study whether the state should adopt its own currency is gaining traction in the state legislature from a number of lawmakers as well as conservative economists. The state House voted 65-32 earlier this week to approve the measure, and it will now go to the Senate.

While it’s unlikely that Virginia will be printing its own money any time soon, the move sheds light on the growing distrust surrounding the nation’s central bank. Four other states are considering similar proposals. In 2011, Utah passed a law that recognizes gold and silver coins issued by the federal government as tender and requires a study on adopting other forms of legal currency.

Virginia Republican Del. Robert Marshall told FoxNews.com Tuesday that his bill calls for creation of a 10-member commission that would determine the “need, means and schedule for establishing a metallic-based monetary unit.” Essentially, he wants to spend $20,000 on a study that could call for the state to return to a gold standard.

The gold standard is a system under which a country ties the value of its currency to gold, setting a fixed price at which gold can be bought or sold by the government.

“We’re not going to be printing money with Dave Matthews or Jeff Davis on the front of it,” Marshall said, referring to two famous Virginians.

Marshall said he wants to inject competition into the national economy and force the federal government to change its current policy – one he believes will lead to hyperinflation and instability. He also thinks Virginia should be armed with an alternative currency in case it comes under a cyber attack. Many of Marshall’s arguments are similar to ones made by the Tea Party.

“This is like planning for the Titanic,” he said.

Not everyone agrees.

In introductory economics courses , students are typically taught that setting price floors — on milk , oil , or labor — causes supply to exceed demand . In the case of labor , what that means is that if there ’ s a minimum wage , employers ’ demand for workers falls ( because they cost more ) , and the supply of workers increases ( because they ’ re promised more money ) — meaning there ’ s unemployment , with all the costs and suffering that entails .
For a long time , that ’ s how the theory went . But in 1993 , economists Alan Krueger and David Card brought hard data to bear on the question and published a groundbreaking paper that forced economists to reconsider the issue .
They surveyed more than 400 fast-food restaurants in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania to see if employment growth was slower in New Jersey following an increase in the minimum wage . They found no evidence that it was .
Card and Krueger expanded their results into a well-regarded book , Myth and Measurement ( 1995 ) , and the empirical literature on the question exploded after that .
In the ensuing quarter-century , economic research has put to rest what had been a fundamental assumption — that low minimum wages always cause major disemployment in the short run . Instead , researchers have discovered a gamut of results . Some have found real employment effects ( if short of seriously disruptive effects as previously assumed ) , but a new evidence review finds that most studies have found small or no effects .
The comprehensive review of the evidence on minimum wages , conducted by Arindrajit Dube for the British government , seeks to summarize the current evidence base , a quarter-century after Card and Krueger ’ s pioneering work . Dube , a professor of economics at UMass Amherst , is one of the leading experts on the effects of minimum wage laws within economics , and his research has typically found small employment effects , if any , from the policy .
In his new paper , Dube finds that the average effect on employment across the studies he reviews is very close to zero — that is , in most of the high-quality studies he reviews , a few outliers aside , the number of jobs cost by minimum wage laws is negligible . They raise wages without much downside .
The review also builds on a paper in the Quarterly Journal of Economics by Dube , Doruk Cengiz , Attila Lindner , and Ben Zipperer that examined 138 different changes in the minimum wage from 1979 to 2016 . The paper found that on average , “ overall number of low-wage jobs remained essentially unchanged over the five years following the increase. ” Moreover , the paper identifies a macroeconomic quirk in the late 1980s/early 1990s that , once accounted for , helps resolve some disagreement in the literature .
The paper certainly doesn ’ t put to rest the debate over minimum wage studies . Skeptics remain . There is still disagreement about the scale of employment effects , and about what new minimum wage laws setting minimums as high as $ 15 an hour could do .
We also don ’ t know everything about why minimums don ’ t seem to cause a huge amount of job loss . Firms seem to pass on some of the costs to consumers , and in some cases have “ monopsony ” power : if employees have only a handful of potential employers to choose from , those employers can get away with paying workers less , because they have fewer exit options .
In some ways , this is the most vital research field at the moment . “ It ’ s much more interesting to think of the minimum wage as a flashlight into the labor market than to always wind up debating the employment effect , ” Suresh Naidu at Columbia says .
But we do know a fair bit more than we did in 1993 , and the evidence we have now suggests that in many cases minimum wages are a net good for workers — even if a few workers lose jobs , those costs are significantly outstripped by increased wages for workers who keep their jobs . Whether that will remain true with minimums of $ 15 or more , especially in rural areas , remains to be seen .
Dube ’ s new review was conducted at the request of a surprising source : the Conservative government of the United Kingdom . The Conservative cabinet has proposed gradually raising the country ’ s minimum wage to £10.50 an hour ( about $ 15 ) by 2024 , whereas Labour wants to raise it to £10 an hour ( $ 14.28 ) immediately . In sharp contrast to the US , the debate there is about the speed and level of minimum wage increases , rather than on whether or not they occur at all .
Dube thus focuses heavily on the UK ’ s own experience launching a national minimum wage in 1998 , exactly 60 years after the US set a national minimum . But he also reviews the evidence in the US , including more recent studies in cities like Seattle , Chicago , Washington DC , Oakland , San Francisco , and San Jose , as well as studies examining minimum wage increases in Hungary and Germany . Dube collects 55 estimates of the minimum wage ’ s impact on employment across the world , including 36 estimates from the US , and two estimates for the US and UK that he produced for the report .
Throughout he seeks to estimate the “ own-wage elasticity ” ( OWE ) in each context : the increase in wages for a given group caused by an increase in the minimum wage , divided by the change in that group ’ s probability of employment caused by the minimum wage increase . An OWE of negative 1 , for instance , is a “ break-even ” number : If wages for , say , fast food workers rise 10 percent following a minimum wage increase , then an OWE of -1 suggests odds of employment would fall 10 percent in turn .
The median study looking at a broad group of low-wage workers estimates an “ elasticity ” of -0.04 ; that is , a 25-percent increase in average wages for a given group due to a minimum wage increase should lead to a 1 percent decline in employment for that group . That ’ s a really small effect , and one that suggests the benefits of a modest minimum wage hike should swamp the costs .
Studies looking at smaller groups of workers more likely to be bound by a minimum wage , like teenagers , find bigger effects : if you include studies looking at any size of group , the average OWE is -0.17 . But that still implies that disemployment effects are swamped by higher wages .
That evidence base is enough for many labor economists , like Harvard ’ s Larry Katz , to conclude that we know reasonably well that modest minimum wage increases do more good than harm . “ I ’ ve had many students on both sides of these debates , ” Katz says . “ When [ minimum wages ] affect non-traded goods sectors , which is largely true in the US , they clearly increase the wages for low-wage workers impacted . They seem to have very modest impacts on employment . ”
Dube ’ s review is the latest salvo in a contentious debate that has evolved in interesting directions . When modern minimum wage research began in the 1990s , there were two dominant approaches .
One approach , pioneered by Card and Krueger , compared border counties in neighboring states , one of which increased the minimum wage and one of which didn ’ t . The other , used by UC Irvine ’ s David Neumark and the Fed Board of Governors ’ William Wascher , tracked employment in full states over time , to see if employment fell in the wake of a minimum wage increase . The two methodologies tended to get different results : Card and Krueger , of course , found no employment effects , while Neumark and Wascher tended to find substantial job loss following minimum wage increases .
Each approach , however , had drawbacks . Card and Krueger ’ s approach focused on one specific case — New Jersey ’ s minimum wage hikes — that might not generalize to the country as a whole . The minimum wage increase also might have forced Pennsylvania employers to raise their wages in response , which could make Pennsylvania a bad control group : it ’ s not unaffected by the minimum wage increase in New Jersey , it ’ s also affected .
The Neumark/Wascher approach , by contrast , relied on comparisons between states that might otherwise be very different . There are a million reasons why , say , employment might have grown more slowly in California following a minimum wage increase than in Arizona . Neumark and Wascher generally used few “ control ” variables in an effort to keep the comparison clean and avoid “ over-controlling ” and accidentally ignoring effects that are due to the minimum wage , but critics argued this could lead them to erroneously blame the minimum wage for job losses that were totally unrelated .
The varying approaches could lead to different evidence reviews drawing quite different conclusions . A 2007 paper by Neumark and Wascher concluded that the “ most credible ” studies found that the minimum wage costs a substantial number of jobs . Meanwhile , a paper by Dale Belman and Paul Wolfson first published in 2015 found that most credible research estimates minimal effect on jobs .
One thing that happened between 2007 and 2015 is that economists devised better methods . Researchers led by Dube have pioneered a new method of border-county comparisons that extends nationally : starting in a 2010 paper , Dube , T. William Lester , and Michael Reich compared “ all contiguous county-pairs in the United States that are located on opposite sides of a state border , ” a vast expansion of the general Card-Krueger approach . That creates a much larger sample and enables a nationwide study , rather than one limited to just , say , New Jersey .
That study found no noticeable effect on employment . It also tested for spillovers — an increased minimum wage in one state raising wages in the state next door — and found they were negligible .
More recently in their 2019 Quarterly Journal of Economics paper , Dube , Cengiz , Lindner , and Zipperer find that much of the disagreement between the Card/Krueger and Neumark/Wascher approaches is attributable to a quirk in the late 1980s and early 1990s . During that period , blue states experienced an economic downturn relative to red states that predated the biggest blue state minimum wage increases ; that made it look like minimum wages were lowering employment growth , when what was really happening was that blue states both had lower employment growth and separately increased their minimum wages .
“ In our QJE paper we showed that the specifications under argument ( lot of controls , little controls ) actually all suggest little job loss in the post 1995 period ; and that this appears to be driven by the quirky 80s boom/bust , ” Dube told me . “ None of us knew this until recently . This is actually progress . ”
But new research arguing for substantial disemployment effects has emerged too . Jonathan Meer of Texas A & M and Jeremy West of UC Santa Cruz in a 2016 paper found that while short-run employment isn ’ t affected by increases in the minimum wage , states that raised their minimums saw slower job growth in subsequent years .
This makes some intuitive sense : you might expect a coffee shop that sees its wage minimum rise from $ 9 to $ 12 , say , to not actively lay off any employees , but to hire fewer people in the future . Meer and West argued that focusing on employment levels , rather than rates , produced much of the disagreement in the literature up to that point , because it made estimates sensitive to what trends in employment existed before the minimum wage increase .
This led to a fierce back and forth between Meer and West and Dube . Dube in a 2013 study argued that the job growth slowdown in Meer and West showed up disproportionately in manufacturing , where wages are too high to be affected by the minimum wage , suggesting that their model picked up some noise that wasn ’ t related to the minimum wage at all — and added that using his methodology to look at employment growth , you didn ’ t find any effects at all .
Meer and West countered that when you add appropriate controls , the industries seeing slower job growth aren ’ t weird or surprising ; a recent paper by Doruk Cengiz using machine learning to decompose the employment effects that Meer and West discuss suggests they ’ re mostly among higher-wage individuals , which bolsters Dube ’ s critique .
Another skeptic , UC San Diego ’ s Jeffrey Clemens , had one paper included in Dube ’ s review . Written with Michael Wither , it estimated significant job losses due to the 2007 increase in the federal minimum wage amidst the Great Recession .
Clemens argues that other important studies did not get sufficient emphasis in Dube ’ s review . He names , for instance , a paper by MIT ’ s John Horton where an online labor market — it ’ s not Amazon ’ s Mechanical Turk , but that ’ s a good comparison — randomly imposed minimum wages for some firms posting jobs , and not others . The firms with minimums reduced hiring and hours worked , pivoting away from low-productivity workers to high-productivity ones . That ’ s a true experiment , and one that suggests some disemployment effects .
Clemens also points to a Danish study examining youth employment . Denmark ’ s union-negotiated minimum wages kick in at age 18 , and , sure enough , the study finds that employment drops by a third when 17-year-olds turn 18 , suggesting large-scale unemployment due to a minimum wage .
Dube actually did include this one in his study , but notes it ’ s a very different policy from a broad-based minimum wage . “ Employers can costlessly substitute higher paid , slightly older workers for identical but lower-paid , slightly younger ones , ” in Denmark , he says . “ There is very clear reason why you ’ d expect more job loss in this context , but there is no equivalent for this for , say , a broad based minimum wage policy . ”
The online and Denmark studies use extremely credible designs that are arguably better than most of the cross-border or cross-state comparisons that dominate minimum wage research . But they lack “ external validity ” : it ’ s not clear that an online task marketplace is a good model for the US labor market , to say the least , and the Denmark example has the problems that Dube notes .
Another study that Dube includes in his review deserves special comment .
Seattle , Washington was one of the first major cities to vote to gradually increase its minimum wage to $ 15 an hour , and the University of Washington has been conducting a large-scale ongoing study to see what effect that hike has . The most recent report from the study suggests that increasing the minimum to $ 13 an hour reduced work hours , but raised wages by enough that low-income workers as a whole were better off on average . That doesn ’ t mean that all low-income workers were better off , though , and the study suggests that many had to find work outside Seattle to supplement their incomes .
An earlier study from the project found much larger negative effects on employment . That study came under intense criticism for data limitations ( it doesn ’ t include employers with locations both in Seattle and outside , because the part of Washington outside of Seattle serves as the control group ) . The effects it estimated were extremely large relative to other studies in the literature , and many labor economists like Harvard ’ s Lawrence Katz don ’ t find the research reliable . “ The Seattle study is completely uninformative because there ’ s no comparison group for Seattle , ” Katz says . “ It ’ s the fastest growing labor market we ’ ve basically ever seen . ”
Reliable or not , the Seattle studies have gotten outsized attention because they represent the first wave of studies on the new mega-increases in the minimum wage following the Fight for $ 15 movement . California , DC , Illinois , Maryland , Massachusetts , New Jersey , and New York are all gradually increasing their minimums to $ 15 an hour ; even more rural/lower-wage states like Arkansas , Maine , and Missouri are gradually increasing their minimums to $ 11 or $ 12 .
Dube notes in his review that the best evidence we have suggests minimal job impacts on minimum wages of up to 60 percent of the median wage . The median hourly wage in El Centro , California is about $ 15.50 , meaning the $ 13 an hour minimum ( effective January 1 of next year ) is over 80 percent of the median wage there . The effects there might be very different .
Dube addresses this concern in his review , noting that a recent study looking at counties that have already raised their minimum wages to over 80 percent of the median wage still found minimal effects .
But there ’ s sure to be additional research as the new wages are phased in , and everyone in the debate , from Dube to Meer , thinks there ’ s some point where the disemployment effects become too large . What we don ’ t know is if any wage increases passed to this point will reach that level .
“ Most of the $ 15 minimum wage proposals are phased in over multiple years and are probably like $ 11/ $ 12 today , ” Katz notes . “ If you told me we ’ re going to $ 15 tomorrow I would worry about low-wage states . If you told me over five , six , seven years , I ’ m not super-worried . ”
Clemens and AEI ’ s Michael Strain are doing precommitted studies on the minimum wage — where they agree to use a certain kind of analysis ahead of time — to ensure they don ’ t change analytical method to get a specific result later . So far they ’ ve found mixed results , with bigger job losses from bigger increases and little effect from smaller increases in the minimum wage . And they ’ re hardly the only ones who will be looking .
It ’ s easy to become pessimistic about the prospect that new research can dissolve old disagreements . Economists Zubin Jelveh , Bruce Kogut , and Suresh Naidu have found that you can predict , pretty accurately , most economists ’ views on whether the minimum wage costs jobs based on their existing political leanings .
That doesn ’ t mean that the researchers working on the question are dishonest — everyone agrees that Dube , Neumark , etc . are all incredibly smart conscientious researchers who just happen to disagree on this topic . But it does reflect that there are structural forces at work here . There are big monied interests opposed to minimum wage increases , and smaller but real monied interests ( specifically unions ) supportive of them , and that political economy naturally leads to a polarized knowledge base over time .
“ You ’ ve got to make some normative judgments , which make economists really uncomfortable , ” Strain says . Is it worth accepting a risk of higher disemployment for higher wages overall — which seems to be a reliable result of minimum wage increases ? How high a risk of disemployment are you willing to accept so that the workers who don ’ t get laid off get raises ?
At this point , personally , I think the trade-off at most margins suggests a higher minimum wage is a good idea . As Dube ’ s review suggests , most estimates of the employment elasticity aren ’ t close to -1 , despite some studies finding effects in that range . That ’ s a wonky way of saying that even if employment falls , it falls by less than wages rise by , and as such the benefits for low-wage workers seem to swamp any employment effects .
I ’ ve very open to that changing as minimums get higher . But we do seem to have learned something very important since the initial Card/Krueger wave : the old assumption that minimum wages are always unacceptably distortionary doesn ’ t really hold water . They ’ re often beneficial and at what point they stop being beneficial is something we can test empirically rather than relying just on theory .","For at least the last 25 years, labor economists have been compiling reams of evidence trying to answer one big question: Do minimum wage laws cost us jobs?

In introductory economics courses, students are typically taught that setting price floors — on milk, oil, or labor — causes supply to exceed demand. In the case of labor, what that means is that if there’s a minimum wage, employers’ demand for workers falls (because they cost more), and the supply of workers increases (because they’re promised more money) — meaning there’s unemployment, with all the costs and suffering that entails.

In sharp contrast to the US, the debate there is about the speed and level of minimum wage increases, rather than on whether or not they occur at all.

Dube thus focuses heavily on the UK’s own experience launching a national minimum wage in 1998, exactly 60 years after the US set a national minimum. But he also reviews the evidence in the US, including more recent studies in cities like Seattle, Chicago, Washington DC, Oakland, San Francisco, and San Jose, as well as studies examining minimum wage increases in Hungary and Germany. Dube collects 55 estimates of the minimum wage’s impact on employment across the world, including 36 estimates from the US, and two estimates for the US and UK that he produced for the report.

Throughout he seeks to estimate the “own-wage elasticity” (OWE) in each context: the increase in wages for a given group caused by an increase in the minimum wage, divided by the change in that group’s probability of employment caused by the minimum wage increase. An OWE of negative 1, for instance, is a “break-even” number: If wages for, say, fast food workers rise 10 percent following a minimum wage increase, then an OWE of -1 suggests odds of employment would fall 10 percent in turn.

The median study looking at a broad group of low-wage workers estimates an “elasticity” of -0.04; that is, a 25-percent increase in average wages for a given group due to a minimum wage increase should lead to a 1 percent decline in employment for that group. That’s a really small effect, and one that suggests the benefits of a modest minimum wage hike should swamp the costs.

Studies looking at smaller groups of workers more likely to be bound by a minimum wage, like teenagers, find bigger effects: if you include studies looking at any size of group, the average OWE is -0.17. But that still implies that disemployment effects are swamped by higher wages.

That evidence base is enough for many labor economists, like Harvard’s Larry Katz, to conclude that we know reasonably well that modest minimum wage increases do more good than harm. “I’ve had many students on both sides of these debates,” Katz says. “When [minimum wages] affect non-traded goods sectors, which is largely true in the US, they clearly increase the wages for low-wage workers impacted. They seem to have very modest impacts on employment.”

The evolution of minimum wage studies

Dube’s review is the latest salvo in a contentious debate that has evolved in interesting directions. When modern minimum wage research began in the 1990s, there were two dominant approaches.

One approach, pioneered by Card and Krueger, compared border counties in neighboring states, one of which increased the minimum wage and one of which didn’t. The other, used by UC Irvine’s David Neumark and the Fed Board of Governors’ William Wascher, tracked employment in full states over time, to see if employment fell in the wake of a minimum wage increase. The two methodologies tended to get different results: Card and Krueger, of course, found no employment effects, while Neumark and Wascher tended to find substantial job loss following minimum wage increases.

Each approach, however, had drawbacks. Card and Krueger’s approach focused on one specific case — New Jersey’s minimum wage hikes — that might not generalize to the country as a whole. The minimum wage increase also might have forced Pennsylvania employers to raise their wages in response, which could make Pennsylvania a bad control group: it’s not unaffected by the minimum wage increase in New Jersey, it’s also affected.

The Neumark/Wascher approach, by contrast, relied on comparisons between states that might otherwise be very different. There are a million reasons why, say, employment might have grown more slowly in California following a minimum wage increase than in Arizona. Neumark and Wascher generally used few “control” variables in an effort to keep the comparison clean and avoid “over-controlling” and accidentally ignoring effects that are due to the minimum wage, but critics argued this could lead them to erroneously blame the minimum wage for job losses that were totally unrelated.

The varying approaches could lead to different evidence reviews drawing quite different conclusions. A 2007 paper by Neumark and Wascher concluded that the “most credible” studies found that the minimum wage costs a substantial number of jobs. Meanwhile, a paper by Dale Belman and Paul Wolfson first published in 2015 found that most credible research estimates minimal effect on jobs.

One thing that happened between 2007 and 2015 is that economists devised better methods. Researchers led by Dube have pioneered a new method of border-county comparisons that extends nationally: starting in a 2010 paper, Dube, T. William Lester, and Michael Reich compared “all contiguous county-pairs in the United States that are located on opposite sides of a state border,” a vast expansion of the general Card-Krueger approach. That creates a much larger sample and enables a nationwide study, rather than one limited to just, say, New Jersey.

That study found no noticeable effect on employment. It also tested for spillovers — an increased minimum wage in one state raising wages in the state next door — and found they were negligible.

More recently in their 2019 Quarterly Journal of Economics paper, Dube, Cengiz, Lindner, and Zipperer find that much of the disagreement between the Card/Krueger and Neumark/Wascher approaches is attributable to a quirk in the late 1980s and early 1990s. During that period, blue states experienced an economic downturn relative to red states that predated the biggest blue state minimum wage increases; that made it look like minimum wages were lowering employment growth, when what was really happening was that blue states both had lower employment growth and separately increased their minimum wages.

“In our QJE paper we showed that the specifications under argument (lot of controls, little controls) actually all suggest little job loss in the post 1995 period; and that this appears to be driven by the quirky 80s boom/bust,” Dube told me. “None of us knew this until recently. This is actually progress.”

What skeptics argue

But new research arguing for substantial disemployment effects has emerged too. Jonathan Meer of Texas A&M and Jeremy West of UC Santa Cruz in a 2016 paper found that while short-run employment isn’t affected by increases in the minimum wage, states that raised their minimums saw slower job growth in subsequent years.

This makes some intuitive sense: you might expect a coffee shop that sees its wage minimum rise from $9 to $12, say, to not actively lay off any employees, but to hire fewer people in the future. Meer and West argued that focusing on employment levels, rather than rates, produced much of the disagreement in the literature up to that point, because it made estimates sensitive to what trends in employment existed before the minimum wage increase.

This led to a fierce back and forth between Meer and West and Dube. Dube in a 2013 study argued that the job growth slowdown in Meer and West showed up disproportionately in manufacturing, where wages are too high to be affected by the minimum wage, suggesting that their model picked up some noise that wasn’t related to the minimum wage at all — and added that using his methodology to look at employment growth, you didn’t find any effects at all.

Meer and West countered that when you add appropriate controls, the industries seeing slower job growth aren’t weird or surprising; a recent paper by Doruk Cengiz using machine learning to decompose the employment effects that Meer and West discuss suggests they’re mostly among higher-wage individuals, which bolsters Dube’s critique.

Another skeptic, UC San Diego’s Jeffrey Clemens, had one paper included in Dube’s review. Written with Michael Wither, it estimated significant job losses due to the 2007 increase in the federal minimum wage amidst the Great Recession.

Clemens argues that other important studies did not get sufficient emphasis in Dube’s review. He names, for instance, a paper by MIT’s John Horton where an online labor market — it’s not Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, but that’s a good comparison — randomly imposed minimum wages for some firms posting jobs, and not others. The firms with minimums reduced hiring and hours worked, pivoting away from low-productivity workers to high-productivity ones. That’s a true experiment, and one that suggests some disemployment effects.

Clemens also points to a Danish study examining youth employment. Denmark’s union-negotiated minimum wages kick in at age 18, and, sure enough, the study finds that employment drops by a third when 17-year-olds turn 18, suggesting large-scale unemployment due to a minimum wage.

Dube actually did include this one in his study, but notes it’s a very different policy from a broad-based minimum wage. “Employers can costlessly substitute higher paid, slightly older workers for identical but lower-paid, slightly younger ones,” in Denmark, he says. “There is very clear reason why you’d expect more job loss in this context, but there is no equivalent for this for, say, a broad based minimum wage policy.”

The online and Denmark studies use extremely credible designs that are arguably better than most of the cross-border or cross-state comparisons that dominate minimum wage research. But they lack “external validity”: it’s not clear that an online task marketplace is a good model for the US labor market, to say the least, and the Denmark example has the problems that Dube notes.

A $15 minimum wage

Another study that Dube includes in his review deserves special comment.

Seattle, Washington was one of the first major cities to vote to gradually increase its minimum wage to $15 an hour, and the University of Washington has been conducting a large-scale ongoing study to see what effect that hike has. The most recent report from the study suggests that increasing the minimum to $13 an hour reduced work hours, but raised wages by enough that low-income workers as a whole were better off on average. That doesn’t mean that all low-income workers were better off, though, and the study suggests that many had to find work outside Seattle to supplement their incomes.

An earlier study from the project found much larger negative effects on employment. That study came under intense criticism for data limitations (it doesn’t include employers with locations both in Seattle and outside, because the part of Washington outside of Seattle serves as the control group). The effects it estimated were extremely large relative to other studies in the literature, and many labor economists like Harvard’s Lawrence Katz don’t find the research reliable. “The Seattle study is completely uninformative because there’s no comparison group for Seattle,” Katz says. “It’s the fastest growing labor market we’ve basically ever seen.”

Reliable or not, the Seattle studies have gotten outsized attention because they represent the first wave of studies on the new mega-increases in the minimum wage following the Fight for $15 movement. California, DC, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York are all gradually increasing their minimums to $15 an hour; even more rural/lower-wage states like Arkansas, Maine, and Missouri are gradually increasing their minimums to $11 or $12.

Dube notes in his review that the best evidence we have suggests minimal job impacts on minimum wages of up to 60 percent of the median wage. The median hourly wage in El Centro, California is about $15.50, meaning the $13 an hour minimum (effective January 1 of next year) is over 80 percent of the median wage there. The effects there might be very different.

Dube addresses this concern in his review, noting that a recent study looking at counties that have already raised their minimum wages to over 80 percent of the median wage still found minimal effects.

But there’s sure to be additional research as the new wages are phased in, and everyone in the debate, from Dube to Meer, thinks there’s some point where the disemployment effects become too large. What we don’t know is if any wage increases passed to this point will reach that level.

“Most of the $15 minimum wage proposals are phased in over multiple years and are probably like $11/$12 today,” Katz notes. “If you told me we’re going to $15 tomorrow I would worry about low-wage states. If you told me over five, six, seven years, I’m not super-worried.”

Clemens and AEI’s Michael Strain are doing precommitted studies on the minimum wage — where they agree to use a certain kind of analysis ahead of time — to ensure they don’t change analytical method to get a specific result later. So far they’ve found mixed results, with bigger job losses from bigger increases and little effect from smaller increases in the minimum wage. And they’re hardly the only ones who will be looking.

This debate will rage for a while

It’s easy to become pessimistic about the prospect that new research can dissolve old disagreements. Economists Zubin Jelveh, Bruce Kogut, and Suresh Naidu have found that you can predict, pretty accurately, most economists’ views on whether the minimum wage costs jobs based on their existing political leanings.

That doesn’t mean that the researchers working on the question are dishonest — everyone agrees that Dube, Neumark, etc. are all incredibly smart conscientious researchers who just happen to disagree on this topic. But it does reflect that there are structural forces at work here. There are big monied interests opposed to minimum wage increases, and smaller but real monied interests (specifically unions) supportive of them, and that political economy naturally leads to a polarized knowledge base over time.

“You’ve got to make some normative judgments, which make economists really uncomfortable,” Strain says. Is it worth accepting a risk of higher disemployment for higher wages overall — which seems to be a reliable result of minimum wage increases? How high a risk of disemployment are you willing to accept so that the workers who don’t get laid off get raises?

At this point, personally, I think the trade-off at most margins suggests a higher minimum wage is a good idea. As Dube’s review suggests, most estimates of the employment elasticity aren’t close to -1, despite some studies finding effects in that range. That’s a wonky way of saying that even if employment falls, it falls by less than wages rise by, and as such the benefits for low-wage workers seem to swamp any employment effects.

I’ve very open to that changing as minimums get higher. But we do seem to have learned something very important since the initial Card/Krueger wave: the old assumption that minimum wages are always unacceptably distortionary doesn’t really hold water. They’re often beneficial and at what point they stop being beneficial is something we can test empirically rather than relying just on theory.

Two Republicans running the banking committees have both said they plan to explore proposals from the outspoken , former Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher that would roll back a long-standing provision that gives the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank an automatic position as vice chairman of a powerful committee and weaken New York ’ s oversight of Wall Street banks .
The politics may be ripe for chipping away at the power of the Federal Reserve , uniting liberals who want to crack down on Wall Street , Republicans who don ’ t like the Fed ’ s easy money policies and libertarians who are suspicious of the Fed altogether .
The move also reflects some regional rivalries within the Fed — the New York Federal Reserve Bank often overshadows other regional banks , and Fisher , known as a rabble rouser in Federal Reserve politics , has been lobbying for a change to the power structure .
Banking Chairman Richard Shelby ( R-Ala. ) and House Financial Services Jeb Hensarling ( R-Texas ) say they ’ re open to reducing the power of the New York Fed , and the move has the potential to appeal to Democrats who have been critical of the Fed , like Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D-Mass ) .
“ Mr . Fisher ’ s proposal dealing with the Fed and the Federal Open Market Committee — we ’ re going to pursue all that and that would include the role of the New York Fed , ” Shelby said last week .
And some Democrats have also said they ’ re open to policies that shift power away from the New York Fed .
“ The New York Fed plays an extraordinary role , and maybe it ’ s extraordinarily captured , but it also represents only 6 percent of the population , ” said Rep. Brad Sherman , ( D-Calif. ) who wants to give a permanent vote on monetary policy decisions to the San Francisco Fed , which serves nine western states and 20 percent of the population .

He also spent much of the 1990s running his own investment firm .
Some Republicans like Fisher , because he often bucked the majority on the Fed , opposing the continued expansion of economic stimulus measures , which he called “ monetary Ritalin ” for the markets . Fisher is considered a “ hawk , ” a monetary conservative who worries most about inflation , which jives with the thinking of Republicans and their policies .
“ I have the highest regard for Richard Fisher , he ’ ll certainly be missed , his voice on monetary policy , ” said Hensarling , who represents part of Dallas , although not Fisher .
Fisher is also known for being one of the louder voices calling for regulators to chop up the giant megabanks into smaller banks . And two years ago , he took an unprecedented step for a Fed president of attending the an annual gathering of conservatives , Conservative Political Action Conference , to make the case for breaking up Wall Street giants .
The big question now is whether his proposals can make it into legislative text .
While Shelby likes the idea , other senators on his committee , including Republican Bob Corker and Democrats Jack Reed and Heidi Heitkamp said they ’ re not ready to weigh in . For his part , Reed has a different bill to require the president of the New York Fed to be presidentially appointed and confirmed by Congress rather than selected by its board .
However , the ranking Democrat on the panel , Sen. Sherrod Brown , is cool to the proposal and said he doesn ’ t think Fisher ’ s proposal “ changes much. ” And Sen. Bob . Menendez ( D-N.J. ) said he has concerns about shifting power away from the New York Fed .
“ I think the New York Fed plays an important role in the Fed system . And I don ’ t take lightly to some of the changes being discussed , ” Menendez said . “ Some of what I ’ ve seen is too far reaching . ”
When ███ asked about the proposal in a press conference recently , Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said she thinks the current system “ works well , ” and that there were good reasons for the current structure giving New York a permanent spot on the FOMC . But she added it was up to Congress .
The Dallas Federal Reserve said Fisher was unavailable to comment in his last week on the job , but a spokesman confirmed Fisher has been fielding questions from lawmakers on the hill on his proposal .
And Fisher is reportedly thrilled that there ’ s interest in this idea , said Camden Fine , president and CEO of the Independent Community Bankers of America , which is also pushing for Fisher ’ s proposal . Fine said he spoke with Fisher just last week about the idea , which “ would balance the Federal Reserve , ” and reflect that “ economic centers are no longer concentrated on Manhattan island , ” Fine said .
Fisher also assured Fine that his retirement from the Dallas Fed won ’ t dampen his enthusiastic voice for pushing his proposals . “ He ’ s not going anywhere , ” Fine said .","A move to shift power away from the New York Federal Reserve Bank is finding some powerful friends in Congress amid lingering worries that a key part of the central bank is too cozy with Wall Street.

Two Republicans running the banking committees have both said they plan to explore proposals from the outspoken, former Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher that would roll back a long-standing provision that gives the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank an automatic position as vice chairman of a powerful committee and weaken New York’s oversight of Wall Street banks.

The politics may be ripe for chipping away at the power of the Federal Reserve, uniting liberals who want to crack down on Wall Street, Republicans who don’t like the Fed’s easy money policies and libertarians who are suspicious of the Fed altogether.

The move also reflects some regional rivalries within the Fed — the New York Federal Reserve Bank often overshadows other regional banks, and Fisher, known as a rabble rouser in Federal Reserve politics, has been lobbying for a change to the power structure.

Banking Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) and House Financial Services Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) say they’re open to reducing the power of the New York Fed, and the move has the potential to appeal to Democrats who have been critical of the Fed, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass).

“Mr. Fisher’s proposal dealing with the Fed and the Federal Open Market Committee — we’re going to pursue all that and that would include the role of the New York Fed,” Shelby said last week.

And some Democrats have also said they’re open to policies that shift power away from the New York Fed.

“The New York Fed plays an extraordinary role, and maybe it’s extraordinarily captured, but it also represents only 6 percent of the population,” said Rep. Brad Sherman, (D-Calif.) who wants to give a permanent vote on monetary policy decisions to the San Francisco Fed, which serves nine western states and 20 percent of the population.

Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), a moderate who said he hasn’t taken a position on the proposals yet, said, “I do think there’s been some legitimate questions of the role of the New York Fed.”

Fisher, who retired Thursday after 10 years at the Dallas Fed, wants to yank the New York Fed’s permanent position as vice chair of the all-powerful Federal Open Market Committee, the panel charged with making monetary policy decisions, which met Wednesday.

While the New York Fed president could still participate in monetary policy discussions, he or she would no longer always get a vote. Fisher suggested the job should rotate among the regional Federal Reserve Banks every two years.

The move would upend the current structure, as the New York Fed has had a lock on that spot since 1936, thanks largely to its role as the infrastructure, which supplies the trading desk that carries out the Fed’s monetary policy decisions.

The president seeks to frame the political debate with major budget , debt issues looming
An Obama goal is to put new pressure on Republicans to work with Democrats
President Barack Obama vowed Wednesday to focus his energy for the rest of his presidency on the core tenet of his election victories -- equal opportunity for all Americans -- starting with campaign-style speeches on the economy that appeared to launch this year 's budget battle with Republicans .
Confronting the deep partisan divide over federal spending , tax reform and raising the debt ceiling later this year , Obama told a large crowd at the University of Central Missouri in Warrensburg that reversing a growing inequality between haves and have-nots should be the top priority of Congress .
He chastised Congress for inaction and vowed to take matters into his own hands during the remaining 1,276 days he has in office .
`` Where I can act on my own , I 'm going to . I 'm not going to wait for Congress , '' he said in the second of two speeches that kicked off a series of economic-themed addresses across the country .
It was a sentiment he expressed earlier in the day during a speech to hundreds at Knox College in Galesburg , Illinois .
`` This growing inequality is n't just morally wrong ; it 's bad economics , '' Obama said .
During the speech at Knox College , he blended populist imagery from his campaign stump speech last year with the criticism of conservative Republicans who , according to the president , only stood for repealing his signature 2010 health care reform law and slashing federal spending in an effort to shrink government .
`` Repealing Obamacare and cutting spending is not an economic plan . It 's not , '' Obama said , challenging the political right to work with him on budget and tax polices that promote economic fairness for all , especially the middle class and people aspiring to join it .
His voice rising , Obama declared that `` the one thing I care about is how to use every minute of the remaining 1,276 days of my term to make this country work for working Americans again . ''
As the audience stood to applaud and cheer , he added : `` That 's all I care about . I do n't have another election . ''
Earlier Wednesday , White House spokesman Jay Carney acknowledged to CNN that a goal of Obama 's speeches was to ratchet up pressure on Republicans to work with Democrats and the president , noting that `` in the end , members of Congress respond to their constituents . ''
Republicans called Obama 's speeches a retread strategy that lacked fresh ideas to further bolster an economy that everyone agrees should be growing faster .
`` We 've heard most of it before , '' GOP Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama told CNN , adding that Obama 's economic policies had failed .
`` He 's a good politician , '' Shelby said of Obama , noting that the president was telling people what they wanted to hear . `` But he 's not doing what he needs to do to create good jobs . ''
Despite slow but steady growth over the past four years , polls show many Americans are still concerned about unemployment and the economy overall even though indicators show an improving recovery and Wall Street is again in record territory .
Two new surveys on Wednesday indicated less than half of Americans approve of the president 's handling of the economy . Both polls , by NBC News/Wall Street Journal and ABC News/Washington Post , found more respondents disapprove of how Obama has dealt with the economy , which remained the top issue for the public .
The first six months of Obama 's second term have been dominated by issues like gun violence and immigration reform , with legislation on both currently mired in partisan wrangling , as well as controversies such as Internal Revenue Service targeting of groups seeking tax-exempt status .
His speeches Wednesday sought to reframe the political debate as the government approaches the end of its fiscal year on September 30 and a potential shutdown if Congress fails to overcome the gridlock that has become its trademark .
Knox College is where Obama delivered his first major economic address of his national political career eight years ago , and he used the setting to emphasize progress made since then in overcoming the recession his administration inherited to launch a slow but steady economic recovery .
At the same time , Obama said the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century demanded new thinking and policies to capitalize on America 's potential and end the pattern of worsening inequality from previous decades .
He called for Washington to focus on `` rebuilding our manufacturing base , educating our workforce , upgrading our transportation systems , upgrading our information networks '' instead of what he labeled `` an endless parade of distractions , political posturing and phony scandals . ''
Obama was particularly tough on conservative House Republicans , whom he blamed for blocking progress on issues such as immigration reform agreed to by their GOP colleagues in the Senate .
He said he would work with anyone with good ideas while using executive authority and calling on on business leaders , philanthropists , labor leaders -- `` anybody who can help '' -- to push for economic changes promoting equal opportunity .
`` I will not allow gridlock or inaction or willful indifference to get in our way , '' Obama said .
Later in the day , Obama headed to the University of Central Missouri in Warrensburg for another address expected to focus on education .
Regardless of the political focus of recent months , the national debate was certain to focus on the federal budget this summer and fall .
Pitched political battles over spending and taxes have dominated Obama 's presidency , and Republican leaders spurred on by conservative House Republicans facing congressional elections next year are threatening hardline negotiating tactics over the budget and affiliated issues of tax reform and forced spending cuts known as sequestration that took effect this year .
Both the Republican-majority House and Democratic-majority Senate have passed spending proposals for fiscal year 2014 , but the measures bear little resemblance to each other in terms of priorities .
Any attempt to reconcile differences through negotiation faces complications from related issues such as whether the sweeping government spending cuts that took effect in March and hit the military and discretionary accounts hard should continue unchanged .
Another potential landmine is the opposition by conservative Republicans , including some GOP leaders in Congress , to funding the implementation of the health care reform law pushed through by Democrats with Obama 's backing in 2010 .
Further complicating the debate is the certain need for Congress to authorize an increase in the government 's borrowing limit , or debt ceiling , sometime this fall .
House Speaker John Boehner has made clear that any rise in the debt ceiling would require an equal cut in government spending to get GOP support , a demand known as the Boehner rule as set by the Ohio Republican .
The White House has said it will not negotiate on the debt ceiling , and some congressional Republicans balk at linking it to specific demands , such as cuts in funds for implementing health care reform , but insist that more must be done to reduce deficits and debt .
`` I think holding the debt limit a hostage to any specific thing is probably not the best negotiating place , '' GOP Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri told MSNBC . `` Where we ought to be now is , we need more spending cuts . ''
Blunt specifically called for reforms to popular entitlement programs such as Medicare , Medicaid and Social Security to reduce their costs `` so they last . ''
However , Democrats and Republicans remain far apart on entitlements , long a target of conservatives seeking to shrink government , especially programs that they say lead to federal dependence .
Democrats argue the government pension program and health care for the elderly and poor are part of a vital social contract that ensures the well-being of vulnerable citizens .
Obama said Wednesday that Democrats must `` question old assumptions '' and `` be willing to redesign or get rid of programs that do n't work as well as they should . ''
He has come under fire from some liberals for already proposing a change in how the annual cost-of-living index for federal benefits gets calculated as part of a broad but so far unreachable deficit reduction deal with Republicans .","Story highlights President Obama takes on Republican foes, vowing to take matters into his own hands

Two new surveys on Wednesday indicated less than half of Americans approve of the president's handling of the economy. Both polls, by NBC News/Wall Street Journal and ABC News/Washington Post, found more respondents disapprove of how Obama has dealt with the economy, which remained the top issue for the public.

The first six months of Obama's second term have been dominated by issues like gun violence and immigration reform, with legislation on both currently mired in partisan wrangling, as well as controversies such as Internal Revenue Service targeting of groups seeking tax-exempt status.

Reframing political debate

His speeches Wednesday sought to reframe the political debate as the government approaches the end of its fiscal year on September 30 and a potential shutdown if Congress fails to overcome the gridlock that has become its trademark.

Knox College is where Obama delivered his first major economic address of his national political career eight years ago, and he used the setting to emphasize progress made since then in overcoming the recession his administration inherited to launch a slow but steady economic recovery.

At the same time, Obama said the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century demanded new thinking and policies to capitalize on America's potential and end the pattern of worsening inequality from previous decades.

He called for Washington to focus on ""rebuilding our manufacturing base, educating our workforce, upgrading our transportation systems, upgrading our information networks"" instead of what he labeled ""an endless parade of distractions, political posturing and phony scandals.""

Obama was particularly tough on conservative House Republicans, whom he blamed for blocking progress on issues such as immigration reform agreed to by their GOP colleagues in the Senate.

He said he would work with anyone with good ideas while using executive authority and calling on on business leaders, philanthropists, labor leaders -- ""anybody who can help"" -- to push for economic changes promoting equal opportunity.

""I will not allow gridlock or inaction or willful indifference to get in our way,"" Obama said.

Later in the day, Obama headed to the University of Central Missouri in Warrensburg for another address expected to focus on education.

Looming budget battle

Regardless of the political focus of recent months, the national debate was certain to focus on the federal budget this summer and fall.

Pitched political battles over spending and taxes have dominated Obama's presidency, and Republican leaders spurred on by conservative House Republicans facing congressional elections next year are threatening hardline negotiating tactics over the budget and affiliated issues of tax reform and forced spending cuts known as sequestration that took effect this year.

Both the Republican-majority House and Democratic-majority Senate have passed spending proposals for fiscal year 2014, but the measures bear little resemblance to each other in terms of priorities.

Any attempt to reconcile differences through negotiation faces complications from related issues such as whether the sweeping government spending cuts that took effect in March and hit the military and discretionary accounts hard should continue unchanged.

Another potential landmine is the opposition by conservative Republicans, including some GOP leaders in Congress, to funding the implementation of the health care reform law pushed through by Democrats with Obama's backing in 2010.

Further complicating the debate is the certain need for Congress to authorize an increase in the government's borrowing limit, or debt ceiling, sometime this fall.

'The Boehner rule'

House Speaker John Boehner has made clear that any rise in the debt ceiling would require an equal cut in government spending to get GOP support, a demand known as the Boehner rule as set by the Ohio Republican.

The White House has said it will not negotiate on the debt ceiling, and some congressional Republicans balk at linking it to specific demands, such as cuts in funds for implementing health care reform, but insist that more must be done to reduce deficits and debt.

""I think holding the debt limit a hostage to any specific thing is probably not the best negotiating place,"" GOP Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri told MSNBC. ""Where we ought to be now is, we need more spending cuts.""

Blunt specifically called for reforms to popular entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security to reduce their costs ""so they last.""

However, Democrats and Republicans remain far apart on entitlements, long a target of conservatives seeking to shrink government, especially programs that they say lead to federal dependence.

Democrats argue the government pension program and health care for the elderly and poor are part of a vital social contract that ensures the well-being of vulnerable citizens.

Obama said Wednesday that Democrats must ""question old assumptions"" and ""be willing to redesign or get rid of programs that don't work as well as they should.""

He has come under fire from some liberals for already proposing a change in how the annual cost-of-living index for federal benefits gets calculated as part of a broad but so far unreachable deficit reduction deal with Republicans.",www.cnn.com,left,H4PDxDLRsIPGkUfO

Hillary Clinton isn't over the finish line yet, but as she continues to battle Bernie Sanders she's also turning her attention to a general election matchup with Donald Trump.

A lot of Democrats say that in order to beat Trump, she needs to be developing a clearer message on the economy.

That's not Donald Trump's problem.

Not only does he have a simple, clear message — he often says so himself.

""Our theme is very simple,"" Trump reminded voters last week after winning the Indiana primary. ""Make America great again. We will make America great again. We will start winning again.""

Behind that simple message, there are a host of equally simple sounding policies — policies aimed right at Americans' economic insecurities. Build a wall, dump the bad trade deals, deport 11 million immigrants in the country illegally. Love those ideas or loathe them, it's crystal clear what Trump wants to do.

Not so much with Clinton.

Asked what, in one sentence, Clinton wants to do, here's what David Axelrod, President Obama's former strategist, said:

""I don't think Hillary Clinton wants to do anything in one sentence,"" said Axelrod. ""That's the problem, right? She wants to do things in paragraphs and pages. This has always been a problem in that she is incredibly fluent in policy, she embraces good policy ideas, but she has a hard time weaving them into a coherent narrative that cuts through.""

This isn't the first time Clinton has run against an opponent with a big dramatic message. In 2008, it was ""hope"" and ""change.""

This year, both Bernie Sanders and Trump have big plans for change: build a wall, break up the banks, make a political revolution. This is what political professionals call an origin story — a clear rationale for how we got here, and who is to blame for it.

Does Clinton Need An 'Origin Story'?

Democratic pollster Celinda Lake says Clinton needs her own origin story. She needs to tell voters why they are struggling.

""Why are we not competitive? Why do we not have manufacturing jobs?"" said Lake. ""We're Americans after all. We're supposed to be able to ensure the next generation has a better chance. That's why all of our families or most of our families came here. That's why all of our families stayed here.""

Clinton has a lot of programs to address the economic worries of what she's called everyday Americans — paid family leave, debt free college, affordable child care. But she rarely sums it all up.

She has been experimenting with one big theme, which she calls ""Breaking Down Barriers."" It's a message aimed at women, Hispanics and African-Americans.

But she does it in her own policy-wonkish way.

""She's someone who always starts from what you can get done,"" said her campaign chairman, John Podesta. ""What's holding people back? What are the barriers people are facing? Whether that's institutional racism or an economy that's rigged for the people at the top. And what can I do about it? That's where she is not only most comfortable, but I think she thinks that's how change happens.""

Clinton's Problem Is Democrats' Problem, Too

Coming up with a clear economic message isn't just a problem for Hillary Clinton. It's a problem for Democrats in general. In Celinda Lake's polls, Democrats are consistently behind Republicans on the issue of the economy. In recent general election polls, where Clinton beats Trump handily in the horse race, the economy is the only issue where he beats her. And the economy is THE No. 1 issue. Democrats have never won a presidential election when they're losing on the economy.

""We're starting from a deficit in that,"" said Lake.

""So it makes it really, really important to articulate a powerful economic origin story and a plan that sums up to the scale of the problems we have. People love her individual policies, but they want to make sure they add up to something big enough to deal with the incredibly entrenched economic problems we have.""

What could be Clinton's big idea?

Debt-free college? A major infrastructure program? She hasn't decided yet.

And she has some challenges. In the fall, she'll be running against an unpredictable populist, with positions that are to her left and to her right.

And she has a gender problem.

Trump beats Clinton on the economy not just because he's a businessman — candidates from the business world get an automatic advantage on creating jobs — but because she's a woman. Lake's polling shows that female candidates from both parties are rated behind men on the economy and jobs. Maybe, Lake suggests, because women are too responsible to go for the big sweeping narrative. Clinton has done a little self-analysis on this problem.

Those surveys also show 42 percent of 2010 voters described themselves as `` conservative , '' significantly higher than the 35 percent who said that in 2012 .

When you ask me about humility , I did n't see any of it . ''
Morris , meanwhile , found that Obama 's lack of admission to the numerous errors surrounding the Affordable Care Act rollout was tantamount to being `` ashamed '' without having to apologize . He , too , thinks the minimum wage and other issues are designed to distract from the Obamacare debacle .
`` I mean it 's his signature program and he let the whole speech go by before he talked about it . I 've written two State of the Union speeches . My attitude here is that this one was very boring , very hard to listen [ to ] , '' added Morris , a former adviser to President Clinton , saying the address lacked the strength of presenting `` bite-sized achievements '' while going overboard on `` trying to govern through executive action . ''
Democratic political analyst and pollster Doug Schoen told ███ that the address itself was largely `` a rehash of what we 've heard before : 'Thank you very much , goodnight . ' ''
`` It provided nothing that will demonstrate leadership to the American people , '' he said . `` He made a real effort to connect with people by using individual examples , but I 'm not sure if he achieved much of anything . ''
Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida also had sharp criticism for the president 's expanded authority and the plan to push a minimum wage hike .

New 'Obamacare Survival Guide ' Reveals Dangers Ahead for Your Healthcare
This year , the U.S. Senate is the prize . Republicans need a net gain of six seats to win control of that chamber . The results will shape the final two years of Obama 's presidency and determine how much resistance he 'll encounter from Congress .
Mike Murphy , a Republican consultant who has advised several presidential campaigns , said his party ca n't ignore the potential power of Obama 's message and simply propose tax cuts as their sole idea for economic opportunity .
`` We should take the president 's campaign offense seriously , '' he said . `` Our connection to voters on economics has been slipping , and we have to address that . ''
Obama told Americans they essentially have a choice between a nation where all have a chance to improve their lot in life , or one where prosperity is achieved by just a few .
With national unemployment at 6.7 percent — down 1.1 percentage points since Obama took office in January 2009 — the economy remains the top issue for most voters and Democrats see economic fairness as a winning message .
`` Opportunity is who we are , '' Obama said . `` And the defining project of our generation must be to restore that promise . ''
In his call for an increase in the minimum wage , Obama pointed to polling that shows support for a boost and sold it as an economic development tool — and a campaign mantra .
`` This will help families , '' he said . `` It will give businesses customers with more money to spend . It does not involve any new bureaucratic program . So join the rest of the country . Say yes . Give America a raise . ''
Representative Paul Ryan said Obama 's plan would backfire on workers .
`` It 's bad economics , '' the Wisconsin Republican said on CNBC today . `` What we want is more people to enter into the workforce . We do n't want to make it more expensive for employers to be able to hire people . ''
In all , the president announced a dozen actions that he said would help push against the economic forces that have left lower- and middle-income Americans suffering from the worst recession in more than seven decades . He also said he 's enlisting companies , including Apple and Verizon , to help solve issues from expanding broadband in schools to hiring the long-term unemployed .
Obama appealed for cooperation from the divided Congress on other priorities , including immigration , corporate taxes , trade , transportation , and an expansion of the earned income tax credit to aid the working poor .
The president 's message is designed to shore up his support among Democrats rather than winning over the independent voters who decide most elections , said Whit Ayres , a Virginia-based Republican polling consultant .
`` It is totally a Democrat base play , '' he said . `` They are going back to a timeless class-warfare play to try to distract people from Obamacare . ''
Democratic polling expert Geoff Garin , who worked for Hillary Clinton 's presidential campaign in 2008 , countered that Obama 's message will be a strong one because Americans increasingly think it 's hard to stay in the middle class and even harder to get there .
`` Mitt was a soft target and the reality is that those do n't come along every day , but the Republican brand is still deeply identified with favoritism with those at the top and corporate interests , '' he said . `` Democrats are much more identified as the party of the middle class . The pump is pretty well primed for voters to think that Republicans will be on the wrong side of these issues . ''
Respondents in a Bloomberg National Poll last month said by a margin of 64 percent to 33 percent that the United States no longer offers everyone an equal chance to get ahead .
With stock portfolios recovering — the Standard & Poor 's 500 Index has more than doubled since Obama took office — the wealthy have shaken off much of the recession .
The top 10 percent of earners — those with household incomes above $ 114,000 — collected more than half the nation 's total income in 2012 , according to a research paper published last year by University of California , Berkeley , economist Emmanuel Saez . That 's the largest proportion since the government started gathering such data in 1917 .
The study also found that those with the top 1 percent of incomes saw their earnings grow 31.4 percent from 2009 , when the recession ended , to 2012 . The bottom 99 percent saw growth of just 0.4 percent .
Vin Weber , a former Republican House member from Minnesota who is now managing partner at Mercury Public Affairs , a Washington-based government relations consulting firm , said he sees at least a small opening for bipartisan compromises in 2014 on such things as education and job training .
`` There is unhappiness with the economy and Obamacare , and that gives a lot of advantages to the Republicans , '' he said . `` Yet if Republicans want to maximize their opportunity in 2014 and be competitive in 2016 , they need to spend some time on a positive agenda . ''
Ron Kaufman , a senior adviser to Romney 's 2012 presidential campaign , said Republicans need to improve their message on economic opportunity to compete with Democrats .
`` We have to do a better job of saying the best thing we can do for people is to grow the pie , '' said Kaufman , a member of the Republican National Committee from Massachusetts . `` What Democrats want to do is make the pie smaller and the pieces bigger . ''

My attitude here is that this one was very boring, very hard to listen [to],"" added Morris, a former adviser to President Clinton, saying the address lacked the strength of presenting ""bite-sized achievements"" while going overboard on ""trying to govern through executive action.""



Democratic political analyst and pollster Doug Schoen told Newsmax that the address itself was largely ""a rehash of what we've heard before: 'Thank you very much, goodnight.'""



""It provided nothing that will demonstrate leadership to the American people,"" he said. ""He made a real effort to connect with people by using individual examples, but I'm not sure if he achieved much of anything.""



Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida also had sharp criticism for the president's expanded authority and the plan to push a minimum wage hike.



""I think it's unfortunate. I think it's divisive and, quite frankly, borderline unconstitutional on many of those issues,"" Rubio told Politico. ""I understand the [legislative] process takes long and can be frustrating, but I think it truly undermines the republic.""

New 'Obamacare Survival Guide' Reveals Dangers Ahead for Your Healthcare

This year, the U.S. Senate is the prize. Republicans need a net gain of six seats to win control of that chamber. The results will shape the final two years of Obama's presidency and determine how much resistance he'll encounter from Congress.

Mike Murphy, a Republican consultant who has advised several presidential campaigns, said his party can't ignore the potential power of Obama's message and simply propose tax cuts as their sole idea for economic opportunity.

""We should take the president's campaign offense seriously,"" he said. ""Our connection to voters on economics has been slipping, and we have to address that.""

Obama told Americans they essentially have a choice between a nation where all have a chance to improve their lot in life, or one where prosperity is achieved by just a few.

With national unemployment at 6.7 percent — down 1.1 percentage points since Obama took office in January 2009 — the economy remains the top issue for most voters and Democrats see economic fairness as a winning message.

""Opportunity is who we are,"" Obama said. ""And the defining project of our generation must be to restore that promise.""

In his call for an increase in the minimum wage, Obama pointed to polling that shows support for a boost and sold it as an economic development tool — and a campaign mantra.

""This will help families,"" he said. ""It will give businesses customers with more money to spend. It does not involve any new bureaucratic program. So join the rest of the country. Say yes. Give America a raise.""

Representative Paul Ryan said Obama's plan would backfire on workers.

""It's bad economics,"" the Wisconsin Republican said on CNBC today. ""What we want is more people to enter into the workforce. We don't want to make it more expensive for employers to be able to hire people.""

In all, the president announced a dozen actions that he said would help push against the economic forces that have left lower- and middle-income Americans suffering from the worst recession in more than seven decades. He also said he's enlisting companies, including Apple and Verizon, to help solve issues from expanding broadband in schools to hiring the long-term unemployed.

Obama appealed for cooperation from the divided Congress on other priorities, including immigration, corporate taxes, trade, transportation, and an expansion of the earned income tax credit to aid the working poor.

The president's message is designed to shore up his support among Democrats rather than winning over the independent voters who decide most elections, said Whit Ayres, a Virginia-based Republican polling consultant.

""It is totally a Democrat base play,"" he said. ""They are going back to a timeless class-warfare play to try to distract people from Obamacare.""

Democratic polling expert Geoff Garin, who worked for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in 2008, countered that Obama's message will be a strong one because Americans increasingly think it's hard to stay in the middle class and even harder to get there.

""Mitt was a soft target and the reality is that those don't come along every day, but the Republican brand is still deeply identified with favoritism with those at the top and corporate interests,"" he said. ""Democrats are much more identified as the party of the middle class. The pump is pretty well primed for voters to think that Republicans will be on the wrong side of these issues.""

Respondents in a Bloomberg National Poll last month said by a margin of 64 percent to 33 percent that the United States no longer offers everyone an equal chance to get ahead.

With stock portfolios recovering — the Standard & Poor's 500 Index has more than doubled since Obama took office — the wealthy have shaken off much of the recession.

The top 10 percent of earners — those with household incomes above $114,000 — collected more than half the nation's total income in 2012, according to a research paper published last year by University of California, Berkeley, economist Emmanuel Saez. That's the largest proportion since the government started gathering such data in 1917.

The study also found that those with the top 1 percent of incomes saw their earnings grow 31.4 percent from 2009, when the recession ended, to 2012. The bottom 99 percent saw growth of just 0.4 percent.

Vin Weber, a former Republican House member from Minnesota who is now managing partner at Mercury Public Affairs, a Washington-based government relations consulting firm, said he sees at least a small opening for bipartisan compromises in 2014 on such things as education and job training.

""There is unhappiness with the economy and Obamacare, and that gives a lot of advantages to the Republicans,"" he said. ""Yet if Republicans want to maximize their opportunity in 2014 and be competitive in 2016, they need to spend some time on a positive agenda.""

Ron Kaufman, a senior adviser to Romney's 2012 presidential campaign, said Republicans need to improve their message on economic opportunity to compete with Democrats.

""We have to do a better job of saying the best thing we can do for people is to grow the pie,"" said Kaufman, a member of the Republican National Committee from Massachusetts. ""What Democrats want to do is make the pie smaller and the pieces bigger.""

The Fed 's deliberations about how and when to scale back the huge sums of money it is pumping into the financial system are of enormous import both to financial markets and the broader economy .

President Barack Obama is calling for private capital to take the lead role in the nation’s mortgage market with the U.S. government continuing to provide a backstop only against catastrophic risk.

The president for the first time is endorsing an approach to remake the housing finance system as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are wound down. He said the government still must play a role to preserve broad access to 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages that underpin the market.

“You can’t have a situation in which the government is underwriting and guaranteeing all the mortgage lending that’s taking place around the country and big profits are being made by these quasi-private institutions,” Obama said. Congress should pass housing legislation by the end of the year, he said.

The president’s remarks today came during a question and answer session in Los Angeles moderated by Spencer Rascoff, chief executive officer of Zillow Inc, operator of the largest real-estate information website. Yesterday in Phoenix Obama delivered a speech on housing policy.

A reduced government role would likely mean that mortgages would become more expensive as the costs of covering risk are shifted from taxpayers to borrowers. A Senate bill containing Obama’s approach would increase interest rates by between 50 and 75 basis points for a typical borrower with a 30-year fixed rate loan, a 20 percent down payment, and a 750 credit score, according to a report by Moody’s Analytics.

Senate Moves

The president’s call for a government mortgage reinsurer coincides with administration officials quietly aiding Senate efforts. Tennessee Republican Bob Corker and Virginia Democrat Mark Warner in June introduced the measure, which would require private capital to take at least 10 percent of the first losses on mortgage securities. The government would step in with more aid during a financial catastrophe.

Separately, Obama said today that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is working on ways to simplify mortgage forms “so that you don’t have a lot of fine print, you know exactly what you’re getting.”

In his speech yesterday in Phoenix, Obama blamed “recklessness” on the part of lenders and borrowers for the housing bubble and subsequent collapse of the market as the nation fell into the deepest recession since the 1930s. Now, he said, the market is healing, with prices rising and foreclosures declining.

Rising Values

“We’ve got to turn the page on this kind of bubble-and-bust mentality that helped to create this mess in the first place,” Obama said. “We’ve got to build a housing system that is durable and fair and rewards responsibility for generations to come.”

Nationwide, real-estate values are climbing at the fastest pace since 2006 as improving employment helps draw buyers into the market for a tight inventory of homes.

Prices rose 7.3 percent in the year through May, according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The number of homes for sale fell 5 percent to 1.74 million in January from the year-earlier period, the fewest since December 1999, according to the National Association of Realtors.

FHA Program

Obama said borrowers with foreclosures or bankruptcies resulting from a job loss will be able to finance a home purchase with a Federal Housing Administration mortgage as long as they are back at work, demonstrate 12 months of timely payments, and complete housing counseling. The FHA, a government mortgage insurer, now requires a three-year wait.

A new system would replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which drew $187.5 billion in aid from the U.S. Treasury after investments in risky loans pushed them to the brink of insolvency. The two companies, which were taken into U.S. conservatorship in 2008, provide liquidity to the mortgage market by buying loans from banks and packaging them into securities on which they guarantee payments of principal and interest, freeing up the banks to make more loans.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac returned to profitability as the housing market rebounded. They’ve paid the Treasury $131.6 billion in dividends, which count as a return on the U.S. investment in the firms and not as a repayment of their debt to taxpayers. Freddie Mac announced today that it will send an additional $4.4 billion to the Treasury Department after continued housing-market improvements allowed the company to post a seventh consecutive profitable quarter.

Warner said in a statement that the bipartisan Senate proposal “will end the current Fannie and Freddie model of private gains and public losses.”

House Plan

In the House, Republicans have drafted a bill that would wind down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with no government-backed replacement. Written by Representative Jeb Hensarling, the Texas Republican who leads the House Financial Services Committee, the measure would leave the FHA as the sole U.S. mortgage backstop. No Democrats are backing the legislation.

The cost of the House bill for borrowers would be even greater than those of the Senate bill, according to Moody’s Analytics. Borrowers would see interest rates rise by 90 basis points if the measure were enacted, Moody’s said.

Hensarling said yesterday that the House version would achieve the goals set out by Obama, and he faulted government policies that he said “browbeat financial institutions to loan money to people to buy homes they ultimately could not afford.”

Additional Steps

The White House would support additional measures ensuring that housing is affordable for first-time homebuyers and renters, according to Obama administration officials.

“We can’t go back to the housing-finance system that we had before,” Shaun Donovan, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, said on Bloomberg Television yesterday. “We can’t go back to a place where trillions and trillions of dollars of wealth is wiped out and the world economy is put at risk.”

The president also called for passage of a new immigration law, citing home purchases by immigrants as a boon to the market.

Why This Economist Says the Fed Is a 'Villain' That's Causing a Disaster,2019-01-07,,"WASHINGTON – Investors hope Friday 's rally on Wall Street will keep going in the weeks ahead .
Stocks took off Friday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank would be patient with future hikes in interest rates .
Many investors have blamed the Fed for the sharp drop in stocks in the last three months because of its plans to keep raising rates .
`` If we were to go into a recession in 2019 , the villain would be the Fed , '' Stephen Moore , former economic advisor to President Donald Trump , told ███ News .
Moore says that in order to become the hero , the Federal Reserve should be lowering – not raising – interest rates .

Stocks took off Friday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank would be patient with future hikes in interest rates.

Many investors have blamed the Fed for the sharp drop in stocks in the last three months because of its plans to keep raising rates.

""If we were to go into a recession in 2019, the villain would be the Fed,"" Stephen Moore, former economic advisor to President Donald Trump, told CBN News.

Moore says that in order to become the hero, the Federal Reserve should be lowering – not raising – interest rates.

""The Fed should absolutely stop raising rates. In fact, they should start cutting rates, reverse the mistakes they made the week before Christmas,"" he said.

That mistake, as Moore puts it, is when the Fed raised interest rates for the fourth time in 2018. Job growth and what had been strong economy last year encouraged the Federal Reserve Board to go for the quarter percent increase.

But Moore says investors clearly saw it as the wrong move because of growing concerns of an economic slowdown and weaker profits for businesses. And they thought higher rates could hurt the economy at a time when it could be getting weaker.

But even without tax cuts, that annual gap between revenue and spending appears poised to rise again – and to drive a parallel surge in public debt from this decade into the future, as obligations for both health-care entitlements and interest on the debt soar.

A key shift

It’s not that politicians aren’t aware of the problem. And some are actively seeking to address it.

But fiscal discipline isn’t viewed as an imperative the way it once more generally was.

Bill White, a former Houston mayor who researched and wrote a book on America’s fiscal history, says a key shift happened in the early 2000s under George W. Bush. President Bush pushed for big tax cuts in 2003 even though the nation was at war, the economy wasn’t in recession, and nonpartisan forecasts showed widening deficits as a result.

Republican strategists had taken note: Bush’s father had been voted out of the White House in 1992 after raising taxes despite a “no new taxes” pledge.

And Mr. White says Democrats have shared the blame of Washington’s shifting fiscal mores. One bipartisan move under Bush was the funding of a new entitlement – prescription-drug benefits under Medicare – without paying for it.

It’s not just politics behind the shift, either. In the wake of the Great Recession, liberal economists have argued the case that fiscal stimulus (jargon for federal spending or tax cuts that can give a short-term boost to the economy) may be justifiable in some nonrecession times. (But for the record: Those economists generally are skeptical that Trump’s tax cuts would raise growth meaningfully.)

A streak of prudence

All this is different from the past, says White.

“The fiscal tradition [of America] recognized the link between decisions on spending and decisions on taxes,” he says.

Conservatives believed that having a visible price tag (taxes) would help put a check on public spending, while progressives saw the need for sustainable funding for a social safety net.

And if Americans aren’t fans of tax hikes, some polls suggest the public has a streak of fiscal prudence that has held pretty steady.

Looking at government, they’ve strongly supported the idea of balanced budgets in polls spanning from 1940 to the early 2000s, according to the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research. And in their personal lives, Americans increasingly see saving money as preferable to spending (at least as an ideal), Gallup surveys find.

Although economists often aren’t fans of strict budgetary balance, they agree on the dangers that too much debt can bring – potentially higher interest rates or a financial panic over default risks.

At the same time, many economists and ordinary Americans say the time is ripe for simplifying the tax system and seeking to make it promote greater economic growth and fairness.

Trump's tax cuts

Those goals took center stage as Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, announced Trump’s proposals Wednesday.

“Washington has taken its eye off the ball,” Obama said in what was billed as a major economic address at Knox College in Galesburg, Ill. “And I am here to say this needs to stop.”

Democratic partisans ate up the lengthy speech, which included a laundry list of old and new proposals, many of which will never become law. And they did not appear to care that the address sounded as much like a workmanlike State of the Union as a sweeping vision of a new economy.

Republicans dismissed the address as familiar, empty rhetoric unhelpful to immediate problems like reaching an agreement in Washington on funding the government and raising the debt ceiling. House Speaker John Boehner called the speech a “hollow shell” and an “Easter egg with no candy in it.”

Here are POLITICO’s five answers to its earlier questions about the speech.

1. How hard will he go after Republicans on the debt ceiling and government funding?

Pretty hard, as it turns out.

Obama was careful to praise a “growing number of Republican senators” who are “trying to get things done” on immigration and other issues. But he ripped into “a faction of Republicans in the House” who he said would not give the Senate immigration bill a vote and “gutted a farm bill that America’s farmers and most vulnerable children depend on.”

And he went straight at the House Republicans over raising the debt ceiling and funding the government — two issues that will dominate Washington debate this fall.

“We’ve seen a sizable group of Republican lawmakers suggest they wouldn’t vote to pay the very bills that Congress rang up — a fiasco that harmed a fragile recovery in 2011, and one we can’t afford to repeat,” Obama said.

The risk to this approach, which Obama has embraced repeatedly in the past to limited effect, is that it drives House Republicans crazy and makes it harder to seal deals on issues like the debt ceiling and funding the government.

Republicans on Wednesday showed no signs of warming up to the president’s positions. And they were clearly angered by his dismissive tone. “The IRS’s targeting of Americans because of their political beliefs is not a ‘phony’ scandal,” House Majority Leader Eric Cantor tweeted during the speech.

Some Democratic officials suggested prior to the address that Obama would try to aim high and avoid Washington-speak like “sequester.” But he specifically invoked the sequester spending cuts and accused Republicans of taking a “meat cleaver” to the budget rather than using a scalpel.

But West added that the speech would probably succeed in “putting Obama out front on the economy at a moment when Republicans have no standard-bearer and Congress is gearing up for recess.”

2. How bullish will he be on the economy?

Moderately so.

One of the risks going into the speech was that Obama would appear to be cheerleading a recovery that most average Americans are barely feeling as wages stagnate, good jobs remain elusive and many workers have simply given up looking.

Obama, as expected, did take some credit for “rescuing” the auto industry — even as the city of Detroit has filed for bankruptcy — and turning massive jobs losses into steady job gains.

“Add it all up, and over the past 40 months, our businesses have created 7.2 million new jobs. This year, we are off to our strongest private-sector job growth since 1999,” Obama said. “As a country, we’ve recovered faster and gone further than most other advanced nations in the world.”

But Obama quickly pivoted to acknowledge that almost every economic indicator, from wages to unemployment, are still much worse than when he spoke at Knox College in 2005. “I’m here today to tell you what you already know — we’re not there yet,” Obama said.

Camarota, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Mairead Mcardle, John Mccormack, Carrie Severino, John Fund, Tobias Hoonhout, Rich Lowry, Bill Corsair, Andrew C. Mccarthy","Immigrants at a naturalization ceremony in Los Angeles in 2018 . ( Lucy Nicholson/Reuters )
We hear it all the time . During the recent primary debate , Joe Biden said illegal immigrants “ increased the lifespan of Social Security. ” America must have large numbers of immigrants to “ rebuild the demographic pyramid , ” in the words of Jeb Bush .
To be sure , Americans have had small families for quite some time , and life expediency has increased . Our population is aging . But there is a significant amount of research on how much immigration can offset population aging in low-fertility countries such as the United States , and the answer is clear — not much .
In a 1992 article in Demography , economist Carl Schmertmann explained that , mathematically , “ Constant inflows of immigrants , even at relatively young ages , do not necessarily rejuvenate low-fertility populations . In fact , immigration may even contribute to population aging. ” After reviewing population projections , the former chair of Princeton ’ s sociology department and the director of its graduate population-studies program , Thomas Espenshade , observed :
It becomes apparent that the effect of alternative immigration levels on population age structure is small , unless we are willing to entertain a volume of U.S. immigration of historic proportion . . . . Immigration is a clumsy and unrealistic policy alternative to offset a shortage of domestic labor or to correct a perceived imbalance in the pensioner/worker ratio in the United States .
After looking at all the population projections prepared by the United Nations , Oxford demographer David Coleman has concluded , “ There are no feasible migration solutions to the age-structure change and its effects on social security. ” Coleman and others have pointed out that immigration can prevent population decline — that is , it can add a lot of people to the country — but it does not significantly change the age structure in the way that many immigration advocates seem to imagine . If we wanted to use immigration to offset population aging , the level necessary would have to be truly enormous .
A recent paper I coauthored based on the most recent Census Bureau population projections examined the impact of immigration on the nation ’ s age structure . Assuming current levels of immigration continue , the latest projections indicate that the total U.S. population will reach 404 million in 2060 — 79 million larger than in 2017 . Future immigrants and their descendants account for nearly all ( 75 million ) of the increase . Under this scenario , 59 percent of the population will be working-age ( 16 to 64 ) . By contrast , in a zero-immigration scenario , 57 percent of the population would be working-age in 2060 . More realistically , if immigration were limited to half of the expected level , 58 percent would be working age .
Part of the reason immigration has such a modest impact on the working-age population is that , while it certainly adds a lot of new workers , it also adds children and retirees over time . Most people will recognize why a larger senior population increases government expenditures , but a larger child population does as well . The United States spent $ 668 billion just on public schools in the 2016–2017 school year .
Of course , the children of immigrants eventually grow up and become workers , but by the time this happens , a significant share of their immigrant parents will have reached retirement age . These two trends tend to offset each other over time . As a result , immigration does not have much of an impact on the share of the population that is working-age . Even if we exclude children from the analysis and focus only on the ratio of working-age people to retirees ( age 65-plus ) , the impact of immigration is still modest . There will be 2.5 working-age people per retiree in 2060 if immigration unfolds as the Census Bureau projects ; there will be 2.3 workers per retiree if immigration is cut in half . The impact , while not trivial , is modest .
In fact , it is likely that the current Census Bureau projections , on which our analysis is based , overstate the impact of immigration on aging . In a new paper authored by myself and Karen Ziegler , we find that immigrants are coming to America at much older ages than in the recent past . The Census Bureau ’ s projections do not fully reflect this change . The average age of newly arrived legal and illegal immigrants has increased from 26 in 2000 to 31 in 2017 . The share of newly arrived immigrants who are 55 or older doubled from 5 percent to 12 percent . In other words , about one in eight new immigrants are now arriving in America old enough to move directly into a retirement community .
Several factors likely explain the rising age of new arrivals . Fertility is declining and life expectancy is increasing all over the world . Older populations in sending regions translates into older immigrants coming here , at least to some extent . Equally important , under current law any citizen can sponsor a parent , and there are no numerical limits on this immigration category . In the last three decades 1 million people per year were given green cards — permanent residence — which allows for citizenship after five years . As a result , the population of naturalized citizens has roughly doubled in the last two decades , and so has the number of people entering in the parent category . The significant increase in the age at which immigrants arrive makes it likely that the Census Bureau projections overstate the modest impact of immigration on population aging .
What would it take to use immigration to prevent population aging ? Our analysis shows it would take a fivefold increase in immigration levels over what the Census Bureau foresees to maintain the working-age share and ratio of workers to retirees . This would create a total population of 706 million in 2060 — more than double the current population . Most U.S. residents would be post-2017 immigrants or their offspring . Of course , immigration at this level would profoundly affect the culture , politics , and social fabric of the United States in dramatic and perhaps unforeseeable ways .
So what is the solution to an aging society ? Commenting on our population study at a panel discussion in March of this year , American Enterprise Institute demographer Nicholas Eberstadt put it succinctly : “ Immigration can not possibly over the long run maintain a youthful population structure. ” He added that “ raising the age of retirement has a bigger bang. ” David Coleman makes much the same point in his analysis . Increasing the retirement age by two years has about the same impact on the working-age share or ratio of workers to retirees in 2060 as does the immigration-induced addition of 75 million people projected by the Census Bureau . If the retirement age were increased to 70 it would nearly maintain today ’ s working-age share of the population through 2060 . This change certainly would take some getting used to , but it seems far less disruptive to society than adding hundreds of millions of people .
Another way to deal with the decline in the working-age population is to increase the employment rate . At present , the employment rate for those 16 to 64 is about 70 percent , which is low by historic standards . Bumping the working-age employment rate up to 75 percent would do more to change the share of the population working than 75 million immigrants and their progeny would . It is not unrealistic to raise the employment rate , as it was 74 percent as recently as 2000 .
One could favor liberal immigration policies for many reasons , but it is no fix for an aging society . We will have to look elsewhere to deal with the challenges associated with population aging . Raising the retirement age and getting more working-age people back to work are much more efficient in dealing with the issue .","Immigrants at a naturalization ceremony in Los Angeles in 2018.

In a 1992 article in Demography, economist Carl Schmertmann explained that, mathematically, “Constant inflows of immigrants, even at relatively young ages, do not necessarily rejuvenate low-fertility populations. In fact, immigration may even contribute to population aging.” After reviewing population projections, the former chair of Princeton’s sociology department and the director of its graduate population-studies program, Thomas Espenshade, observed:

It becomes apparent that the effect of alternative immigration levels on population age structure is small, unless we are willing to entertain a volume of U.S. immigration of historic proportion. . . . Immigration is a clumsy and unrealistic policy alternative to offset a shortage of domestic labor or to correct a perceived imbalance in the pensioner/worker ratio in the United States.

After looking at all the population projections prepared by the United Nations, Oxford demographer David Coleman has concluded, “There are no feasible migration solutions to the age-structure change and its effects on social security.” Coleman and others have pointed out that immigration can prevent population decline — that is, it can add a lot of people to the country — but it does not significantly change the age structure in the way that many immigration advocates seem to imagine. If we wanted to use immigration to offset population aging, the level necessary would have to be truly enormous.

A recent paper I coauthored based on the most recent Census Bureau population projections examined the impact of immigration on the nation’s age structure. Assuming current levels of immigration continue, the latest projections indicate that the total U.S. population will reach 404 million in 2060 — 79 million larger than in 2017. Future immigrants and their descendants account for nearly all (75 million) of the increase. Under this scenario, 59 percent of the population will be working-age (16 to 64). By contrast, in a zero-immigration scenario, 57 percent of the population would be working-age in 2060. More realistically, if immigration were limited to half of the expected level, 58 percent would be working age.

Part of the reason immigration has such a modest impact on the working-age population is that, while it certainly adds a lot of new workers, it also adds children and retirees over time. Most people will recognize why a larger senior population increases government expenditures, but a larger child population does as well. The United States spent $668 billion just on public schools in the 2016–2017 school year.

Of course, the children of immigrants eventually grow up and become workers, but by the time this happens, a significant share of their immigrant parents will have reached retirement age. These two trends tend to offset each other over time. As a result, immigration does not have much of an impact on the share of the population that is working-age. Even if we exclude children from the analysis and focus only on the ratio of working-age people to retirees (age 65-plus), the impact of immigration is still modest. There will be 2.5 working-age people per retiree in 2060 if immigration unfolds as the Census Bureau projects; there will be 2.3 workers per retiree if immigration is cut in half. The impact, while not trivial, is modest.

In fact, it is likely that the current Census Bureau projections, on which our analysis is based, overstate the impact of immigration on aging. In a new paper authored by myself and Karen Ziegler, we find that immigrants are coming to America at much older ages than in the recent past. The Census Bureau’s projections do not fully reflect this change. The average age of newly arrived legal and illegal immigrants has increased from 26 in 2000 to 31 in 2017. The share of newly arrived immigrants who are 55 or older doubled from 5 percent to 12 percent. In other words, about one in eight new immigrants are now arriving in America old enough to move directly into a retirement community.

Several factors likely explain the rising age of new arrivals. Fertility is declining and life expectancy is increasing all over the world. Older populations in sending regions translates into older immigrants coming here, at least to some extent. Equally important, under current law any citizen can sponsor a parent, and there are no numerical limits on this immigration category. In the last three decades 1 million people per year were given green cards — permanent residence — which allows for citizenship after five years. As a result, the population of naturalized citizens has roughly doubled in the last two decades, and so has the number of people entering in the parent category. The significant increase in the age at which immigrants arrive makes it likely that the Census Bureau projections overstate the modest impact of immigration on population aging.

What would it take to use immigration to prevent population aging? Our analysis shows it would take a fivefold increase in immigration levels over what the Census Bureau foresees to maintain the working-age share and ratio of workers to retirees. This would create a total population of 706 million in 2060 — more than double the current population. Most U.S. residents would be post-2017 immigrants or their offspring. Of course, immigration at this level would profoundly affect the culture, politics, and social fabric of the United States in dramatic and perhaps unforeseeable ways.

So what is the solution to an aging society? Commenting on our population study at a panel discussion in March of this year, American Enterprise Institute demographer Nicholas Eberstadt put it succinctly: “Immigration cannot possibly over the long run maintain a youthful population structure.” He added that “raising the age of retirement has a bigger bang.” David Coleman makes much the same point in his analysis. Increasing the retirement age by two years has about the same impact on the working-age share or ratio of workers to retirees in 2060 as does the immigration-induced addition of 75 million people projected by the Census Bureau. If the retirement age were increased to 70 it would nearly maintain today’s working-age share of the population through 2060. This change certainly would take some getting used to, but it seems far less disruptive to society than adding hundreds of millions of people.

Another way to deal with the decline in the working-age population is to increase the employment rate. At present, the employment rate for those 16 to 64 is about 70 percent, which is low by historic standards. Bumping the working-age employment rate up to 75 percent would do more to change the share of the population working than 75 million immigrants and their progeny would. It is not unrealistic to raise the employment rate, as it was 74 percent as recently as 2000.

One could favor liberal immigration policies for many reasons, but it is no fix for an aging society. We will have to look elsewhere to deal with the challenges associated with population aging. Raising the retirement age and getting more working-age people back to work are much more efficient in dealing with the issue.",www.nationalreview.com,right,UXRvX27clzOd98Sp

IN THE NEWS: ‘Democrats Like Socialism More than Capitalism’",www.nationalreview.com,right,cSr2o3XCzd0hMw8A
economic_policy,Vox,0,http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/4/21/15386602/trump-executive-order-finance, Today’s executive orders are the nail in the coffin of Trump’s economic populism,2017-04-21,"Matthew Yglesias, Theodore Schleifer, Li Zhou, Sean Collins, Umair Irfan, Jen Kirby, Alex Abad-Santos","Friday afternoon , Donald Trump traveled to the US Treasury Department where he ’ s expected to sign a new executive order . The order aims at making life easier for American companies that want to avoid corporate income taxes , relax regulation on some large financial institutions , and make it harder for federal regulators to wind down big banks that fail during a financial crisis .
It ’ s all part of the Trump administration ’ s frenetic sprint to put some points on the board ahead of the symbolically significant 100 days mark , though it also certainly seems like a betrayal of the populist themes of his campaign . The good or bad news , depending on how you feel , is that , based on briefings provided in advance by the White House , it does not appear that today ’ s order actually does anything per se .
Instead , he is essentially issuing a press release announcing his intention to begin the process of potentially undoing the regulations . As with his earlier executive order on climate regulation , this push for bank deregulation is significant as a statement of priorities and certainly could lead to meaningful policy change down the road but will have little immediate impact .
But the broader significance of Trump ’ s executive sort-of order is as a statement of priorities — a clear flashing light that the notion of a Trump-era GOP as an economically populist “ workers ’ party ” is dead , and business interests rule the roost .
The executive order targets three separate Obama-era rules relating to financial services :
One is rules from the Treasury Department announced about a year ago that make it harder for American companies to engage in “ tax inversions ” whereby they legally become foreign companies , while retaining their US headquarters and operations , in order to avoid US corporate income tax .
Another is provisions of the Dodd-Frank bank regulation law that allow the Financial Stability Oversight Council to designate non-bank financial institutions ( insurance companies , say ) as “ systemically significant ” and thus subject to unusually tight regulatory scrutiny .
Last , there is a key Dodd-Frank provision known as Orderly Liquidation Authority which gives the FDIC power to keep a complicated failed bank running just long enough to euthanize it piece-by-piece without sparking a massive financial crisis .
Trump ’ s order does not rescind any of these rules . It merely orders a “ review ” of them . The federal rule-making process is time-consuming and subject to litigation and judicial review , so Trump can ’ t simply waive Obama-era rules away . He can , however , implicitly gut regulation through neglect .
In the case of the tax rules , the Trump administration could directly lead to the rule being reversed through executive action if they take the time to go through the steps . In the case of the Dodd-Frank provisions , some modification could be made to the existing procedures through the executive branch alone . But formally eliminating these provisions would probably require new legislation .
As Mike Konczal explained for ███ , Orderly Liquidation Authority could be eliminated through the budget reconciliation process . OLA is structured to cost money in the short-term ( because the FDIC needs to keep the dead bank open ) .

The order aims at making life easier for American companies that want to avoid corporate income taxes, relax regulation on some large financial institutions, and make it harder for federal regulators to wind down big banks that fail during a financial crisis.

It’s all part of the Trump administration’s frenetic sprint to put some points on the board ahead of the symbolically significant 100 days mark, though it also certainly seems like a betrayal of the populist themes of his campaign. The good or bad news, depending on how you feel, is that, based on briefings provided in advance by the White House, it does not appear that today’s order actually does anything per se.

Instead, he is essentially issuing a press release announcing his intention to begin the process of potentially undoing the regulations. As with his earlier executive order on climate regulation, this push for bank deregulation is significant as a statement of priorities and certainly could lead to meaningful policy change down the road but will have little immediate impact.

But the broader significance of Trump’s executive sort-of order is as a statement of priorities — a clear flashing light that the notion of a Trump-era GOP as an economically populist “workers’ party” is dead, and business interests rule the roost.

What Trump’s order would do, if it did anything

The executive order targets three separate Obama-era rules relating to financial services:

One is rules from the Treasury Department announced about a year ago that make it harder for American companies to engage in “tax inversions” whereby they legally become foreign companies, while retaining their US headquarters and operations, in order to avoid US corporate income tax.

Another is provisions of the Dodd-Frank bank regulation law that allow the Financial Stability Oversight Council to designate non-bank financial institutions (insurance companies, say) as “systemically significant” and thus subject to unusually tight regulatory scrutiny.

Last, there is a key Dodd-Frank provision known as Orderly Liquidation Authority which gives the FDIC power to keep a complicated failed bank running just long enough to euthanize it piece-by-piece without sparking a massive financial crisis.

Trump’s order does not rescind any of these rules. It merely orders a “review” of them. The federal rule-making process is time-consuming and subject to litigation and judicial review, so Trump can’t simply waive Obama-era rules away. He can, however, implicitly gut regulation through neglect.

In the case of the tax rules, the Trump administration could directly lead to the rule being reversed through executive action if they take the time to go through the steps. In the case of the Dodd-Frank provisions, some modification could be made to the existing procedures through the executive branch alone. But formally eliminating these provisions would probably require new legislation.

As Mike Konczal explained for Vox, Orderly Liquidation Authority could be eliminated through the budget reconciliation process. OLA is structured to cost money in the short-term (because the FDIC needs to keep the dead bank open). Dodd-Frank’s authors in Congress and the Obama Treasury Department argue that the fiscal cost of running down a failed bank in an organized way is minor compared to the real world impact of having the Treasury Secretary chaotically run to Congress demanding emergency bailout money.

But for the purposes of congressional procedure, if not real-world economic policy, Congress can pretend that there will be no bailouts in the event of a crisis and then just pony up the bailout money with no strings attached when crisis strikes.

Economic populist Trump is dead

Paired with the Trump-era surge in immigration arrests, potential deportation of a DREAMer, and broad attacks on judicial review, the financial services executive order is meaningful primarily for clarifying what the exact meaning of the rising clout of “globalists” inside the White House is.

National Economic Council Chair Gary Cohn comes to the White House from a job as the number two official at Goldman Sachs. His version of globalism isn’t the high-minded humane cosmopolitanism that would, say, forestall massive cuts in the foreign aid budget or militate in favor of generous treatment of Central American families seeking refuge from gang violence. It’s the globalism of Goldman Sachs, which wants light-touch regulation of the financial sector, plenty of room for multinational corporations to engage in tax chicanery, and no major trade wars that would threaten US-based financial services companies’ abilities to compete for market share internationally.

A little protectionism here and there for the steel industry is fine as long as things don’t get out of hand.

But there’s no real economic populism here. Trump’s alternative to technocratic liberal bank regulation is bank regulation pursued in the interests of the banking industry. Formally repealing bank rules through legislation will be difficult, and even rolling back regulations through executive action could be hard.

In a fiery speech that sharply criticized her opponent ’ s economic vision for the US , Hillary Clinton said Donald Trump ’ s proposals will only benefit the rich , while destroying the economy in tandem .
Speaking before hundreds of union workers and supporters on Thursday , Clinton positioned her plan as a boon for the middle class , with a pledge to curry support in Congress for the largest investment in “ good-paying jobs ” since the second world war by rebuilding infrastructure across the nation .
“ We will put Americans to work , building and modernizing our roads , our bridges , our tunnels , our railways , our ports , our airports , ” she said . “ We are way overdue for this , my friends . We are living off the investments that were made by our parents ’ and grandparents ’ generations . ”
Trump ’ s plan , by contrast , doesn ’ t offer any “ credible solutions to the very real economic challenges we face ” , she said .
“ He would give trillions in tax cuts to corporations … that would explode our national debt and eventually lead to massive cuts in priorities like education , healthcare and environmental protection , ” Clinton said .
Clinton ’ s campaign said her plan would add more than 10m jobs across the US . It would include employment opportunities for outgoing prison inmates and youth , as well as billions of dollars for infrastructure projects . Despite embracing a more upbeat view of the nation ’ s outlook compared to her opponent , Clinton noted that income inequality has continued to increase in recent years .
“ It is just too hard to get ahead today , ” she said . “ But there are commonsense things that your government can do that would give Americans more opportunities to succeed . Why don ’ t we do it ? Because powerful special interests and the tendency to put ideology ahead of political progress have led to gridlock in Congress . ”
Clinton ’ s 50-minute speech in south-east Michigan followed an economic policy rollout on Monday by her opponent – whose remarks in Detroit were interrupted more than a dozen times by protesters . Trump ’ s subdued speech ( by his standards ) took repeated shots at Clinton , in particular by saying her “ failed ” economic agenda is indicative of problems in Detroit , which emerged from municipal bankruptcy just under two years ago .
The former secretary of state vehemently pushed back against Trump on Thursday , saying his plan is a rehashed playbook of trickle-down economics , and will only benefit millionaires and billionaires . In particular , she dubbed one aspect of her opponent ’ s plan as the “ Trump loophole ” : a proposal to slash income taxes for corporations by more than half .
“ It would allow him to pay less than half the current tax rate in income for many of his companies , ” she said . “ He ’ d pay a lower rate than millions of middle class families. ” One analyst , she noted , said Trump ’ s plan would be a “ really nice deal – for Donald Trump ” .
Trump ’ s proposal to eliminate the estate tax , which applies to estates larger than $ 5.45m for individuals , would also shore up his family ’ s finances , Clinton said .
“ That alone would save the Trump family $ 4bn , ” she claimed . “ It would do nothing for 99.8 % of Americans . So they ’ d get a $ 4bn tax cut , and 99.8 % of Americans would get nothing . Just think of what we could do with those four billion . ”

Washington is done dwelling on the debt.

Fatigued by a government shutdown and repeated failures to reach a grand bargain, leaders from both parties have moved on.

Story Continued Below

President Barack Obama isn’t expected to spend much time on deficit reduction and entitlement reform during Tuesday’s State of the Union address, instead focusing on issues such as economic inequality and raising the minimum wage that will be the centerpiece of his 2014 agenda.

Republicans don’t want to divert attention from Obamacare and plan to demand changes in the health care law, not spending cuts, in exchange for a debt-limit increase next month. They dismiss grand bargain talks with Obama as fruitless.

For Obama, the shifting political landscape is a chance to move past an issue that some Democrats see as a political loser headed into the midterms — the president even complained to Senate Democrats this month that he doesn’t get enough credit for previous deficit cuts.

Republicans see an opportunity to redefine themselves as a party that has an agenda beyond budget cuts. They say they will now focus on “kitchen-table” issues like increasing take-home pay, creating new incentives for school vouchers and charter schools, and some form of immigration reform.

Not that the $17 trillion debt is going away anytime soon. The debt as a share of the economy is projected to decline over the next few years, and the deficit has dropped at the fastest rate since World War II — a point that Obama repeats often these days. The brightened outlook will last only a few years before an aging population and rising health care costs force deficits to balloon over the next decade. But the temporary cease-fire in the budget wars and an improvement in the fiscal picture have diminished any lingering sense of urgency for Washington to act on a large-scale deal.

That means there won’t be renewed efforts to tackle the real drivers of the debt until next year at the earliest, but likely not until after the 2016 presidential election.

“Neither party wants to talk about it,” said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. “This is the first time we have been staring into the political horizon and there is no action-forcing moment.”

House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), whose ascension in 2011 was fueled by small-government conservative activists, has all but ruled out any further deficit reduction talks with Obama because they can’t move past a basic disagreement on taxes. They also insist Obama has shifted his demands too often.

In next month’s fight to raise the debt ceiling, Boehner is not expected to renew his demand to cut spending by an equal amount — a principle that pushed Obama into extended, unsuccessful talks with the speaker in 2011. Instead, Republicans are zeroing in on Obamacare, and are likely to insist on some kind of fix in exchange for increasing the country’s borrowing authority.

White House aides said Obama stands by his last offer to Boehner in December 2012, which included Medicare cuts that infuriated Democrats.

That improvement in our deficit picture means we have more room to put in place, in a fiscally responsible way, policies that will expand opportunity for all Americans.”

For Democratic lawmakers, many of whom never bought into Obama’s focus on debt and deficit reduction, the move away from austerity couldn’t have come soon enough.

“It is amazing how it has faded as an issue except among a small group,” said Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), the No. 3 leader. “The reason is, first, we have made big progress and, second, it has become apparent that it is not on the average person’s mind.”

Obama moves on

Obama’s rhetoric over the past year underscores the shift.

The president gave the budget top billing in last year’s State of the Union address, turning to it immediately after detailing the general themes of the speech. The White House and Congress had agreed to $2.5 trillion in spending cuts and tax hikes over the past few years, he told lawmakers, putting them more than halfway toward the goal of $4 trillion to stabilize the country’s finances.

“Now we need to finish the job. And the question is, how?” Obama said as he renewed calls for tax and entitlement reform.

Although he pushed for a repeal of across-the-board spending cuts known as the sequester, they kicked in last March, locking in budget savings that allowed Obama to tout several months later that the deficit was on a rapid decline.

That ’ s a shame , contends economist John Schmitt , and it ’ s bad for policymaking as well as politics . Schmitt , a senior economist at the progressive Center for Economic and Policy Research , spoke with ███ about the problem with emphasizing economic mobility , the limits of attacking inequality through education , and what Obama should say – but won ’ t – tonight . A condensed version of our conversation follows .
A “ senior administration official ” told the Wall Street Journal that , in the Journal ’ s words , “ income inequality would be addressed ” in the speech , “ but would be just one piece of the broader challenge to increase opportunities. ” What is at stake in this question of whether the challenge is economic mobility , or the question is inequality ?
Obviously , both are very important and they ’ re highly interrelated …
An important issue whenever people talk about opportunity and mobility is to keep in mind that if we ’ re talking about … starting to change it today , we ’ re talking about having an impact on mobility or opportunity , and ultimately on inequality , that is for most purposes possibly decades away . So you know , I think the time frame that we see results is going to be a lot different depending on whether we focus on trying to address inequality in the present or trying to address economic opportunity and economic mobility for basically young people today when they ’ re 40 and 60 , not 20 …
If your strategy is to get people to go to college , finish college and get college-educated jobs , you ’ re basically leaving that group of workers that are , say , 25 and older , that are unlikely to go back to college and finish – I mean , some will and some do , but not in large numbers – you know , you ’ re leaving them out to dry . And you ’ re basically saying we ’ re going to solve inequality by slowly increasing the share of the workforce that has a college degree … It ’ s a very , very slow way to address the economic inequality question . It will work to a certain degree , but it takes a very long time . And … the thing that economists don ’ t say is : … How is it that making more people have a college degree is going to reduce inequality ? Well , one important reason is that it ’ s going to lower the wages of recent college graduates , and bring them back down , because there ’ s going to be an increase in supply …
We have a pressing economic inequality problem right now . And we know how to address that . It ’ s just that making the politics happen is what the obstacle is . It ’ s a shame that there ’ s a shift away from directly the issue of inequality , to … questions like mobility and opportunity . Because I think those are much harder to pin down , they ’ re a much longer time frame , and they take us away from the direct kinds of issues that have an immediate impact .
In the State of the Union last year , the president said , “ to grow our middle class , our citizens have to have access to the education and training that today ’ s jobs require. ” This is something you hear a lot , from Democrats and from Republicans . How much of an answer is that to the mobility problem , or the inequality problem ?
The focus on training , on education , on skills -- those are things that are extremely helpful , and they ’ re very useful in the medium- and long-term … But that ’ s not the problem that we have right now .
The problem that we have right now is not that there are tons [ of jobs ] out there going vacant because we don ’ t have the workforce that can fill those jobs . We have the exact opposite problem . We have something on the order of three unemployed people for every vacancy that ’ s available . And we have a situation where even highly skilled workers are having trouble finding work … We have recent college graduates working for free as interns , and struggling to find a job that ’ s not something that they could ’ ve done with just a high school degree …
The [ supposed ] skills shortage problem … If there ’ s not enough workers who have particular skills , then employers start to bid , to get the workers that do have those skills . They steal them away from their competitors , and they bid the wages up . That ’ s not happening anywhere in the economy right now . So it makes me deeply skeptical that the problems that we face are related to skills . And it makes me deeply skeptical that we ’ re going to solve those problems in the short-term by increasing training and education – as much as I might favor doing those things .
Your “ Where Have All the Good Jobs Gone ” research – what does that suggest about the limits of education and productivity as ways for workers broadly to make it into the “ middle class , ” so to speak , or as solutions to these problems ?
Workers today are a lot older than they were in the 1960s or the 1970s , and they are enormously better-educated than they were in the 1960s or 1970s . The fact that most workers are doing barely better , and some workers are doing worse than their counterparts from 40 or 50 years ago … suggest that the problem is that the way the economy converts people 's skills , people ’ s experience , people ’ s education and their training , into good jobs is what has deteriorated over this period . Not people ’ s underlying skills , or work experience , or education .
And I think it points to something completely different -- and I think it ’ s absent from a lot of the discussion as [ to ] the reasons why we have economic inequality , and the reasons why we have these continuous problems with mobility and opportunity . And that has to do with bargaining power of workers . And you know , that I think is a piece that ’ s unfortunately missing from the president ’ s discussion of economic inequality , and it ’ s absent from his discussion of mobility and opportunity .
The way the economy has been restructured over the last three or four decades has removed the bargaining power of workers at the middle and the bottom . And it ’ s done that in a very systematic way .
The president ’ s rightly focused on the question of the minimum wage because I think it ’ s kind of a core example of where we ’ ve used public policy in a way to reduce the bargaining power of workers at the bottom . Because we ’ ve just allowed the minimum wage to fall far below its historic value , no matter how you measure it . … It ’ s definitely below where it was four or five decades ago , even though we ’ re much richer than we used to be . That ’ s a conscious or semi-conscious decision that we ’ ve made …
That ’ s just one example . Another is this big decline in unionization in the private sector that we ’ ve seen over the last four or five decades … We have a labor law that is completely unresponsive to workers ’ desires to form a union in the private sector … That undermines the power very much of workers , in particular in the middle of the wage distribution …
We pretty regularly keep the unemployment rate too high , much higher than even economists , who are pretty conservative about these things , think is the level of full employment . And that goes directly to workers ’ bargaining power … If you have a job and the unemployment rate is 10 percent , you are much less likely to go to your employer and ask for a pay increase , or improvement in benefits , or a better schedule , than if the unemployment rate is 4 percent …
We have this kind of systematic setup where the minimum wage is down , unions are down , the unemployment rate is too high .
It doesn ’ t stop there … Immigrant workers have almost no rights under our labor law … Because their position is so weak , it undermines the power of low-wage workers who were born here and have -- barely -- more rights … It creates a perfect set of circumstances for low-wage employers , because they can play immigrant workers against U.S.-born workers , in an environment where neither of them has very many rights . So businesses don ’ t have a big incentive to try and fix that situation …
We ’ ve had trade deals such as [ the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership ] , which we ’ re discussing right now , which are basically organized to increase the power , economic power of corporations , and to undermine the power of their workers and consumers .
You know , we privatized state and local government functions at quite an alarming rate … The main advantage that the private sector has over the public sector is not that they ’ re more efficient at organizing school buses . It ’ s that they pay their workers less and they don ’ t give them benefits …
That discussion of bargaining power , and the politics and the policies around it , is firstly what ’ s going to be missing from the State of the Union address . And broadly from the discussion of economic inequality . From , you know , even the Democratic Party , for the most part .
Alan Kreuger ’ s Gatsby curve [ tying inequality to mobility ] – what do you make of that contention , and how should that inform these debates about income inequality and mobility ?
To me , the most important single conclusion to draw from the Gatsby curve is just that the United States has both very high levels of economic inequality , and very low levels of mobility . The rest of the debate and discussion around the curve is whether or not one causes the other -- and then there ’ s a separate question of whether or not the level of mobility has been falling relative to the past …
One of the arguments I think that you sometimes hear is that … it doesn ’ t matter if economic inequality increases , because we have lots of economic mobility in the United States . And I think that what the data that Alan Krueger and many others have shown is that the United States actually has low levels of economic mobility relative to almost every other country that looks like us in terms of standard of living .
And so you can ’ t take a lot of comfort from the prospects of economic mobility … even if it ’ s the case that economic mobility is exactly the same as it was 20 or 30 years ago , that ’ s small comfort for somebody born into the economy today . Because the penalty for not moving up is , we know , substantially higher than it used to be … the 20th and the 50th percentile have , you know , basically both fallen relative to the top … If we had a big increase in economic inequality , at least to stay where we were , we would need to have a big increase in mobility -- which we certainly have not had .
But my own view is , you know , the mobility question is important , and opportunity is important -- but it ’ s also the case that we want to make sure that workers at the 10th percentile … or a low-income family at the 20th percentile , that those folks move with the growth in the overall economy . And that is something that simply has not happened over the last four decades or so …
People ’ s resources , particularly when kids are young , are going to make a big difference to where their kids end up . And if we focus on inequality in the short term , we are going to have an impact on mobility in the medium and the long term . And that ’ s what we see in the examples of other countries : The other countries that tend to have more mobility than we do have … a lot more equality , and more resources available to children in particular .
In England , the attitude of “ New Labor ” was once characterized [ in 1998 ] by [ Blair cabinet member ] Peter Mendelson saying he was “ intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich , as long as they pay their taxes. ” What do you make of that worldview … that it doesn ’ t hurt people at the bottom to have extremes at the top , as long as you then tax the money ?
Even since he made those comments … I think there ’ s been a much better consciousness of the broader social costs of inequality . It ’ s very divisive . It creates a lot of political problems . It ’ s not just , you know , some sideshow . I mean , it ’ s a real core issue about fairness , and how people understand and identify with their society …
The other truth is that we don ’ t actually tax the money away . One of the big problems that we have is that we don ’ t have tax rates that actually … take back a significant chunk of what people at the very top make … Hedge fund managers pay a tax rate of 15 percent ... No low-wage worker in the United States probably pays less than that , when you add in all the different taxes they have to pay …
There ’ s a big cost to the way we have things organized , because there ’ s a lot of oneupmanship in the CEO world , and there ’ s a lot of competition to get paid a little bit more … If we had taxes that made it less important to make the extra million dollars , because you knew you were going to get 90 percent of it taxed away , people might focus on other things , and do other stuff …
A lot of very , very highly paid people get `` [ economic ] rents '' -- they get [ paid ] money they don ’ t need to [ be paid ] in order to [ be willing to ] do their jobs . So from a societal point of view , we ’ re paying the top 1 percent enormously more money than we need to in order to get them to do whatever job it is that they do , whatever socially valuable function that they think that they have …
I ’ m pretty sure that Bill Gates would have probably done everything that he did for , I ’ m just going to say , $ 50 million … Maybe I ’ m terribly , terribly wrong , and he would have only done what he did for $ 5 billion . But the point is that as a society , we ’ ve given him $ 50 billion , essentially . We ’ ve arranged a market system that has awarded him with $ 50 billion or more …
From a societal point of view , that ’ s an enormous waste . Because we could have gotten all the good products and services from all of the work that consumers value from Microsoft , by giving Bill Gates $ 45 billion less than we did . We would have all sorts of resources to invest in all sorts of other things , and we didn ’ t do that . So it ’ s a real case of inefficiency .
What would be the dream State of the Union speech on these issues ?
One that recognizes the political constraints that are operating on the president and on progressive forces … but would spell out an alternative story to why we ’ re in the mess we ’ re in , and an alternative set of solutions …
Instead of focusing on how kind of abstract forces of technology , and you know , abstract forces of globalization are dragging down the American workforce , and creating all sorts of inequality , it would focus instead on how , you know , very clear politics , and very clear policy decisions are undermining the bargaining power of workers at the middle and the bottom .
And that is the cause of economic inequality . And that the solutions involve restructuring the economy in ways that give power to workers at the middle and the bottom …
It tells us a different story about why we ’ re in the circumstances we ’ re in , and gives us a set of recipes that are focused on the present , and on dealing with economic inequality in the present , as a way toward improving economic mobility and economic opportunity . Rather than offering us , you know , the opportunity to change things 15 or 20 years down the line if all goes well .","Following prior pieces suggesting “income inequality” would be the centerpiece of tonight’s State of the Union, multiple outlets are reporting that’s not quite the case. “Income inequality is out,” wrote the Associated Press, “‘ladders of opportunity’ is in.”

Because we could have gotten all the good products and services from all of the work that consumers value from Microsoft, by giving Bill Gates $45 billion less than we did. We would have all sorts of resources to invest in all sorts of other things, and we didn’t do that. So it’s a real case of inefficiency.

What would be the dream State of the Union speech on these issues?

One that recognizes the political constraints that are operating on the president and on progressive forces … but would spell out an alternative story to why we’re in the mess we’re in, and an alternative set of solutions …

Instead of focusing on how kind of abstract forces of technology, and you know, abstract forces of globalization are dragging down the American workforce, and creating all sorts of inequality, it would focus instead on how, you know, very clear politics, and very clear policy decisions are undermining the bargaining power of workers at the middle and the bottom.

And that is the cause of economic inequality. And that the solutions involve restructuring the economy in ways that give power to workers at the middle and the bottom …

It tells us a different story about why we’re in the circumstances we’re in, and gives us a set of recipes that are focused on the present, and on dealing with economic inequality in the present, as a way toward improving economic mobility and economic opportunity. Rather than offering us, you know, the opportunity to change things 15 or 20 years down the line if all goes well.",www.salon.com,left,QaVIVuZS4tCZJ1EF

Can the U.S. “Afford” Not to Raise Taxes?

As to whether the nation can afford not to raise taxes on the wealthiest 2 percent, consider that according to his budget, Obama’s proposal to raise taxes on individuals with incomes more than $250,000 would generate $835.6 billion over 10 years if one ignores the damage done to the economy in the process.

Expressed another way, allowing some of the Bush tax cuts to expire as Obama demands represents less than 10 percent of the projected debt increase.

More recently, President Obama has upped the ante significantly, first to $1.4 trillion and then to $1.6 trillion in higher taxes. These numbers do not come out of thin air.

Two observations are immediately apparent. First, Obama is no longer talking about allowing tax cuts to expire. These are all new tax hikes. Second, even after doubling the amount of tax hike, the national debt still goes up by about $7 trillion over the next 10 years.

The only possible conclusion is that the revenues from Obama’s tax-hike demand—either his original demand or the double-up—barely dent today’s deficit or the projected increase in the debt. Obama’s revenue demands express his vision of social justice, not an economic policy or even a budget policy. To address the deficit, Obama should focus on the problem: an excess of spending. What we cannot afford is to continue spending money at the rate Obama demands.

The Economic Impact

Obama says that “according to economists,” keeping taxes from rising “will have the least positive impact on the economy.” Apparently, Obama continues to talk only to his economists and their fellow travelers.

Recall that these are the same economists who said that Obama’s 2009 stimulus would drive down the unemployment rate. It did not work. They are the same economists who told us the payroll tax holiday would create jobs. It did not work. They are close cousins, by the way, to the economists plying their trade in Europe, driving national unemployment rates above 25 percent in country after country while driving the continent toward another deep recession.

Of all the Bush tax cuts, the reductions in the top rates were not the least effective in strengthening the economy as Obama claims. In fact, they were the most effective because they struck at the very heart of the economic dynamic: incentives. Higher tax rates discourage entrepreneurship and risk taking. They discourage saving by those most capable of saving and, as even the Congressional Budget Office now admits, discourage work effort.[2]

Higher tax rates have these effects because those who are subject to the rates can and do adjust their behavior—sometimes immediately, sometimes after a period. They then take fewer business risks, work fewer hours (or even retire), and save less.

Tax-hike advocates will no doubt once again claim that when they raised tax rates in 1993 under President Clinton, not only did warnings of a recession prove to be unfounded, but the economy subsequently boomed. In fact, though Clinton’s tax hikes didn’t trigger recession, they certainly took the wind out of the economy’s sails at a time when it should have come roaring back from recession.[3] The famous Clinton boom did not follow the tax hikes. The subsequent boom came four years later after an anemic recovery, slow wage growth, and slow job growth. The famous Clinton boom followed the cut in the capital gains tax rate in 1997. Supporters of higher rates tend to skip over these inconvenient facts.

With metaphysical certainty, raising tax rates will slow the economy now and leave wages and incomes permanently lower. Whether the tax hike produces a recession or not depends on how weak the economy is as it faces this new headwind. Hopefully, the economy will be strong enough to take the hit if it comes and then pick up steam as best it can under the new burden.

Inconsistency on Incentives

It is perhaps the greatest irony in American economic policy that those advocating higher income tax rates believe that incentives matter only when the advocates are trying to dictate behavior. For example, The Washington Post recently editorialized in favor of higher cigarette taxes to discourage smoking.[4] The sad, growing fascination with a carbon tax is another case in point. Why a carbon tax? Aside from the massive revenues it promises, proponents argue (correctly) that a carbon tax would create incentives for businesses to move away from carbon-producing activities.

But when it comes to the behaviors that are truly relevant for a strong economy, President Obama and friends turn a blind eye to incentives.

The Real Problem

The nation cannot afford the spending surge initiated under President Obama. The nation’s workers cannot afford the sustained additional upward pressure on unemployment that would follow from raising tax rates. The problem is government spending, especially entitlements. President Obama and Congress should focus on the problem and forget these destructive tax-hike obsessions.

College grads, baby boomers big winners in Trump's economy",2020-02-08,Howard Schneider,"WASHINGTON ( ███ ) - U.S. President Donald Trump rolled out an eye-catching statistic in his State of the Union address Tuesday : the wealth held by the poorest half of American households increased three times as fast as the wealth held by the “ 1 % ” since he became president .
On average , Americans have seen a 17 % jump in household wealth since Trump ’ s election , while wealth at the bottom half has increased 54 % .
“ This is a blue collar boom , ” Trump also said Tuesday . That ’ s less apparent . The biggest winners on a dollar basis were a familiar group - whites , college graduates , and people born during the “ baby boom ” between 1946 and 1964 .
Since December 2016 , President Barack Obama ’ s last full month in office , aggregate household wealth has increased by $ 15.8 trillion , but the vast majority went to groups that have tended to accumulate wealth in the past .
Even with a 54 % increase in their household wealth under Trump , the poorest half of American households , around 64 million families , still have just 1.6 % of household “ net worth . ”
Net worth combines the value of assets like real estate and stocks and subtracts liabilities like mortgage loans and credit card balances .
Because America ’ s bottom 50 % are starting from such a small base , given the enormous disparities in wealth in the United States , even large moves in their fortunes do little to dent the overall distribution . In dollar terms as of the end of September 2019 , that latest data available from the Fed , the combined net worth of the poorest half of families was $ 1.67 trillion out of total U.S. household wealth of $ 107 trillion .
Here is what the Fed ’ s Distributional Financial Accounts have to say :
Historically , 17 % growth in household wealth over 11 three-month “ quarters , ” or nearly three years , is pretty standard . There have been 110 such periods since the Fed ’ s data series begins in mid-1989 , and the most recent ranks 55th , squarely in the middle .
On a quarterly basis , compound growth in household wealth since 1989 has averaged 1.39 % . Under Trump it is slightly less , at 1.34 % .
The bottom half of households saw their net worth rise by 54 % under Trump , from $ 1.08 trillion to $ 1.67 trillion . That ’ s compared to an 18 % rise for the top 1 % , who control roughly a third of the total household wealth in America , or around $ 34.5 trillion .
Even after those gains , that works out to average net worth of around $ 26,000 for the bottom half of households versus around $ 27 million for the ones at the top .
Much of that increase among the bottom half was due to increases in real estate , not stocks , after a resurgence in home ownership rates that began in 2016 .
Wages for lower-skilled jobs have of late been rising faster than those for higher-skilled occupations . January non-farm payrolls data show a bigger-than-expected jump in overall employment , bolstered by an increase in construction jobs .
But it takes time for income to be saved and translate into wealth . Since Trump took office , households headed by a college graduate captured 75 % of the net worth gains , or around $ 11.88 trillion .
They represent about a third of all households , according to the Fed survey on which the data series is based .
Overall , households headed by a high school graduate , a group on the front lines of Trump ’ s pledge to restore blue collar fortunes , lost $ 0.4 trillion in net worth during his time in office . Those households represent about a fourth of the total .
Generationally , households with a head born from 1946 to 1964 did not get fooled again , as the 1971 rock anthem pledged . The title of Trump ’ s speech was “ The Great American Comeback. ” It could just as easily have been “ OK Boomer , What About the Rest of Us ? ”
Baby boomers under Trump , himself a member of that generation , captured around $ 10 trillion of recent wealth gains , or about two-thirds of the total .
The Fed survey ’ s demographic estimates are as of 2016 , and the population would have changed slightly since then . In 2016 about 36 % of household heads ( in the case of mixed-sex couples the Fed considers the man to be the head , in same-sex couples it is the oldest of the two ) were headed by a member of the baby boom .
Wealth accumulates with time , and older people would tend to have a larger base to start with . But for millennials , those born between 1981 and 1996 , the last three years of booming markets have meant an extra half trillion dollars only , spread across about 20.6 % of households . GenX ’ ers , born between 1965 and 1980 , got about 21 % of the gains , and made up roughly 26 % of households . The pre-baby boom “ Silent Generation ” got 16 % of the gains , roughly in line with that group ’ s share of households .
Analyzed by race , the data told a familiar story of inequality . About 84 % of recent wealth gains accrued to the 64 % of households that self-identified to the Fed as white .
About 4.6 % of wealth gains went to the 14.5 % of households that identified as black , and 3.8 % to the 10.1 % of households that identified as Hispanic .

On average, Americans have seen a 17% jump in household wealth since Trump’s election, while wealth at the bottom half has increased 54%.

HALF OF AMERICA

Net worth combines the value of assets like real estate and stocks and subtracts liabilities like mortgage loans and credit card balances.

Because America’s bottom 50% are starting from such a small base, given the enormous disparities in wealth in the United States, even large moves in their fortunes do little to dent the overall distribution. In dollar terms as of the end of September 2019, that latest data available from the Fed, the combined net worth of the poorest half of families was $1.67 trillion out of total U.S. household wealth of $107 trillion.

Here is what the Fed’s Distributional Financial Accounts have to say:

Historically, 17% growth in household wealth over 11 three-month “quarters,” or nearly three years, is pretty standard. There have been 110 such periods since the Fed’s data series begins in mid-1989, and the most recent ranks 55th, squarely in the middle.

On a quarterly basis, compound growth in household wealth since 1989 has averaged 1.39%. Under Trump it is slightly less, at 1.34%.

The bottom half of households saw their net worth rise by 54% under Trump, from $1.08 trillion to $1.67 trillion. That’s compared to an 18% rise for the top 1%, who control roughly a third of the total household wealth in America, or around $34.5 trillion.

Even after those gains, that works out to average net worth of around $26,000 for the bottom half of households versus around $27 million for the ones at the top.

Much of that increase among the bottom half was due to increases in real estate, not stocks, after a resurgence in home ownership rates that began in 2016.

Wages for lower-skilled jobs have of late been rising faster than those for higher-skilled occupations. January non-farm payrolls data show a bigger-than-expected jump in overall employment, bolstered by an increase in construction jobs.

But it takes time for income to be saved and translate into wealth. Since Trump took office, households headed by a college graduate captured 75% of the net worth gains, or around $11.88 trillion.

They represent about a third of all households, according to the Fed survey on which the data series is based.

Overall, households headed by a high school graduate, a group on the front lines of Trump’s pledge to restore blue collar fortunes, lost $0.4 trillion in net worth during his time in office. Those households represent about a fourth of the total.

A BABY BOOMER BOOM

Generationally, households with a head born from 1946 to 1964 did not get fooled again, as the 1971 rock anthem pledged. The title of Trump’s speech was “The Great American Comeback.” It could just as easily have been “OK Boomer, What About the Rest of Us?”

Baby boomers under Trump, himself a member of that generation, captured around $10 trillion of recent wealth gains, or about two-thirds of the total.

The Fed survey’s demographic estimates are as of 2016, and the population would have changed slightly since then. In 2016 about 36% of household heads (in the case of mixed-sex couples the Fed considers the man to be the head, in same-sex couples it is the oldest of the two) were headed by a member of the baby boom.

Wealth accumulates with time, and older people would tend to have a larger base to start with. But for millennials, those born between 1981 and 1996, the last three years of booming markets have meant an extra half trillion dollars only, spread across about 20.6% of households. GenX’ers, born between 1965 and 1980, got about 21% of the gains, and made up roughly 26% of households. The pre-baby boom “Silent Generation” got 16% of the gains, roughly in line with that group’s share of households.

Analyzed by race, the data told a familiar story of inequality. About 84% of recent wealth gains accrued to the 64% of households that self-identified to the Fed as white.

About 4.6% of wealth gains went to the 14.5% of households that identified as black, and 3.8% to the 10.1% of households that identified as Hispanic.

Elizabeth Warren ’ s moralistic tales don ’ t help create effective economic policies .
Senator Elizabeth Warren , foundering in the Democratic primary , is returning to the theme that made her famous : her moralizing account of personal bankruptcy .
As an academic , Warren did research on personal bankruptcy in the United States . “ Our research ended up showing that most of these families weren ’ t reckless or irresponsible , ” she writes , “ they were just getting squeezed by an economy that forced them to take on more debt and more risk to cling to their place in America ’ s middle class. ” That is a peculiar claim . Borrowing money that you can not repay in order to finance personal consumption that you can not afford is precisely the sort of thing one might wish to indicate with the words “ reckless and irresponsible. ” To claim that this is the result of “ getting squeezed by the economy ” is a way of giving your morality play a villain without making any specific person feel bad .
That is one of the things about Warren that appeal to such unlikely admirers as Tucker Carlson : The neo-socialist Left and the neo-nationalist Right are united in their conviction that the American middle class is a victim of forces beyond the control of its members , who therefore must be considered immune to any sort of moral judgment for the state of their lives , their families , or their communities .
The 21st-century tale of college-educated woe in these United States is a strange one .
In the December issue of Harper ’ s , Wes Enzinna shares his preposterous personal odyssey under the headline “ Down and Out in Silicon Valley. ” Housing is indeed absurdly expensive in the Bay Area , for reasons that are largely political rather than organic , but Enzinna ’ s story , colorful as it is ( he took up residence in a shack with no plumbing ) , tells us nothing useful about that . Early in his career , Enzinna moved to work “ at an investigative reporting magazine in San Francisco , ” by which I assume he is politely indicating Mother Jones , the investigative-reporting magazine in San Francisco where his work has appeared . “ My situation , ” he writes , “ was evidence of how distorted the Bay Area housing market had become , the brutality inflicted upon the poor now trickling up to everyone but the super-rich . ”
For personal reasons , he had decided to keep paying rent and residential bills on an apartment in New York City , which , like San Francisco and environs , is very expensive . Enzinna is a 2010 graduate of the graduate journalism program at Berkeley , and his problem is that while working as an early-career magazine journalist he could not afford to rent homes in New York City and the Bay Area simultaneously .
Enzinna describes himself as “ proudly lumpenproletariat , ” but that ’ s an upwardly-mobile-white-guy-with-a-master ’ s-degree problem . There are serious problems with housing in California and in many other places in the United States , particularly those in which ( forgive me for noticing ) Mother Jones–reading progressives enjoy meaningful political power . These problems are felt very intensely by the Spanish-speaking men with white pickup trucks who do so much of the actual work in California . But Enzinna ’ s problem wasn ’ t the housing market — it was that he made a dumb decision in trying to maintain two households in two of the most expensive places in the United States on an income that was merely ordinary . Maybe he had a good reason for that . But the best of intentions do not change the math or the fact that he put himself at the mercy of that math intentionally .
Our policy debates tend to reflect the interests and obsessions of the policymaking classes , who are relatively educated and affluent and disproportionately likely to be employed at magazines based in expensive coastal metros , which is why we spend so much time worrying about things such as college loans and the admissions policies at elite universities . It is no surprise , then , that Senator Warren is revisiting personal bankruptcy with an eye toward making Chapter 7 filings more accessible to relatively high-income people . Chapter 7 bankruptcies differ from Chapter 13 bankruptcies in one important way : They do not require debtors to enter into repayment plans . Chapter 7 filers simply give up whatever assets they have that are not legally excluded from bankruptcy forfeiture , and their debts are discharged ; Chapter 13 filers have to pay back some of their debts from future earnings . For obvious reasons , Chapter 7 is restricted to relatively low-income people ; those with incomes above the median in their state are obliged to file under Chapter 13 . Senator Warren calls this “ an onerous and complicated means test. ” Of course it is a means test : We provide certain subsidies and benefits to poor people because they are poor , and we do not provide the same subsidies and benefits to high-income people , who might reasonably be expected to take a little more responsibility for their debts .
The politics here are obvious enough : This mainly is an attempt to wrongfoot Joe Biden . Senator Warren is a shill for the medical-device manufacturers clustered around Boston ( the tax on them in the grievously misnamed Affordable Care Act is one of the few redistributive levies that Warren doesn ’ t love ) , and Senator Biden was a shill for the credit-card companies that are mostly based in his native Delaware . As an added benefit , it gives Warren an opportunity to remind Democratic voters that she is smarter than Bernie Sanders , the Vermont socialist who rails against “ allah-garky ” in a way that is generally vague and fuzzy in contrast to Warren ’ s shtick of putting her ludicrous BS into bullet-point form .
In California , decades ’ worth of bad public-policy decisions have made it more difficult and less profitable to build housing oriented toward the middle and low end of the market . ( There isn ’ t any iron law of economics establishing that it is more profitable to work the high end of the market — the guy who runs Taco Bell makes a lot more money than Jean-Georges Vongerichten does . ) The same holds true of financial products such as credit and insurance . By making it less profitable and less attractive to serve lower-income and higher-risk consumers , Warren et al . ensure that those households have less access to credit and other financial services and that they pay more for it . Risk comes with a price , and making it more difficult to recover debts adds to the risk of lending , which will add to the price of credit .
One need not think very highly of credit-card companies to understand how the market operates . Moralistic accounts of bankruptcy filers being victimized by . . . people who lent them money when they asked for it . . . are useless as guides to reform — and there is much in American consumer finance that is in need of reform .
But reform in what direction ? If you want more housing for low- and middle-income people , then you need to allow developers to build it , which means creating a policy environment that makes it profitable for them to do so . If you want more affordable and more accessible financial services for people other than those with high incomes and substantial wealth , then you should make it easier to serve those markets rather than more difficult .
The problem for Warren ( who should know better ) and others like her ( who often don ’ t ) is that there is a lot more juice in the moralistic account of economic problems than in the economic account of economic problems . To make things worse , the moralistic account offered by Senator Warren is untrue . Americans are not incapable of being anything other than passive victims of forces beyond their control .

If we are to have beneficial and effective policies — “ providing for those common hazards of life against which few can make adequate provision , ” as F. A.

Americans say go for it,2019-02-04,"Ben White, David Siders, Steven Shepard","The prospect of 70 percent tax rates for multimillionaires and special levies on the super-rich draw howls about creeping socialism and warnings of economic disaster in much of Washington .
But polling suggests that when it comes to soaking the rich , the American public is increasingly on board .
Surveys are showing overwhelming support for raising taxes on top earners , including a new ███/Morning Consult poll released Monday that found 76 percent of registered voters believe the wealthiest Americans should pay more in taxes . A recent Fox News survey showed that 70 percent of Americans favor raising taxes on those earning over $ 10 million — including 54 percent of Republicans .
The numbers suggest the political ground upon which the 2020 presidential campaign will be fought is shifting in dramatic ways , reflecting the rise in inequality in the United States and growing concerns in the electorate about the fairness of the American system .
“ There is a deep wellspring in terms of perception of unfairness in the economy that ’ s been tapped into here that either didn ’ t exist five years ago or existed and had not had a chance to be expressed , ” said Michael Cembalest , chairman of market and investment strategy at JPMorgan Asset Management who has studied the latest tax proposals . “ This is quite a moment in American economic history where all of a sudden in a matter of months this thing has kind of exploded like this . ”

A plan from first-term Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D-N.Y. ) to slap a 70 percent marginal rate on income earned over $ 10 million clocked in at 59 percent support in a recent Hill/HarrisX poll .
The new ███/Morning Consult poll , conducted Feb. 1-2 , found that 61 percent favor a proposal like the “ wealth tax ” recently laid out by Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D-Mass . ) that would levy a 2 percent tax on those with a net worth over $ 50 million and 3 percent on those worth over $ 1 billion . Just 20 percent opposed the idea . The poll surveyed 1,993 registered voters and carries a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percent .
It showed 45 percent favored a plan like that laid out by Ocasio-Cortez while 32 percent opposed it .
Democrats are facing some backlash from conservatives , corporate America and moderates like former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz over their embrace of higher tax rates on the rich and corporations . Shultz recently called Warren ’ s wealth tax “ ridiculous. ” Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg , a potential moderate Democratic candidate in 2020 , likened it to policies in socialist Venezuela .
But Republicans who think they can use the proposals as a political weapon in 2020 to paint Democrats as wild-eyed , tax-and-spend liberals — a winning strategy since Walter Mondale called for higher taxes in 1984 and got crushed — may find it challenging .
“ There is certainly an appetite for more taxes on the rich , though the threshold matters , ” said Karlyn Bowman , a polling expert at the American Enterprise Institute . “ There is also some support for redistributing income . ”
Historical trend data from Gallup show that the percentage of people describing their taxes as too high peaked around 1970 at 69 percent when the top marginal rate was around 70 percent , though the effective rate after deductions and other tax-avoidance strategies was much lower .
The numbers mostly began to decline along with the top marginal rates during the Reagan tax-cut era of the 1980s . Last year , 48 percent described their own taxes as “ about right ” compared with 45 percent who said they were “ too high , ” helping lay the groundwork for Democratic proposals to raise top marginal rates and institute things like a wealth tax to help pay for big , expensive proposals like a “ Green New Deal ” or “ Medicare for All. “
Some Democrats piling into the 2020 race are now competing to get further to the left on boosting taxes on the rich . After Warren ’ s wealth tax announcement , likely candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt. ) , who bucked recent political tradition with calls for tax hikes in his 2016 campaign , unveiled a proposal to increase the number of wealthy Americans subject to the estate tax .
Those who aren ’ t calling for big new taxes — including Sen. Kamala Harris ( D-Calif. ) , who prefers refundable tax credits — are facing some heat on the left as insufficiently progressive .
In an interview , Warren said polling numbers suggesting fairly wide public support for plans like hers to tax the rich did not come as any shock .
“ It ’ s not surprising to me at all . Washington has been working so long for the billionaire class that people around here can not imagine crossing them , ” she said . “ It never even becomes a topic of conversation . The ultra-millionaires have gotten so much from this country that it ’ s not unreasonable to ask them to give back a little bit . ”
She added that she would feel no pressure to tack back to the middle on taxes should she win the Democratic nomination . “ That ’ s just wrong . Why on earth would I do that ? It makes no sense . I think I ’ ve already lost the billionaire vote . ”
In 2016 , then-candidate Donald Trump tapped into the populist moment by railing against Wall Street and promising to deliver blue-collar manufacturing jobs back to the industrial Midwest . He also has a history with the idea of a wealth tax .
In 1999 , while contemplating a presidential bid on the Reform Party ticket , Trump proposed a one-time 14.25 percent tax on those with over $ 10 million in wealth in order to entirely wipe out the national debt .
`` By my calculations , 1 percent of Americans , who control 90 percent of the wealth in this country , would be affected by my plan , ” Trump said at the time , sounding very much like Warren does today .
Trump has long since abandoned that idea , focusing instead on wedge issues like immigration to target voters concerned about their jobs and wages as well as those worried about demographic changes in the country .
But he may have vulnerability on the tax issue heading into 2020 given his biggest legislative accomplishment as president so far was a $ 2 trillion tax cut that showered most of its benefits on corporate America while offering much smaller reductions to middle-class taxpayers .

Elizabeth Warren said polling numbers suggesting fairly wide public support for plans like hers to tax the rich did not come as any shock. | Scott Eisen/Getty Images Economy Soak the rich? Americans say go for it Surveys are showing overwhelming support for raising taxes on top earners.

The prospect of 70 percent tax rates for multimillionaires and special levies on the super-rich draw howls about creeping socialism and warnings of economic disaster in much of Washington.

But polling suggests that when it comes to soaking the rich, the American public is increasingly on board.

Story Continued Below

Surveys are showing overwhelming support for raising taxes on top earners, including a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll released Monday that found 76 percent of registered voters believe the wealthiest Americans should pay more in taxes. A recent Fox News survey showed that 70 percent of Americans favor raising taxes on those earning over $10 million — including 54 percent of Republicans.

The numbers suggest the political ground upon which the 2020 presidential campaign will be fought is shifting in dramatic ways, reflecting the rise in inequality in the United States and growing concerns in the electorate about the fairness of the American system.

“There is a deep wellspring in terms of perception of unfairness in the economy that’s been tapped into here that either didn’t exist five years ago or existed and had not had a chance to be expressed,” said Michael Cembalest, chairman of market and investment strategy at JPMorgan Asset Management who has studied the latest tax proposals. “This is quite a moment in American economic history where all of a sudden in a matter of months this thing has kind of exploded like this.”

Even proposals that sound radical poll well.

A plan from first-term Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) to slap a 70 percent marginal rate on income earned over $10 million clocked in at 59 percent support in a recent Hill/HarrisX poll.

The new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll, conducted Feb. 1-2, found that 61 percent favor a proposal like the “wealth tax” recently laid out by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) that would levy a 2 percent tax on those with a net worth over $50 million and 3 percent on those worth over $1 billion. Just 20 percent opposed the idea. The poll surveyed 1,993 registered voters and carries a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percent.

It showed 45 percent favored a plan like that laid out by Ocasio-Cortez while 32 percent opposed it.

Democrats are facing some backlash from conservatives, corporate America and moderates like former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz over their embrace of higher tax rates on the rich and corporations. Shultz recently called Warren’s wealth tax “ridiculous.” Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a potential moderate Democratic candidate in 2020, likened it to policies in socialist Venezuela.

But Republicans who think they can use the proposals as a political weapon in 2020 to paint Democrats as wild-eyed, tax-and-spend liberals — a winning strategy since Walter Mondale called for higher taxes in 1984 and got crushed — may find it challenging.

“There is certainly an appetite for more taxes on the rich, though the threshold matters,” said Karlyn Bowman, a polling expert at the American Enterprise Institute. “There is also some support for redistributing income.”

Historical trend data from Gallup show that the percentage of people describing their taxes as too high peaked around 1970 at 69 percent when the top marginal rate was around 70 percent, though the effective rate after deductions and other tax-avoidance strategies was much lower.

The numbers mostly began to decline along with the top marginal rates during the Reagan tax-cut era of the 1980s. Last year, 48 percent described their own taxes as “about right” compared with 45 percent who said they were “too high,” helping lay the groundwork for Democratic proposals to raise top marginal rates and institute things like a wealth tax to help pay for big, expensive proposals like a “Green New Deal” or “Medicare for All.“

Some Democrats piling into the 2020 race are now competing to get further to the left on boosting taxes on the rich. After Warren’s wealth tax announcement, likely candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who bucked recent political tradition with calls for tax hikes in his 2016 campaign, unveiled a proposal to increase the number of wealthy Americans subject to the estate tax.

Those who aren’t calling for big new taxes — including Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), who prefers refundable tax credits — are facing some heat on the left as insufficiently progressive.

In an interview, Warren said polling numbers suggesting fairly wide public support for plans like hers to tax the rich did not come as any shock.

“It’s not surprising to me at all. Washington has been working so long for the billionaire class that people around here cannot imagine crossing them,” she said. “It never even becomes a topic of conversation. The ultra-millionaires have gotten so much from this country that it’s not unreasonable to ask them to give back a little bit.”

She added that she would feel no pressure to tack back to the middle on taxes should she win the Democratic nomination. “That’s just wrong. Why on earth would I do that? It makes no sense. I think I’ve already lost the billionaire vote.”

In 2016, then-candidate Donald Trump tapped into the populist moment by railing against Wall Street and promising to deliver blue-collar manufacturing jobs back to the industrial Midwest. He also has a history with the idea of a wealth tax.

In 1999, while contemplating a presidential bid on the Reform Party ticket, Trump proposed a one-time 14.25 percent tax on those with over $10 million in wealth in order to entirely wipe out the national debt.

""By my calculations, 1 percent of Americans, who control 90 percent of the wealth in this country, would be affected by my plan,” Trump said at the time, sounding very much like Warren does today.

Trump has long since abandoned that idea, focusing instead on wedge issues like immigration to target voters concerned about their jobs and wages as well as those worried about demographic changes in the country.

But he may have vulnerability on the tax issue heading into 2020 given his biggest legislative accomplishment as president so far was a $2 trillion tax cut that showered most of its benefits on corporate America while offering much smaller reductions to middle-class taxpayers.

Republicans believe the plan will ultimately lead to consistently faster growth and higher wages. But for now, polls consistently show the tax cut faring poorly. The latest POLITICO/Morning Consult poll found that 33 percent said the bill helped the economy, 41 percent said it hurt or made no difference and 25 percent said they didn’t know or had no opinion. Also in the poll, 65 percent said the nation was on the wrong track and 56 percent disapproved of Trump’s job as president.

The top issue for voters in the poll was the economy, including taxes, wages, unemployment and spending, with 27 percent citing it as their top concern. Security issues, including the border, came in second at 23 percent.

The idea of making the rich pay more has also caught on in some unlikely corners of the corporate world. “I believe that individuals earning the most can afford to pay more,” JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said last week. “And I have no problem paying higher taxes to address some of the fundamental challenges and inequities in our society.”

Republicans are watching the rising support for dramatically higher taxes on the wealthy with some concern, given their brand for decades has been around slashing taxes and reducing the role of government.

“The wrong approach is to try and argue this from a purely ideological lens,” said Kevin Madden, a partner at Hamilton Place Strategies and top adviser to Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign. “Arguing it ideologically puts you into a corner where it looks like you are defending the ultra-rich, and that’s just not a good place to be politically right now.”

Madden said Romney suffered on this point. “This is one of the problems we had in 2012, where at times it looked like Mitt was teaching a course on economics,” he said. “If you are going to push back on the idea of all these taxes, you have to have a compelling case for why a punitive approach on one sector of the economy won’t solve the problem of inequality, and then marry that to a comprehensive plan to address the income gap.”

Cembalest said he takes no position on the wisdom of the Warren or Ocasio-Cortez proposals. And he acknowledged the rise of inequality. But he said it’s important to note it’s not true that taxes now are dramatically lower than in the pre-Reagan years when the marginal rate was as high as 94 percent.

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and New York Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio .
Liberals demanded that gubernatorial candidate Allyson Y. Schwartz cut her ties with Third Way after two of its top officials wrote an op-ed criticizing Ms. Warren and Mr. de Blasio by name , saying they are pushing a “ ‘ we can have it all ’ fantasy . ”
The activist groups Democracy for America and Progressive Change Campaign Committee pounced , demanding that Mrs. Schwartz , who is now a member of the U.S. House , relinquish her position as honorary co-chairwoman of Third Way .
One of her rivals in the Pennsylvania governor ’ s race issued the same challenge .
The Schwartz campaign responded by saying the congresswoman “ obviously disagrees with what was written ” and “ thinks what they wrote was outrageous . ”
The squabble marks the beginning of a fight over the direction of his party as it prepares for the 2016 elections and a new leader .
“ This is the latest in a series of situations that are going to play out in the weeks and months to come as Democrats struggle to figure out how to move forward in the post-Obama era , ” said Jim Manley , a Democratic strategist . “ What is definitely going on is the left sees an opening given the current political dynamic for them to try to assert some sort of control on the Democratic Party . ”
Christy Setzer , a Democratic consultant , said that “ the safety net ’ s making a comeback . ”

Mrs. Warren and Mr. de Blasio have energized the liberal base of the Democratic ranks , which has accused the Obama administration of not fighting hard enough for the issues that they care about most .
Mr. de Blasio won the New York mayoral race Nov. 5 with more than 73 percent of the vote after vowing to raise taxes on the city ’ s wealthier residents to cover the cost of expanded government programs — including universal pre-kindergarten — and to reduce inequality .
Speaking on the floor of the Senate two weeks later , Mrs. Warren said that if the nation wants a real middle class then Congress must get serious about the nation ’ s retirement system because more people than ever are on the edge of financial disaster once they retire .
“ That is why we should be talking about expanding Social Security benefits , not cutting them , ” she said .
In their Wall Street Journal op-ed , Jon Cowan and Jim Kessler , the president and senior vice president for policy of Third Way , took aim at Mrs. Warren and Mr. de Blasio , warning that it would be “ disastrous for Democrats ” to follow their lead on the policy front .
“ The movement relies on a potent ‘ we can have it all ’ fantasy that goes something like this : If we force the wealthy to pay higher taxes ( there are 300,000 tax filers who earn more than $ 1 million ) , close a few corporate tax loopholes , and break up some big banks then — presto ! — we can pay for , and even expand , existing entitlements , ” they wrote . “ Meanwhile , we can invest more deeply in K-12 education , infrastructure , health research , clean energy and more . ”
The Progressive Change Committee , which wants Congress to spend more on Social Security , responded by urging people to call Mrs. Schwartz and warn her that being associated with this “ Wall-Street funded group that attacks Elizabeth Warren ” is not the way to win the Democratic primary .

Kennedy replied , “ The president , since day one … has been working hard to make sure that American families — the American people — are at the center of this administration , and what we are trying to achieve , and we ’ ve seen that in the economy . … We ’ ve seen that in our new trade agreement , the USMCA , with South Korea , and with many others .

Kennedy added , “ One of the things this economy has really been spectacular at is making sure that people who used to be left behind in previous economies — people without college degrees , people who come from more martial backgrounds — have seen some of the biggest gains . ”
Blue-collar workers , added Kennedy , had yielded the largest economic benefits across Trump ’ s presidential tenure .
“ So in manufacturing , the non-supervisory positions — the people who are actually on the floor doing the work — have received the highest wage gains , ” stated Kennedy . “ What USMCA does , one of the most important things it does , is put in place tougher labor standards for manufacturing so we ’ re going to have [ fewer ] factories and manufacturers moving to Mexico , moving out of this country . Instead , because of these provisions , there ’ s a strong incentive for them to stay here . ”
Kennedy remarked , “ So one of the big things we ’ ve seen is manufacturing is kind of roaring back in this country , after so many people that it was never going to come back , at all , that we had to resign ourselves to losing all of our factories . USMCA is really going to solidify that growth and accelerate it . ”
Republicans are unified in opposing Democrats ’ impeachment push against the president , estimated Kennedy .
Boyle asked , “ If there is a [ Senate impeachment trial ] , and there ’ s an eventual Senate vote , do you expect that there may be a bipartisan opposition in the Senate … and do you expect Republicans will stick together other there ?

After the Fed’s Dec. 18-19 meeting, expectations of further hikes shrink, with investors betting on only one move next year. The consensus among economists is for two 2019 hikes. That is partly due to Fed officials signaling in recent speeches that their tightening campaign has succeeded in raising borrowing costs near to territory that they consider neutral in terms of speeding up or slowing the economy.

Fed officials will update quarterly forecasts for the economy and the project path of interest rates at this week’s meeting. In September they penciled in three moves in 2019.

Fed officials have also noted they are paying attention to risks such as slowing growth in Europe and in interest-sensitive sectors of the U.S. economy. Financial conditions have also tightened, partly because of stock-market losses on the White House’s harsh trade rhetoric and fears that uncertainty over Trump’s policies could hit business investment.

Data released in recent weeks show economic growth is moderating in the fourth quarter -- following the strongest back-to-back periods since 2015 -- while remaining faster than the average pace during an expansion poised to become the longest in U.S. history.

While job and wage gains missed forecasts for November, they were still consistent with solid growth, and strong retail sales suggested Americans are opening their wallets for the holiday season. At the same time, many measures of consumer and business sentiment have declined in recent weeks, particularly gauges of the economic outlook, and factory production was weaker than expected last month.

It ’ s a neglected issue , not least because most voters , even in Democratic primaries , live above the poverty threshold , and so economic policy tends to be discussed in terms of helping the “ middle class ” or “ American families , ” not the poorest of the poor .
2020 is shaping up to be a little different . Several Democratic presidential candidates have coalesced on a distinctive approach to fighting poverty — transferring people money — and are including it as part of bigger proposals that help poor and middle-class people alike , ensuring that these ideas have a more prominent spot in the campaign than past anti-poverty plans have had .
So far , rumored and announced candidates have outlined at least five formal proposals designed to direct additional cash to low-income households . These proposals , all co-authored by senators — Cory Booker , Kamala Harris , Sherrod Brown , and Michael Bennet ( Rep. Ro Khanna is a co-sponsor on one ) — attempt to do different things : Two would expand the earned income tax credit ( EITC ) , another two offers assistance for rent , and one is a child allowance . But they all have the same overriding objective : improving the lives of low-income Americans .
The press tends to analyze proposals like these in terms of how much they cost , how realistic their passage is , and so on . And while that ’ s important , I had a different question : Which of these plans would do the most to cut poverty in America ?
It turns out that a team of researchers at Columbia University ’ s Center on Poverty and Social Policy was asking that question too , and they have the skills to actually answer it . They estimated how much each of these five bills would reduce poverty , deep poverty ( measured as the share of people living at or below 50 percent of the poverty line ) , and child poverty .
The five bills are Harris ’ s LIFT the Middle Class Act and Rent Relief Act ; Brown and Khanna ’ s GAIN Act ; Booker ’ s HOME Act ; and Brown and Bennet ’ s American Family Act . And according to Columbia analysis , all five would significantly cut poverty .
All of them cost a lot — but they all cost about the same or less than the recent round of Republican tax cuts . All five are more ambitious than any cash proposals during the 2016 primary , or any other Democratic primary I can remember . And in a head-to-head matchup of all five , two plans ( surprisingly ) stood out as doing the most to reduce poverty at the least cost : bills from Cory Booker and Kamala Harris subsidizing rent for low-income households .
But all five are worth consideration . Let ’ s dive into each and how they stack up against one another .
Every one of the five proposals reduces poverty , and child poverty , substantially . But the proposals differ in cost and in the scale of their effect on poverty rates . The most effective bill reduces poverty by 1.3 percentage points more than the least effective bill , meaning it would lift some 4.2 million additional people out of poverty .
To compare the effects of each plan , the researchers set a baseline poverty rate . They projected a baseline poverty rate of 13.5 percent , a deep poverty rate of 4.9 percent , and a child poverty rate of 14.8 percent , before any programs are enacted . ( The researchers use the supplemental poverty measure — a more accurate metric the Census Bureau releases as an alternative to the official poverty measure — as their bar . )
They then estimated how much each of the five proposals would change these baseline poverty numbers . Here ’ s what they found :
The differences in effects can be explained by the fact that the bills all attempt to do different things . Two bills are effectively massive expansions of the EITC , which provides supplemental cash to low-income people who work :
The LIFT ( Livable Incomes for Families Today ) the Middle Class Act ( $ 247 billion a year ) by Kamala Harris would add another credit tied to work paid out monthly at a rate of $ 3,000 a year for childless single adults and $ 6,000 a year for couples or parents , phasing out for childless singles who make at least $ 50,000 a year and couples and parents who make $ 100,00 .
( $ 247 billion a year ) by Kamala Harris would add another credit tied to work paid out monthly at a rate of $ 3,000 a year for childless single adults and $ 6,000 a year for couples or parents , phasing out for childless singles who make at least $ 50,000 a year and couples and parents who make $ 100,00 . The GAIN ( Grow American Incomes Now ) Act ( $ 111 billion a year ) by Sherrod Brown and Ro Khanna would double or triple the EITC ’ s benefits , depending on family size , and increase the maximum income for families to receive the credit from the mid- $ 40,000 range to as high as $ 75,000 .
Two bills are meant to provide rental assistance by giving away cash . ( Elizabeth Warren also has an affordable housing bill , but it spends money directly on building low-cost housing , rather than distributing it to renters as cash the way the below bills do , so we left it out of this analysis . ) :
Finally , one bill would establish a child allowance , a policy common in rich countries wherein parents receive a regular cash stipend for each child they ’ re raising , both to reduce poverty and to defray the costs of raising the next generation :
The American Family Act ( $ 91 billion a year ) , by Sherrod Brown and fellow potential candidate Michael Bennet , would provide $ 3,000 a year for kids 6 to 18 , and $ 3,600 per year for kids 0 to 5 , paid out monthly to everyone earning under $ 75,000 ( single parents ) or $ 110,000 ( couples ) , after which the credit would phase out . The version of the bill set to be introduced in Congress will feature higher phaseout thresholds , the Columbia team ( which is in touch with the staff drafting it ) says , so the Columbia researchers modeled it with phaseouts at $ 130,000 for single parents and $ 180,000 for couples .
Every one of these five bills would lift millions of Americans out of poverty . Even the “ least ” effective one — the GAIN Act — would reduce the poverty rate by 2 points , which means lifting 6.6 million people out of poverty .
But each one approaches that task differently . For instance , the American Family Act by Brown and Bennet , which pays out $ 250 to $ 300 a month per child to low- and middle-income parents , would cut child poverty especially deeply . The American Family Act also cuts deep poverty more than the other plans , suggesting that deep poverty is concentrated among families with kids .
The bill that makes the biggest dent in overall poverty was Harris ’ s LIFT Act . That makes sense , as it ’ s by far the most expensive . But the second most effective — and this was a surprise to me — is Cory Booker ’ s HOME Act , a rental subsidy bill that provides tax credits to rent-burdened households . ( More on this below . )
The researcher team at Columbia — Christopher Wimer , Sophie Collyer , Robert Paul Hartley , and Sara Kimberlin — also wanted to find out how the bills compared on a cost-equivalent basis .
That is , Bennet-Brown ’ s child tax credit plan costs less than half what Kamala Harris ’ s LIFT Act would cost every year . If they were both scaled to cost the same , what would be the impact ?
So the Columbia team produced cost-equivalent estimates of the bills ’ effects on poverty , estimating what the bills would do to poverty if they all cost the same amount . In order to keep the comparisons simple , they keep the proposed beneficiaries constant and either inflate or deflate the net benefits . Here ’ s how the plans stack up if they all cost $ 247 billion a year , the cost of the most expensive proposal ( Harris ’ s LIFT Act ) :
Here , too , Booker ’ s HOME Act fares extremely well — but even it is bested by Kamala Harris ’ s other cash proposal : the Rent Relief Act , which , like the HOME Act , would give tax credits to households paying high rents . Giving money in the form of rental assistance appears to be more efficient , dollar for dollar , in reducing poverty than handing it out with more strings attached .
Another way to weigh the bills against each other is to compare how much of their cost goes to each segment of the US income distribution : those in deep poverty ( less than half the poverty line ) ; those in poverty but not deep poverty ( 50 to 100 percent of the poverty line ) ; those near poverty ( between 100 and 150 percent of the poverty line ) ; those who are not poor but still low-income ( between 150 percent and 200 percent of the poverty line ) ; and lower-middle- , middle- , and high-income people making twice the poverty line or above .
Everyone low-income and below is struggling , and the “ higher income ” category still includes many lower-middle and middle-class people who could use assistance . But mapping out where the benefits go among these groups gives you a sense of how targeted each plan is to the ultra-poor versus the working class generally .
This analysis reveals that the rental assistance bills are very well-targeted to the poor and ultra-poor :
Harris ’ s Rent Relief Act costs less than half as much as her LIFT Act . But while the latter provides $ 39.1 billion a year to people in poverty , the former provides $ 42 billion . It ’ s vastly cheaper , and yet it directs more money to people in poverty .
Booker ’ s HOME Act , which costs significantly more per year than Harris ’ s rental bill , accordingly provides $ 51.9 billion to households in poverty , the most of any plan considered .
Going into this analysis , I honestly expected the Bennet-Brown child benefit bill to be the most focused for reducing poverty . It has no phase-in or work requirement the way the LIFT and GAIN Acts do , so it ’ s available to the poorest parents in a way that existing tax credits are not at all .
But the rental bills outdid it . Columbia ’ s Robert Paul Hartley notes , “ The rental plans ’ effects on poverty make a lot of sense when you think about how poor renters are relative to owners , and how GAIN and LIFT are really geared toward the middle class ” and making EITC benefits available to the middle class . Fellow researcher Sara Kimberlin adds that housing and utilities “ generally make up the largest share of total basic needs expenses for most families. ” A targeted credit meant to address those expenses would , thus , be expected to have a very strong effect on poverty .
To some extent , the problem being identified here is the same one that sociologist Matthew Desmond explicated in his excellent book Evicted . Desmond notes that even in relatively low-rent cities like Milwaukee ( as opposed to hyper-expensive coastal cities like San Francisco or New York ) , the constant burden of rent and the additional burdens and costs of being evicted for failure to pay helps trap poor families and prevent them from escaping both poverty itself and poor , low-opportunity neighborhoods . ( Desmond endorsed the Harris rental credit bill in a statement released upon the bill ’ s unveiling . )
The rental subsidy bills , however , could have an unintended consequence that hampers their poverty-reducing potential : They could raise rents , particularly in cities like New York or San Francisco , where demand for housing vastly outstrips supply . Rental subsidies , by definition , increase demand for housing . That doesn ’ t have to lead to an increase in rents if developers respond by increasing housing supply in turn , but in many American cities and particularly suburbs , bans on multi-family housing ( a.k.a . “ single-family zoning ” ) , onerous parking requirements , height limitations , and other zoning measures combine to artificially strangle the construction of new apartment units .
In that environment , a sudden surge in demand for housing due to rental credits could lead to increased market rents all around . The Harris and Booker bills would adapt to this reality , because the size of their credits is pegged to prevailing rents in the area where the beneficiary lives . But if the credit grows in response to a spike in rents that it generated , that increases the price tag of the program from the federal government ’ s perspective and risks setting off a vicious cycle . Booker ’ s bill includes inducements to local governments to adopt laxer zoning rules , which could mitigate this problem , but Harris ’ s bill does not include that component .
Hartley , at Columbia , argued in an email to me that rental costs are such a huge part of low-income budgets that policies increasing the EITC or child tax credit could have the same problem : They ’ d boost demand for housing as well . He also noted that Booker ’ s and Harris ’ s bills distribute the rental credit on a yearly basis . If people see it as part of their tax return , that might disincline recipients to use it to find and pay for a higher-rent apartment .
He also notes that the most recent empirical study on the effect of rent subsidies in the US on rental prices — by economists Michael Eriksen and Amanda Ross — found small effects even in supply-constrained markets , though as Brookings Institution economist Jenny Schuetz added on Twitter , we ’ ve never had subsidies on the scale of the Booker or Harris proposals before .
These bills are meant to do more than reduce poverty
This analysis does not tell you everything you need to know to evaluate these proposals . These plans have goals other than poverty reduction .
Harris ’ s LIFT Act and Brown and Khanna ’ s GAIN Act , for instance , are meant to make work more lucrative for low- and middle-income families who aren ’ t necessarily poor . The Bennet-Brown child benefit is meant to go to even upper-middle-class families and defray child care expenses . The rental assistance bills are , first and foremost , housing policy .
There are also other bills that will likely have an impact on poverty that the Columbia team has not yet modeled . Primary among these are a job guarantee proposal from Bernie Sanders and an actual bill from Cory Booker ( backed by New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ) , and Elizabeth Warren ’ s housing bill , which targets affordable housing construction rather than sending money directly to renters . The candidates are also likely to run on big spending plans that focus their benefits on the middle class and probably won ’ t make a big dent in poverty , like free college or paid family leave . Medicare-for-all would likely reduce poverty somewhat , but that depends a lot on how it ’ s financed , and in particular on whether poor people now getting Medicaid have to pay new taxes .
It ’ s also important to keep in mind that many candidates have endorsed each other ’ s proposals . Gillibrand , Warren , Sen. Jeff Merkley ( D-OR ) , and Kamala Harris have endorsed Booker ’ s job guarantee bill ; Gillibrand and Merkley have endorsed Harris ’ s Rent Relief Act ; Gillibrand , Warren , Booker , Harris , and Sen. Amy Klobuchar ( D-MN ) have all endorsed the Bennet-Brown child benefit bill . These aren ’ t either/or propositions ; it is possible to enact multiple of these plans . Indeed , Harris and Sherrod Brown have each sponsored two .
That means the 2020 primaries could see a virtuous cycle as candidates compete to see who can put together the more effective anti-poverty platform , with the most resources going to the deeply poor . The competition is already off to a good start .","Presidential campaigns are not usually about poverty. It’s a neglected issue, not least because most voters, even in Democratic primaries, live above the poverty threshold, and so economic policy tends to be discussed in terms of helping the “middle class” or “American families,” not the poorest of the poor.

2020 is shaping up to be a little different. Several Democratic presidential candidates have coalesced on a distinctive approach to fighting poverty — transferring people money — and are including it as part of bigger proposals that help poor and middle-class people alike, ensuring that these ideas have a more prominent spot in the campaign than past anti-poverty plans have had.

So far, rumored and announced candidates have outlined at least five formal proposals designed to direct additional cash to low-income households. These proposals, all co-authored by senators — Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Sherrod Brown, and Michael Bennet (Rep. Ro Khanna is a co-sponsor on one) — attempt to do different things: Two would expand the earned income tax credit (EITC), another two offers assistance for rent, and one is a child allowance. But they all have the same overriding objective: improving the lives of low-income Americans.

The press tends to analyze proposals like these in terms of how much they cost, how realistic their passage is, and so on. And while that’s important, I had a different question: Which of these plans would do the most to cut poverty in America?

It turns out that a team of researchers at Columbia University’s Center on Poverty and Social Policy was asking that question too, and they have the skills to actually answer it. They estimated how much each of these five bills would reduce poverty, deep poverty (measured as the share of people living at or below 50 percent of the poverty line), and child poverty.

The five bills are Harris’s LIFT the Middle Class Act and Rent Relief Act; Brown and Khanna’s GAIN Act; Booker’s HOME Act; and Brown and Bennet’s American Family Act. And according to Columbia analysis, all five would significantly cut poverty.

All of them cost a lot — but they all cost about the same or less than the recent round of Republican tax cuts. All five are more ambitious than any cash proposals during the 2016 primary, or any other Democratic primary I can remember. And in a head-to-head matchup of all five, two plans (surprisingly) stood out as doing the most to reduce poverty at the least cost: bills from Cory Booker and Kamala Harris subsidizing rent for low-income households.

But all five are worth consideration. Let’s dive into each and how they stack up against one another.

(The researchers use the supplemental poverty measure — a more accurate metric the Census Bureau releases as an alternative to the official poverty measure — as their bar.)

The GAIN (Grow American Incomes Now) Act ($111 billion a year) by Sherrod Brown and Ro Khanna would double or triple the EITC’s benefits, depending on family size, and increase the maximum income for families to receive the credit from the mid-$40,000 range to as high as $75,000.

Two bills are meant to provide rental assistance by giving away cash. (Elizabeth Warren also has an affordable housing bill, but it spends money directly on building low-cost housing, rather than distributing it to renters as cash the way the below bills do, so we left it out of this analysis.):

Finally, one bill would establish a child allowance, a policy common in rich countries wherein parents receive a regular cash stipend for each child they’re raising, both to reduce poverty and to defray the costs of raising the next generation:

The American Family Act ($91 billion a year), by Sherrod Brown and fellow potential candidate Michael Bennet, would provide $3,000 a year for kids 6 to 18, and $3,600 per year for kids 0 to 5, paid out monthly to everyone earning under $75,000 (single parents) or $110,000 (couples), after which the credit would phase out.

Continued job growth has boosted prospects for the U.S. economy, but it continues to face some tricky crosswinds. The big drop in oil prices and a stronger dollar both help the economy and hurt it. Add to that the recent slowdown in global growth.

Lots of economists have suggested the big drop in oil prices is a gift to consumers that will propel the economy. David Kotok of Cumberland Advisors is one of them. He argues that cheaper oil will ultimately be a positive.

""The U.S. comes out a big winner on a falling energy price, but it takes time to filter through and into the full economy,"" Kotok says.

And it starts out as a negative shock to the oil sector. Kotok says cuts in production and energy company payrolls will cost the U.S. economy up to $150 billion. That's made investors nervous. As oil prices fell sharply in January, they sent stock markets gyrating.

But as lower energy prices filter through the economy, Kotok says, the positive effects, worth $400 billion, will overwhelm the negative.

Economist Liz Ann Sonders, the chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, agrees.

""The U.S. economy is 68 percent consumer spending, so right there you know that falling oil prices is a benefit,"" she says.

That puts money in consumers' pockets. Low energy prices also benefit many businesses, whose hiring will more than offset the losses in the energy sector. But, Sonders says, the oil and gas layoffs are making headlines.

""The crash in oil prices happened fast and furiously, and now we're getting those series of layoffs, and rig counts are dropping,"" Sonders says. ""And now people are concerned: Is this going to carry further into the economy? How much of this is a function of weak global growth?""

There's good reason to be concerned, says Jeffrey Snider, head of global investment research at Alhambra Partners.

""Whenever you see oil prices collapse, especially by something like 60 percent, something else is going on, and so therefore, any benefit that might come to consumers in the form of lower energy prices is being overwhelmed by whatever it is that's causing oil to fall in the first place,"" Snider says.

And falling oil prices are a clear sign of a dangerously weak global economy, he says.

""You have economies from Europe, Japan, China that are either in or very close to recession or some form of growth that is significantly degraded,"" Snider says.

And, he says, recent data suggest U.S. consumers are saving most of their windfall from lower energy prices, not spending it to fuel growth.

""That's an indication of very cautious behavior,"" he says.

That caution suggests underlying problems in the U.S. economy, including slow wage growth, he says.

Snider says another crosswind is chilling profits for American exporters and multinationals: the strong dollar.

Sonders agrees that earnings at multinationals are being hit, but she argues that a strong dollar signals confidence in the U.S. economy that is historically associated with strong growth.

""We're not an export-oriented economy. Most other countries that want to try to lower the value of their currency [do it] because a bigger part of their economy is export-oriented, so they want that weaker currency to boost exports.""

In the U.S., exports account for just 13 percent of economic activity.

Sonders says the U.S. is likely to weather the crosswinds in the global economy and experience solid growth in 2015. Kotok goes even further. He says the U.S. will show gradual improvement for the rest of the decade.

""We're going to do it with a stronger currency, little inflation and low interest rates. It's a pretty picture for the United States,"" Kotok says.

The strong jobs figures reported on Friday — with more than a million jobs created in the past three months — bolster that optimistic view.",www.npr.org,center,yYdolMAGcRJWahWC

(+video),2014-01-09,Elizabeth Barber,"President Obama has selected the first places slated to receive a broad package of aid to relieve poverty as part of his “ promise zone ” program , an initiative to help poor individuals by boosting the geographic area in which they live .
The five zones , to be announced by the president Thursday , include slices of San Antonio , Philadelphia , Los Angeles , and southeastern Kentucky , as well as the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma .
The `` promise zone '' program , coming five decades after former President Lyndon Johnson pledged a “ war on poverty ” in the US , is not new in method . It echoes the Kennedy and Johnson administrations ' programs to revitalize ailing communities in the Appalachian region , George H.W . Bush-era enterprise zones , the Clinton administration 's empowerment zones , and even Mr. Obama 's 2010 National Revitalization Initiative ( NRI ) . But while the strategy of honing in on struggling places is well tried , the results of such efforts are not conclusive .
Evaluations of the Clinton empowerment zones ( EZs ) did not reach consensus on whether the program produced positive results in the blighted ZIP Codes to which it extended , and NRI has not yet been reviewed . Unless the promise zone initiative includes meticulous mechanisms for assessing its own successes and failures , experts say , it could be as difficult as ever to tell how much the new program helps the needy people for whom it is being launched .
The promise zone initiative , first unveiled in Obama 's 2013 State of the Union speech , comes amid a broader push from the Obama administration to articulate a national response to income inequality . Last month , Obama said the theme of his efforts this year would be to rekindle President Johnson ’ s fight against economic inequality , still a pressing problem 50 years out from Johnson ’ s declaration of a `` war '' meant to help the poorest of America ’ s poor .
The promise zone program is expected to launch in 20 “ zones , ” rural regions as well as sections of cities , to be selected over the next four years . The zones are to retain their special designation for 10 years . During that time , the communities will receive various tax credits , if approved by Congress , designed to promote job growth and investment , as well as coordinated help from federal agencies to tackle social problems ranging from violent crime to troubling high school dropout rates .
The aim , the Obama administration has said , is to cultivate in each zone the social and economic conditions in which real change is possible .
“ A child ’ s ZIP Code should never determine her destiny , ” says the White House , on its webpage for promise zones , “ but today , the neighborhood she grows up in impacts her odds of graduating high school , her health outcomes , and her lifetime economic opportunities . ”
The promise zone program would not provide direct funding to targeted zones , but its proposed tax credits would require approval from Congress .
ZIP Code-targeted policies , often called “ place-based ” policies , date from at least 1933 , when President Franklin Roosevelt created the Tennessee Valley Authority in hopes of rescuing parts of the southeastern US from the bludgeoning that the Great Depression had dealt them . In 1963 , President Kennedy launched what came to be known as the Appalachian Regional Commission , which Johnson expanded and pushed through Congress in 1965 .
Such policies have also received considerable Republican support . Throughout the 1980s , President Reagan pushed for an enterprise zone program that would offer job-creating incentives to businesses in cash-strapped , floundering urban neighborhoods , but could not get the measure through Congress . The program was later launched by the George H.W . Bush administration .
Obama 's promise zone initiative is modeled on the Clinton administration ’ s EZ program , which distributed tax credits to economically distressed urban neighborhoods , as well as on Obama ’ s NRI program , which works with designated “ promise neighborhoods ” to address social and economic issues , said an administration official , speaking anonymously before Thursday 's announcement .
The promise zone program will build on lessons learned from these two earlier initiatives , says James Quane , associate director of the Joblessness and Urban Poverty Research Program at Harvard University 's Kennedy School of Government and an adviser on the promise zone program .
“ We ’ ve seen these programs for decades , but this is a new twist , ” he says . “ In hindsight , we ’ ve learned a lot . ”
Still , it 's not clear how effective previous programs have been and how the administration will tell if the new program is working , says Dr. Quane .
“ The fact of the matter is that the evaluation research is not in agreement , ” he adds .
A 1996 interim report from the US Office of Housing and Urban Development on Mr. Clinton 's EZ program reported “ mixed ” results , with progress varying widely between the six original zones : Though job growth had occurred in five of the EZ zones , unemployment had risen in Chicago . In 2011 , Scott Upshaw , executive director of the EZ program , called the Chicago zone “ underwhelmingly successful . ''
Other reports have provided more encouraging feedback . In 2006 , an independent assessment of the EZ program from 1994-2006 in the six original zones found that the program had created about $ 1 billion in additional wage earnings in the target areas , as well as another $ 1 billion in property wealth . It also reported that unemployment had decreased by about 30,000 people and that 50,000 EZ zone residents had been lifted above the poverty line .
The difference in assessments reflects a problem addressed in the Government Accountability Office ’ s 2006 report on the EZ program : The initiative had included few mechanisms to ensure that the full spectrum of data needed to assess its effectiveness was in fact collected . Without a rich body of data , assessing EZ ’ s impact was difficult , said the report , which concluded that “ although improvements in poverty , unemployment , and economic growth had occurred , ” analysts “ could not tie these changes definitively to the EZ designation . ”
Disparities in assessments of “ place-based ” programs also arise from the sheer complexity of evaluating these programs , says Mark Partridge , a professor of rural-urban policy at The Ohio State University .
That ’ s because assessing whether a program has benefited the target ZIP Code requires either comparing the area to a similar one that has gone without benefits or contrasting it with its former status , he says . In either case , it ’ s difficult to assess if the differences should be credited to the program , or to other factors , he says .
“ A caveat for any good news is : How much of it was because of the program , ” says Dr. Partridge . “ Did the program work or was this place just poised for takeoff ? ”
Analysts have also express concern that it can be hard to tell whether a program ’ s benefits reach the poorest people , rather than flowing largely into the hands of the business owners who get the tax credits , says Partridge . Another concern is that one neighborhood ’ s program might in fact penalize surrounding communities , drawing jobs , investment , and people away from nearby places not incorporated into the initiative and effectively “ shifting the problem around the map , ” he says .

He doesn’t care.,2016-02-18,"Matthew Yglesias, Theodore Schleifer, Li Zhou, Sean Collins, Umair Irfan, Jen Kirby, Alex Abad-Santos","Four former top economists in Democratic administrations signed a letter taking Bernie Sanders 's campaign to task for touting a document by University of Massachusetts economist Gerald Friedman that purports to show that Sanders 's policies would boost the American growth rate to more than 5 percent .
Alan Krueger , Austan Goolsbee , Christina Romer , and Laura D'Andrea Tyson all served at one time or another as chairs of the Council of Economic Advisers under either Barack Obama or Bill Clinton ; their letter is n't signed by three other CEA chairs from Clinton 's tenure : Janet Yellen ( who 's busy running the Fed ) , Joseph Stiglitz ( who 's well to the left of this group ) , and Martin Baily ( who tells me he did n't know anything about it ) .
The letter cites Friedman 's assumption that the economy would grow by 5.3 percent under Sanders , and comments , `` No credible economic research supports economic impacts of these magnitudes . '' Further , the economists argue that making this kind of claim undermines `` our party ’ s best traditions of evidence-based policy making and undermines our reputation as the party of responsible arithmetic . ''
Somewhat ironically , this group of empirically minded wonks does n't actually offer an empirical critique of the study they are worried about — relying simply on their authority as Democratic Party luminaries to bat it down .
This controversy is , on one level , almost totally meaningless . No president in any era operating under any set of circumstances has managed to pass a complete legislative agenda , and the combination of partisan polarization , an entrenched House GOP majority , and the extremely ambitious nature of Sanders 's agenda makes it totally inconceivable that a Sanders administration would pass all of its policy proposals .
Asking what would happen if the entire Sanders agenda is enacted is a little like asking what would happen if Sanders brought his mid-range game to the Golden State Warriors . To the extent that anyone is backing Sanders because they have read Friedman 's paper , the fact that none of this is going to happen is a bigger problem than any questions about Friedman 's forecasts .
However , on another level , the Friedman paper and the attacks on it from Democratic Party wonks are an interesting window into how the primary is playing out behind the scenes . Clinton has achieved such overwhelming party insider support that the Sanders campaign is largely cut off from access to the kind of para-party policy wonk universe that would allow Sanders to release campaign proposals that pass muster by the traditional rules of the game .
But he 's managed to make a virtue out of this weakness and harness it to the larger significance of the Sanders project — an effort to turn the Democratic Party into a more ideological party that operates more like a progressive mirror image of the conservative Republican Party and less of a broad coalition of interest groups mediated by technocrats .
Gerald Friedman has a very optimistic view of the Sanders agenda
The headline conclusion of Friedman 's paper is that under Bernienomics , `` the growth rate of the real gross domestic product will rise from 2.1 % per annum to 5.3 % so that real GDP per capita will be over $ 20,000 higher in 2026 than is projected under the current policy . ''
When Jeb Bush promised 4 percent growth , centrist-to-liberal economists were derisive , and even the most Jeb-friendly economists would n't quite endorse the claim . Friedman is promising even more than that , and the CEA letter reflects a similar level of skepticism .
I asked Dean Baker from the Center for Economic and Policy Research , one of the more left-wing and Sanders-friendly economists in the Washington policy world , what he thought of the 5.3 percent target . He , in the nicest possible way , suggested it is unrealistic :
Well , there is still plenty of slack in the economy , so having a year of 5.3 percent growth is not impossible ( Fed willing ) , but if he said this was a sustainable rate , that seems pretty hard to imagine . ( It 's not clear to me from this piece , that he said 5.3 % was sustainable . ) My view is that we can probably have somewhat better productivity growth if we had a stronger economy ( firms try to economize on labor ) , but getting much over 2.0 percent is hard to imagine . And once we get back to full employment , we should be looking at relatively modest labor force growth ( @ 0.5 % ) , which means that getting much over 2.5 percent growth on a sustained basis is pretty questionable .
Obviously opinions differ considerably about the merits of various aspects of Sanders 's agenda . But it 's on these questions of slack , full employment , and labor force growth where Friedman departs most clearly from the economic consensus .
Consider this chart , laying out Friedman 's view of how Bernienomics will impact the employment rate , or the share of the adult population that has a job :
Reasonable people can ( and will ) disagree about how Sanders 's plans would impact the labor market . But virtually every expert I 've ever discussed this with believes that one reason the employment rate has declined since 1999 is that old people are a larger share of the population today than they were 17 years ago . The main reason the CBO expects the employment rate to fall in the future is that this aging process is set to continue . This means the `` full employment '' level of employment is simply lower than it was in the past .
Friedman , by contrast , appears to believe that the full employment level is right where it was in the waning days of the Clinton administration , and that with good policy we can get back there .
Friedman does not , however , discuss the demographic change issue at all in his paper . Instead , in a footnote he argues that `` women ’ s employment will be encouraged by the Paycheck Fairness Act , which will raise the wages of women , encouraging more to seek paid employment . '' No empirical evidence is offered that such a modest piece of legislation will have an impact this large , nor is much made of the fact that a large share of the growth benefit of the Sanders agenda is being attributed to this consensus Democratic policy , rather than to his more unusual positions .
Conversely , some of Sanders 's more distinctive signature ideas would almost certainly depress labor force participation even in a sympathetic view .
For example , if you made college free , some young people who would otherwise work full time would instead go to school and work part time . Some students who currently work part time would reduce their hours or cut back to zero . A proponent of free college would likely describe these as benefits of the free college universe — and certainly foreign countries where college is much cheaper than the United States see fewer school-age people in the labor force .
By the same token , Sanders 's `` Medicare for all '' and expanded Social Security plans would almost certainly increase the number of people who retire early . Free health care would make it easier to be retired for a year or five before Social Security benefits kick in , more generous Social Security would reduce the amount of intact savings people need once the benefits do kick in , and the higher taxes to finance the Medicare-for-all plan would make working slightly less lucrative .
None of that is necessarily a bad thing — reducing old people 's need to toil is a very nice idea — but , like free college , it tends to cut against Friedman 's view that Bernienomics will create a surge of employment .
It 's noteworthy that the former CEA chairs criticizing Friedman did n't bother to run through a detailed explanation of their problems with the paper . To them , the 5.3 percent figure was simply absurd on its face , and it was good enough for them to say so , relying on their authority to generate media coverage .
And to an extent , mission accomplished . The coverage has been generated . But for better or for worse , the entire premise of the Sanders campaign is that the existing Democratic Party establishment needs to be overthrown , so imperious dismissals by establishment figures do n't really hurt Sanders . His policy director , Warren Gunnels , told Danielle Kurtzleben that the economists in question are `` the establishment of the establishment '' and claimed to be unbothered by the criticisms .
`` That does not bother us at all , '' he told her . `` What bothers us is the fact that the U.S. has more kids living in poverty than nearly any major country on earth . ''
Bernie sympathizers like the Week 's Ryan Cooper and veteran left-wing political operative Jeff Hauser simply view the letter signers as non-credible , referring to an old Goolsbee column and to Tyson 's service on corporate boards .
speaking of W O N K S , here 's one Austan Goolsbee w/a 2007 take about how subprime mortgages help the poor https : //t.co/wzXczmY6Cc — ryan cooper ( @ ryanlcooper ) February 17 , 2016
@ mattyglesias @ ryanlcooper Wait , Ryan , you are skeptical of value of critique of Sanders from an actual Morgan Stanley Board of Director ? — Jeff Hauser ( @ jeffhauser ) February 17 , 2016
To Sanders skeptics , this style of response is itself worrying . Paul Krugman , for example , wrote about the letter and said , `` If your response to these concerns is that they ’ re all corrupt , all looking for jobs with Hillary , you are very much part of the problem . ''
The dismissals of the critiques of Friedman 's praise for Sanders 's plan are , in a way , more telling and informative than either the Friedman paper or the critiques of it . Sanders and his core constituency simply do n't care .
Sanders is running a style of campaign that 's very unusual for a prominent Democrat but extremely common for a Republican . Marco Rubio , for example , has proposed a large tax cut , a balanced budget amendment , an increase in defense spending , and to prevent any cuts in Social Security or Medicare for people currently at or near retirement .
This is , obviously , not possible , but it has n't been a problem for Rubio in the GOP primary because the 2016 GOP primary — like the 2012 , 2008 , 2000 , 1996 , and 1988 primaries — have n't been about who has the best policy plans . It is about how conservative ideology should be defined and — among those who share a similar definition — who is its most effective champion . The 1980 and 1976 GOP primaries were about whether the Republican Party should be a vehicle of the conservative movement or whether it should continue in the Eisenhower/Nixon/Ford model of right-leaning interest group brokerage — with the conservatives winning in 1980 and never letting go .
Democrats for almost all of this time have not defined themselves as a mirror image of the conservative GOP . Instead , they are a left-leaning coalition of interest groups looking for group wins that tends to downplay ideology . This is why , historically , evaluating `` plans '' has been a very important part of Democratic politics .
Sanders 's campaign against Hillary Clinton is more like Ronald Reagan 's battle with Gerald Ford than like the Obama-Clinton primary of 2008 . As part of his political revolution , Sanders wants to change the Democratic Party ( which he historically was not even a member of ) into a much more ideological political party . Consequently , for Sanders the point of taking policy positions is much more about showing where he stands and who his friends and enemies are than it is about the details of policymaking . What he would actually do as president , after all , is going to be constrained by political realities and his ability to mobilize the public
To Sanders 's critics , of course , this is just gross irresponsibility that neglects the best traditions of the Democratic Party and raises serious questions about Sanders 's ability to do serious policy analysis when the time comes to make choices . But to his fans , fetishizing wonky details is just a way of circumscribing policy proposals to what can be uncontroversially modeled in a world where obtaining and deploying concrete political power — not drawing up more and better white papers — is the crucial task for progressive politics .","Four former top economists in Democratic administrations signed a letter taking Bernie Sanders's campaign to task for touting a document by University of Massachusetts economist Gerald Friedman that purports to show that Sanders's policies would boost the American growth rate to more than 5 percent.

@mattyglesias @ryanlcooper Wait, Ryan, you are skeptical of value of critique of Sanders from an actual Morgan Stanley Board of Director? — Jeff Hauser (@jeffhauser) February 17, 2016

To Sanders skeptics, this style of response is itself worrying. Paul Krugman, for example, wrote about the letter and said, ""If your response to these concerns is that they’re all corrupt, all looking for jobs with Hillary, you are very much part of the problem.""

Bernie Sanders is building a more ideological party

The dismissals of the critiques of Friedman's praise for Sanders's plan are, in a way, more telling and informative than either the Friedman paper or the critiques of it. Sanders and his core constituency simply don't care.

Sanders is running a style of campaign that's very unusual for a prominent Democrat but extremely common for a Republican. Marco Rubio, for example, has proposed a large tax cut, a balanced budget amendment, an increase in defense spending, and to prevent any cuts in Social Security or Medicare for people currently at or near retirement.

This is, obviously, not possible, but it hasn't been a problem for Rubio in the GOP primary because the 2016 GOP primary — like the 2012, 2008, 2000, 1996, and 1988 primaries — haven't been about who has the best policy plans. It is about how conservative ideology should be defined and — among those who share a similar definition — who is its most effective champion. The 1980 and 1976 GOP primaries were about whether the Republican Party should be a vehicle of the conservative movement or whether it should continue in the Eisenhower/Nixon/Ford model of right-leaning interest group brokerage — with the conservatives winning in 1980 and never letting go.

Democrats for almost all of this time have not defined themselves as a mirror image of the conservative GOP. Instead, they are a left-leaning coalition of interest groups looking for group wins that tends to downplay ideology. This is why, historically, evaluating ""plans"" has been a very important part of Democratic politics.

Sanders's campaign against Hillary Clinton is more like Ronald Reagan's battle with Gerald Ford than like the Obama-Clinton primary of 2008. As part of his political revolution, Sanders wants to change the Democratic Party (which he historically was not even a member of) into a much more ideological political party. Consequently, for Sanders the point of taking policy positions is much more about showing where he stands and who his friends and enemies are than it is about the details of policymaking. What he would actually do as president, after all, is going to be constrained by political realities and his ability to mobilize the public

To Sanders's critics, of course, this is just gross irresponsibility that neglects the best traditions of the Democratic Party and raises serious questions about Sanders's ability to do serious policy analysis when the time comes to make choices. But to his fans, fetishizing wonky details is just a way of circumscribing policy proposals to what can be uncontroversially modeled in a world where obtaining and deploying concrete political power — not drawing up more and better white papers — is the crucial task for progressive politics.",www.vox.com,left,RXXIcl6jHpGxTeXc

What happened?,2015-09-07,Joseph Blasi,"On Labor Day , Americans celebrate the contributions of American workers and the rights that ensure their fair treatment . Protecting and extending these rights continues to be vitally important , but it ’ s time to add a new priority to the agendas of all who have workers ’ interests at heart : mechanisms for delivering labor ’ s fair share .
The core commitment of the American economy to give workers a fair share of the productivity and profits they have created is seriously in question . It has become abundantly clear over the last few years that the middle class is not sharing in the gains of the economy . Wages are mostly flat , and labor ’ s share of national income is declining as the productivity and profits of many businesses continue to expand . After decades of hoping to expand middle-class ownership of capital – stocks , bonds , access to profit-sharing and capital gains – during the late 20th century , it has been declining precipitously . Even worse , that is happening as the direct result of actual misguided government policies , even as other policies subsidize the concentration of that capital among the wealthy .
Ownership of capital , particularly through vehicles like grants of stock and stock options , and profit sharing was supposed to be a silver bullet for middle class success . And for a while it was developing . According to the General Social Survey , in 2002 , 21 percent of workers owned some stock in the company where they worked , over 13 percent had employee stock options , and about a third received cash profit sharing , and a quarter some gain sharing , which involves a share paid to workers of increased sales or better customer service .
Today , the reality is that after decades of productivity gains and stock market gains , for most workers , the amounts received from shares are relatively modest and really don ’ t add up to very much . The most common form of shares , profit sharing , is now the least meaningful . The median adult worker with profit sharing receives only $ 2,000 per year . The other 65 percent of workers without profit sharing receive zero . The median worker with gain sharing also receives $ 2,000 and the other 80 percent of workers without gain sharing receives zero . While almost half of all workers in the communications and computer services industries had stock options in 2002 and over a tenth of workers nationwide were receiving stock options the availability of stock options to middle class workers has sunk by more than a third nationwide and in America ’ s innovative industries . Moreover , the median worker owning company stock -- only a fifth of workers -- has employee stock ownership worth only $ 10,000 . The other 80 percent own nothing in their companies .
The principal explanation is not simply corporate greed or structural changes in the economy , but rather a long series of unfortunate government policies that have either eliminated or weakened share plans for the middle class , all while incentivizing policies that benefit the top . This privileged use of the tax system has to change .
Employee share ownership expanded in the 1980s and 1990s after the Reagan administration set up tax incentives to jumpstart broad-based employee stock ownership plans ( ESOPs ) in public stock market companies . This encouraged large corporations to make lower risk grants of their stock to workers with workers not purchasing the stock with their savings . The incentives allowed lenders to deduct a portion of their interest income when they made loans to corporations to finance purchases of stock that were later granted to middle class employees who often also received dividends . The major Wall Street investment banks even set up divisions to market such plans , and aggressively proposed broad-based employee ownership to corporations . In the budget cutting that swept the President George H.W . Bush Administrations , these incentives were almost completely eliminated .
Other policies began with good intentions , but ultimately undermined middle class shares . In 1993 , Congress sought to limit corporate tax deductions for the salaries of the top five executives in stock market companies to $ 1 million per executive . As this idea wound its way through Congress , the proposal was changed so that the deduction limit for the fixed salaries of executives was capped at $ 1 million , but stock market firms received virtually unlimited tax deductions for profit and equity sharing plans given to those top executives – now known as Section 162 ( m ) of the Internal Revenue Code .
As a result , executive shares have been subsidized by taxpayers with an estimated cost of at least $ 5- $ 10 billion a year since 1993 by six presidential administrations with largely unwavering bipartisan support . As top executives reap billions with Federal tax deductions , the tax deductions for share plans for middle class workers have much lower limits . On top of that , the tax mechanisms and encouragements for generous cash and deferred profit sharing plans have also been weakened over the past several decades for a number of reasons . While the Federal government has kept some tax benefits for Employee Stock Ownership Plans in closely-held companies intact , these benefits have yet to be updated to apply to millions of other closely-held companies called S corporations . And ESOPs and share plans of all kinds are simply not sufficiently encouraged by the Federal government in stock market companies .
Then , in response to the Enron and Worldcom scandals , the recent administration of President George W. Bush advanced accounting reforms of stock options designed to reduce the role of options in executive pay . As recently as 2002 , broad-based stock options were common , covering 57 percent of all workers in computer services , 43 percent of all workers in communications , 27 percent of all workers in financial services , and even 23 percent of all workers in the durable manufacturing industry .
By 2010 , after the Bush administration ’ s “ reform , ” the General Social Survey showed a 70 percent drop in workers in computer services receiving stock options , a 57 percent drop in durable manufacturing , a 45 percent drop in financial services , and an almost 20 percent drop in the communications industry . The decline in stock options was concentrated among middle class workers , while the top echelon was largely spared . This happened because companies pushed middle class workers and managers out of their stock option plans to reduce the accounting cost of their stock options plans so that the options for the executives could be kept largely intact . President Bush ’ s “ reform ” of stock options for executives ended up punishing the middle class , just as the earlier executive pay “ reform ” of the 1990s ended up subsidizing executive pay . The Bush Administration reforms also led to a huge drop in the very generous Employee Stock Purchase Plans whereby large corporations used to generously allow workers to buy stock at a 15 percent discount to market with other provisions that made them low risk . Maybe , as some critics point out , options are not the best way to pay workers , but similar equity plans should not be only for the top .
In short , Washington has quietly created a subsidized system of grants of free shares financially engineered mainly for the top echelon of the economy . Generous tax incentives encourage shares for the top , while zero or the least generous or out-of-date tax incentives are for middle class shares .
The country now needs a robust political discussion of shares for the middle class , and the ill-advised policies on middle class shares must be reversed . The first part of that discussion should be about risk to workers . Cash profit sharing , deferred profit sharing and gain sharing plans are the lowest-risk form of shares , so it was a reasonable place for the Clinton campaign to start . In addition to profit and gain sharing , corporate executives typically receive lower-risk grants of restricted stock or stock options . While many companies encourage executives to purchase some shares , these grants of equity make up most of their pay package , and the country needs policies that encourage these lower-risk forms of ownership for middle class workers as well . Let me be clear . I am against any policy encouraging workers to buy more than very modest amounts of company stock with their wages or retirement savings . As happened with Enron , workers can easily get over-invested in company stock they buy with their own wages . It should not be encouraged by Federal policy .
A responsible policy on equity shares would also give scaled progressive tax credits to corporations that grant equity to more than a majority of their workers without any worker purchases . If companies want large tax deductions for their executive share plans , they should be required to have share plans that cover all of their employees . Workers could share in the upside gain if the equity value of the firm increases over the long-term . Forms of employee share ownership such as grants of stock to workers through Employee Stock Ownership Plans ( ESOPs ) and other approaches , where workers do not buy the stock but the stock is financed by the company , are sensible to encourage . The elimination of ESOP incentives from the first Bush administration needs to be reversed so stock market companies and Wall Street start talking about equity grants to the middle class again . We need to revise federal policy to encourage firms that offer Employee Stock Purchase Plans a greater tax deduction for giving generous discounts to their employees with the level of the sales being reasonable capped to avoid undue risk . Beyond this , corporations that wish to receive many special corporate tax incentives should be required to have a fair broad-based profit-sharing plan or an employee share equity plan not based on worker purchases but only on grants , just as executive plans are structured . This Labor Day , it is time for the national discussion on wage stagnation to include a plan to revamp shares for the middle class .","On Labor Day, Americans celebrate the contributions of American workers and the rights that ensure their fair treatment.

He ’ s the former director of the Environmental Justice Resource Center at Clark Atlanta University . We ’ re reaching Dr. Bullard from his home in Houston , which he needs to evacuate later this morning due to the rising Brazos River .
Professor Bullard , thanks so much for being with us . Can you talk about the situation you ’ re in and so many people in Houston are in right now ? Describe the scene for us , and then how you relate it to your life ’ s work , to the issue of climate change and environmental justice .
ROBERT BULLARD : Well , good morning , and thanks for having me . Harvey and the aftermath , the flooding of Houston and the surrounding areas , it ’ s of biblical proportion . This is a nightmare . And the images that you see on television , and you hear the—you hear the voices of people who have been just totally destroyed . And this is a situation where I think it ’ s telling us that we have to change . We have to change the way we do business and the way that we , as humans , interact with our environment .
And this is basically the situation where this storm , this flooding of this city , tells us that there ’ s no place that ’ s immune from devastation . I worked , you know , in New Orleans in the flooding after Katrina . You know , New Orleans was only 500,000 people . Houston is 2.3 million people . And then you look at the surrounding areas . You ’ re talking 5.5 or almost 6 million people . And so you talk about this devastation . It is of historic proportion .
JUAN GONZÁLEZ : And , Dr. Bullard , to what degree do you think unchecked development by Houston ’ s officials over the past several decades has created an even worse possibility for calamity when a natural disaster like this hits ?
ROBERT BULLARD : Well , Houston is actually—was a catastrophe waiting to happen , given the fact you have unrestrained capitalism , no zoning , laissez-faire regulations when it comes to control of the very industries that have created lots of problems , when it comes to greenhouse gases and other industrial pollution , the impact that basically has been ignored for many years . And so , the fact that this is—you know , it is a disaster , but it ’ s a very predictable disaster .
And those communities that historically have borne the burden of environmental pollution and contamination from these many industries at the same time are the very communities that are bearing disproportionately the burden of this flooding . And so you get this pre-existing condition of inequality before the storm and this inequality in terms of how people are able to address this disaster because of vulnerability . And I think what we have to do is look at some lessons—well , not learn from Katrina in terms of the rebuilding , redevelopment and recovery .
JUAN GONZÁLEZ : And there ’ s been quite a bit of second-guessing of Mayor Sylvester Turner ’ s decision not to call for an evacuation of the city . I ’ m wondering your take on that , especially given what happened with Hurricane—was it Rita ? —a couple of years ago , when there was an evacuation effort made , but more people ended up dying , about a hundred people , in the gridlock that occurred as people tried to leave a city as large as Houston .
ROBERT BULLARD : Well , it ’ s easy to second-guess , but the fact is that trying to evacuate , you know , 2.3 million people on these highways is almost a task that ’ s impossible . And so , you know , I don ’ t think there was anything that you can say , “ Well , why is it that the mayor and the county judge decided to go this way ? ” You know , when you look at the problems of logistics and trying to move this many people on these highways getting out of the city , that probably was not a good choice to make .
And so I think the decision to have people shelter in place—and no one could predict , you know , what happened afterward . And so , I think the best that we can do now , instead of pointing fingers , is pointing to solutions and pointing to ways that we can address the many problems and challenges that we face today . And having to evacuate and leave your home and go out there and not know what ’ s ahead of you , and that you have your life—and I ’ m blessed—that when you see those images , you can see that this is pain .
And I think all governmental officials and governmental agencies and voluntary associations and civic groups and faith groups , we have to come together and make sure that we do what ’ s right , and not what ’ s politically expedient , but do what ’ s right and make sure that we build , you know , a just and healthy and sustainable city when we rebuild and when we recover . It has to be just .","This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

ROBERT BULLARD: Well, good morning, and thanks for having me. Harvey and the aftermath, the flooding of Houston and the surrounding areas, it’s of biblical proportion. This is a nightmare. And the images that you see on television, and you hear the—you hear the voices of people who have been just totally destroyed. And this is a situation where I think it’s telling us that we have to change. We have to change the way we do business and the way that we, as humans, interact with our environment.

And this is basically the situation where this storm, this flooding of this city, tells us that there’s no place that’s immune from devastation. I worked, you know, in New Orleans in the flooding after Katrina. You know, New Orleans was only 500,000 people. Houston is 2.3 million people. And then you look at the surrounding areas. You’re talking 5.5 or almost 6 million people. And so you talk about this devastation. It is of historic proportion.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Dr. Bullard, to what degree do you think unchecked development by Houston’s officials over the past several decades has created an even worse possibility for calamity when a natural disaster like this hits?

ROBERT BULLARD: Well, Houston is actually—was a catastrophe waiting to happen, given the fact you have unrestrained capitalism, no zoning, laissez-faire regulations when it comes to control of the very industries that have created lots of problems, when it comes to greenhouse gases and other industrial pollution, the impact that basically has been ignored for many years. And so, the fact that this is—you know, it is a disaster, but it’s a very predictable disaster.

And those communities that historically have borne the burden of environmental pollution and contamination from these many industries at the same time are the very communities that are bearing disproportionately the burden of this flooding. And so you get this pre-existing condition of inequality before the storm and this inequality in terms of how people are able to address this disaster because of vulnerability. And I think what we have to do is look at some lessons—well, not learn from Katrina in terms of the rebuilding, redevelopment and recovery.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And there’s been quite a bit of second-guessing of Mayor Sylvester Turner’s decision not to call for an evacuation of the city. I’m wondering your take on that, especially given what happened with Hurricane—was it Rita?—a couple of years ago, when there was an evacuation effort made, but more people ended up dying, about a hundred people, in the gridlock that occurred as people tried to leave a city as large as Houston.

ROBERT BULLARD: Well, it’s easy to second-guess, but the fact is that trying to evacuate, you know, 2.3 million people on these highways is almost a task that’s impossible. And so, you know, I don’t think there was anything that you can say, “Well, why is it that the mayor and the county judge decided to go this way?” You know, when you look at the problems of logistics and trying to move this many people on these highways getting out of the city, that probably was not a good choice to make.

And so I think the decision to have people shelter in place—and no one could predict, you know, what happened afterward. And so, I think the best that we can do now, instead of pointing fingers, is pointing to solutions and pointing to ways that we can address the many problems and challenges that we face today. And having to evacuate and leave your home and go out there and not know what’s ahead of you, and that you have your life—and I’m blessed—that when you see those images, you can see that this is pain.

And I think all governmental officials and governmental agencies and voluntary associations and civic groups and faith groups, we have to come together and make sure that we do what’s right, and not what’s politically expedient, but do what’s right and make sure that we build, you know, a just and healthy and sustainable city when we rebuild and when we recover. It has to be just.",www.democracynow.org,left,l2v9LuGE5chVsgLS

Part 2 Of The Martin O'Malley Interview Listen · 5:59 5:59

Martin O'Malley, former governor of Maryland, says he'll decide by late May whether he's running for president. Running would put him — even he seems to acknowledge — in an uphill battle against Hillary Clinton, currently the only Democrat who has declared.

O'Malley is positioning himself to Clinton's left, and even President Obama's left.

He's for a much higher minimum wage, and against a major trade deal — the Trans-Pacific Partnership. In an interview with NPR's Steve Inskeep, O'Malley also said he wants to increase Social Security benefits, even though some people would pay more taxes.

Surveys put O'Malley far behind Clinton. But, he's hoping his travels across the country can change that. Last month, he addressed a crowd in Iowa while standing on a chair. Last week, he gave a speech at Harvard. And this week, he's in the early primary state of South Carolina.

""I've been an executive and a progressive executive with a record of accomplishments,"" the former Baltimore mayor said of the difference between him and Clinton. ""I think contrasts will become apparent.""

(A full transcript of the discussion is available here.)

Interview Highlights

On Republicans' and Democrats' competing economic theories

I think what's going on right now, Steve, is you have a competition between two theories of how our economy actually works and how we generate economic growth that lifts us all. The Republican Party is doubling down on this trickle-down theory that says thou shalt concentrate wealth at the very top of our society. Thou shalt remove regulation from wherever you find it, even on Wall Street. And thou shalt keep wages low for American workers so that we can be more competitive. We have a different theory. Our theory as Democrats and as the longer arc of our story as Americans is that we believe that a stronger middle class is actually the cause of economic growth. What ails our economy right now is 12 years of stagnant or declining wages, and we need to fix this.

On Republican candidates' focus on economic opportunity

I mean, look, talk is cheap. And so there are two ways to go forward from here, and history shows this. One path is a sensible rebalancing that calls us back to our tried and true success story as the land of opportunity. The other is pitchforks.

There's, history affords no other paths. We're either going to sensibly rebalance and do the things that allow our middle class to grow, that expands opportunities and allows workers to earn more when they're working harder. Or, we're going to go down a very, very bad path.

On whether large corporations are able to deal with regulation better than small businesses



Oh, certainly. I mean, our tax code's been turned into Swiss cheese. And certainly the concentrated wealth and accumulated power and the systematic deregulation of Wall Street has led to this situation where the economy isn't working for most of us. All of that is true. But it is not true that regulation holds poor people down or regulation keeps middle class from advancing. That's kind of patently bulls- - -.

On the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal



Yeah, I do oppose it. What's wrong with it is first and foremost that we're not allowed to read it before our representatives vote on it. What's wrong with it is that right now what we should be doing are things that make our economy stronger here at home. And it's my concern that the Trans-Pacific Partnership, this deal is a race to the bottom, a chasing of lower wages abroad, and I believe that that does nothing to help us build a stronger economy here at home.",www.npr.org,center,Au6iGe0TjTF4LUzt

Now that Hillary Clinton has by default sewn up the Democratic nomination, expect Democrats to play the gender card for all it’s worth. Hillary recently lashed out at the Republican field for holding “extreme views about women, we expect from some of the terrorist groups but it’s a little hard to take from Republicans who want to be the president of the United States.”

So much for cleaning up the harsh partisan discourse in Washington.

Hillary’s “gender equity” agenda includes family leave legislation and a federal mandate requiring that women receive equal pay. This from a senator who from 2002 to 2008, paid her female staffers 72 cents for every dollar paid to males, or $15,708 less than the median salary for a man, according to an analysis of data from official Senate expenditure reports.

The strategy here is to try to continue to exploit the gender gap that widened in the past two presidential elections. In 2012 Barack Obama won 57 percent of the women’s vote. President Obama has done especially well with single women winning 66 percent in 2012.

But it may not work this time around and here’s why. Working women have gotten crushed under the weight of Obama policies. During Mr. Obama’s six and a half years in office women have suffered steeper declines in take home pay than men have. Women have also experienced sharper declines in employment and a faster rise in poverty. The financial squeeze has been especially severe for single women.

Last month the Census Bureau reported on income and poverty through 2014. It’s not a pretty picture. The median income household has lost nearly $1,300 in income after inflation under Obamanomics.

It’s worse for women. Since President Obama took office in 2009, median inflation-adjusted income for women has fallen by nearly 4 cents on the dollar, according to the Census data, versus slight gains for men.

On Mr. Obama’s watch, 2 million more women have slipped into poverty. Wait a minute. This is supposed to be an economic recovery. The poverty rate among women is now 16.1 percent — the highest level in 20 years.

The Great Recession was the main factor that plunged families into poverty, but poverty rates have failed to return to normal levels six years later. The poverty rate among single mothers of children under 18 (39.8 percent) is nearly double that of single fathers (22 percent) and that gap has widened under Mr. Obama’s reign.

It’s well known that labor force participation has fallen to its lowest level since 1978. What’s lesser known is that the biggest decline in employment has been among women. The female labor force participation rate is now 56.4 percent, the lowest in more than 25 years.

In the 1980s and ‘90s millions of women voluntarily entered the labor force and earned rising incomes. Over the last decade that progress has stalled out. An all-time high 57 million women over the age of 16 are out of the labor force today and not collecting a paycheck. All those Obama stimulus programs and more than $7 trillion of red ink added to the national debt, but hasn’t put women back to work.

Liberals counter that the gap between women’s wages and men’s wages has narrowed in the last five years. But the major explanation for this is that so many fewer women are in jobs now. Women who fall out of the workforce tend to be at the lower end of the income scale — so perversely, the gender gap appears to have fallen. This statistical illusion hides that for millions of women not able to find work under the Obama recovery, their earnings have fallen to zero.

There are a multitude of unforced policy errors that explain why the U.S. economy has pummeled workers. Mr. Obama has hobbled the economy with punitive tax rates, $7 trillion in new debt, minimum wage hikes, regulatory overreach, and Obamacare. Women have been the front-line victims of these failed policies.

What should give all of us pause — and especially women — is that if you listen closely to the policy ideas of Hillary Clinton and other Democrats, they sound very much like they are promising four more years of all this. That really would be a war against women.

Yellen , 67 , is committed to both sides of the Fed ’ s dual mandate to bolster job growth while keeping inflation in check , Obama said at the White House .
“ America ’ s workers and their families will have a champion in Janet Yellen , ” he said .
The president was flanked by Yellen and the current Fed chairman , Ben S. Bernanke , whose term expires on Jan. 31 , and who Obama lauded for helping guide the economy during the worst recession since the Great Depression .
Yellen , now the Fed ’ s vice chairman , said that more needs to be done to strengthen the recovery and that the Fed can promote employment growth while holding down inflation .
“ The mandate of the Federal Reserve is to serve all of the American people , ” Yellen said .
The nomination is subject to Senate confirmation and is being made as Obama and congressional Republicans seek an end to a stalemate over funding the government and raising the federal debt limit , which the Treasury Department said will be reached next week .
Key Democrats in the Senate , where the party holds a majority , predicted Yellen would easily win confirmation .
Optimism that Yellen won ’ t rush to withdraw stimulus helped push U.S. stocks higher after two days of declines . The Standard & Poor ’ s 500 Index gained almost 0.1 percent to 1,656.4 at 4:32 p.m. in New York after plunging 2.1 percent over the previous two sessions , its worst drop since June . Rates on Treasury bills due on Oct. 17 climbed 20 basis points to 0.475 percent , after jumping 14 basis points yesterday .
Bernanke , the Fed ’ s chairman since 2006 , has committed to staying through the end of his term even if Yellen is confirmed before then , according to a person familiar with his plans , who asked not to be identified in discussing private talks .
The president called Bernanke “ the epitome of calm ” during the 2008 financial crisis .
“ When faced with potential global economic meltdown , he has displayed tremendous courage and creativity , ” Obama said . “ I ’ m personally very grateful to you for being such a strong partner in helping America recover from recession . ”
The president ’ s decision to nominate Yellen followed a polarizing and unprecedented public contest for a nomination that Obama described in August as one of the most important decisions of his presidency . Yellen was the favorite in surveys of economists and had the backing of 20 members of the Senate Democratic caucus , who signed a July 26 letter to Obama .
Yellen became the leading candidate after former Treasury secretary and White House economic adviser Lawrence Summers withdrew from consideration last month amid opposition from Senate Democrats .
Bernanke ’ s predecessor , Alan Greenspan , the Fed chairman from 1987 to 2006 , released a statement calling Yellen “ an outstanding economist and policy maker . I wish her well as she tackles the tough challenges ahead . ”
Former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said Yellen “ has a terrific intellect and deep experience on monetary policy issues . ”
A member of the Fed ’ s Board of Governors and chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers during the Clinton administration , Yellen later was president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco before Obama nominated her to the No . 2 job at the Fed in 2010 .
Her nomination as Fed vice chairman passed the Senate Banking Committee with a vote of 17-6 , providing a preview of what her confirmation process may look like . There are 12 Democrats and 10 Republicans on the Banking Committee .
As a top deputy to Bernanke , Yellen supported the central bank ’ s unprecedented bond-buying programs and was a driving force behind a new strategy adopted in 2012 to commit the central bank to goals on inflation and unemployment .
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Johnson , a South Dakota Democrat , pledged to work “ to move her nomination forward in a timely manner , ” saying her depth of experience is unmatched .
New York Senator Charles Schumer , the chamber ’ s No . 3 Democrat , said he expected Yellen to be confirmed “ by a wide margin . ”","SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email

Optimism that Yellen won’t rush to withdraw stimulus helped push U.S. stocks higher after two days of declines. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained almost 0.1 percent to 1,656.4 at 4:32 p.m. in New York after plunging 2.1 percent over the previous two sessions, its worst drop since June. Rates on Treasury bills due on Oct. 17 climbed 20 basis points to 0.475 percent, after jumping 14 basis points yesterday.

Bernanke, the Fed’s chairman since 2006, has committed to staying through the end of his term even if Yellen is confirmed before then, according to a person familiar with his plans, who asked not to be identified in discussing private talks.

The president called Bernanke “the epitome of calm” during the 2008 financial crisis.

Lauding Bernanke

“When faced with potential global economic meltdown, he has displayed tremendous courage and creativity,” Obama said. “I’m personally very grateful to you for being such a strong partner in helping America recover from recession.”

The president’s decision to nominate Yellen followed a polarizing and unprecedented public contest for a nomination that Obama described in August as one of the most important decisions of his presidency. Yellen was the favorite in surveys of economists and had the backing of 20 members of the Senate Democratic caucus, who signed a July 26 letter to Obama.

Yellen became the leading candidate after former Treasury secretary and White House economic adviser Lawrence Summers withdrew from consideration last month amid opposition from Senate Democrats.

Bernanke’s predecessor, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman from 1987 to 2006, released a statement calling Yellen “an outstanding economist and policy maker. I wish her well as she tackles the tough challenges ahead.”

Former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said Yellen “has a terrific intellect and deep experience on monetary policy issues.”

Yellen’s Experience

A member of the Fed’s Board of Governors and chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers during the Clinton administration, Yellen later was president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco before Obama nominated her to the No. 2 job at the Fed in 2010.

Her nomination as Fed vice chairman passed the Senate Banking Committee with a vote of 17-6, providing a preview of what her confirmation process may look like. There are 12 Democrats and 10 Republicans on the Banking Committee.

As a top deputy to Bernanke, Yellen supported the central bank’s unprecedented bond-buying programs and was a driving force behind a new strategy adopted in 2012 to commit the central bank to goals on inflation and unemployment.

Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Johnson, a South Dakota Democrat, pledged to work “to move her nomination forward in a timely manner,” saying her depth of experience is unmatched.

New York Senator Charles Schumer, the chamber’s No. 3 Democrat, said he expected Yellen to be confirmed “by a wide margin.”",www.bloomberg.com,center,gqbQGfZTvLtraoQp

The goal of the Fed maneuvers is to spur on borrowing and spending by holding down long-term interest rates in hopes it will boost economic growth and reduce unemployment, which currently stands at 8.1 percent.

In announcing the decision, the Fed made clear that recent economic data are worrying the U.S. central bank and that it will continue its effort to boost growth until it becomes clear the economy is much stronger.

“To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens,” the Fed said in a statement following the end of a two-day meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee.

The Fed has been under increasing political scrutiny for the steps it has taken since the financial crisis to try to juice the economy with several Republicans charging it is going too far and some Democrats imploring it to do more.

Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and other Fed officials maintain politics does not influence their decisions but with the economy playing a central role in the presidential election the pressure on the central bank is unusually intense.

“We have tried very, very hard, and I think we’ve been successful, at the Federal Reserve to be nonpartisan and apolitical and make our decisions based entirely on the state of the economy,” Bernanke said at a news conference on Thursday.

Due to partisan gridlock, Congress has not taken significant steps to try to boost the economy this year, which leaves the Fed as the government body most able to take stimulative actions.

In a speech on Thursday, Rep. Scott Garrett (R-N.J.) argued that regardless of congressional inaction the Fed is going beyond its mandate and is treading on Congress’s turf.

We ’ ve just heard Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton frame her campaign launch around the notion that “ Everyday Americans need a champion , and I want to be that champion . ”
But before that , it ’ s also been Republicans sounding notes of alarm about the economic condition of ordinary Americans . Though best known in recent years for proposing broad tax cuts to promote economic growth , this time they are talking up the need for growth plus something more – rebuilding ladders of upward mobility .
Jeb Bush , an expected Republican candidate for president , recently lamented , “ Far too many Americans live on the edge of economic ruin. ” He also said that an urgent need for the nation is to “ restore America ’ s faith ... that any child born today can reach further than their parents . ”
Another prospective candidate on the right , Sen. Marco Rubio ( R ) of Florida , uses a new book , `` American Dreams : Restoring Economic Opportunity for Everyone '' to pitch a similar theme , echoing President Obama by calling saying stalled mobility is “ the central challenge of our time. ” ( Mr. Obama has used the word “ defining ” rather than “ central . ” )
The two parties differ in their diagnosis of the problem and on solutions . But to a considerable extent , they are singing from similar song sheet : They agree that ordinary Americans – call them “ working ” or “ middle-class ” or “ average ” – are financially strained and that the challenge merits some focused policy attention .
Jared Bernstein , an economist and former adviser to the Obama administration , says that basic consensus represents a significant step – paving the way for a vigorous policy debate between now and the election .

Why has the shift by politicians and others occurred ? Why , even though the 2016 hopefuls don ’ t want to sound like an Obama retread by using the phrase “ middle-class economics , ” is there such focus on precisely that ?
One is simply that the recovery from recession remains far from complete . Although the labor market has been improving steadily , the 5.5 percent official unemployment rate masks the fact that millions remain unemployed or underemployed . Some have dropped out of the labor force because of discouragement , while others hope to shift from part-time to full-time work . And many who have jobs are eager for better ones .
As a recent Monitor cover story reported , each month of solid job growth helps to work out these problems , but it ’ s been much more of a slog than after most recessions – putting strains on middle-class families .
A second factor is that , by some measures , the roots of middle-class anxiety go back decades . Upward mobility in America , in fact , has always been accompanied by financial risks as well as the reward of rising living standards . But since the early 1970s , Americans have seen an era of global dominance ( after World War II ) replaced by an era of widening global competition .
Worker compensation began rising at a slower pace than did workplace productivity . It hasn ’ t helped that , in the current recovery , wage growth has essentially stalled in inflation-adjusted terms .
The challenges facing typical US households shouldn ’ t be exaggerated . Some economists say the news media tend to overplay the widening of income inequality and the stagnation of middle-class incomes .
“ The majority of people think that they live better than their parents because they do , ” writes Stephen Rose in a 2014 report for the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation , a Washington research group . “ They can ’ t imagine doing without the new products and services that didn ’ t exist 30 years ago . ”
To Mr. Rose , now at George Washington University , a key point is that policymakers shouldn ’ t conclude that economic growth no longer benefits average workers – a conclusion that might steer the policy debate solely toward how to redistribute wealth from the rich to the rest .
His point is important , and it ’ s why you can expect candidates from both parties to talk about economic growth as part of the middle-class solution , not just about targeted policies on things like child care , retirement , or education . At the same time though , many presidential hopefuls appear set to also pitch ideas for spreading the fruits of growth more broadly . The targeted proposals could range from policies on education and retirement savings to an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit to encourage employment for low-income Americans .
Another reason for candidates to focus on middle-class concerns is public opinion – the feelings that go alongside the economic realities .

Facing questions from a Republican-led House oversight committee , Nicholas Whitcombe , a former Energy Department loan director , acknowledged Fisker failed to meet a February 2011 deadline for its $ 100,000 Karma hybrid . But the agency didn ’ t halt funding for the automaker until four months later .
He declined to answer questions about whether Fisker provided misleading information between those dates , saying only that the agency eventually took “ decisive action . ”
His testimony before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee followed the release of documents Monday that suggested Energy Department officials were aware of problems in spring 2010 – just months after Fisker was granted the $ 529 million loan in 2009 .
An April 2010 agency document listed milestones that Fisker had yet to meet . And in a June 2010 email , Energy Department loan official Sandra Claghorn wrote that Fisker `` may be in limbo due to a lack of compliance with financial covenants '' set up by the department to protect taxpayers in the event of default .
The agency later said the email had been taken out of context and the requisite documents were delivered five days later . And White House spokesman Jay Carney accused congressional Republicans of leaking the documents in an effort to embarrass the Obama administration .

Facing questions from a Republican-led House oversight committee, Nicholas Whitcombe, a former Energy Department loan director, acknowledged Fisker failed to meet a February 2011 deadline for its $100,000 Karma hybrid. But the agency didn’t halt funding for the automaker until four months later.

He declined to answer questions about whether Fisker provided misleading information between those dates, saying only that the agency eventually took “decisive action.”

His testimony before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee followed the release of documents Monday that suggested Energy Department officials were aware of problems in spring 2010 – just months after Fisker was granted the $529 million loan in 2009.

An April 2010 agency document listed milestones that Fisker had yet to meet. And in a June 2010 email, Energy Department loan official Sandra Claghorn wrote that Fisker ""may be in limbo due to a lack of compliance with financial covenants"" set up by the department to protect taxpayers in the event of default.

The agency later said the email had been taken out of context and the requisite documents were delivered five days later. And White House spokesman Jay Carney accused congressional Republicans of leaking the documents in an effort to embarrass the Obama administration.

Committee member Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., accused the agency of “stonewalling” requests for documents.

“Stop,” he said, cutting off Whitcombe. “You don’t determine what we need. You comply with what (the request) says.”

Trump ’ s speech , optimistic and pro-American as it was , falls in the mainstream of American presidential tradition . Indeed , it is the stuff of a Truman or a Reagan .
But you ’ d never know it from how it was reported .
That is a more apt description for The Guardian itself . ( Trust me , I know . I ’ ve been trashed by them no less than twice for a claim I never made and they never bothered to verify . )
Salon said Trump “ careened wildly from some warped form of principled realism to threats of mass annihilation and back again . ”
The people who believe in the naïve , unworkable , utopian ideology of socialism no longer live in Beijing , Moscow , or Hanoi . On the contrary , socialism ’ s modern advocates reside in such places as London , Paris , Brussels , Berlin , and , increasingly , Washington .
Perhaps Salon , careening wildly from one Trump attack-piece to another , is unaware of the fact that America has been threatened with “ mass annihilation ” by a declared enemy with an increasing capability to do it . Someone should tell them .
Slate characterized it as “ the most hostile , dangerous , and intellectually confused—if not outright dishonest—speech ever delivered by an American president to an international body . ”
We live in an age of hyperbole and this is an excellent example of it . I encourage you to read the full text of Trump ’ s speech and decide for yourself if it was “ the most hostile , dangerous … speech ever ” or if this is the worst reporting in the history of human civilization . Ever .
Then there is John Haltiwanger ’ s article in Newsweek titled , “ Trump was laughed at by world leaders for dissing socialism . ”
This column caught my attention both for its content and lack of content . The title alone intrigued me—as good titles are supposed to do—but for all the wrong reasons . I mean , really ? I know we live in the age of 24/7/365 news cycles and the hunger for fresh web content is relentless , but has Newsweek sunk so low that an article that feels like dialogue lifted from the script of `` Mean Girls '' is now counted as serious journalism ?
As the title indicates , his critique of Trump ’ s speech centers on the president ’ s “ dissing ” of socialism . Haltiwanger writes :
When President Donald Trump criticized socialism during his speech Tuesday at the United Nations , he seemed to expect roaring approval from the audience . Instead , world leaders responded with laughter and weak applause . It was perhaps the most awkward moment of Trump ’ s speech .
Speaking on the recent crisis in Venezuela , Trump said , “ The problem ... is not that socialism has been poorly implemented but that socialism has been faithfully implemented . ”
“ From the Soviet Union to Cuba to Venezuela , wherever true socialism or communism has been adopted , it has delivered anguish and devastation and failure , ” Trump added .
In the middle of his comments , Trump paused to take the room ’ s temperature , but it was apparent world leaders were unmoved by the rebuke of the worker state . The room was silent . It was reminiscent of Jeb Bush ’ s “ please clap ” moment… . Video of the [ president ’ s ] speech has immortalized the uncomfortable moment .
That Trump would do such a thing is , for Haltiwanger , evidence of the president ’ s buffoonery , lack of sophistication , and his failure to properly read “ the room ’ s temperature . ”
He includes a screenshot of a tweet from someone named Jordan , which reads , “ The # UNGA [ United Nations General Assembly ] just LAUGHED at Trump for criticizing socialism . ”
I laughed at Mr. Haltiwanger ’ s article , but this is no proof that it is logically flawed ( though logically flawed it is ) . The Left has always been overly sensitive to what the world thinks of America and its president . They need global affirmation , it seems . Obama was , for them , urbane , glamorous , “ a gentleman , ” as an acquaintance at the New York Times has often characterized him to me , as if these are defining characteristics of great national leaders .
By contrast , Trump is , for them , a national embarrassment with his comb-over , trademark scowl , and unfashionable patriotism . How are we to stand toe-to-toe with France and Canada when they have socialist beefcakes like Macron and Trudeau ? Winston Churchill , who was neither a gentleman nor glamorous—and whose scowl was likewise perpetual—seems to have worked out rather well as Prime Minister . Moreover , Churchill biographer Paul Reid has said that Churchill , ever a reactionary , “ would out-tweet Trump . ”
Furthermore , it is highly unlikely that Trump expected , as Haltiwanger maintains , “ roaring approval from the audience. ” According to a 2015 Freedom House study of 195 nations—and , at the moment , there are precisely 195 nations in the world—only 46 percent of them are deemed free . Worse , that same report says the world is trending away from freedom -- 193 of the countries included in this report are member states of the United Nations , North Korea and Venezuela among them . Trump “ seemed to expect roaring approval ” ? Please . Ann Coulter will sooner get applause at Berkeley than Trump before such an audience as this one .
Of course , the reason the author tells us that UN “ leaders responded with laughter and weak applause ” is because he is , in the spirit of an adolescent , inviting us to join in the mockery and scorn of this president .
Mr. Haltiwanger , who is clearly infatuated with the undeliverable promises of socialism , concludes his argument with what he apparently thinks is his article ’ s mic-drop moment , proving once and for all that socialism works and that Trump is an idiot for thinking otherwise :
Most industrialized countries , for example , have implemented universal health care . Moreover , Norway was recently ranked the happiest country in the world , and it pointed to its strong state-support programs as crucial to achieving this accolade… . Several other Scandinavian countries , including Denmark , Iceland and Sweden , were also among the top 10 happiest countries in the world , according to the most recent figures… . The U.S. , however , ca n't even make it into the top 10 happiest countries . It ’ s ranked at No . 14 .
Let ’ s drill down on this a bit and the inference that socialism is the reason for it . Norway ’ s designation as the “ world ’ s happiest country ” is based on a United Nations report . You might think that this ranking comes from simple “ yes ” or “ no ” responses to the question , “ Are you happy ? ” It isn ’ t . That is essentially what Gallup did and guess who dominated the top ten ? Paraguay and Latin America . Neither Iceland nor a single Scandinavian country appeared in Gallup ’ s top ten .
So how did the guys at the UN produce entirely different results ? After spending an afternoon reading the UN report , that is still is unclear to me . This is because their study is 184 pages of abstruse data and reads like this :
The U.S. corruption index rose by 0.10 between 2006/7 and 2015/6 . With a coefficient -0.53 in the happiness regression , the negative effect on U.S. happiness is 0.054 . Reversing the rise in perceived corruption would therefore raise happiness by 0.054… .
Drilling down still more , we find that this report , as with any UN report I ’ ve ever read , has a very definite political agenda . It concludes :
To escape this social quagmire , America ’ s happiness agenda should center on … an expanded social safety net , wealth taxes , and greater public financing of health and education… . [ A ] cknowledge and move past the fear created by 9/11 … Trump ’ s ban on travel to the United States from certain Muslim-majority countries is a continuing manifestation of the exaggerated and irrational fears that grip the nation .
So , from a haze of data on global happiness the report makes the illogical leap to America , Donald Trump , and the lack of “ a social safety net ” —i.e. , lack of socialism—as the sources of unhappiness ? They could have saved themselves time , money , and the clever use of dubious statistics and just interviewed Maxine Waters—or Kim Jong Un .
Should we really be surprised that the UN , the body that commissioned this report , didn ’ t like Trump ’ s speech ?
As for the myth that Iceland and Scandinavia are socialist utopias , it is interesting to note that these countries rank highest in the use of antidepressants . Iceland holds the top spot while Denmark , Sweden , and Norway are all in the top ten . It seems they rank high because they are , well , high .
While speaking at Harvard ’ s Kennedy School of Government , Danish Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen rejected the idea that his country is socialist even though it has a much larger social welfare system : “ I know that some people in the U.S. associate the Nordic model with some sort of socialism . Therefore , I would like to make one thing clear . Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy . Denmark is a market economy . ”
I am currently going around the world investigating the question of national greatness . In the last month , I have been in Japan , Singapore , and China . Traveling across Asia , you quickly discover that no one outside of Pyongyang has faith in the tenets of Marx and Lenin anymore . Not even China is truly socialistic . That is because they know socialism doesn ’ t work .
No , the people who believe in that naïve , unworkable , utopian ideology no longer live in Beijing , Moscow , or Hanoi . On the contrary , socialism ’ s modern advocates reside in such places as London , Paris , Brussels , Berlin , and , increasingly , Washington .
Since we are using happiness as an indicator of socialism ’ s emotional influence , let ’ s look at Gallup ’ s least happy country : Ukraine . I ’ ve spent a lot of time in that country . Indeed , I ’ ve written a book on it , and I can tell you that Ukraine has been economically , intellectually , and spiritually assassinated by socialism . Five more socialist ( or formerly socialist ) countries make Gallup ’ s bottom ten .
Trump is right to say that “ wherever true socialism or communism has been adopted , it has delivered anguish and devastation and failure . ”
The failure of socialism is a wholly unjustified confidence in human government . It is , as Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky observed long ago , “ the tower of Babel built without God , not to mount to Heaven from earth , but to set up Heaven on earth . ”","On Tuesday, President Trump addressed the United Nations and, shocking to no one savelLeft-of-center news agencies, he expressed his strong belief in his own economic policies; in America—its people, way of life, and the Constitution which governs it; and in business enterprise as a path to freedom and prosperity. Trump’s speech, optimistic and pro-American as it was, falls in the mainstream of American presidential tradition. Indeed, it is the stuff of a Truman or a Reagan.

But you’d never know it from how it was reported.

The Guardian called it “a blunt, fearful rant.”

That is a more apt description for The Guardian itself. (Trust me, I know. I’ve been trashed by them no less than twice for a claim I never made and they never bothered to verify.)

Salon said Trump “careened wildly from some warped form of principled realism to threats of mass annihilation and back again.”

Let’s consider Mr. Haltiwanger’s argument, such as it is.

As the title indicates, his critique of Trump’s speech centers on the president’s “dissing” of socialism. Haltiwanger writes:

When President Donald Trump criticized socialism during his speech Tuesday at the United Nations, he seemed to expect roaring approval from the audience. Instead, world leaders responded with laughter and weak applause. It was perhaps the most awkward moment of Trump’s speech.

“From the Soviet Union to Cuba to Venezuela, wherever true socialism or communism has been adopted, it has delivered anguish and devastation and failure,” Trump added.

In the middle of his comments, Trump paused to take the room’s temperature, but it was apparent world leaders were unmoved by the rebuke of the worker state. The room was silent. It was reminiscent of Jeb Bush’s “please clap” moment…. Video of the [president’s] speech has immortalized the uncomfortable moment.

That Trump would do such a thing is, for Haltiwanger, evidence of the president’s buffoonery, lack of sophistication, and his failure to properly read “the room’s temperature.”

He includes a screenshot of a tweet from someone named Jordan, which reads, “The #UNGA [United Nations General Assembly] just LAUGHED at Trump for criticizing socialism.”

So what?

I laughed at Mr. Haltiwanger’s article, but this is no proof that it is logically flawed (though logically flawed it is). The Left has always been overly sensitive to what the world thinks of America and its president. They need global affirmation, it seems. Obama was, for them, urbane, glamorous, “a gentleman,” as an acquaintance at the New York Times has often characterized him to me, as if these are defining characteristics of great national leaders.

By contrast, Trump is, for them, a national embarrassment with his comb-over, trademark scowl, and unfashionable patriotism. How are we to stand toe-to-toe with France and Canada when they have socialist beefcakes like Macron and Trudeau? Winston Churchill, who was neither a gentleman nor glamorous—and whose scowl was likewise perpetual—seems to have worked out rather well as Prime Minister. Moreover, Churchill biographer Paul Reid has said that Churchill, ever a reactionary, “would out-tweet Trump.”

Furthermore, it is highly unlikely that Trump expected, as Haltiwanger maintains, “roaring approval from the audience.” According to a 2015 Freedom House study of 195 nations—and, at the moment, there are precisely 195 nations in the world—only 46 percent of them are deemed free. Worse, that same report says the world is trending away from freedom -- 193 of the countries included in this report are member states of the United Nations, North Korea and Venezuela among them. Trump “seemed to expect roaring approval”? Please. Ann Coulter will sooner get applause at Berkeley than Trump before such an audience as this one.

Of course, the reason the author tells us that UN “leaders responded with laughter and weak applause” is because he is, in the spirit of an adolescent, inviting us to join in the mockery and scorn of this president.

Mr. Haltiwanger, who is clearly infatuated with the undeliverable promises of socialism, concludes his argument with what he apparently thinks is his article’s mic-drop moment, proving once and for all that socialism works and that Trump is an idiot for thinking otherwise:

The U.S., however, can't even make it into the top 10 happiest countries. It’s ranked at No. 14.

Icelandic and Scandinavian happiness.

Let’s drill down on this a bit and the inference that socialism is the reason for it. Norway’s designation as the “world’s happiest country” is based on a United Nations report. You might think that this ranking comes from simple “yes” or “no” responses to the question, “Are you happy?” It isn’t. That is essentially what Gallup did and guess who dominated the top ten? Paraguay and Latin America. Neither Iceland nor a single Scandinavian country appeared in Gallup’s top ten.

So how did the guys at the UN produce entirely different results? After spending an afternoon reading the UN report, that is still is unclear to me. This is because their study is 184 pages of abstruse data and reads like this:

Drilling down still more, we find that this report, as with any UN report I’ve ever read, has a very definite political agenda. It concludes:

[A]cknowledge and move past the fear created by 9/11 … Trump’s ban on travel to the United States from certain Muslim-majority countries is a continuing manifestation of the exaggerated and irrational fears that grip the nation.

They could have saved themselves time, money, and the clever use of dubious statistics and just interviewed Maxine Waters—or Kim Jong Un.

No, the people who believe in that naïve, unworkable, utopian ideology no longer live in Beijing, Moscow, or Hanoi. On the contrary, socialism’s modern advocates reside in such places as London, Paris, Brussels, Berlin, and, increasingly, Washington.

Since we are using happiness as an indicator of socialism’s emotional influence, let’s look at Gallup’s least happy country: Ukraine. I’ve spent a lot of time in that country. Indeed, I’ve written a book on it, and I can tell you that Ukraine has been economically, intellectually, and spiritually assassinated by socialism. Five more socialist (or formerly socialist) countries make Gallup’s bottom ten.

Trump is right to say that “wherever true socialism or communism has been adopted, it has delivered anguish and devastation and failure.”

The failure of socialism is a wholly unjustified confidence in human government. It is, as Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky observed long ago, “the tower of Babel built without God, not to mount to Heaven from earth, but to set up Heaven on earth.”",www.foxnews.com,right,eN6deSupTYOYqarc

Promising to address inequality and strengthen the middle class, President Obama’s State of the Union address combined sound and foolish proposals, laced with good, old-fashioned demagoguery.

Despite nearly five years of economic recovery, the fortunes of working Americans have decidedly worsened. The president’s policies should carry considerable culpability and bear correction.

Instead, he pronounced that upward mobility has stalled—when non-partisan economic studies show that’s not true—and insisted the wealthy should pay to balance the accounts.

[pullquote]

Thanks to the president’s free-trade policies, multinational corporations and talented Americans have earned huge income gains selling know how and services around the globe. Meanwhile, the stuff ordinary Americans make is increasingly shut out of the fastest-growing overseas markets.

GM boasts some of the best-selling cars in China, but high tariffs, regulations and an artificially cheap currency compel it to produce the vehicles there. The president refuses to effectively confront protectionism throughout Asia, denying Americans good-paying jobs.

ObamaCare is driving up health insurance costs. Along with higher taxes, that curbs domestic purchases, slows economic recovery and destroys jobs. Restrictions on offshore petroleum development, costly new banking and environmental regulations and a shortage of lending by regional banks make it tougher for small businesses to expand and add employees.

No surprise, some 20 million Americans can’t find full-time work, and the inflation-adjusted wages of ordinary workers are falling. Factoring in higher state and local taxes, most families are much worse off than five years ago, and record numbers of Americans depend on food stamps.

Now Obama wants to double down on failed initiatives. Instead of asking Congress to suspend the mandate that all Americans obtain excessive and expensive health insurance, he is launching an aggressive campaign to persuade young Americans to buy overpriced policies.

Presidential proposals to build a national network of manufacturing innovation centers, strengthen infrastructure, federal job training and R&D, and rapidly expand industrial use of clean natural gas have great merit. Yet, no matter how strong the products and productive their workers, America’s factories need more customers at home and abroad to succeed, grow and raise wages.

Unfortunately, the president proposes to push forward with new trade agreements in Asia that will further open U.S. markets to foreign competition without getting adequately enforceable concessions on discriminatory regulations and currency manipulation that keep out American products and impoverish once-proud U.S. blue-collar workers.

He wants Congress to approve a minimum wage of $10.10 an hour. That’s a 39 percent jump, and hardly justified by the 9 percent inflation since the federal floor was set in July 2009. Such an increase would compel McDonald’s to aggressively implement methods to cut employees. Smaller restaurants whose customers simply cannot afford to pay another $2 for lunch would close, and the same would in other industries.

Comprehensive immigration reform would help. Bringing undocumented workers out of the shadows would raise the wages they command, and those of citizens competing with them.

Republicans in Congress want a deal that really secures our borders from another surge of illegal immigrants. However, given the president’s poor record of sticking to his word in budget negotiations, critical members like Senator Marco Rubio are reluctant to trust him.

All this illustrates the central reason for Washington’s inaction on crucial issues.

The president dodges responsibility for the failures of his ideological agenda by asking Congress to tax the “one percent” for simply exploiting conditions he created.

Americans judge the president by their own deteriorating conditions, and his credibility on economic issues is falling precipitously.

Did America ’ s free market economists help put a protectionist demagogue in the White House ? By Michael Hirsh
Paul Krugman has never suffered fools gladly . The Nobel Prize-winning economist rose to international fame—and a coveted space on the New York Times op-ed page—by lacerating his intellectual opponents in the most withering way . In a series of books and articles beginning in the 1990s , Krugman branded just about everybody who questioned the rapid pace of globalization a fool who didn ’ t understand economics very well . “ Silly ” was a word Krugman used a lot to describe pundits who raised fears of economic competition from other nations , especially China . Don ’ t worry about it , he said : Free trade will have only minor impact on your prosperity . Now Krugman has come out and admitted , offhandedly , that his own understanding of economics has been seriously deficient as well . In a recent essay titled “ What Economists ( Including Me ) Got Wrong About Globalization , ” adapted from a forthcoming book on inequality , Krugman writes that he and other mainstream economists “ missed a crucial part of the story ” in failing to realize that globalization would lead to “ hyperglobalization ” and huge economic and social upheaval , particularly of the industrial middle class in America . And many of these working-class communities have been hit hard by Chinese competition , which economists made a “ major mistake ” in underestimating , Krugman says . ABOUT THE AUTHOR
Michael Hirsh is a senior correspondent and deputy news editor at ███ . Twitter : @ michaelphirsh . It was quite a “ whoops ” moment , considering all the ruined American communities and displaced millions of workers we ’ ve seen in the interim . And a newly humbled Krugman must consider an even more disturbing idea : Did he and other mainstream economists help put a protectionist populist , Donald Trump , in the White House with a lot of bad advice about free markets ? To be fair , Krugman has been forthright in recent years in second-guessing his earlier assertions about the effects of open trade . He has also become a leading and sometimes harsh critic of his own profession , especially in the aftermath of the financial crisis and Great Recession , when he declared that much of the past 30 years of macroeconomics was “ spectacularly useless at best , and positively harmful at worst. ” He admirably held the Obama administration to account for its timid financial and economic reforms . He even had some kind things to say about proto-progressives such as Robert Reich , the former Clinton administration labor secretary who worried about global competition and sought better protections and retraining for American workers , and whom Krugman had once dismissed to me—back in his lacerating days in the ’ 90s—as an “ offensive figure , a brilliant coiner of one-liners but not a serious thinker. ” “ I ’ m glad he ’ s finally seen the light on trade , ” Reich told me in an email . Krugman , in another email , wrote : “ I regret having said that about Reich , but if he foresaw hyperglobalization or the localized effects of the China shock , that ’ s news to me . ”
“ I ’ m glad he ’ s finally seen the light on trade , ” former Clinton administration labor secretary Robert Reich told me in an email .
Yet it has taken an awful long time for economists to admit that their profession has been far too sure of itself—or , as a penitent Krugman put it himself in a 2009 article in the New York Times Magazine , that “ economists , as a group , mistook beauty , clad in impressive-looking mathematics , for truth. ” As the journalist Binyamin Appelbaum writes in his new book , The Economists ’ Hour : False Prophets , Free Markets , and the Fracture of Society , economists came to dominate policymaking in Washington in a way they never had before and , starting in the late 1960s , seriously misled the nation , helping to disrupt and divide it socially with a false sense of scientific certainty about the wonders of free markets . The economists pushed efficiency at all costs at the expense of social welfare and “ subsumed the interests of Americans as producers to the interests of Americans as consumers , trading well-paid jobs for low-cost electronics. ” David Autor , an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) whose documentation of the surprising effects of China ’ s rapid rise on the U.S. labor market is cited by Krugman in his new essay , gives the Times columnist a lot of credit for admitting error . “ How rare is that ? ! ” Autor wrote via email . He said he doesn ’ t blame Krugman or other defenders of “ the prior consensus ” for making faulty predictions about trade . “ I honestly think that getting this one right ex ante would have been akin to accurately forecasting the date , time and location of an earthquake. ” The bigger problem was the pro-free trade zeitgeist , Autor said . “ I think that the received wisdom inhibited economists from closely evaluating the evidence of what was underway . … One could say that there was something of a guild orthodoxy : The key dictum was that policymakers should be told that trade was good for everyone in all places and times. ” Dani Rodrik , a Harvard University economist who in 1997 published a then-heretical book called Has Globalization Gone Too Far ? , said last week that he wrote it precisely because he believed that “ the profession was so blasé about globalization. ” Now his views are mainstream , and Rodrik is president-elect of the International Economic Association . But the economists have barely begun to clean up the mess they left behind , as a conference on inequality at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington , organized by Rodrik and former International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) chief economist Olivier Blanchard , made clear last week . And now in some ways it ’ s too late because , as Rodrik says , it ’ s not even possible to have a reasonable discussion under Trump . The U.S. president has effectively discarded modern economics , reembraced crude protectionism , and , like the mercantilists of the pre-Adam Smith era , appears to see trade as a zero-sum game in which surpluses are in effect profits and deficits are losses . His ignorance of basic economics “ is without parallel among modern American presidents , ” Appelbaum writes in The Economists ’ Hour .
Krugman played a major part in attacking what he saw as economic ignorance by “ strategic traders ” who argued that U.S. jobs and wages might be seriously affected by cheap labor from the developing world .
Yet Trump has been able to launch an unprecedented trade war , exploiting the public ’ s mistrust and fear of China , thanks in part to the economists ’ early misreadings—specifically of how swiftly China ’ s economic surge would displace so many U.S. industrial jobs . As Krugman now acknowledges , “ manufacturing employment fell off a cliff after 2000 , and this decline corresponded to a sharp increase ” in the U.S. trade deficit , especially with China . Those numbers , in turn , have tended to lend credence to Trump ’ s mercantilist notions , no matter how spurious . “ One of the most perverse effects of Trump was that it completely erased any reasonable discussion ” about how to address trade , inequality , and the right degree of protection for workers , Rodrik said . And this , too , is a downstream effect of the bad advice economists delivered about free trade going back to the ’ 90s . Or as MIT ’ s Autor put it : “ Ultimately this policy boosterism blinded policymakers to the potentially grave consequences of trade shocks and likely lulled us into underpreparing for these shocks ( e.g. , we had a paltry safety net and retraining policies on hand ) . It led us somewhat blithely into a non-negligible policy disaster ( AKA the China Shock ) and provoked a public backlash that has rendered free trade toxic in the U.S. policy debate . There ’ s an irony for you : trade boosterism has ultimately hurt the cause of free trade. ” Asked whether the mistakes made by him and other economists helped lead to the rise of Trump , Krugman responded : “ We ’ re still debating this , but as far as I can tell Trump ’ s trade policy isn ’ t resonating with many people , even his blue-collar base . So it ’ s kind of hard to blame trade analysts for the phenomenon . ”
Others would disagree . Part of the problem is that , back in the ’ 90s , when the post-Cold War consensus was just emerging , economists tended to take a simplistic either-or view of trade—either you were a free trader or a protectionist—and forced people to choose sides . Krugman was one of them , adopting by and large the free trade position , which was ironic considering that his Nobel-winning work in economics was far more nuanced than his books and columns ( and actually helped lay the intellectual foundations for smart strategic trade policy ) . Yet there were others in the policy debates—such as Rodrik , Reich , and Laura D ’ Andrea Tyson , who led former President Bill Clinton ’ s Council of Economic Advisers—who were far more worried about rapid globalization . They dared to question the pro-free trade consensus or at least , in Tyson ’ s case , to push for government-led industrial policy that would sharpen American competitiveness at a time when , after the Cold War , many newly liberalized nations were piling into the global economy at a great rate . This idea also was anathema to Krugman . “ Dani was way ahead of his time , ” Autor said . “ He was worried not about sudden shocks per se but about the way that globalization hemmed in the policy options of open economies ( options for financing social insurance , taxing increasingly mobile capital , etc ) . That was and is a deep point . … Meanwhile , Laura Tyson was advocating forward-looking industrial policy at a time when industrial policy was the Voldemort of policy tools. ” Those who have studied Krugman ’ s work closely , like Autor , say that of course he understood that just the right kind of industrial policy could help build competitive sectors . But Autor added : “ I suspect that economists feared that stating these points aloud to policymakers would be like handing a loaded weapon to a impetuous child . ”
Those who advocated anything resembling government interference in markets and “ fair trade ” ( more tariffs , unemployment insurance , and worker protections ) over “ free trade ” were usually branded protectionists and excluded from the debate .
Krugman maintains that his new mea culpa “ was a fairly narrow one ” about how trade would affect lower-wage workers and exacerbate inequality . That is true . But after the Cold War ended , the debate over trade ( Krugman ’ s Nobel-winning specialty ) became a proxy for a larger intellectual struggle over free markets versus government intervention . And Krugman played a major part in attacking what he saw as economic ignorance by “ strategic traders ” who argued that U.S. jobs and wages might be seriously affected by competition from cheap labor in the developing world . When William Greider , the former Washington Post journalist , warned in a deeply reported book called One World , Ready or Not : The Manic Logic of Global Capitalism that developing nations were gearing up for major industrial competition that would mean “ [ s ] ome sectors of Americans are triumphant and other sectors are devastated , ” Krugman called it a “ thoroughly silly book. ” When Michael Lind , another prominent public intellectual , suggested ( accurately ) that U.S. productivity growth might not be enough to offset “ the global sweatshop economy , ” Krugman declared Lind to be ignorant of economic “ facts ” and said that “ one should not expect someone who does not work in the field to be able to get it right without some guidance. ” Krugman was no less kind to fellow economists who dared to question the free trade consensus . When Tyson was chosen to head Clinton ’ s Council of Economic Advisers in 1993 , Krugman said she lacked the “ necessary analytical skills. ” It was all just bad economics , Krugman said . Don ’ t worry so much about what all the other countries are up to ; things will even out thanks to neoclassical concepts such as comparative advantage , which allows all nations to benefit from open trade . Indeed , those who advocated anything resembling government interference in markets and “ fair trade ” ( more tariffs , unemployment insurance , and worker protections ) over “ free trade ” were usually branded protectionists and excluded from the debate . Clinton , reveling in his reputation as the “ globalization ” president , barely held a meeting on the fate of the industrially displaced . When his old Rhodes Scholar pal from the University of Oxford , Labor Secretary Reich , openly advocated reinvestment in education , training , and infrastructure at a time when Clinton was keen on deficit-cutting , Reich was also edged out of the conversation and , eventually , the administration . Some ex-Clintonites such as Gene Sperling , the former head of the National Economic Council , argue that the debate was never so stark . “ Clinton cared about the middle class , ” he told me . And had the Democrats continued in power , they would have worked much harder to bring China into compliance with trade norms , for example by enforcing “ anti-surge ” protections—required of China as part of its World Trade Organization membership negotiated by Clinton in 1999—against the dumping of huge amounts of cheap product that undercut U.S. jobs , Sperling said . “ People think that the only difference with Al Gore [ in the 2000 presidential election ] was the Iraq War , but another huge difference would have been that Gore would have gone way beyond anything [ George W. ] Bush did to protect manufacturing , ” Sperling said . ( A new book by the former Washington Post economics reporter Paul Blustein , Schism : China , America , and the Fracturing of the Global Trading System , also concludes that the Bush administration let China get away with far too much , including artificially devaluing its currency to boost exports—which led ultimately to Trump ’ s claim that China had committed “ rape ” of the U.S . economy . ) Other former Krugman victims still blame him for his misjudgments and are not so assuaged by his penitence . “ This is not bad as mea culpas go , but if you read through to the end , Krugman persists with the oversimplified dichotomy of free trade versus protectionism , ignoring such successful hybrids as East Asian neo-mercantilism , ” said Robert Kuttner , the co-editor of the American Prospect and a much-cited progressive thinker . “ This is all the more bizarre because the young Krugman came to prominence demonstrating that [ national ] competitive advantage could be created , something that any non-economist student of economic history could have told him. ” Krugman , in his defense , has always believed in protections for the middle class , including better health care and education ( his old Times blog was titled “ The Conscience of a Liberal ” ) , and he says now that just because he has admitted errors on trade doesn ’ t mean he ever endorsed the so-called Washington Consensus—the neoliberal ( that is , pro-free trade ) view that regularly came down on the side of fiscal discipline , rapid privatization , and deregulation . “ I guess the point is that conceding that we got some things wrong doesn ’ t mean that every critic was right ; it depends on what they said , and as far as I know almost nobody foresaw the massive rise in trade or focused at all on localized regional impacts , ” Krugman told me last week . But there were deeper conceptual problems with the pro-globalization consensus as well . Another Nobel-winning economist , Joseph Stiglitz , who like Rodrik warned back in the ’ 90s of the disruptive effects of too rapid lowering of trade and capital barriers , told me that the problem with “ standard neoclassical analysis ” was that it “ never paid any attention to adjustment . Labor market adjustment miraculously happened costlessly. ” Like Tyson and Reich , Stiglitz , who served as a chair of Clinton ’ s Council of Economic Advisers , was an outlier at the time , seeking ( but failing ) to slow the pace of international capital flows . He also argued that “ typically jobs were destroyed far faster than new jobs were created. ” Krugman , in his new essay , admits that the economists like him in favor of the ’ 90s consensus behind free trade—who thought that the effects on labor would be minimal— “ didn ’ t turn much to analytic methods that focus on workers in particular industries and communities , which would have given a better picture of short-run trends .

Paul Krugman and other mainstream trade experts are now admitting that they were wrong about globalization: It hurt American workers far more than they thought it would. Did America’s free market economists help put a protectionist demagogue in the White House? By Michael Hirsh

Paul Krugman has never suffered fools gladly. The Nobel Prize-winning economist rose to international fame—and a coveted space on the New York Times op-ed page—by lacerating his intellectual opponents in the most withering way. In a series of books and articles beginning in the 1990s, Krugman branded just about everybody who questioned the rapid pace of globalization a fool who didn’t understand economics very well. “Silly” was a word Krugman used a lot to describe pundits who raised fears of economic competition from other nations, especially China. Don’t worry about it, he said: Free trade will have only minor impact on your prosperity. Now Krugman has come out and admitted, offhandedly, that his own understanding of economics has been seriously deficient as well. In a recent essay titled “What Economists (Including Me) Got Wrong About Globalization,” adapted from a forthcoming book on inequality, Krugman writes that he and other mainstream economists “missed a crucial part of the story” in failing to realize that globalization would lead to “hyperglobalization” and huge economic and social upheaval, particularly of the industrial middle class in America. And many of these working-class communities have been hit hard by Chinese competition, which economists made a “major mistake” in underestimating, Krugman says. ABOUT THE AUTHOR

Michael Hirsh is a senior correspondent and deputy news editor at Foreign Policy. Twitter: @michaelphirsh. It was quite a “whoops” moment, considering all the ruined American communities and displaced millions of workers we’ve seen in the interim. And a newly humbled Krugman must consider an even more disturbing idea: Did he and other mainstream economists help put a protectionist populist, Donald Trump, in the White House with a lot of bad advice about free markets? To be fair, Krugman has been forthright in recent years in second-guessing his earlier assertions about the effects of open trade. He has also become a leading and sometimes harsh critic of his own profession, especially in the aftermath of the financial crisis and Great Recession, when he declared that much of the past 30 years of macroeconomics was “spectacularly useless at best, and positively harmful at worst.” He admirably held the Obama administration to account for its timid financial and economic reforms. He even had some kind things to say about proto-progressives such as Robert Reich, the former Clinton administration labor secretary who worried about global competition and sought better protections and retraining for American workers, and whom Krugman had once dismissed to me—back in his lacerating days in the ’90s—as an “offensive figure, a brilliant coiner of one-liners but not a serious thinker.” “I’m glad he’s finally seen the light on trade,” Reich told me in an email. Krugman, in another email, wrote: “I regret having said that about Reich, but if he foresaw hyperglobalization or the localized effects of the China shock, that’s news to me.”

“I’m glad he’s finally seen the light on trade,” former Clinton administration labor secretary Robert Reich told me in an email.

Yet it has taken an awful long time for economists to admit that their profession has been far too sure of itself—or, as a penitent Krugman put it himself in a 2009 article in the New York Times Magazine, that “economists, as a group, mistook beauty, clad in impressive-looking mathematics, for truth.” As the journalist Binyamin Appelbaum writes in his new book, The Economists’ Hour: False Prophets, Free Markets, and the Fracture of Society, economists came to dominate policymaking in Washington in a way they never had before and, starting in the late 1960s, seriously misled the nation, helping to disrupt and divide it socially with a false sense of scientific certainty about the wonders of free markets. The economists pushed efficiency at all costs at the expense of social welfare and “subsumed the interests of Americans as producers to the interests of Americans as consumers, trading well-paid jobs for low-cost electronics.” David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) whose documentation of the surprising effects of China’s rapid rise on the U.S. labor market is cited by Krugman in his new essay, gives the Times columnist a lot of credit for admitting error. “How rare is that?!” Autor wrote via email. He said he doesn’t blame Krugman or other defenders of “the prior consensus” for making faulty predictions about trade. “I honestly think that getting this one right ex ante would have been akin to accurately forecasting the date, time and location of an earthquake.” The bigger problem was the pro-free trade zeitgeist, Autor said. “I think that the received wisdom inhibited economists from closely evaluating the evidence of what was underway. … One could say that there was something of a guild orthodoxy: The key dictum was that policymakers should be told that trade was good for everyone in all places and times.” Dani Rodrik, a Harvard University economist who in 1997 published a then-heretical book called Has Globalization Gone Too Far?, said last week that he wrote it precisely because he believed that “the profession was so blasé about globalization.” Now his views are mainstream, and Rodrik is president-elect of the International Economic Association. But the economists have barely begun to clean up the mess they left behind, as a conference on inequality at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, organized by Rodrik and former International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief economist Olivier Blanchard, made clear last week. And now in some ways it’s too late because, as Rodrik says, it’s not even possible to have a reasonable discussion under Trump. The U.S. president has effectively discarded modern economics, reembraced crude protectionism, and, like the mercantilists of the pre-Adam Smith era, appears to see trade as a zero-sum game in which surpluses are in effect profits and deficits are losses. His ignorance of basic economics “is without parallel among modern American presidents,” Appelbaum writes in The Economists’ Hour.

Krugman played a major part in attacking what he saw as economic ignorance by “strategic traders” who argued that U.S. jobs and wages might be seriously affected by cheap labor from the developing world.

Yet Trump has been able to launch an unprecedented trade war, exploiting the public’s mistrust and fear of China, thanks in part to the economists’ early misreadings—specifically of how swiftly China’s economic surge would displace so many U.S. industrial jobs. As Krugman now acknowledges, “manufacturing employment fell off a cliff after 2000, and this decline corresponded to a sharp increase” in the U.S. trade deficit, especially with China. Those numbers, in turn, have tended to lend credence to Trump’s mercantilist notions, no matter how spurious. “One of the most perverse effects of Trump was that it completely erased any reasonable discussion” about how to address trade, inequality, and the right degree of protection for workers, Rodrik said. And this, too, is a downstream effect of the bad advice economists delivered about free trade going back to the ’90s. Or as MIT’s Autor put it: “Ultimately this policy boosterism blinded policymakers to the potentially grave consequences of trade shocks and likely lulled us into underpreparing for these shocks (e.g., we had a paltry safety net and retraining policies on hand). It led us somewhat blithely into a non-negligible policy disaster (AKA the China Shock) and provoked a public backlash that has rendered free trade toxic in the U.S. policy debate. There’s an irony for you: trade boosterism has ultimately hurt the cause of free trade.” Asked whether the mistakes made by him and other economists helped lead to the rise of Trump, Krugman responded: “We’re still debating this, but as far as I can tell Trump’s trade policy isn’t resonating with many people, even his blue-collar base. So it’s kind of hard to blame trade analysts for the phenomenon.”

Others would disagree. Part of the problem is that, back in the ’90s, when the post-Cold War consensus was just emerging, economists tended to take a simplistic either-or view of trade—either you were a free trader or a protectionist—and forced people to choose sides. Krugman was one of them, adopting by and large the free trade position, which was ironic considering that his Nobel-winning work in economics was far more nuanced than his books and columns (and actually helped lay the intellectual foundations for smart strategic trade policy). Yet there were others in the policy debates—such as Rodrik, Reich, and Laura D’Andrea Tyson, who led former President Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers—who were far more worried about rapid globalization. They dared to question the pro-free trade consensus or at least, in Tyson’s case, to push for government-led industrial policy that would sharpen American competitiveness at a time when, after the Cold War, many newly liberalized nations were piling into the global economy at a great rate. This idea also was anathema to Krugman. “Dani was way ahead of his time,” Autor said. “He was worried not about sudden shocks per se but about the way that globalization hemmed in the policy options of open economies (options for financing social insurance, taxing increasingly mobile capital, etc). That was and is a deep point. … Meanwhile, Laura Tyson was advocating forward-looking industrial policy at a time when industrial policy was the Voldemort of policy tools.” Those who have studied Krugman’s work closely, like Autor, say that of course he understood that just the right kind of industrial policy could help build competitive sectors. But Autor added: “I suspect that economists feared that stating these points aloud to policymakers would be like handing a loaded weapon to a impetuous child.”

Those who advocated anything resembling government interference in markets and “fair trade” (more tariffs, unemployment insurance, and worker protections) over “free trade” were usually branded protectionists and excluded from the debate.

Krugman maintains that his new mea culpa “was a fairly narrow one” about how trade would affect lower-wage workers and exacerbate inequality. That is true. But after the Cold War ended, the debate over trade (Krugman’s Nobel-winning specialty) became a proxy for a larger intellectual struggle over free markets versus government intervention. And Krugman played a major part in attacking what he saw as economic ignorance by “strategic traders” who argued that U.S. jobs and wages might be seriously affected by competition from cheap labor in the developing world. When William Greider, the former Washington Post journalist, warned in a deeply reported book called One World, Ready or Not: The Manic Logic of Global Capitalism that developing nations were gearing up for major industrial competition that would mean “[s]ome sectors of Americans are triumphant and other sectors are devastated,” Krugman called it a “thoroughly silly book.” When Michael Lind, another prominent public intellectual, suggested (accurately) that U.S. productivity growth might not be enough to offset “the global sweatshop economy,” Krugman declared Lind to be ignorant of economic “facts” and said that “one should not expect someone who does not work in the field to be able to get it right without some guidance.” Krugman was no less kind to fellow economists who dared to question the free trade consensus. When Tyson was chosen to head Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers in 1993, Krugman said she lacked the “necessary analytical skills.” It was all just bad economics, Krugman said. Don’t worry so much about what all the other countries are up to; things will even out thanks to neoclassical concepts such as comparative advantage, which allows all nations to benefit from open trade. Indeed, those who advocated anything resembling government interference in markets and “fair trade” (more tariffs, unemployment insurance, and worker protections) over “free trade” were usually branded protectionists and excluded from the debate. Clinton, reveling in his reputation as the “globalization” president, barely held a meeting on the fate of the industrially displaced. When his old Rhodes Scholar pal from the University of Oxford, Labor Secretary Reich, openly advocated reinvestment in education, training, and infrastructure at a time when Clinton was keen on deficit-cutting, Reich was also edged out of the conversation and, eventually, the administration. Some ex-Clintonites such as Gene Sperling, the former head of the National Economic Council, argue that the debate was never so stark. “Clinton cared about the middle class,” he told me. And had the Democrats continued in power, they would have worked much harder to bring China into compliance with trade norms, for example by enforcing “anti-surge” protections—required of China as part of its World Trade Organization membership negotiated by Clinton in 1999—against the dumping of huge amounts of cheap product that undercut U.S. jobs, Sperling said. “People think that the only difference with Al Gore [in the 2000 presidential election] was the Iraq War, but another huge difference would have been that Gore would have gone way beyond anything [George W.] Bush did to protect manufacturing,” Sperling said. (A new book by the former Washington Post economics reporter Paul Blustein, Schism: China, America, and the Fracturing of the Global Trading System, also concludes that the Bush administration let China get away with far too much, including artificially devaluing its currency to boost exports—which led ultimately to Trump’s claim that China had committed “rape” of the U.S. economy.) Other former Krugman victims still blame him for his misjudgments and are not so assuaged by his penitence. “This is not bad as mea culpas go, but if you read through to the end, Krugman persists with the oversimplified dichotomy of free trade versus protectionism, ignoring such successful hybrids as East Asian neo-mercantilism,” said Robert Kuttner, the co-editor of the American Prospect and a much-cited progressive thinker. “This is all the more bizarre because the young Krugman came to prominence demonstrating that [national] competitive advantage could be created, something that any non-economist student of economic history could have told him.” Krugman, in his defense, has always believed in protections for the middle class, including better health care and education (his old Times blog was titled “The Conscience of a Liberal”), and he says now that just because he has admitted errors on trade doesn’t mean he ever endorsed the so-called Washington Consensus—the neoliberal (that is, pro-free trade) view that regularly came down on the side of fiscal discipline, rapid privatization, and deregulation. “I guess the point is that conceding that we got some things wrong doesn’t mean that every critic was right; it depends on what they said, and as far as I know almost nobody foresaw the massive rise in trade or focused at all on localized regional impacts,” Krugman told me last week. But there were deeper conceptual problems with the pro-globalization consensus as well. Another Nobel-winning economist, Joseph Stiglitz, who like Rodrik warned back in the ’90s of the disruptive effects of too rapid lowering of trade and capital barriers, told me that the problem with “standard neoclassical analysis” was that it “never paid any attention to adjustment. Labor market adjustment miraculously happened costlessly.” Like Tyson and Reich, Stiglitz, who served as a chair of Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers, was an outlier at the time, seeking (but failing) to slow the pace of international capital flows. He also argued that “typically jobs were destroyed far faster than new jobs were created.” Krugman, in his new essay, admits that the economists like him in favor of the ’90s consensus behind free trade—who thought that the effects on labor would be minimal—“didn’t turn much to analytic methods that focus on workers in particular industries and communities, which would have given a better picture of short-run trends. This was, I now believe, a major mistake—one in which I shared a hand.”

If he had taken office in February 2010, when employment hit rock bottom, he would be on track to see blockbuster 14 percent job growth in eight years (assuming 2017 job creation turns out to be equivalent to 2016).

Put simply, when you take office at the bottom of a recession and with unemployment high, you can “achieve” a lot of growth just from the natural healing of the economy. When you take office at the top, there is nowhere to go but down. This may presage bad news for Mr. Trump, given that the jobless rate was a relatively low 4.7 percent in December.

Demographic and economic destiny

Consider one of the big economic forces of the post-World War II economy: women entering the labor force on a mass scale. In 1948, only 33 percent of American women between 25 and 54 worked or sought work. By the time George W. Bush took office in January 2001, that had risen to about 77 percent.

That means that throughout the second half of the 20th century, the economy had a huge tailwind, as millions of women joined the work force and stated contributing to G.D.P. Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton didn’t create that trend; broader social forces did. But the fact that it happened made their economic records look better.

Expand the idea to other elements of demographics: the baby boom generation entering the labor force from the 1960s through the 1980s and now retiring; the large millennial generation coming into the work force. You see that a big part of the economic growth that might take place during a given presidency is determined by forces not under any politician’s control.",www.nytimes.com,left,Bd9NWCB5cTVKrgxy

For years, Democratic politicians have been shy about talking up the virtues of government. It was all the way back in 1996 that President Bill Clinton declared ""the era of big government is over.""

That may have changed with President Obama's second inaugural address. Obama declared that only through government and ""collective action"" can the nation achieve its full promise.

""The president was willing to make the case for government being one component that helps our economy,"" says former Virginia Democratic Rep. Tom Perriello. ""That's something you haven't heard much over the past generation or so.""

Democrats have certainly never lost the habit of arguing in favor of one government program or another. They've been less likely in recent years, however, to talk positively about the general role that government plays in American society.

""It's very difficult, if not impossible, for someone who is president or wants to be president to say government does the right thing most of the time, because Americans don't believe it,"" says Michael Kazin, a Georgetown University historian.

In his speech Monday, Obama seemed to be proposing a language for speaking positively about the role of government as a whole. Whether he and other Democrats continue to press this case will determine whether his address marked a turning point in how Americans talk and think about government, or if it was just another speech.

'Government Is The Problem'

In his first inaugural address in 1981, President Ronald Reagan said that ""government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.""

That sentiment has informed much Republican discourse ever since. The anti-tax, limited government point of view has been trumpeted not only by GOP politicians but well-funded and well-organized advocacy groups.

""There's this very articulate, widespread, bumper-sticker critique of government that is powerful and that people have heard enough times to hum along to — that markets are good and government's bad,"" Pierson says.

But offering suggestions about specific cuts to individual programs can be politically hazardous. Remember how hard Obama hammered last fall at his GOP opponent, Mitt Romney, for ""attacking Big Bird"" when he suggested slashing subsidies for public television.

Always Defending Big Bird

That's been a typical Democratic tactic, defending the value of concrete government programs from Republican attack, whether it's Social Security, weather forecasting or clean-water protections.

What Democrats have been reluctant to do for a generation is argue openly for government, per se — to insist that in a complex society and economy, government is not the enemy but a central component in promoting common goals both in the marketplace and in civil society.

That's why Obama's inaugural speech was seen as ""aggressive"" and ""unapologetically liberal.""

""One thing that is pretty clear from the president's speech yesterday — the era of liberalism is back,"" Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said Tuesday. ""An unabashedly, far left-of-center inauguration speech certainly brings back memories of the Democratic Party of ages past.""

Defending national security, training teachers, building roads and research labs — the president described all these as the work required not of individuals but of Americans acting together as a nation, through its government.

""There's a liberal tradition that Obama's pulling from, that government is a positive force to counteract the consequences of market economies,"" says Rosemary Feurer, a labor historian at Northern Illinois University. ""That's a powerful rhetoric, but it hasn't been deployed in my lifetime.""

Not Expanding Government ...

So, does Obama's speech signal that ""the era of big government being over is officially over,"" as McConnell says?

Probably not. For one thing, many would argue that big government never went away.

Defense spending has doubled over the past decade, while the years since Clinton's pronouncement have seen major new expansions in health coverage, including Obama's own Affordable Care Act and President George W. Bush's prescription drug program for the elderly.

In addition, both budget and political realities suggest that Obama will not be able to launch another major spending program such as his first-term stimulus package or the health care law.

In this regard, it's possible that his inaugural address was meant to open up not so much a new era of good feelings toward government but a means of praising what government does, to preserve as much of it as he can.

A negotiating ploy, in other words.

""This is a way for Obama and other Democrats to position themselves for compromises that they realize will have to come, on entitlements especially,"" says Kazin, the Georgetown historian. ""They've learned over the past two years, and after making gains in the election, that it's better to come on strong and then from that position begin to compromise.""

... But Making It Activist

On the other hand, a tighter federal purse doesn't mean Obama will be incapable of pursuing an activist approach to government. His newly announced appointments for the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau signal his desire to take a muscular approach.

Obama's most ambitious policy hopes for his second term — immigration, gun control, climate change — wouldn't involve significant new spending, but would each create more regulatory authority for the federal government.

The direction he'd like to go is clear. Obama's inaugural address was a ringing defense of using government as a tool for keeping society on the whole on the right path — perhaps the most full-throated argument of this kind that's been heard in a generation.

More concentration, less focus

Bulking up is a global trend. The annual number of mergers and acquisitions is more than twice what it was in the 1990s. But concentration is at its most worrying in America. The share of GDP generated by America’s 100 biggest companies rose from about 33% in 1994 to 46% in 2013. The five largest banks account for 45% of banking assets, up from 25% in 2000. In the home of the entrepreneur, the number of startups is lower than it has been at any time since the 1970s. More firms are dying than being born. Founders dream of selling their firms to one of the giants rather than of building their own titans.

For many laissez-faire types this is only a temporary problem. Modern technology is lowering barriers to entry; flaccid incumbents will be destroyed by smaller, leaner ones. But the idea that market concentration is self-correcting is more questionable than it once was. Slower growth encourages companies to buy their rivals and squeeze out costs. High-tech companies grow more useful to customers when they attract more users and when they gather ever more data about those users.

The heft of the superstars also reflects their excellence at less productive activities. About 30% of global foreign direct investment (FDI) flows through tax havens; big companies routinely use “transfer pricing” to pretend that profits generated in one part of the world are in fact made in another.

The backlash that followed helped to destroy the liberal order in much of Europe.

So, by all means celebrate the astonishing achievements of today’s superstar companies. But also watch them. The world needs a healthy dose of competition to keep today’s giants on their toes and to give those in their shadow a chance to grow.",www.economist.com,left,qsWZRK7Vs6w2feuo

Moody’s Investors Service said it may join Standard & Poor’s in downgrading the U.S.’s credit rating unless Congress next year reduces the percentage of debt- to-gross-domestic-product during budget negotiations.

The U.S. economy will probably tip into recession next year if lawmakers and President Barack Obama can’t break an impasse over the federal budget and if George W. Bush-era tax cuts expire in what’s become known as the “fiscal cliff,” according to a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office published on Aug. 22. The rating would likely be cut to Aa1 from Aaa if an agreement on the debt ratio isn’t reached, Moody’s said in a statement today.

Moody’s put the rating under review with a negative outlook in August 2011, when the U.S. pushed back a decision on spending and raised its so-called the debt ceiling after months of political wrangling. S&P cut its rating to AA+ that month, blaming the nation’s political process. Treasuries rallied as investors ignored the reduction, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note since declining to record lows and drawing the ire of investors such as Warren Buffett, the biggest shareholder of Moody’s, who said after the S&P decision that the U.S. should be “quadruple-A.”

Deficit Watch

McIntyre said his firm has reduced its Treasury holdings to lock in recent gains. U.S. government debt has returned 6.4 percent since the S&P downgrade and gained 9.8 percent in 2011, the most since 2008, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.

Debt-to-GDP

The Obama administration’s February budget that was updated in August would result in a debt-to-GDP ratio of 75 percent in 2022, New York-based Moody’s said. While the S&P rating cut was based in part of the firm’s view of the U.S. political process, Moody’s said it is waiting to see what policies are formulated.

“We will wait and see what they do in 2013, whether or not they come up with a specific proposal,” Steven Hess, senior vice president at Moody’s in New York, said today in a telephone interview. “If there is no result and they delay doing anything serious on deficit reduction, it’s likely that in 2013 we would move the rating down.”

Fiscal Cliff

The budget deficit will reach $1.1 trillion this year, according to the CBO. That would be down from last year’s $1.3 trillion, in part because tax revenue has risen by almost 6 percent and spending is down by about 1 percent this year.

“Everybody knows that if we don’t get our house in order, we’re in trouble,” said Thomas Roth, senior Treasury trader in New York at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA Inc. “If you get downgraded twice, you’re certainly not going to lend to that government at a lower rate.”

Coin Flip

For investors and policy makers, predicting the consequences of a rating change by S&P or Moody’s -- the dominant issuers of debt scores -- may be little different from flipping a coin.

Almost half the time, government bond yields fall when a rating action suggests they should climb, or they increase even as a change signals a decline, according to data compiled in June by Bloomberg on 314 upgrades, downgrades and outlook changes going back as far as 38 years. The rates moved in the opposite direction 47 percent of the time for Moody’s and for S&P. The data measured yields after a month relative to U.S. Treasury debt, the global benchmark.

Ratings companies are no longer trusted by the world’s biggest investors, according to the former head of structured finance at S&P.

“They’re there because people have to have them, not because people believe in them,” David Jacob, who was fired from S&P in December, said in July in an interview at Bloomberg headquarters in New York. “Maybe retail investors do, that’s the unfortunate part, but I think institutional investors don’t.”

Yields Increase

Buffett didn’t immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment sent to an assistant, Carrie Sova.

The 10-year yield rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.69 percent at 2:23 p.m. in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The price of the 1.625 percent note due in August 2022 fell 9/32, or $2.81 per $1,000 face amount, to 99 13/32. The yield fell to a record low of 1.379 percent on July 25.

Katz,"After the mid-1970s progress against poverty stalled . The 1973 oil crisis ushered in an era of growing inequality interrupted only briefly by the years of prosperity during the 1990s . Productivity increased , but , for the first time in American history , its gains were not shared by ordinary workers , whose real incomes declined even as the wealth of the rich soared . Poverty concentrated as never before in inner city districts scarred by chronic joblessness and racial segregation . America led western democracies in the proportion of its children living in poverty . It led the world in rates of incarceration . Trade union membership plummeted under an assault by big business abetted by the federal government . Policy responded by allowing the real value of the minimum wage , welfare benefits , and other social protections to erode . The dominant interpretation of America ’ s troubles blamed the War on Poverty and Great Society and constructed a rationale for responding to misery by retrenching on social spending . A bipartisan consensus emerged for solving the nation ’ s social and economic problems through a war on dependence , the devolution of authority , and the redesign of public policy along market models .
The years after the mid-1970s witnessed a confrontation between massive urban structural transformation and rightward moving social policy that registered in a reconfigured and intensified American poverty in the nation ’ s cities . It is no easy task to define an American city in the early twenty-first century . Fast-growing cities in the post-war Sun Belt differ dramatically from the old cities of the Northeast and Midwest as any drive through , for example , Los Angeles and Philadelphia makes clear . Nonetheless , all the nation ’ s central cities and their surrounding metropolitan areas experienced transformations of economy , demography , and space that resulted in urban forms without precedent in history . These transformations hold profound implications for poverty as both fact and idea , and they underscore the need to understand poverty as a problem of place as well as persons . A long tradition of social criticism—from nineteenth-century advocates of slum clearance through the “ Chicago school ” of the 1920s to the most cutting-edge urban theory of the twenty-first century—presents poverty as a problem of place . In one version , which has dominated discussions , conditions in places—most notably , substandard housing—produce , reinforce , or augment poverty . In an alternate version , poverty is a product of place itself , reproduced independent of the individuals who pass through it . Both versions help explain the link between poverty and the multisided transformation of metropolitan America .
The first transformation was economic : the death of the great industrial city that flourished from the late nineteenth century until the end of World War II . The decimation of manufacturing evident in Rust Belt cities resulted from both the growth of foreign industries , notably electronics and automobiles , and the corporate search for cheaper labor . Cities with economic sectors other than manufacturing ( such as banking , commerce , medicine , government , and education ) withstood deindustrialization most successfully . Those with no alternatives collapsed , while others struggled with mixed success . Some cities such as Las Vegas built economies on entertainment , hospitality , and retirement . With manufacturing withered , anchor institutions , “ eds and meds , ” increasingly sustained the economies of cities lucky enough to house them ; they became , in fact , the principal employers . In the late twentieth century , in the nation ’ s twenty largest cities , “ eds and meds ” provided almost 35 percent of jobs . As services replaced manufacturing everywhere , office towers emerged as the late twentieth century ’ s urban factories . Services include a huge array of activities and jobs , from the production of financial services to restaurants , from high paid professional work to unskilled jobs delivering pizza or cleaning offices . Reflecting this division , economic inequality within cities increased , accentuating both wealth and poverty .
The second kind of urban transformation was demographic . First was the migration of African Americans and white southerners to northern , midwestern , and western cities . Between World War I and 1970 , about seven million African Americans moved north . The results , of course , transformed the cities into which they moved . Between 1940 and 1970 , for example , San Francisco ’ s black population multiplied twenty-five times and Chicago ’ s grew five times . The movement of whites out of central cities to suburbs played counterpoint . Between 1950 and 1970 , the population of American cities increased by ten million people while the suburbs exploded with eighty-five million .
The idea that the white exodus to the suburbs represented “ flight ” from blacks oversimplifies a process with other roots as well . A shortage of housing ; urban congestion ; mass-produced suburban homes made affordable with low interest , long-term , federally insured loans ; and a new highway system all pulled Americans out of central cities to suburbs . At the same time , through “ blockbusting ” tactics , unscrupulous real estate brokers fanned racial fears , which accelerated out-migration . In the North and Midwest , the number of departing whites exceeded the incoming African Americans , resulting in population loss and the return of swaths of inner cities to empty , weed-filled lots that replaced working-class housing and factories—a process captured by the great photographer Camilo Jose Vergara with the label “ green ghetto. ” By contrast , population in Sun Belt cities such as Los Angeles moved in the opposite direction . Between 1957 and 1990 , the combination of economic opportunity , a warm climate , annexation , and in-migration boosted the Sun Belt ’ s urban population from 8.5 to 23 million .
A massive new immigration also changed the nation and its cities . As a result of the nationality based quotas enacted in the 1920s , the Great Depression , and World War II , immigration to the United States plummeted . The foreign-born population reached its nadir in 1970 . The lifting of the quotas in 1965 began to reverse immigration ’ s decline . Immigrants , however , now arrived from new sources , primarily Latin America and Asia . More immigrants entered the United States in the 1990s than during any other decade in its history . These new immigrants fueled population growth in both cities and suburbs . Unlike the immigrants of the early twentieth century , they often bypassed central cities to move directly to suburbs and spread out across the nation . In 1910 , for example , 84 percent of the foreign born in metropolitan Philadelphia lived in the central city . By 2006 the proportion had dropped to 35 percent . New immigrants have spread beyond the older gateway states to the Midwest and South , areas from which prior to 1990 immigrants largely were absent . Thanks to labor market networks in agriculture , construction , landscaping , and domestic service , Hispanics spread out of central cities and across the nation faster than any other ethnic group in American history . This new immigration has proved essential to labor market growth and urban revitalization . Again in metropolitan Philadelphia , between 2000 and 2006 , the foreign born accounted for 75 percent of labor force growth . A New York City research report “ concluded that immigrant entrepreneurs have become an increasingly powerful economic engine for New York City ... foreign-born entrepreneurs are starting a greater share of new businesses than native-born residents , stimulating growth in sectors from food manufacturing to health care , creating loads of new jobs and transforming once-sleepy neighborhoods into thriving commercial centers. ” Similar reports came in from around the nation from small as well as large cities and from suburbs .
Suburbanization became the first major force in the spatial transformation of urban America . Although suburbanization extends well back in American history , it exploded after World War II as population , retail , industry , services , and entertainment all suburbanized . In the 1950s , suburbs grew ten times as fast as central cities . Even though the Supreme Court had outlawed officially mandated racial segregation in 1917 and racial exclusions in real estate deeds in 1948 , suburbs found ways to use zoning and informal pressures to remain largely white until late in the twentieth century , when African Americans began to suburbanize . Even in suburbs , however , they clustered in segregated towns and neighborhoods . Suburbs , it should be stressed , never were as uniform as their image . In the post-war era , they came closer than ever before to the popular meaning of “ suburb ” as a bedroom community for families with children . But that meaning had shattered completely by the end of the twentieth century , as a variety of suburban types populated metropolitan landscapes , rendering distinctions between city and suburb increasingly obsolete . The collapse of the distinction emerged especially in older inner ring suburbs where the loss of industry , racial transformation , immigration , and white out-migration registered in shrinking tax bases , eroding infrastructure , and increased poverty .
Gentrification and a new domestic landscape furthered the spatial transformation of urban America . Gentrification may be redefined as the rehabilitation of working-class housing for use by a wealthier class . Outside of select neighborhoods , gentrification by itself could not reverse the economic and population decline of cities , but it did transform center city neighborhoods with renovated architecture and new amenities demanded by young white professionals and empty-nesters who had moved in . At the same time , it often displaced existing residents , adding to a crisis of affordable housing that helped fuel homelessness and other hardships .
The new domestic landscape resulted from the revolutionary rebalancing of family types that accelerated after 1970 . In 1900 married couples with children made up 55 percent of all households , single-mother families 28 percent , empty-nesters 6 percent , and nonfamily households ( mainly young people living together ) 10 percent , with a small residue living in other arrangements . By 2000 the shift was astonishing . Married couple households now made up only 25 percent of all households , single-mother families 30 percent , empty-nesters 16 percent , and nonfamily households 25 percent . ( The small increase in single-mother families masked a huge change . Earlier in the century they were mostly widows ; by century ’ s end they were primarily never married , divorced , or separated . ) What is stunning is how after 1970 these trends characterized suburbs as well as central cities , eroding distinctions between them . Between 1970 and 2000 , for example , the proportion of census tracts where married couples with children comprised more than half of all households plummeted from 59 percent to 12 percent and in central cities from 12 percent to 3 percent . In the same years , the proportion of suburban census tracts where single mothers composed at least 25 percent of households jumped an astonishing 440 percent—from 5 percent to 27 percent—while in central cities it grew from 32 percent to 59 percent . The share of census tracts with at least 30 percent nonfamily households leaped from 8 to 35 percent in suburbs and from 28 to 57 percent in cities . These changes took place across America , in Sun Belt as well as Rust Belt . Truly , a new domestic landscape eroding distinctions between city and suburb had emerged within metropolitan America . Its consequences were immense . The rise in single-mother families living in poverty shaped new districts of concentrated poverty and fueled the rise in suburban poverty . Immigration brought young , working-class families to many cities and sparked revitalization in neighborhoods largely untouched by the growth and change brought about by gentrification .
Racial segregation also transformed urban space . The first important point about urban racial segregation is that it was much lower early rather than late in the twentieth century . In 1930 the neighborhood in which the average African American lived was 31.7 percent black ; in 1970 it was 73.5 percent . No ethnic group in American history ever experienced comparable segregation . Sociologists Douglas Massey and Nancy Denton , with good reason , described the situation as “ American apartheid. ” In sixteen metropolitan areas in 1980 , one of three African Americans lived in areas so segregated along multiple dimensions that Massey and Denton labeled them “ hypersegration. ” Even affluent African Americans were more likely to live near poor African Americans than affluent whites . Racial segregation , argued Massey and Denton , by itself produced poverty . Areas of concentrated poverty , in turn , existed largely outside of markets—any semblance of functioning housing markets had dissolved , financial and retail services had decamped , jobs in the regular market had disappeared . Concentrated poverty and chronic joblessness went hand in hand . Public infrastructure and institutions decayed , leaving them epicenters of homelessness , crime , and despair . Even though segregation declined slightly in the 1990s , at the end of the century , the average African American lived in a neighborhood 51 percent black , many thousands in districts marked by a toxic combination of poverty and racial concentration . This progress reversed in the first decade of the twentieth century . “ After declining in the 1990s , ” reported a Brookings Institution study , “ the population in extreme-poverty neighborhoods—where at least 40 percent of individuals lived below the poverty line—rose by one-third from 2000 to 2005–09 . ”
Despite continued African American segregation , a “ new regime of residential segregation ” began to appear in American cities , according to Massey and his colleagues . The new immigration did not increase ethnic segregation ; measures of immigrant segregation remained “ low to moderate ” while black segregation declined modestly . However , as racial segregation declined , economic segregation increased , separating the poor from the affluent and the college educated from high school graduates . Spatial isolation marked people “ at the top and bottom of the socioeconomic scale. ” The growth of economic inequality joined increased economic segregation to further transform urban space . America , wrote three noted urban scholars , “ is breaking down into economically homogeneous enclaves. ” This rise in economic segregation afflicted suburbs as well as inner cities , notably sharpening distinctions between old inner ring suburbs and more well-to-do suburbs and exurbs . Early in the twenty-first century , as many poor people lived in suburbs as in cities , and poverty within suburbs was growing faster within them .
In the post-war decades , urban redevelopment also fueled urban spatial transformation . Urban renewal focused on downtown land use , clearing out working-class housing , small businesses , and other unprofitable uses , and replacing them with high-rise office buildings , anchor institutions , and expensive residences . The 1949 Housing Act kicked off the process by facilitating city governments ’ aspirations to assemble large tracts of land through eminent domain and sell them cheaply to developers . The Act authorized 810,000 units of housing to re-house displaced residents ; by 1960 , only 320,000 had been constructed . These new units of public housing remained by and large confined to racially segregated districts and never were sufficient in number to meet existing needs . “ Between 1956 and 1972 , ” report Peter Dreier and his colleagues , experts in urban policy , “ urban renewal and urban freeway construction displaced an estimated 3.8 million persons from their homes ” but rehoused only a small fraction . The costs of urban renewal to the social fabric of cities and the well-being of their residents were huge . Urban renewal “ certainly changed the skyline of some big cities by subsidizing the construction of large office buildings that housed corporate headquarters , law firms , and other corporate activities ” but at the price of destroying far more “ low-cost housing than it built ” and failing “ to stem the movement of people and businesses to suburbs or to improve the economic and living conditions of inner-city neighborhoods . On the contrary , it destabilized many of them , promoting chaotic racial transition and flight . ”
Neither the War on Poverty nor Great Society slowed or reversed the impact of urban redevelopment and racial segregation on the nation ’ s cities . President John F. Kennedy finally honored a campaign pledge in 1962 with a federal regulation prohibiting discrimination in federally supported housing—an action that “ turned out to be more symbolic than real ” on account of weak enforcement . In the 1968 Fair Housing Act , President Lyndon Johnson extended the ban on discrimination , and the practices that produced it , to the private housing market . Unfortunately , weak enforcement mechanisms left it , too , inadequate to the task throughout the 1970s and 1980s .
For the most part , the War on Poverty and Great Society rested on an understanding of poverty as a problem of persons , or , in the case of community action , of power , but less often of place . Opportunity-based programs addressed the deficiencies of individuals , not the pathologies of the places in which they lived . This hobbled their capacity from the outset . The conservatives who seized on the persistence of poverty to underscore and exaggerate the limits of the poverty war and Great Society retained this individual-centered understanding of poverty as they developed a critique of past efforts and a program for the future , neither of which was adequate to the task at hand .
The coincidence of America ’ s urban slide into deep urban racial segregation , concentrated poverty , deindustrialization , physical decay , and near-bankruptcy coincided with the manifest failures of public policy , notably in urban renewal , and in the efforts of government to wage war on poverty . No matter that the story as popularly told was riddled with distortions and omissions . This narrative of catastrophic decline and public incompetence produced the trope of the “ urban crisis , ” which , in turn , handed conservatives a gift : a ready-made tale—a living example—to use as evidence for the bundle of ideas they had been nurturing for decades and which emerged triumphant by the late 1970s .
The growth of urban poverty did not rekindle compassion or renew the faltering energy of the Great Society . Instead , a war on welfare accompanied the conservative revival of the 1980s . City governments , teetering on the edge of bankruptcy , cut social services ; state governments trimmed welfare rolls with more restrictive rules for General Assistance ( state outdoor relief ) ; and the federal government attacked social programs . As President Ronald Reagan famously remarked , government was the problem , not the solution . The result of these activities reduced the availability of help from each level of government during the years when profound structural transformations in American society increased poverty and its attendant hardships .
Several sources fed the conservative restoration symbolized by Ronald Reagan ’ s election as president in 1980. Business interests , unable to compete in an increasingly international market , wanted to lower wages by reducing the influence of unions and cutting social programs that not only raised taxes but offered an alternative to poorly paid jobs . The energy crisis of 1973 ushered in an era of stagflation in which public psychology shifted away from its relatively relaxed attitude toward the expansion of social welfare . Increasingly worried about downward mobility and their children ’ s future , many Americans returned to an older psychology of scarcity . As they examined the sources of their distress , looking for both villains and ways to cut public spending , ordinary Americans and their elected representatives focused on welfare and its beneficiaries , deflecting attention from the declining profits and returns on investments that , since the mid-1970s , should have alerted them to the end of unlimited growth and abundance .
Desegregation and affirmative action fueled resentments . Many whites protested court-ordered busing as a remedy for racial segregation in education , and they objected to civil rights laws , housing subsidies , and public assistance support for blacks who wanted to move into their neighborhoods while they struggled to pay their own mortgages and grocery bills . White workers often believed they lost jobs and promotions to less qualified blacks . Government programs associated with Democrats and liberal politics became the villains in these interpretations , driving blue-collar workers decisively to the right and displacing anger away from the source of their deteriorating economic conditions onto government , minorities , and the `` undeserving poor . ''

The 1973 oil crisis ushered in an era of growing inequality interrupted only briefly by the years of prosperity during the 1990s. Productivity increased, but, for the first time in American history, its gains were not shared by ordinary workers, whose real incomes declined even as the wealth of the rich soared. Poverty concentrated as never before in inner city districts scarred by chronic joblessness and racial segregation. America led western democracies in the proportion of its children living in poverty. It led the world in rates of incarceration. Trade union membership plummeted under an assault by big business abetted by the federal government. Policy responded by allowing the real value of the minimum wage, welfare benefits, and other social protections to erode. The dominant interpretation of America’s troubles blamed the War on Poverty and Great Society and constructed a rationale for responding to misery by retrenching on social spending. A bipartisan consensus emerged for solving the nation’s social and economic problems through a war on dependence, the devolution of authority, and the redesign of public policy along market models.

Urban Transformation

The years after the mid-1970s witnessed a confrontation between massive urban structural transformation and rightward moving social policy that registered in a reconfigured and intensified American poverty in the nation’s cities. It is no easy task to define an American city in the early twenty-first century. Fast-growing cities in the post-war Sun Belt differ dramatically from the old cities of the Northeast and Midwest as any drive through, for example, Los Angeles and Philadelphia makes clear. Nonetheless, all the nation’s central cities and their surrounding metropolitan areas experienced transformations of economy, demography, and space that resulted in urban forms without precedent in history. These transformations hold profound implications for poverty as both fact and idea, and they underscore the need to understand poverty as a problem of place as well as persons. A long tradition of social criticism—from nineteenth-century advocates of slum clearance through the “Chicago school” of the 1920s to the most cutting-edge urban theory of the twenty-first century—presents poverty as a problem of place. In one version, which has dominated discussions, conditions in places—most notably, substandard housing—produce, reinforce, or augment poverty. In an alternate version, poverty is a product of place itself, reproduced independent of the individuals who pass through it. Both versions help explain the link between poverty and the multisided transformation of metropolitan America.

The first transformation was economic: the death of the great industrial city that flourished from the late nineteenth century until the end of World War II. The decimation of manufacturing evident in Rust Belt cities resulted from both the growth of foreign industries, notably electronics and automobiles, and the corporate search for cheaper labor. Cities with economic sectors other than manufacturing (such as banking, commerce, medicine, government, and education) withstood deindustrialization most successfully. Those with no alternatives collapsed, while others struggled with mixed success. Some cities such as Las Vegas built economies on entertainment, hospitality, and retirement. With manufacturing withered, anchor institutions, “eds and meds,” increasingly sustained the economies of cities lucky enough to house them; they became, in fact, the principal employers. In the late twentieth century, in the nation’s twenty largest cities, “eds and meds” provided almost 35 percent of jobs. As services replaced manufacturing everywhere, office towers emerged as the late twentieth century’s urban factories. Services include a huge array of activities and jobs, from the production of financial services to restaurants, from high paid professional work to unskilled jobs delivering pizza or cleaning offices. Reflecting this division, economic inequality within cities increased, accentuating both wealth and poverty.

The second kind of urban transformation was demographic. First was the migration of African Americans and white southerners to northern, midwestern, and western cities. Between World War I and 1970, about seven million African Americans moved north. The results, of course, transformed the cities into which they moved. Between 1940 and 1970, for example, San Francisco’s black population multiplied twenty-five times and Chicago’s grew five times. The movement of whites out of central cities to suburbs played counterpoint. Between 1950 and 1970, the population of American cities increased by ten million people while the suburbs exploded with eighty-five million.

The idea that the white exodus to the suburbs represented “flight” from blacks oversimplifies a process with other roots as well. A shortage of housing; urban congestion; mass-produced suburban homes made affordable with low interest, long-term, federally insured loans; and a new highway system all pulled Americans out of central cities to suburbs. At the same time, through “blockbusting” tactics, unscrupulous real estate brokers fanned racial fears, which accelerated out-migration. In the North and Midwest, the number of departing whites exceeded the incoming African Americans, resulting in population loss and the return of swaths of inner cities to empty, weed-filled lots that replaced working-class housing and factories—a process captured by the great photographer Camilo Jose Vergara with the label “green ghetto.” By contrast, population in Sun Belt cities such as Los Angeles moved in the opposite direction. Between 1957 and 1990, the combination of economic opportunity, a warm climate, annexation, and in-migration boosted the Sun Belt’s urban population from 8.5 to 23 million.

A massive new immigration also changed the nation and its cities. As a result of the nationality based quotas enacted in the 1920s, the Great Depression, and World War II, immigration to the United States plummeted. The foreign-born population reached its nadir in 1970. The lifting of the quotas in 1965 began to reverse immigration’s decline. Immigrants, however, now arrived from new sources, primarily Latin America and Asia. More immigrants entered the United States in the 1990s than during any other decade in its history. These new immigrants fueled population growth in both cities and suburbs. Unlike the immigrants of the early twentieth century, they often bypassed central cities to move directly to suburbs and spread out across the nation. In 1910, for example, 84 percent of the foreign born in metropolitan Philadelphia lived in the central city. By 2006 the proportion had dropped to 35 percent. New immigrants have spread beyond the older gateway states to the Midwest and South, areas from which prior to 1990 immigrants largely were absent. Thanks to labor market networks in agriculture, construction, landscaping, and domestic service, Hispanics spread out of central cities and across the nation faster than any other ethnic group in American history. This new immigration has proved essential to labor market growth and urban revitalization. Again in metropolitan Philadelphia, between 2000 and 2006, the foreign born accounted for 75 percent of labor force growth. A New York City research report “concluded that immigrant entrepreneurs have become an increasingly powerful economic engine for New York City...foreign-born entrepreneurs are starting a greater share of new businesses than native-born residents, stimulating growth in sectors from food manufacturing to health care, creating loads of new jobs and transforming once-sleepy neighborhoods into thriving commercial centers.” Similar reports came in from around the nation from small as well as large cities and from suburbs.

Suburbanization became the first major force in the spatial transformation of urban America. Although suburbanization extends well back in American history, it exploded after World War II as population, retail, industry, services, and entertainment all suburbanized. In the 1950s, suburbs grew ten times as fast as central cities. Even though the Supreme Court had outlawed officially mandated racial segregation in 1917 and racial exclusions in real estate deeds in 1948, suburbs found ways to use zoning and informal pressures to remain largely white until late in the twentieth century, when African Americans began to suburbanize. Even in suburbs, however, they clustered in segregated towns and neighborhoods. Suburbs, it should be stressed, never were as uniform as their image. In the post-war era, they came closer than ever before to the popular meaning of “suburb” as a bedroom community for families with children. But that meaning had shattered completely by the end of the twentieth century, as a variety of suburban types populated metropolitan landscapes, rendering distinctions between city and suburb increasingly obsolete. The collapse of the distinction emerged especially in older inner ring suburbs where the loss of industry, racial transformation, immigration, and white out-migration registered in shrinking tax bases, eroding infrastructure, and increased poverty.

Gentrification and a new domestic landscape furthered the spatial transformation of urban America. Gentrification may be redefined as the rehabilitation of working-class housing for use by a wealthier class. Outside of select neighborhoods, gentrification by itself could not reverse the economic and population decline of cities, but it did transform center city neighborhoods with renovated architecture and new amenities demanded by young white professionals and empty-nesters who had moved in. At the same time, it often displaced existing residents, adding to a crisis of affordable housing that helped fuel homelessness and other hardships.

The new domestic landscape resulted from the revolutionary rebalancing of family types that accelerated after 1970. In 1900 married couples with children made up 55 percent of all households, single-mother families 28 percent, empty-nesters 6 percent, and nonfamily households (mainly young people living together) 10 percent, with a small residue living in other arrangements. By 2000 the shift was astonishing. Married couple households now made up only 25 percent of all households, single-mother families 30 percent, empty-nesters 16 percent, and nonfamily households 25 percent. (The small increase in single-mother families masked a huge change. Earlier in the century they were mostly widows; by century’s end they were primarily never married, divorced, or separated.) What is stunning is how after 1970 these trends characterized suburbs as well as central cities, eroding distinctions between them. Between 1970 and 2000, for example, the proportion of census tracts where married couples with children comprised more than half of all households plummeted from 59 percent to 12 percent and in central cities from 12 percent to 3 percent. In the same years, the proportion of suburban census tracts where single mothers composed at least 25 percent of households jumped an astonishing 440 percent—from 5 percent to 27 percent—while in central cities it grew from 32 percent to 59 percent. The share of census tracts with at least 30 percent nonfamily households leaped from 8 to 35 percent in suburbs and from 28 to 57 percent in cities. These changes took place across America, in Sun Belt as well as Rust Belt. Truly, a new domestic landscape eroding distinctions between city and suburb had emerged within metropolitan America. Its consequences were immense. The rise in single-mother families living in poverty shaped new districts of concentrated poverty and fueled the rise in suburban poverty. Immigration brought young, working-class families to many cities and sparked revitalization in neighborhoods largely untouched by the growth and change brought about by gentrification.

Racial segregation also transformed urban space. The first important point about urban racial segregation is that it was much lower early rather than late in the twentieth century. In 1930 the neighborhood in which the average African American lived was 31.7 percent black; in 1970 it was 73.5 percent. No ethnic group in American history ever experienced comparable segregation. Sociologists Douglas Massey and Nancy Denton, with good reason, described the situation as “American apartheid.” In sixteen metropolitan areas in 1980, one of three African Americans lived in areas so segregated along multiple dimensions that Massey and Denton labeled them “hypersegration.” Even affluent African Americans were more likely to live near poor African Americans than affluent whites. Racial segregation, argued Massey and Denton, by itself produced poverty. Areas of concentrated poverty, in turn, existed largely outside of markets—any semblance of functioning housing markets had dissolved, financial and retail services had decamped, jobs in the regular market had disappeared. Concentrated poverty and chronic joblessness went hand in hand. Public infrastructure and institutions decayed, leaving them epicenters of homelessness, crime, and despair. Even though segregation declined slightly in the 1990s, at the end of the century, the average African American lived in a neighborhood 51 percent black, many thousands in districts marked by a toxic combination of poverty and racial concentration. This progress reversed in the first decade of the twentieth century. “After declining in the 1990s,” reported a Brookings Institution study, “the population in extreme-poverty neighborhoods—where at least 40 percent of individuals lived below the poverty line—rose by one-third from 2000 to 2005–09.”

Despite continued African American segregation, a “new regime of residential segregation” began to appear in American cities, according to Massey and his colleagues. The new immigration did not increase ethnic segregation; measures of immigrant segregation remained “low to moderate” while black segregation declined modestly. However, as racial segregation declined, economic segregation increased, separating the poor from the affluent and the college educated from high school graduates. Spatial isolation marked people “at the top and bottom of the socioeconomic scale.” The growth of economic inequality joined increased economic segregation to further transform urban space. America, wrote three noted urban scholars, “is breaking down into economically homogeneous enclaves.” This rise in economic segregation afflicted suburbs as well as inner cities, notably sharpening distinctions between old inner ring suburbs and more well-to-do suburbs and exurbs. Early in the twenty-first century, as many poor people lived in suburbs as in cities, and poverty within suburbs was growing faster within them.

In the post-war decades, urban redevelopment also fueled urban spatial transformation. Urban renewal focused on downtown land use, clearing out working-class housing, small businesses, and other unprofitable uses, and replacing them with high-rise office buildings, anchor institutions, and expensive residences. The 1949 Housing Act kicked off the process by facilitating city governments’ aspirations to assemble large tracts of land through eminent domain and sell them cheaply to developers. The Act authorized 810,000 units of housing to re-house displaced residents; by 1960, only 320,000 had been constructed. These new units of public housing remained by and large confined to racially segregated districts and never were sufficient in number to meet existing needs. “Between 1956 and 1972,” report Peter Dreier and his colleagues, experts in urban policy, “urban renewal and urban freeway construction displaced an estimated 3.8 million persons from their homes” but rehoused only a small fraction. The costs of urban renewal to the social fabric of cities and the well-being of their residents were huge. Urban renewal “certainly changed the skyline of some big cities by subsidizing the construction of large office buildings that housed corporate headquarters, law firms, and other corporate activities” but at the price of destroying far more “low-cost housing than it built” and failing “to stem the movement of people and businesses to suburbs or to improve the economic and living conditions of inner-city neighborhoods. On the contrary, it destabilized many of them, promoting chaotic racial transition and flight.”

Neither the War on Poverty nor Great Society slowed or reversed the impact of urban redevelopment and racial segregation on the nation’s cities. President John F. Kennedy finally honored a campaign pledge in 1962 with a federal regulation prohibiting discrimination in federally supported housing—an action that “turned out to be more symbolic than real” on account of weak enforcement. In the 1968 Fair Housing Act, President Lyndon Johnson extended the ban on discrimination, and the practices that produced it, to the private housing market. Unfortunately, weak enforcement mechanisms left it, too, inadequate to the task throughout the 1970s and 1980s.

For the most part, the War on Poverty and Great Society rested on an understanding of poverty as a problem of persons, or, in the case of community action, of power, but less often of place. Opportunity-based programs addressed the deficiencies of individuals, not the pathologies of the places in which they lived. This hobbled their capacity from the outset. The conservatives who seized on the persistence of poverty to underscore and exaggerate the limits of the poverty war and Great Society retained this individual-centered understanding of poverty as they developed a critique of past efforts and a program for the future, neither of which was adequate to the task at hand.

The coincidence of America’s urban slide into deep urban racial segregation, concentrated poverty, deindustrialization, physical decay, and near-bankruptcy coincided with the manifest failures of public policy, notably in urban renewal, and in the efforts of government to wage war on poverty. No matter that the story as popularly told was riddled with distortions and omissions. This narrative of catastrophic decline and public incompetence produced the trope of the “urban crisis,” which, in turn, handed conservatives a gift: a ready-made tale—a living example—to use as evidence for the bundle of ideas they had been nurturing for decades and which emerged triumphant by the late 1970s.

The Conservative Ascendance

The growth of urban poverty did not rekindle compassion or renew the faltering energy of the Great Society. Instead, a war on welfare accompanied the conservative revival of the 1980s. City governments, teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, cut social services; state governments trimmed welfare rolls with more restrictive rules for General Assistance (state outdoor relief); and the federal government attacked social programs. As President Ronald Reagan famously remarked, government was the problem, not the solution. The result of these activities reduced the availability of help from each level of government during the years when profound structural transformations in American society increased poverty and its attendant hardships.

Several sources fed the conservative restoration symbolized by Ronald Reagan’s election as president in 1980. Business interests, unable to compete in an increasingly international market, wanted to lower wages by reducing the influence of unions and cutting social programs that not only raised taxes but offered an alternative to poorly paid jobs. The energy crisis of 1973 ushered in an era of stagflation in which public psychology shifted away from its relatively relaxed attitude toward the expansion of social welfare. Increasingly worried about downward mobility and their children’s future, many Americans returned to an older psychology of scarcity. As they examined the sources of their distress, looking for both villains and ways to cut public spending, ordinary Americans and their elected representatives focused on welfare and its beneficiaries, deflecting attention from the declining profits and returns on investments that, since the mid-1970s, should have alerted them to the end of unlimited growth and abundance.

Desegregation and affirmative action fueled resentments. Many whites protested court-ordered busing as a remedy for racial segregation in education, and they objected to civil rights laws, housing subsidies, and public assistance support for blacks who wanted to move into their neighborhoods while they struggled to pay their own mortgages and grocery bills. White workers often believed they lost jobs and promotions to less qualified blacks. Government programs associated with Democrats and liberal politics became the villains in these interpretations, driving blue-collar workers decisively to the right and displacing anger away from the source of their deteriorating economic conditions onto government, minorities, and the ""undeserving poor.""

Suburbanization, the increased influence of the South on electoral politics and the politicization of conservative Protestantism, also fueled the conservative ascendance. “Suburbia,” political commentator Kevin Phillips asserted, “did not take kindly to rent subsidies, school balance schemes, growing Negro migration or rising welfare costs. . . . The great majority of middle-class suburbanites opposed racial or welfare innovation.” Together, the Sun Belt and suburbs, after 1970 the home to a majority of voters, constituted the demographic base of the new conservatism, assuring the rightward movement of politics among Democrats as well as Republicans and reinforcing hostility toward public social programs that served the poor—especially those who were black or Hispanic. The “middle class” became the lodestone of American politics, the poor its third rail.

Prior to the 1970s, conservative Christians (a term encompassing evangelicals and fundamentalists) largely distrusted electoral politics and avoided political involvement. This stance reversed in the 1970s when conservative Christians entered politics to protect their families and stem the moral corruption of the nation. Among the objects of their attack was welfare, which they believed weakened families by encouraging out-of-wedlock births, sex outside of marriage, and the ability of men to escape the responsibilities of fatherhood. Conservative Christians composed a powerful political force, about a third of the white electorate in the South and a little more than a tenth in the North. By the 1990s they constituted the largest and most powerful grassroots movement in American politics. In the 1994 elections, for the first time a majority of evangelicals identified themselves as Republicans. Although the inspiration for the Christian Right grew out of social and moral issues, it forged links with free-market conservatives. Fiscal conservatism appealed to conservative Christians whose “economic fortunes depend more on keeping tax rates low by reducing government spending than on social welfare programs that poor fundamentalists might desire,” asserted sociologists Robert Wuthnow and Matthew P. Lawson. The conservative politics that resulted fused opposition to government social programs and permissive legislation and court decisions (abortion, school prayer, gay civil rights, the Equal Rights Amendment, teaching evolution) with “support of economic policies favorable to the middle-class”—a powerful combination crucial for constructing the electoral and financial base of conservative politics.

Two financial sources bankrolled the rightward movement of American politics. Political action committees mobilized cash contributions from grassroots supporters while conservative foundations, corporations, and wealthy individuals supported individual candidates, organized opposition to public programs, and developed a network of think tanks—including the American Enterprise Institute, the Heritage Foundation, and the libertarian Cato Institute—designed to counter liberalism, disseminate conservative ideas, and promote conservative public policy. Within a year of its founding in 1973, the Heritage Foundation had received grants from eighty-seven corporations and six or seven other major foundations. In 1992 to 1994 alone, twelve conservative foundations holding assets worth $1.1 billion awarded grants totaling $300 million. In 1995 the top five conservative foundations enjoyed revenues of $77 million compared to only $18.6 million for “their eight political equivalents on the left.”

As well as producing ideas, conservative think tanks marketed them aggressively. Historian James Smith writes that, “marketing and promotion” did “more to change the think tanks’ definition of their role (and the public’s perception of them)” than did anything else. Their conservative funders paid “meticulous attention to the entire ‘knowledge production process,’ ” represented as a “conveyor belt” extending from “academic research to marketing and mobilization, from scholars to activists.” Their “sophisticated and effective outreach strategies” included policy papers, media appearances, advertising campaigns, op ed articles, and direct mail. In 1989 the Heritage Foundation spent 36 percent of its budget on marketing and 15 percent on fundraising. At the same time, wealthy donors countered the liberal politics of most leading social scientists with “lavish amounts of support on scholars willing to orient their research” toward conservative outcomes and a “grow-your-own approach” that funded “law students, student editors, and campus leaders with scholarships, leadership training, and law and economics classes aimed at ensuring the next generation of academic leaders has an even more conservative cast than the current one.”

With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the bond holding together the social and economic strands of conservatism weakened, replaced at last by a new enemy, militant Islam embodied in Iraq and Iran and in the Taliban and Al Qaeda.

President Barack Obama ’ s proposal to increase taxes on only “ high-income earners ” would also be economically destructive , reducing economic output by an average of $ 196 billion per year over 2013–2022 relative to current tax policy . Congress and the President would better serve the country by reforming the tax code in a pro-growth , revenue-neutral way and by reducing federal spending .
Nearly historic increases in federal personal income and payroll taxes combined with modest reductions in federal spending are set to begin on January 1 , 2013 . This is the “ fiscal cliff ” : a combination of fiscal policy changes that many analysts believe will send the U.S. economy into a recession .
Understandably , President Barack Obama and congressional leaders in both political parties are seeking a way to avoid this policy-driven cliff . In addressing the fiscal cliff , President Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress have taken the peculiar tack of pushing to increase taxes primarily on “ high-income earners ” and small businesses , [ 1 ] even though these same leaders argue that raising taxes on all earners would damage the economy . Somehow , raising taxes only on high-income earners is supposedly not economically destructive .
This line of reasoning is simply mistaken . The economy will slow significantly whether the federal government raises tax rates on everyone or only on high-income earners . [ 2 ] The analysis of the Obama tax plan presented in this paper indicates that the U.S. econoFmy would slow significantly if tax rates on ordinary income , dividend income , and capital gains income rise for high-income earners .
This study uses the Center for Data Analysis ’ s microsimulation model of the federal individual income tax , which is based on Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) data and the IHS Global Insight ( GII ) short-term U.S. macroeconomic model , to evaluate the economic and budgetary effects of the tax scenarios . [ 3 ] We compare the forecast scenario to a baseline forecast scenario representing the indefinite continuation of the current tax policy .
Relative to the economy ’ s performance under the current policy , we find that total output and income would decline by approximately $ 105 billion in 2012 and by an average of $ 196 billion per year over 2013–2022 . The decline in economic output is consistent with prevalent recessionary concerns . The slowdown in real output occurs because :
Higher tax rates on investment raise the cost of capital investment , and higher tax rates on labor income reduce the incentive to work and supply labor in the U.S. economy . Over the long run , the decline in private-sector investment would reduce the capital stock , leading to slower output and labor supply in the U.S. economy .
Gross private-sector investment would decline by an average of $ 126 billion ( 4.1 percent ) per year , reducing real capital stock in the U.S. economy by an average of $ 229 billion ( 1.2 percent ) per year . The reduction in private-sector investment and capital services over the long run would reduce the labor supply at different economic margins : Private-sector employment in the U.S. economy would fall by an average 1.1 million jobs ( 1 percent ) per year , and Americans would work 2 billion fewer hours relative to baseline levels .
The President believes his tax proposal will increase federal revenue by an average of $ 160 billion per year . The results of the dynamic simulation indicate that the President ’ s proposal would achieve only about $ 68 billion per year—less than one-half of the President ’ s projection . The dynamic result is due to a smaller tax base commensurate with the smaller economy . For example , fewer hours worked and lower real wages result in less federal income and payroll tax receipts .
As we have argued previously , it is crucial that congressional leaders avoid all potential tax increases in the fiscal cliff . [ 4 ] The nation faces a severe long-term fiscal imbalance , with elevated spending today transitioning to even higher entitlement-driven spending tomorrow .
We can not solve the long-run fiscal imbalance with tax increases , especially when tax rate increases would leave the U.S. economy weaker and federal revenues lower than assumed under static forecasts . The best path forward is to achieve fiscal balance by implementing pro-growth , revenue-neutral , fundamental reform of the U.S. tax code and by setting federal discretionary and mandatory spending on a significantly slower trajectory as detailed in ███ ’ s Saving the American Dream plan . [ 5 ]
The tax treatment of “ the rich ” —the high-income earners facing the top marginal tax rate—has received a great deal of attention . However , the discussion generally ignores the fact that many of “ the rich ” are small-business tax filers who report their income through the individual income tax system rather than the corporate tax code .
A significant portion of the tax increases on small businesses will be due to the increase in the top marginal rate and the other tax cuts aimed at high-income earners . ( See Table 1 . ) Small businesses tend to be owned by high-income individuals , even if the business losses and expenses mean that total annual business income is not high . This ownership means that these small businesses bear the highest marginal tax rate on decisions that their owners make on expansion and business growth .
The best outcome for tax policy this year would be to prevent all of the scheduled tax increases and address the spending drivers of the deficit now and over the early months of 2013 . President Obama and Congress then need to implement comprehensive , revenue-neutral reform of the tax code featuring lower marginal tax rates and reduced tax preferences , which in their present form distort decision making and curry favor with the friends of politicians and lobbyists .
Components of Taxmageddon Taxmageddon and the fiscal cliff are not accidents . Over the past two years , President Obama and congressional leaders intentionally pushed the resolution of expiring tax provisions and excessive and unsustainable spending past the November election . In doing so , they added uncertainty to business and financial markets and created this artificial crisis . Taxmageddon , the tax side of the fiscal cliff , involves the expiration of key tax provisions and the beginning of new tax policy . These changes would translate into about a $ 500 billion tax increase in 2013 . [ 6 ] The tax policies expiring on January 2 , 2013 , include : Tax cuts from the 2009 stimulus ;
A 2 percent payroll tax cut ( the “ payroll tax holiday ” ) ;
The estate ( “ death ” ) tax spousal exemption set at $ 5 million and the death tax rate set at 35 percent ;
The full slate of 2001 and 2003 Bush-era tax cuts . The tax provisions mainly affecting high-income earners include : Raising the 33 percent marginal tax rate to 36 percent and the 35 percent rate to 39.6 percent ;
A 3.8 percent Medicare tax on wages and salaries over $ 250,000 ;
The return of the personal exemption phaseout ( PEP ) and the itemizers ’ “ haircut ” ( Pease provision ) ;
Returning to the 1997 estate tax parameters of the $ 1 million exemption threshold with 55 percent rate ; and
Raising the top dividend tax rate from 15 percent to a combined 44.4 percent ( 39.6 percent income tax rate plus the 3.8 percent Medicare surcharge ) and raising the top capital gains tax rate from 15 percent to a combined 23.8 percent ( 20 percent income tax plus 3.8 percent Medicare surcharge ) .
The U.S. faces a fiscal cliff whether the expiration of certain tax rates falls on all income earners or only on high-income earners . [ 7 ] This study uses an economic forecast scenario in which taxes rise only on high-income earners under the President ’ s tax plan ( Obama tax plan ) . [ 8 ] The scenario forecast indicates a substantial decline in income levels ( before and after tax ) ; aggregate hours worked in the economy ; and total output in the U.S. economy relative to baseline levels . [ 9 ]
In particular , the higher marginal tax rates on labor income ( wages and salary ) and higher marginal tax rates on investment income implied by the Obama tax plan significantly reduce the incentive and ability to save , invest , and supply labor in the U.S. economy . The resulting slower growth in the supply of labor and capital services reduces the productive capacity of the U.S. economy in 2013 . This effect increases quickly and persists in the long run . Further , lower rates of private-sector investment reduce the amount of productive capital employed in the U.S. economy , further depressing the forces of economic growth . ( See Text Box : “ Hours Worked in the U.S. Economy . ” )
Specifically , economic growth would slow in 2013 under the Obama tax plan compared with current policy , shaving an average of $ 105 billion ( 0.8 percent ) in 2013 and nearly twice that amount on average over 10 years . [ 10 ] The reduced output and productive capacity in the U.S. economy are reflected in a much weaker labor market in which an average of 1.1 million fewer workers would have jobs each year under the Obama tax plan .
Hours Worked in the U.S. Economy The higher average effective and marginal income tax rates under the Obama tax plan would reduce the incentive to work in the U.S. economy whether the tax rates are raised on all income earners or only on high-income earners . Many high-income individuals earn their income from capital income rather than labor income . There is , after all , good reason that the nation boasts a thriving tax-planning industry . Those who earn primarily labor income have tremendous flexibility to adjust the forms of their compensation as well as their hours . However , at the aggregate level , tax rates can affect the decisions of many individuals who are near the threshold of moving into a high-income earning bracket . [ 11 ] The higher tax rates affect the intensive and extensive margin for labor supply in the economy . Total and private employment levels would decline relative to baseline levels . The reduction in aggregate hours worked in the economy would likely capture the behavior effect of many high-income earners . Relative to baseline levels , total hours worked would decrease by 2 billion . In the context of an average 40-hour work week for the average private-sector ( nonfarm ) worker , this is roughly 0.9 average fewer hours worked per week per worker than in the baseline scenario .
Under the Obama tax plan , the higher tax rates on the returns to capital lead to an immediate decline in capital in the economy . This decline results from a combination of capital destruction [ 12 ] —taking productive capital offline—and cutting the rate of U.S. business investment . In addition , higher marginal tax rates on labor income reduce the saving rate while leaving households with less available income to save , thus slowing growth in private wealth and reducing the ability of U.S. citizens to fund and reap the benefits of domestic investment .
This is not simply a theoretical result . Whether taxes rise on all income earners or only on high-income earners , investment declines significantly and the capital stock shrinks , leading to lower real output in the economy and fewer jobs . Gross private investment would decline an average of $ 126 billion ( 4.12 percent ) per year ; private non-residential fixed investment would decrease an average of $ 43 billion ( 2.2 percent ) per year ; and private residential fixed investment would decline an average of $ 13 billion ( 2.18 percent ) . The capital stock declines an average of $ 229 billion ( 1.2 percent ) per year relative to the baseline over the long run .
The reduced growth of real output in the economy and the consequently lower levels of personal and corporate income translate into smaller tax bases for corporate and personal income taxes . As the incomes of households and businesses are smaller than assumed in the static revenue forecasts , federal tax revenues will likewise be lower than expected . Compared with the evolution of the economy under current policy , fewer jobs , individuals working fewer hours , less investment , and less investment income translate directly into a smaller tax base for the federal government .
The President assumes that his tax proposal would generate $ 1.6 trillion in additional federal revenue , but this projection assumes that tax increases would have no effect whatsoever on the economy . In reality , if the economic effects are considered , the Obama plan to raise taxes on high-income earners would generate only about 44 percent ( $ 680 billion ) of the projected $ 1.6 trillion . [ 13 ]
In 2012 , the federal government ran a $ 1.1 trillion budget deficit—predominantly because of the ongoing weakness in the American economy , which depressed federal receipts—and substantially increased spending during the first years of the Obama Administration . As the President ’ s own budget figures show , as the economy recovers , federal receipts will increase toward 18 percent to 19 percent of GDP , which is the traditional post–World War II share of federal receipts .
America ’ s fiscal imbalances are the result not of a systemic shortfall in revenues , but of dramatically increased federal spending under President Obama . Federal spending threatens to continue climbing as the costs of the major entitlement programs soar .
The January 1 , 2013 , expiration of a wide range of tax policies and resulting unprecedented increase in tax rates and tax burdens would cause substantial economic harm and job loss whether the increases apply to everyone or only to the subset of high-income earners whom the President favors targeting .
After five years of elevated unemployment , the President and congressional leaders should attend to policies that would strengthen the economy , not weaken it further . Rather than debate alternative ways to increase taxes , they should focus on addressing the real source of the nation ’ s fiscal imbalance—entitlement spending—and on reforming the federal tax code to substantially reduce impediments to economic growth .

Taxmageddon was compared with current policy , which is the tax code as it stands including the complete Bush tax cuts , the payroll tax cut , and the AMT patch , as well as the Obama policy , which allows the tax cuts to expire for filers with incomes over $ 200,000 ( filing singly ) or $ 250,000 ( filing jointly ) .

[ 17 ]","Abstract: On January 1, 2013, the Bush tax cuts will expire and other new taxes that congressional leaders have recognized would damage the economy will take effect. President Barack Obama’s proposal to increase taxes on only “high-income earners” would also be economically destructive, reducing economic output by an average of $196 billion per year over 2013–2022 relative to current tax policy. Congress and the President would better serve the country by reforming the tax code in a pro-growth, revenue-neutral way and by reducing federal spending.

Nearly historic increases in federal personal income and payroll taxes combined with modest reductions in federal spending are set to begin on January 1, 2013. This is the “fiscal cliff”: a combination of fiscal policy changes that many analysts believe will send the U.S. economy into a recession.

Understandably, President Barack Obama and congressional leaders in both political parties are seeking a way to avoid this policy-driven cliff. In addressing the fiscal cliff, President Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress have taken the peculiar tack of pushing to increase taxes primarily on “high-income earners” and small businesses,[1] even though these same leaders argue that raising taxes on all earners would damage the economy. Somehow, raising taxes only on high-income earners is supposedly not economically destructive.

This line of reasoning is simply mistaken. The economy will slow significantly whether the federal government raises tax rates on everyone or only on high-income earners.[2] The analysis of the Obama tax plan presented in this paper indicates that the U.S. econoFmy would slow significantly if tax rates on ordinary income, dividend income, and capital gains income rise for high-income earners.

This study uses the Center for Data Analysis’s microsimulation model of the federal individual income tax, which is based on Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data and the IHS Global Insight (GII) short-term U.S. macroeconomic model, to evaluate the economic and budgetary effects of the tax scenarios.[3] We compare the forecast scenario to a baseline forecast scenario representing the indefinite continuation of the current tax policy.

Relative to the economy’s performance under the current policy, we find that total output and income would decline by approximately $105 billion in 2012 and by an average of $196 billion per year over 2013–2022. The decline in economic output is consistent with prevalent recessionary concerns. The slowdown in real output occurs because:

Higher tax rates on investment raise the cost of capital investment, and higher tax rates on labor income reduce the incentive to work and supply labor in the U.S. economy. Over the long run, the decline in private-sector investment would reduce the capital stock, leading to slower output and labor supply in the U.S. economy.

Gross private-sector investment would decline by an average of $126 billion (4.1 percent) per year, reducing real capital stock in the U.S. economy by an average of $229 billion (1.2 percent) per year. The reduction in private-sector investment and capital services over the long run would reduce the labor supply at different economic margins: Private-sector employment in the U.S. economy would fall by an average 1.1 million jobs (1 percent) per year, and Americans would work 2 billion fewer hours relative to baseline levels.

The President believes his tax proposal will increase federal revenue by an average of $160 billion per year. The results of the dynamic simulation indicate that the President’s proposal would achieve only about $68 billion per year—less than one-half of the President’s projection. The dynamic result is due to a smaller tax base commensurate with the smaller economy. For example, fewer hours worked and lower real wages result in less federal income and payroll tax receipts.

We cannot solve the long-run fiscal imbalance with tax increases, especially when tax rate increases would leave the U.S. economy weaker and federal revenues lower than assumed under static forecasts. The best path forward is to achieve fiscal balance by implementing pro-growth, revenue-neutral, fundamental reform of the U.S. tax code and by setting federal discretionary and mandatory spending on a significantly slower trajectory as detailed in The Heritage Foundation’s Saving the American Dream plan.[5]

The U.S. faces a fiscal cliff whether the expiration of certain tax rates falls on all income earners or only on high-income earners.[7] This study uses an economic forecast scenario in which taxes rise only on high-income earners under the President’s tax plan (Obama tax plan).[8] The scenario forecast indicates a substantial decline in income levels (before and after tax); aggregate hours worked in the economy; and total output in the U.S. economy relative to baseline levels.[9]

Static Methodology

Analysts in the Center for Data Analysis (CDA) at The Heritage Foundation used forecasts from the CDA microsimulation model of the federal individual income tax to estimate both the impact of President Obama’s proposed repeal of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts affecting high-income taxpayers and the components of “Taxmageddon.” The CDA tax model simulates the effects of changes in tax law on a representative sample of taxpayers based on IRS Statistics of Income taxpayer microdata, matched with demographic data from the U.S. Census Current Population Survey. Data for base-year taxpayers are extrapolated or “aged” to reflect detailed taxpayer characteristics in future years.

The static comparison of current policy with the current-law expected tax increases (“Taxmageddon”) and the proposal put forth by President Obama (“the Obama plan”) was obtained by running simulations of the current policy baseline and the tax plan and by comparing the differences in revenue, tax rates, and tax increases across income and demographic groups. For each simulation, tax increases were estimated both separately and together (e.g., Taxmageddon). The tax increases were based on the most recent budget proposal and information on the IRS website.[14]

Taxmageddon is the tax system as it will stand in 2013 if no intervening legislation is enacted.

Dynamic Methodology

The analysis employs a version of the IHS Global Insight November 2012 short-term model of the U.S. economy (GII model) to estimate the overall net economic effects relating to the expiration of the tax policies under the Obama tax plan. The relationships in the model are calibrated with historical U.S. data and mainstream economic theory. The model is a tool that provides insight into the likely magnitudes and directions of economic variables due to policy changes. A dynamic analysis of a policy change is important because it accounts for indirect and direct effects to provide a more realistic estimate of the overall economic impact.

We used inputs from the static estimates described in the previous section. The CDA individual income tax model estimates the changes in average marginal tax rates and average effective tax rates, which are then used as parameter values in the GII model. The GII model has a variable measuring the average federal marginal income tax rate, and we used the percent changes from the baseline instead of the actual estimate to minimize the biases in the estimate due to the different baseline values in the micro and dynamic models. The GII model has a variable (stochastic) that measures the average effective federal personal income tax rate. We applied the changes to this series as add-factor adjustments by the percent change estimated in the micro model.[15]

The estate tax is part of the unified budget revenues in the GII model, but it is not counted in the National Income and Product Accounts for government receipts. Thus, an adjustment variable in the GII model reconciles the two government revenue variables, and the static revenue level was applied to this variable.[16] The capital cost adjustment was made by increasing the GII variable that tracks the yield on AAA-related corporate bonds.[17]

Story Continued Below

Trump's advisers are so far floating the same kinds of financing schemes that Congress has batted around for years with little success, including proposals to lure private investors or reap a revenue windfall through an overhaul of the tax code. Key lawmakers say they’re in the dark on how Trump’s plan would work — with some conservatives simply hoping that his call for massive tax breaks will provide an economic jolt that makes the hard spending decisions easier.

Democrats, meanwhile, are split on whether to cooperate with Trump on his plan. Hillary Clinton adviser Ron Klain denounced it Friday as a ""trap"" that would provide ""a massive corporate welfare plan for contractors"" without necessarily spurring any new infrastructure spending.

Even congressional Republicans who have long championed spending on transportation projects say they don’t yet know the details of Trump’s 10-year proposal, which the president-elect has vowed will “put millions of our people to work” while making U.S. infrastructure “second to none.”

""Look, we don't have the details,"" House Transportation Chairman Bill Shuster (R-Pa.) told POLITICO. ""We're working very closely with his transition team and hopefully with the new department head to figure out how we're going to pay for it. It's got to be fiscally responsible.""

A trillion dollars is “a big number,” said Senate Commerce Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.), adding that a tax overhaul could be one promising way to pay for it. “I think it's going to come down to figuring out just actually what's achievable.”

“I think this is critical, something that could draw us together,” said Sen.

There are commonly observed growth effects from cuts in tax rates , but they generally amount to something like 20 percent of the revenue “ lost ” under the static-projection model . Sometimes they have been more than that .

It’s not conservative, but rather a rejection of economic reality.

The Trump-Pence bailout of Carrier’s operations in Indiana provides an illustrative case.

House Speaker John Boehner says all options on spending and revenue are open
While both sides signal a willingness to deal , differences on details remain
The nation faces tax hikes and steep spending cuts at the end of the year
Flush with re-election vigor , President Barack Obama called Friday for House Republicans to immediately pass a bill already approved by the Senate that would maintain current tax rates for middle-class Americans while increasing taxes of wealthier citizens .
In his first public comments since winning Tuesday 's vote , Obama expressed openness to negotiate with Congress on how to deal with pending tax hikes and spending cuts that create the so-called fiscal cliff facing the economy at the end of the year .
However , he also repeated his longstanding demand that Republican opponents to any kind of tax increase relent to the will of the White House and the Senate -- and now the American people -- in letting tax rates increase on income over $ 250,000 .
Nobody in either party wants the middle class , identified as families making less than $ 250,000 a year , to see taxes increase at the end of the year when lower rates set during the administration of former President George W. Bush will expire , Obama said .
`` That makes no sense . It would be bad for the economy , '' he told a White House gathering of what aides described as middle class Americans . `` Let 's extend middle class tax cuts right now . Let 's do that right now . That one step would give millions of families , 98 % of Americans , 97 % of small businesses , the certainty that they need going into the new year . ''
Noting the Senate previously passed a bill to extend the tax cuts to the middle class , but not income over $ 250,000 , Obama said : `` All we need is action from the House . ''
`` I 've got the pen , '' he said , reaching into his pocket to hold one up as the crowd applauded . `` I 'm ready to sign the bill right away . I 'm ready to do it . ''
The president also announced he invited congressional leaders from both parties to the White House next week to launch talks on finding a solution to the fiscal cliff , as well as consensus on how to strike a comprehensive deal to reduce the nation 's chronic federal deficits and debt .
Separately , a bipartisan group of senators known as the `` Gang of Eight '' will reconvene next week to `` assess where they are '' in working out a bipartisan compromise on a long-term deficit agreement , a Senate aide told CNN on Friday . The group 's previous talks have yet to bring a breakthrough .
The gang of eight includes Democrats Mark Warner of Virginia , Dick Durbin of Illinois , Michael Bennet of Colorado and the retiring Kent Conrad of North Dakota , along with Republicans Saxby Chambliss of Georgia , Tom Coburn of Oklahoma , Mike Crapo of Idaho , and Mike Johanns of Nebraska .
While offering to consider unspecified reforms to costly entitlement programs sought by Republicans , Obama ' s initial salvo in what will be a long and tough negotiation signaled he was unwilling to back down on the tax issue that was a central theme of his election campaign .
`` On Tuesday night , we found out that the majority of Americans agree with my approach and that includes Democrats , independents and a lot of Republicans across the country , as well as independent economists and budget experts , '' the president said . `` That 's how you reduce the deficit ; with a balanced approach so our job now is to get a majority in Congress to reflect the will of the American people . ''
Obama and House Speaker John Boehner are positioned as the lead negotiators in a showdown between Democrats and Republicans over the issue identified by voters as a top priority : reducing the chronic federal deficits and debt considered a threat to economic prosperity and national security .
Boehner , R-Ohio , signaled a willingness to deal on Friday but also maintained hard-line GOP opposition to any tax increase .

`` Raising tax rates will slow down our ability to create the jobs everyone says they want , '' Boehner said at a news conference , noting that higher taxes on the wealthy will hit small business owners .
Later , however , he said that `` everything on the revenue side and on the spending side has to be looked at . ''
Boehner also called on Obama to take the lead in offering a workable plan that Republicans can accept but stopped short of providing details , saying : `` I do n't want to limit the options available to me or limit the options that might be available to the White House . ''
Asked if tea party conservatives or others in his caucus might oppose an agreement they do n't like , Boehner responded : `` When the president and I have been able to come to an agreement , there has been no problem in getting it passed here in the House . ''
The brewing political showdown in Washington left U.S. financial markets unconvinced the two sides would resolve their differences and come to an agreement .
All three U.S. stock indexes ended the week more than 2 % lower due to investor concerns about the fiscal cliff 's potential impact on the sluggish economy .
Markets and American business are also concerned that brinksmanship on the deficit could influence the deadline for raising the nation 's debt ceiling and eventually hamper the government 's ability to pay its bills .
The fiscal cliff comprises two main elements : Tax cuts from the administration of President George W. Bush will expire on December 31 , triggering a return to higher Clinton-era rates for everyone .
In addition , $ 1.2 trillion in mandatory across-the-board budget cuts -- known in legislative parlance as the sequester -- will take effect next year unless Congress finds a way to offset that amount in the federal budget . The automatic cuts were intended to motivate legislators to work out an agreement instead of letting the sequester ever actually occur .
Boehner 's leverage in negotiating a deal got weakened by the election that returned Obama to the White House , broadened the Democratic majority in the Senate and slightly narrowed the Republican majority in the House .
While the election resulted in another split Congress like the current session that has become a symbol of legislative dysfunction , both sides have signaled a possible new openness to an agreement that was unreachable in the past two years .
In the final days of the campaign , Vice President Joe Biden referred to private talks with members of Congress on the pending fiscal impacts of expiring tax cuts and mandatory budget cuts . This week , Boehner called on Obama to work with him to complete a comprehensive deficit reduction agreement -- the `` grand bargain '' that eluded them last year .
Both Boehner and Obama were held back from a deal back then because of pressure from their respective bases , retiring Republican Rep. Steve LaTourette of Ohio told CNN .
`` The 'no-tax pledge ' people in the Republican Party yanked Boehner back and the 'do n't you dare touch the middle class ' entitlement people in the president 's party pulled him back , and as a result those talks collapsed , '' LaTourette said .
Boehner said this week that a comprehensive agreement wo n't happen by the end of the year in the lame-duck session of Congress . He proposed that the two sides use that time to set up a framework for substantive negotiations when the new Congress comes in next year while taking short-term steps to avoid the fiscal cliff .

House Speaker John Boehner says all options on spending and revenue are open

While both sides signal a willingness to deal, differences on details remain

The nation faces tax hikes and steep spending cuts at the end of the year

Flush with re-election vigor, President Barack Obama called Friday for House Republicans to immediately pass a bill already approved by the Senate that would maintain current tax rates for middle-class Americans while increasing taxes of wealthier citizens.

In his first public comments since winning Tuesday's vote, Obama expressed openness to negotiate with Congress on how to deal with pending tax hikes and spending cuts that create the so-called fiscal cliff facing the economy at the end of the year.

However, he also repeated his longstanding demand that Republican opponents to any kind of tax increase relent to the will of the White House and the Senate -- and now the American people -- in letting tax rates increase on income over $250,000.

Nobody in either party wants the middle class, identified as families making less than $250,000 a year, to see taxes increase at the end of the year when lower rates set during the administration of former President George W. Bush will expire, Obama said.

""That makes no sense. It would be bad for the economy,"" he told a White House gathering of what aides described as middle class Americans. ""Let's extend middle class tax cuts right now. Let's do that right now. That one step would give millions of families, 98% of Americans, 97% of small businesses, the certainty that they need going into the new year.""

Noting the Senate previously passed a bill to extend the tax cuts to the middle class, but not income over $250,000, Obama said: ""All we need is action from the House.""

""I've got the pen,"" he said, reaching into his pocket to hold one up as the crowd applauded. ""I'm ready to sign the bill right away. I'm ready to do it.""

The president also announced he invited congressional leaders from both parties to the White House next week to launch talks on finding a solution to the fiscal cliff, as well as consensus on how to strike a comprehensive deal to reduce the nation's chronic federal deficits and debt.

Separately, a bipartisan group of senators known as the ""Gang of Eight"" will reconvene next week to ""assess where they are"" in working out a bipartisan compromise on a long-term deficit agreement, a Senate aide told CNN on Friday. The group's previous talks have yet to bring a breakthrough.

The gang of eight includes Democrats Mark Warner of Virginia, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Michael Bennet of Colorado and the retiring Kent Conrad of North Dakota, along with Republicans Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Mike Crapo of Idaho, and Mike Johanns of Nebraska.

Long and tough negotiation

While offering to consider unspecified reforms to costly entitlement programs sought by Republicans, Obama' s initial salvo in what will be a long and tough negotiation signaled he was unwilling to back down on the tax issue that was a central theme of his election campaign.

""On Tuesday night, we found out that the majority of Americans agree with my approach and that includes Democrats, independents and a lot of Republicans across the country, as well as independent economists and budget experts,"" the president said. ""That's how you reduce the deficit; with a balanced approach so our job now is to get a majority in Congress to reflect the will of the American people.""

Obama and House Speaker John Boehner are positioned as the lead negotiators in a showdown between Democrats and Republicans over the issue identified by voters as a top priority: reducing the chronic federal deficits and debt considered a threat to economic prosperity and national security.

Boehner, R-Ohio, signaled a willingness to deal on Friday but also maintained hard-line GOP opposition to any tax increase.

""Raising tax rates will slow down our ability to create the jobs everyone says they want,"" Boehner said at a news conference, noting that higher taxes on the wealthy will hit small business owners.

Later, however, he said that ""everything on the revenue side and on the spending side has to be looked at.""

Boehner also called on Obama to take the lead in offering a workable plan that Republicans can accept but stopped short of providing details, saying: ""I don't want to limit the options available to me or limit the options that might be available to the White House.""

Asked if tea party conservatives or others in his caucus might oppose an agreement they don't like, Boehner responded: ""When the president and I have been able to come to an agreement, there has been no problem in getting it passed here in the House.""

The brewing political showdown in Washington left U.S. financial markets unconvinced the two sides would resolve their differences and come to an agreement.

All three U.S. stock indexes ended the week more than 2% lower due to investor concerns about the fiscal cliff's potential impact on the sluggish economy.

Markets and American business are also concerned that brinksmanship on the deficit could influence the deadline for raising the nation's debt ceiling and eventually hamper the government's ability to pay its bills.

The fiscal cliff comprises two main elements: Tax cuts from the administration of President George W. Bush will expire on December 31, triggering a return to higher Clinton-era rates for everyone.

In addition, $1.2 trillion in mandatory across-the-board budget cuts -- known in legislative parlance as the sequester -- will take effect next year unless Congress finds a way to offset that amount in the federal budget. The automatic cuts were intended to motivate legislators to work out an agreement instead of letting the sequester ever actually occur.

Republican leverage weakened by election results

Boehner's leverage in negotiating a deal got weakened by the election that returned Obama to the White House, broadened the Democratic majority in the Senate and slightly narrowed the Republican majority in the House.

While the election resulted in another split Congress like the current session that has become a symbol of legislative dysfunction, both sides have signaled a possible new openness to an agreement that was unreachable in the past two years.

In the final days of the campaign, Vice President Joe Biden referred to private talks with members of Congress on the pending fiscal impacts of expiring tax cuts and mandatory budget cuts. This week, Boehner called on Obama to work with him to complete a comprehensive deficit reduction agreement -- the ""grand bargain"" that eluded them last year.

Both Boehner and Obama were held back from a deal back then because of pressure from their respective bases, retiring Republican Rep. Steve LaTourette of Ohio told CNN.

""The 'no-tax pledge' people in the Republican Party yanked Boehner back and the 'don't you dare touch the middle class' entitlement people in the president's party pulled him back, and as a result those talks collapsed,"" LaTourette said.

Boehner said this week that a comprehensive agreement won't happen by the end of the year in the lame-duck session of Congress. He proposed that the two sides use that time to set up a framework for substantive negotiations when the new Congress comes in next year while taking short-term steps to avoid the fiscal cliff.

Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the chamber, said such a timetable could work.

""We have a chance in the lame duck to at least start the process, and I think there's a chance to rally bipartisan support,"" he said. ""These are basic issues we can work out, and the president is in a position to do that.""

Both sides agree the best outcome would be a broad deal addressing the overall need for deficit reduction, including reforms to the tax system and entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.

However, they remain far apart on exactly how to forge such an agreement.

Obama campaigned on having wealthy Americans contribute more to deficit reduction efforts, and White House spokesman Jay Carney said Friday that the president will veto any package that extends the Bush tax cuts for income over $250,000.

""We can't just cut our way to prosperity,"" Obama said Friday. ""If we're serious about reducing the deficit, we have to combine spending cuts with revenue and that means asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more in taxes.""

Boehner and Republicans oppose raising taxes on anyone, and instead back a broad reform of the tax system that would lower rates further for everyone while eliminating some deductions and loopholes.

While Boehner said this week that his side was open to increasing revenue from such reforms, he made clear that such increases should come from resulting economic growth instead of higher tax rates.

In essence, Boehner proposed the kind of tax reform championed by failed Republican presidential challenger Mitt Romney, whose plan was criticized by Obama and many economists for being unrealistic in assuming that the combination of closed loopholes and economic growth would equal the lost revenue of tax cuts.

Obama's victory gives him new leverage in the budget battles after Republicans forced the president and Democrats into prolonged and sometimes bitter showdowns in the last two years.

One top Democrat with close ties to leaders on Capitol Hill and the White House said that the imminent expiration of the Bush tax cuts means Obama ""doesn't have to do anything and everyone's taxes go up,"" which is a GOP nightmare.

Such an increase would affect personal income tax, the estate tax, dividends and capital gains taxes.

In an interview Thursday - one day before her vote count lead spurred her opponent to concede the race - Sawant slammed Obama economics , suggested she could live to see the end of U.S. capitalism , and offered a socialist vision for transforming Boeing . A condensed version of our conversation follows .
It appears you ’ re on the cusp of winning a major city ’ s council race as a socialist . How did that happen ?
I think the basis for everything that ’ s happening in Seattle , and everywhere else , is the fallout of the economic crisis … In Seattle , we are seeing a city that is very wealthy but is very unequal , and has become unaffordable for the vast majority of people …
Along with our [ state Legislature ] campaign last year and [ city council ] this year , we ’ ve seen a movement towards $ 15 an hour through the fast food movement … workers have courageously gone out on one-day strikes … The workers of [ nearby airport city ] SeaTac and the labor movement , they put a $ 15 an hour minimum wage initiative on the ballot for SeaTac city , and that is now leading …
All of this is happening in the cauldron of the economic crisis and the burden placed on the shoulders of working people … The conditions that shape people ’ s consciousness in Seattle are not different from anywhere else . And in fact , there is a deep frustration and disgust with the political system … This is the background in which our campaign has had a resounding echo .
After the 2008 financial crash , were you disappointed that there wasn ’ t more of a left turn in U.S. policy at the national level ?
I think it ’ s been it ’ s been demoralizing for the left for a while . But at the same time , I think what we ’ re seeing is a slow but steady change , and the Occupy movement was a really significant expression of the disenchantment from the system that we knew that everybody was feeling…
In the absence of movements , especially mass movements , people tend to feel atomized , and everybody is privately thinking that “ the system is not working for me. ” The Occupy movement , what it did was it ended that silence and people were more openly talking about the economic crisis , the fact that the banks got bailed out and the rest of us were left with unemployment , low-wage jobs , and an epidemic of foreclosures and evictions . So I think , contrary to what people thought…It ’ s really been a period where newer , small but new movements are starting to rise up . There ’ s been the Occupy Homes campaign in Minnesota , which has actually prevented several foreclosures…And there ’ s been sort of initial eruptions of the environmental movement .
…Now , what [ the ] Left has to do is to recognize that there is an opening here , there is a hunger among people in the United States , especially young people , young working people…In reality , what has become a dirty word is capitalism . Young people can see that the system does not offer any solutions . They can see that a two-party system is not working for them . But what is the alternative ? We have to provide the alternative…
Boeing workers…rejected this contract that has been forced on them by Boeing executives [ who are ] holding the state hostage to their demands…Every few years Boeing demands a massive corporate giveaway from the state , and the state each time gives into it - and this is a Democratic governor of the state who was leading this effort . For Boeing workers , it ’ s very clear that neither of the two parties is going to stand by them . And so the signal that it sends to the labor movement is that we have to have our own political organization .
So what is the most likely path in your view to making the United States more socialist ?
I wouldn ’ t call it “ more socialist , ” in the sense that it doesn ’ t make sense : It can be either capitalism or socialism . But what we can do , in the journey toward making the economy into something that works for everybody : We have to fight for major reforms under capitalism … We are going to be pushing forward for $ 15 an hour minimum wage in Seattle in 2014 …
The only way we can get that any of these demands to be fulfilled is if we have mass movements of workers and young people coming together in an organized way and demanding these reforms …
But we also have to be honest … That ’ s not going to be enough . Because the system itself is a system of crises … Capitalism does not have the ability to generate the kind of living wage jobs that will be necessary in order to sustain a decent standard of living for the majority … So we have to have a strategy where we not only fight for every reform that we can get , including single payer healthcare , but … It can ’ t be in isolation from also thinking about fundamental shift in society …
In all this discussion , we can not ignore the questions about climate change that are looming large in terms of this . And capitalism has shown itself completely incapable of addressing this crisis . And in some ways that ’ s as compelling a reason as any to think about a fundamental shift .
Do you believe that capitalism can or will end in the United States in your lifetime ?
I ca n't give a definitive answer to that because it will depend on what role we play – you know , we as in working people , young people , older people , people who have a stake in changing society , you know – it ’ s in our hands … We have to point the way forward , and that is the responsibility of the left , and we ’ re trying to do that . But we need other forces to step in .
We need the labor movement to play a huge role in this . And you know , one of the things that the labor movement can do is it can join hands with the environmental movement … The other thing the labor movement needs to do is run their own candidates , independent of the two parties , independent of corporate money , and show that it ’ s possible .
I mean , our campaign has shown that you don ’ t have to obey the rules .
In the best case scenario for you , the day that capitalism ended in the United States -- how would that happen , what form would that transition take ?
It would be difficult for me to lay out a blueprint of that . But … we can think about what it will require …
Capitalism is a system where it ’ s extremely productive , and productivity rates are at an all-time high , but the gains of the productivity are delivered almost exclusively to a very tiny elite at the top …
Boeing has an enormous factory , [ as well as ] all the auto factories that are lying defunct right now in the U.S. -- they all have enormous capacity for production . And there ’ s any number of workers with the skills , and people who have the potential of learning those skills . And instead we have a situation where , because we don ’ t have a say in the production , either the machines are lying idle , or the machines are being used to produce destructive machines like drones .
So what we need to do is to take the machines and the factories into democratic , say , democratic ownership -- and the workers can contribute rail cars or buses , something like that , something that is beneficial to society . And that ’ s something that creates jobs -- it will create living wage jobs …
That ’ s the kind of system that we need , where the decisions on what to do with resources , and what to produce , how much of it to produce , that is made in accordance with democratic principles , and in accordance with what human society needs , not because the Wal-Mart CEO needs to make 2 percentage points more profits this quarter .
Under that vision of socialism , would there still be a Seattle City Council ?
Absolutely . There has to be elected representation . There would still be unions . There has to be accountability .
What will change is how democracy actually functions . I mean , today we have a certain level of democracy -- I mean , when you look at the vote , that ’ s true . And we are running within the system . But it ’ s a very limited form of democracy . You know , in order to get your message across , if you are a campaign with loads of corporate money , it ’ s easier for you . If you ’ re going against the status quo , it ’ s harder … And voters themselves are disenfranchised in so many ways …
Democracy is nonetheless absolutely the bedrock of socialism . In fact , I would say that democracy is absolutely critical for this vision to come alive . And in fact democracy is antithetical in many ways to capitalism . And in fact this democracy that we have is something that allows us to do a little bit within the system , but that ’ s not what the capitalist class want . I mean , they do not want us to fight for $ 15 an hour , they don ’ t want to give that . But we ’ re able to fight for it within the system . But that ’ s despite capitalism , not because of capitalism .
President Obama told the Business Roundtable – speaking of “ the capitalist class ” – in his first term that he ’ s an “ ardent believer in the free market , ” and that he sees three roles for government : to create rules for a level playing field ; to provide things that individuals can ’ t do for themselves ; and to provide a social safety net . What do you make of that kind of politics ?
First of all , I think Obama is being quite honest … he believes in capitalism . And so for people to have the faith that he is going to really fight against those ideas … there is no basis in reality for that …
I would say that the “ free market ” is basically free for the super-wealthy , and extremely un-free for the rest of us . Because they dictate the terms . And so this idea that the free market can generate conditions where social programs can thrive and a level playing field can be created -- it is an oxymoron . Because what the capitalist market does – and that ’ s what they call the “ free market ” – is that if you are a big player , like one of the oil companies , then you are in the best position to consolidate your wealth even further ... One of the systematic , statistical realities under capitalism is intergenerational transmission of wealth and intergenerational transmissions of poverty …
I often ask my students , “ What do you think is the best way of making money under capitalism ? ” They often give me interesting answers , like maybe [ creating ] an app for an iPhone … I tell them , “ Look , the best way of making money under capitalism is to have money in the first place ” …
You also hear people saying , well , it ’ s “ crony capitalism ” or it ’ s “ disaster capitalism ” or some other capitalism . Well , the fact is , you know , they ’ re all dancing around [ that ] this is capitalism … It ’ s not built into the system that the goal is to ensure that socially responsible life is possible . The goal is to maximize profits for those who already have wealth …
The reality is that capitalism rewards the biggest corporations and it tends toward monopoly . That is what capitalism is .
If you end up on the city council , how different is your agenda on the council and your voting record going to be from the liberal Democrats on the Seattle City Council ?
Most of them are typical , homogenous block of more pro-Big Business conservative advocates , although in name they ’ re all Democrats … Seattle , like most major cities of the United States , is ruled by the Democratic Party establishment . And all of the problems that we see here , you know , crisis of affordable housing , low-wage jobs and all of those things , lie at the doorstep of the Democratic Party …
One [ example ] was a vote on whether the city should allow regulated homeless encampments … a very necessary stopgap measure to protect families from the ravages of homelessness . And my opponent … was the fifth vote that crushed it …
Another example -- this is also politically really instructive -- is the paid sick leave for Seattle workers … That was possible because rank-and-file workers and the labor movement took it on themselves -- I mean , they were the ones who championed it . They were out on the streets demonstrating and demanding that the council pass a paid sick leave initiative … That , in combination with the fact that there are one or two more progressive voices on City Council who took that on and pushed for it , ensured that basically the issue was passed … My opponent [ cast the ] sole vote against it . That one thing should be enough for people to not elect him again , because that was a completely unconscionable thing to do…
When we launched our campaign , and it was early this year , no one else was talking about $ 15 an hour except for us and the fast food workers , and all the corporate candidates -- including the mayoral candidates -- were very , very carefully avoiding it … Ultimately , it was impossible for the corporate candidates to ignore , and toward the end of the campaign you had both of the mayoral candidates putting on paper that they support $ 15 an hour …
What I can do on the City Council as one socialist is really far more than what people imagine it to be . Because it won ’ t just be my voice … to talk to other council members , but it ’ s also going to be to continue to really encourage and to invite public pressure into it . Which is how this camp succeeded .
Are there countries that you look to as good examples of socialism ?
There is no real full example … but there are elements of what we are talking about in our vision for a future society ...
In the United States , the creation of the welfare program in the first place . The creation of Social Security . All the advances that have been made in women ’ s rights and LGBT rights -- a lot of this is well within the vision of what I would consider a really humane society in the future , and what I consider socialism … The gains that we have today are very consistent with our vision for a socialist society , and also they came about because a lot of these movements were headed by socialists .
And there are elements of socialism or socialist society in many other countries as well . So if you look at Finland and the funding for public education , how strong the teachers ’ unions are , the full funding for healthcare in Cuba , also education . These are all elements that we would want to see put in place in a future society .
But at the end of the day , it ’ s not possible to have socialism in one country … If resources are organized globally along capitalist lines , it ’ s just not possible to provide that really high standard of living that some people have to everybody else …
[ A ] small section of the working class has attained a really good standard of living . But first of all , that was not delivered to the vast majority . And secondly , and more importantly , those kinds of living are starting to disappear … It ’ s a politics of austerity in Europe , and all of these programs are under major assault . And so that shows you that you can ’ t have socialism in one country , and you can ’ t stop at social democracy . You can ’ t stop at having reforms … We have to have a fundamental shift .
In the past few decades , has the United States been moving closer toward that ideal of socialism , or further away from it ?
As far as what has been happening broadly in the economy , no , it hasn ’ t been moving closer to socialism . And in fact what ’ s been happening is that some of the gains of the post-Second World War era , the creation of the middle class , for example , the funding for public education , a lot of these things are under attack … You don ’ t have to be a socialist economist for someone to admit that the middle class is fast disappearing . You know , Paul Krugman talks about it . So that ’ s going in the wrong direction .
What it shows is that , you know , when there is a major crisis in capitalism , the people who are going to be squeezed are working people .
When did you become a socialist and what brought you to socialism ?
Consciously , I became a socialist when I came to Seattle , and I just happened to attend a meeting where somebody from Socialist Alternative gave a speech . And for me , there was -- that was exactly what I was looking for . And I haven ’ t looked back since then .
But I would say more accurately that I have always been a socialist , but less consciously . From my very childhood , it was just the experience of growing up in Mumbai , India , and seeing just the ocean of poverty and misery all around me . And for me , it was not simply a question of outrage or fellow-feeling . Of course that ’ s the starting point , but for me it ’ s a logical question as well . Which is : How is it possible that there is so much wealth in society , and you can see that there are so many wealthy people who are just wealthy beyond measure , and you have such unimaginable poverty and misery , and just absolute horrendous conditions that human beings are living in …
It just seemed very , just unacceptable to me logically that that situation was a natural one . I mean , I could see that it had nothing to do with resources or productivity . It was clearly a political obstacle to eliminating poverty .","On November 5, Seattle voters made Occupy activist and economics professor Kshama Sawant the first avowed socialist city council member in their city's history – and the country’s first big city socialist council member in decades.

There’s been the Occupy Homes campaign in Minnesota, which has actually prevented several foreclosures…And there’s been sort of initial eruptions of the environmental movement.

…Now, what [the] Left has to do is to recognize that there is an opening here, there is a hunger among people in the United States, especially young people, young working people…In reality, what has become a dirty word is capitalism. Young people can see that the system does not offer any solutions. They can see that a two-party system is not working for them. But what is the alternative? We have to provide the alternative…

Boeing workers…rejected this contract that has been forced on them by Boeing executives [who are] holding the state hostage to their demands…Every few years Boeing demands a massive corporate giveaway from the state, and the state each time gives into it - and this is a Democratic governor of the state who was leading this effort. For Boeing workers, it’s very clear that neither of the two parties is going to stand by them. And so the signal that it sends to the labor movement is that we have to have our own political organization.

So what is the most likely path in your view to making the United States more socialist?

I wouldn’t call it “more socialist,” in the sense that it doesn’t make sense: It can be either capitalism or socialism. But what we can do, in the journey toward making the economy into something that works for everybody: We have to fight for major reforms under capitalism … We are going to be pushing forward for $15 an hour minimum wage in Seattle in 2014 …

The only way we can get that any of these demands to be fulfilled is if we have mass movements of workers and young people coming together in an organized way and demanding these reforms …

But we also have to be honest … That’s not going to be enough. Because the system itself is a system of crises … Capitalism does not have the ability to generate the kind of living wage jobs that will be necessary in order to sustain a decent standard of living for the majority … So we have to have a strategy where we not only fight for every reform that we can get, including single payer healthcare, but … It can’t be in isolation from also thinking about fundamental shift in society …

In all this discussion, we cannot ignore the questions about climate change that are looming large in terms of this. And capitalism has shown itself completely incapable of addressing this crisis. And in some ways that’s as compelling a reason as any to think about a fundamental shift.

Do you believe that capitalism can or will end in the United States in your lifetime?

I can't give a definitive answer to that because it will depend on what role we play – you know, we as in working people, young people, older people, people who have a stake in changing society, you know – it’s in our hands … We have to point the way forward, and that is the responsibility of the left, and we’re trying to do that. But we need other forces to step in.

We need the labor movement to play a huge role in this. And you know, one of the things that the labor movement can do is it can join hands with the environmental movement … The other thing the labor movement needs to do is run their own candidates, independent of the two parties, independent of corporate money, and show that it’s possible.

I mean, our campaign has shown that you don’t have to obey the rules.

In the best case scenario for you, the day that capitalism ended in the United States -- how would that happen, what form would that transition take?

Advertisement:

It would be difficult for me to lay out a blueprint of that. But … we can think about what it will require …

Capitalism is a system where it’s extremely productive, and productivity rates are at an all-time high, but the gains of the productivity are delivered almost exclusively to a very tiny elite at the top …

Boeing has an enormous factory, [as well as] all the auto factories that are lying defunct right now in the U.S. -- they all have enormous capacity for production. And there’s any number of workers with the skills, and people who have the potential of learning those skills. And instead we have a situation where, because we don’t have a say in the production, either the machines are lying idle, or the machines are being used to produce destructive machines like drones.

So what we need to do is to take the machines and the factories into democratic, say, democratic ownership -- and the workers can contribute rail cars or buses, something like that, something that is beneficial to society. And that’s something that creates jobs -- it will create living wage jobs …

That’s the kind of system that we need, where the decisions on what to do with resources, and what to produce, how much of it to produce, that is made in accordance with democratic principles, and in accordance with what human society needs, not because the Wal-Mart CEO needs to make 2 percentage points more profits this quarter.

Under that vision of socialism, would there still be a Seattle City Council?

Absolutely. There has to be elected representation. There would still be unions. There has to be accountability.

What will change is how democracy actually functions. I mean, today we have a certain level of democracy -- I mean, when you look at the vote, that’s true. And we are running within the system. But it’s a very limited form of democracy. You know, in order to get your message across, if you are a campaign with loads of corporate money, it’s easier for you. If you’re going against the status quo, it’s harder … And voters themselves are disenfranchised in so many ways …

Democracy is nonetheless absolutely the bedrock of socialism. In fact, I would say that democracy is absolutely critical for this vision to come alive. And in fact democracy is antithetical in many ways to capitalism. And in fact this democracy that we have is something that allows us to do a little bit within the system, but that’s not what the capitalist class want. I mean, they do not want us to fight for $15 an hour, they don’t want to give that. But we’re able to fight for it within the system. But that’s despite capitalism, not because of capitalism.

President Obama told the Business Roundtable – speaking of “the capitalist class” – in his first term that he’s an “ardent believer in the free market,” and that he sees three roles for government: to create rules for a level playing field; to provide things that individuals can’t do for themselves; and to provide a social safety net. What do you make of that kind of politics?

First of all, I think Obama is being quite honest … he believes in capitalism. And so for people to have the faith that he is going to really fight against those ideas … there is no basis in reality for that …

I would say that the “free market” is basically free for the super-wealthy, and extremely un-free for the rest of us. Because they dictate the terms. And so this idea that the free market can generate conditions where social programs can thrive and a level playing field can be created -- it is an oxymoron. Because what the capitalist market does – and that’s what they call the “free market” – is that if you are a big player, like one of the oil companies, then you are in the best position to consolidate your wealth even further ... One of the systematic, statistical realities under capitalism is intergenerational transmission of wealth and intergenerational transmissions of poverty …

I often ask my students, “What do you think is the best way of making money under capitalism?” They often give me interesting answers, like maybe [creating] an app for an iPhone … I tell them, “Look, the best way of making money under capitalism is to have money in the first place” …

You also hear people saying, well, it’s “crony capitalism” or it’s “disaster capitalism” or some other capitalism. Well, the fact is, you know, they’re all dancing around [that] this is capitalism … It’s not built into the system that the goal is to ensure that socially responsible life is possible. The goal is to maximize profits for those who already have wealth …

The reality is that capitalism rewards the biggest corporations and it tends toward monopoly. That is what capitalism is.

If you end up on the city council, how different is your agenda on the council and your voting record going to be from the liberal Democrats on the Seattle City Council?

Most of them are typical, homogenous block of more pro-Big Business conservative advocates, although in name they’re all Democrats … Seattle, like most major cities of the United States, is ruled by the Democratic Party establishment. And all of the problems that we see here, you know, crisis of affordable housing, low-wage jobs and all of those things, lie at the doorstep of the Democratic Party …

One [example] was a vote on whether the city should allow regulated homeless encampments … a very necessary stopgap measure to protect families from the ravages of homelessness. And my opponent … was the fifth vote that crushed it …

Another example -- this is also politically really instructive -- is the paid sick leave for Seattle workers … That was possible because rank-and-file workers and the labor movement took it on themselves -- I mean, they were the ones who championed it. They were out on the streets demonstrating and demanding that the council pass a paid sick leave initiative … That, in combination with the fact that there are one or two more progressive voices on City Council who took that on and pushed for it, ensured that basically the issue was passed … My opponent [cast the] sole vote against it. That one thing should be enough for people to not elect him again, because that was a completely unconscionable thing to do…

When we launched our campaign, and it was early this year, no one else was talking about $15 an hour except for us and the fast food workers, and all the corporate candidates -- including the mayoral candidates -- were very, very carefully avoiding it … Ultimately, it was impossible for the corporate candidates to ignore, and toward the end of the campaign you had both of the mayoral candidates putting on paper that they support $15 an hour …

What I can do on the City Council as one socialist is really far more than what people imagine it to be. Because it won’t just be my voice … to talk to other council members, but it’s also going to be to continue to really encourage and to invite public pressure into it. Which is how this camp succeeded.

Are there countries that you look to as good examples of socialism?

There is no real full example … but there are elements of what we are talking about in our vision for a future society ...

In the United States, the creation of the welfare program in the first place. The creation of Social Security. All the advances that have been made in women’s rights and LGBT rights -- a lot of this is well within the vision of what I would consider a really humane society in the future, and what I consider socialism … The gains that we have today are very consistent with our vision for a socialist society, and also they came about because a lot of these movements were headed by socialists.

And there are elements of socialism or socialist society in many other countries as well. So if you look at Finland and the funding for public education, how strong the teachers’ unions are, the full funding for healthcare in Cuba, also education. These are all elements that we would want to see put in place in a future society.

But at the end of the day, it’s not possible to have socialism in one country … If resources are organized globally along capitalist lines, it’s just not possible to provide that really high standard of living that some people have to everybody else …

[A] small section of the working class has attained a really good standard of living. But first of all, that was not delivered to the vast majority. And secondly, and more importantly, those kinds of living are starting to disappear … It’s a politics of austerity in Europe, and all of these programs are under major assault. And so that shows you that you can’t have socialism in one country, and you can’t stop at social democracy. You can’t stop at having reforms … We have to have a fundamental shift.

In the past few decades, has the United States been moving closer toward that ideal of socialism, or further away from it?

As far as what has been happening broadly in the economy, no, it hasn’t been moving closer to socialism. And in fact what’s been happening is that some of the gains of the post-Second World War era, the creation of the middle class, for example, the funding for public education, a lot of these things are under attack … You don’t have to be a socialist economist for someone to admit that the middle class is fast disappearing. You know, Paul Krugman talks about it. So that’s going in the wrong direction.

What it shows is that, you know, when there is a major crisis in capitalism, the people who are going to be squeezed are working people.

When did you become a socialist and what brought you to socialism?

Consciously, I became a socialist when I came to Seattle, and I just happened to attend a meeting where somebody from Socialist Alternative gave a speech. And for me, there was -- that was exactly what I was looking for. And I haven’t looked back since then.

But I would say more accurately that I have always been a socialist, but less consciously. From my very childhood, it was just the experience of growing up in Mumbai, India, and seeing just the ocean of poverty and misery all around me. And for me, it was not simply a question of outrage or fellow-feeling. Of course that’s the starting point, but for me it’s a logical question as well. Which is: How is it possible that there is so much wealth in society, and you can see that there are so many wealthy people who are just wealthy beyond measure, and you have such unimaginable poverty and misery, and just absolute horrendous conditions that human beings are living in …

It just seemed very, just unacceptable to me logically that that situation was a natural one. I mean, I could see that it had nothing to do with resources or productivity. It was clearly a political obstacle to eliminating poverty.",www.salon.com,left,labQFE85TYax0Xzh

What a deal ! There are great jobs all around that lovely Bay Area city , the heart of Silicon Valley and home to prestigious Stanford University . But imagine the income one would need to , say , put $ 700,000 down and make a $ 13,000 monthly housing payment .
Palo Alto is near the top of the food chain , but California ’ s coastal housing prices — even in run-down and dangerous cities — typically top a half-million bucks . And those median prices will get you a cottage or a little condo with a view of the freeway . Bay Area friends — even ones with $ 150,000-plus incomes — live with roommates or rack up 35,000 miles a year commuting in bumper-to-bumper misery from the boondocks . Southern California isn ’ t much better .
Fortunately , the U.S. Census Bureau has taken that reality into account in its supplemental formula for determining the nation ’ s poverty rates . Its recently released data show a significant uptick in household income ( 5.2 percent ) since 2014 and a slight drop ( 1.2 percent ) in the poverty rate . But in high-cost-of-living states , particularly California , those numbers were far less encouraging . Despite its reputation for wealth , California once again had the highest poverty rate in the nation , with nearly 21 percent of its residents unable to afford the basics .
California ’ s leaders are proud of their continual efforts to expand the number of welfare-type programs available to residents . In fact , the Census Bureau points to all the many governmental assistance programs that boost poor Californians ’ take-home income . Even if one supports those wealth-transfer programs , it ’ s clear they don ’ t come anywhere close to alleviating problems caused by the state ’ s housing prices .
The governor and Democratic legislators “ raised the state ’ s minimum wage , improved overtime pay for farm and domestic workers , enacted an earned-income tax credit , expanded health and welfare benefits , and provided extra money for the educations of poor students , ” explained the Sacramento Bee ’ s Dan Walters . But they failed “ to confront the heaviest burden on poor families , ” which is of course the state ’ s “ soaring housing costs . ”
Many of the coastal liberals I know blame the housing problems on the desirability of living in some of California ’ s magnificent coastal enclaves , but that argument has been so thoroughly debunked it ’ s silly to even bring it up any more . Yes , it ’ s always going to cost more to buy a house in Santa Barbara or La Jolla than Fresno or El Centro , but the housing-price problem is almost entirely the result of state and local government policy .
All of these coastal enclaves are surrounded by vast amounts of open space , almost all of it off limits to development . As I ’ ve reported for the Spectator , 40 percent of the price of a new single-family home in the San Diego area is attributed to government fees and permits . That regulatory cost — around $ 260,000 — is about 20 percent more than the median home price in the United States . Is it any wonder poor people struggle to live here ? And consider the cost of land , which is driven up by the artificial scarcity of developable acreage . I know developers who have spent decades just trying to get a single project entitled .
In the Bay Area , officials are blaming Airbnb and its small number of units rented out to vacationers for reduced housing supply . They also blame booming tech companies for creating new high-paying jobs that increase demand for housing . That ’ s a novel approach — punish companies that create good jobs because they increase demand for housing !
Yet San Francisco alone has thousands of vacant rental units that will never be put on the open market . That because the city ’ s rent-control law essentially gives renters the right to live there forever at below-market rates . You get less of what you punish and San Francisco severely punishes “ greedy ” landlords for offering apartment units for rent .
And the problem is about to get worse . I ’ ve heard policymakers argue there ’ s no more room to build in San Francisco . That ’ s nonsense . There are plenty of underdeveloped areas even in that densely populated city and developers can always build upward . But even if that were true , the argument ignores that housing markets are regional . If developers could more easily build subdivisions in suburban areas , it would reduce the price pressure across the region and lead to a more reasonable situation even in tony San Francisco .
Instead , smaller cities are emulating the failed policies of bigger ones . Six suburban Bay Area cities have rent-control measures on the November ballot . As the San Francisco Chronicle reported , rents throughout the region have gone up 66 percent , or $ 1,000 a month , since 2010 . That ’ s driving angst among the area ’ s residents . The reason is a lack of building , something educated Bay Area voters ought to figure out . Knowing them , however , they will “ solve ” the problem by making it far worse .
Even the liberal Chronicle focused on overwhelming opposition to rent control by economists , noting that 81 percent of those surveyed disagreed that rent control has “ improved the quantity and quality of affordable rental housing. ” The article pointed to the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst ’ s Office , which concluded rent control results “ in a decline in the overall quality of a community ’ s housing stock. ” That ’ s no doubt true , although the Bay Area ’ s embrace of insanity certainly will help values in the bedraggled Central Valley .
That ’ s the farm region where wannabe homeowners from the Bay Area move , and there ’ s an incredible flight of them over the coastal ranges .

economic_policy,NPR Online News,1,http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/06/09/411352663/heres-how-inflation-has-eroded-american-workers-overtime-eligibility,Here's How Inflation Has Eroded American Workers' Overtime Eligibility,2015-06-09,Danielle Kurtzleben,"President Obama is once again poised to go it alone on labor policy , this time on overtime . The Labor Department is expected in the coming weeks to release a rule making millions more Americans eligible for overtime work — currently , all workers earning below $ 455 a week , or $ 23,660 a year , are guaranteed time-and-a-half pay for working more than 40 hours a week . The law may raise that as high as $ 52,000 , Politico reports .
The rule would also change the regulations outlining which employees earning above that threshold are eligible — currently , employers can exempt some employees above that threshold if those workers could be considered `` white collar . ''
This would add to a series of workplace policies that , failing congressional approval , the president has expanded in limited form through executive order — upping the minimum wage among federal contractors and attempting to shrink the gender wage gap among federal contractors . He also mandated paid leave for federal workers .
This particular rule change would be a long time in coming — Obama had in March 2014 directed the Labor Department to overhaul the overtime regulations .
The overtime threshold has only been changed once since 1975 . At that time , it was set at $ 250 per week . Then in 2004 , President George W. Bush updated it to $ 455 . And that means inflation has slowly diminished the share of Americans who are guaranteed eligibility .
When you adjust for inflation , you can see how much the threshold has fallen — data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve ( going back to 1979 ) show that , as of the late 1970s , the threshold was right at or slightly above the median worker 's pay level . Today , it 's at around half .
The income line in the chart — that top one — represents the exact middle wage , with half the full-time working population above and below it at any given time . So while the threshold fell away from the median pay level , so did the number of workers legally guaranteed overtime pay .
Indeed , according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute , as of 2013 , only 11 percent of full-time workers were guaranteed overtime . Bumping the threshold up to around $ 50,000 , for example — roughly where it was in 1975 , adjusted for inflation — would bring 47 percent of workers under the threshold , making around 6 million more workers eligible , by one estimate .
The debate over the overtime threshold sounds remarkably similar to the minimum-wage debate — in that debate , opponents in the business community say a higher wage would cost jobs . In the debate over overtime , the fear is that it could cost workers hours as employers decide they do n't want to shell out time-and-a-half pay .
And as in the minimum-wage debate , advocates of higher overtime thresholds say lawmakers should simply index the level to inflation — not only would it save lawmakers from periodic fights over how much to change the law , but it would also help lower-paid hourly workers by making sure they 're all paid fairly by keeping wage policies consistent with where prices go .
`` The original notion was that the people who do n't control their own hours , who need the protection of the law , get paid overtime , '' says Ross Eisenbrey , vice president at EPI . `` Where the law set the threshold in 1975 , that 's really supposed to demarcate the people about whom there 's no question — they are not the most powerful people . ''
Tying the level to inflation , he says , would ensure that the workers who need the overtime are consistently eligible for it .
The threshold has never been tied to inflation , and advocates like Eisenbrey and the liberal Center for American Progress have long pushed for such a change .
But opponents see reason to keep the level static . One reason , says one economist , is that an indexed overtime level does n't give businesses enough leeway to deal with high inflation .
`` I think it 's a bad idea [ to index the overtime threshold to inflation ] because you want to preserve some flexibility , '' says Michael Strain , a resident scholar at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute . `` We have been in a low-inflation environment for some time , and we 're kind of used to that in how we look at things .

President Obama is once again poised to go it alone on labor policy, this time on overtime. The Labor Department is expected in the coming weeks to release a rule making millions more Americans eligible for overtime work — currently, all workers earning below $455 a week, or $23,660 a year, are guaranteed time-and-a-half pay for working more than 40 hours a week. The law may raise that as high as $52,000, Politico reports.

The rule would also change the regulations outlining which employees earning above that threshold are eligible — currently, employers can exempt some employees above that threshold if those workers could be considered ""white collar.""

This would add to a series of workplace policies that, failing congressional approval, the president has expanded in limited form through executive order — upping the minimum wage among federal contractors and attempting to shrink the gender wage gap among federal contractors. He also mandated paid leave for federal workers.

This particular rule change would be a long time in coming — Obama had in March 2014 directed the Labor Department to overhaul the overtime regulations.

The overtime threshold has only been changed once since 1975. At that time, it was set at $250 per week. Then in 2004, President George W. Bush updated it to $455. And that means inflation has slowly diminished the share of Americans who are guaranteed eligibility.

When you adjust for inflation, you can see how much the threshold has fallen — data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve (going back to 1979) show that, as of the late 1970s, the threshold was right at or slightly above the median worker's pay level. Today, it's at around half.

The income line in the chart — that top one — represents the exact middle wage, with half the full-time working population above and below it at any given time. So while the threshold fell away from the median pay level, so did the number of workers legally guaranteed overtime pay.

Indeed, according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, as of 2013, only 11 percent of full-time workers were guaranteed overtime. Bumping the threshold up to around $50,000, for example — roughly where it was in 1975, adjusted for inflation — would bring 47 percent of workers under the threshold, making around 6 million more workers eligible, by one estimate.

The debate over the overtime threshold sounds remarkably similar to the minimum-wage debate — in that debate, opponents in the business community say a higher wage would cost jobs. In the debate over overtime, the fear is that it could cost workers hours as employers decide they don't want to shell out time-and-a-half pay.

And as in the minimum-wage debate, advocates of higher overtime thresholds say lawmakers should simply index the level to inflation — not only would it save lawmakers from periodic fights over how much to change the law, but it would also help lower-paid hourly workers by making sure they're all paid fairly by keeping wage policies consistent with where prices go.

""The original notion was that the people who don't control their own hours, who need the protection of the law, get paid overtime,"" says Ross Eisenbrey, vice president at EPI. ""Where the law set the threshold in 1975, that's really supposed to demarcate the people about whom there's no question — they are not the most powerful people.""

Tying the level to inflation, he says, would ensure that the workers who need the overtime are consistently eligible for it.

The threshold has never been tied to inflation, and advocates like Eisenbrey and the liberal Center for American Progress have long pushed for such a change.

But opponents see reason to keep the level static. One reason, says one economist, is that an indexed overtime level doesn't give businesses enough leeway to deal with high inflation.

""I think it's a bad idea [to index the overtime threshold to inflation] because you want to preserve some flexibility,"" says Michael Strain, a resident scholar at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. ""We have been in a low-inflation environment for some time, and we're kind of used to that in how we look at things. But it's entirely conceivable that 10 years from now, we may be in a different environment.""

And without that flexibility, employers might further restrict hours, or they might pressure employees to get even more work done in their 40 hours.

Another argument is that inflation isn't uniform everywhere. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce argued in a February letter to Secretary of Labor Tom Perez that the price index used to adjust wages is based on prices in urban areas — it could distort labor markets in rural areas.

But then, inflation will still happen, and the threshold would still periodically have to rise. So how do you ensure that Congress does it? Strain says one solution could be including a provision in the overtime law that forces Congress to revisit the policy every few years. That way, the policy isn't on ""autopilot,"" he says, but it still changes regularly.

Even then, however, there's no guarantee Congress would actually regularly change the law. After all, it has an annual deadline to pass a budget. It hasn't passed all its spending bills on time in almost 20 years.",www.npr.org,center,30vTGa7UyrazgLIm

Bubble talk is bubbling up on the presidential campaign trail.

Nobody on Wall Street disputes that the stock market is pricey by historic standards. But are stocks — juiced by the Federal Reserve’s low interest rate policy — in a “big, fat, ugly bubble” that will end badly as Donald Trump warned at the first presidential debate?

Trump, the Republican nominee, isn’t the first person to warn of a bubble. Nor is he the first to cite super-loose Fed policy as the root cause. Bubble talk has been circulating since last September, when billionaire investor Carl Icahn warned of “danger ahead” and told CNBC: “We’re in a bubble.” Since then, other heavyweights, including real estate titan Sam Zell, bond king Jeffrey Gundlach of DoubleLine Capital and former hedge fund titan Stanley Druckenmiller, have warned that many investments have been massively distorted by Fed intervention and that financial pain will ensue once the bubble pops.

Still, the notion of stocks being in a bubble is getting pushback from other Wall Street pros who say the typical ingredients of a bubble are absent.

Stock values, while elevated, are not at nosebleed levels, they say. Irrational exuberance is also missing.

“No, the market is not in a big bubble,” says Michael Farr, CEO of money management firm Farr Miller & Washington. “It's expensive, but it's not wildly speculative.”

The Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index’s current price-to-earnings ratio (P-E) — a common metric used to determine if the market is cheap or frothy — is far from bubble territory. The trailing four-quarter P-E on adjusted earnings is 18.7. While that's above the long-term average of 15 to 16 times earnings, it's well below the P-E of nearly 30 at the peak of the dot-com stock bubble in 2000.

What’s also missing is a stock-crazed nation where taxi drivers turn into day traders in hopes of making a fast buck in stocks.

“I don't get the sense that everyone is 'all in' like they were in real estate in 2007 and tech stocks in 2000,” says Paul Nolte, senior portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management. ""Many investors remain wary of stocks. When we read about everyone getting rich on the market and the many ‘can’t miss’ opportunities, then we’ll be in a bubble.”

Warren : Washington puts rich and powerful first and leaves working people behind
Minimum wage is n't enough to keep employed mom and baby out of poverty , she says
Warren : We strengthened the middle class before and can do it again by putting people first
A great crack in America 's middle class came to light recently : While our country continues to lead the world as the richest nation , our middle class , once the most affluent in the world , has fallen behind . According to an analysis by The New York Times , Canada 's middle class is now the wealthiest , and working families in many countries have seen their incomes rise much faster than those in the United States .
The hollowing out of America 's middle class has been years in the making , but it was n't inevitable that working families would fall further and further behind . Instead , it was the direct consequence of deliberate choices Washington has made over the past generation to put the rich and powerful first and to leave working people to pick up whatever crumbs were left behind .
It did n't have to be this way . America knows how to build a middle class that is the envy of the world . After the Great Depression , America made two critical decisions .
First , it put in place strong rules to level the playing field for families , putting more cops on the beat to monitor financial markets and passing basic safety rules to temper the boom-and-bust financial cycle .
Second , the country made building a future for our children the priority . We invested powerfully in our education system , and we made sure that people who worked full time would stay above the poverty line . We built infrastructure -- roads and bridges , our power grids -- so that we had the right foundation for businesses to build jobs here at home . We also invested in basic medical and scientific research , confident that if we built a great pipeline of ideas , our children would have opportunities their parents could only dream about .
These steps were aimed at building a strong middle class , and they worked . For a half a century , as the country got richer , our middle class got richer . America built a middle class that promised a bright future to each succeeding generation , a middle class that inched its way toward building opportunities , not just for some of our children , but for all our children .
JUST WATCHED Warren : I 'm not running for president Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Warren : I 'm not running for president 02:12
I lived this firsthand , growing up in a country that invested in its children . After my dad had a heart attack , my mom worked a minimum-wage job at Sears -- and that was enough to save our house . I went to a commuter college that cost $ 50 a semester , and my first husband worked on the moon shot . America was full of promise .
About 30 years ago , America began to move in a different direction . Washington took financial cops off the beat by slashing funding of our regulators , letting big banks load up on risk and target families with dangerous credit cards and mortgages . Washington also worked feverishly to cut taxes for those at the top , opening huge loopholes for big corporations and billionaires . Eventually , the loopholes got big enough to drive a truck through . According to the nonpartisan group Citizens for Tax Justice , by 2008-2012 , while the corporate tax rate on paper remained 35 % , 26 Fortune 500 companies paid $ 0 in taxes . That 's right -- zero .
And how did Washington propose to balance a budget with lower taxes ? Stop investing in the future . Instead of supporting college kids who are trying to get an education , the government now uses them as a source of revenue , making billions of dollars in profits off student loans .
Investments in roads and bridges have nearly ground to a halt . And government research -- the great pipeline of ideas that led to the creation of the Internet , nanotechnology , GPS and a million medical advances -- has had its legs cut out from under it .
Today , the director of the National Institutes of Health says there 's only enough money to fund one out of six National Institutes of Health research proposals , and our investments in scientific research do n't reflect the values of a nation that plans to lead the world in new discoveries .
The impact of these policies has echoed through the economy . Big banks , powerful corporations and billionaires -- people who can afford to hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers -- have amassed more and more wealth . Meanwhile , the foundations of our once strong middle class have begun to crumble , and families have been caught in a terrible squeeze .
Starting in the 1970s , even as workers became more productive , their wages flattened out , while the costs of housing , health care and sending a kid to college , just kept going up and up . In 1980 , the minimum wage was at least high enough to keep a working parent with a family of two out of poverty . Now , the minimum wage is n't even enough to keep a fully employed mother and a baby out of poverty -- and on Wednesday , Senate Republicans filibustered a bill to increase the federal minimum wage modestly .
We know how to strengthen the middle class in this country because we have done it before . We need a level playing field to make sure everyone follows the rules -- and that breaking the law has the same kinds of consequences for bank CEOs who launder drug money as for kids who get caught with a few ounces of pot .
We need to decide that our children -- not our biggest corporations -- are our first priority . We can take on the student loan problem that is crushing our kids , and to rebuild our roads and bridges , upgrade our power grids and expand our investments in basic research . And we can pay for that by putting an end to the tax loopholes and subsidies that go to powerful corporations and the wealthiest Americans .
We can repair the cracks in the middle class . We can strengthen our foundations and make sure that all of our children have a fighting chance . But it means changing who Washington works for -- and does n't .","Story highlights Elizabeth Warren: U.S. middle class, once richest in world, has fallen behind other nations

A great crack in America's middle class came to light recently: While our country continues to lead the world as the richest nation, our middle class, once the most affluent in the world, has fallen behind. According to an analysis by The New York Times, Canada's middle class is now the wealthiest, and working families in many countries have seen their incomes rise much faster than those in the United States.

The hollowing out of America's middle class has been years in the making, but it wasn't inevitable that working families would fall further and further behind. Instead, it was the direct consequence of deliberate choices Washington has made over the past generation to put the rich and powerful first and to leave working people to pick up whatever crumbs were left behind.

It didn't have to be this way. America knows how to build a middle class that is the envy of the world. After the Great Depression, America made two critical decisions.

Elizabeth Warren

First, it put in place strong rules to level the playing field for families, putting more cops on the beat to monitor financial markets and passing basic safety rules to temper the boom-and-bust financial cycle.

Second, the country made building a future for our children the priority. We invested powerfully in our education system, and we made sure that people who worked full time would stay above the poverty line. We built infrastructure -- roads and bridges, our power grids -- so that we had the right foundation for businesses to build jobs here at home. We also invested in basic medical and scientific research, confident that if we built a great pipeline of ideas, our children would have opportunities their parents could only dream about.

These steps were aimed at building a strong middle class, and they worked. For a half a century, as the country got richer, our middle class got richer. America built a middle class that promised a bright future to each succeeding generation, a middle class that inched its way toward building opportunities, not just for some of our children, but for all our children.

JUST WATCHED Warren: I'm not running for president Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Warren: I'm not running for president 02:12

I lived this firsthand, growing up in a country that invested in its children. After my dad had a heart attack, my mom worked a minimum-wage job at Sears -- and that was enough to save our house. I went to a commuter college that cost $50 a semester, and my first husband worked on the moon shot. America was full of promise.

About 30 years ago, America began to move in a different direction. Washington took financial cops off the beat by slashing funding of our regulators , letting big banks load up on risk and target families with dangerous credit cards and mortgages. Washington also worked feverishly to cut taxes for those at the top, opening huge loopholes for big corporations and billionaires. Eventually, the loopholes got big enough to drive a truck through. According to the nonpartisan group Citizens for Tax Justice, by 2008-2012, while the corporate tax rate on paper remained 35%, 26 Fortune 500 companies paid $0 in taxes . That's right -- zero.

And how did Washington propose to balance a budget with lower taxes? Stop investing in the future. Instead of supporting college kids who are trying to get an education, the government now uses them as a source of revenue, making billions of dollars in profits off student loans.

Investments in roads and bridges have nearly ground to a halt. And government research -- the great pipeline of ideas that led to the creation of the Internet, nanotechnology, GPS and a million medical advances -- has had its legs cut out from under it.

Today, the director of the National Institutes of Health says there's only enough money to fund one out of six National Institutes of Health research proposals, and our investments in scientific research don't reflect the values of a nation that plans to lead the world in new discoveries.

The impact of these policies has echoed through the economy. Big banks, powerful corporations and billionaires -- people who can afford to hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers -- have amassed more and more wealth. Meanwhile, the foundations of our once strong middle class have begun to crumble, and families have been caught in a terrible squeeze.

Starting in the 1970s, even as workers became more productive, their wages flattened out, while the costs of housing, health care and sending a kid to college, just kept going up and up. In 1980, the minimum wage was at least high enough to keep a working parent with a family of two out of poverty. Now, the minimum wage isn't even enough to keep a fully employed mother and a baby out of poverty -- and on Wednesday, Senate Republicans filibustered a bill to increase the federal minimum wage modestly.

We know how to strengthen the middle class in this country because we have done it before. We need a level playing field to make sure everyone follows the rules -- and that breaking the law has the same kinds of consequences for bank CEOs who launder drug money as for kids who get caught with a few ounces of pot.

We need to decide that our children -- not our biggest corporations -- are our first priority. We can take on the student loan problem that is crushing our kids, and to rebuild our roads and bridges, upgrade our power grids and expand our investments in basic research. And we can pay for that by putting an end to the tax loopholes and subsidies that go to powerful corporations and the wealthiest Americans.

We can repair the cracks in the middle class. We can strengthen our foundations and make sure that all of our children have a fighting chance. But it means changing who Washington works for -- and doesn't.",www.cnn.com,left,AhVvPymTy5iX3xR6
economic_policy,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/2018/10/16/17950672/improving-macroeconomic-stabilization,The Great Recession was awful. And we don’t have a plan to stop the next one.,2018-10-16,"Matthew Yglesias, Theodore Schleifer, Li Zhou, Sean Collins, Umair Irfan, Jen Kirby, Alex Abad-Santos","In his 2003 presidential address to the American Economics Association , Robert Lucas , a distinguished practitioner of the field and a Nobel laureate , proclaimed that “ macroeconomics was born as a distinct field in the 1940s , as part of the intellectual response to the Great Depression , ” and that he was able to say confidently “ that macroeconomics in this original sense has succeeded : Its central problem of depression prevention has been solved , for all practical purposes , and has in fact been solved for many decades . ”
Just four years later , in 2007 , the United States began to tip into recession . About a year after that , the recession triggered a financial crisis that led to a much more rapid collapse of demand — setting off a period that we don ’ t formally refer to as a “ depression ” but that certainly had most of the relevant characteristics of one . And that Great Recession became , though not strictly universal , certainly a global phenomenon , striking Britain , Japan , and the European Union , with spillover effects to South Africa , most of Latin America , and beyond .
And though 10 years later the American labor market has largely recovered , the same can not be said for Europe . What ’ s more , the output lost during the crisis is in a sense never coming back — trillions in human wealth are simply gone forever . The United States alone lost somewhere on the order of $ 5 trillion to $ 10 trillion worth of economic output , with much more damage accruing abroad .
Even worse , the world continues to struggle with the political consequences of the crisis . Around the world , progress toward freer trade and more economic integration has halted , anti-immigration parties are on the rise , and the prestige of liberal democracy has eroded around the world .
The field of policy that Lucas derided as a solved problem is known technically as “ macroeconomic stabilization. ” It ’ s mainly done by central banks like the US Federal Reserve , the European Central Bank , and the Bank of Japan , which routinely manipulate short-term interest rates . When pressed by the severity of the 2008 crisis , they tried more exotic methods like quantitative easing — basically bulk purchases of long-term government bonds — as well . But it goes beyond the central banks . National legislatures also play a role in fighting downturns by enacting ( or not ) fiscal stimulus programs .
There ’ s nothing inevitable about how things played out in 2008 . Australia hasn ’ t had a recession in 30 years , and in theory , equally skillful governments of bigger countries could produce the same result . The goal of macroeconomic stabilization is to make sure that recessions are rare , shallow , and short . And 15 years ago , policymakers were convinced that they had it all figured out .
The Great Recession made it clear that they had not . The uncontroversial tool of short-term interest rates wasn ’ t powerful enough , and the other options are the subject of both academic and political disagreement . Meanwhile , with the crisis in the rearview mirror , politicians have moved on to discussing other things . But though policymakers in Japan appear to have finally hit on a formula that works to stimulate a deeply depressed economy — a mixture of large budget deficits , direct central bank setting of long-term as well as short-term interest rates , and even printing money to buy shares of stock — these ideas remain controversial , untested , and in some cases illegal in the West .
Depressions , however , are extraordinarily damaging . And though the most recent global downturn largely spared the world ’ s poorest people , that was much more a matter of good luck than policy design . Crafting a science and technology of macroeconomic stabilization that can reliably prevent depressions could alleviate the suffering of millions , while simultaneously minimizing the odds of political catastrophes unleashed by economic mismanagement .
The Congressional Budget Office routinely publishes estimates of the “ potential output ” of the United States — how much goods and services could be produced if the available stock of human labor and capital goods were fully utilized , as they would be in a system of perfect macroeconomic stabilization . If actual output exceeds potential output by too much , inflation will result . When it falls short , we have elevated unemployment and sluggish wage growth .
A chart that simply subtracts actual GDP from potential GDP reveals the striking fact that since the dot-com crash of 2000 , America has had below-potential output every single year of the 21st century .
This has given us , in the aggregate , $ 5.5 trillion less of total goods and services than we would have had in a properly stabilized economy .
But even that is a significant underestimate of the aggregate cost of poor macroeconomic management to the country . That ’ s because potential output is in part a function of past actual output . When the stock of capital goods — that ’ s buildings , machines , and business equipment — is fully employed , then there are strong incentives to invest in making new capital goods that raise potential output in the future . Similarly , when people are working rather than unemployed , they are building on-the-job skills that make them more valuable workers in the future .
In 2017 and 2018 , we are only falling slightly below our economy ’ s ability to produce things . But that closing of the gap largely reflects a steady shrinking of our expected capacity — in other words , we ’ re likely underestimating just how much economic damage we ’ ve suffered because our forecasts for expected output have fallen steadily over time .
This means the real cost of poor macroeconomic management in the 21st century could easily be twice as high as my numbers . But worse , if you take the implications of falling potential output fully seriously , the implication is that we will forever be at least somewhat poorer than we otherwise could have been . And of course , those are only the costs to the United States of America . The impact in the eurozone — whose total output is somewhat larger than America ’ s — has been , if anything , more severe .
And in some respects , the next recession could be even worse .
Though the Great Recession ravaged hundreds of millions of people around the world , it didn ’ t impede global progress toward reductions in steep absolute poverty . This was good news , but it led , in some ways , to an unfortunate tendency in humanitarian circles to characterize the economic calamity as a kind of distraction from the real good news about the global economy . The truth is that the global poor got lucky and , unless the world ’ s understanding of macroeconomic stabilization improves , they may not be so lucky next time .
The two most important pieces of good luck are that China and India entered the recession with the ability to fight the downturn via massive fiscal stimulus ( in China ’ s case ) and conventional interest rate cuts ( for India ) , which not only had a large direct impact on poverty but also managed to sustain growth in most of sub-Saharan Africa , which was exporting a lot to China .
But not all developing countries were so lucky . Places like South Africa and much of Latin America and the Caribbean were more economically linked to the US and Europe than to China and suffered massively . And Africa ’ s strong performance despite a global recession was exceptional by historical standards . Prior to the 2008- ’ 09 business cycle , relatively mild recessions in the rich world ( the recessions so mild that they prompted Lucas to proclaim the whole problem irrelevant ) had more severe impacts on Africa ’ s commodity-oriented economies than they did on the countries that originally set them off .
Of course , if China and India somehow never have a recession again , then perhaps global poverty can continue falling indefinitely no matter how poorly the US and European economies are managed . But the risk is that as China and India continue to converge economically with the developed world , they will increasingly face the exact same policy challenges as the developed world — meaning the question of effective macroeconomic stabilization should be seen as a fundamentally global problem .
Deep recessions , meanwhile , also have the unfortunate consequence of pushing rich countries ’ economic policy in directions that are harmful to the world ’ s most vulnerable people .
The core problem of the knock-on political consequences of bad macroeconomic policy is that during a recession , the objective facts of economic policy change . When the labor market is healthy , then policies that boost productivity and growth make the vast majority of people better off even if they do displace some workers . People who lose jobs just find new ones .
When the labor market is unhealthy , people tend to feel differently about politics and policy . But those feelings are rooted in objective reality . It ’ s genuinely true that technological advancement , openness to trade , immigration , and other growth-promoting policies can be damaging to many people .
Consider trade . Paul Krugman spent much of the downturn years arguing that restricting trade with China would help boost the American economy , given the high unemployment rate . Gauti Eggertsson of Brown University and the New York Fed has a fairly convincing paper arguing that during the New Deal , policies to form cartels and reduce agricultural output actually improved economic growth because higher prices broke the cycle of deflation . Similarly , but going in the other direction , low unemployment and labor scarcity create a strong constituency for openness to immigrant workers who become objectively necessary for growth when there ’ s no reserve army of domestic unemployed .
Japan , for example , is becoming increasingly welcoming toward immigrants even as the rest of the world is moving in the opposite direction precisely because Japan has gotten ahead of other rich countries in its macroeconomic management . Japan ’ s labor force participation rate is at an all-time high , which is great news for Japanese people but also makes more immigration objectively desirable , which is in turn creating enormous new opportunities for residents of poorer countries . If every rich country could get as good at recession-fighting as Japan , the entire global political climate would be much more benign .
The core problem of the Great Recession , looking back , is precisely that Lucas ’ s complacent forecast really did seem sensible at the time . It appeared for a span of decades that central banks had learned how to successfully manipulate short-term interest rates in a predictable and reliable way that , while not avoiding recessions altogether , made them relatively short and painless .
That era came to a crashing halt in 2007- ’ 08 . Interest rates were already low by the time the downturn struck , so further cuts in short-term rates — the Fed ’ s traditional main tool — was not much help . The Federal Reserve cut them all the way down to zero , but that wasn ’ t low enough . And neither the Fed nor other major central banks had a clear game plan for what to do once you get to zero .
When we needed a robust response to the Great Recession , we were ill-equipped both as a matter of politics and policy . Congress tried fiscal stimulus and the Fed tried several rounds of quantitative easing , and the best evidence suggests that they both helped . But neither was enacted on a scale sufficient to actually cure the problem , and both were the subject of massive political backlash .
At the moment , Fed policymakers and professional staff have a somewhat clearer view of the technical issues than they did pre-recession , but they still have no specific game plan for what to do next time , and there ’ s zero political consensus about what they should do .
Over the past decades , a range of countries have experimented with some different approaches that seem to work — massive quantitative easing in Japan , exchange rate manipulation in Switzerland , credit policy in China — but none of them are clearly understood or universally accepted . Most importantly , the biggest and most influential central banks in the world — the Fed and the European Central Bank — haven ’ t clearly embraced any of these solutions as its game plan for the next time around . Nor have the American or European political systems reached any kind of consensus on the use of discretionary fiscal policy as an alternative to relying on central banks .
An underrated option that probably deserves more consideration is to dispense with a lot of the complexity and simply have the central bank print money and give directly to citizens as a kind of combined fiscal/monetary stimulus . There is , however , a wide variety of possible solutions , and it ’ s not particularly important which one is picked as long as something is picked .
But instead , everyone is left standing around essentially hoping that the problems that afflicted us a decade ago won ’ t arise again , even though almost nothing has been done to try to prevent their recurrence . Whether or not that changes in time is one of the biggest issues facing the future of humanity and deserves to be taken more seriously .","In his 2003 presidential address to the American Economics Association, Robert Lucas, a distinguished practitioner of the field and a Nobel laureate, proclaimed that “macroeconomics was born as a distinct field in the 1940s, as part of the intellectual response to the Great Depression,” and that he was able to say confidently “that macroeconomics in this original sense has succeeded: Its central problem of depression prevention has been solved, for all practical purposes, and has in fact been solved for many decades.”

This was, of course, untrue.

The cost of recessions is enormous

If actual output exceeds potential output by too much, inflation will result. When it falls short, we have elevated unemployment and sluggish wage growth.

At the moment, Fed policymakers and professional staff have a somewhat clearer view of the technical issues than they did pre-recession, but they still have no specific game plan for what to do next time, and there’s zero political consensus about what they should do.

Over the past decades, a range of countries have experimented with some different approaches that seem to work — massive quantitative easing in Japan, exchange rate manipulation in Switzerland, credit policy in China — but none of them are clearly understood or universally accepted. Most importantly, the biggest and most influential central banks in the world — the Fed and the European Central Bank — haven’t clearly embraced any of these solutions as its game plan for the next time around. Nor have the American or European political systems reached any kind of consensus on the use of discretionary fiscal policy as an alternative to relying on central banks.

An underrated option that probably deserves more consideration is to dispense with a lot of the complexity and simply have the central bank print money and give directly to citizens as a kind of combined fiscal/monetary stimulus. There is, however, a wide variety of possible solutions, and it’s not particularly important which one is picked as long as something is picked.

But instead, everyone is left standing around essentially hoping that the problems that afflicted us a decade ago won’t arise again, even though almost nothing has been done to try to prevent their recurrence. Whether or not that changes in time is one of the biggest issues facing the future of humanity and deserves to be taken more seriously.",www.vox.com,left,bK9novtcpdZ4zdbQ

Americanism, not globalism

But Trump also threw in some red meat for workers attracted to his “America first” philosophy. “Americanism, not globalism, will be our new credo,” he said.

“This was a reset and contrast speech,” says Republican strategist Ford O’Connell. “Overall, it was one of his best policy speeches, because he was able to blend conservative economic theory with a mix of Trump populism.

Key elements of Trump’s speech include:

Adoption of the House Republican proposal for individual income tax rates. This would lower the top federal rate (currently 39.6 percent) and reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three – 33 percent, 25 percent, and 12 percent.

Reducing the business tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent.

Eliminating the estate tax.

Allowing parents to fully deduct the average cost of child-care spending from their taxes.

Tariffs against any countries that “cheat by unfairly subsidizing their goods.”

Trump’s tax plan would raise more revenue than his earlier proposal, which had been forecast to cost $10 trillion over a decade.

“They bumped up the income rate a little bit, but they’re still going to lose trillions of dollars,” said Jared Bernstein, an economist with the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and a former member of President Obama’s economic team.

Looking backward?

Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of American Action Forum and the chief economic adviser to GOP presidential nominee John McCain in 2008, calls Trump’s tax plan “a peace offering to House Republicans” but also cites outreach to labor by adopting Democratic positions on trade and infrastructure.

“We will build the next generation of roads, bridges, railways, tunnels, seaports, and airports,” Trump said, a reference to an infrastructure plan that his campaign says would be double what Mrs. Clinton is proposing.

But Trump’s trade protectionism is out of step with economic realities, even in Detroit, because the economy isn’t just manufacturing. The economy of Detroit, and Michigan as a whole, is steadily improving, he says.

But Andrew Yang , the plucky venture capitalist , made the case that his policies really are for everyone .
`` I 'm building a coalition of disaffected Trump voters , independents , libertarians , and conservatives , as well as Democrats and progressives , '' Yang explained . He believes he can unite all these folks with a Universal Basic Income ( UBI ) , which Yang says is `` a deeply American idea '' that connects `` Thomas Paine to Martin Luther King to today . '' Yang 's version of the UBI would see every American citizen 18 and older receive $ 1,000 a month—no exceptions .
But does his plan actually resonate across centuries and ideologies ? The short answer is no . While a simple form of UBI has indeed been tossed around for many years , its implementation and cost look very different depending on whose version you read .
Do we start with St. Thomas More , who , in 1516 , said that `` provid [ ing ] everyone with some means of livelihood '' would cut down on crime ? Or do we take a cue from Yang and commence with Thomas Paine 's late 18th century musings on the subject ?
As ███ 's Jesse Walker points out , better to begin with the latter , whose 1797 pamphlet Agrarian Justice advocated for a policy most closely related to today 's UBI talk . Paine wrote that `` the earth , in its natural , uncultivated state was…the common property of the human race . '' Although cultivation of that land was `` one of the greatest natural improvements ever made , '' it also displaced people , robbing them of `` their natural inheritance '' and creating `` a species of poverty and wretchedness that did not exist before . '' To rectify that disinheritance , Paine argued everyone was owed a yearly sum : 15 pounds for those between the ages of 21 and 49 , and 10 pounds for those aged 50 and older .
Yang 's UBI is essentially a modern-day , technologized version of Paine 's proposal . Instead of agricultural practices dispossessing American citizens , Yang blames big tech companies , which he says are automating jobs into oblivion . You do n't have to be a member of the Yang Gang to see other similarities between the two proposals . Paine called his payout the `` Citizens Dividend , '' while Yang nicknamed his stipend the `` Freedom Dividend . ''
But would they cost the same ? Decidedly not . Adjusted for inflation , 15 pounds of sterling in 1797 comes out to about $ 1,960 in today 's dollars—a far cry from Yang 's proposed $ 12,000 redistribution .
How about Martin Luther King , Jr. , the well-known civil rights activist and little-known UBI supporter ? King placed the plight of the poor at the center of his platform . But his vision for a basic income was perhaps more conditional than universal . He wrote in his last book , Where Do We Go From Here : Chaos or Community ? :
We must create full employment or we must create incomes . People must be made consumers by one method or the other . Once they are placed in this position , we need to be concerned that the potential of the individual is not wasted . New forms of work that enhance the social good will have to be devised for those for whom traditional jobs are not available .
A government-sponsored jobs program was central to King 's proposal , and thus better reflected in Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez 's ( D–N.Y . ) Green New Deal than in Yang 's no-strings-attached UBI .
Then there 's the libertarian cohort of UBI fan boys , spearheaded by Milton Friedman and Charles Murray . The crowd at Yang 's Washington , D.C. , rally on April 15 burst into applause at the mention of Friedman . But the famous free-market economist 's idea of UBI does n't square up with Yang 's . Friedman advocated for a negative income tax , which replaces levies on low-income individuals with supplemental funds from the government . Friedman 's plan consequently ensures that everyone in society receives a guaranteed minimum income , but it does n't redistribute money to people who do n't need it .
And then there 's Murray , the conservatarian economist who actually does favor a UBI that resembles Yang 's . He shares the candidate 's worries about automating the American job out of existence and has proposed giving everyone in America aged 21 and older $ 13,000—even more than Yang ! However , it 's worth noting that Murray would require $ 3,000 of that payout go toward health insurance . The two thinkers also differ on one other point , and it 's a doozy : Murray 's UBI would replace the entire welfare system , whereas Yang 's would exist alongside a welfare system .
`` You do n't want to take away benefits that hundreds of thousands of Americans are literally relying upon for their very survival , '' Yang told me back in April . `` The goal is to create more positive incentives . ''
So how would the presidential hopeful finance his `` tech check '' ? For starters , Yang says that , while the welfare state would remain intact , spending would fall by $ 500 to $ 600 billion . He would also implement a 10 percent Value Added Tax ( VAT ) , which he says would raise $ 800 billion in new revenue . He further forecasts the U.S. would save between $ 100 to $ 200 billion `` as people would take better care of themselves , '' saving funds from visits to the emergency room and jail cells . The economy would grow by $ 800-900 billion , he posits , with consumers more empowered to spend as they please . A tax on top earners and carbon would also add to the freedom fund , although by how much he does n't say .
But apart from his VAT tax , Yang 's financial justification is chock full of uncertainty , as it relies heavily on the notion that the economy will expand by almost a trillion dollars—a big if , to say the least . Consider for a moment if all went to plan : On paper , his UBI costs about $ 2.8 trillion , but , even in a perfect world , his current concrete projections fall $ 600 billion short of that . It 's unlikely that a tax on the wealthy and carbon would raise those funds , and there 's always the chance that capital creators would choose to move their businesses and the money they create to safe havens .
Yang has stuck to his guns despite these questions . He said in April that his UBI would put `` more people in a position where they can actually participate in a free market , '' fostering a `` much more dynamic economy . '' When we spoke , he had just removed a hat that spelled `` MATH '' in bold , capital letters , which the presidential hopeful wore as a badge of honor during his rally . It 's become somewhat of a one-word campaign slogan , gracing signs and swag alike .
