Elizabeth Warren ( D-MA ) introduced last spring that would make doing taxes vastly easier for Americans — and would strongly push back against the tax prep industry 's attempts to keep taxes difficult .
The Tax Filing Simplification Act of 2017 would order the IRS to create a free online tax preparation and filing service comparable to TurboTax or other commercial programs . Moreover , it bans the agency from working with the tax prep companies , as it 's been doing for years .
Currently , the IRS collaborates with tax software providers ( mainly Intuit , which sells TurboTax ) on what 's called the Free File program . The program is supposed to provide free access to commercial software for low- and medium-income taxpayers . But because the eligibility rules are so complicated and the system is so poorly advertised , only 3 percent of taxpayers use it , and the National Taxpayer Advocate has repeatedly called for the program 's abolition .
Warren 's bill would kill the corrupt , feckless Free File program for good . But it goes further than that . Best of all , it establishes a new `` return-free '' filing option that would send millions of Americans with simple tax situations a pre-prepared tax return , which they can submit unchanged if they like . Warren is n't the first person to propose this . Sen. Jeanne Shaheen ( D-NH ) and Rep. Bill Foster ( D-IL ) both have similar bills this Congress .
But it 's a great idea that a number of other countries have already adopted , which would put billions more in the hands of the working poor and make tax filing a cinch for millions of families . And it already has a huge amount of Democratic support , with Sens . Shaheen , Bernie Sanders ( I-VT ) , Sheldon Whitehouse ( D-RI ) , Tom Udall ( D-NM ) , Tammy Baldwin ( D-WI ) , Ed Markey ( D-MA ) , Pat Leahy ( D-VT ) , Tammy Duckworth ( D-IL ) , Maggie Hassan ( D-NH ) , and Jeff Merkley ( D-OR ) all on board .
The actual work of doing your taxes mostly involves rifling through various IRS forms you get in the mail . There are W-2s listing your wages , 1099s showing miscellaneous income like from one-off gigs , etc . To fill out your 1040 , you gather all these together and copy the numbers in them onto the 1040 form . The main advantage of TurboTax is that it can import these forms automatically and spare you this step .
But here 's the thing about the forms : The IRS gets them too . When ███ Media sent me a W-2 telling me how much it paid me in 2017 , it also sent an identical one to the IRS . When my bank sent me a 1099 telling me how much interest I earned on my savings account in 2017 , it also sent one to the IRS . If I 'm not itemizing deductions ( like 70 percent of taxpayers ) , the IRS has all the information it needs to calculate my taxes , send me a filled-out return , and let me either send it in or do my taxes by hand if I prefer .
This is n't a purely hypothetical proposal . Countries like Denmark , Sweden , Estonia , Chile , and Spain already offer `` pre-populated returns '' to their citizens .
In a number of countries , like Japan and the UK , the vast majority of people don ’ t have to file tax returns at all , pre-populated or otherwise . Instead , through a system known as “ precision withholding , ” the government takes exactly the right amount out of every paycheck . If they find that a mistake was made — not accounting for a charitable donation or mortgage interest , for example — they find that mistake in charity and bank records , and they fix it for you . In journalist T.R . Reid ’ s great book A Fine Mess , he explains how the Japanese system works :
Japan ’ s equivalent of the IRS , Kokuzeicho , gathers all the pertinent data for each worker — income , taxable benefits , number of personal exemptions , tax withheld , and so on — and then computes how much the worker owes in tax , down to the last yen . Because Japan uses a system known as “ precision withholding , ” with the amount changing whenever pay goes up or down , most people withhold the exact amount due . In early March , Kokuzeicho sends a postcard to every citizen that sets forth all this information : how much you earned , how much tax you owe , how much tax you ’ ve already paid through withholding . If you ’ ve paid in more tax than you owe , Kokuzeicho deposits the refund amount in your bank account ; if you did not withhold enough , the agency takes the tax that ’ s due from your bank account . … As a result , paying income tax is a totally automatic process for about 80 percent of Japanese households , requiring no more work than reading a postcard once a year .
Closer to home , California has a voluntary return-free filing program called ReadyReturn for its income taxes .
And there are serious plans , like Warren 's , for adopting this idea nationwide . Austan Goolsbee , former chief economist for the Obama administration , designed a proposal called `` The Simple Return '' in 2006 that would provide pre-populated returns for everyone not itemizing their deductions . You could even conceivably extend it to many itemizers ; mortgage lenders already send out 1098 tax forms listing interest paid over the year , and the IRS could mandate that charities do the same for tax-exempt contributions .
The Obama administration supports return-free filing , and Ronald Reagan touted the idea in a 1985 speech :
We envision a system where more than half of us would not even have to fill out a return . We call it the return-free system , and it would be totally voluntary . If you decided to participate , you would automatically receive your refund or a letter explaining any additional tax you owe . Should you disagree with this figure , you would be free to fill out your taxes using the regular form . We believe most Americans would go from the long form or the short form to no form .
The proposal would be particularly good for low-income Americans eligible for the earned income and child tax credits , which are both refundable and offer substantial benefits to low-income taxpayers who file . But because you have to file , compliance is n't perfect . Twenty percent of people eligible for the EITC do n't get it , and a big fraction of returns contain errors , usually because of the complexity of the credit and due to errors by commercial tax preparers .
Automatic filing would provide EITC payments to many of that 20 percent not getting them , and would spare taxpayers from doing complex calculations that sometimes lead to errors .
The unholy alliance of Big Tax Prep and anti-tax conservatives
So why has n't return-free filing happened yet ? The short answer is lobbying , and in particular lobbying by companies like Intuit . In 2013 , ProPublica 's Liz Day wrote an incredible exposé on just how hard Intuit has lobbied to stop return-free filing from becoming a reality :
[ In 2007 ] a bill to limit return-free filing was introduced by a pair of unlikely allies : Reps. Eric Cantor , R-Va. , the conservative House majority leader , and Zoe Lofgren , D-Calif. , a liberal stalwart whose district includes Silicon Valley . Intuit 's political committee and employees have contributed to both . Cantor and his leadership PAC have received $ 26,100 in the past five years from the company 's PAC and employees . In the last two years , the Intuit PAC and employees donated $ 26,000 to Lofgren . …In 2005 , California launched a pilot program called ReadyReturn . As it fought against the program over the next five years , Intuit spent more than $ 3 million on overall lobbying and political campaigns in the state , according to Dennis J. Ventry Jr. , a professor at UC Davis School of Law who specializes in tax policy and legal ethics .
They have n't stopped ; in 2014 , Day reported that Intuit was involved with an astroturfing effort meant to manufacture the appearance of grassroots opposition to automatic filing . Intuit spent $ 13 million lobbying Congress from 2011 to 2015 , with 41 lobbying reports relating to taxes in 2015 alone . Most of the reports reference lobbying to `` enhance voluntary compliance '' — a euphemism for opposing automatic filing .
In this , Intuit and other tax prep companies had a powerful ally : Grover Norquist . The anti-tax crusader vehemently opposes automatic filing on the grounds that it makes tax season insufficiently nightmarish , which might reduce people 's aversion to taxes and make it easier for politicians to pass tax increases . So even though Ronald Reagan himself supported automatic filing , Norquist has helped make the idea dirt in the eyes of conservative legislators .
What you can do to fight the tax preparation industry
Warren 's bill would start the US on the path to return-free filing . It 's a great piece of legislation , and Congress would do well to pass it .
But in the meantime , what 's a regular person hoping for return-free filing to do ? Well , you could do what Joseph Bankman , the Stanford Law professor who helped design California 's system , did and spend $ 30,000 out of pocket to hire a lobbyist to push the idea and counter Intuit 's lobbying .
But for those of us without $ 30,000 to spare for the greater good , there 's a less demanding option : Stop paying for TurboTax .
Now , if you have a relatively simple return without itemizations , I 'm not going to argue that you should n't use TurboTax for free . It , like most tax software , includes a free option for simple returns or for households making under $ 62,000 a year . Using that is totally fine , as is using Free File Fillable Forms , a program offered by the tax prep companies in conjunction with the IRS that has a computerized version of the basic 1040 form . As long as you 're not giving any of your money to a tax preparation company , it 's all good .
But resist the urge to pay for anything . Do n't pay for the state version . Do n't pay for one allowing for itemized deductions . Do n't pay for anything . Hell , do n't pay for Intuit 's other products like QuickBooks either if you can help it . Paying means putting money into Intuit 's pocket , which it can then turn around and use to lobby to make your taxes more complicated .
A boycott might seem a bit paradoxical : If the case for automatic filing is that it 's easier than doing your own taxes , is n't TurboTax also easier than doing your own taxes ? And , sure , it is . But it costs money , and you should get that convenience for free . In the meantime , doing your own taxes is a hassle , but not so huge of a hassle to not be worth it as a way to punish Intuit and push for a better system .
Moreover , that better system will help people who are n't even filing taxes now , by making more of them aware of refundable credits . Even if a boycott is n't in your own immediate self-interest , it 's worth doing to help them .
After years of using the paid version of TurboTax , I did my own taxes using Free File Fillable Forms for the first time last month . Yes , it was a bit annoying . But even though I itemize my deductions it only took a couple of hours , not much longer than TurboTax would . It 's absolutely worth it .
If you have yet to file , do n't pay TurboTax a cent . If enough of us get on board , we might finally get to enjoy the return-free world we deserve .

The tax fight isn't over.

After Congress passed and President Obama signed a bill to allow automatic tax hikes on high incomes, Democrats and Republicans are fighting about taxes yet again.

In separate interviews over the weekend, Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid both said they will push for more revenue increases as part of another deal to avoid the looming ""sequester"" - automatic budget cuts that will take effect March 1, barring agreement on other deficit-reduction measures.

Both suggested closing tax ""loopholes"" as a way to raise more cash for the government.

""There's no doubt we need additional revenue, coupled with smart spending reductions in order to bring down our deficit,"" Obama said in an interview with CBS's Scott Pelley. ""Can we close loopholes and deductions that folks who are well connected, and have a lot of accountants and lawyers, can take advantage of, so they end up paying lower rates than say, a bus driver or a cop?""

Reid told ABC's George Stephanopoulos that ""without any question,"" more revenue needs to be part of a follow-up deal.

""The American people are on our side,"" he said. ""The American people don't believe in these austere things. We believe that the rich should contribute. We believe we should fill those tax loopholes - get rid of them, I should say. And that's where we need to go.""

Republicans, needless to say, do not agree.

When the Senate reopened for business on Tuesday, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell devoted most of his speech to bashing the idea of new taxes instead of spending.

""If you were to listen to the Democrats, you would think that all our problems would be solved by raising taxes on private jets or energy companies,"" McConnell said, arguing that tax hikes - even the so-called ""loopholes"" Democrats want to target - will drive jobs overseas. ""They don't want the facts to get in the way of a good political talking point.""

""That issue is closed,"" Michael Steel, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, told ABC News. ""President Obama got the tax hikes he wanted last month. Washington has a spending problem, and that's what President Obama and Senate Democrats need to address.""

It's not that Republicans are totally opposed to closing tax ""loopholes."" The conservative Club for Growth, which backs Republican primary candidates who support anti-tax policies, says it supports what Obama and Reid are pushing - but only as part of a broader deal on tax reform.

‘PASS-THROUGH’ RATE

The plan would set a new 25 percent tax rate for “pass-through” businesses, which are usually small, private enterprises, such as partnerships and sole proprietorships. They represent about 95 percent of all U.S. businesses.

Under current law, the profits of those companies “pass through” directly to their owners and are taxed as personal income, often at the top 39.6 percent individual income rate.

taxes,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/2019/2/20/18231742/amazon-corporate-income-tax,"Amazon’s $0 corporate income tax bill last year, explained",2019-02-20,"Matthew Yglesias, German Lopez, Brian Resnick, Aaron Rupar, Jen Kirby","Amazon ’ s founder is America ’ s richest person , but the company paid no corporate income tax last year . How can that be ?
For starters , Jeff Bezos is rich because of the value of Amazon stock , but for years , Wall Street loved the company even though it was a curiously unprofitable retail and technology giant . But more recently , Amazon has emerged recently as a consistently profitable firm , reporting nearly $ 11 billion in earnings last year . Yet during this surge into profitability — the company ’ s earnings doubled between 2017 and 2018 — Amazon ’ s tax bill has actually gone down . The company paid $ 0 in corporate income tax last year , according to an analysis from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy , an astonishing figure that generated dozens of news stories last week .
A big part of the story here is the tax treatment of stock-based compensation ( which Amazon offers to most of its employees ) , which has the slightly odd feature that the more successful your company becomes , the lower your tax bill becomes .
Amazon , in other words , didn ’ t manage to avoid paying any corporate income tax in 2018 despite the huge surge in profits but largely because of it . If this seems like a policy failure , though , the real problem is probably not Amazon ’ s light tax bill but the extent to which a policy initiative from the early 1990s that was meant to constrain CEO pay has totally backfired .
An interesting thing to note here is that Amazon isn ’ t lowering its tax bill through classic technology company shenanigans like stashing profits in offshore subsidiaries or declaring itself to be a foreign company . Amazon ’ s sales are mostly in the United States , and its No . 2 market is Germany , which is also a relatively high tax jurisdiction .
Amazon isn ’ t cheating anyone here ; it just legitimately owes no taxes .
Some of that is because Amazon is able to avail itself of the research and development tax credit , a not-very-controversial policy that encourages profitable companies to plow earnings into R & D . Congress routinely extends this on a bipartisan basis , with the thinking that research into innovation is good , and Amazon is obviously a company that does a fair amount of R & D .
The second reason is that the Trump tax bill included a temporary provision allowing companies to take a 100 percent tax deduction for investment in equipment . This is a controversial idea , but it has some support across party lines — Obama White House economist Jason Furman likes it , for example .

How can that be?

For starters, Jeff Bezos is rich because of the value of Amazon stock, but for years, Wall Street loved the company even though it was a curiously unprofitable retail and technology giant. But more recently, Amazon has emerged recently as a consistently profitable firm, reporting nearly $11 billion in earnings last year. Yet during this surge into profitability — the company’s earnings doubled between 2017 and 2018 — Amazon’s tax bill has actually gone down. The company paid $0 in corporate income tax last year, according to an analysis from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, an astonishing figure that generated dozens of news stories last week.

A big part of the story here is the tax treatment of stock-based compensation (which Amazon offers to most of its employees), which has the slightly odd feature that the more successful your company becomes, the lower your tax bill becomes.

Amazon, in other words, didn’t manage to avoid paying any corporate income tax in 2018 despite the huge surge in profits but largely because of it. If this seems like a policy failure, though, the real problem is probably not Amazon’s light tax bill but the extent to which a policy initiative from the early 1990s that was meant to constrain CEO pay has totally backfired.

Amazon’s three tricks for reducing its taxes

An interesting thing to note here is that Amazon isn’t lowering its tax bill through classic technology company shenanigans like stashing profits in offshore subsidiaries or declaring itself to be a foreign company. Amazon’s sales are mostly in the United States, and its No. 2 market is Germany, which is also a relatively high tax jurisdiction.

Amazon isn’t cheating anyone here; it just legitimately owes no taxes.

Some of that is because Amazon is able to avail itself of the research and development tax credit, a not-very-controversial policy that encourages profitable companies to plow earnings into R&D. Congress routinely extends this on a bipartisan basis, with the thinking that research into innovation is good, and Amazon is obviously a company that does a fair amount of R&D.

The second reason is that the Trump tax bill included a temporary provision allowing companies to take a 100 percent tax deduction for investment in equipment. This is a controversial idea, but it has some support across party lines — Obama White House economist Jason Furman likes it, for example. More broadly, when Democrats complain that companies are plowing too much of their profits into share buybacks rather than investing, they are in effect saying they wished more companies acted like Amazon — which does not do any share buybacks and does invest a lot — and this provision of the Trump tax bill encourages companies to do this.

Last and most significant to understanding the change in 2018 is the fact that companies can deduct the cost of stock-based compensation from their taxable earnings even though it doesn’t actually cost companies any money to hand out shares of their own stock to employees. What’s more, the way this cost is estimated is that the more your share price rises, the bigger the deduction for handing out shares. So precisely because Amazon’s profits surged, the price of the company’s shares went up a lot and the value of these deductions surged as well.

That may sound a little unconventional — in general, the idea is that more successful firms should pay higher taxes, not lower — but there’s a pretty good accounting reason for it. At the same time, the entire tendency of companies to offer executives stock-based compensation packages is essentially a giant loophole in a decades-old tax provision that was supposed to deter lavish executive compensation.

Stock-based compensation, explained

Way back in 1993, Bill Clinton and congressional Democrats had an idea to tackle the growing pay inequality of Reagan-era America — Section 162(m) of the US Tax Code.

Normally, while companies pay sales taxes to state and local governments, the federal government taxes them on their profits. Revenue that is paid out to employees as salaries and benefits is not profits, and thus doesn’t get taxed. But section 162(m) created an exception to that rule — any salary of over $1 million paid to top executives would not be deductible for tax purposes. The idea was to deter lavish executive compensation packages. Except there was an exception to the exception — compensation that took the form of stock options or stock grants would still be deductible. So in a practical sense, what the 1993 change did was incentivize companies to use a lot of stock-based compensation for their executives.

But here’s a critical thing.

While a company of course could provide stock-based compensation by taking money out of the bank, using it to buy shares on the open market (this would be one of the dreaded share buybacks) and then giving those shares to executives, in practice, that’s not how it works. Amazon, or any other company, can just issue more shares of Amazon stock anytime it wants to. This costs Amazon shareholders in the sense that creating new shares tends to devalue the existing ones, but it doesn’t involve any direct financial cost to the company per se.

Here’s what’s even weirder. When a company’s share price goes up a lot, the value of stock-based compensation rises as well. That’s by design. Part of the goal of stock-based compensation is to make sure you are paying executives for performance — or at least guaranteeing that rank-and-file workers will share in the prosperity of the company’s shareholders. But this means that in accounting terms, when a company’s share price goes up a lot — as it might if, say, it successfully doubled profits — the value of the tax deduction for the stock-based compensation also goes up a lot.

Anyone looking for a glimmer of bipartisanship in Washington might want to pay attention to the medical device tax that is part of Obamacare. It took a notable, if largely symbolic, hit this week from the left and the right.

The 2.3-percent excise tax on devices ranging from MRI machines to pacemakers to stethoscopes was meant to raise $20 billion over 10 years to help pay for extending health care coverage to the uninsured under the Affordable Care Act.

Klobuchar's news release on the lopsided vote actually contained a quote from Hatch as well as her Minnesota colleague and fellow Democrat, Sen. Al Franken. Those are names you don't usually see in the same news release.

The vote was mainly symbolic, since it came on a nonbinding resolution. The hope, according to a Democratic Senate aide, is that the bipartisan supermajority vote will speed the inclusion of a repeal in tax reform or deficit reduction legislation that might be taken up later this year.

The hope is to marry this revenue with more select spending cuts, chiefly at the expense of farm subsidies and defense.

A top Senate Democrat warned Monday that , if Republicans do n't relent , her caucus is willing to let all the Bush-era tax rates expire at the end of the year -- in effect threatening to let the country fall off what many in Washington call the `` fiscal cliff . ''
That cliff is approaching at the start of 2013 , when the Bush tax cuts are set to expire and billions of dollars in automatic spending cuts -- spawned by last summer 's debt-ceiling debate -- are set to take effect . Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are hoping to shift around those spending cuts to spare key areas like defense , and to temporarily extend the Bush tax rates for at least some Americans . Some have warned a failure to do so could send the nation back into recession .
But Sen. Patty Murray , D-Wash. , indicated Democrats are willing to let the deadline pass in order to better their negotiating position .
`` So if we ca n't get a good deal , a balanced deal that calls on the wealthy to pay their fair share , then I will absolutely continue this debate into 2013 rather than lock in a long-term deal this year that throws middle-class families under the bus , '' she said in an address Monday afternoon at the Brookings Institution . Murray is head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee , the campaign arm for Senate Democrats .
In the remarks , Murray explained that if all the tax cuts expire , then that will diminish the GOP argument that the Democratic plan is tantamount to a tax hike -- because come 2013 , any change to the tax code would be a tax cut .
`` We will have a new fiscal and political reality , '' Murray said . `` If the Bush tax cuts expire , every proposal will be a tax cut proposal and the pledge ( to not raise taxes ) will no longer keep Republicans boxed in and unable to compromise .
`` If middle-class families start seeing more money coming out of their paychecks next year -- are Republicans really going to stand up and fight for new tax cuts for the rich ? Are they going to continue opposing the Democrats ' middle-class tax cut once the slate has been wiped clean ? I think they know that that would be an untenable political position . And I hope this pushes them to come to the table with real revenue now before being forced to the table if we do n't get a deal before the New Year , '' she said .
Murray added that she hopes `` it does n't come to that , '' and that she 's seen `` encouraging signs '' that Republicans are ready to deal .
The political strategy underscores how heated the debate over the Bush tax cuts has become , and how risky it is for the American people . President Obama is pushing for an extension of the rates only for American households making less than $ 250,000 , and a tax hike for those earning more than that .
Obama 's Democratic allies in Congress only want to pass that partial , one-year extension . Republicans only want to pass an extension that continues those rates for everyone . Each side is accusing the other of threatening to trigger tax hikes in 2013 .
Murray , while openly making that threat in her speech Monday , also preemptively argued that Republicans would be to blame if that happens . She also suggested that if Republicans do n't negotiate to her party 's liking on the automatic spending cuts -- known in Washington as the `` sequestration '' -- set to take effect at the start of next year , her party would let those cuts happen , too .
`` So anyone who tells you sequestration is going to simply disappear because both sides want to avoid it is either fooling themselves , or trying to fool you . It is going to have to be replaced , and that replacement is going to have to be balanced , '' Murray said .
Republicans claim Democrats are the ones standing in the way of relief for millions of Americans . In Republicans ' weekly radio address , Sen . Rob Portman , R-Ohio , accused Obama of pushing a tax hike that will hurt employment .
`` Raising taxes on employers and the middle class , growing government at the expense of free enterprise , piling on new regulations that increase the cost of doing business -- these burdens make it harder , not easier , to create jobs in America , '' he said . `` Today , instead of lifting the burden on job creators , the President is once again calling for a massive tax increase on nearly 1 million small businesses that employ tens of millions of Americans . I guess he still thinks the private sector is doing just fine . Well , the private sector is not fine . And raising taxes on job creators during a jobs shortage makes about as much sense as cutting off the water supply during a drought . ''
But Democratic Party leadership is apparently onboard with Murray 's plan .
Adam Jentleson , spokesman for Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid , told Fox Business Network that the majority leader has `` always said that we 're not changing anything until Republicans compromise and embrace a plan that includes revenues . ''","Senate Democrats appear willing to use your paycheck to play political hardball on taxes unless Republicans agree to President Obama's plan to raise taxes on America's top earners.

A top Senate Democrat warned Monday that, if Republicans don't relent, her caucus is willing to let all the Bush-era tax rates expire at the end of the year -- in effect threatening to let the country fall off what many in Washington call the ""fiscal cliff.""

That cliff is approaching at the start of 2013, when the Bush tax cuts are set to expire and billions of dollars in automatic spending cuts -- spawned by last summer's debt-ceiling debate -- are set to take effect. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are hoping to shift around those spending cuts to spare key areas like defense, and to temporarily extend the Bush tax rates for at least some Americans. Some have warned a failure to do so could send the nation back into recession.

But Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., indicated Democrats are willing to let the deadline pass in order to better their negotiating position.

""So if we can't get a good deal, a balanced deal that calls on the wealthy to pay their fair share, then I will absolutely continue this debate into 2013 rather than lock in a long-term deal this year that throws middle-class families under the bus,"" she said in an address Monday afternoon at the Brookings Institution. Murray is head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the campaign arm for Senate Democrats.

In the remarks, Murray explained that if all the tax cuts expire, then that will diminish the GOP argument that the Democratic plan is tantamount to a tax hike -- because come 2013, any change to the tax code would be a tax cut.

""We will have a new fiscal and political reality,"" Murray said. ""If the Bush tax cuts expire, every proposal will be a tax cut proposal and the pledge (to not raise taxes) will no longer keep Republicans boxed in and unable to compromise.

""If middle-class families start seeing more money coming out of their paychecks next year -- are Republicans really going to stand up and fight for new tax cuts for the rich? Are they going to continue opposing the Democrats' middle-class tax cut once the slate has been wiped clean? I think they know that that would be an untenable political position. And I hope this pushes them to come to the table with real revenue now before being forced to the table if we don't get a deal before the New Year,"" she said.

Murray added that she hopes ""it doesn't come to that,"" and that she's seen ""encouraging signs"" that Republicans are ready to deal.

The political strategy underscores how heated the debate over the Bush tax cuts has become, and how risky it is for the American people. President Obama is pushing for an extension of the rates only for American households making less than $250,000, and a tax hike for those earning more than that.

Obama's Democratic allies in Congress only want to pass that partial, one-year extension. Republicans only want to pass an extension that continues those rates for everyone. Each side is accusing the other of threatening to trigger tax hikes in 2013.

Murray, while openly making that threat in her speech Monday, also preemptively argued that Republicans would be to blame if that happens. She also suggested that if Republicans don't negotiate to her party's liking on the automatic spending cuts -- known in Washington as the ""sequestration"" -- set to take effect at the start of next year, her party would let those cuts happen, too.

""So anyone who tells you sequestration is going to simply disappear because both sides want to avoid it is either fooling themselves, or trying to fool you. It is going to have to be replaced, and that replacement is going to have to be balanced,"" Murray said.

Republicans claim Democrats are the ones standing in the way of relief for millions of Americans. In Republicans' weekly radio address, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, accused Obama of pushing a tax hike that will hurt employment.

""Raising taxes on employers and the middle class, growing government at the expense of free enterprise, piling on new regulations that increase the cost of doing business -- these burdens make it harder, not easier, to create jobs in America,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Republicans have also protested the proposed revenue increases and the fact the budget doesn't balance. The $3.8 trillion proposal aims to cut deficits by $1.8 trillion over the next decade.

What do we pay the most for?

Spending on the military and health care programs take up the bulk of federal income tax revenues, according to the White House.

A married couple with one child making $50,000 a year -- roughly the median household income in America, according to the U.S. Census Bureau -- paid an average of $995 in federal income taxes in 2012, just 1.99%.

This does not include Social Security and Medicare taxes.

Nearly a quarter of income taxes, $245.17, went to a category labeled ""National Defense."" A slightly smaller sum, $223.38, or 22.45%, was spent on ""health care.""

Ongoing military operations, such as the U.S. presence in Afghanistan, swallow the largest sum of defense spending, laying claim to more than 10% of taxpayer dollars, the White House said.

Medicare and Medicaid, programs for the country's seniors and poor respectively, take up nearly all of the ""heath care"" spending category in the income tax breakdown.

This does not include the separate Medicare Tax of $725, or 1.45%, levied on the family used as an example.

But there is other combined military and social spending included in other parts of taxpayer receipt, such as an entry for ""Veterans Benefits"" and a separate one for military retirement and disability.

The federal government spends comparatively little on education and the promotion of science and technology. Together, they all receive less than 5% of expenditures. This includes NASA's budget.

A major exception is the development and construction of weapons technology, which weighs in at 7.62% of total federal expenditures.

The biggest tax by far is the workers' contributions to Social Security, which weigh in at $2,100 for a family of three earning a median income of $50,000 per year. That's 4.2% of the family's gross income and is more than its federal income and Medicare taxes taken together.

How big are taxes and deficits?

Over the past 40 years, the federal budget deficit has amounted to 3.1% of gross domestic product per year, according to the Congressional Budget Office . That was well under the rate of inflation as measured by the labor department's consumer price index for half of those years.

At 3.3%, deficits are predicted to be slightly higher over the next 10 years, as rising health care and retirement costs notch up federal spending, the budget office said.

Budget deficits in the U.S. and much of the West surged with the onset of the world economic crisis in 2008, but began dropping in 2012, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development.

Trump said Friday that he does not believe voters have a right to see his tax returns , and he insisted it was “ none of your business ” when pressed on what tax rate he pays .
The remarks from Mr. Trump signal that he has little intention of disclosing verifiable details of his income or what fuels his wealth , a matter of endless speculation for a candidate who boasts of being a billionaire many times over despite his past brushes with bankruptcy and increasing reliance on celebrity-oriented income and licensing deals that use his name .
While not required to release their tax returns , all the major party presidential nominees have done so for roughly the past four decades , including President Richard M. Nixon , who released them despite undergoing an Internal Revenue Service audit . Mr. Trump has cited continuing I.R.S . audits of his taxes in refusing to release his returns .
When Mr. Trump was asked on ABC ’ s “ Good Morning America ” whether he thought voters had a right to see his returns , he replied , “ I don ’ t think they do . ”
Mr. Trump added of his taxes : “ It ’ s under routine audit . When the audit ends , I ’ m going to present them . That should be before the election . I hope it ’ s before the election . ”
But when asked by the interviewer , George Stephanopoulos , what effective tax rate he pays , Mr. Trump said , “ It ’ s none of your business. ” He added , “ You ’ ll see it when I release , but I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible . ”
The release of tax returns bedeviled Republicans during the 2012 presidential election , when Mitt Romney delayed releasing his until September . His effective tax rate , which was below 20 percent , was used by President Obama ’ s team to lampoon him as a wealthy corporate raider who was out for himself and who could not understand how regular people lived . Mr. Trump has said that Mr. Romney erred in waiting so long to release his taxes and should have done so sooner .
For many years , Mr. Trump ’ s wealth has been a moving target , subject to much estimation , debate and even litigation .
Last summer , when Mr. Trump filed the personal financial disclosures required of presidential candidates , his campaign released a statement saying that he was worth more than “ TEN BILLION DOLLARS , ” capitalizing the outsize figure . When the 92-page document became public , the disclosures by Mr. Trump indicated that he had at least $ 1.4 billion in assets , including his real estate developments and golf clubs .
Fortune recently pegged his worth at $ 3.72 billion . Forbes calculated it at $ 4.5 billion , as of September 2015 .
Mr. Trump disputed both numbers , just as he objected to an estimate a decade earlier when Timothy L. O ’ Brien , a reporter for The New York Times , wrote a book that placed the businessman ’ s net worth at $ 150 million to $ 250 million , based on three confidential sources . During a well-publicized episode , he sued Mr. O ’ Brien for defamation , but Mr. Trump ultimately failed to prove his case .
While his tax returns would not show Mr. Trump ’ s net worth , they would show investment income and where those investments are held , liens and the scope and type of his charitable contributions .
Kenneth A . Gross , a lawyer with Skadden who deals regularly with tax issues , suggested that the contents of Mr. Trump ’ s tax returns were certainly of public interest because they would provide insight into his finances that his previously disclosed financial documents do not .
“ Obviously it could raise issues about deductions , reporting of income , all sorts of things that we worry about when we file our tax returns , ” Mr . Gross said . “ There ’ s obviously something of interest because it ’ s being audited . It would be , I think , important to see what ’ s in these returns before he becomes the nominee of the Republican Party . ”
But Mr. Trump was adamant in his interview on Friday that “ people will learn nothing ” from his returns , noting how he had released his financial disclosure statement .
“ I put in financials , 100 pages worth of financials , that show that I built a company that ’ s worth more than $ 10 billion , ” Mr. Trump said . “ It shows cash . It shows cash flows . It shows everything . You learn very little from tax returns , but nevertheless , when the audit is complete , I will release . I have no problem with it. ” He added that he has no offshore accounts .
As the issue of Mr. Trump ’ s returns bubbled up over the past week , Democrats treaded relatively lightly on the matter , particularly since Hillary Clinton faces pressure to release transcripts of her paid speeches to Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs . But on Wednesday Mrs. Clinton seized on Mr. Trump ’ s reluctance to release his returns .
“ So you ’ ve got to ask yourself , ‘ Why doesn ’ t he want to release them ? ’ ” Mrs. Clinton said on Wednesday . “ Yeah , well , we ’ re going to find out . ”
She and Bill Clinton have released their tax returns going back to 1977 , when he first entered political life .
The I.R.S . will not confirm if a person is being audited or discuss their returns , but Eric Smith , a spokesman for the agency , said taxpayers are free to publicize their own financial documents at any time .
“ Nothing prevents individuals from sharing their own tax information , ” Mr. Smith said .
In a letter on his campaign website , Mr. Trump ’ s tax counsels wrote in March that his returns have been under “ continuous examination ” by the I.R.S . since 2002 because he has a big business . The audits from those returns from 2002 to 2008 have been completed , they wrote , but lingering questions about those returns remain , an apparent explanation as to why he will not release years no longer under “ examination . ”
The public interest group Common Cause put out a statement calling on Mr. Trump to release the tax returns , pointing out that he released returns from the early 2000s that were under audit to gambling commissions in New Jersey and Pennsylvania .
Mr. Trump has given different explanations for why he will not release his taxes over the years . In 2011 , when he contemplated running for president , Mr. Trump said he would release his tax returns when President Obama released his birth certificate . Mr. Obama made the birth certificate public in April 2011 , and Mr. Trump announced a few weeks later that he would not run for president .
Last year , Mr. Trump said he was still considering whether to release the returns , but he made no mention of the audits until this year .
Tax experts remain divided on the wisdom of Mr. Trump ’ s releasing his returns , with some arguing that it would be malpractice to advise a client to make such information public during an audit and others saying that he should have nothing to hide .
Robert J. Kovacev , a tax lawyer with Steptoe & Johnson who previously worked at the Department of Justice , said the scrutiny that Mr. Trump ’ s returns would face could add years to the audit because the I.R.S . would be pressured to examine details that critics of Mr. Trump seized upon . That could impose additional costs on Mr. Trump and disrupt his negotiations with the agency .
“ If you put it out in public , it ’ s almost like you ’ re crowdsourcing the audit , ” Mr. Kovacev said .
While Mr. Trump has said that he strives to pay as little tax as possible , Mr. Kovacev suggested that his returns could have information about offshore holdings or legal tax maneuvers that his accountants use that make his income appear lower or show losses .
Some tax specialists see no legitimate reason for Mr. Trump to hold back . “ When you file your return with the I.R.S . or any taxation authority you are filing your returns under penalty of perjury that what you are filing is true and correct , ” said Laurie B. Kazenoff , a former I.R.S . tax lawyer now with the firm Meltzer Lippe . “ You should be standing by what you filed regardless of any audit . ”","Photo

Kenneth A. Gross, a lawyer with Skadden who deals regularly with tax issues, suggested that the contents of Mr. Trump’s tax returns were certainly of public interest because they would provide insight into his finances that his previously disclosed financial documents do not.

“Obviously it could raise issues about deductions, reporting of income, all sorts of things that we worry about when we file our tax returns,” Mr. Gross said. “There’s obviously something of interest because it’s being audited. It would be, I think, important to see what’s in these returns before he becomes the nominee of the Republican Party.”

But Mr. Trump was adamant in his interview on Friday that “people will learn nothing” from his returns, noting how he had released his financial disclosure statement.

“I put in financials, 100 pages worth of financials, that show that I built a company that’s worth more than $10 billion,” Mr. Trump said. “It shows cash. It shows cash flows. It shows everything. You learn very little from tax returns, but nevertheless, when the audit is complete, I will release. I have no problem with it.” He added that he has no offshore accounts.

As the issue of Mr. Trump’s returns bubbled up over the past week, Democrats treaded relatively lightly on the matter, particularly since Hillary Clinton faces pressure to release transcripts of her paid speeches to Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs. But on Wednesday Mrs. Clinton seized on Mr. Trump’s reluctance to release his returns.

“So you’ve got to ask yourself, ‘Why doesn’t he want to release them?’ ” Mrs. Clinton said on Wednesday. “Yeah, well, we’re going to find out.”

She and Bill Clinton have released their tax returns going back to 1977, when he first entered political life.

The I.R.S. will not confirm if a person is being audited or discuss their returns, but Eric Smith, a spokesman for the agency, said taxpayers are free to publicize their own financial documents at any time.

“Nothing prevents individuals from sharing their own tax information,” Mr. Smith said.

In a letter on his campaign website, Mr. Trump’s tax counsels wrote in March that his returns have been under “continuous examination” by the I.R.S. since 2002 because he has a big business. The audits from those returns from 2002 to 2008 have been completed, they wrote, but lingering questions about those returns remain, an apparent explanation as to why he will not release years no longer under “examination.”

The public interest group Common Cause put out a statement calling on Mr. Trump to release the tax returns, pointing out that he released returns from the early 2000s that were under audit to gambling commissions in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

Mr. Trump has given different explanations for why he will not release his taxes over the years. In 2011, when he contemplated running for president, Mr. Trump said he would release his tax returns when President Obama released his birth certificate. Mr. Obama made the birth certificate public in April 2011, and Mr. Trump announced a few weeks later that he would not run for president.

Last year, Mr. Trump said he was still considering whether to release the returns, but he made no mention of the audits until this year.

Tax experts remain divided on the wisdom of Mr. Trump’s releasing his returns, with some arguing that it would be malpractice to advise a client to make such information public during an audit and others saying that he should have nothing to hide.

Robert J. Kovacev, a tax lawyer with Steptoe & Johnson who previously worked at the Department of Justice, said the scrutiny that Mr. Trump’s returns would face could add years to the audit because the I.R.S. would be pressured to examine details that critics of Mr. Trump seized upon. That could impose additional costs on Mr. Trump and disrupt his negotiations with the agency.

“If you put it out in public, it’s almost like you’re crowdsourcing the audit,” Mr. Kovacev said.

While Mr. Trump has said that he strives to pay as little tax as possible, Mr. Kovacev suggested that his returns could have information about offshore holdings or legal tax maneuvers that his accountants use that make his income appear lower or show losses.

Some tax specialists see no legitimate reason for Mr. Trump to hold back. “When you file your return with the I.R.S. or any taxation authority you are filing your returns under penalty of perjury that what you are filing is true and correct,” said Laurie B. Kazenoff, a former I.R.S. tax lawyer now with the firm Meltzer Lippe. “You should be standing by what you filed regardless of any audit.”",www.nytimes.com,left,4Wol0iW5tvONwL3t

The ""cliff"" is a series of tax increases and budget cuts that automatically go into effect Jan. 1 unless Congress acts.

Will Congress act?

It will! I see the future: The politicians will meet and fret and hold press conferences and predict disaster. Then they'll reach a deal.

It will just postpone the reckoning, but they'll congratulate themselves, and the media will move on.

America, however, continues to go broke.

""They're not going to admit that we're bankrupt, and they won't admit that we're on the verge of a major, major change in our society,"" says Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas. ""So they'll keep putting it aside, but then we'll eventually probably destroy the dollar.""

""They assume that they made it so bad that they wouldn't accept it, but I don't think they did,"" said Paul. ""They're not even ... talking about real cuts. They're talking about cuts in baseline budgeting.""

Right, the old baseline budgeting trick.

""If they propose, let's say, a $10 billion increase for next year and cut it down to $9 billion, they say they're cutting 10 percent. But they're not cutting anything, they're only increasing it $9 billion instead of $10 billion. It's done on purpose so that people get confused.""

But why? Trillion-dollar deficits are more terrible.

Cuts of $110 billion would even be good for us because it would keep money in private hands, away from the bloated and freedom-killing bureaucracy.

""When government spending is about $3.8 trillion, you're going to cut $100 billion? That's a deck chair on the Titanic,"" said Russ Roberts of the Hoover Institution.

A White House official told Fox Business Network that all options are still on the table . However , a detailed tax plan is still weeks away .
A complete tax overhaul will likely miss the August deadline set by Treasury Secretary Mnuchin . The White House is trying to learn from the failure of enacting a new health care law to replace ObamaCare and take a more active role in getting legislation passed .
White House aides told The Associated Press Monday that the goal is to cut tax rates sharply enough to improve the economic picture in rural and industrial areas of the U.S . However , the administration so far has swatted down alternative ways for raising revenues , such as a carbon tax , to offset lower rates .
Trump has not said which trade-offs he might accept and had remained noncommittal on the leading blueprint for reform from Rep. Kevin Brady , R-Texas , the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee .
Brady has proposed a border adjustment system , which would eliminate corporate deductions on imports , to raise $ 1 trillion over 10 years that could fund lower corporate tax rates .
But that possibility has rankled retailers who say it would lead to higher prices and threaten millions of jobs , while some lawmakers have worried that the system would violate World Trade Organization rules .
Brady has said he intends to amend the blueprint but has not spelled out how he would do so .

The White House has not officially commented on any plan , but said in a statement but said a value-added tax based on consumption is not under consideration `` as of now . ”","President Trump has gone back to the drawing board on tax reform as he looks for wide-ranging Republican support behind legislation to overhaul the tax system.

A White House official told Fox Business Network that all options are still on the table. However, a detailed tax plan is still weeks away.

A complete tax overhaul will likely miss the August deadline set by Treasury Secretary Mnuchin. The White House is trying to learn from the failure of enacting a new health care law to replace ObamaCare and take a more active role in getting legislation passed.

White House aides told The Associated Press Monday that the goal is to cut tax rates sharply enough to improve the economic picture in rural and industrial areas of the U.S. However, the administration so far has swatted down alternative ways for raising revenues, such as a carbon tax, to offset lower rates.

Trump has not said which trade-offs he might accept and had remained noncommittal on the leading blueprint for reform from Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.

Brady has proposed a border adjustment system, which would eliminate corporate deductions on imports, to raise $1 trillion over 10 years that could fund lower corporate tax rates.

But that possibility has rankled retailers who say it would lead to higher prices and threaten millions of jobs, while some lawmakers have worried that the system would violate World Trade Organization rules.

Brady has said he intends to amend the blueprint but has not spelled out how he would do so.

He speaks almost daily with Mr. Mnuchin and , according to congressional aides , it is apparent that he has the authority to speak on behalf of the secretary .
“ Justin ’ s leadership and expertise has been essential in advancing tax reform , which has been our administration ’ s top domestic priority , ” Mr. Mnuchin said in a statement .
Mr. Muzinich , who holds an M.B.A. from Harvard and a law degree from Yale , was relatively unknown in tax policy circles before he was plucked from Wall Street to join the Treasury Department . His most notable prior experience in the world of policy came while working on the campaign of one of Mr. Trump ’ s arch rivals : Jeb Bush .
Mr. Bush first learned of Mr. Muzinich because of his work as an informal adviser to the 2012 presidential campaign of Mitt Romney , another nemesis of Mr. Trump . While Mr. Trump ’ s personality-driven campaign was lean on policy , Mr. Muzinich was busy overseeing a team that cranked out detailed proposals for Mr. Bush on taxes , education and health care . Those attracted little public attention for Mr. Bush ’ s failed White House bid , but the experience gave Mr. Muzinich a taste of doing thankless work in a political caldron and managing big personalities under pressure .
One of the earliest iterations of the tax framework unveiled by Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans last month was the one that Mr. Muzinich drafted for Mr. Bush in 2015 . Like the current plan , that one would have collapsed the personal income tax brackets from seven to three and lowered the rates . It would have doubled the standard deduction , reduced the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent , and switched the United States to a “ territorial ” tax system , as the current plan would also do .

Policy has long been a passion for Mr. Muzinich , who regularly sought out opportunities while on Wall Street to publish essays on subjects ranging from foreign aid to the mandate of the Federal Reserve . Some of his earliest writing on tax policy could be considered heretical in an administration with a guiding principle of “ America First. ” In a 2007 Op-Ed article in The New York Times , Mr. Muzinich and a co-author , Eric Werker , called on Congress to offer tax credits to companies that build factories in developing countries and to offset the lost revenue with reductions in foreign aid .","On Capitol Hill, Mr. Muzinich is often paired with Mr. Cohn’s top deputy, Shahira Knight, to convey the administration’s views in big tax meetings. He speaks almost daily with Mr. Mnuchin and, according to congressional aides, it is apparent that he has the authority to speak on behalf of the secretary.

“Justin’s leadership and expertise has been essential in advancing tax reform, which has been our administration’s top domestic priority,” Mr. Mnuchin said in a statement.

Mr. Muzinich, who holds an M.B.A. from Harvard and a law degree from Yale, was relatively unknown in tax policy circles before he was plucked from Wall Street to join the Treasury Department. His most notable prior experience in the world of policy came while working on the campaign of one of Mr. Trump’s arch rivals: Jeb Bush.

Mr. Bush first learned of Mr. Muzinich because of his work as an informal adviser to the 2012 presidential campaign of Mitt Romney, another nemesis of Mr. Trump. While Mr. Trump’s personality-driven campaign was lean on policy, Mr. Muzinich was busy overseeing a team that cranked out detailed proposals for Mr. Bush on taxes, education and health care. Those attracted little public attention for Mr. Bush’s failed White House bid, but the experience gave Mr. Muzinich a taste of doing thankless work in a political caldron and managing big personalities under pressure.

One of the earliest iterations of the tax framework unveiled by Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans last month was the one that Mr. Muzinich drafted for Mr. Bush in 2015. Like the current plan, that one would have collapsed the personal income tax brackets from seven to three and lowered the rates. It would have doubled the standard deduction, reduced the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, and switched the United States to a “territorial” tax system, as the current plan would also do.

“What impressed me beyond his business experience, which is pretty unique, is that he’s just a policy wonk,” Mr. Bush said in an interview. “Justin has a desire to serve and he’s getting to do it at a high level, and I’m really proud of him for doing it.”

As the details of the House version of the long-awaited Trump tax bill roll out, all sorts of putative “winners” and “losers” are being identified.

Tea Party groups call the rules an attempt to justify IRS abuse

Correction: A prior version of this story gave the wrong date for publication of the proposed rule. It is scheduled to be published Friday.

WASHINGTON — The Obama administration is moving to clamp down on the growing political activity of ""social welfare"" tax-exempt groups, six months after controversy erupted over the IRS scrutiny of conservative groups.

The Treasury Department's proposed rules, released Tuesday, would restrict the ability of those groups to conduct a wide range of activities, from running ads to distributing mailers that target specific candidates to get-out-the-vote drives.

STORY: Scant evidence of fixes at IRS after scandal

Social welfare organizations funded by anonymous donors have become a big force in federal elections, reporting $256.3 million in political spending in 2012, according to a tally by the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money in politics. That's up from $82.7 million in 2008.

The proposed rules represent a significant change in how the IRS would treat social welfare groups. But a 90-day deadline for public comments, followed by public hearings, additional review and an implementation period make it unlikely that any regulation would be in place before the 2014 congressional elections.

Treasury officials would not discuss the proposed rules on the record, but said in the published notice that they ""wish to receive comments from a broad range of organizations before deciding how to proceed.""

The proposal completely avoids one of the most controversial issues: How much political activity — however it's defined — a group can engage in before threatening its tax-exempt status. That proportion isn't specified in existing rules but is widely assumed to be less than 50%.

""It's clear that the IRS is treading slowly into the waters, knowing that it's fraught with peril, and that they are starting to get ideas from people, which is exactly what they should be doing,"" said Donald Tobin, a law professor at Ohio State University. ""One of the big problems you had in this area is the IRS couldn't win. There are people like me who complain they haven't been enforcing enough. There are others who say they've been unfairly targeted.""

Tea Party groups denounced the proposal. Jay Sekulow, an attorney representing 41 groups suing the IRS, called it ""a feeble attempt by the Obama administration to justify its own wrong-doing with the IRS targeting of conservative and Tea Party groups.""

The IRS admitted in May that it had improperly held up groups seeking tax-exempt status based solely on the fact that they had the words ""tea party"" or ""patriots"" in their name. A list of targeted groups later obtained by USA TODAY revealed that groups were singled out for ""anti-Obama rhetoric,"" but that some liberal groups were also flagged for scrutiny.

STORY: IRS list reveals concerns over Tea Party 'propaganda'

IRS officials told congressional investigators that they applied a ""facts and circumstances"" test to decide whether activities were political. The proposed rules would replace that test with more objective criteria.

So, for example, any mention of a candidate within 60 days of a general election would be considered political, regardless of the context. The rule would even apply to mentions of a candidate that happened before the 60-day window, but which remained on an organization's website. But it wouldn't apply to third-party comments on the same site.

Sekulow and other conservatives argue that the rules would force groups engaging in constitutionally protected speech to disclose their donors, exposing them to political harassment. ""With this move, the Obama administration opens a new front in its war against political dissent,"" he said.

But the issue isn't speech, watchdog groups say. It's about disclosure.

The proposal ""provides hope that the IRS is going to shut down a huge loophole that has allowed political organizations to spend hundreds of millions of dollars without disclosing their donors,"" said Paul Ryan, senior counsel with the Campaign Legal Center, which has sued the IRS to clamp down on the political activity of tax-exempt groups.

This time around , Boehner has stronger hold on his caucus , and Obama is ceding less ground
Obama and Boehner had phone call on Wednesday , their first exchange in a week
Former White House official says lines of communication must stay open to reach a deal
President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner have been here before : a high-stakes showdown over the debt , visions of a grand bargain and a looming deadline .
Last year , secret talks between Obama and Boehner -- discussions that began over a round of golf -- fell apart . So what 's different now ?
For one thing , House Republicans who vociferously protested Boehner 's attempts last year to reach a bargain are somewhat subdued this time around and are standing behind the speaker . This is due in no small part to Boehner 's attempts to make clear that he is taking a firmer hand , said David Wasserman , House editor of the Cook Political Report .
`` Boehner was able to break the back of the tea party caucus in passing a debt limit increase last year , '' Wasserman said .
For example , four conservative Republicans who 'd vocally pushed back against Boehner on those budget and spending issues were removed from the House budget and finance committees for the upcoming congressional session .

`` He went against his nature in letting some heads roll from committees . He 's not known for ruling with an iron fist , '' Wasserman said . `` It 's a warning shot . He 's making an example . ''
After a weekly meeting on Wednesday of all House Republicans in which Boehner gave the loose outline of his offer , members of his caucus offered enthusiastic support . Most Republicans leaving the meeting said they think the speaker 's strategy is a good one .
New Jersey 's Scott Garrett , a leading fiscal conservative who has voted against GOP leaders in the past , said , `` The speaker has done an admirable job , I think , of being forthright -- so much fuller than the president has been -- saying , 'This is our plan . This is our offer . ' ``
Rep. Steve LaTourette , R-Ohio , a member of the House Appropriations Committee , believes that there 's a growing sense in the Republican Party that `` the president has won this round relative to the rates , '' but they still need to sit down and work out the spending part of the deal , which he feels can be reached if the president moves forward with entitlement reform .
Asked why this debate is different , Boehner said Wednesday that his GOP colleagues recognize what 's at stake .
`` I think our members understand the seriousness of the situation that our country faces . Trillion-dollar deficits for as far as the eye can see . $ 16 trillion ... every man , woman and child , the number is increasing every single year . As result , our members understand we 've got to solve the problem , and we will . ''
On the other side of the aisle , experts say , Obama , fresh from winning a second term and still smarting from what the administration sees as earlier rebuffed efforts at culling compromise , is n't keen to budge from demands that Republicans raise taxes on the wealthy .
In remarks to business leaders on Wednesday , Obama said Boehner and Republicans have to take the first step .
`` I think there is recognition that maybe they can accept some rate increases as long as it is combined with serious entitlement reform and additional spending cuts , '' the president said . `` And if we can get the leadership on the Republican side to take that framework , to acknowledge that reality , then the numbers actually are n't that far apart .

He added that `` we can probably solve this in about a week . It 's not that tough . ''
But the two men have had but one phone call over the past week , and that 's making compromise difficult , says one former senior official who served in the George H.W . Bush White House : `` There 's no communication . ''

This time around, Boehner has stronger hold on his caucus, and Obama is ceding less ground

Obama and Boehner had phone call on Wednesday, their first exchange in a week

Former White House official says lines of communication must stay open to reach a deal

President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner have been here before: a high-stakes showdown over the debt, visions of a grand bargain and a looming deadline.

Last year, secret talks between Obama and Boehner -- discussions that began over a round of golf -- fell apart. So what's different now?

For one thing, House Republicans who vociferously protested Boehner's attempts last year to reach a bargain are somewhat subdued this time around and are standing behind the speaker. This is due in no small part to Boehner's attempts to make clear that he is taking a firmer hand, said David Wasserman, House editor of the Cook Political Report.

""Boehner was able to break the back of the tea party caucus in passing a debt limit increase last year,"" Wasserman said.

For example, four conservative Republicans who'd vocally pushed back against Boehner on those budget and spending issues were removed from the House budget and finance committees for the upcoming congressional session.

""He went against his nature in letting some heads roll from committees. He's not known for ruling with an iron fist,"" Wasserman said. ""It's a warning shot. He's making an example.""

After a weekly meeting on Wednesday of all House Republicans in which Boehner gave the loose outline of his offer, members of his caucus offered enthusiastic support. Most Republicans leaving the meeting said they think the speaker's strategy is a good one.

New Jersey's Scott Garrett, a leading fiscal conservative who has voted against GOP leaders in the past, said, ""The speaker has done an admirable job, I think, of being forthright -- so much fuller than the president has been -- saying, 'This is our plan. This is our offer.' ""

Rep. Steve LaTourette, R-Ohio, a member of the House Appropriations Committee, believes that there's a growing sense in the Republican Party that ""the president has won this round relative to the rates,"" but they still need to sit down and work out the spending part of the deal, which he feels can be reached if the president moves forward with entitlement reform.

Asked why this debate is different, Boehner said Wednesday that his GOP colleagues recognize what's at stake.

""I think our members understand the seriousness of the situation that our country faces. Trillion-dollar deficits for as far as the eye can see. $16 trillion ... every man, woman and child, the number is increasing every single year. As result, our members understand we've got to solve the problem, and we will.""

On the other side of the aisle, experts say, Obama, fresh from winning a second term and still smarting from what the administration sees as earlier rebuffed efforts at culling compromise, isn't keen to budge from demands that Republicans raise taxes on the wealthy.

In remarks to business leaders on Wednesday, Obama said Boehner and Republicans have to take the first step.

""I think there is recognition that maybe they can accept some rate increases as long as it is combined with serious entitlement reform and additional spending cuts,"" the president said. ""And if we can get the leadership on the Republican side to take that framework, to acknowledge that reality, then the numbers actually aren't that far apart.""

He added that ""we can probably solve this in about a week. It's not that tough.""

But the two men have had but one phone call over the past week, and that's making compromise difficult, says one former senior official who served in the George H.W. Bush White House: ""There's no communication.""

The 41st president faced a similar budget crisis during his time in office, but the lines of communication were more open then, said the source who didn't want to be identified speaking about internal White House conversations.

""It was very clear that he realized by violating the no new tax pledge, he was putting his presidency on the line, and he was willing to do it for all the right reasons.

taxes,CNN (Web News),0,http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/05/opinion/salam-fiscal-cliff-millionaires/index.html?hpt=op_t1,Millionaires' tax bracket would be a smart compromise,2012-12-05,"Reihan Salam, Cnn Contributor","Story highlights Earlier this year Sen. Schumer , Rep. Pelosi proposed raising taxes on millionaires
Reihan Salam says their idea of a higher threshold than Obama 's $ 250,000 could work
Salam : It would n't raise as much money , but would be more politically palatable
He says another plus is that it would n't risk as much of an economic slowdown
Earlier this year , Sen. Chuck Schumer , D-New York , and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , D-California , expressed support for raising taxes only on households earning $ 1 million or more , a higher threshold than the $ 250,000 dividing line backed by President Obama .
Eventually , Schumer and Pelosi declared their support for the president 's position . But the $ 1 million proposal might serve as the basis for a bipartisan agreement .
A number of Republicans , led by Sen. Bob Corker , R-Tennessee , have called for raising tax revenue by capping deductions at $ 50,000 , a proposal that would leave virtually all middle-income households untouched while substantially raising average tax rates on households in the top 2 % of the income distribution .
A deduction cap is expected to raise roughly $ 800 billion in revenue above current policy , which is only half of the $ 1.6 trillion the Obama administration hopes to raise from high-earners . It is , however , an amount that many congressional Republicans appear to have deemed acceptable .
One of the central problems with a deduction cap , however , is that it is likely to be opposed by politically influential charitable organizations , which recognize that it will greatly undermine the incentive for high earners to make large charitable donations . Moreover , President Obama has insisted that tax rates on high earners will have to increase , though he has not made an explicit commitment to the Clinton-era statutory top rate of 39.6 % ( which compares to today 's top rate of 35 % ) .
So , is there a way out of this impasse ? Rep. Mike Simpson , R-Idaho , along with Reps. Tom Cole , R-Oklahoma , Bob Dold , R-Illinois , and Mary Bono Mack , R-California , have called on congressional Republicans to back legislation that would extend all the Bush-era tax cuts except for the high-income rate reductions , which would be allowed to expire .

Reihan Salam says their idea of a higher threshold than Obama's $250,000 could work

Salam: It wouldn't raise as much money, but would be more politically palatable

He says another plus is that it wouldn't risk as much of an economic slowdown

Earlier this year, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, expressed support for raising taxes only on households earning $1 million or more, a higher threshold than the $250,000 dividing line backed by President Obama.

Eventually, Schumer and Pelosi declared their support for the president's position. But the $1 million proposal might serve as the basis for a bipartisan agreement.

A number of Republicans, led by Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, have called for raising tax revenue by capping deductions at $50,000, a proposal that would leave virtually all middle-income households untouched while substantially raising average tax rates on households in the top 2% of the income distribution.

A deduction cap is expected to raise roughly $800 billion in revenue above current policy, which is only half of the $1.6 trillion the Obama administration hopes to raise from high-earners. It is, however, an amount that many congressional Republicans appear to have deemed acceptable.

Reihan Salam

One of the central problems with a deduction cap, however, is that it is likely to be opposed by politically influential charitable organizations, which recognize that it will greatly undermine the incentive for high earners to make large charitable donations. Moreover, President Obama has insisted that tax rates on high earners will have to increase, though he has not made an explicit commitment to the Clinton-era statutory top rate of 39.6% (which compares to today's top rate of 35%).

So, is there a way out of this impasse? Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, along with Reps. Tom Cole, R-Oklahoma, Bob Dold, R-Illinois, and Mary Bono Mack, R-California, have called on congressional Republicans to back legislation that would extend all the Bush-era tax cuts except for the high-income rate reductions, which would be allowed to expire. This remains a minority view among congressional Republicans, but it may well gain support in light of the popularity of allowing the high-income rate reductions to expire.

Another possibility is that congressional Republicans will embrace the Schumer-Pelosi proposal. That is, rather than embrace expiration for the high-income rate reductions for households earning $250,000 or more, they would accept it for households earning $1 million or more.

( Sept. 13 ) AP
WASHINGTON – President Trump is once again trying his hand at bipartisanship – even suggesting on Wednesday that rich people may be taxed higher under a plan he would negotiate with congressional Democrats .
After meeting with moderate members of Congress on Wednesday , Trump said he expects wealthy Americans to be `` pretty much where they are '' under a new tax plan – but it 's possible their tax bills could increase .
`` If they have to go higher , they 'll go higher , frankly , '' Trump told reporters after meeting with a group of Democratic and Republican House members who could hold the balance of power on close votes .

As part of his tax push , Trump also scheduled a private dinner at the White House on Wednesday with congressional Democratic leaders , Sen. Charles Schumer of New York and Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California .
The meetings come just one week after Trump made a deal to raise the debt ceiling with the Democratic leaders he referred to as `` Chuck and Nancy , '' angering some Republicans and scrambling their legislative strategy through the end of the year .
Buoyed by last week 's deal , Trump appeared confident about an even bigger agreement over taxes .
“ The rich will not be gaining at all with this plan , '' Trump said . `` We are looking for the middle class and we are looking for jobs – jobs being the economy . So we ’ re looking at middle class and we ’ re looking at jobs . ''

Some Republicans who generally oppose tax hikes said they would not reject out of hand Trump 's idea that the wealthy may face higher taxes .
“ That ’ s not a non-starter for me , '' said Rep. Mark Meadows , R-N.C. , leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus . Meadows says his priorities are cutting corporate taxes and doubling the standard deduction , but said , `` I ’ m willing to look at everything in trying to make sure that we get hard working American taxpayers the most relief that we can . ”
Trump has argued that cutting taxes and simplifying the tax code will spur economic growth , helping recovery in communities damaged in the recent storms .
Most of the House moderates – eight Democrats , five Republicans – who met with Trump on Wednesday belong to the self-described “ Problem Solvers ” caucus , led by Reps. Tom Reed , R-N.Y. , and Rep. Josh Gottheimer , D-N.J .
Trump and his team , according to White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders , will work with any Democrat `` willing to work with us to deliver this critical relief for the American people . ''
The president is in no way abandoning Republicans , she said .
Asked why GOP congressional leaders Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan were n't invited to dinner with Schumer and Pelosi , Sanders said simply : `` You 've got the leader of the Republican Party sitting at the table . ''
A tax overhaul is a key promise for Trump and other Republcians . Rep. Mark Sanford , R-S.C. , said the GOP base is “ very frustrated ” about the failure of Republicans to repeal and replace Obamacare , so the party must now deliver on tax reform . “ They want to see a pelt on the wall , ” he said of conservative voters . `` If it ’ s not this , I don ’ t know what it is . ”
Despite Trump 's enthusiasm for a deal , skeptics note that that neither the Trump administration nor Congress have a specific tax plan yet .
What 's more , Trump 's own positions remain unclear , as has called for reducing the corporate tax rate , a move that would benefit wealthier taxpayers .
And others questioned the connection between tax reform and hurricane relief – including key congressional Democrats such as Schumer .
`` With all due respect to the president , a tax cut , particularly one for the very wealthy , is not going to help Florida or Texas rebuild from these storms , '' the Senate Democratic leader said .
Economic analyst Stan Collender , a professor of public policy at Georgetown University , said the president has no way to leverage hurricane relief against a tax bill when it comes to votes in Congress .
`` Trump is n't going to veto a hurricane relief bill if it does n't include tax reform and Congress is n't going to be ready to do tax reform when the next relief dollars are needed , '' Collender said . `` More than anything , this shows that Trump does n't understand legislative politics or process . ''
Republicans are wary of Trump 's outreach to Democrats after last week 's deal with Schumer and Pelosi that secured a three-month extension of the debt ceiling and the current federal spending plan .
Trump 's dinner meeting with Schumer and Pelosi could open the door to cooperation on other fronts .
For example , Schumer and Pelosi are pushing to protect undocumented immigrants who were brought into the country illegally by their parents . Trump has announced the end of the Obama-era policy that protected these 800,000 young immigrants from deportation , and but he gave Congress a six months deadline to address the issue and has indicated sympathy for these immigrants .

Most of the House moderates – eight Democrats, five Republicans – who met with Trump on Wednesday belong to the self-described “Problem Solvers” caucus, led by Reps. Tom Reed, R-N.Y., and Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J.

Trump and his team, according to White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders, will work with any Democrat ""willing to work with us to deliver this critical relief for the American people.""

The president is in no way abandoning Republicans, she said.

Asked why GOP congressional leaders Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan weren't invited to dinner with Schumer and Pelosi, Sanders said simply: ""You've got the leader of the Republican Party sitting at the table.""

A tax overhaul is a key promise for Trump and other Republcians. Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., said the GOP base is “very frustrated” about the failure of Republicans to repeal and replace Obamacare, so the party must now deliver on tax reform. “They want to see a pelt on the wall,” he said of conservative voters. ""If it’s not this, I don’t know what it is.”

Despite Trump's enthusiasm for a deal, skeptics note that that neither the Trump administration nor Congress have a specific tax plan yet.

What's more, Trump's own positions remain unclear, as has called for reducing the corporate tax rate, a move that would benefit wealthier taxpayers.

And others questioned the connection between tax reform and hurricane relief – including key congressional Democrats such as Schumer.

""With all due respect to the president, a tax cut, particularly one for the very wealthy, is not going to help Florida or Texas rebuild from these storms,"" the Senate Democratic leader said.

Economic analyst Stan Collender, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University, said the president has no way to leverage hurricane relief against a tax bill when it comes to votes in Congress.

""Trump isn't going to veto a hurricane relief bill if it doesn't include tax reform and Congress isn't going to be ready to do tax reform when the next relief dollars are needed,"" Collender said. ""More than anything, this shows that Trump doesn't understand legislative politics or process.""

Republicans are wary of Trump's outreach to Democrats after last week's deal with Schumer and Pelosi that secured a three-month extension of the debt ceiling and the current federal spending plan.

Trump's dinner meeting with Schumer and Pelosi could open the door to cooperation on other fronts.

For example, Schumer and Pelosi are pushing to protect undocumented immigrants who were brought into the country illegally by their parents. Trump has announced the end of the Obama-era policy that protected these 800,000 young immigrants from deportation, and but he gave Congress a six months deadline to address the issue and has indicated sympathy for these immigrants.

Trump's bipartisan push this week began at dinner Tuesday night at the White House with a group of senators in both parties.

The White House said that Trump and his guests discussed ""advancing the administration’s legislative priorities, in particular tax cuts for the middle class.""

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who has clashed with Trump on some issues, said he would ""love to have the Democrats supporting and working with us in a constructive way on tax reform,"" but he pointedly added that ""we’re going to do it no matter what.”

Donald Trump has the right to keep his tax returns private and Democrats' demands to see them are ""harassment"", a lawyer for the president has said.

William Consovoy's statement hints at the shape of a possible future legal battle over the issue.

On Thursday a Congressional tax committee demanded to see six years of Mr Trump's returns, saying it was necessary to ensure accountability.

Unlike previous presidents, Mr Trump has refused to publish his tax details.

On Friday he said he believed that the law was ""100% on my side"".

Mr Trump has maintained his business interests during his presidency, prompting questions about possible conflicts of interest. Questions also remain about his net worth, tax profile and past financial dealings.

The Democrats gained control of the House of Representatives in mid-term elections last year, giving them the ability to launch investigations into Mr Trump's administration and business affairs.

What did Trump's lawyer say?

Mr Consovoy said the tax committee did not have a valid legislative reason to see Mr Trump's tax returns.

""His request is a transparent effort by one political party to harass an official from the other party because they dislike his politics and speech,"" Mr Consovoy said of tax committee chairman Bill Neal.

He said the request was a ""misguided attempt"" to politicise tax laws and could also end up interfering with audits. He said the US Treasury should not comply with the demand.

Mr Trump has in the past said that he is unable to release his tax returns because they were being audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

But lurking behind the euphemism and the sometimes-arcane details is a big debate about inequality , political power , and the nature of economic growth .
It ’ s no accident that by 2016 the richest 1 percent of the population had earned 24 percent of the income and held 39 percent of wealth or that household incomes at the middle are flat and living standards for the poor or falling . A new wave of research builds a persuasive case that tax cuts passed in the 1980s and 2000s were key drivers of this disparity .
Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans are promising another round of similar policies and they want to get it done soon . They firmly believe that tax cuts for the very rich will be a boon to the whole economy . They also know cutting taxes on the rich is unpopular , so they ’ ve cloaked their case in descriptions of “ simplicity , ” “ fairness ” and denying the premise outright .
But a tax agenda focused on corporate rate cuts , special tax breaks for businesses owners , estate tax repeal , and a reduction in the top marginal rate can ’ t help but make the rich richer — and a new breed of economic research , spurred by Thomas Piketty ’ s work but now joined by many collaborators , challenges the premises of the tax cutting drive , arguing that this kind of policymaking exacerbates pretax inequality while doing nothing for economic growth .
Democrats have grown more critical of inequality in recent years with Barack Obama proclaiming economic inequality to be the “ defining challenge of our time. ” Energy in the party shifted even-further-left and fueled an unexpected level of support for Bernie Sanders and an unprecedented level of skepticism about the basic fundraising model of American politics .
Even more surprisingly , in the GOP camp Donald Trump ran hard to the right on culture war issues while also promising a more egalitarian form of economics — promising to be a champion of working class interests .
But in office , while Trump has continued to obsessively feed the culture war maw , he is pushing a policy agenda that would add enormous fuel to the fire of inequality — enormous , regressive rate cuts flying under the banner of “ tax reform . ”
Redistribution went out of fashion in the 1980s . In the evocative phrase of Arthur Okun , It was a “ leaky bucket ” — transferring some money from the haves to the have-nots would reduce the total amount of money to go around . As long as economic growth was strong , as it was in the 1950s and 1960s , a hefty dose of redistribution seemed like a reasonable and humane policy .
But after the economic troubles of the 1970s , Ronald Reagan ( and Margaret Thatcher in the UK ) brought a new school of thought to town .
As Reagan himself put it in 1986 , “ one of the prime motivating intentions of this administration was to get the economy going again . And it was clear the way to do that was cut tax rates , stop penalizing initiative , and sit back and watch the fireworks. ” No more leaky buckets . Instead , the rising tide of growth would lift all boats .
Three or four decades later , scholars are able to look at the fruits of those policies and draw some conclusions . The same main technologies that exist in the United States and United Kingdom are also in use in Germany and Sweden . Those countries are also exposed to the forces of global trade and immigration . But inequality has grown much more sharply in the US and UK than it has in Germany and Sweden . And the main reason seems to be taxes .
Looking across the world in a series of papers , a line of academic research originally pioneered by Piketty and Emanuel Saez joined over time by a growing list of other economists finds that falling marginal tax rates on the rich are strongly correlated with higher levels of income concentration but don ’ t lead to faster overall economic growth .
The bucket , in other words , isn ’ t leaky after all . And though inequality is surely shaped by big forces like digital technology and globalization , it appears to be more profoundly shaped by tax policy .
Lower taxes on the rich straightforwardly engender inequality by giving rich people more money . But they also shift incentives . In the old days of 70 or even 90 percent marginal tax rates , it wouldn ’ t make much sense for executives to expend enormous amounts of time and energy trying to maximize the amount of money they can personally extract from a company in the form of salary . Instead , you might chase social prestige or other goals . And last but by no means least , tax cuts on investment income increase the extent to which wealth can mechanically beget more wealth as financial assets inherited from or gifted by parents simply earn their natural rate of return over time .
Instead of a rising tide lifting all boats , most families are left high and dry as the wealthy suck up a larger and larger share of an overall pool of money that isn ’ t growing very rapidly .
But while this new series of literature has gained a lot of adherents in recent years , the acclaim has hardly been universal . And last week , the Trump administration , through a report by its Council of Economic Advisors , firmly planted its flag on the other side of the argument .
Kevin Hassett , head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers , released a report last week touting the benefits of a steep cut in the corporate income tax rate that serves as one of the most significant policy developments of the year . It features a well-qualified economic policy team articulating what it is that right-of-center economists actually think about tax policy .
Cutting taxes for the rich has become unpopular , so Republicans have begun to adopt a range of obfuscatory strategies to deny that this is what they are doing . In mid-September , Trump vowed that his tax plan would not help rich people “ at all , ” echoing a pledge made in January by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to avoid delivering any “ absolute tax cut ” to the wealthy .
More recently , Mnuchin has backed off that pledge by pleading mathematics just makes it hard to not cut people ’ s taxes . “ The math , given how much you are collecting , ” he told Politico ’ s Ben White “ is just hard to do . ”
The truth is that it ’ s not hard at all . Republicans are proposing tax cuts for the rich because they think cutting taxes on the rich is a good idea . The CEA report is significant for saying so , relatively plainly , albeit in the specific context of discussing the merits of a cut in the corporate income tax rate . Corporations are owned and managed by people , so in the first instance a corporate tax cut goes to benefit the rich people who own the companies and the rich executives who compensation packages are tied to the share prices .
But to Hassett that ’ s not the whole story . A corporate tax cut makes America friendlier to the global investment community , and that , he says , ultimately serves to boost middle-class wages :
The deteriorating relationship between wages of American workers and U.S. corporate profits reflects the state of international tax competition . The problem is not unique to America ; countries around the world have responded to the international flow of capital by cutting their corporate tax rates to attract capital back from other countries . They have doubled down on such policies as they have seen business-friendly policies benefit workers .
The theoretical modeling behind Hassett ’ s later calculations is complicated , but this basic intuition is familiar . When Amazon announced that it wants to build a massive second North American headquarters , a dozen or more cities unveiled plans to dole out various forms of tax subsidies hoping to attract the investment .
Hassett ’ s contention , in essence , is that the best way to benefit the American worker is to engage in a global version of this subsidy game . Instead of targeted subsidies for new investments from one particular company , he and Trump want to offer a broad subsidy to all investment profits — old profits and new profits , real returns on productive investments and returns on monopoly rents — in the hopes of maximally catering to investor interests . By catering to the interests of the global investor class in this way , he thinks , we can do so much to boost the growth of the American economy that almost everyone will end up better off .
Hassett ’ s style of argumentation has been challenged by a new breed of inequality researchers in recent years . But it remains a reasonably popular one in the economics profession with a decent number of well-qualified and well-credentialed proponents .
Greg Mankiw , who held Hassett ’ s job under George W. Bush , has , for example , proposed eliminating the corporate income tax entirely and replacing it with a kind of national sales tax . Mankiw is also a longtime proponent of eliminating all taxation of rich people ’ s estates , another very concrete objective of the Republican tax framework . Doug Holtz-Eakin , a well-regarded former Congressional Budget Office director and current think tank leader , believes that eliminating the estate tax will create lots of jobs .
Estate tax repeal , by definition , only helps a tiny number of families directly . But as a pure tax on wealth , it ’ s also by definition very investor-unfriendly . And conservatives very sincerely believe that adopting more investor-friendly policies will benefit everyone in the long run . Republican elected officials rarely put it that way on the campaign trail because they rightly think most people disagree with them . But it ’ s the premise underlying their policies , and it ’ s what the policy experts they count on think is true . There ’ s no new populist alternative to Reagan-style trickle-down — there ’ s a culture war overlay and the stubborn belief that cutting rich people ’ s taxes will spark enormous growth .
The policy approach that Republicans recommend — bending over backward to appeal to the needs of rich global financiers in the hopes that they will bless us with some investment — probably makes sense for some countries .
Hassett ’ s precise calculations are based in part on the reality that a number of post-communist Eastern and Central European countries appear to have successfully implemented a strategy along these lines .
It ’ s worth saying this is the precise opposite of the bold “ America First ” sloganeering that Trump likes to deploy .
And there ’ s very good reason to doubt that it ’ s applicable to the United States of America . Fundamentally , we are not a relatively small , relatively poor country existing on the European fringe and hoping to pick up a German-owned factory or two to narrow the income gap with our wealthier neighbors . We are an enormous , wealthy country whose greatest companies — many of whom , incidentally , are located in relatively high-tax coastal jurisdictions — push the frontiers of human knowledge and technical expertise forward .
We ’ re also a country that right now is enjoying really low interest rates . Ultra-safe Treasury bond yields are low , but so are risky “ junk ” bond yields . The stock market , as Trump himself keeps saying , is at a record high .
What American lacks , as Trump himself used to say on the campaign trail , is a reasonable distribution of economic resources , world-class infrastructure , affordable health care , and affordable child care . Investing resources in creating the things Trump said he would create , rather than in kowtowing to the transnational financial elites he said he was fighting , would improve middle-class people ’ s lives in a direct and tangible way .
But rather than craft policies to do any of that , Trumpism is proving to be an enormous bait-and-switch whose strategy for boosting the economy is to recapitulate George W. Bush ’ s agenda of cutting taxes for the rich and hoping for the best .
The stakes in the Republican effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act were massive and obvious . Republicans were proposing revisions to programs that directly insure millions of people and that indirectly regulate the health insurance used by tens of millions more .
Citizens were interested in basic , obvious questions about it : Will my insurance get better or worse ? Will I pay more or less for it ? The repeal effort eventually failed in part because the answers — mostly higher prices for mostly worse insurance — were so unsatisfactory .
The stakes in delivering big tax cuts to corporations and investors could be equally plain if , ultimately , Republicans decided to fully offset their cost by raising other taxes or cutting spending on government programs . But it seems much more likely that tax cuts will , ultimately , end up being financed by a mix of new borrowing and wishful thinking on economic growth just the way Reagan and Bush did it .
In that case , the budget deficit naturally becomes an opposition talking point . But the real stakes are both larger and more abstract . The tax debate is , fundamentally , a debate about the rules of the economy and who they are meant to serve .
The theory that structuring economic policy to cater to the whims of financial elites will boost growth may or may not be true , but doing it unquestionable funnels more money into the pockets of the donor class that drives Republican tax policy . Economic inequality begets political inequality which begets more economic inequality and so on and so forth down the chain .
But the public ’ s view on this is clear . Voters want the rich to pay higher taxes and voters want big corporations to pay higher taxes . Republicans want the opposite , which is why Trump often says his plan won ’ t cut taxes for the rich and why his Treasury secretary is acting as if a tax cut for the rich is just some unavoidable mathematical fact . The CEA paper is , by contrast , a useful clarifying moment . The administration believes that more inequality is simply the best way forward on the merits .
The question is whether they ’ re going to get their way .","The debate over “tax reform” has, by design, a kind of bloodless technocratic sound to it.

Tax policy is a major driver of inequality

The Trump tax report is crucial because it’s honest

Kevin Hassett, head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, released a report last week touting the benefits of a steep cut in the corporate income tax rate that serves as one of the most significant policy developments of the year. It features a well-qualified economic policy team articulating what it is that right-of-center economists actually think about tax policy.

Cutting taxes for the rich has become unpopular, so Republicans have begun to adopt a range of obfuscatory strategies to deny that this is what they are doing. In mid-September, Trump vowed that his tax plan would not help rich people “at all,” echoing a pledge made in January by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to avoid delivering any “absolute tax cut” to the wealthy.

More recently, Mnuchin has backed off that pledge by pleading mathematics just makes it hard to not cut people’s taxes. “The math, given how much you are collecting,” he told Politico’s Ben White “is just hard to do.”

By catering to the interests of the global investor class in this way, he thinks, we can do so much to boost the growth of the American economy that almost everyone will end up better off.

Hassett’s view is broadly shared on the right

Hassett’s style of argumentation has been challenged by a new breed of inequality researchers in recent years. But it remains a reasonably popular one in the economics profession with a decent number of well-qualified and well-credentialed proponents.

Greg Mankiw, who held Hassett’s job under George W. Bush, has, for example, proposed eliminating the corporate income tax entirely and replacing it with a kind of national sales tax. Mankiw is also a longtime proponent of eliminating all taxation of rich people’s estates, another very concrete objective of the Republican tax framework. Doug Holtz-Eakin, a well-regarded former Congressional Budget Office director and current think tank leader, believes that eliminating the estate tax will create lots of jobs.

Estate tax repeal, by definition, only helps a tiny number of families directly. But as a pure tax on wealth, it’s also by definition very investor-unfriendly. And conservatives very sincerely believe that adopting more investor-friendly policies will benefit everyone in the long run. Republican elected officials rarely put it that way on the campaign trail because they rightly think most people disagree with them. But it’s the premise underlying their policies, and it’s what the policy experts they count on think is true. There’s no new populist alternative to Reagan-style trickle-down — there’s a culture war overlay and the stubborn belief that cutting rich people’s taxes will spark enormous growth.

Trickle down, not “economic nationalism” is the real Trumponomics

The policy approach that Republicans recommend — bending over backward to appeal to the needs of rich global financiers in the hopes that they will bless us with some investment — probably makes sense for some countries.

Hassett’s precise calculations are based in part on the reality that a number of post-communist Eastern and Central European countries appear to have successfully implemented a strategy along these lines.

It’s worth saying this is the precise opposite of the bold “America First” sloganeering that Trump likes to deploy.

And there’s very good reason to doubt that it’s applicable to the United States of America. Fundamentally, we are not a relatively small, relatively poor country existing on the European fringe and hoping to pick up a German-owned factory or two to narrow the income gap with our wealthier neighbors. We are an enormous, wealthy country whose greatest companies — many of whom, incidentally, are located in relatively high-tax coastal jurisdictions — push the frontiers of human knowledge and technical expertise forward.

We’re also a country that right now is enjoying really low interest rates. Ultra-safe Treasury bond yields are low, but so are risky “junk” bond yields. The stock market, as Trump himself keeps saying, is at a record high.

What American lacks, as Trump himself used to say on the campaign trail, is a reasonable distribution of economic resources, world-class infrastructure, affordable health care, and affordable child care. Investing resources in creating the things Trump said he would create, rather than in kowtowing to the transnational financial elites he said he was fighting, would improve middle-class people’s lives in a direct and tangible way.

But rather than craft policies to do any of that, Trumpism is proving to be an enormous bait-and-switch whose strategy for boosting the economy is to recapitulate George W. Bush’s agenda of cutting taxes for the rich and hoping for the best.

The stakes are enormous

The stakes in the Republican effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act were massive and obvious. Republicans were proposing revisions to programs that directly insure millions of people and that indirectly regulate the health insurance used by tens of millions more.

Citizens were interested in basic, obvious questions about it: Will my insurance get better or worse? Will I pay more or less for it? The repeal effort eventually failed in part because the answers — mostly higher prices for mostly worse insurance — were so unsatisfactory.

The stakes in delivering big tax cuts to corporations and investors could be equally plain if, ultimately, Republicans decided to fully offset their cost by raising other taxes or cutting spending on government programs. But it seems much more likely that tax cuts will, ultimately, end up being financed by a mix of new borrowing and wishful thinking on economic growth just the way Reagan and Bush did it.

In that case, the budget deficit naturally becomes an opposition talking point. But the real stakes are both larger and more abstract. The tax debate is, fundamentally, a debate about the rules of the economy and who they are meant to serve.

The theory that structuring economic policy to cater to the whims of financial elites will boost growth may or may not be true, but doing it unquestionable funnels more money into the pockets of the donor class that drives Republican tax policy. Economic inequality begets political inequality which begets more economic inequality and so on and so forth down the chain.

But the public’s view on this is clear. Voters want the rich to pay higher taxes and voters want big corporations to pay higher taxes. Republicans want the opposite, which is why Trump often says his plan won’t cut taxes for the rich and why his Treasury secretary is acting as if a tax cut for the rich is just some unavoidable mathematical fact. The CEA paper is, by contrast, a useful clarifying moment. The administration believes that more inequality is simply the best way forward on the merits.

The question is whether they’re going to get their way.",www.vox.com,left,bXxxcA0qoHKuJnMG

Republicans’ original tax plan collapsed months ago

The critical context for the current tax reform impasse is that House Republicans’ original vision for tax reform relied on ideas that have long since been abandoned.

Step one in that process was to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act in a manner that featured huge tax cuts for the rich while also offering long-term deficit reduction in the form of steep cuts to Medicaid. Step two was to replace the corporate income tax with a destination-based cash flow tax (DBCFT), essentially a form of broad-based consumption tax that Republicans thought could be marketed to the public as a kind of tax on business.

With those two elements in place, it would have been relatively straightforward to structure the rest of tax reform as something resembling a middle-class tax cut.

In effect, you’d be counting on Medicaid cuts and the new consumption tax to finance the whole thing. But this high-wire act collapsed long ago. Even before Obamacare repeal failed altogether, Senate Republicans removed most of the tax cuts for the rich from their legislative packages — recognizing that the politics of bundling controversial health care legislation with an unpopular giveaway to high-income families weren’t viable. And the DBCFT didn’t survive the slightest contact with political reality — provoking immediate opposition from retail chains and oil refiners.

But having abandoned these ideas, Republicans didn’t revise their basic premises. They even kept the 20 percent tax rate from the DBCFT plan and just carried it over to the new corporate income tax plan, even though all the deduction closing in the world won’t pay for cutting the corporate tax rate all the way down to 20 percent.

Does anyone really care about the deficit?

Back when George W. Bush was president, the GOP handled this problem in a straightforward way — pair huge, unpopular tax cuts for rich people with smaller, more popular tax cuts for the middle class.

The result was a large increase in the federal budget deficit, which meant that in order to qualify for the Senate’s filibuster-defeating budget reconciliation process, the tax cuts had to be structured to sunset after 10 years. During the 2012 lame-duck session, the cuts ended up mostly being made permanent after all — with a bipartisan vote large enough to overcome the filibuster — but the top income tax rate reset to its pre-Bush level of 39.6 percent.

The 7 million internal documents , dubbed “ the Paradise Papers , ” were handed over to German publication Süddeutsche Zeitung by Appleby , a Bermuda-based law firm , and shared by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in partnership with others news outlets , including the Guardian , BBC and The New York Times . The same organization was also behind the release of the Panama Papers . Like the Panama Papers , the Paradise Papers revolve around the issue of offshore entities set up by members of the global elite . The Paradise Papers reportedly pinpoint over 120 politicians and royal leaders around the world who have connections to offshore finance , according to NBC News .
Of those connected to our current administration , the top of the list would be Wilbur Ross , Trump ’ s Commerce Secretary .
Ross apparently has some business ventures in common with the son-in-law of Russian President Vladimir Putin .
The Commerce Department now says Ross has recused himself from any dealings that relate to transoceanic shipping , and also has reached out to ethics officials , in order to assure his moves are ethical .

Several news organizations have gotten their hands on leaked documents that have to deal with offshore accounts, tax havens and policies being influenced by some Trump associates and cabinet members.

And we’re talking big numbers.

To start:

The 7 million internal documents, dubbed “the Paradise Papers,” were handed over to German publication Süddeutsche Zeitung by Appleby, a Bermuda-based law firm, and shared by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in partnership with others news outlets, including the Guardian, BBC and The New York Times. The same organization was also behind the release of the Panama Papers. Like the Panama Papers, the Paradise Papers revolve around the issue of offshore entities set up by members of the global elite. The Paradise Papers reportedly pinpoint over 120 politicians and royal leaders around the world who have connections to offshore finance, according to NBC News.

The global elite… so not just the GOPe?

Of those connected to our current administration, the top of the list would be Wilbur Ross, Trump’s Commerce Secretary.

Ross apparently has some business ventures in common with the son-in-law of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The Commerce Department now says Ross has recused himself from any dealings that relate to transoceanic shipping, and also has reached out to ethics officials, in order to assure his moves are ethical.

So who else is named in the documents known as the Paradise Papers?

The president’s chief economic adviser Gary Cohn has held leading roles in 22 separate entities for Goldman Sachs in Bermuda between 2002 and 2006, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also directed a company in Bermuda in 1997, according to The Guardian. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman and House and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson are also mentioned in the leaked documents, according to The Guardian.

Ben Carson, too?

None of this is to suggest that what they’re doing is illegal. If nothing else, these documents are an inside look at how the very rich are able to secure their assets offshore, where they’ll be free from American laws on taxation.

And it’s all legal.

With Ross, the problem isn’t with the holdings he divested, but with the ones he held on to, then wasn’t forthcoming about during his confirmation hearing.

Some lawmakers who sat in on Ross’ confirmation hearing are saying they’d be a bit less willing to have been so accepting of him, had they known about Ross’ connection to the Kremlin through his holdings.

From NBC News:

In his letter to the ethics official of the Commerce Department, Ross created two lists: those entities and interests he planned to get rid of and those he intended to keep. The second list consisted of nine entities, four of which were Cayman Islands companies represented and managed by the Appleby law firm, which specializes in creating complex offshore holdings for wealthy clients and businesses. The Wilbur Ross Group is one of the firm’s biggest clients, according to the leaked documents, connected to more than 60 offshore holdings. The four holdings on the list of assets that Ross held onto were valued by him on the form as between $2.05 million and $10.1 million. These four, in turn, are linked through ownership chains to two other entities, WLR Recovery Fund IV DSS AIV L.P. and WLR Recovery Fund V DSS AIV L.P., which were listed in Ross’ financial disclosure prior to confirmation, but were not among the assets he declared he would retain. According to an SEC filing, those entities hold 17.5 million shares in Navigator, which constitutes control of nearly one-third of the shipping firm.

The listings seemed to be left deliberately vague, and some ethics officials have a problem with that. They feel the list was in code, of some sort.

This is still developing, so it really feels like something bigger is coming.

Washington (CNN) – Republicans want to cut the deficit. And Republicans want to cut taxes. Tuesday, those two sweeping goals collided as a GOP-controlled House committee voted to advance hundreds of billions in tax cuts at the cost of adding those billions to the deficit.

The House Ways and Means Committee voted almost entirely along party lines to make six tax breaks permanent at a cost of $310 billion over the next 10 years.

Follow @politicaltickerFollow @LisaDCNN

The top Democrat on the committee pounced.

“To say that Republican action today is hypocritical is a serious understatement,” Rep. Sandy Levin of Michigan said. “This approach today of Republicans flies smack in the face of fiscal responsibility.”

But the committee’s Republican chairman, Dave Camp, also of Michigan, did not blink. He responded that the tax breaks have been passed year after year without any offsets.

“This bill has been extended, unpaid for, probably 30 times,” Camp said of a research tax credit. “I think it’s important we extend this … supporting permanency, not a temporary extension.”

Team Camp also points to another argument: They believe the jobs that come from tax breaks are worth adding some red ink to the deficit.

“These are things that people feel are extremely worth adding to the economy,” said Camp spokeswoman Sarah Swinehart.

What’s $310 billion get you?

These six so-called “tax extenders” that the Ways and Means Committee approved Tuesday were plucked from a larger group of 55 tax breaks that expired at the end of 2013 and have been waiting for congressional renewal.

Among those passed Tuesday were three biggies: the research and experimentation deduction, the credit that helps small businesses with major equipment costs, and the break for businesses earning rent and interest overseas.

Camp was correct. In recent years, Congress has extended the breaks year after year without offsetting their costs. But in the 90s, most of them were offset.

Why the flashpoint now?

Democrats are particularly pressing the issue now because they see a conflict between the Republican demands that spending, especially on Democratic priorities like unemployment benefits, be offset while the GOP allows their own priority – tax cuts – to add to the deficit.

“It’s a clear double standard, particularly when you hold up unemployment,” said Chuck Marr, director of tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

But Democrats also have exceptions to pay-for pushes, notably, many Democrats believe that unemployment benefits are emergency spending and do not need to be offset.

When asked if that is a double standard from the left, Marr said no.

“Unemployment insurance is a temporary, countercyclical move,” he replied. “What Republicans are doing here is pushing for something permanent and unpaid for.”

GOP chooses tax cuts at expense of deficit

Republicans insist their decision to choose tax cuts over trimming the deficit is nothing new.

“(Chairman Camp) has the position that extensions of current policy and tax cuts don’t have to be paid for,” said Swinehart. “Pay-fors are for spending. New spending. That’s his position.”

Yet, in Camp’s recent sweeping tax reform proposal, he did pay for all the tax cuts he extended. He did that largely by repealing other tax cuts. But that proposal is not going anywhere.

Camp insists that’s not a contradiction. His office argues that paying for tax breaks is only possible in a comprehensive revision of the tax system, not when tax breaks are taken one by one as the House is preparing to do now.

The result: On Tuesday, Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee choose their anti-tax crusade over their image as deficit hawks.

Next, all Republicans in the House will face a similar choice.

In fact, there’s an astroturf movement based on precisely this notion. There was just a big conference, fittingly named the “Tax the Rich!” conference, hosted by a group called Patriotic Millionaires.

“Tax the Rich. Save America. Yes, it really is that simple,” they explain in their mission statement.

This slogan is simply dishonest; rich people do, in fact, pay taxes. Just under half (48 percent) of federal revenue comes from income taxes. If you define the rich as the top 1 percent — which is probably too narrow, depending on the region of the country — the rich pay a big chunk of that. In 2016, according to the Tax Foundation, the top 1 percent accounted for 37.3 percent of all income-tax revenue, a share that was greater than the bottom 90 percent of all payers of income tax combined.

This points to my real problem with all of this “tax the rich” talk.

Not only does this assume that the wealth of people who have paid considerable taxes still belongs to everyone, it’s also simple scapegoating. By my lights, it would be no less outrageous if the math added up. But it doesn’t, which makes it even more irresponsible.

John Kasich will roll out “ responsible ” tax plans that protect against revenue gaps . Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker and Arizona ’ s new Republican governor are delaying big dreams of nixing the income tax as they face budget shortfalls . And Missouri Republicans , once jealous of their neighbor Kansas ’ massive cuts , are thankful they trimmed less .
Republicans once idolized Kansas Gov . Sam Brownback as a tax cutting superstar — now he ’ s a lesson in what not to do .
“ It ’ s a cautionary tale on a national scale … Many of us felt that [ Kansas ] had been too aggressive , ” said Indiana Senate Majority Leader and tax committee chairman Brandt Hershman , who helped GOP Gov . Mike Pence cut corporate taxes last spring . “ We all like low taxes … but we have to ensure the stability of a revenue stream to provide basic services that our citizens expect . ”
It ’ s a major turnaround from two years ago , when Brownback was considered a Republican trailblazer for conservatives around the nation who dreamed of phasing out their state income tax .
Now , Republicans are rethinking how aggressive they can be on taxes in light of the projected $ 279 million revenue gap that ’ s plaguing Kansas this year — shortfalls that resulted in the state ’ s credit rating being downgraded and nearly booted the Republican from office in a state that bleeds red .
Of course , Republicans aren ’ t ditching supply-side economic theory or tax cuts . But they ’ re considering ways to avoid Kansas ’ troubles . Their takeaways include smaller cuts over extended periods of time , stopgaps to protect revenues — and avoiding overpromising .
It ’ s making for an odd dynamic in which some Republicans now proudly say their tax plans will be “ incremental ” or “ evolutionary ” instead of “ revolutionary . ”
“ Kansas did too much too fast , so at this point we ’ re continuing to look at our tax policy to make sure it ’ s competitive . But we ’ re not jumping — not following Kansas , ” said Missouri state Sen. Will Kraus , a GOP tax writer who in 2013 pointed to Kansas as the reason tax cuts were needed in the Show Me State .
Brownback , in 2012 and 2013 , signed a two-part tax package exempting 191,000 businesses from income taxes and lowering the top income tax rate for individuals from 6.45 percent to 4.9 percent . It sinks to 3.9 percent by 2018 and even further toward zero each year if revenue grows .
Although income taxes composed almost half of Kansas ’ general fund , Brownback said the cuts would grow the economy and attract new business , so that revenue would spring back quickly , essentially paying for the cuts . He had Reagan-era tax guru Arthur Laffer at his back supporting him .
But his plan didn ’ t pan out . Revenues are way down , and job growth remains below the national average . His own budget director says they may have to stop some of the tax cuts from going into effect , according to a New York Times interview .
Republican tax cutters in other states want to avoid that fate .
In Ohio , Kasich — a potential 2016 hopeful who has already cut $ 3 billion in taxes — is expected to roll out another income tax cut proposal in early 2015 . But two administration sources assured ███ they won ’ t have Brownback ’ s issue .
“ The governor worked very , very hard in order to balance our budget and restore fiscal responsibility , and we ’ re going to be careful not to do anything to threaten that fiscal stability , ” said Kasich ’ s budget director , Keen , when asked about the upcoming tax plan and lessons learned from Kansas .
Unlike Brownback , who slashed income taxes by about 25 percent right away then set up a system to reduce them more over time , Ohio has taken an incremental approach , giving taxpayers a 10 percent income tax cut over Kasich ’ s first three years .
They also have proposed to pay for additional cuts through a new oil severance tax increase . Brownback also proposed some offsets to his tax cuts — throwing out certain tax breaks — but legislators gutted those , making the cost of his tax plan soar .
Another difference : They won ’ t rely on optimist revenue growth assumptions , a major critique of Kansas ’ cuts .
“ The governor [ has ] insisted on conservative … revenue forecasts , ” Keen said .
Other states are looking at similar approaches . In Georgia , which is sandwiched by two states with no income taxes , Republicans want to lower the income tax rate . They don ’ t currently have the funds , said GOP state Senate Finance Committee Chairman Judson Hill , but when they do , they ’ ll protect against revenue shortfalls by taking things slowly to “ minimize near-term shortfalls . ”
In Iowa , state Ways and Means Chairman Rep. Tom Sands , also wants to eliminate income taxes but said they might have to go slow , starting with an optional flat tax .
“ Instead of just flat-out rewriting Iowa ’ s income tax code and doing away with all nine brackets … by doing the option , you ’ re letting people move to the direction they want to head , taking a little , smaller step to where we need to go , [ which ] doesn ’ t create the huge swing you might see in a complete income tax rewrite , ” he said .
In Missouri , Republicans like Kraus proudly noted that while Kansas eliminated taxes on small businesses , they did only a 25 percent tax deduction to lower their taxes . And their income tax cuts were much smaller , he said : only half a percent , phased in over five years starting in 2017 .
“ We ’ re trying to protect the core levels of funding so we don ’ t disturb … state government , ” he said .
By contrast , Kansas ’ cuts to education as a result of the revenue hit was a contentious issue in Brownback ’ s near defeat to Democrat Paul Davis last month .
Kraus also noted that Missouri tax rates would be drawn down further only if revenue hits a certain “ trigger ” threshold , protecting against big revenue losses .
Several Washington-based Republican tax wonks said such triggers are something they expect to see more of to safeguard against what happened in Kansas .
And their prediction seems to be on target . Hill in Georgia , for example , said a “ phased-in approach with certain milestones to be met before you trigger additional tax changes seems to be a wise and fiscally responsible way to do it . ”
In Indiana , Pence once pushed to ax the income tax , but now says the focus is streamlining tax laws and the state has “ no specific plans at this time ” to cut tax rates more , according to his budget chief .
“ The governor right now is focused on simplification and reducing the complexity of the Tax Code , ” said Chris Atkins , the budget director .
Hershman of Indiana said they ’ re in an “ evolutionary phase rather than revolutionary ” phase on taxes .
Republicans say they learned another lesson from Brownback : Don ’ t overpromise that tax cuts are going to spur job and revenue growth right away — be realistic .
“ You can ’ t promise that everything is going to change overnight , ” said Jonathan Williams , top tax adviser at the conservative policy group American Legislative Exchange Council , which lobbies states . Williams believes Brownback ’ s tax plan will pan out eventually , but he said messaging is key . “ It ’ s going to be a change of incentives over several months and years . ”
He said Republicans should tell constituents that “ not all tax cuts pay for themselves ” and warn about potential revenue shortfalls .
An Arizona Republican close to GOP Gov.-elect Doug Ducey , who wants to make serious changes to the state ’ s Tax Code , said they ’ ll communicate more realistically than Brownback : Though they think tax cuts grow the economy , “ we have never said decreasing taxes would increase state revenue . ”
Republicans have learned a budget lesson from Brownback , too : Make sure you have the money .
“ What Republican generally learned about the Kansas experience was to make sure you have the budget handled before you embark upon the tax changes , ” said Stephen Slivinski , a senior economist at the conservative Goldwater Institute , who added that “ if tax cuts are ever going to be in the offing , you have to handle the budget and do so in an honest clear way to make sure there may not be traps that might have befallen the Kansas effort . ”
At least two big Republican tax reformers are already showing signs that they ’ re taking this advice .
Walker has drastically scaled back his tax-cutting rhetoric since earlier this year and , according to two Wisconsin GOP sources , is putting his hopes to eliminate the income tax on the back burner .
“ I don ’ t want to say the Laffer theory is disproven , but it ’ s a difficult time to advance that way in Wisconsin because our revenue numbers aren ’ t as robust as we need , ” said a senior Senate GOP leadership aide , adding that Republicans were disappointed that Walker tax cuts from earlier this year didn ’ t grow revenue as much as they predicted .
Earlier this year , just before enacting the half-billion-dollar tax cut , Walker said it was just the beginning — that he wanted to eliminate income taxes . Now , a representative of Walker , asked about the elimination plan said the governor “ has only said that he would explore other areas of tax reform . ”
The state has a projected $ 2.2 billion deficit for the next biennium , 2015 to 2017 . There ’ s also a transportation funding problem .
Now , not even his top allies in the House think new cuts aren ’ t possible .
“ It ’ s more likely that we will not have an opportunity to do the same level of big bold tax cuts as we did in the past , ” said Wisconsin House Speaker Robin Vos , a key Walker ally . “ It ’ s unlikely we ’ ll be able to eliminate the income tax . ”
Elimination is also absent from Walker ’ s policy priorities document for his next term . He simply says he wants to “ reduce income taxes so that they are lower in 2018 than they are today . ”
In the meantime , Vos says they ’ re keeping an eye on Kansas : “ I definitely share the goals of the way … Kansas went , which is to say you want to reduce taxes on the people who create jobs so they reinvest by hiring more people . … But the jury is still out so I ’ d rather watch what happens for another year or two before we follow their lead . ”
Arizona ’ s new governor-elect is in a similar boat . Ducey ran on a platform of reducing income taxes as close to zero as possible , but his transition team is now facing a potential $ 500 million budget shortfall and court order mandating the state spend more on education .
So tax reform and tax cuts will likely have to wait .
“ Because we ’ re facing such a large budget shortfall , I haven ’ t heard anyone speak of cutting taxes any more than we already have , ” said Jennifer Stielow , vice president of the Arizona Tax Research Association , who sits on Ducey ’ s budget study committee that will offer up recommendations for his first budget . “ It ’ s not the environment to propose something like that . ”","Ohio Gov. John Kasich will roll out “responsible” tax plans that protect against revenue gaps. Wisconsin Gov.

“I don’t want to say the Laffer theory is disproven, but it’s a difficult time to advance that way in Wisconsin because our revenue numbers aren’t as robust as we need,” said a senior Senate GOP leadership aide, adding that Republicans were disappointed that Walker tax cuts from earlier this year didn’t grow revenue as much as they predicted.

Earlier this year, just before enacting the half-billion-dollar tax cut, Walker said it was just the beginning — that he wanted to eliminate income taxes. Now, a representative of Walker, asked about the elimination plan said the governor “has only said that he would explore other areas of tax reform.”

The state has a projected $2.2 billion deficit for the next biennium, 2015 to 2017. There’s also a transportation funding problem.

Now, not even his top allies in the House think new cuts aren’t possible.

“It’s more likely that we will not have an opportunity to do the same level of big bold tax cuts as we did in the past,” said Wisconsin House Speaker Robin Vos, a key Walker ally. “It’s unlikely we’ll be able to eliminate the income tax.”

Elimination is also absent from Walker’s policy priorities document for his next term. He simply says he wants to “reduce income taxes so that they are lower in 2018 than they are today.”

In the meantime, Vos says they’re keeping an eye on Kansas: “I definitely share the goals of the way … Kansas went, which is to say you want to reduce taxes on the people who create jobs so they reinvest by hiring more people. … But the jury is still out so I’d rather watch what happens for another year or two before we follow their lead.”

Arizona’s new governor-elect is in a similar boat. Ducey ran on a platform of reducing income taxes as close to zero as possible, but his transition team is now facing a potential $500 million budget shortfall and court order mandating the state spend more on education.

So tax reform and tax cuts will likely have to wait.

“Because we’re facing such a large budget shortfall, I haven’t heard anyone speak of cutting taxes any more than we already have,” said Jennifer Stielow, vice president of the Arizona Tax Research Association, who sits on Ducey’s budget study committee that will offer up recommendations for his first budget. “It’s not the environment to propose something like that.”

The Oklahoma Republican said in an interview with POLITICO that he believes such a vote would not violate Grover Norquist’s anti-tax pledge and that he’s not alone within Republican circles.

At a meeting of the House GOP whip team earlier in the day, he made the case that Republicans would strengthen their position by joining hands with President Barack Obama now to give most taxpayers what he calls “an early Christmas present” of ensuring their taxes don’t go up on Jan. 1.

Cole’s position is striking because he’s hardly a “squish” — Norquist’s term for a weak-kneed lawmaker — when it comes to Republican orthodoxy. Cole served as chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee and in other official posts within the party.

He might also provide cover for other Republicans looking to make an agreement to avoid a sharp fall off the so-called fiscal cliff.

Republicans are seriously considering a Doomsday Plan if fiscal cliff talks collapse entirely. It's quite simple: House Republicans would allow a vote on extending the Bush middle class tax cuts (the bill passed in August by the Senate) and offer the President nothing more: no extension of the debt ceiling, nothing on unemployment, nothing on closing loopholes. Congress would recess for the holidays and the president would face a big battle early in the year over the debt ceiling.

Two senior Republican elected officials tell me this doomsday plan is becoming the most likely scenario. A top GOP House leadership aide confirms the plan is under consideration, but says Speaker Boehner has made no decision on whether to pursue it.

Under one variation of this Doomsday Plan, House Republicans would allow a vote on extending only the middle class tax cuts and Republicans, to express disapproval at the failure to extend all tax cuts, would vote ""present"" on the bill, allowing it to pass entirely on Democratic votes.

Baucus ’ s plan to restructure the international tax system would lower the corporate rate by an unspecified amount , end a rule that has encouraged companies to accumulate about $ 2 trillion in earnings in their foreign subsidiaries and impose a 20 percent tax on those stockpiled profits .
The proposal is the first of three drafts the Montana Democrat plans to release this week . It will be followed by proposals on tax administration and capital-cost recovery . Baucus , who is retiring from Congress at the end of 2014 , said he wants to kick off discussions about revising the tax system .

Whether he can succeed is far from clear . Efforts by Baucus and House Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp to make the biggest changes to the U.S. tax code since 1986 are stalled , partly because of a partisan dispute over whether the government should collect more revenue as part of the changes .

Baucus has said he hopes to lower the new tax rate to less than 30 percent . If it were set at 28 percent , for example , the minimum tax would be set at 22.4 percent .
That rate would apply to a company ’ s earnings in each jurisdiction , so that companies operating in high-tax areas would owe no incremental U.S. tax on their foreign earnings .

The earnings that companies have accumulated under the current system would be taxed at 20 percent over eight years , regardless of whether companies have the money in liquid form and regardless of whether they bring it back to the U.S .

U.S. companies would face a minimum tax on the income they earn around the world under a plan released today by Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus that marks his most significant proposal to revamp the tax code.

Efforts by Baucus and House Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp to make the biggest changes to the U.S. tax code since 1986 are stalled, partly because of a partisan dispute over whether the government should collect more revenue as part of the changes. Camp is a Michigan Republican.

Criticizing Plan

Corporate groups, including the Business Roundtable, issued statements within hours that criticized the Baucus plan. Roundtable President John Engler, who represents chief executives of large companies, said the senator’s approach would make many U.S. companies less competitive.

Baucus’s international tax plan is designed to be revenue neutral in the long run. He would reserve the one-time revenue of about $200 billion from the tax on accumulated earnings for an unspecified purpose.

The international system is one of the most technically complex areas of the U.S. tax code and potential changes are being watched closely by companies including Pfizer Inc. and General Electric Co. that have significant global businesses.

General agreement exists across party lines on moving to a system that lessens burdens on companies that face lower-taxed foreign competition while tightening rules on U.S. companies’ tax-avoidance tactics.

President Barack Obama said today that the differences between the parties on business taxation “should be bridgeable.” Speaking at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council in Washington, he reiterated the administration’s support for a “modest, clear” global minimum tax without endorsing Baucus’s version of it.

Business Location

Each detail in Baucus’s proposal affects companies in different ways depending on how they have set up their businesses, where they operate and where they have located their intellectual property.

His plan will make it tougher for companies to claim profits in low-tax countries, said Ed Kleinbard, a tax-law professor at the University of Southern California.

“This is obviously bad news for tech firms and pharmas and others that have effective tax rates in the single digits,” said Kleinbard, a former chief of staff of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. “It’s impossible that they will maintain foreign effective tax rates in the single digits.”

Federal Rate

Under current law, U.S. companies owe taxes at the full federal rate of 35 percent on all income they earn around the world. They receive tax credits for payments to foreign governments and can defer U.S. taxation until they repatriate the money.

That system has encouraged companies to accumulate untaxed earnings in foreign subsidiaries. It also has created incentives for companies to move intellectual property out of the U.S. and into low-tax jurisdictions.

U.S. lawmakers such as Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, have criticized maneuvers by companies including Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. that have reduced their tax bills.

Many other countries, including the U.K. and Japan, have shifted to what’s known as a territorial tax system in which U.S. companies would owe little or no taxes on their foreign income.

The Let’s Invest for Tomorrow America Coalition, which advocates for a territorial system, said that Baucus’s proposal would take the country further from a pro-growth position. Coalition members include Oracle Corp., Johnson & Johnson and Cisco Systems Inc.

‘Cannot Support’

“The Coalition cannot support policy provisions that are punitive against globally engaged American headquartered companies and make them increasingly vulnerable to takeover by competitors who are not subject to similar tax regimes either in the U.S. or in their home country,” Claire Buchan Parker, a coalition spokeswoman, said in a statement.

Baucus, in suggesting a hybrid between current law and a territorial system, is proposing two options for his minimum tax. The first would tax all income from foreign sales and services immediately at a rate equal to 80 percent of the new U.S. rate.

Baucus has said he hopes to lower the new tax rate to less than 30 percent. If it were set at 28 percent, for example, the minimum tax would be set at 22.4 percent.

That rate would apply to a company’s earnings in each jurisdiction, so that companies operating in high-tax areas would owe no incremental U.S. tax on their foreign earnings. A company operating in Ireland, by contrast, would effectively have to pay the U.S. the difference between the Irish tax rate of 12.5 percent and 22.4 percent.

Narrowing Definition

The second option would set a lower minimum tax rate, 60 percent of the U.S. rate, while narrowing the definition of income eligible to only income from active business operations. Other income would be taxed at the full U.S. rate immediately.

The earnings that companies have accumulated under the current system would be taxed at 20 percent over eight years, regardless of whether companies have the money in liquid form and regardless of whether they bring it back to the U.S.

That tax would generate more than $200 billion, and Baucus hasn’t decided what to do with the revenue. Some could be used to ease the transition to the new system. Some could be used, as Obama has suggested, for infrastructure.

Devoting that revenue to rate reduction would make the plan increase the deficit in the long run.

“Tax reform isn’t going to be done in 15 minutes,” said Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat. “Starting with the international reform is, I think, very sensible, because this goes right to the heart of what you get asked about at town hall meetings, which is how do you make it more attractive to create jobs here.”

Camp’s Plan

In several ways, Baucus’s proposal is tougher on companies than the draft that Camp released in 2011. In particular, Camp’s one-time tax is smaller, at 5.25 percent. And Camp uses that revenue to make the permanent international tax system more generous for companies than Baucus does.

Senator John Thune of South Dakota said he prefers Camp’s approach.

“I want to see a territorial system, and I want to see a system that encourages people to to keep jobs in this country and to keep investment in this country,” said Thune, a Finance Committee member who is the third-ranking Republican in the Senate. “And I think today we don’t do that.”

Added Tax

Other features in Baucus’s draft include imposing immediate U.S. taxes on almost all income earned by companies from sales to U.S. customers.

It eliminates the so-called check-the-box rule that companies can use to have the Internal Revenue Service disregard some foreign subsidiaries for tax purposes.

Baucus is seeking comments from companies and senators by Jan. 17.

Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the top Republican on the Finance Committee, said he disagreed with Baucus’s decision to release the drafts while Democrats are proposing tax increases in a budget conference committee.

“My staff worked alongside the chairman’s for months, but the fact is that significant policy differences remain between both sides and a final agreement was never reached,” Hatch said. “I hope that once the budget conference negotiations have concluded that we can renew our discussions.”",www.bloomberg.com,center,mP47pwBavvomLnvp

taxes,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/2017/12/20/16790040/gop-tax-bill-winners,4 winners and 4 losers from the Republican tax bill,2017-12-20,"Tara Golshan, German Lopez, Brian Resnick, Aaron Rupar","President Donald Trump and Republicans promised a tax bill by Christmas , and on that front they have delivered .
On Friday , Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law , a $ 1.5 trillion proposal that gives corporations a massive permanent tax break , temporarily cuts rates for individuals , and repeals the Affordable Care Act ’ s individual mandate — a move that is estimated to leave 13 million fewer insured in the next 10 years .
Republicans haven ’ t let the fact that the bill is full of broken promises stand in the way of notching a legislative win by the year ’ s end . The final bill lowers the corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent , gives pass-through businesses like the Trump Organization a 20 percent tax deduction , increases the standard deduction , expands the child tax credit , and temporarily lowers individual rates across the board .
It ’ s a bill that by almost every official analysis overwhelmingly benefits America ’ s highest earners , and doesn ’ t do much to simplify the tax code . But as Republicans said , in the first year almost all Americans will see at least a marginal decline in their taxes .
Here are some of the major winners and losers from this GOP tax plan .
A massive corporate tax cut has been the centerpiece of the Republican tax plan from the beginning . This bill permanently cuts the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent to bring it closer to that of countries like Canada , which has a 15 percent corporate tax rate , or Ireland , which has a 12.5 percent rate .
Republicans also repealed the 20 percent corporate alternative minimum tax , which was set up in the current tax code to ensure that corporations paid at least some taxes .
The bill also changes tax provisions for American companies abroad : Corporations will no longer have to pay corporate taxes on money they claim to have earned abroad — a move that could encourage companies to keep income in foreign tax havens . Corporate income brought back to the United States will be taxed between 8 and 15.5 percent , instead of the current 35 percent .
The idea is that the lower tax rate will push corporations to invest more in the United State , raise wages , increase jobs , and unleash unprecedented economic growth .
“ It ’ s in all of our best interest to have these tax cuts for corporations so that they will have more money to invest in their business and pay their workers , ” Rep. Mike Conaway ( R-TX ) said .
By most analyses , this is largely a false promise . The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , pulling together assessments from the Congressional Budget Office , the Joint Committee on Taxation , the Tax Policy Center , the Treasury ’ s Office of Tax Analysis , and the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy , found that workers would only receive a quarter or less of the benefits from tax cuts — and among those workers , it ’ s likely the higher earners that would benefit .
While it ’ s true that the United States ’ corporate tax rate is exceptionally high on paper , the actual rate that corporations currently pay is much lower than 35 percent .
“ Our corporate tax code is riddled with loopholes , and what corporations pay is far , far lower — somewhere between 13 and 21 percent , ” Hunter Blair , a tax and budget analyst at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute , told ███ . The Congressional Budget Office puts the United States ’ current effective corporate tax rate at 18.6 percent , lower than that of some countries in Europe and Asia .
While the Republican bill closed some of these smaller loopholes , many of the major ones remain intact , making this massive tax cut into a bonanza for corporate America .
There ’ s no question that this is a big victory for President Donald Trump — both personally and politically .
After Republicans spent the greater part of the year pushing unsuccessfully to repeal Obamacare , tax reform was the last frontier for major legislative change in Trump ’ s first year in office — a reality that served as a major motivator to get the tax bill done by Christmas .
But in addition to getting a legislative win under his belt , this tax bill is also good for Trump and those in his family , personally .
Trump and his administration have continued to insist that high earners like Trump would not benefit from this tax bill . The “ rich will not be gaining at all ” with the tax bill , Trump said . Another time he promised that bill would cost him a “ fortune . ”
Trump , and the ultrarich like him , would benefit in several ways . First , the tax bill cuts the top individual tax rate to 37 percent from 39.6 percent . Next , it also increases the exemption on what Republicans call the “ death tax ” — the 40 percent tax ( after deducting donations and spousal gifts ) on the wealth of deceased persons before it ’ s distributed to their heirs — from $ 11 million to $ 22 million for married couples .
Trump would also benefit from the tax bill ’ s “ pass-through ” provision , which Republicans say is aimed at helping small businesses , but also give wealthy investors , like Trump , a major windfall .
Currently , owners of pass-through companies , like LLCs , partnerships , sole proprietorships , and S corporations — the Trump Organization , for example — are taxed as personal income . The Republican tax bill will now give pass-through businesses a 20 percent deduction , in addition to cutting the top individual tax rate .
The Trump Organization is a large pass-through ; the holding company owns golf courses and hotels and pulls in about $ 9.5 billion in annual revenue . But because it is exempt from the corporate income tax , and its profits are instead taxed upon distribution to shareholders , this tax break for pass-through income is a huge win for the Trump family — and the many other businesspeople who structure their companies like this .
As ███ ’ s Dylan Matthews explained , there are some provisions in the proposal meant to prevent rich individuals from using this tax break as a way to shelter income , but they only limit the benefit in many cases . In fact , the final tax bill extends the pass-through deduction even to pass-throughs that aren ’ t paying wages or creating jobs — in other words , wealthy real estate investors like Trump or Jared Kushner benefit from the new law .
Republicans have promised a “ giant ” tax cut for Christmas — across the board .
In the short term , those will come to fruition . The Republican tax plan lowers the individual tax rates and increases the standard deduction .
Most middle-class taxpayers would land in the 12 percent bracket ; upper-middle-class households go from the 25 percent bracket to 22 percent , or from 33 percent to 24 percent , or from 39.6 percent to 35 percent . Families will also be able to benefit from a slightly expanded child tax credit .
According to an analysis from the Tax Policy Center , the bill would reduce taxes for Americans in all income groups in 2018 — increasing after-tax income by an average of 2.2 percent .
The tax cut for individuals will slowly decrease over time — and end altogether in 2025 .
As Matthews explains , the thresholds for individual tax brackets are adjusted according to chained CPI , a lower measure of inflation than standard CPI , which is used currently . This will increase tax revenue over time by pushing people into higher tax brackets .
Then in 2025 , the individual tax relief in the Republican tax bill expires altogether . This is due to a Senate budget rule that restricts the cost of the tax bill to $ 1.5 trillion . Republicans decided to sunset nearly all the individual tax cuts in order to make the corporate tax cuts permanent .
The result will be a tax increase in 2027 for more than half of all Americans — 53 percent , according to an analysis from the Tax Policy Center .
The corporate tax cut , along with the bill ’ s other tax cuts , is expensive . The tax bill costs $ 1.46 trillion over 10 years — or roughly $ 1 trillion when adjusted for economic growth . Either way , it ’ s a substantial impact on the deficit .
You ’ d expect conservatives who have spent their careers decrying the dangers of the national debt to shudder at such an estimate . But not so much .
Fiscal conservatives and deficit hawks seem to have changed their tune , all in the name of massive tax cuts that would primarily benefit the wealthy .
“ Sometimes you have to go into a little bit of debt to make your business stronger , ” Rep. Jim Renacci ( R-OH ) said when the House was passing the budget , which gave Republicans a green light to go ahead with a partisan tax bill .
In their budget reconciliation instructions , Republicans allow for this bill to carve a $ 1.5 trillion hole in the deficit over the first 10 years . Due to Senate rules , the bill ultimately can not increase the deficit any more after the 10-year mark . To meet this requirement , Republicans end almost all the individual tax cuts in 2025 , and make the corporate tax cuts permanent .
But House Speaker Paul Ryan says Republicans have every “ intent ” to renew the individual tax cuts in 2025 , to ensure taxes don ’ t go up for individual Americans . It ’ s up to whoever sits in Congress in the future .
If Congress does in fact renew the individual tax cuts , the actual impact on the deficit would be much greater than the current estimates . The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that expiring the individual tax cuts in the bill hides between $ 570 billion and $ 725 billion of potential costs . In other words , the bill could actually increase the deficit by $ 2 trillion to $ 2.2 trillion .
Republicans continue to insist that their tax bill will lead to unprecedented economic growth to make up for these costs , but there ’ s some dubious math that goes into that expectation , including a very rosy calculation for economic growth . The Treasury Department even included legislation that hasn ’ t even been introduced — like an infrastructure bill — in its analysis of the tax bill ’ s impact on economic growth .
Twelve Republicans voted against the final tax bill in the House . Eleven of those 12 were Republicans from New York , New Jersey , and California — high-tax blue states that are disproportionately disadvantaged by this tax bill .
The defections stem from two major changes to the tax code , meant to help offset the cost of a massive tax break for corporations .
The bill changes the mortgage interest deduction , lowering the cap for newly issued loans to $ 750,000 from the current $ 1 million threshold . Those in the real estate industry say this would reduce the incentive to buy and build homes , which could affect lenders , construction companies , and real estate firms . It also disproportionately impacts states with higher home prices , like California , New York , and New Jersey .
Americans in Democratic-leaning states , which typically have higher income and property taxes , are also adversely affected by this bill ’ s new $ 10,000 cap on the state and local income and property tax deduction .
Republicans in support of the bill say neither of these changes will impact Americans because of the increased standard deduction , as people are less likely to itemize their deductions — but it was enough to lose the votes of 11 blue-state Republicans .
Trump has often invoked tax accountants when pitching the tax bill to the American public .
Promising a tax code that “ simple and easy to understand ” at a rally earlier this year , Trump said : “ Sorry . H & R Block will not be supporting Donald Trump , I can tell you , ” insinuating that the new simplified tax code would put tax accountants like H & R Block out of work . H & R Block ’ s stock dropped this fall , some of which was associated with the anticipation of a Republican tax reform bill .
But tax accountants can rest assured : They will still have jobs .
Republicans passed a tax bill that does very little to actually simplify the tax code . Despite early efforts from the House , which passed a version of the tax bill that condensed the current seven tax brackets to four and cut many of the deductions — like those for teachers ’ supplies and high medical expenses — the final draft of the tax bill does no such thing .
As Jim Tankersley wrote for the New York Times , this tax bill “ creates as many new preferences for special interests as it gets rid of ” :
It will keep corporate accountants busy for years to come . And no taxpayer will ever see the postcard-size tax return that President Trump laid a kiss on in November as Republican leaders launched their tax overhaul effort .

The tax bill isn ’ t just a tax bill . It ’ s also a health care bill .
Republicans have agreed to repeal the Affordable Care Act ’ s individual mandate , which taxes Americans who don ’ t purchase health insurance . Republicans are calling it a blow to the “ heart ” of Obamacare , which they failed to repeal earlier this year .
The impact of repealing the individual mandate could be serious . The Congressional Budget Office estimates that it could leave as many as 13 million fewer insured over the next 10 years , and increase premiums by an average 10 percent over the next decade .
To win over concerned moderates in the Senate on the tax bill , Republican leadership hatched a plan to simultaneously pass a bill to stabilize the Obamacare marketplaces with the tax bill — a proposal negotiated by Sens . Lamar Alexander ( R-TN ) and Patty Murray ( D-WA ) .
But the CBO found passing the Alexander-Murray proposal — the centerpiece of which is funding Obamacare ’ s cost-sharing reduction subsidies , which Trump has threatened to pull — would not in fact mitigate the coverage losses and premium hikes triggered by repealing the individual mandate .
“ If legislation were enacted that incorporated both the provisions of the Bipartisan Health Care Stabilization Act and a repeal of the individual mandate ... the effects on the premiums and the number of people with health insurance coverage would be similar , ” Keith Hall , the CBO ’ s director , wrote in a letter to Murray .
It ’ s still an open question whether the House is on board to pass the CSR payments . On Tuesday , Speaker Ryan received pushback from Republican members over the possibility of passing an Obamacare stabilization package .
Either way , people on the Obamacare exchanges will likely lose out .","President Donald Trump and Republicans promised a tax bill by Christmas, and on that front they have delivered.

On Friday, Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law, a $1.5 trillion proposal that gives corporations a massive permanent tax break, temporarily cuts rates for individuals, and repeals the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate — a move that is estimated to leave 13 million fewer insured in the next 10 years.

Congress passed the bill Wednesday.

Republicans haven’t let the fact that the bill is full of broken promises stand in the way of notching a legislative win by the year’s end. The final bill lowers the corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, gives pass-through businesses like the Trump Organization a 20 percent tax deduction, increases the standard deduction, expands the child tax credit, and temporarily lowers individual rates across the board.

It’s a bill that by almost every official analysis overwhelmingly benefits America’s highest earners, and doesn’t do much to simplify the tax code. But as Republicans said, in the first year almost all Americans will see at least a marginal decline in their taxes.

Here are some of the major winners and losers from this GOP tax plan.

Winner: corporate America

A massive corporate tax cut has been the centerpiece of the Republican tax plan from the beginning. This bill permanently cuts the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent to bring it closer to that of countries like Canada, which has a 15 percent corporate tax rate, or Ireland, which has a 12.5 percent rate.

Republicans also repealed the 20 percent corporate alternative minimum tax, which was set up in the current tax code to ensure that corporations paid at least some taxes.

The bill also changes tax provisions for American companies abroad: Corporations will no longer have to pay corporate taxes on money they claim to have earned abroad — a move that could encourage companies to keep income in foreign tax havens. Corporate income brought back to the United States will be taxed between 8 and 15.5 percent, instead of the current 35 percent.

The idea is that the lower tax rate will push corporations to invest more in the United State, raise wages, increase jobs, and unleash unprecedented economic growth.

“It’s in all of our best interest to have these tax cuts for corporations so that they will have more money to invest in their business and pay their workers,” Rep. Mike Conaway (R-TX) said.

By most analyses, this is largely a false promise. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, pulling together assessments from the Congressional Budget Office, the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Tax Policy Center, the Treasury’s Office of Tax Analysis, and the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, found that workers would only receive a quarter or less of the benefits from tax cuts — and among those workers, it’s likely the higher earners that would benefit.

While it’s true that the United States’ corporate tax rate is exceptionally high on paper, the actual rate that corporations currently pay is much lower than 35 percent.

“Our corporate tax code is riddled with loopholes, and what corporations pay is far, far lower — somewhere between 13 and 21 percent,” Hunter Blair, a tax and budget analyst at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, told Vox. The Congressional Budget Office puts the United States’ current effective corporate tax rate at 18.6 percent, lower than that of some countries in Europe and Asia.

While the Republican bill closed some of these smaller loopholes, many of the major ones remain intact, making this massive tax cut into a bonanza for corporate America.

Winner: Donald Trump

There’s no question that this is a big victory for President Donald Trump — both personally and politically.

After Republicans spent the greater part of the year pushing unsuccessfully to repeal Obamacare, tax reform was the last frontier for major legislative change in Trump’s first year in office — a reality that served as a major motivator to get the tax bill done by Christmas.

But in addition to getting a legislative win under his belt, this tax bill is also good for Trump and those in his family, personally.

Trump and his administration have continued to insist that high earners like Trump would not benefit from this tax bill. The “rich will not be gaining at all” with the tax bill, Trump said. Another time he promised that bill would cost him a “fortune.”

That’s not true.

Trump, and the ultrarich like him, would benefit in several ways. First, the tax bill cuts the top individual tax rate to 37 percent from 39.6 percent. Next, it also increases the exemption on what Republicans call the “death tax” — the 40 percent tax (after deducting donations and spousal gifts) on the wealth of deceased persons before it’s distributed to their heirs — from $11 million to $22 million for married couples.

Trump would also benefit from the tax bill’s “pass-through” provision, which Republicans say is aimed at helping small businesses, but also give wealthy investors, like Trump, a major windfall.

Currently, owners of pass-through companies, like LLCs, partnerships, sole proprietorships, and S corporations — the Trump Organization, for example — are taxed as personal income. The Republican tax bill will now give pass-through businesses a 20 percent deduction, in addition to cutting the top individual tax rate.

The Trump Organization is a large pass-through; the holding company owns golf courses and hotels and pulls in about $9.5 billion in annual revenue. But because it is exempt from the corporate income tax, and its profits are instead taxed upon distribution to shareholders, this tax break for pass-through income is a huge win for the Trump family — and the many other businesspeople who structure their companies like this.

As Vox’s Dylan Matthews explained, there are some provisions in the proposal meant to prevent rich individuals from using this tax break as a way to shelter income, but they only limit the benefit in many cases. In fact, the final tax bill extends the pass-through deduction even to pass-throughs that aren’t paying wages or creating jobs — in other words, wealthy real estate investors like Trump or Jared Kushner benefit from the new law.

Winner: individual taxpayers — for the short term

Republicans have promised a “giant” tax cut for Christmas — across the board.

In the short term, those will come to fruition. The Republican tax plan lowers the individual tax rates and increases the standard deduction.

In 2017, for a married couple the brackets are:

10% (taxable income up to $18,650)

15% ($18,650 to $75,900)

25% ($75,900 to $153,100)

28% ($153,100 to $233,350)

33% ($233,350 to $416,700)

35% ($416,700 to $470,700)

39.6% (taxable income over $470,700)

Under the new plan they’d be:

10% (taxable income up to $19,050)

12% ($19,050 to $77,400)

22% ($77,400 to $165,000)

24% ($165,000 to $315,000)

32% ($315,000 to $400,000)

35% ($400,000 to $600,000)

37% (taxable income over $600,000)

Most middle-class taxpayers would land in the 12 percent bracket; upper-middle-class households go from the 25 percent bracket to 22 percent, or from 33 percent to 24 percent, or from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. Families will also be able to benefit from a slightly expanded child tax credit.

According to an analysis from the Tax Policy Center, the bill would reduce taxes for Americans in all income groups in 2018 — increasing after-tax income by an average of 2.2 percent.

But as time goes on, all this changes.

Loser: individual taxpayers — in the long term

The tax cut for individuals will slowly decrease over time — and end altogether in 2025.

As Matthews explains, the thresholds for individual tax brackets are adjusted according to chained CPI, a lower measure of inflation than standard CPI, which is used currently. This will increase tax revenue over time by pushing people into higher tax brackets.

Then in 2025, the individual tax relief in the Republican tax bill expires altogether. This is due to a Senate budget rule that restricts the cost of the tax bill to $1.5 trillion. Republicans decided to sunset nearly all the individual tax cuts in order to make the corporate tax cuts permanent.

The result will be a tax increase in 2027 for more than half of all Americans — 53 percent, according to an analysis from the Tax Policy Center.

Loser: fiscal conservatism

The corporate tax cut, along with the bill’s other tax cuts, is expensive. The tax bill costs $1.46 trillion over 10 years — or roughly $1 trillion when adjusted for economic growth. Either way, it’s a substantial impact on the deficit.

You’d expect conservatives who have spent their careers decrying the dangers of the national debt to shudder at such an estimate. But not so much.

Fiscal conservatives and deficit hawks seem to have changed their tune, all in the name of massive tax cuts that would primarily benefit the wealthy.

“Sometimes you have to go into a little bit of debt to make your business stronger,” Rep. Jim Renacci (R-OH) said when the House was passing the budget, which gave Republicans a green light to go ahead with a partisan tax bill.

In their budget reconciliation instructions, Republicans allow for this bill to carve a $1.5 trillion hole in the deficit over the first 10 years. Due to Senate rules, the bill ultimately cannot increase the deficit any more after the 10-year mark. To meet this requirement, Republicans end almost all the individual tax cuts in 2025, and make the corporate tax cuts permanent.

But House Speaker Paul Ryan says Republicans have every “intent” to renew the individual tax cuts in 2025, to ensure taxes don’t go up for individual Americans. It’s up to whoever sits in Congress in the future.

If Congress does in fact renew the individual tax cuts, the actual impact on the deficit would be much greater than the current estimates. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that expiring the individual tax cuts in the bill hides between $570 billion and $725 billion of potential costs. In other words, the bill could actually increase the deficit by $2 trillion to $2.2 trillion.

Republicans continue to insist that their tax bill will lead to unprecedented economic growth to make up for these costs, but there’s some dubious math that goes into that expectation, including a very rosy calculation for economic growth. The Treasury Department even included legislation that hasn’t even been introduced — like an infrastructure bill — in its analysis of the tax bill’s impact on economic growth.

Loser: Blue states

Twelve Republicans voted against the final tax bill in the House. Eleven of those 12 were Republicans from New York, New Jersey, and California — high-tax blue states that are disproportionately disadvantaged by this tax bill.

The defections stem from two major changes to the tax code, meant to help offset the cost of a massive tax break for corporations.

The bill changes the mortgage interest deduction, lowering the cap for newly issued loans to $750,000 from the current $1 million threshold. Those in the real estate industry say this would reduce the incentive to buy and build homes, which could affect lenders, construction companies, and real estate firms. It also disproportionately impacts states with higher home prices, like California, New York, and New Jersey.

Americans in Democratic-leaning states, which typically have higher income and property taxes, are also adversely affected by this bill’s new $10,000 cap on the state and local income and property tax deduction.

Republicans in support of the bill say neither of these changes will impact Americans because of the increased standard deduction, as people are less likely to itemize their deductions — but it was enough to lose the votes of 11 blue-state Republicans.

Winner: Tax accountants

Trump has often invoked tax accountants when pitching the tax bill to the American public.

Promising a tax code that “simple and easy to understand” at a rally earlier this year, Trump said: “Sorry. H&R Block will not be supporting Donald Trump, I can tell you,” insinuating that the new simplified tax code would put tax accountants like H&R Block out of work. H&R Block’s stock dropped this fall, some of which was associated with the anticipation of a Republican tax reform bill.

But tax accountants can rest assured: They will still have jobs.

Republicans passed a tax bill that does very little to actually simplify the tax code. Despite early efforts from the House, which passed a version of the tax bill that condensed the current seven tax brackets to four and cut many of the deductions — like those for teachers’ supplies and high medical expenses — the final draft of the tax bill does no such thing.

“Provides support for graduate students by continuing to exempt the value of reduced tuition from taxes,” the talking points stated. “Continues to and expands the deduction for charitable contributions ... preserving the Adoption Tax Credit ... preserving the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit.”

It’s a sudden reversal of what has been a decades-long campaign to simplify the tax code, and a promise that Americans could soon fill out their taxes on a postcard.

Loser: Obamacare marketplaces

The tax bill isn’t just a tax bill. It’s also a health care bill.

Republicans have agreed to repeal the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate, which taxes Americans who don’t purchase health insurance. Republicans are calling it a blow to the “heart” of Obamacare, which they failed to repeal earlier this year.

The impact of repealing the individual mandate could be serious. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that it could leave as many as 13 million fewer insured over the next 10 years, and increase premiums by an average 10 percent over the next decade.

Big companies drove Donald Trump’s tax cut law but refused to commit to any specific wage hikes for workers, despite repeated White House promises it would help employees, an investigation shows.

The 2017 Tax and Jobs Act – the Trump administration’s one major piece of enacted legislation – did deliver the biggest corporate tax cut in US history, but ultimately workers benefited almost not at all.

This is one of the conclusions of a six-month investigation into the process that led to the tax cut by the Center for Public Integrity, a not-for-profit news agency based in Washington DC.

The full findings, based on interviews with three dozen key players and independent tax experts, and analysis of hundreds of pages of government documents, are published today in an in-depth piece.

‘Just 6% spent on workers’

The tax hike was sold to citizens as a move that would boost the economy, add jobs and hike wages. The president said in one speech that it would bring the average American household “around a $4,000 pay raise”.

Seizing on that, the Communications Workers of America, a 700,000-member union, asked eight major corporations to sign a pledge to hike worker wages by $4,000 a year if their tax rate was cut to 20%, the initial proposed rate. The companies balked and signed nothing.

Still, big business got what it wanted.

The bill signed into law by Trump on 22 December 2017 cut the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21%, the largest such rate cut in US history. “The most excited group out there are big CEOs,” said the White House economic adviser Gary Cohn as the measure was making its way through Congress in 2017.

But the fears of ordinary workers in regard to those promised higher wages were realized.

The bulk of the $150bn the tax cut put into the hands of corporations in 2018 went into shareholder dividends and stock buy-backs, both of which line the pockets of the 10% of Americans who own 84% of the stocks.

Just 6% of the tax savings was spent on workers, according to Just Capital, a not-for-profit that tracks the Russell 1000 index.

In the first three months after the bill passed, the average weekly paycheck rose by $6.21. That would be $233 a year.

One retirement expert, J Mark Iwry, said more of the cut should be reaching workers: “It would seem appropriate for employers to share their tax savings with their workers – for example, through new employer 401k plan contributions or wage increases.”

Among the investigation’s other key takeaways:

During the process deficit hawks who opposed adding any more to the existing $20tn in US debt, and who insisted on any tax cut having “revenue neutrality”, hemmed and hawed and finally folded, as one commentator put it, “like a cheap suit”. Still, some Republicans used $1.5tn in accounting devices to either hide the true cost of the bill or help justify their votes.

One idea on the table for nearly six months was a so-called Border Adjustment Tax, which would have raised $1tn and largely paid for the tax cuts. But members of the Senate belittled it, saying it would never fly because it was opposed by a coalition of huge retailers. They were right. But when the border tax was abandoned, Congress had no plan B to offset the huge tax cuts.

The bill was drafted in secret, partly to keep it from Congress’s own members who, it was feared, would leak it to lobbyists. Those crafting the bill worried that if the contents of their drafts leaked out, lobbyists would go to work gutting the bill. Hearings on the legislation were reduced to a bare minimum.

Limited scrutiny

The bill was passed with astonishing speed that limited scrutiny. The Joint Committee on Taxation, a trusted nonpartisan agency that tried to give an honest assessment of the cost of the bill, was virtually cut from the picture. Its final and most important assessment was not delivered until the day Trump signed the bill. Not a single member of Congress saw that analysis before voting.

In a meeting that was the key turning point in the entire process, the Senate’s most vocal deficit hawk, Republican Bob Corker of Tennessee, who wanted to create no new debt, sat down with the Senate’s most strident supply-sider, Republican Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, who wanted to borrow $2.5tn to pay for the tax cuts. They agreed on borrowing $1.5tn over 10 years. The meeting lasted all of 10 minutes.

Ultimately, three main themes emerged from the Center’s reporting.

One is that the bill, with its 21% corporate tax rate, was first and foremost a gift to multinationals. They had wanted cuts in the corporate tax rate for foreign and domestic profits for decades. Everything else flowed from that: the tax cuts for smaller businesses known as “pass-throughs”, which had been their holy grail, and the cuts for individuals, which were needed to sell the bill to voters.

The second: all the posturing about real “reform” of the tax code and “revenue neutrality” for the legislation was meaningless. In fact, the bill had to create a $1.5tn 10-year deficit to pay for its generous tax cuts. Without the deficit, the corporate rate of 21% could never have been achieved and, more important, the bill could not have passed at all.

The third was that the bill as passed was hugely problematic. It contained egregious mistakes, created massive new loopholes and opened the door to new forms of tax avoidance. Thirteen tax law professors from around the country, in a 68-page study, blasted its “rushed and secretive process” that resulted, they said, “in deeply flawed legislation”.

More Republicans call for increased tax revenue in a deficit deal

More and more , conservative Republicans in Congress are breaking from a pledge they signed years earlier against any kind of tax increase or additional tax revenue .
Facing the so-called fiscal cliff of automatic tax hikes and deep across-the-board spending cuts at the end of the year , the GOP legislators are signaling their willingness to cut a deal with President Barack Obama and Democrats that would include more money for the government .
The overall numbers remain relatively small -- a handful of senators and House members -- but they include influential veterans such as Sens . Saxby Chambliss of Georgia and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina , along with Rep. Peter King of New York .
King has `` tried to weasel out '' of the pledge , anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist told CNN 's Piers Morgan on Monday . `` I hope his wife understands commitments last a little longer than two years or something . ''

However , the government and Congress still would have time to prevent draconian effects from the fiscal cliff when a new Congress convenes in January .

`` To be sure , no one believes that non-agreement by December 31 would be the end of the story .

''
Long a defining difference between Democrats and Republicans , the tax issue has stymied efforts to work out a deficit deal for the past two years .
Obama and House Speaker John Boehner came close to agreement last year before conservative rejection of any increased revenue and liberal resistance to entitlement reform scuttled the effort .
Boehner , the Ohio Republican who has emerged as party leader in the deficit talks , agrees to the concept of increased revenue , though he and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky both remain opposed to actually raising tax rates .
Instead , they propose broad tax reform that will lower rates while eliminating unspecified loopholes and exemptions to spur economic growth that they say will result in more overall government revenue .
`` It 's fair to ask my party to put revenue on the table . We 're below historic averages , '' Graham told ABC . `` I will not raise tax rates to do it . I will cap deductions . If you cap deductions around the $ 30,000 , $ 40,000 range , you can raise $ 1 trillion in revenue , and the people who lose their deductions are the upper-income Americans . ''
At the same time , Graham and other conservative lawmakers demand that Democrats agree to significant reforms in entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid , the government-run health care programs for senior citizens , the disabled and the poor .
`` I will violate the pledge , long story short , for the good of the country , only if Democrats will do entitlement reform , '' Graham said .
On the same program , Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois said some changes to Medicare are needed , but he ruled out any reforms to Social Security , the national retirement plan , saying it is a separately funded system that `` does not add a penny to our debt . ''
Noting opposition to entitlement reforms by traditional Democratic allies such as organized labor , Durbin said everyone has to realize that some changes are needed in Medicare and Medicaid .
`` Those who say 'do n't touch it , do n't change it ' are ignoring the obvious , '' said the Senate 's No . 2 Democrat , adding that `` we can make meaningful reforms in Medicare and Medicaid without compromising the integrity of the program , making sure that the beneficiaries are not paying the price for it , except perhaps the high-income beneficiaries . That to me is a reasonable approach . ''
However , Durbin balked at one proposal sought by Republicans -- to slowly raise the eligibility age for Medicare above the current level of 65 .
`` What happens to the early retiree who needs health insurance before that person 's eligible for Medicare ? '' Durbin asked . `` My concern about raising that Medicare retirement age is there will be gaps in coverage or coverage that 's way too expensive for seniors to purchase . ''
Graham rejected Durbin 's point , saying the same change instituted in Social Security has worked . He also called for adjusting benefits based on the personal wealth of recipients , so that those with more money have to pay more for services .
Norquist said Democrats will never agree to the negotiating position of Graham and other Republicans , calling the demand for entitlement reforms akin to a `` pink unicorn that does n't exist . ''
The political risk for Republicans to going against the no-tax pledge comes from angering Norquist and other conservatives who can target them in GOP primary campaigns in 2014 and beyond .

More Republicans call for increased tax revenue in a deficit deal

President Obama and Congress are trying to work out an agreement

But ... your email?

A California official is bringing new life to the argument that the Internet -- including emails -- is an untapped revenue resource that should be taxed to help local economies.

Berkeley City Councilman Gordon Wozniak brought up taxing emails during a recent council meeting. He suggested the money collected, which would be part of a wider-reaching Internet tax, could be used in Berkeley's case to save the local post office.

""There should be something like a bit tax,"" he said during the March 5 meeting. ""I mean, a bit tax could be a cent per gigabit and they would make, probably, billions of dollars a year.""

Plus, he said, there should be a ""very tiny tax on email.""

This idea goes beyond already-controversial proposals to tax e-commerce -- like buying used books on Amazon. This would be a tax on data.

Wozniak told FoxNews.com the response to the idea has been varied.

""Most people don't like the idea of taxing the Internet,"" he acknowledged. ""There are a number of people who say it's a good idea, but some are saying it's impractical and there's no way to do it.""

Chris Edwards, an economist with the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, is one of those people.

""It's a terrible idea,"" Edwards told FoxNews.com.

""The government doesn't need any more tax money. That's not the problem. The American government is spending more than ever.""

Plus, he said, a tax like this would hit ""different types of industry in different ways.""

Local governments can't legally impose a tax on the Internet -- but Wozniak's idea is not as new, or perhaps as far-fetched, as it sounds. Amid concerns that the government could one day turn to the Internet for a new-age funding stream, Congress in 1998 passed a law called the Internet Tax Freedom Act, which bans Internet taxation.

That law is set to expire next November. If that happens, Wozniak's proposal could someday turn into a reality -- but the likelihood is slim.

Republican Sens. Kelly Ayotte and Dean Heller have already introduced legislation this year that would indefinitely extend the law prohibiting federal, state and local governments from taxing Internet access.

The idea of a ""bit tax"" is the brainchild of Arthur Cordell, a former information technology adviser for the Canadian government. Cordell proposed the tax during a 1997 lecture at Harvard Law School.

""While there are few kudos for proposing a new tax, the time is ripe to suggest positive and constructive ways of dealing with serious fiscal realities,"" Cordell said at the time. ""The move to a new economy should be matched by consideration of a new tax base. A tax base that is growing. A tax base that is at the heart of a new economy. A tax base that can be easily identified, one where collection is in few hands. A tax that is difficult to avoid.""

He, too, called it a ""bit tax.""

Cordell did not return a request for comment from FoxNews.com. But he did tell a Los Angeles Times columnist this month that he still supports the Internet tax, saying, ""it's needed more than ever as we get rid of brick and mortar stuff. ... eventually it's going to happen.""

The idea seemed to get an endorsement from the LA Times columnist, George Skelton, who suggested such a tax could even cut down on ""spammers and scammers."" Skelton suggested emails that run off the screen be taxed an additional amount, ""just as a bulky letter costs more than a 46-cent stamp.""

Under Cordell's framework, the bit tax would impose a levy on each digital bit of information flowing through global networks. That means people could have to pony up a fee for emails, file transfers, electronic check transactions and more.

And that could be just the beginning.

Cordell said in 1997 that the new revenue could be used for schools, parks and health care, among other services. Critics of this idea, he argued, are interested in trying to ""wrestle the state to the ground."" At the time, he quoted U.S. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., ""who wrote in a decision in 1904 that 'Taxes are what we pay for civilized society.'""

Edwards disagrees.

taxes,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/28/donald-trump-rolls-out-proposal-simplify-tax-code-/,"Donald Trump rolls out proposal to simplify tax code, cut taxes for millions",2015-09-28,Seth Mclaughlin,"Presidential hopeful Donald Trump said he would lower tax rates and slim the federal tax code , cutting millions of people out of any income tax liability at all as he unveiled his plan Monday , joining a growing list of Republicans pushing for a scaled-down , simpler system .
He said he would ax many of the breaks that the wealthy and upper middle class use to avoid paying higher taxes , though he would preserve the charitable and mortgage interest deductions .
The billionaire businessman said some of his wealthy pals wouldn ’ t be happy with those trims , but he expects his top-tier tax rate of 25 percent , down from the current 39.5 percent , would leave many of them better off anyway . He also proposed cutting the corporate tax rate to 15 percent .
“ It ’ ll simplify the tax code , it ’ ll grow the American economy at a level that it hasn ’ t seen for decades . And all of this does not add to our debt or our deficit , ” the 69-year-old said .
Budget analysts questioned Mr. Trump ’ s math , saying he would be hard-pressed to replace the trillions of dollars in revenue lost under his plan .
Kyle E. Pomerleau of the Tax Foundation said Mr. Trump ’ s plan is “ very similar to Jeb Bush ’ s tax plan , except it will end up being a much larger tax cut . ”
“ His claims that it is going to be revenue-neutral is probably not accurate . The initial tax cut is so big that it would not be revenue-neutral even with greater revenue growth , ” Mr. Pomerleau said .
Earlier this month , former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush proposed his own overhaul that a Tax Foundation analysis said would cut taxes by $ 3.6 trillion and reduce federal revenue by $ 1.6 trillion over the next decade , raising questions about what programs Mr. Bush would cut to offset the revenue loss .
For Mr. Trump , the Republican presidential front-runner , it ’ s his third major policy statement — after an immigration plan and a set of principles on Second Amendment rights — and it puts him in the conversation that is raging within the campaign field .
Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky , another Republican White House hopeful , captured the sentiment of many grass-roots activists when he videotaped himself at a rifle range shooting up a box filled with tax code volumes . The footage served as a sequel to a video he released a couple of months earlier in which he put the tax code into a wood chipper , chopped it up with a chain saw and lit it on fire .
Despite the mounting aggravation among voters , however , efforts to reshape the tax system have stalled on Capitol Hill , forcing the conversation into the presidential race .
Mr. Trump predicted his plan could send the nation ’ s gross domestic product growth to as high as 6 percent a year , which is more than twice the current projections for 2017-2020 , the period that would cover the next administration .
“ We ’ re going to have growth that will be tremendous , ” Mr. Trump said .
“ One of the things that Trump needs to think about is that his plan is going to be a very substantial cut in the amount of revenue the government raises . So , either he has to scale back a bit or think of the cuts he needs to make to make this revenue-neutral , ” he said .
“ We are reducing taxes , but at the same time , if I win , if I become president , we will be able to cut so much money and have a better country , ” he said . “ We won ’ t be losing anything other than we will be balancing budgets and getting them where they should be . ”
Mr. Paul and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida also have put forward tax fixes and share some ideas with Mr. Trump and Mr. Bush .
The four rivals are calling for condensing tax brackets , as well as reducing marginal income tax rates and ending the “ death tax ” and alternative minimum tax .
Mr. Trump , however , is not pushing for the sort of territorial tax system or for allowing businesses to deduct capital investments that Mr. Bush , Mr. Rubio and Mr. Paul are advocating .
Mr. Trump would compress the existing seven tax brackets to four , with the top bracket — individuals making more than $ 150,000 and couples making more than $ 300,000 — facing a 25 percent taxation rate .
Individuals making less than $ 25,000 per year and families making less than $ 50,000 per year would be in the 0 percent bracket , meaning they would pay nothing in income tax , though he said they would still have to file a one-page return with the IRS that says , “ I win . ”

His plan sets the standard deduction at $ 15,000 per filer , according to the Tax Foundation .","Presidential hopeful Donald Trump said he would lower tax rates and slim the federal tax code, cutting millions of people out of any income tax liability at all as he unveiled his plan Monday, joining a growing list of Republicans pushing for a scaled-down, simpler system.

He said he would ax many of the breaks that the wealthy and upper middle class use to avoid paying higher taxes, though he would preserve the charitable and mortgage interest deductions.

The billionaire businessman said some of his wealthy pals wouldn’t be happy with those trims, but he expects his top-tier tax rate of 25 percent, down from the current 39.5 percent, would leave many of them better off anyway. He also proposed cutting the corporate tax rate to 15 percent.

“It’ll simplify the tax code, it’ll grow the American economy at a level that it hasn’t seen for decades. And all of this does not add to our debt or our deficit,” the 69-year-old said.

Budget analysts questioned Mr. Trump’s math, saying he would be hard-pressed to replace the trillions of dollars in revenue lost under his plan.

Kyle E. Pomerleau of the Tax Foundation said Mr. Trump’s plan is “very similar to Jeb Bush’s tax plan, except it will end up being a much larger tax cut.”

“His claims that it is going to be revenue-neutral is probably not accurate. The initial tax cut is so big that it would not be revenue-neutral even with greater revenue growth,” Mr. Pomerleau said.

Earlier this month, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush proposed his own overhaul that a Tax Foundation analysis said would cut taxes by $3.6 trillion and reduce federal revenue by $1.6 trillion over the next decade, raising questions about what programs Mr. Bush would cut to offset the revenue loss.

For Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential front-runner, it’s his third major policy statement — after an immigration plan and a set of principles on Second Amendment rights — and it puts him in the conversation that is raging within the campaign field.

Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, another Republican White House hopeful, captured the sentiment of many grass-roots activists when he videotaped himself at a rifle range shooting up a box filled with tax code volumes. The footage served as a sequel to a video he released a couple of months earlier in which he put the tax code into a wood chipper, chopped it up with a chain saw and lit it on fire.

Despite the mounting aggravation among voters, however, efforts to reshape the tax system have stalled on Capitol Hill, forcing the conversation into the presidential race.

Mr. Trump predicted his plan could send the nation’s gross domestic product growth to as high as 6 percent a year, which is more than twice the current projections for 2017-2020, the period that would cover the next administration.

“We’re going to have growth that will be tremendous,” Mr. Trump said.

Mr. Pomerleau, though, said something’s got to give.

“One of the things that Trump needs to think about is that his plan is going to be a very substantial cut in the amount of revenue the government raises. So, either he has to scale back a bit or think of the cuts he needs to make to make this revenue-neutral,” he said.

Mr. Trump sounded confident about his cost-cutting abilities.

“We are reducing taxes, but at the same time, if I win, if I become president, we will be able to cut so much money and have a better country,” he said. “We won’t be losing anything other than we will be balancing budgets and getting them where they should be.”

Mr. Paul and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida also have put forward tax fixes and share some ideas with Mr. Trump and Mr. Bush.

The four rivals are calling for condensing tax brackets, as well as reducing marginal income tax rates and ending the “death tax” and alternative minimum tax.

Mr. Trump, however, is not pushing for the sort of territorial tax system or for allowing businesses to deduct capital investments that Mr. Bush, Mr. Rubio and Mr. Paul are advocating.

Mr. Trump would compress the existing seven tax brackets to four, with the top bracket — individuals making more than $150,000 and couples making more than $300,000 — facing a 25 percent taxation rate.

Individuals making less than $25,000 per year and families making less than $50,000 per year would be in the 0 percent bracket, meaning they would pay nothing in income tax, though he said they would still have to file a one-page return with the IRS that says, “I win.”

Those in the lowest bracket would also pay no taxes on long-term capital gains or dividends, while those in the top bracket would pay a 20 percent rate on that kind of investment income.

Mr. Trump’s plan cuts the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent and gives businesses the chance to repatriate their overseas earnings by paying a one-time 10 percent levy.

It also would stop special treatment for carried interest, which taxes hedge fund managers’ income at the lower investment rates rather than the salary and wage rates most Americans pay.

Mr. Bush’s plan calls for three tax brackets — 10 percent, 25 percent and 28 percent, with the top marginal rate applying to individuals making $85,750 or more and $142,200 for joint filers.

Mr. Bush also wants to eliminate certain loopholes and would cap the total number of tax deductions — with the exception of charitable donations — that can be claimed at 2 percent of a filer’s income.

He wants to reduce the top corporate tax rate to 20 percent and tax capital gains and dividends at a top marginal rate of 20 percent.

Mr. Rubio’s proposal would establish two brackets — 15 percent and 25 percent, with the top rate applying to individuals who make more than $75,000, and $150,000 for joint filers.

The freshman lawmaker called for the top corporate rate to be dropped to 25 percent and for capital gains and dividends income to be tax-free.

Mr. Paul wants to set a 14.5 percent flat rate on businesses and on individuals, as well as on capital gains and dividends income.

His plan sets the standard deduction at $15,000 per filer, according to the Tax Foundation.

Conservatives say their problem is about messaging . They say they simply have to do more to deliver the news about the tax bill and its benefits .

The CNBC poll wasn ’ t the first one to show few employed people reporting seeing paycheck boosts due to the tax law . A Politico–Morning Consult poll conducted in mid-February found that 37 percent of employed voters noticed more take-home pay , while 53 percent hadn ’ t .
And more generally , the GOP is already facing stiff headwinds .
A CNN poll released this week found Democratic voters enjoy a significant enthusiasm gap over Republican voters — although the poll also saw Democrats ’ advantage on the generic House ballot narrowing .
Tax experts said there are a number of reasons why people might not be reporting seeing an increase in their take-home pay .
One reason is that many taxpayers won ’ t end up receiving a particularly large tax cut , especially if the benefit is spread out over the course of the year .
For example , the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center has estimated that people with incomes between $ 48,600 and $ 86,100 will , on average , receive a tax cut of $ 930 for 2018 , which is around $ 35 per pay period if divided equally among 26 pay periods . The group said that people with income of below $ 25,000 will , on average , get a tax cut of only $ 60 over the course of the whole year .
“ The tax bill just doesn ’ t provide much benefit to most people , ” said Vanessa Williamson , a fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution .
The CNBC survey seemed to confirm that result . It showed that people with higher incomes were more likely to notice an increase in take-home pay than low-income individuals — an outcome that Democrats could use against the GOP in their midterm campaign .
Another reason why people may not be reporting seeing paycheck boosts is that some of the benefits of the new tax law , such as the larger child tax credit , aren ’ t reflected in the new withholding tables .
“ There are benefits of tax reform that aren ’ t necessarily reflected in the new withholding tables , and this is the last year Americans will have to file their taxes under the old code , ” said Julia Slingsby , a spokeswoman for House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady Kevin Patrick BradyDemocratic chairman proposes new fix for surprise medical bills Nancy Pelosi is ready for this fight Impeachment push threatens to derail bipartisan efforts on health care costs MORE ( R-Texas . ) .
Experts also said that there are other reasons why people may see changes in their paychecks besides the tax cuts , such as larger 401 ( k ) contributions or health insurance premiums .
“ There ’ s just a lot of moving parts to people ’ s take-home pay , ” said Gordon Gray , director of fiscal policy at American Action Forum .
The GOP must also contend with people ’ s pre-existing political views , which color their perception of whether the tax plan has affected their income for the better .
Among the employed adults in the survey , Trump voters were more than twice as likely to say they had more take-home pay as a result of lower federal taxes ( 48 percent ) than people who voted for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonDemocrat running for Hurd 's seat in Texas raises M in third quarter Ex-police chief charged with hate crime called Trump 'last hope for white people ' Brent Budowsky : Deep Throat 's defending our democracy MORE ( 22 percent ) . Nearly twice as many Clinton voters said they didn ’ t see a wage bump in comparison to Trump voters ( 62 percent to 35 percent , respectively ) .
That could indicate that Republicans will have a hard time reaching Clinton voters , even if their paychecks are increasing as a result of the tax overhaul .
Still , polls have shown that support for the tax law has increased since its enactment as companies have announced wage increases , bonuses and new benefits following the law ’ s passage . According to GOP internal polling , the tax law has a positive image in competitive House districts .
“ The Republican-led tax reform plan becomes more popular by the day as people learn about the positive effect it has had on their paychecks , family budgets and our thriving economy , ” said Jesse Hunt , a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee .
Only a small subset of adults surveyed by CNBC said that they saw their paychecks go up and it was significantly beneficial .
Of those surveyed in the CNBC poll , only 60 percent were employed to begin with . Among those , only 32 percent said that they noticed their income go up as a result of tax changes .
Breaking that group down further , just 38 percent thought the amount their wages went up helped a fair amount or a great deal . That means only 12 percent of employed adults thought the tax plan helped them in a significant way , which amounts to only 7.2 percent of the overall sample .
The poll comes after employers were supposed to have adopted guidance from the IRS that adjusted the amounts withheld from people ’ s paychecks for federal taxes in light of the new law .
The withholding guidance took into account three key parts of the tax law : the lower rates , larger standard deduction and repeal of personal exemptions .

Conservatives said that GOP lawmakers should do more to highlight the tax law ’ s benefits .
“ The amplification needs to go up . If a congressman is only talking about it once a week , he needs to talk about it twice a week , ” said Ryan Ellis , senior tax adviser for the Family Business Coalition .
The Republican National Committee is planning a `` week of action '' during the week of the April 17 filing deadline to tout the benefits of the new law , according to a spokeswoman .
One bright point for Republicans in the CNBC poll is that , despite many people brushing aside the tax bill 's positive effect on their income , a large number maintained an overall positive outlook about their wages .
Of the 60 percent of respondents that were currently employed , 41 percent said they expect their wages to increase in the next year — a moderately high level by historical standards .
And the good economic news keeps on coming . On Thursday , the Labor Department announced that jobless claims have fallen to their lowest level since 1973 .
Focusing on overall economic satisfaction could be a winning approach for Republicans , even if people aren ’ t feeling a big effect from the tax cuts .
“ People are always skeptical about their getting higher pay and tax or other benefits , ” says pollster Mark Penn , a former strategist for President Clinton .
“ The key point is how are they feeling about the overall economy . A party should never run on tax cuts but on economic performance , employment and wage gains . Tax cuts by themselves would not be a winning message , ” he added .","More than three months after the passage of the GOP’s tax-cut law, new surveys suggest that many people don’t think they are getting bigger paychecks, which could cut into support for Republicans in this fall’s midterm elections.

Another reason why people may not be reporting seeing paycheck boosts is that some of the benefits of the new tax law, such as the larger child tax credit, aren’t reflected in the new withholding tables.

“There are benefits of tax reform that aren’t necessarily reflected in the new withholding tables, and this is the last year Americans will have to file their taxes under the old code,” said Julia Slingsby, a spokeswoman for House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady Kevin Patrick BradyDemocratic chairman proposes new fix for surprise medical bills Nancy Pelosi is ready for this fight Impeachment push threatens to derail bipartisan efforts on health care costs MORE (R-Texas.).

Experts also said that there are other reasons why people may see changes in their paychecks besides the tax cuts, such as larger 401(k) contributions or health insurance premiums.

“There’s just a lot of moving parts to people’s take-home pay,” said Gordon Gray, director of fiscal policy at American Action Forum.

The GOP must also contend with people’s pre-existing political views, which color their perception of whether the tax plan has affected their income for the better.

Among the employed adults in the survey, Trump voters were more than twice as likely to say they had more take-home pay as a result of lower federal taxes (48 percent) than people who voted for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonDemocrat running for Hurd's seat in Texas raises M in third quarter Ex-police chief charged with hate crime called Trump 'last hope for white people' Brent Budowsky: Deep Throat's defending our democracy MORE (22 percent). Nearly twice as many Clinton voters said they didn’t see a wage bump in comparison to Trump voters (62 percent to 35 percent, respectively).

That could indicate that Republicans will have a hard time reaching Clinton voters, even if their paychecks are increasing as a result of the tax overhaul.

Still, polls have shown that support for the tax law has increased since its enactment as companies have announced wage increases, bonuses and new benefits following the law’s passage. According to GOP internal polling, the tax law has a positive image in competitive House districts.

“The Republican-led tax reform plan becomes more popular by the day as people learn about the positive effect it has had on their paychecks, family budgets and our thriving economy,” said Jesse Hunt, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee.

Only a small subset of adults surveyed by CNBC said that they saw their paychecks go up and it was significantly beneficial.

Of those surveyed in the CNBC poll, only 60 percent were employed to begin with. Among those, only 32 percent said that they noticed their income go up as a result of tax changes.

Breaking that group down further, just 38 percent thought the amount their wages went up helped a fair amount or a great deal. That means only 12 percent of employed adults thought the tax plan helped them in a significant way, which amounts to only 7.2 percent of the overall sample.

The poll comes after employers were supposed to have adopted guidance from the IRS that adjusted the amounts withheld from people’s paychecks for federal taxes in light of the new law.

The withholding guidance took into account three key parts of the tax law: the lower rates, larger standard deduction and repeal of personal exemptions. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Steven Terner MnuchinHillicon Valley: Treasury sanctions Russians over 2018 election meddling | How Facebook fought back on FTC fine | WeWork calls off IPO | Elon Musk unveils Mars rocket US sanctions Russian individuals for interference in 2018 elections Trump seeks to shift questions from impeachment at UN MORE said that 90 percent of wage earners would see more take-home pay due to the guidance.

Conservatives said that GOP lawmakers should do more to highlight the tax law’s benefits.

“The amplification needs to go up. If a congressman is only talking about it once a week, he needs to talk about it twice a week,” said Ryan Ellis, senior tax adviser for the Family Business Coalition.

The Republican National Committee is planning a ""week of action"" during the week of the April 17 filing deadline to tout the benefits of the new law, according to a spokeswoman.

One bright point for Republicans in the CNBC poll is that, despite many people brushing aside the tax bill's positive effect on their income, a large number maintained an overall positive outlook about their wages.

Of the 60 percent of respondents that were currently employed, 41 percent said they expect their wages to increase in the next year — a moderately high level by historical standards.

And the good economic news keeps on coming. On Thursday, the Labor Department announced that jobless claims have fallen to their lowest level since 1973.

Focusing on overall economic satisfaction could be a winning approach for Republicans, even if people aren’t feeling a big effect from the tax cuts.

“People are always skeptical about their getting higher pay and tax or other benefits,” says pollster Mark Penn, a former strategist for President Clinton.

“The key point is how are they feeling about the overall economy. A party should never run on tax cuts but on economic performance, employment and wage gains. Tax cuts by themselves would not be a winning message,” he added.",www.thehill.com,center,yldSxQ3Vyzd0pAom

The vote was 53-40, with 60 needed to advance the measure.

The dispute come just days after a similar impasse scuttled an energy efficiency bill and a vote on the Keystone Pipeline — presaging six more months of gridlock and partisan bickering if Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell cannot forge a working relationship before the November election.

Lawmakers said they did not know what happen next with the so-called tax extenders, which would renew a hodgepodge of temporary provisions benefiting teachers, commuters, banks and others that are usually rolled over by Congress with minimal drama.

Some Republicans said they hoped the delay would be brief, though the party’s top tax writer acknowledged the move could kill the legislation until after this year’s midterm elections. That’s an unfortunate risk, said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), but it’s more important for Republicans to stand up for their rights.

“Don’t we care a little more about freedom and the right to bring up your amendments and the right to be a participant in the process?” said Hatch. “We’ve always had rights around here and that’s what’s involved here, that’s what the whole thing is about. It’s not about trying to stop this bill — it’s saying, ‘Look, we’ve had enough of this crap.”

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) lambasted Republicans over the vote.

“Republicans can’t take ‘yes’ for an answer — they just voted against the second bipartisan bill in less than a week,” he said. “That’s what just happened: the Republicans voted against tax cuts. So maybe the Republicans will hear from their friends down on K Street and around the country and maybe they will learn this is pretty important to everybody.”

Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois was the only Republican to side with Democrats.

Lawmakers will take the weekend and the first couple of days of next week to see if an amendment deal can be worked out, aides in both parties said. Hatch said his side will continue to push for a vote to block the medical device tax, which Republicans complain Democrats will not allow though it enjoys broad bipartisan support.

“I’m not giving up on that,” said Hatch.

The GOP leadership first began whipping their members to vote down the bill on Wednesday – and by a Thursday caucus lunch Republicans had agreed to take a stand against Reid. Republicans said they did not feel conflicting about shooting down a tax cut bill.

“Tax cuts come and go,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). “I want to be able to vote on this bill but I’d also like to be able to vote on repealing the medical device tax.” Said Minority Whip John Cornyn: “Republicans are outraged that we’ve basically been frozen out of the process.”

Matt Drudge sounded the siren earlier this week when he tweeted that “ [ the ] Republican party should be sued for fraud . NO discussion of tax cuts now . Just lots of crazy . Back to basics , guys ! ”
Republican party should be sued for fraud . NO discussion of tax cuts now . Just lots of crazy . Back to basics , guys ! pic.twitter.com/5uHIg8klq6 — MATT DRUDGE ( @ DRUDGE ) February 8 , 2017
Drudge 's tweet garnered a mixed response on Twitter , with some apparent Trump supporters echoing the call and others urging the public to give GOP leaders a chance to deliver on their agenda .
@ DRUDGE We need those tax cuts ! ! A lot of people were excited about them . Never grow the economy w/o tax cuts & regulations roll-back . — Pro-Lifer For Trump ( @ MyPresidentme ) February 8 , 2017
@ DRUDGE kind of impatient ? ? Only week 3 . Still trying to get cabinet confirmed . Never heard promise by Feb 8th . — Boleslaw The Brave ( @ boleslawthebrav ) February 8 , 2017
The fedora-donning Drudge Report founder 's complaint speaks to a deep and long-standing suspicion from the Republican base about so-called “ establishment ” lawmakers stopping short of pursuing big changes -- on entitlements , taxes and more .
While the Trump White House has moved at a furious pace to sign executive orders dealing with immigration , jobs and law enforcement -- and Congress has moved to roll back several Obama-era regulations -- some have voiced concern that both the push to replace ObamaCare and to overhaul the tax code are losing steam .
███ host Sean Hannity directed criticism Thursday night mostly at GOP leaders on Capitol Hill , contrasting Congress ' slow pace with Trump 's rapid-fire executive orders .
“ Delaying these tax cuts means delaying the ability for tens of millions of Americans to fulfill the promise of the American Dream , ” he said .
`` I 'm putting the GOP on notice , '' Hannity said . `` No more excuses . No more explanations . Go to work , roll up your sleeves , and do your job . ''
Trump , for his part , appears keen on advancing a plan . In a meeting with airline executives Thursday , Trump promised a “ phenomenal ” tax plan .
“ We 're going to be announcing something , I would say over the next two or three weeks , that will be phenomenal in terms of tax and developing our aviation infrastructure , '' he teased .
The Wall Street Journal reported that while White House officials have been discussing tax issues with House and Senate Republicans , Trump 's announcement caught GOP officials by surprise . House Speaker Paul Ryan told ███ last week that tax reform was eyed for the spring , after an ObamaCare repeal .
`` You ca n't do them both at the same time because of how the budget system works , '' he said . House Republicans are working on a plan , but have not formally introduced a bill .
However , a number of barriers stand in the way , one being that Trump ’ s pick for Treasury secretary – Steve Mnuchin – has not yet been confirmed as Democrats hold up the president 's Cabinet picks . Wide-ranging fiscal reform could be difficult to enact without a Treasury secretary installed .
“ Democrats have thwarted [ Trump ’ s ] efforts to get a Treasury secretary – who will actually be driving that train when it comes to tax policy , ” former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown said on ███ Thursday .
“ It ’ s been nineteen days . I know Donald Trump can work out good deals but , it ’ s been nineteen days . I think people need to relax and give the guy at least his full Cabinet , and give him a month maybe ? ” he said .
Another sticking point is the subject of a border-adjustment tax as part of the package , which would tax imports while exempting exports . The tax is part of the House Republican proposal , though Trump earlier had dismissed it as “ too complicated . ”
“ Anytime I hear border adjustment , I don ’ t love it , ” Trump told The Wall Street Journal in January . “ Because usually it means we ’ re going to get adjusted into a bad deal . That ’ s what happens. ” However , the White House later floated the tax as a way to help pay for the border wall at the U.S.-Mexico border .
Trump campaigned repeatedly on tax reform , promising to reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three , and lower the corporate rate from 35 to 15 percent . The House GOP framework has similar contours , with the same number of tax brackets , a call to reduce rates , a repeal of the so-called `` death tax '' and a vow to simplify the system so taxes can be done on a form `` as simple as a postcard . ''
Grover Norquist , the head of Americans for Tax Reform and one of Washington 's most outspoken advocates for tax cuts , has given the House Republicans a boost by endorsing their plan , even with the border-adjustment tax that he doesn ’ t like on its own .
“ I have personally said the package put together by House leadership is fine , is solid , is radically pro-growth . That is not an endorsement of a piece of it , but together it ’ s a great thing , ” he told ███ .
While the border adjustment measure is opposed by some corporations , Ryan has said the plan will “ level the playing field and make America more competitive . ”
We have the worst tax code in the industrialized world for businesses . Our plan will level the playing field & make America more competitive pic.twitter.com/I3JklEru7j — Paul Ryan ( @ SpeakerRyan ) January 30 , 2017

Matt Drudge sounded the siren earlier this week when he tweeted that “[the] Republican party should be sued for fraud. NO discussion of tax cuts now. Just lots of crazy. Back to basics, guys!”

Republican party should be sued for fraud. NO discussion of tax cuts now. Just lots of crazy. Back to basics, guys! pic.twitter.com/5uHIg8klq6 — MATT DRUDGE (@DRUDGE) February 8, 2017

Drudge's tweet garnered a mixed response on Twitter, with some apparent Trump supporters echoing the call and others urging the public to give GOP leaders a chance to deliver on their agenda.

@DRUDGE We need those tax cuts!! A lot of people were excited about them. Never grow the economy w/o tax cuts & regulations roll-back. — Pro-Lifer For Trump (@MyPresidentme) February 8, 2017

@DRUDGE kind of impatient?? Only week 3. Still trying to get cabinet confirmed. Never heard promise by Feb 8th. — Boleslaw The Brave (@boleslawthebrav) February 8, 2017

The fedora-donning Drudge Report founder's complaint speaks to a deep and long-standing suspicion from the Republican base about so-called “establishment” lawmakers stopping short of pursuing big changes -- on entitlements, taxes and more.

While the Trump White House has moved at a furious pace to sign executive orders dealing with immigration, jobs and law enforcement -- and Congress has moved to roll back several Obama-era regulations -- some have voiced concern that both the push to replace ObamaCare and to overhaul the tax code are losing steam.

Fox News host Sean Hannity directed criticism Thursday night mostly at GOP leaders on Capitol Hill, contrasting Congress' slow pace with Trump's rapid-fire executive orders.

“Delaying these tax cuts means delaying the ability for tens of millions of Americans to fulfill the promise of the American Dream,” he said.

""I'm putting the GOP on notice,"" Hannity said. ""No more excuses. No more explanations. Go to work, roll up your sleeves, and do your job.""

Trump, for his part, appears keen on advancing a plan. In a meeting with airline executives Thursday, Trump promised a “phenomenal” tax plan.

“We're going to be announcing something, I would say over the next two or three weeks, that will be phenomenal in terms of tax and developing our aviation infrastructure,"" he teased.

The Wall Street Journal reported that while White House officials have been discussing tax issues with House and Senate Republicans, Trump's announcement caught GOP officials by surprise. House Speaker Paul Ryan told Fox News last week that tax reform was eyed for the spring, after an ObamaCare repeal.

""You can't do them both at the same time because of how the budget system works,"" he said. House Republicans are working on a plan, but have not formally introduced a bill.

However, a number of barriers stand in the way, one being that Trump’s pick for Treasury secretary – Steve Mnuchin – has not yet been confirmed as Democrats hold up the president's Cabinet picks. Wide-ranging fiscal reform could be difficult to enact without a Treasury secretary installed.

“Democrats have thwarted [Trump’s] efforts to get a Treasury secretary – who will actually be driving that train when it comes to tax policy,” former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown said on Fox News Thursday.

“It’s been nineteen days. I know Donald Trump can work out good deals but, it’s been nineteen days. I think people need to relax and give the guy at least his full Cabinet, and give him a month maybe?” he said.

Another sticking point is the subject of a border-adjustment tax as part of the package, which would tax imports while exempting exports. The tax is part of the House Republican proposal, though Trump earlier had dismissed it as “too complicated.”

“Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don’t love it,” Trump told The Wall Street Journal in January. “Because usually it means we’re going to get adjusted into a bad deal. That’s what happens.” However, the White House later floated the tax as a way to help pay for the border wall at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump campaigned repeatedly on tax reform, promising to reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three, and lower the corporate rate from 35 to 15 percent. The House GOP framework has similar contours, with the same number of tax brackets, a call to reduce rates, a repeal of the so-called ""death tax"" and a vow to simplify the system so taxes can be done on a form ""as simple as a postcard.""

Grover Norquist, the head of Americans for Tax Reform and one of Washington's most outspoken advocates for tax cuts, has given the House Republicans a boost by endorsing their plan, even with the border-adjustment tax that he doesn’t like on its own.

“I have personally said the package put together by House leadership is fine, is solid, is radically pro-growth. That is not an endorsement of a piece of it, but together it’s a great thing,” he told Fox News.

While the border adjustment measure is opposed by some corporations, Ryan has said the plan will “level the playing field and make America more competitive.”

taxes,BBC News,1,http://www.bbc.com/news/world-43790895,US tax cuts: Are they the biggest in American history?,,Kim Gittleson,"Claim : President Donald Trump has said that the recently passed Republican tax reform legislation is the `` biggest tax cut in US history '' .
Verdict : It is not the biggest tax cut in US history , measured as either a percentage of US GDP or in absolute terms . It is however , the biggest corporate tax cut in US history .
It 's tax day in America - something most Americans dread .
But this year , the filing of both personal and corporate taxes has become even more complicated due to the recently passed tax reform bill in the United States .
President Donald Trump touted the legislation in a speech on 16 April in Hialeah , Florida , saying : `` We have the biggest tax cut in history , bigger than the Reagan tax cut . Bigger than any tax cut . ''
But while most Americans are filing for 2017 and so wo n't feel the biggest impact until next year - is the claim true ?
Various think tanks and websites have attempted to calculate the total reduction in taxes for both US citizens and corporations this year .
The Committee for a Responsible Budget crunched the numbers and said President Trump 's tax cuts would be the eighth-largest in US history , measured as a percentage of GDP ( to do so , they used a study from the US Treasury that looked at the impact of tax reform bills passed in the US between 1940 and 2012 ) .
If you adjust the analysis for rising prices , President Trump 's tax cuts rank fourth overall .
By either measurement , they 're certainly not the biggest in American history .
Interestingly , President Trump might be half right : it seems that corporations will have plenty to cheer this tax day ( that is , if anyone is ever happy after reading through the US tax code ) .
He said in that same speech : `` Our taxes were the highest — or among the highest — but just about , I would say ... they were the highest in the world from a business standpoint . That 's why businesses were leaving . Now , they 're not the lowest , but they 're on the low side . ''
According to an analysis from the Congressional Budget Office looking at corporate tax rates around the globe in 2012 , this is essentially true .
Most analyses suggest that in absolute terms , this year 's reduction of the US corporate tax rate from 35 % to 21 % is the biggest corporate tax cut in US history .
It beats that corporate tax cut passed under former US President Ronald Reagan , which lowered the rate from 46 % to 34 % .
The key thing to remember here is that very few US corporations actually paid the headline federal corporate tax rate of 35 % .
Many US companies take advantage of various loopholes - like being able to deduct the interest they paid on loans - to lower their overall tax bill .
The US Treasury has said that the effective corporate tax rate was 22 % in 2016 . This average ignores the very real differences in taxes paid by companies - which is dependent on the sector in which they operate .
But a recent analysis from Bank of America Merrill Lynch found that the average US company listed on the S & P 500 index had a tax rate of just 19.3 % last year .
And the number is even smaller for US technology firms , which had an average tax rate of just 16.9 % .
Technology firms can often take advantage of the fact that much of the US tax code was written to tax traditional manufacturing companies with physical assets . This allows them to often shift their profits to areas with lower taxes - like countries with lower corporate tax rates .
US corporations currently have an estimated $ 1.2 trillion ( £838bn ) in earnings that are kept overseas - $ 710bn ( £496bn ) of which belongs just to companies in the tech sector .

Verdict: It is not the biggest tax cut in US history, measured as either a percentage of US GDP or in absolute terms. It is however, the biggest corporate tax cut in US history.

It's tax day in America - something most Americans dread.

But this year, the filing of both personal and corporate taxes has become even more complicated due to the recently passed tax reform bill in the United States.

President Donald Trump touted the legislation in a speech on 16 April in Hialeah, Florida, saying: ""We have the biggest tax cut in history, bigger than the Reagan tax cut. Bigger than any tax cut.""

But while most Americans are filing for 2017 and so won't feel the biggest impact until next year - is the claim true?

Big, but not biggest

Various think tanks and websites have attempted to calculate the total reduction in taxes for both US citizens and corporations this year.

The Committee for a Responsible Budget crunched the numbers and said President Trump's tax cuts would be the eighth-largest in US history, measured as a percentage of GDP (to do so, they used a study from the US Treasury that looked at the impact of tax reform bills passed in the US between 1940 and 2012).

If you adjust the analysis for rising prices, President Trump's tax cuts rank fourth overall.

By either measurement, they're certainly not the biggest in American history.

But what about corporations?

Interestingly, President Trump might be half right: it seems that corporations will have plenty to cheer this tax day (that is, if anyone is ever happy after reading through the US tax code).

He said in that same speech: ""Our taxes were the highest — or among the highest — but just about, I would say... they were the highest in the world from a business standpoint. That's why businesses were leaving. Now, they're not the lowest, but they're on the low side.""

According to an analysis from the Congressional Budget Office looking at corporate tax rates around the globe in 2012, this is essentially true.

Most analyses suggest that in absolute terms, this year's reduction of the US corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% is the biggest corporate tax cut in US history.

It beats that corporate tax cut passed under former US President Ronald Reagan, which lowered the rate from 46% to 34%.

So how much will corporations save?

The key thing to remember here is that very few US corporations actually paid the headline federal corporate tax rate of 35%.

Many US companies take advantage of various loopholes - like being able to deduct the interest they paid on loans - to lower their overall tax bill.

The US Treasury has said that the effective corporate tax rate was 22% in 2016. This average ignores the very real differences in taxes paid by companies - which is dependent on the sector in which they operate.

But a recent analysis from Bank of America Merrill Lynch found that the average US company listed on the S&P 500 index had a tax rate of just 19.3% last year.

And the number is even smaller for US technology firms, which had an average tax rate of just 16.9%.

Technology firms can often take advantage of the fact that much of the US tax code was written to tax traditional manufacturing companies with physical assets. This allows them to often shift their profits to areas with lower taxes - like countries with lower corporate tax rates.

US corporations currently have an estimated $1.2 trillion (£838bn) in earnings that are kept overseas - $710bn (£496bn) of which belongs just to companies in the tech sector.

None of those profits is taxed at the US corporate tax rate until those companies decide to ""repatriate"" those profits and bring them back into the United States.

ET Saturday to pass a sweeping tax overhaul worth roughly $ 1.4 trillion , putting the Trump White House a big step closer to its first major legislative victory – and many Americans closer to a tax cut .

Not long after the vote , President Donald Trump tweeted his reaction :
`` We are one step closer to delivering MASSIVE tax cuts for working families across America , '' the president wrote . `` Special thanks to @ SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell and Chairman @ SenOrrinHatch for shepherding our bill through the Senate .

The bill is not yet finalized . Saturday 's vote means the Senate and House have passed similar tax reform plans , but negotiators from both chambers will start meeting Monday to agree on a single piece of legislation that both chambers must approve before it is sent to the president for his signature .
What deductions can I claim under the Senate bill that just passed ?
The Senate bill does away with federal deductions for state and local income and sales taxes , but allows deductions of up to $ 10,000 in local property taxes .

Why does the Senate bill allow deducting medical expenses not covered by insurance ?
Because the Senate bill also repeals ObamaCare ’ s individual mandate , while the House bill does not . If ObamaCare ’ s mandate is repealed , thousands of people are expected to drop their health insurance , raising the cost for those who decide to keep it .

I own a small business . What would this mean for me ?
The Senate bill allows owners of so-called “ pass-through ” businesses ( that is , businesses that aren ’ t incorporated ) to deduct 23 percent of their earnings , and then pay at their personal income tax rate on the remainder . This issue was a key concern of Sens . Ron Johnson , R-Wis. , and Steve Daines , R-Mont. , both of whom announced this week that they would support the bill .
Like the House bill , the Senate bill cuts the current 35 percent rate to 20 percent , but the Senate bill calls for a one-year delay in dropping the rate .

The changes will not have any impact on your taxes for 2017 , which are due to the IRS by April 17 , 2018 ( you get an extra 48 hours to file because the traditional April 15 due date falls on a Sunday ) .
So when will the differences in the bills be hashed out ?
The House will vote on a motion to go to conference on the tax bills on Monday evening . The Senate is expected to vote on a similar measure soon after .

The Senate bill keeps seven tax brackets, but reduces them to 10, 12, 22, 24, 32, 35 and 38.5 percent. (The current brackets are 10, 15, 25, 28, 33, 35, and 39.6 percent.) The House measure condenses seven brackets to four: 12, 25, 35 and 39.6 percent.

What about corporate tax rates?

When will tax reform take effect?

President Trump and congressional Republicans have vowed to make tax reform law before the end of the year. If that happens, most of the provisions would come into force on Jan. 1.

Will tax reform affect my returns for this year?

It 's how taxes work in Denmark , Sweden , and Spain . `` No other industrialized country asks its citizens to jump through as many hoops to calculate their taxes as ours , '' writes Farhad Manjoo at the New York Times .
Politicians ranging from President Obama to Ronald Reagan have supported this tax change — but there are some very rich companies and some very powerful activists standing in its way .
Intuit , the maker of TurboTax , is a particularly powerful opponent . Such a system `` minimizes the taxpayers ' voice and control over the tax process by reducing their role in filing their taxes and getting their own money back , '' David Williams , the company 's chief tax officer , told the Times .
But that excuse does n't hold much water . Under these automatic systems , no one has to let the IRS fill out their taxes for them . They can continue to do it by hand or by TurboTax , or hire an accountant . Intuit knows , however , that many fewer Americans would do their own taxes under this scenario , and that would be a big hit to Intuit 's bottom line .
Some anti-tax conservatives also hate the idea of the IRS filling out sample returns . Grover Norquist , president of Americans for Tax Reform , warns , `` Conservatives , in particular , should see this ploy for what it clearly is : a money-grab by the government . '' The easier and more efficient the tax system is , the more money it will raise , and the less public anger there will be for anti-tax conservatives to harness .
For much more on this subject , ProPublica 's investigation of Intuit 's lobbying against automatic tax filing is the best look at why a policy with so much bipartisan support ca n't seem to pass Congress , and the Sunlight Foundation has even more lobbying numbers here .

Politicians ranging from President Obama to Ronald Reagan have supported this tax change — but there are some very rich companies and some very powerful activists standing in its way.

Intuit, the maker of TurboTax, is a particularly powerful opponent. Such a system ""minimizes the taxpayers' voice and control over the tax process by reducing their role in filing their taxes and getting their own money back,"" David Williams, the company's chief tax officer, told the Times.

But that excuse doesn't hold much water. Under these automatic systems, no one has to let the IRS fill out their taxes for them. They can continue to do it by hand or by TurboTax, or hire an accountant. Intuit knows, however, that many fewer Americans would do their own taxes under this scenario, and that would be a big hit to Intuit's bottom line.

Some anti-tax conservatives also hate the idea of the IRS filling out sample returns. Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, warns, ""Conservatives, in particular, should see this ploy for what it clearly is: a money-grab by the government."" The easier and more efficient the tax system is, the more money it will raise, and the less public anger there will be for anti-tax conservatives to harness.

For much more on this subject, ProPublica's investigation of Intuit's lobbying against automatic tax filing is the best look at why a policy with so much bipartisan support can't seem to pass Congress, and the Sunlight Foundation has even more lobbying numbers here. Wonks will want to spend some time with economist Austan Goolsbee's white paper on how automatic filing could work in practice. And you can read Intuit's case against California's Ready Return system here.

If no changes are made in entitlements such as Medicare , younger taxpayers will have to cover unfunded promises of $ 35 trillion .

John Goodman of the National Center for Policy Analysis agrees . `` Looking to the future , a young person has to realize his taxes are going to increase enormously or the benefits will be cut enormously or we just go broke . ''
How much would taxes have to go up to cover promised benefits ?
The Congressional Budget Office examined the issue and found young Americans could face staggering tax increases in decades to come .
The CBO reported that in order to keep entitlement benefits where they are , taxes would have to increase by 48 percent in 2030 , and by a whopping 86 percent in 2050 .
That would drive the top rate to more than 73 percent , the highest since 1980 .
Corporate rates would also have to increase from 35 to 65 percent .
Charles Blahous , a trustee of Social Security and Medicare , said `` it 's clear you do have to make some type of explicit tax increase , if you do n't change the benefits of those programs specifically . ''
That is why the CBO wrote that without those additional revenues , the cost of entitlements `` will increase federal debt to unsupportable levels . ''
Advocates for entitlement programs , however , say Americans reject any changes to benefits .
Alex Lawson , of `` Social Security Works , '' said `` we represent the view that 's held by the vast majority of Americans , independents , Republicans , Democrats . And they say absolutely no benefit cuts to Social Security or Medicare or Medicaid . ''
Lawson argues ways can be found to reduce health care costs , though that 's unlikely to make up a $ 35 trillion shortfall .

`` Right now , for every dollar we spend on the young people , we are spending $ 4 on seniors , '' Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker told `` ███ Sunday . '' `` Right now , in Medicare , the average person pays for one-third of the cost of the Medicare program . ''
`` So we 're paying a greater share of Medicare benefits than we ever intended , '' MacGuineas said . `` And right now we have no plan and no ability to pay for all the promises looking down the road . ''
And the longer the nation waits to fix entitlements , the more painful the fixes will have to be .
Blahous said `` we 're already very much late in the game '' in terms of finding solutions that are workable and not too onerous .
`` With too much further delay , '' he said , `` I do n't care whether you are on the left or the right , you 're not going to be able to swallow the solution . ''

Miller, Rowan Scarborough","Former New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg , the latest entry in the Democratic presidential race , has argued in favor of taxing the poor .
As recently as last year , the billionaire media mogul made the case that higher taxes on the poor can force them to make better and healthier life choices .
“ The question is do you want to pander to those people or do you want them to live longer , ” Mr. Bloomberg said in a speech in April 2018 to the International Monetary Fund in Washington .
A video of his remarks has been circulating on social media since Mr. Bloomberg announced in White House run Sunday .
He made the remarks in defense of regressive taxes , those taxes that are applied uniformly and hit the poor harder , such as taxes on cigarettes or soft drinks .
“ Yes they are [ regressive ] , ” said Mr. Bloomberg , who famously attempted to ban Big Gulp soft drinks in New York City to protect the poor for getting fat . “ That ’ s the good thing about them because the problem is in people who don ’ t have a lot of money . And so higher taxes should have a bigger impact on their behavior and how they deal with themselves . ”
People viewing the video on Twitter labeled Mr. Bloomberg a “ wannabe-dictator ” and “ pretty elitist . ”
The stance earned him the nickname “ Nanny State Mayor ” when he unsuccessfully pushed the Big Gulp ban beginning in 2012 . But his tax-the-poor rhetoric now flies in the face of the Democratic presidential rivals ’ mantra of tax the rich .
Mr. Bloomberg explained how the higher taxes are good for the poor .
“ I listen to people saying , ‘ Oh , we don ’ t want to tax the poor. ’ Well , we want the poor to live longer so they can get an education and enjoy life . That ’ s why you do want to do exactly what a lot of people say you don ’ t want to do , ” he said .
He later added , “ There is just no question . If you raise taxes on full sugary drinks , for example , they will drink less and there is just no question that full sugary drinks are one of the major contributors to obesity and obesity is one of the major contributors to heart disease and cancer and a variety of other things . ”
He said not raising taxes on behavior that is unhealthy would be the same as continuing to use coal to ensure coal miners have jobs or going to war to give U.S. Army members “ something to do . ”
“ The comparison is a life or a job , or taxes or life , which do you want to do ? Take your poison , ” said Mr. Bloomberg .","Former New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, the latest entry in the Democratic presidential race, has argued in favor of taxing the poor.

Fifty-nine percent of voters polled said they would support the plan outlined by the Trump administration , compared to just 20 percent of voters who said they would oppose the plan .
Trump wants to cut the corporate tax rate from 35 to 20 percent , and to shrink the number of individual tax brackets from 7 down to 3 tiers at 12 percent , 25 percent and 35 percent . Other features of the plan voters indicated they would support include a one-time repatriation tax for income held overseas , and a repeal of the estate tax .
Voters showed the most support for the provision of the plan that raises the standard deduction that citizens can claim on their tax returns from $ 12,000 to $ 24,000 . Sixty-two percent of voters want this feature in the final tax reform proposal .
The respondents do not want to see U.S. companies evade taxes overseas , and are still unsure about cutting the corporate interest rate . Roughly 39 percent of voters think the corporate interest rate should be lower , while 38 percent oppose a substantial cut .
Trump and Clinton voters are split over whether or not high-income Americans will pay more in taxes under the administration ’ s reform proposal . Thirty-six percent of Trump voters say wealthy Americans will pay more , while only 22 percent of Clinton voters believe that proposition . The majority of Clinton voters ( 57 percent ) think wealthy Americans will pay less in taxes if Congress approves the plan . Only 27 percent of Trump voters agree .

But both Republicans and Democrats appear open to accommodating each other ’ s priorities , which could make the path to a deal smoother , according to the officials .

The House recently passed a five-month extension of the highway program to buy time for talks . Senate leaders on Tuesday unveiled a competing proposal that would extend the highway program for six years . The measure provides only three years of funding , which could prove unacceptable to the House . It also stumbled in an initial Senate procedural vote on Tuesday .

Some experts say it is too difficult to fix the tax code piecemeal , given the complex intermingling of individual and corporate tax rules . But Mr. Ryan has made a practical calculation that the moment is ripe for what would still amount to a substantial revamp . He would seek a broader tax rewrite , including lower rates for individuals and corporations , after President Barack Obama leaves office .

The rules also have encouraged U.S. firms to park hundreds of billions in earnings offshore to avoid U.S. taxes , and to shift their headquarters overseas , often through a merger with a foreign firm .
Congressional aides say that the current talks are buoyed by each side ’ s openness to key priorities of the other side . For Republicans , a top goal is eliminating the U.S. system of world-wide taxation and replacing it with one that generally exempts overseas earnings , similar to that in use in most other countries .

Democrats as well as some Republicans , meanwhile , want to establish some kind of minimum tax on some portion of multinationals ’ future foreign earnings , as well as other anti-abuse rules . Without that , they say American firms could exploit a new tax system , for example by shifting domestic earnings offshore where they wouldn ’ t be taxed by the U.S .

The administration has signaled that it is at least open to consider some special tax treatment for intellectual-property income , but officials worry about the loss of tax revenue that would result .
Both sides have already agreed on the utility of a one-time tax on firms ’ past foreign earnings currently held overseas . Such a tax would be part of a transition to a new system .

taxes,The Week - News,1,http://theweek.com/articles/727579/4-ideas-gop-tax-plan-that-democrats-should-support,4 ideas in the GOP tax plan that Democrats should support,2017-09-29,"Jeff Spross, Bonnie Kristian, Matthew Walther, Brendan Morrow","`` If you ca n't say anything nice , do n't say anything at all '' is some homespun wisdom that does n't really apply to politics . If someone puts forward a policy that would make America worse off , voters need to know about it . This is eminently true of the new tax reform scheme just released by President Trump and the Republicans .
But perhaps you could amend the wisdom : Once you 've said all the mean things , find a few nice things to say , too . Democrats ca n't just snipe from the sidelines : They need to offer an alternative . And as difficult as bipartisan cooperation is these days , it would still behoove the Democrats to identify which Republican tax ideas might improve the economy and negotiate from there .
So here are four things Trump 's new tax proposal actually gets at least sort of right .
Business investment in the American economy has collapsed over the last few decades . This translates into less economic growth , lower productivity , fewer jobs , and lower wages .
Similar to how you can deduct job expenses from your individual income taxes , a corporation can deduct spending on new capital investments from the federal tax on their profits . But those deductions are complex : The rules change from industry to industry , and the deductions often have to come in pieces over several years .

""If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all"" is some homespun wisdom that doesn't really apply to politics. If someone puts forward a policy that would make America worse off, voters need to know about it. This is eminently true of the new tax reform scheme just released by President Trump and the Republicans.

But perhaps you could amend the wisdom: Once you've said all the mean things, find a few nice things to say, too. Democrats can't just snipe from the sidelines: They need to offer an alternative. And as difficult as bipartisan cooperation is these days, it would still behoove the Democrats to identify which Republican tax ideas might improve the economy and negotiate from there.

So here are four things Trump's new tax proposal actually gets at least sort of right.

1. Encourage businesses to invest more.

Business investment in the American economy has collapsed over the last few decades. This translates into less economic growth, lower productivity, fewer jobs, and lower wages.

Similar to how you can deduct job expenses from your individual income taxes, a corporation can deduct spending on new capital investments from the federal tax on their profits. But those deductions are complex: The rules change from industry to industry, and the deductions often have to come in pieces over several years.

So the GOP is proposing something called ""full expensing."" Basically, all companies get to write off an investment as soon as it happens, and keep writing it off for the next five years. The idea is to make the tax benefit more certain, simpler, and immediate, thus incentivizing more investment.

Obviously, you can quibble over details. (For example, should it be five years?) And full expensing could definitely benefit some types of businesses more than others. But the overall idea would still pump money into more jobs and growth.

2. Stop encouraging corporate debt.

Another thing corporations can expense from their taxes is the interest they pay on their debt. Unfortunately, this also makes it more attractive for businesses to finance themselves by borrowing rather than by raising new equity. Companies have piled on debt, especially in recent years. And as we learned from the Great Recession, debt in the private sector can spiral out of control.

Republicans aren't proposing to eliminate the expense for interest entirely, just ""partially limit"" it. But this would at least lower the incentive to borrow.

Some conservatives would prefer to fix this problem by just cutting the tax on corporate profits or eliminating it entirely. That's not a completely crazy option. But if you did get rid of the corporate income tax, you'd need to compensate by jacking taxes on capital gains way up.

Come to think of it, that's also something Democrats would be more likely to do.

3. Improve the child tax credit.

Let's be blunt: Children are wonderful, but they come with lots of expenses, and they don't contribute any income to the family budget. There's a very strong correlation between the ratio of earning parents to non-earning dependents and how likely a family is to be in poverty. Most modern Western nations address this problem by giving all families with children lots of cash aid to help with those expenses. The United States is one of the few that doesn't.

All we have is the child tax credit (CTC). Unfortunately, it's only worth $1,000 per child, and it phases in as income rises so the poorest families get left out.

Trump and the GOP want to increase the CTC, and they want to lengthen the phaseout so families higher up the income ladder can get it. All well and good.

There are a few problems though: First, the CTC eligibility already extends to pretty high earners. Second, the plan doesn't specify how much they want to raise the credit to. Meanwhile, they do specify that only the first $1,000 will still be refundable, which isn't great, because refundability is a key feature in the credit's ability to help the poorest.

Ideally, the CTC should be increased to something like $4,000 per child, and the whole thing should be fully refundable. The phase-in should be eliminated entirely, so all families, no matter how poor, get the full benefit of the credit on their very first dollar. A universal child allowance would be ideal, but Democrats should at least go this far. Still, what Republicans are offering would be an improvement on the status quo.

4. Add to the deficit.

It seems clear at this point that Republican concerns about the deficit are entirely a matter of opportunism and hypocrisy. This new plan, for instance, could lose the Treasury $2.2 trillion in tax revenue over the next decade.

But Democrats shouldn't simply scold Republicans for blowing up the deficit over tax cuts or anything else. Yet they do it: ""We're about to add billions to the deficit to rebuild parts of our country, something we absolutely should do because it's an emergency,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said earlier this month. ""But that makes it even more important that tax reform be fiscally responsible and deficit-neutral.""

As I've argued before, since the federal government controls the supply of the U.S. currency, it doesn't actually need to bring in revenue through taxes. It can just create new money supplies. The true purpose of taxes is to prevent the economy from overheating and to control inflation. And despite the seemingly low unemployment rate, the economy is still quite far from reaching that threshold.

Of course, tax policy is also a pretty good tool for adjusting the distribution of incomes, and thus for making sure everyone has a decent living standard. Since Democrats are ostensibly in the business of lifting up the lowest earners, they ought to leap at the opportunity afforded by the federal government's unique fiscal and monetary powers.

Data on immigrant tax contributions isn’t perfect

It’s important to keep in mind that these numbers are just estimates, but they’re the best that exist. To come up with state and local tax contributions, economists at the Institute on Taxation & Economic Policy crunched data from the US Census Bureau and the Migration Policy Institute to determine the likely number of undocumented immigrants in each state, their average incomes, and their homeownership rates.

Overall, researchers said undocumented immigrants paid an effective tax rate of 8 percent in state and local taxes, compared to the 5.6 percent top tax rate. They paid the highest tax rates in Washington, 10.7 percent, and Illinois, 10.3 percent.

Unauthorized workers also fund the federal government

Undocumented immigrants pay even more federal taxes than state taxes.

Millions of undocumented immigrants file tax returns each year, and they are paying taxes for many benefits they can’t even use.

The most recent IRS data, from 2015, shows that the agency received 4.4 million income tax returns from workers who don’t have Social Security numbers, which includes a large number of undocumented immigrants. That year, they paid $23.6 billion in income taxes. That doesn’t even include workers who paid taxes with fake Social Security numbers on their W-2 forms, which is also common.

How unauthorized immigrants pay their taxes

There are two ways undocumented immigrants pay taxes. First, they pay federal taxes using fake Social Security numbers on their W-2 forms.

Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, is proposing changes to the estate tax.

WASHINGTON—Sen. Bernie Sanders proposed nearly doubling the top estate-tax rate to 77% from 40%, continuing progressives’ push for new and expansive ways to tax the wealthiest Americans and combat inequality.

The plan announced Thursday by Mr. Sanders, an independent from Vermont who is considering a second run for the Democratic presidential nomination, would also lower the per-person exemption from the estate tax to $3.5 million from $11.4 million.

That top estate-tax rate of 77%—matching the top rate in effect from 1941 through 1976—would apply only to wealth above $1 billion. The tax would start at a 45% rate for wealth between $3.5 million and $10 million, and includes 50% and 55% brackets.

As Democrats gear up to challenge President Trump next year, they are looking to raise revenue for government programs, push back against inequality and offer politically popular proposals. Taxing billionaires could check all of those boxes. “From a moral, economic, and political perspective our nation will not thrive when so few have so much and so many have so little,” Mr. Sanders said Thursday. Last week, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) proposed an annual wealth tax. And Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.), who has become one of the most closely watched progressives in Congress, has pushed the party’s conversation to the left with her talk of a 70% top income-tax rate on income above $10 million. Presidential hopefuls are stepping out of the shadows, but their 2020 announcements are far from spontaneous. WSJ’s Shelby Holliday explains. Congress has steadily narrowed the reach of the estate tax over the past few decades so that it is now paid by the estates of just 0.1% of those who die each year. This year, estates will file fewer than 2,000 taxable returns, according to the Tax Policy Center, a Washington research group run by a former Obama administration official. Mr. Sanders’s proposal would push that number to 0.2%, according to his office. The Tax Policy Center estimates that a $3.5 million exemption would mean that 0.5% of estates would pay. Mr. Sanders is also proposing to curb some estate-planning techniques that let wealthy individuals avoid or escape the estate tax. Most Republicans, including Mr. Trump, favor repealing the tax, but they haven’t mustered enough votes to do so. The 2017 tax law doubled the per-person exemption, though that expansion is scheduled to expire after 2025. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Sanders proposed a 65% top tax estate-tax rate, an idea that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton also adopted. The Tax Policy Center estimated that Mr. Sanders’s plan then would increase federal revenue by $237 billion over a decade. Mr. Sanders’s office said his plan would raise up to $2.2 trillion from billionaires. That estimate assumes no deductions for charitable bequests and the money would only come to the government when those people die, not necessarily over the next 10 years.

The state’s tax collectors are the most obsessive bureaucrats in the nation.

For over six years, California has had a top marginal income-tax rate of 13.3 percent, the highest in the nation. About 150,000 households in a state of 40 million people now pay nearly half of the total annual state income tax.

The state legislature sold that confiscatory tax rate on the idea that it was a temporary fix and would eventually be phased out. No one believed that. California voters, about 40 percent of whom pay no state income taxes, naturally approved the extension of the high rate by an overwhelming margin.

California recently raised gas taxes by 40 percent and now has the second-highest gas taxes in the United States.

California has the ninth-highest combined state and local sales taxes in the country, but its state sales tax of 7.3 percent is America’s highest. As of April 1, California is now applying that high state sales tax to goods that residents buy online from out-of-state sellers.

In late 2017, the federal government capped state and local tax deductions at $10,000. For high earners in California, the change effectively almost doubled their state and local taxes.

Such high taxes, often targeting a small percentage of the population, may have brought California a budget surplus of more than $20 million. Yet California is never satiated with high new tax rates that bring in additional revenue. It’s always hungry for more.

Scott Wiener, a Democratic state senator from San Francisco, has introduced a bill that would create a new California estate tax. Wiener outlined a death tax of 40 percent on estates worth more than $3.5 million for single Californians or more than $7 million for married couples.

Given the soaring valuations of California properties, a new estate tax could force children to sell homes or family farms they inherited just to pay the tax bills.

Soon, even more of the Californian taxpayers who chip in to pay half of the state income taxes will flee in droves for low-tax or no-tax states.

What really irks California taxpayers are the shoddy public services that they receive in exchange for such burdensome taxes. California can be found near the bottom of state rankings for schools and infrastructure.

San Francisco ranks first among America’s largest cities in property crimes per capita. The massive concrete ruins of the state’s quarter-built and now either canceled or postponed multibillion-dollar high-speed-rail system are already collecting graffiti.

Roughly a quarter of the nation’s homeless live in California. So do about one-third of all Americans on public assistance. Approximately one-fifth of the state’s population lives below the poverty line. About one-third of Californians are enrolled in Medi-Cal, the state’s health-care program for low-income residents.

California’s social programs are magnets that draw in the indigent from all over the world, who arrive in search of generous health, education, legal, nutritional, and housing subsidies. Some 27 percent of the state’s residents were not born in the United States.

Last month alone, nearly 100,000 foreign nationals were stopped at the southern border, according to officials. Huge numbers of migrants are able to make it across without being caught, and many end up in California.

A lot of upper-middle-class taxpayers feel not only that California fails to appreciate their contributions, but that the state often blames them for not paying even more — as if paying about half of their incomes to local, state, and federal governments somehow reveals their greed.

The hyper-wealthy liberal denizens of Hollywood, Silicon Valley, and the coastal enclaves often seem exempt from the consequences of the high taxes they so often advocate for others. The super-rich either have the clout to hire experts to help them avoid such taxes, or they simply have so much money that they are not much affected by even California’s high taxes.

What is the ideology behind such destructive state policies?

Venezuela, which is driving out its middle class, is apparently California’s model. Venezuelan leaders believed in providing vast subsidies for the poor. The country’s super-rich are often crony capitalists who can avoid high taxes.

Similarly, California is waging an outright war on the upper middle class, which lacks the numbers of the poor and the clout of the rich.

Those who administer California’s plagued department of motor vehicles and high-speed-rail authority may often be inept and dysfunctional, but the state’s tax collectors are the most obsessive bureaucrats in the nation.

What is Sacramento’s message to those who combine to pay half the state’s income taxes and have not yet left California?

Brackets: The House has four: 12%, 25%, 35% and 39.6%. The Senate keeps seven but lowers them all: 10%, 12%, 22.5%, 25%, 32.5%, 35% and 38.5%.

Child tax credit: Increases from $1,000 to $1,600 in House bill, $1,650 in Senate bill per child.

Corporate cut: The House would lower the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% next year, and the Senate would do it starting in 2019.

Estate tax: The House would double the current exemption to apply only to estates worth more than $10 million next year, and phase the tax out completely over six years; Senate would double the exemption next year but otherwise keep the tax.

Major medical expenses: Deduction for expenses that exceed 10% of a taxpayer's income would be eliminated by the House; the Senate does not change this deduction.

Mortgage interest: For new mortgages, only interest on the first $500,000 borrowed for a primary home would be deductible under the House bill, and interest on mortgages for second homes and home equity loans would no longer be deductible; the Senate would not not change the current limit, which is for the first $1 million borrowed, but would end the deduction for home equity loans.

State and local taxes: The House bill would allow a deduction for up to $10,000 in property taxes, but end deductions for income or sales taxes; the Senate would eliminate all of them.

Student loan interest: Deduction eliminated by the House bill; left intact by the Senate.

Teacher purchases: Deduction for teachers who buy supplies for their classrooms would be eliminated by the House bill but left in place by the Senate.

There are growing warnings on Capitol Hill that the nation could be rolling toward an end-of-the-year fiscal train wreck.

""The looming tax hike will be absolutely devastating,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said.

""You can call this a fiscal cliff. You can call it 'Taxmageddon' as others have done. Whatever you call it, it will be a disaster for the middle class,"" Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, added.

And Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., said: ""It's a tsunami; there's no question about it, and it's coming.""

What's coming? The Bush-era tax cuts expire along with the payroll tax break; the nation's borrowing authority bumps against its limit; and huge mandatory spending cuts — half targeting defense — are set to kick in.

All this could trigger another recession, but Congress is not likely to do much about it until after November's election.

Recession Warnings

Last week, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office also weighed in: Unless Congress acts to change current law, it said, spending cuts and tax increases could shrivel next year's growth to a mere one-half of 1 percent, which would probably be seen as a recession.

Earlier this month, Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, announced that the House will vote to extend all of the Bush-era tax breaks.

""Any sudden tax hike would hurt our economy, so this fall, before the election, the House of Representatives will vote to stop the largest tax increase in American history,"" he said.

It's quite likely such a bill would pass, but only in the House. Republicans could then use that vote on the campaign trail to accuse House Democrats who might oppose the measure of wanting to raise everyone's taxes. But Democratic leaders insist tax breaks for the very wealthy should not be extended.

Democrats Respond

Senate Majority leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., responded last week to the GOP colleagues who'd written demanding that the Senate renew all the expiring cuts.

""I say to the 41 Republicans and Sen. Hatch who sent me this letter, move on revenues, we could have had a deal a long time ago,"" he said. ""The president said that when we got together at the White House last Wednesday.""

Reid has also made it clear he will not back GOP efforts to spare the Pentagon from some $50 billion in automatic spending cuts next year in what's known as ""the sequester."" The threat of such cuts was meant to spur Congress into agreeing on a 10-year deficit reduction deal, but the deal never came together. Reid says Congress must now face the consequences.

""I don't like sequester. ... It was a hard pill to swallow, but it was the right thing to do,"" he said. ""If we're going to ever reduce the staggering deficits, we're going to have to make some hard decisions.""

That sets up a fight over the sequester with defense hawks led by Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee.

""I just can't imagine it going through because of what [Defense] Secretary [Leon] Panetta describes as a devastating impact on our ability to defend this nation,"" he said. ""That's our country's first priority.""

Tax Revenues

Not all Republicans side with McCain. Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski says the sequester is a hammer meant to move Congress to come up with deficit reduction — for which she won't rule out higher tax revenues.

""We've got a responsibility to figure this out,"" she said. ""I'm not going to suggest that we just pull the plug and say that never happened.""

Meanwhile, some Republicans and Democrats in the Senate have begun private talks about ways to prevent falling off a fiscal cliff at year's end. One of them, Colorado Democrat Michael Bennet, says everything depends on who wins in November.

""Not to mix a metaphor, but these are huge tectonic plates that are going to shift after this election, when it's not just the tax cuts expiring, but the sequester and the debt ceiling and all the rest,"" he said. ""And I think it's very unlikely that anything's going to be done before the election.""

Lobbyist Trent Lott, a former Mississippi senator and Republican majority leader, says he's seen many other lame-duck sessions after big elections, but none like the one coming up.

""If everything stays pretty much status quo, they might do some things in a lame-duck session, if it's like, you know, the House stays Republican, the Senate stays Democrat and Obama stays in,"" he said.

Facing imminent unpopular scenarios such as higher taxes for everyone and further cuts in military spending , the negotiations taking place behind closed doors in Washington have new impetus to produce results .
Obama 's victory this month with a slightly stronger Democratic majority in the Senate and a slightly weaker Republican majority in the House signaled general public acceptance of the president 's main campaign theme : raising more tax revenue from the rich as part of a deficit-reduction package .
In particular , Obama and Democrats insist that wealthy Americans , so far identified as those with income higher than $ 200,000 for individuals or $ 250,000 for families , should pay more taxes than they do now so that rates for everyone else stay the same .
However , the new Congress to be seated in January includes 39 senators , including Chambliss , and 219 House members who have signed the anti-tax pledge pushed by Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform , according to the group 's website .
The House total constitutes a narrow majority in the 435-seat chamber , though some members have denounced their allegiance to the pledge much like Chambliss did Wednesday in an interview with CNN affiliate WMAZ , a Georgia television station .
`` I care more about my country than I do about a 20-year-old pledge , '' said Chambliss , who faces re-election for a third Senate term in 2014 .
Referring to Norquist , who has vowed to oppose candidates who break the pledge , Chambliss said that `` if we do it his way , then we 'll continue in debt , and I just have a disagreement with him about that . ''
In response to Chambliss , Norquist told CNN that the senator `` wrote a commitment to the voters of Georgia . ''
`` He got elected and re-elected making that commitment , '' said Norquist . `` He 's never promised me anything . ''
Norquist said he believes Chambliss was `` caught '' on a TV station and that `` he said some things perhaps that did n't make sense . ''
If the senator wants to `` change his mind and become a tax increaser , '' Norquist said , `` he needs to have that conversation with the people of Georgia . ''
Chambliss acknowledged that Norquist and Americans for Tax Reform will likely work against his re-election because of the issue .
`` But I do n't worry about that because I care too much about my country , '' Chambliss said , adding that he was `` willing to do the right thing and let the political consequences take care of themselves . ''
`` To call Chambliss an idiot is to insult people of lower intelligence , '' blogger Judson Phillips of Tea Party Nation wrote . `` Chambliss is a poster child for every thing that is wrong with the political class in Washington . ''
Later in his post , Phillips sharpened his point : `` If you give your word and you break your word , then you are a liar . ''
Phillips also called Chambliss the worst RINO -- Republican In Name Only -- in Washington , citing an acronym that conservatives use for those they consider to be sell-out politicians .
`` If you are a worthless Republican politician and you want some good press from the liberal media , '' Phillips wrote , `` all you have to do now days is say you are considering abandoning your pledge not to raise taxes . ''
However , other conservative voices , including veteran Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma , have questioned whether the Norquist pledge remains politically relevant in the face of the mounting federal debt and Obama 's re-election .
William Kristol , the editor of the Weekly Standard , said after the November 6 vote that Republicans should consider going along with the president 's call for making the wealthy pay higher taxes , telling `` Fox News Sunday '' that `` it would n't kill the country . ''
On the same program , GOP Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee said `` the yin and the yang of this is that we know there has to be revenues . ''
`` I have n't met a wealthy Republican or Democrat in Tennessee that 's not willing to contribute more as long as they know we solve the problem , '' Corker noted , adding that reforming entitlement programs such as Medicare , the government-run health care system for senior citizens , was another key part of the package .
Norquist and other conservatives argue that shrinking the government is the only way to properly address the deficit issue . Their mantra is that America spends too much on government , not that it collects too little in taxes .
The Taxpayer Protection Pledge says the signer will `` oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses '' and will `` oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits , unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates . ''
That commitment puts any adherents in conflict with the direction of the deficit negotiations under way between the White House and Congress .
At the Center for the National Interest on Monday , Norquist predicted that Republicans would prevent any deficit deal from containing a tax increase .
Long a defining difference between Democrats and Republicans , the tax issue has stymied efforts to work out a deficit deal for the past two years .
Obama and House Speaker John Boehner came close to agreement last year before conservative rejection of any increased revenue and liberal resistance to entitlement reform scuttled the effort .
Boehner , the Ohio Republican who has emerged as party leader in the deficit talks , agrees to the concept of increased revenue , though he and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky both remain opposed to actually raising tax rates .
Instead , they propose broad tax reform that will lower rates while eliminating unspecified loopholes and exemptions to spur economic growth that they say will result in more overall government revenue .
Chambliss , whose voting record got a perfect rating in 2010 from the American Conservative Union , has played a supporting role in the deficit debate .
He joined colleagues from both parties in the so-called Gang of Six senators trying to work out a comprehensive deal on the sidelines of the main talks between the White House and Congress .
Last year , Norquist 's group called at one point for Chambliss and the other two Republicans to drop out of the Gang of Six talks that were considering increased tax revenue as part of the deal .
Norquist later sent a letter to Chambliss and GOP colleagues Coburn and Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming to clarify that their stance met the conditions of the pledge because they wanted any increase in revenue to come from economic growth spurred by lower tax rates .
`` This is very encouraging news from you , '' Norquist wrote then . `` It means that you will fulfill the Taxpayer Protection Pledge you made to your constituents and the American people to oppose and vote against legislated net income tax increases .

The president and Mrs. Obama signed their tax returns on Monday -- one week before the April 15 deadline for Americans to file their 2012 returns .
Itemized deductions of $ 258,385 brought the Obama 's taxable income down to $ 335,026 . The first family deducted $ 45,056 in interest on the mortgage for their home in Chicago , plus $ 36,554 in state and local taxes and $ 26,751 in real estate taxes .
Through withholding and estimated tax payments during the year , the Obamas paid $ 129,029 to the Internal Revenue Service -- an overpayment of $ 16,815 . The Obamas directed that , rather than receive a refund , the overpayment will be applied to their taxes for next year .
The Obamas also claimed $ 39,875 in income from outside the United States . A White House official said all of that income came from book royalties , but did not disclose details about which countries the income came from . The official was not authorized to comment publicly on Obama 's taxes and spoke on condition of anonymity .
The president and first lady reported donating $ 150,034 -- or 24.6 percent of their income -- to 33 charities . That 's a slight dip from the previous year , when the Obamas donated more than $ 172,000 . The largest contribution last year was a $ 103,871 donation to Fisher House Foundation , which provides humanitarian services to military members , veterans and their families . Other charitable groups that received donations from the president for $ 5,000 or less include the American Red Cross , Habitat for Humanity , Boys & Girls Clubs of America and the United Negro College Fund .
The president and the first lady also paid $ 29,450 in income taxes to Illinois , according to their state tax returns .
The White House also released tax returns for Vice President Joe Biden and his wife , Jill Biden . The Bidens paid $ 87,851 in federal income taxes on $ 385,072 in adjusted gross income , for an effective federal tax rate of 22.8 percent . The vice president and his wife paid state income taxes in two states -- $ 13,531 in Delaware and $ 3,593 in Virginia . They reported donating $ 7,190 to charity .","President Obama made less in 2012 than in any other year since taking office, with about 40 percent of the nearly $609,000 in income that he and first lady Michelle Obama reported coming from book sales.

Obama, who renewed his call for higher taxes on top earners in the budget he released Wednesday, paid $112,214 in taxes last year, putting his effective federal tax rate at 18.4 percent. The Obamas donated almost one-quarter of their income to charity, according to tax returns released by the White House.

Most of the $608,611 that the Obamas reported in adjusted gross income came from the president's salary, as he reported $394,840 in wages. An additional $258,772 came from royalties from his books, including his 1995 memoir ""Dreams From My Father,"" his 2006 political book, ""The Audacity of Hope,"" and a 2010 children's book, ""Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters.""

He says if Dems are to deal on entitlements and GOP on raising tax revenue , pledge has to go
Avlon : Even Reagan closed loopholes , raised taxes ; time to realize extreme stance no help
In recent days , the declarations of independence from Norquist 's absolutist anti-tax pledge have been coming fast and furious .
Add Southern Sens . Saxby Chambliss and Lindsey Graham to the growing list , along with Reps. Peter King , Steve LaTourette and Scott Rigell .
Chambliss kicked off the most recent outbreak of common sense by telling a Georgia TV station , `` I care more about my country than I do about a 20-year-old pledge . '' He added , `` If we do it ( Norquist 's ) way , then we 'll continue in debt . ''
On ABC 's `` This Week , '' Graham doubled down by saying , `` I agree with Grover , we should n't raise rates , but I think Grover is wrong when it comes to we ca n't cap deductions and buy down debt . ... I will violate the pledge , long story short , for the good of the country , only if Democrats will do entitlement reform . ''
King agreed with Chambliss on NBC 's `` Meet the Press , '' saying , `` A pledge you signed 20 years ago , 18 years ago , is for that Congress . ... For instance , if I were in Congress in 1941 , I would have signed a declaration of war against Japan . I 'm not going to attack Japan today . The world has changed , and the economic situation is different . ''
And on CNN last weekend , LaTourette and Rigell told Ali Velshi that they thought the straitjacket pledge was an impediment to dealing with the deficit and the debt .
This post-election outbreak of pragmatism is welcome and needed . These senators and congressmen are profiles in courage for speaking out against the stranglehold that one self-appointed activist and lobbyist has had on bipartisan governing .
Norquist , who leads the conservative activist group Americans for Tax Reform , is both a colorful character and committed ideologue , infamous for sound bites like this : `` I do n't want to abolish government . I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub . ''
The signature item for Americans for Tax Reform is a pledge that commits signers to oppose any tax increases at all , for all time -- not just tax rate increases , but any increases in tax revenue .
This distinction makes a real difference in the current deficit and debt deal negotiations . Going back to the Bowles-Simpson Commission , the obvious common ground for negotiations has been for Democrats to compromise on spending cuts and entitlement reform and Republicans to compromise on increased tax revenue . This can be done -- as the Bowles-Simpson Commission demonstrated -- by potentially even lowering some tax rates but closing loopholes to raise revenue . This is what 's known as a win-win .
The biggest stumbling block for tea party conservatives has been Norquist , who says any new revenue violates the pledge and promises to invite a primary challenge to any member of Congress who puts revenues on the table . Given the number of safe seats carved up in the rigged system of redistricting , a primary challenge from the wings is what most members of Congress fear most . The result is gridlock : an inability to reason together and make a long-term deal for the good of the country .
It is an ironic problem in some ways : Tea party congressmen rose to power on a promise to deal with deficits and debt . Putting anti-tax absolutism ahead of that goal may play well with special interests , but it undercuts the ability to govern in the national interest . That 's what is at stake .

These pronouncements from Chambliss , Graham & Co. put them in the company of party leaders like John Boehner , John McCain and Jeb Bush , who have publicly dismissed the pledge as a distraction from the business of governing .
`` I ran for office three times , '' said Bush , who is already being discussed as a 2016 candidate . `` The pledge was presented to me three times . I never signed the pledge . I cut taxes every year I was governor . I do n't believe you outsource your principles and convictions to people . ''
This pragmatic statement in the summer of 2012 helped break the fever of groupthink . Norquist called Bush 's comments an `` insult . ''
In July in an opinion column in the New York Times , respected fiscal conservative Sen. Tom Coburn put Norquist 's pledge in perspective : `` What unifies Republicans is not Mr. Norquist 's tortured definition of tax purity but the idea of a Reagan- or Kennedy-style tax reform that lowers rates and broadens the tax base by getting rid of loopholes and deductions . ''
Coburn 's refusal to pay an oath of fealty to the pledge resulted in a sniping war by Norquist . Most recently , Norquist displayed his distorted perspective by tweeting : `` Barney Frank , Alger Hiss or Tom Coburn ? who said this ? ' I 'm all for the very wealthy paying more taxes ' ``
Comparing Coburn to Hiss -- a convicted traitor and KGB agent -- was both ugly and revealing : This is what happens when partisan politics starts to look like a cult .

“ Think of it : $ 13 billion every decade on the backs of churches and nonprofits , hindering their ability to serve their constituents , ” said Dan Busby , president of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability .
“ I ’ d say the churches have every right to be outraged , ” said David L. Thompson , vice president of public policy for the National Council of Nonprofits . “ It ’ s an oxymoron . It ’ s horrendously unfair . ”
The provision was in the legislation that Congress and President Trump signed in December , but for months it flew under the radar while lawmakers wrestled over the main portion of the law : corporate and individual tax cuts .
Now churches , synagogues , universities and nonprofit groups have learned they must pay taxes on employee fringe benefits such as parking and transportation under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act . A certain provision calls for a 21 percent tax on some fringe benefits and expenses .
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act redefines as income some of the fringe benefits that employers pay for employees ’ parking spaces or commuting costs . Those benefits now are considered “ unrelated business income , ” or UBI for short .
The change means some nonprofit groups must decide among trying to pay more in taxes , cutting employees ’ benefits or making other sacrifices . Some churches and nonprofits are pushing back and have started a nationwide petition to repeal the provision .
Mr. Busby said “ 400,000 houses of worship plus tens of thousands of nonprofit organizations are now paying attention . This issue will not go away until it is repealed. ” The council he presides over was founded by the late Rev . Billy Graham ’ s Evangelistic Association .
Houses of worship are notoriously low on revenue , and many in the D.C. area already have had to cut back on congregant services .
Representatives of D.C. organizations ranging from the Washington Hebrew Congregation to the Washington National Opera said they know about the new tax rule , but scant guidance leaves them with no clue how to calculate what they owe .
In a double whammy , a D.C. law requires employers — including nonprofits — to offer commuter transit benefits , but now federal law taxes those required benefits .
“ That ’ s like taxing a safe workplace , ” said Mr. Thompson . “ That ’ s not a fringe benefit . That ’ s a mandated cost of doing business . ”
D.C.-based nonprofits also must pay a 9.4 percent UBI tax to the District of Columbia , as the city follows federal UBI rules by default .
New York , North Carolina and Minnesota also default to federal UBI tax rules . New York ’ s legislature swiftly passed a bill that eliminates the state-level nonprofit tax , and it awaits Gov . Andrew Cuomo ’ s signature .
People have been left “ scratching their heads , ” Mr. Thompson said . Mr. Busby said that thousands of organizations are likely delinquent on IRS payments since most had no idea the provision even exists .
Addressing the issue last week , White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said changing the law to ensure churches keep their tax-exempt status is “ certainly something that we ’ re looking into . ”
But she defended the tax-code overhaul as providing an economic boost to a broad swath of the U.S .
“ I ’ m not going to make a blanket generalization about every church in America , ” Mrs. Sanders said . “ But certainly the goal of the tax cuts and reforms package was to provide the greatest amount of relief to the greatest number of Americans , and we feel that it ’ s done that . ”
She said other economic policies promoted by Mr. Trump “ have certainly moved the ball forward , made our economy infinitely stronger than it has been in decades . ”
Rep. Kevin Brady , Texas Republican and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , introduced the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and has been a whipping boy for nonprofit advocates .
“ The rationale of parity is absolutely inappropriate , ” Mr. Thompson said .
Mr. Brady has insisted the provision is necessary to level the playing field for nonprofits and for-profits .
“ These provisions apply to both employers that are taxable entities and those that are tax-exempt entities , ” a Brady spokesman said in a statement .
Still , lawmakers on both sides of the aisle aim to snip the unpopular provision . Reps. Mike Conaway , Texas Republican , and Jim Clyburn , South Carolina Democrat , each have introduced a bill that would alter the section that affects nonprofits .
Mr. Clyburn ’ s bill would increase the corporate tax rate , a poke in the eye for Republicans who supported corporate tax cuts . Mr. Conaway ’ s bill would repeal the entire section of the law that taxes nonprofits ’ employee benefits .
The National Council of Nonprofits has endorsed Mr. Conaway ’ s bill .
Groups have begged the IRS and the Treasury Department to delay enforcing the provision and for detailed guidance . They still await a response , Mr. Thompson said .

taxes,ThinkProgress,0,https://thinkprogress.org/elizabeth-warren-tax-preparation-intuit-e2df8036ac25,"Elizabeth Warren wants to make your taxes simpler, but tax preparers won’t let her",,,"Tuesday is the deadline by which Americans have to send the IRS their income tax returns after having spent , according to the Tax Foundation , a cumulative 2.6 billion hours completing them . That time gets spent on keeping good records , scrounging together paperwork , and then filling out the actual forms .
This time suck is not necessarily because the tax code is complicated , however . It ’ s because of the way Americans have to complete their taxes — something that could be much simpler if the tax preparation industry would get out of the way .
And it ’ s a process that Elizabeth Warren wants to change .
In many other countries , the government essentially prepares tax returns for citizens . In Japan , for example , the tax agency sends out a document that states how much each person earned , how much was withheld , and how much is owed in taxes . If someone wants to dispute the numbers , he can go to a tax office to do so , but everyone else simply signs off on the numbers . The same thing happens in Chile , Denmark , Estonia , Finland , Iceland , Norway , Sweden , and Spain .
Employers and banks already have to send the IRS details of how much they paid Americans and how much Americans paid them . The government has almost all of the relevant information , such as W-2s and interest earned . The IRS could then take the data and fill out every taxpayer ’ s form for her . This is what ’ s known in other places as pre-populated tax returns or return-free filing .
Anyone is still free to either dispute the numbers or further itemize their deductions . But for most , it would simply be a matter of signing off . In many of these countries , taxpayers don ’ t even have to do anything for that last step — if they take no action , they are deemed to have accepted the government ’ s pre-populated return .
Such a system would save Americans a collective 225 million hours in preparation time and $ 2 billion in costs , according to one estimate .
The idea has regularly cropped up in the United States . Even President Ronald Reagan called for Americans to “ not even have to fill out a return ” in 1985 and included the idea in his Tax Reform Act .
More recently , Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D-MA ) has introduced legislation that would finally make this a reality for many Americans . Last week , she said she will soon re-introduce the the Tax Filing Simplification Act , which would have the IRS develop a return-free filing option . It would consist of a free online tax filing service that would allow taxpayers to download all the information they need that the agency already has and fill out their form that way . The legislation has a number of cosponsors already : Democratic Sens . Jeanne Shaheen ( NH ) , Tammy Baldwin ( WI ) , Al Franken ( MN ) , Tom Udall ( NM ) , Sheldon Whitehouse ( RI ) , Edward Markey ( VT ) , Tammy Duckworth ( IL ) , Maggie Hassan ( NH ) , and Independent Bernie Sanders ( VT ) .
But a similar bill Warren introduced last year didn ’ t even make it out of committee .
Efforts have been stymied over the years thanks to the deep pockets of the tax preparation industry . Last year , H & R Block lobbied against Warren ’ s bill and spent a total of $ 3 million lobbying the government , in part against such return-free efforts . Intuit , the maker of TurboTax , spend over $ 2 million lobbying last year , with much of it spent in favor of legislation that would permanently block the government from offering these services .
Intuit has lobbied against a number of past bills that would have allowed pre-prepared tax returns for many Americans — and in favor of others that would have blocked the Treasury Department from starting return-free filing .
Intuit has made it clear that any government filing option would threaten its business . “ We anticipate that governmental encroachment at both the federal and state levels may present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future , ” it said in its latest corporate filings . Its lobbying disclosures state that it “ opposes IRS government tax preparation . ”

That time gets spent on keeping good records, scrounging together paperwork, and then filling out the actual forms.

This time suck is not necessarily because the tax code is complicated, however. It’s because of the way Americans have to complete their taxes — something that could be much simpler if the tax preparation industry would get out of the way.

And it’s a process that Elizabeth Warren wants to change.

In many other countries, the government essentially prepares tax returns for citizens. In Japan, for example, the tax agency sends out a document that states how much each person earned, how much was withheld, and how much is owed in taxes. If someone wants to dispute the numbers, he can go to a tax office to do so, but everyone else simply signs off on the numbers. The same thing happens in Chile, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and Spain.

Employers and banks already have to send the IRS details of how much they paid Americans and how much Americans paid them. The government has almost all of the relevant information, such as W-2s and interest earned. The IRS could then take the data and fill out every taxpayer’s form for her. This is what’s known in other places as pre-populated tax returns or return-free filing.

Anyone is still free to either dispute the numbers or further itemize their deductions. But for most, it would simply be a matter of signing off. In many of these countries, taxpayers don’t even have to do anything for that last step — if they take no action, they are deemed to have accepted the government’s pre-populated return.

Such a system would save Americans a collective 225 million hours in preparation time and $2 billion in costs, according to one estimate.

The idea has regularly cropped up in the United States. Even President Ronald Reagan called for Americans to “not even have to fill out a return” in 1985 and included the idea in his Tax Reform Act.

More recently, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has introduced legislation that would finally make this a reality for many Americans. Last week, she said she will soon re-introduce the the Tax Filing Simplification Act, which would have the IRS develop a return-free filing option. It would consist of a free online tax filing service that would allow taxpayers to download all the information they need that the agency already has and fill out their form that way. The legislation has a number of cosponsors already: Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (NH), Tammy Baldwin (WI), Al Franken (MN), Tom Udall (NM), Sheldon Whitehouse (RI), Edward Markey (VT), Tammy Duckworth (IL), Maggie Hassan (NH), and Independent Bernie Sanders (VT).

But a similar bill Warren introduced last year didn’t even make it out of committee.

Efforts have been stymied over the years thanks to the deep pockets of the tax preparation industry. Last year, H&R Block lobbied against Warren’s bill and spent a total of $3 million lobbying the government, in part against such return-free efforts. Intuit, the maker of TurboTax, spend over $2 million lobbying last year, with much of it spent in favor of legislation that would permanently block the government from offering these services.

Intuit has lobbied against a number of past bills that would have allowed pre-prepared tax returns for many Americans — and in favor of others that would have blocked the Treasury Department from starting return-free filing.

Intuit has made it clear that any government filing option would threaten its business. “We anticipate that governmental encroachment at both the federal and state levels may present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future,” it said in its latest corporate filings. Its lobbying disclosures state that it “opposes IRS government tax preparation.”

But the whole industry has chipped in: Major tax preparers have spent nearly $28 million on lobbying since 1998.

Little wonder that it’s lucrative. As things currently stand, about 80 percent of taxpayers rely on a preparer or software to file their taxes, while they pay an average of $200 to tax preparation services a year, which eats up nearly 10 percent of the typical tax return. That makes a tidy profit for companies like Intuit and H&R Block: TurboTax made up more than a third of Intuit’s revenues in 2012.",www.thinkprogress.org,left,achRb2G2bKwTStxK

Talk Of Compromise

Now, the translation: When White House officials talk about revenue, they mean allowing the Bush-era tax cuts to expire for the wealthy. Under the president's definition of revenue, the richest 2 percent would see their top tax rate rise to 39 percent, and he'd also limit deductions and cut out loopholes. That's simply not what McConnell and many of his fellow Republicans mean.

But at this point in the negotiations, no one is saying that — at least not publicly. Instead, there's been a lot of talk of compromise from lawmakers like Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.

""I remain optimistic that when it comes to our economy and when it comes to protecting middle-class families from a whopping tax hike come Jan. 1, that Democrats and Republicans will be able to find common ground,"" he said Monday.

Opposition To Tax Increases

The ability to find common ground may depend on just one man's definition of revenue — a man not in the White House or the Capitol. He's anti-tax lobbyist Grover Norquist, and he's gotten the vast majority of Republicans to sign a pledge saying they will oppose any and all tax increases. A few signatories have recently come out saying they won't be bound by the pledge, but Norquist made it clear Monday on Fox News that they do so at their own peril.

With hundreds of tax breaks jammed into the code, it’s clear that not every provision will survive an overhaul, and those that do may look dramatically different. That’s leaving everyone — lobbyists, executives and lawmakers — scrambling to game out how a new tax system might look.

Here’s a look at five tax breaks that are vulnerable to being dramatically rewritten — or scrapped entirely — and how advocates might fight to save them.

1. The mortgage interest deduction

What is it? The government allows homeowners to deduct up to $1 million each year in mortgage interest, including for vacation homes.

How much does it cost? It’s one of the biggest so-called tax expenditures, which makes it hard to ignore during tax reform when lawmakers are searching for money to pay for lowering rates. The Congressional Budget Office projects the break will cost more than $1 trillion over 10 years.

What might happen? Don’t worry. Virtually no one thinks the deduction — the motherhood and apple pie of tax breaks — is going to vanish completely.

But if tax reform gains traction, the write-off could ultimately look very different than the provision in place today.

Critics have long complained it’s too much of a good thing. They say there’s no reason why the government should subsidize those wealthy enough to spend $1 million on a home.

“That’s crazy,” said Roberton Williams, a tax expert at the Urban Institute.

There are plenty of options that would reduce the value of the deduction while ensuring that it’s still available to middle-class homeowners.

President Barack Obama has proposed capping all deductions — including the mortgage interest write-off — at 28 percent.

Lawmakers could also simply pare it back, focusing the write-off more on those further down the income scale. Capping the break at $500,000 and replacing the deduction with a credit would save $213 billion, according to the Tax Policy Center.

How will lobbyists protect it? Get ready for reminders that the U.S. is only now showing signs of emerging from a years-long housing crisis.

Curbing the break will only hurt housing prices, especially in vacation communities, said Jamie Gregory, deputy chief lobbyist of the National Association of Realtors.

“We finally have housing and the economy headed in the right direction, and we don’t think this is a good time to be messing around with it,” he said.

2. Carried interest

What is it? Hedge fund managers, private equity executives and others working on Wall Street pay a special tax rate on profits-based compensation known as carried interest. Instead of paying ordinary income taxes — which top out at almost 40 percent — carried interest is taxed as a capital gain, generally at a rate of 20 percent. Top earners started paying an additional 3.8 percent tax on their investment income, such as capital gains, this year.

How much does it cost? About $17 billion over 10 years.

What might happen? Democrats have long complained that the break is unfair and that Wall Street executives’ pay ought to be taxed as ordinary income. Amid the crush of tax reform, they might finally get their way if lawmakers decide it’s not worth spending much time worrying about the plight of hedge fund and private equity managers.

How will lobbyists protect it? The industry has repeatedly beaten back Democrats’ efforts to kill the break, saying higher rates would only hurt the economy. “Increasing taxes on carried interest would hurt all partnerships that strengthen thousands of companies across the country,” said Steve Judge, president of the Private Equity Growth Capital Council.",www.politico.com,left,0kwLV9ap7SFj57Ob

""No substantive progress has been made."" That's what House Speaker John Boehner had to say Thursday about efforts to avoid automatic spending cuts and tax increases at year's end.

The administration's lead negotiator, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, met with congressional leaders from both sides of the aisle Thursday, looking for an agreement on the hazard Congress and the White House created last year to focus their minds on deficit reduction.

Perhaps the most important sticking point is over income tax rates. The outcome of the negotiations will determine how many Americans will face higher tax rates — and how much of a hike it will be.

Obama's Proposal

President Obama has proposed that top tax rates for well-off Americans rise to their levels from before the Bush-era tax cuts. But he wants to keep the Bush tax cuts for the middle class. So income tax rates for couples making less than $250,000 and individuals making less than $200,000 would remain where they are.

What would that mean for you? Well, if you're among the well-off and earn more than those amounts, the money you make above those levels would be taxed at 36 percent and 39.6 percent — up a few points from where they are taxed now, and exactly where they were during the Clinton administration. For the top 1 percent of taxpayers, this change would boost their tax bill a lot.

""That tax increase would amount to something in the neighborhood of $120,000,"" says Donald Marron, co-director of the Tax Policy Center.

The center has crunched a lot of numbers related to the tax effects of the fiscal cliff and the various proposals to avoid it. Len Burman, who used to run the center but now is a professor at Syracuse University, says allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire for the well-off would put a dent in the deficit.

""Raising the tax rates to basically the pre-Bush levels for the high-income people would raise about $850 billion over 10 years,"" he says.

But would that be a bulldozer-size dent or a baseball-size dent in the deficit?

""It's significant ... but we're looking at $10 trillion-plus in deficits over the next 10 years, so this is less than 10 percent of the total,"" Burman says.

The president would reduce the deficit an additional 5 percentage points through his proposal to reduce the value of tax deductions for the wealthy.

The Fiscal Plunge Scenario

But what if policymakers can't reach an agreement and we go over this fiscal cliff? Tax rates would go up across the board. The Tax Policy Center says about 90 percent of Americans would see their tax bill increase.

""For a middle-income household, this increase would be around $2,000; for a low-income household, it would be around $400,"" says center co-director Marron.

While that's not a pleasant thought, allowing the Bush-era tax cuts to expire for everyone would cut deficits significantly, Burman says.

""We'd raise $2.2 trillion in income tax revenues over the next 10 years and $430 billion in estate tax revenues,"" he says.

That would cut projected deficits by about 25 percent over the next 10 years — a much more sizable chunk, but still not enough to solve the deficit problem.

Of course, the shock to the economy of the abrupt tax hikes and spending cuts would likely cause the economy to plunge back into recession. That's really why they call it the ""fiscal cliff.""

GOP Pushes Tax Reform

Republicans say hiking rates for anyone is the wrong approach. They want to extend the Bush tax cuts for everyone for one more year. That would mean a $400 billion boost to next year's projected deficit.

But during the year, Republicans say, Washington could work on changes to tax policy and entitlements and try to close the budget gap for the long term. Glenn Hubbard, dean of Columbia University's School of Business and an adviser to Mitt Romney, agrees. He says raising rates is a bad idea.

taxes,Reuters,1,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax/trump-republicans-to-showcase-tax-cut-for-businesses-idUSKCN1BX31E,"Trump, Republicans to showcase tax cut for businesses",2017-09-22,David Morgan,"WASHINGTON ( ███ ) - U.S. President Donald Trump and top Republicans in Congress are about to show how aggressively they intend to cut the corporate tax rate , while trying to avoid the appearance of favoring the wealthy .
The “ Big Six ” team of Republican tax policy makers is expected to release a plan on Wednesday targeting tax cuts for businesses , but offering few clues about how to replace reduced federal revenues , said lobbyists and congressional sources .
Under pressure from corporate America , the team is expected to call for a corporate income tax target rate possibly within a range of 18-23 percent , down from the current rate of 35 percent .
But the Big Six , which includes top Trump aides and congressional Republican leaders , is expected to refrain from cutting the top individual tax rate of 39.6 percent , in a risky step that many Republicans in the House of Representatives could find hard to swallow .
“ They ’ re not going to cut the highest income tax rate . They ’ re not , ” predicted Stephen Moore , a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank . Moore helped write Trump ’ s campaign tax plan .
Overhauling the tax code was a key pledge for Trump in his 2016 presidential campaign . But after eight months in office , he has made only limited progress . Washington has achieved no major tax overhaul since 1986 .
Trump portrays lower corporate taxes as a boon to workers , saying they would lead to more jobs and higher salaries . A rate cut on corporate profits could also be used to benefit shareholders and to offer up more executive bonuses , however .
“ The details leaking out of the Big Six meetings paint a clear picture of an unprecedented tax giveaway for the most fortunate and biggest corporations , ” Senator Ron Wyden , top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee , said this week .
The Big Six — Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin , Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn , Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell , House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and two tax committee chairmen — have been working on their plan for months .
But they are still undecided on key issues , including whether to let businesses write off new investments immediately ; how to lower tax rates for small businesses ; and whether to cut middle-class taxes simply by doubling the standard deduction for individuals and families , according to lobbyists .
Resolving such issues will help determine how aggressively Republicans can cut corporate taxes .
Lobbyists said they do not expect the Big Six to offer many details about the tax loopholes and deductions that could be eliminated to help pay for tax cuts .
“ Our expectation is that it will be a bold transformative tax reform . That would mean a dramatic corporate rate cut , an aggressive stripping out of set-asides and special interest carve-outs and simplification , ” said Tim Phillips , president of Americans for Prosperity , a political group backed by billionaire conservatives Charles and David Koch .
White House spokeswoman Natalie Strom declined to comment on the blueprint . “ We have always said that tax reform will include lowering rates , closing loopholes and broadening the base by ending special interest tax breaks . Those priorities will be reflected in the plan , ” she said .
The Big Six will likely address the estimated $ 2.6 trillion in U.S. corporate profits held overseas by requiring companies to bring the money home at rates of 3.5 percent for reinvested profits and 8.75 percent for on cash and equivalents , lobbyists said .

The “Big Six” team of Republican tax policy makers is expected to release a plan on Wednesday targeting tax cuts for businesses, but offering few clues about how to replace reduced federal revenues, said lobbyists and congressional sources.

Under pressure from corporate America, the team is expected to call for a corporate income tax target rate possibly within a range of 18-23 percent, down from the current rate of 35 percent.

But the Big Six, which includes top Trump aides and congressional Republican leaders, is expected to refrain from cutting the top individual tax rate of 39.6 percent, in a risky step that many Republicans in the House of Representatives could find hard to swallow.

“They’re not going to cut the highest income tax rate. They’re not,” predicted Stephen Moore, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank. Moore helped write Trump’s campaign tax plan.

Overhauling the tax code was a key pledge for Trump in his 2016 presidential campaign. But after eight months in office, he has made only limited progress. Washington has achieved no major tax overhaul since 1986.

Trump portrays lower corporate taxes as a boon to workers, saying they would lead to more jobs and higher salaries. A rate cut on corporate profits could also be used to benefit shareholders and to offer up more executive bonuses, however.

“The details leaking out of the Big Six meetings paint a clear picture of an unprecedented tax giveaway for the most fortunate and biggest corporations,” Senator Ron Wyden, top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said this week.

The Big Six — Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and two tax committee chairmen — have been working on their plan for months.

But they are still undecided on key issues, including whether to let businesses write off new investments immediately; how to lower tax rates for small businesses; and whether to cut middle-class taxes simply by doubling the standard deduction for individuals and families, according to lobbyists.

Resolving such issues will help determine how aggressively Republicans can cut corporate taxes.

Lobbyists said they do not expect the Big Six to offer many details about the tax loopholes and deductions that could be eliminated to help pay for tax cuts.

“Our expectation is that it will be a bold transformative tax reform. That would mean a dramatic corporate rate cut, an aggressive stripping out of set-asides and special interest carve-outs and simplification,” said Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, a political group backed by billionaire conservatives Charles and David Koch.

White House spokeswoman Natalie Strom declined to comment on the blueprint. “We have always said that tax reform will include lowering rates, closing loopholes and broadening the base by ending special interest tax breaks. Those priorities will be reflected in the plan,” she said.

The Big Six will likely address the estimated $2.6 trillion in U.S. corporate profits held overseas by requiring companies to bring the money home at rates of 3.5 percent for reinvested profits and 8.75 percent for on cash and equivalents, lobbyists said.

To offset lost revenue, the Trump administration plans to forecast a flood of new tax revenue in coming years, based on aggressive assumptions of tax-fueled economic expansion.

But Senate Republicans have shown signs of moving away from such “dynamic” scoring of any tax legislation impact.

Tom Coburn , Oklahoma Republican and Congress ‘ chief waste-watcher . “ Before we ask taxpayers to send even more of their own money to Washington , we must do more to prevent these egregious examples of waste . ”
The IRS said it does try to crack down on bad EITC payments . Americans who claim the tax credit are already audited at twice the rate of other taxpayers .

Boehner to avert the worst of the year-end tax increases and spending cuts , Social Security payments might be lower in the future for millions of Americans .
On Tuesday , Democrats and Republicans were examining a multitrillion-dollar deficit reduction package put forward by the president , though the two sides were trading barbed remarks and aides were emphasizing that nothing was final until the whole deal was done .
But the White House seemed willing to make a concession to Republicans with a switch in the formula that ensures that Social Security payments keep up with the pace of inflation — an idea that immediately proved unpopular with its liberal base .
“ Any talk of shrinking the program to save money is flawed from the start because Social Security is not part of the national budget in the same way as military spending , ” Representative Raúl M. Grijalva of Arizona said in a statement . “ It ’ s paid for through a dedicated payroll tax separate from general budgeting . ”
Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York was among many on the left who echoed that sentiment . “ Everyone has a grandparent , a friend or a neighbor who relies on the Social Security benefits they earned to pay for medical care , food and housing , ” he said in a statement . “ A move towards chained Consumer Price Index would be a long-term benefit cut for every single person who receives a Social Security check . ”
Democrats and Republicans are considering switching Social Security payment adjustments to a “ chained ” Consumer Price Index . The Consumer Price Index tracks the price of a basket of commonly purchased household goods . A chained index accounts for consumers ’ tendency to substitute similar items for one another as prices fluctuate . A consumer might buy more apples when the price of oranges increases , for instance .
Though it sounds like nothing more than a technical fix , adopting a chained index would squeeze benefits over time . The chained index ends up , in a given year , about 0.3 percentage points lower than the unchained index . That difference accumulates , so after five years , it might be 1.5 percentage points lower . Using a chained index would cut Social Security spending by about $ 112 billion over a decade , according to an estimate by the Congressional Budget Office .
AARP , the lobbying and research group for older Americans , immediately criticized the proposal . “ We would rather see a broader discussion addressing retirement security , ” said Debra Whitman , an executive vice president at AARP . “ We object to the context in which it ’ s being discussed , which is a few weeks before Christmas , without people understanding what the change really means . ”
Because the payment reductions would accumulate over time , AARP and other groups argue that they would hit the oldest Americans disproportionately hard . They might also unduly burden women , who tend to live longer than men , and the lowest-income older people , who are most dependent on Social Security checks , the groups warned .
Some economists and policy experts have also argued that both the current and the chained indexes underestimate the inflation that older Americans experience . The government produces an experimental “ elderly index , ” for instance , that tries to capture the consumption habits of people over 62 more accurately than other measures . For instance , older people buy more health care and less education than the average family , so the elderly index puts more weight on the former and less on the latter .
In no small part because of spiraling health care costs , inflation as measured by the elderly index has grown faster than inflation as calculated by the standard index that Social Security uses . That implies that the purchasing power of Social Security payments linked to a chained index would erode more over time , given what older Americans buy .
Still , other economists and policy experts from across the political spectrum have argued that a chained index is a more accurate measure of the inflation that households actually experience , and therefore is a better policy tool . They note that the elderly index is still experimental , and that not just older people receive or spend Social Security payments .
“ We know that the current measure of inflation is not adequately measuring experienced inflation , and we should hence go with the better measure , ” said Christian E. Weller , a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress , a liberal research group based in Washington , and the author of a plan to modernize Social Security .
Both liberals and conservatives have at times argued against making changes to Social Security outside the context of a broader overhaul . Many analysts — particularly Democrats — argue that Social Security does not contribute to long-term deficits because it has its own financing stream in payroll taxes .

You can ’ t do that anymore , mathematically . We could provide decent benefits for the rich and the poor by raising taxes a lot , but we need to raise taxes for other things . ”

“ He seemed flexible , but he said taxes should go up on the top 2 percent , ” said one executive who did not want to be named . Most of the executives said they were not opposed to tax increases as part of a deal but stressed that a quick resolution could help the economy .
White House officials rejected Republican suggestions that Mr. Obama has not been serious enough about tackling the growth of entitlement spending . “ He is committed , every time he talks about this , to a balanced approach that includes both , you know , revenues , spending cuts and savings through entitlement reforms , ” said Jay Carney , the White House press secretary .
White House officials pointed to $ 340 billion in health care entitlement program savings and $ 272 billion in reductions to other mandatory programs over 10 years in a previous presidential budget proposal . “ Even though that budget proposal ’ s been out there for a long time , a lot of people aren ’ t aware of that , ” Mr. Carney said . “ He called it “ another piece of evidence that the president has been willing to make tough choices . ”
One reason a lot of people may not be aware of the cuts Mr. Obama has proposed is that he does not talk about them often . In his first postelection news conference , he focused on tax increases on the wealthy and used the term “ spending cuts ” just once without elaborating .
By focusing on taxes , Mr. Obama has put Republicans on the defensive . At Wednesday ’ s event , he challenged them to extend Bush-era tax cuts for family income under $ 250,000 since both sides agree those should continue . Doing so would effectively mean tax cuts on income over $ 250,000 would expire at the end of the year since Mr. Obama would not sign a separate bill extending them .
The president ’ s public lobbying seemed to crack through the solid Republican opposition this week when a prominent conservative , Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma , urged his party to seek such a quick deal with Mr. Obama extending middle-class tax cuts . Mr. Boehner pushed back against Mr. Cole on Wednesday , saying that would hurt small businesses and the economy .
At the same time , Mr. Obama evidently sees no percentage in talking in detail about spending cuts , acutely aware that his liberal base is unenthusiastic about paring back entitlement programs . Senator Richard J. Durbin , a longtime Illinois ally and the No . 2 Senate Democrat , said this week that Medicare , Medicaid and Social Security should not be part of current budget talks .
As the two sides continued to shadowbox , Mr. Bowles was skeptical , putting the chances of a deal by the end of the year at one in three . “ I believe the probability is that we are going over the cliff , ” he said , “ and I think that will be horrible . ”","After meeting with White House officials this week, Mr. Bowles said he believed “they were serious about reducing spending” but added that “we need to talk more about the spending side of the equation.”

Republican leaders were more scathing, saying the president was more interested in campaigning than sitting down to resolve difficult issues. They said they were willing to raise tax revenue by closing loopholes and limiting deductions, but Mr. Obama has not reciprocated with more restraint of entitlement programs.

“We have not seen any good-faith effort on the part of this administration to talk about the real problem that we’re trying to fix,” said Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia , the House majority leader. “This has to be a part of this agreement or else we just continue to dig the hole deeper, asking folks to allow us to kick the can down the road further. And that we don’t want to do.”

Although Mr. Obama has not scheduled a new meeting with Congressional leaders, he will dispatch top advisers to Capitol Hill for talks on Thursday. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and Rob Nabors, the White House legislative director, will pay separate visits to Senators Harry Reid of Nevada and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , the Democratic and Republican leaders, and Representatives John A. Boehner of Ohio and Nancy Pelosi of California , the Republican speaker and Democratic minority leader.

Not only would delayed rate reductions reduce the revenue cost but it would also help spur growth more . Here ’ s why .

So if new investments are better off with staged reductions in corporate tax rates , why would the government collect more revenue ? The answer is that U.S. businesses expected their income from past investments will be taxed at a federal 35 per cent tax rate but all of sudden they will enjoy an unexpected gain with a reduction in the tax rate to 20 per cent on income generated from pre-tax reform investments . This windfall gain is reduced by slowing down the tax rate reductions .

This simple idea of staging rate reductions also gives more room for the inevitable trade-offs required to make tax reform work . I estimate that the House plan will result in a sharp rise in corporate investment as the effective corporate tax rate on capital will precipitously decline from 34.6 to 18.3 per cent .

taxes,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/2017/10/17/16479864/republican-path-tax-reform,The 4 steps Republicans have to take to pass tax reform,2017-10-17,"Tara Golshan, German Lopez, Brian Resnick, Aaron Rupar","Congress narrowly passed its budget Thursday , a key step in giving the GOP a green light to pass a tax bill with only Republicans votes .
In other words , Republicans , eager for a legislative win on taxes by the end of the year , are officially at the starting line to aggressively begin negotiations on tax reform .
But there is still a long road ahead . President Donald Trump says he will sign “ maybe the biggest tax cut we 've ever had , ” and top Republicans keep pledging he will do it by Christmas . He has promised he will help the middle class , make the United States more competitive internationally , and bring almost unprecedented economic growth in the years to come . And he ’ s promised to eliminate the federal debt in eight years while he ’ s at it .
Satisfying every one of those promises is politically impossible , but even coming anywhere close to it in the next two months will be extremely difficult . Though congressional Republicans are saying tax reform will be “ easier ” than health care , the party is already embroiled in an intraparty struggle over how deeply to cut rates — and how to pay for them . And despite months of negotiations between top House and Senate Congress members and members of Trump ’ s administration — a working group dubbed the “ Big Six ” — Republicans haven ’ t actually agreed on many important points . And what they have agreed on has already raised some eyebrows within the Republicans conference .
“ When you have a very slim majority — three of four senators ... control the destiny of tax reform and [ that ’ s ] just unacceptable for the American people , ” Rep. Jim Renacci ( R-OH ) , who sits on the tax-focused House Ways and Means and Budget committees , said .
Overcoming these hurdles will be difficult , and the margin of error for Republicans is slim.Here ’ s a clear guide to what Republicans need to do .
Phase 1 : before cutting taxes , Republicans need to pass a budget ( Done . )
Like their strategy with Obamacare repeal , congressional Republicans are planning to pass their tax plan through a congressional loophole — “ budget reconciliation ” — which allows Congress to pass bills with a simple majority ( 51 votes ) and bypass the threat of a Democratic filibuster .
To pass anything through budget reconciliation , Republicans needed to pass a budget resolution — a nonbinding agreement that establishes “ instructions ” for reconciliation bills . These instructions give Republicans a green light to move a tax bill and , depending on how strictly they are written , can also dictate how deeply Republicans can cut tax rates .
Republicans in both the House and Senate have now passed the same budget — narrowly . The reconciliation instructions only mandated savings for one committee : $ 1 billion from the Natural Resources Committee . It ’ s rumored this will likely come from a bill to allow drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge . Notably the budget did not mandate spending cuts to reduce the deficit , instead allowing for a $ 1.5 trillion increase to the deficit over the next 10 years .
In other words , this budget gives Republicans the freedom to make deep tax cuts without having to pay for them .
The $ 1.5 trillion deficit increase prompted some to vote against the budget altogether . In the Senate , there was only one holdout , Sen. Rand Paul ( R-KY ) who opposed the budget resolution because of its impact on the deficit — the budget ’ s proposal for defense spending was too high , he said .
But in the House there were 20 Republicans who voted against the resolution . Some of these “ no ” votes were over the deficit , but most were representatives from New York and New Jersey , in a symbolic vote against the state of tax reform negotiations themselves .
In late September , Republicans in the House and Senate released a vague framework — which calls for a substantial cut to the corporate tax rate , a huge expansion of the standard deduction , and a collapse of individual tax rates into three tax brackets instead of the current seven . ( They have also proposed a possible fourth top tax bracket . ) But within that framework , there is a lot Republicans don ’ t agree on .
The GOP has a general idea to cut tax rates and somehow pay for them by getting rid of deductions , loopholes and benefits . But as ███ ’ s Andrew Prokop explained , Republicans are having a hard time deciding which loopholes , deductions , and benefits they are willing to do away with .
Already there are signs of Republican defections from the framework alone . Retiring Sen. Bob Corker ( R-TN ) said he wont vote for anything that will add a `` penny '' to the deficit ( though he left the door open to some rosy economic projections called “ dynamic scoring ” ) and Sen. Rand Paul ( R-KY ) has signaled he won ’ t vote for a plan that he thinks hurts the middle class .
But proposed plans to pay for the tax cut aren ’ t seeing much traction . For example , the state and local tax deduction ( SALT ) , which allows Americans to write off their property and state income taxes , already has Republican members from mostly Democratic states like New York , California , and New Jersey grumbling .
Already a number of Republican representatives from New Jersey and New York voted against the budget for this reason — an early signal of a major debate ahead .
According to the Tax Policy Center , a full repeal of SALT would raise $ 1.3 trillion in revenue over the next decade — which would go a long way for Republicans who are limited in how much they can blow a hole in the deficit . Now there are rumors of a rolled-back SALT , which might be easier for moderate Republicans to swallow .
And Trump isn ’ t making any of this easier . He has been relatively incoherent on the specific policy goals of tax reform and instead has set lofty expectations that Congress will likely fail to achieve .
Most recently , reports indicated that Trump grew angry when he learned the tax framework would negatively impact the middle class — a complaint similar to that of his newfound golfing buddy Rand Paul — and allegedly called for some adjustments to the framework .
Phase 3 : actually go through regular order — or so they say
Now Republicans have managed to agree on and pass a budget , they have find some consensus , they have to actually write and pass their tax bill . Though technically Republicans have until the end of the next fiscal year — September 30 , 2018 — to pass this tax reform with the set of reconciliation instructions set up by the House and Senate budgets , they have said they ’ re going to get this done by the end of this year .
Rep. Kevin Brady ( R-TX ) , who chairs the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee , said the full Republican tax plan wouldn ’ t be unveiled until after the House and Senate agreed on a budget , putting more of a squeeze on the calendar . Now , the House says it will release their bill on Nov. 1 .
House and Senate leadership has promised that tax reform will go through the full committee treatment , especially after the closed-door process for Obamacare repeal ultimately led some Republicans to vote against the health bill altogether earlier this year .
In the House , this will be the charge of Brady ’ s Ways and Means Committee , and in the Senate , Orrin Hatch ( R-UT ) will be the chief tax reform negotiator in the Finance Committee .

Or one chamber could simply take the other chamber ’ s bill and pass it .
Phase 4 : get this bill through the Senate ’ s obscure budget rules — which is the really hard part
At some point after Republicans reconcile their differences and fend off enough outside interests to actually write a bill , the Congressional Budget Office and the Senate parliamentarian are going to have to weigh in on this whole process — a step that could completely derail Republicans ’ efforts .
Because Republicans are adamant about driving a partisan-led tax reform effort through budget reconciliation , they are not allowed to increase the deficit outside the first 10-year window , according to Senate rules .
They could pass sweeping tax cuts that will sunset after 10 years . This is what former President George W.

Republicans , given all the pressures on this bill , might be forced to do the same . They could pass much smaller tax cuts that are permanent . If Republicans decided that making tax cuts permanent is more of priority than deeply slashing the rates , they could theoretically find enough revenue raisers and offsets to pass permanent — bust substantially smaller — tax cuts . It ’ s unlikely conservatives will sign up for this . Already House Freedom Caucus Chair Rep. Mark Meadows ( R-NC ) has drawn a red line at the 20 percent corporate tax rate . Anything above that means it ’ s likely a lot of conservative members won ’ t vote for the bill . Technically , Republicans could also split up their tax bill into three separate titles : One would be a temporary Republican-led effort that would pursue aggressive tax cuts and have to sunset in 10 years ; a second would be permanent and comply with Senate rules ; and the third would be a permanent bipartisan proposal needing 60 votes and likely find consensus around issues like the child tax credit . By going this route , Republicans would be able to split the impact of the deficit between budget reconciliation bills and regular order . Some analysts have also floated the nuclear option , in which McConnell just overrules the Senate parliamentarian . McConnell did not do this in the health care debate , but some have theorized there is more pressure for him to go to extreme lengths this time . Along these lines , the Senate Budget Committee could also use a different , more ideologically conservative score of their tax plan instead of the CBO ’ s evaluation .

In any scenario , they will be relying on projections of increased economic growth from tax cuts to offset the revenue losses from those cuts , known as “ dynamic scoring. ” But even under the rosiest of projections , growth alone won ’ t be enough to offset the full losses from the deepest cuts Republicans have proposed . A large contingent of economists — and even some Republicans themselves — have already called these growth projections unrealistic . Many are skeptical whether the Senate Parliamentarian will accept those growth numbers .

Whichever path they chose , however , there will be roadblocks ahead .","Congress narrowly passed its budget Thursday, a key step in giving the GOP a green light to pass a tax bill with only Republicans votes.

In other words, Republicans, eager for a legislative win on taxes by the end of the year, are officially at the starting line to aggressively begin negotiations on tax reform.

But there is still a long road ahead. President Donald Trump says he will sign “maybe the biggest tax cut we've ever had,” and top Republicans keep pledging he will do it by Christmas. He has promised he will help the middle class, make the United States more competitive internationally, and bring almost unprecedented economic growth in the years to come. And he’s promised to eliminate the federal debt in eight years while he’s at it.

Satisfying every one of those promises is politically impossible, but even coming anywhere close to it in the next two months will be extremely difficult. Though congressional Republicans are saying tax reform will be “easier” than health care, the party is already embroiled in an intraparty struggle over how deeply to cut rates — and how to pay for them. And despite months of negotiations between top House and Senate Congress members and members of Trump’s administration — a working group dubbed the “Big Six” — Republicans haven’t actually agreed on many important points. And what they have agreed on has already raised some eyebrows within the Republicans conference.

“When you have a very slim majority — three of four senators ... control the destiny of tax reform and [that’s] just unacceptable for the American people,” Rep. Jim Renacci (R-OH), who sits on the tax-focused House Ways and Means and Budget committees, said.

Overcoming these hurdles will be difficult, and the margin of error for Republicans is slim.Here’s a clear guide to what Republicans need to do.

Phase 1: before cutting taxes, Republicans need to pass a budget (Done.)

The most important number for congressional Republicans is 51.

Like their strategy with Obamacare repeal, congressional Republicans are planning to pass their tax plan through a congressional loophole — “budget reconciliation” — which allows Congress to pass bills with a simple majority (51 votes) and bypass the threat of a Democratic filibuster.

To pass anything through budget reconciliation, Republicans needed to pass a budget resolution — a nonbinding agreement that establishes “instructions” for reconciliation bills. These instructions give Republicans a green light to move a tax bill and, depending on how strictly they are written, can also dictate how deeply Republicans can cut tax rates.

Republicans in both the House and Senate have now passed the same budget — narrowly. The reconciliation instructions only mandated savings for one committee: $1 billion from the Natural Resources Committee. It’s rumored this will likely come from a bill to allow drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Notably the budget did not mandate spending cuts to reduce the deficit, instead allowing for a $1.5 trillion increase to the deficit over the next 10 years.

In other words, this budget gives Republicans the freedom to make deep tax cuts without having to pay for them.

The $1.5 trillion deficit increase prompted some to vote against the budget altogether. In the Senate, there was only one holdout, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) who opposed the budget resolution because of its impact on the deficit — the budget’s proposal for defense spending was too high, he said.

But in the House there were 20 Republicans who voted against the resolution. Some of these “no” votes were over the deficit, but most were representatives from New York and New Jersey, in a symbolic vote against the state of tax reform negotiations themselves.

Phase 2: overcome key policy disagreements

In late September, Republicans in the House and Senate released a vague framework — which calls for a substantial cut to the corporate tax rate, a huge expansion of the standard deduction, and a collapse of individual tax rates into three tax brackets instead of the current seven. (They have also proposed a possible fourth top tax bracket.) But within that framework, there is a lot Republicans don’t agree on.

The GOP has a general idea to cut tax rates and somehow pay for them by getting rid of deductions, loopholes and benefits. But as Vox’s Andrew Prokop explained, Republicans are having a hard time deciding which loopholes, deductions, and benefits they are willing to do away with.

Already there are signs of Republican defections from the framework alone. Retiring Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) said he wont vote for anything that will add a ""penny"" to the deficit (though he left the door open to some rosy economic projections called “dynamic scoring”) and Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) has signaled he won’t vote for a plan that he thinks hurts the middle class.

But proposed plans to pay for the tax cut aren’t seeing much traction. For example, the state and local tax deduction (SALT), which allows Americans to write off their property and state income taxes, already has Republican members from mostly Democratic states like New York, California, and New Jersey grumbling.

Already a number of Republican representatives from New Jersey and New York voted against the budget for this reason — an early signal of a major debate ahead.

According to the Tax Policy Center, a full repeal of SALT would raise $1.3 trillion in revenue over the next decade — which would go a long way for Republicans who are limited in how much they can blow a hole in the deficit. Now there are rumors of a rolled-back SALT, which might be easier for moderate Republicans to swallow.

And Trump isn’t making any of this easier. He has been relatively incoherent on the specific policy goals of tax reform and instead has set lofty expectations that Congress will likely fail to achieve.

Most recently, reports indicated that Trump grew angry when he learned the tax framework would negatively impact the middle class — a complaint similar to that of his newfound golfing buddy Rand Paul — and allegedly called for some adjustments to the framework.

At some point after Republicans reconcile their differences and fend off enough outside interests to actually write a bill, the Congressional Budget Office and the Senate parliamentarian are going to have to weigh in on this whole process — a step that could completely derail Republicans’ efforts.

Because Republicans are adamant about driving a partisan-led tax reform effort through budget reconciliation, they are not allowed to increase the deficit outside the first 10-year window, according to Senate rules.

This rule basically leaves Republicans with four options:

They could pass sweeping tax cuts that will sunset after 10 years. This is what former President George W. Bush did with his tax cuts under budget reconciliation in 2001, essentially getting around the deficit restriction by making the tax cuts temporary. Republicans, given all the pressures on this bill, might be forced to do the same. They could pass much smaller tax cuts that are permanent.

That's my refund?

Americans love their tax refunds – even if they give the federal government interest-free loans for the year by having too much withheld in each of their paychecks. Many prefer the money returned to them as a big check in the spring. The forced savings helps them preserve a predictable windfall, one they can’t dip into during the year.

Past taxpayer surveys show they use that money to reduce debt, pad savings or pay for a vacation or other large purchases. Overall, about three-fourths of taxpayers get a refund, which last year averaged just under $3,000.

Jennifer and Daniel Yuen planned to use their refund to support their oldest daughter, who moved to Washington, D.C., to train with the Washington Ballet. The couple pay for her tuition and rent.

Last year, they got almost $800 back. This year, they owe more than $5,000 – a major burden for the Chicago couple.

“We’re strapped,” said Jennifer, a special-education teacher. ""That's three to four months of my daughter’s rent or half of her tuition.”

Instead, they are considering a payment plan with the IRS because they can't afford to write such a big check. Those extra monthly payments will dent other plans they had for this year, too.

“This will put off the car that was supposed to replace our 11-year-old one,"" Jennifer said.

Who owes taxes?

Jennifer says the elimination of the unreimbursed employee expenses deduction hit their taxes hard. Both she and her husband, who is a stagehand, often spend their own money on job supplies – all of which used to be tax-deductible.

“That's what really killed us,"" she said.

The Yuens fit the profile of those taxpayers most at risk for smaller refunds or owing the government, Ebel said.

Homeowners in high tax states, employees with a lot of unreimbursed expenses and people who itemize with no dependents all could experience an unpleasant tax season.

Kathleen Trisdale expected to owe something this year. “Maybe a few hundred dollars,” said the resident of California, a state with high taxes.

“I’m a low-income person so I didn’t think I would be affected this much.” Kathleen Trisdale, a taxpayer in California

Instead, she owes more than $2,000, a hardship for the disabled veteran, who depends on her military pension and Social Security for income.

“I actually had to take out a signature loan from my credit union to pay my taxes and had to increase my monthly deductions by $300 to make sure I'm not hit hard next year,” Trisdale said. “So not only am I hit with this tax hike, I am now more in debt and I have less income at my disposal each month.”

She’s not entirely sure why her taxes ended up this way. She noticed that she couldn’t deduct her college tuition and other school expenses. She’s pursuing a four-year degree in environmental science and management.

Trisdale, 54, also couldn’t write off the interest she paid on her mortgage because she took the standard deduction.

She plans to see a tax professional for help, “which will cost me even more,” she said. ""I’m a low-income person so I didn’t think I would be affected this much.”

Withholding math

In large part, those who owe money to the federal government aren't necessarily paying more in taxes after the major changes to the tax law. In fact, four in five taxpayers are estimated to get a tax cut, according to the Tax Policy Center.

But if you didn’t change your paycheck withholdings – which most taxpayers didn't do – your tax savings were doled out during the year in each paycheck, reducing or eliminating your refund.

“When we compared withholdings of people on file, September 2017 versus September 2018, it was largely unchanged,” said Pete Isberg, head of government affairs at ADP, a payroll and HR services provider. “Generally, few employees changed their withholdings.”

Workers may have not noticed any changes to their paychecks either, Isberg said, because their 2018 paychecks not only included the tax law changes, but also any changes to their other benefits, such as healthcare premiums.

“So, net-net they may not have seen an increase,” he said.

Adjusted withholdings, but not enough

Diana Hansen didn't want to take any chances on her refund that she planned to use for a trip to Bermuda this year to celebrate her 25th anniversary with her husband. Aside from her typical withholdings, Hansen – an executive administrative assistant – had $100 more taken out of each paycheck.

It still wasn't enough. The couple – who normally gets $1,000 to $3,000 back – owes $4,200 in federal taxes.

Diana thinks the $10,000 cap on the state and local tax deduction is largely to blame. Fortunately, the couple has enough in savings to pay in one lump sum.

“You get your savings to a certain level that you have a buffer, and then this happens.” Diana Hansen, a taxpayer in New Jersey

“But it kills me,"" she said. ""You get your savings to a certain level that you have a buffer, and then this happens.""

She and her husband will still go to Bermuda and, in the meantime, are adjusting their withholdings for next year. So far, she's taking out an additional $150 from her paycheck, but could do more if needed.

“Our taxes are sitting right here,” she said. “I haven’t signed them and won’t until the very end.”

Actually paying more in taxes

In some ways, Stephanie Harris is one of the luckier ones. The 53-year-old actuary in Pittsburgh is still getting a refund, but it’s about half of what it usually is. Even so, she is one of the five percent of filers that the Tax Policy Center estimated would end up paying more in federal taxes following the changes to the tax law.

“In the past five years, my effective tax rate has been as low as 6.13 percent and as a high as 8.43 percent,” she said. “This year, my effective tax rate was 9.38 percent, the highest it’s ever been.”

A small percentage of US taxpayers would see a tax increase ( disproportionately , these would be higher-income itemizers from high-tax states ) , and a number of deductions that help certain people with heavy medical expenses and student loan debt would be eliminated ( proponents say much or all of the resulting blow would be mitigated by lower rates and a doubled standard deduction ) . Second , among the `` losers '' would be a small percentage of middle class families and filers . Third , even using a `` dynamic '' score of the legislation -- which takes into account the growth-stimulating effects of tax cuts and simplification -- it is likely that the plan would add hundreds of billions to cumulative federal deficits over the next decade . The debt matters . Fourth , some Republicans believe the plan is too tilted toward corporate tax reductions ( the current US statuary and effective rates are internationally uncompetitive ) , arguing that a small portion of those planned cuts should be redirected to families with children .
There is partisan retort to each of those first three criticisms , of course : The Democratic Party lied to the American people by promising a no-lose panacea under Obamacare , which ended up harming more people than it helped , while gut-punching millions of middle class families with skyrocketing Obamacare costs and taxes . And Obama 's party , now feigning suddenly concern about deficits , cheered loudly as he nearly doubled the national debt in the span of just eight years . These points highlight Democrats ' hypocrisy and opportunism ; they do not , however , invalidate the concerns listed above , on the merits . The fundamental question as Senators contemplate their chamber 's legislation is whether the drawbacks of the bill outweigh its benefits . I believe they do not , but in order to at least reach a point of forming rational opinions , it 's imperative that we expose and correct dishonest myths about the effects of tax reform . These are the two biggest falsehoods being propagated by the Left :
( 1 ) The GOP tax reform proposals do not help the middle class . This is flat-out wrong , period . As we 've explored in great detail , with links to actual data , the vast majority of all taxpayers would receive a tax cut under the Republican plan , including roughly 75 percent of middle income households ( others would see no change , and a small fraction would see an increase ) . This is especially true for the massive majority of middle class filers who take the standard deduction , which is set to roughly increase twofold under the legislation . As we wrote earlier , even the New York Times ' analysis of the bill -- evidently unread by the paper 's editorial board -- can not escape the empirical fact that a lopsided supermajority of middle class earners stand to benefit from tax relief . I 've also cited two nonpartisan analyses of the House-passed bill that determined it would lower taxes and increase incomes , on average , across every income group in America ( see the above links ) . In doing so , I 've highlighted the work of the nonpartisan Tax Foundation to illustrate these benefits , which some liberals have dismissed because of that organization 's reputation for leaning to the right . For the purposes of this argument , therefore , let 's look at findings from the ideologically liberal Tax Policy Center ( TPC ) . It found that the House-passed legislation would reduce average tax bills across all five income groups from 2019 to 2027 ( the end of the budget window ) . How about the Senate bill ?
Chart from left-leaning Tax Policy Center shows Senate GOP reform bill would INCREASE after-tax incomes in '19 & '25 for * every single * income group . Yellow bar ( '27 projection ) assumes highly implausible total expiration of middle class cuts ( see now-permanent Bush tax cuts ) : pic.twitter.com/7268PrtWlH — Guy Benson ( @ guypbenson ) November 30 , 2017
The blue and red bars demonstrate how taxpayers in every single income quintile , including the middle three , will see their after-tax incomes rise , due to the plan 's tax cuts -- both immediately and in the medium-term . As I mention in the tweet , the yellow bar ( the basis for nearly all of the misleading scare-mongering you 're hearing from the Left on this front ) assumes that Congress would allow all of the middle class cuts to expire after 2025 . I 've previously elucidated why that outcome is unlikely in the extreme , but here 's Manhattan Institute Senior Fellow Brian Riedl fortifying the case persuasively and succinctly . Please read every sentence of this paragraph carefully , as it 's packed with relevant information :
A Tax Policy Center analysis of the Senate bill reveals that three-quarters of all families would get a tax cut . Just 12 percent would see a tax increase — and they are concentrated among the rich . The average middle-income family would receive a tax cut of approximately $ 850 per year through 2025 . At that point , Congress would have to vote to extend most of the family tax cuts . This vote would probably be a formality , as a similar vote five years ago to extend the Bush tax cuts for middle-class families passed the Senate 89–8 . There is no appetite in Congress to steeply raise middle-class taxes . Even in the worst-case scenario , where the cuts fully expire , the typical middle-income family would receive a cumulative $ 7,000 tax cut in the early years , followed by a ( roughly ) $ 100 annual tax increase later . Still a good deal . How do critics portray this as a middle-class tax hike ? By simply ignoring the $ 7,000 tax cut in the early years , assuming a full expiration after 2025 , and then implying that the later tax hike is much larger . That is flat-out dishonest .
( 2 ) The GOP tax reform proposals are just another giveaway to `` the rich . '' President Trump insisted that millionaires and billionaires not see their income tax rate slashed under the GOP plan , and he got his way in the House-passed bill ( the Senate bill would reduce the top tax bracket rate by just one point ) . That still has n't stopped the Left from endlessly repeating their favorite talking point about any and every Republican tax idea ever proposed . First , I 'll remind you that `` the rich '' already pay a disproportionately high percentage of America 's tax tab . The data spells out how they contribute their `` fair share '' ( another popular buzz phrase ) , and then some . Of course an across-the-board tax cut and reform plan will benefit many of the people who are shoveling mounds of cash out the door and into Uncle Sam 's bottomless coffers . But can the Senate plan be broadly construed as a sweetheart deal for the very rich ? Back to Riedl 's analysis -- which , again , is rooted in numbers from the liberal TPC :
Even a proportional tax cut will save wealthier families more money . In 2013 ( the latest year for which data are available ) , the typical family in the top 1 percent paid $ 420,000 in federal income taxes . The top 20 percent averaged $ 47,000 , and the typical middle-income family paid $ 2,000 . The bottom 40 percent collectively paid zero income tax . It is not easy to give the largest income-tax cuts to those who already pay no income tax . That said , the Senate bill would make the tax code even more progressive . The bottom 80 percent of families currently pay 33 percent of all combined federal taxes , yet would get 37 percent of the tax cuts . By contrast , the top 1 percent currently pays 27 percent of all federal taxes but would get just 18 percent of the tax cuts . The result would be wealthy families paying a larger portion of the federal tax burden .
So where do statistics like this `` 62 percent of cuts to the top one percent '' assertion come from ?
“ Your tax plan has 36 % of it going to the richest 1 % in America . I don ’ t do that '' is a thing McCain said in 2000 to GWBush . McCain went on to vote against both the 2001 & 2003 Bush cuts .
Well , current Senate bill has 62 % of cuts going to top 1 % . https : //t.co/houHwoEcPb — Catherine Rampell ( @ crampell ) November 29 , 2017
That data point relies on the `` yellow bar '' assumption described earlier . She skips the entire part about undisputed middle class tax cuts over the next eight years , and jumps to a fictional 2027 universe in which Congress has green-lit a big tax increase on the middle class , leaving the remaining playing field slanted toward `` the rich . '' This is misleading sleight-of-hand that looks intended to fool gullible people and whip up under-informed outrage . Another example of that phenomenon :

Using basic arithmetic , many people might conclude this also means that 38 percent of Americans would see a tax increase . Wrong :
This does n't say nearly what you think it says . Roughly 1/3 of filers have no tax liability , so roughly 1/3 of filers getting no tax cut is not at all surprising . There 's no tax to cut . https : //t.co/gfRuvkt3ld — amoylan ( @ amoylan ) November 30 , 2017
To recap : The data proves that the overwhelming majority of all taxpayers ( including , if not especially , the middle class ) would get a tax cut under the bill , which would also significantly improve the US business climate for corporations and small businesses , resulting in faster economic growth and nearly one million new full-time American jobs . What it would not do -- contrary to some of the scurrilous rumors and baseless claims flying around -- is create special new `` tax breaks '' for private jet owners , eliminate the popular mortgage interest deduction , or `` kick millions off of healthcare '' ( a distortion that doubles as a bogus claim that poor people would get slapped with `` tax increases '' under the legislation ) . I 'm not here to tell you the Republican plan is perfect . I 'm here to tell you that some of the most frequently-repeated attacks from the Left against the plan are either entirely unsupported by evidence , or rest on out-of-context data points that seem to have been deliberately cherry-picked in order to mislead people .","In the interest of intellectual honesty and transparency, let's begin with a few important concessions to skeptics of the GOP tax reform bill: First, not every single American would be a winner under the plan.

`` I care more about my country than I do about a 20-year-old pledge , '' Sen. Saxby Chambliss told Georgia television station WMAZ , a CNN affiliate , on Wednesday . `` If we do it his way , then we 'll continue in debt and I just have a disagreement with him about that . ''
Congress faces a year-end deadline to reach agreement on taming the U.S. budget deficit or take other steps to avert the so-called fiscal cliff of mandatory tax increases and spending cuts that experts say would push the country back into recession .
At the heart of budget standoff is disagreement over how to raise new revenues to help reduce red ink .
President Barack Obama and Senate Democrats call for an increase in tax rates for the wealthiest Americans , while House Republicans , who control that chamber 's majority , favor other approaches for bringing in money , such as closing certain tax loopholes and eliminating deductions .
Norquist , who heads the conservative group Americans for Tax Reform , has been successful over the years in lobbying a strong majority of congressional Republicans to sign his pledge to not raise taxes .
Many GOP candidates who ran for office also signed the promise , but earlier this year , a small number of freshman lawmakers rejected the idea that they were bound to the document .
Chambliss , along with 38 other senators and 219 House members entering the next Congress , have signed the pledge , according to the website for Americans for Tax Reform .
But Chambliss , who has previously criticized Norquist 's stronghold on anti-tax sentiments , said this week that the fiscal conservative 's ideas stand in the way of finding a solution for ballooning debt .
`` Norquist has no plan to pay this debt down , '' said Chambliss , who is up for re-election in 2014 .
The anti-tax crusader has said he predicts congressional Republicans will stand firm and negotiate a deal that excludes tax hikes .
Asked if Chambliss is concerned Norquist may use his resources to combat a re-election bid , the senator said , `` In all likelihood , yes . ''
`` But I do n't worry about that because I care too much about my country , '' he said . `` I care a lot more about it than I do Grover Norquist . ''
The two-term senator from Georgia added he 's `` willing to do the right thing and let the political consequences take care of themselves . ''","7 years ago

(CNN) – A top Republican U.S. senator brushed off the anti-tax pledge pushed by activist Grover Norquist and embraced widely for years by GOP lawmakers.

""I care more about my country than I do about a 20-year-old pledge,"" Sen. Saxby Chambliss told Georgia television station WMAZ, a CNN affiliate, on Wednesday. ""If we do it his way, then we'll continue in debt and I just have a disagreement with him about that.""

Congress faces a year-end deadline to reach agreement on taming the U.S. budget deficit or take other steps to avert the so-called fiscal cliff of mandatory tax increases and spending cuts that experts say would push the country back into recession.

At the heart of budget standoff is disagreement over how to raise new revenues to help reduce red ink.

President Barack Obama and Senate Democrats call for an increase in tax rates for the wealthiest Americans, while House Republicans, who control that chamber's majority, favor other approaches for bringing in money, such as closing certain tax loopholes and eliminating deductions.

Norquist, who heads the conservative group Americans for Tax Reform, has been successful over the years in lobbying a strong majority of congressional Republicans to sign his pledge to not raise taxes.

Many GOP candidates who ran for office also signed the promise, but earlier this year, a small number of freshman lawmakers rejected the idea that they were bound to the document.

Chambliss, along with 38 other senators and 219 House members entering the next Congress, have signed the pledge, according to the website for Americans for Tax Reform.

But Chambliss, who has previously criticized Norquist's stronghold on anti-tax sentiments, said this week that the fiscal conservative's ideas stand in the way of finding a solution for ballooning debt.

""Norquist has no plan to pay this debt down,"" said Chambliss, who is up for re-election in 2014.

The anti-tax crusader has said he predicts congressional Republicans will stand firm and negotiate a deal that excludes tax hikes.

Asked if Chambliss is concerned Norquist may use his resources to combat a re-election bid, the senator said, ""In all likelihood, yes.""

""But I don't worry about that because I care too much about my country,"" he said. ""I care a lot more about it than I do Grover Norquist.""

The two-term senator from Georgia added he's ""willing to do the right thing and let the political consequences take care of themselves.""

taxes,CNN (Web News),0,http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/15/news/economy/gop-tax-plan-details/index.html,What's in the GOP's final tax plan,2017-12-15,Jeanne Sahadi,"Both chambers of Congress have now passed the Republican tax overhaul bill on strictly party-line votes . It 's the first such overhaul in more than 30 years .
The tax overhaul -- which will affect all corners of the U.S. economy and everyone in it -- will have crossed the finish line in just 7 weeks since first being introduced .
The final bill still leans heavily toward tax cuts for corporations and business owners . But it also expands or restores some tax benefits for individuals relative to the earlier bills passed by the House and Senate .
The individual provisions would expire by the end of 2025 , but most of the corporate provisions would be permanent .
All told , the final bill includes trillions in tax cuts , most of which but not all are offset by revenue-raising measures . The bill on net would increase deficits by an estimated $ 1.46 trillion over a decade , according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation . That number would be much higher if , as Republicans assume , a future Congress does not allow the individual tax cuts to expire after 2025 .
With that , here 's a quick rundown of 16 key provisions in the final bill .
1 . Lowers ( many ) individual rates : The bill preserves seven tax brackets , but changes the rates that apply to : 10 % , 12 % , 22 % , 24 % , 32 % , 35 % and 37 % .
Today 's rates are 10 % , 15 % , 25 % , 28 % , 33 % , 35 % and 39.6 % .
Here 's how much income would apply to the new rates :
-- 10 % ( income up to $ 9,525 for individuals ; up to $ 19,050 for married couples filing jointly )
-- 12 % ( over $ 9,525 to $ 38,700 ; over $ 19,050 to $ 77,400 for couples )
-- 22 % ( over $ 38,700 to $ 82,500 ; over $ 77,400 to $ 165,000 for couples )
-- 24 % ( over $ 82,500 to $ 157,500 ; over $ 165,000 to $ 315,000 for couples )
-- 32 % ( over $ 157,500 to $ 200,000 ; over $ 315,000 to $ 400,000 for couples )
-- 35 % ( over $ 200,000 to $ 500,000 ; over $ 400,000 to $ 600,000 for couples )
2 . Nearly doubles the standard deduction : For single filers , the bill increases it to $ 12,000 from $ 6,350 currently ; for married couples filing jointly it increases to $ 24,000 from $ 12,700 .
The net effect : The percentage of filers who choose to itemize would drop sharply , since the only reason to do so is if your deductions exceed your standard deduction .
3 . Eliminates personal exemptions : Today you 're allowed to claim a $ 4,050 personal exemption for yourself , your spouse and each of your dependents . Doing so lowers your taxable income and thus your tax burden . The GOP tax plan eliminates that option .
For families with three or more kids , that could mute if not negate any tax relief they might get as a result of other provisions in the bill .
4 . Caps state and local tax deduction : The final bill will preserve the state and local tax deduction for anyone who itemizes , but it will cap the amount that may be deducted at $ 10,000 . Today the deduction is unlimited for your state and local property taxes plus income or sales taxes .
The SALT break has been on the book for more than a century . The original House and Senate GOP bills sought to repeal it entirely to help pay for the tax cuts , but that met with stiff resistance from lawmakers in high-tax states .
Residents in the vast majority of counties across the country claim an average SALT deduction below $ 10,000 , according to the Tax Foundation . So for low- and middle-income families who currently itemize because of their SALT deduction , they 're likely to take the much higher standard deduction under the bill if it becomes law , unless their total itemized deductions , including SALT , top $ 12,000 if single or $ 24,000 if married filing jointly .
Preserving the break -- albeit with a cap -- is likely to provide more help to higher income households in high-tax states .
5 . Expands child tax credit : The credit would be doubled to $ 2,000 for children under 17 . It also would be made available to high earners because the bill would raise the income threshold under which filers may claim the full credit to $ 200,000 for single parents , up from $ 75,000 today ; and to $ 400,000 for married couples , up from $ 110,000 today .
Related : House passes GOP tax bill , goes to vote in Senate later Tuesday
Like the first $ 1,000 of the child tax credit , $ 400 of the additional $ 1,000 also will be refundable , meaning a low- or middle-income family will be able get the money refunded to them if their federal income tax liability nets out at zero .
Even with the additional $ 400 in refundability , however , 10 million children from working low-income families would receive only an additional $ 75 in benefit under the bill , according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates .
6 . Creates temporary credit for non-child dependents : The bill would allow parents to take a $ 500 credit for each non-child dependent whom they 're supporting , such as a child 17 or older , an ailing elderly parent or an adult child with a disability .
7 . Lowers cap on mortgage interest deduction : If you take out a new mortgage on a first or second home you would only be allowed to deduct the interest on debt up to $ 750,000 , down from $ 1 million today . Homeowners who already have a mortgage would be unaffected by the change .
The bill would no longer allow a deduction for the interest on home equity loans . Currently that 's allowed on loans up to $ 100,000 .
8 . Curbs who 's hit by AMT : Earlier bills called for the elimination of the Alternative Minimum Tax . The final version keeps it , but reduces the number of filers who would be hit by it by raising the income exemption levels to $ 70,300 for singles , up from $ 54,300 today ; and to $ 109,400 , up from $ 84,500 , for married couples .
9 . Preserves smaller but popular tax breaks : Earlier versions of the bill had proposed repealing the deductions for medical expenses , student loan interest and classroom supplies bought with a teacher 's own money . They also would have repealed the tax-free status of tuition waivers for graduate students .
The final bill , however , preserves all of these as they are under the current code . And it actually expands the medical expense deduction for 2018 and 2019 .
10 . Exempts almost everybody from the estate tax : Unlike the House GOP bill , the final bill does not call for a repeal of the estate tax .
But it essentially eliminates it for all but the smallest number of people by doubling the amount of money exempt from the estate tax -- currently set at $ 5.49 million for individuals , and $ 10.98 million for married couples . Even at today 's levels , only 0.2 % of all estates ever end up being subject to the estate tax .
11 . Slows inflation adjustments in tax code : The bill would use `` chained CPI '' to measure inflation , which is a slower measure than is used today . The net effect is your deductions , credits and exemptions will be worth less -- since the inflation adjusted dollars defining eligibility and maximum value would grow more slowly . It also would subject more of your income to higher rates in future years than would be the case under the current code .
12 . Eliminates mandate to buy health insurance : There would no longer be a penalty for not buying insurance . While long a goal of Republicans to get rid of it , the measure also would help offset the cost of the tax bill . It is estimated to save money because it would reduce how much the federal government spends on insurance subsidies and Medicaid .
The Congressional Budget Office expects fewer consumers who qualify for subsidies will enroll on the Obamacare exchanges , and fewer people who are eligible for Medicaid will seek coverage and learn they can sign up for the program .
But policy experts also note that the mandate repeal could raise premiums because more healthy people might decide to skip buying insurance .
13 . Lowers tax burden on pass-through businesses : The tax burden on owners , partners and shareholders of S-corporations , LLCs and partnerships -- who pay their share of the business ' taxes through their individual tax returns -- would be lowered by a 20 % deduction , somewhat less than the 23 % called for in the Senate-passed bill .
The 20 % deduction would be prohibited for anyone in a service business -- unless their taxable income is less than $ 315,000 if married ( $ 157,500 if single ) .
14 . Includes rule to prevent abuse of pass-through tax break : If the owner or partner in a pass-through also draws a salary from the business , that money would be subject to ordinary income tax rates .
But to prevent people from recharacterizing their wage income as business profits to get the benefit of the pass-through deduction , the bill would place limits on how much income would qualify for the deduction .
Tax experts nevertheless have warned that this kind of anti-abuse measure still presents taxpayers with a lot of opportunities to game the system , and favors passive owners of a business over active owners who actually run things .
15 . Slashes corporate rate : The bill cuts the corporate rate to 21 % from 35 % , starting next year . That 's somewhat higher than the 20 % called for earlier . The increase was made to free up some revenue to accommodate lawmaker demands on other provisions . The bill would also repeal the alternative minimum tax on corporations .
16 . Change how U.S. multinationals are taxed : Today U.S. companies owe Uncle Sam tax on all their profits , regardless of where the income is earned . They 're allowed to defer paying U.S. tax on their foreign profits until they bring the money home .
Many argue that this `` worldwide '' tax system puts American businesses at a disadvantage . That 's because most foreign competitors come from countries with territorial tax systems , meaning they do n't owe tax to their own governments on income they make offshore .
The final GOP bill proposes switching the U.S. to a territorial system . It also includes a number of anti-abuse provisions to prevent corporations with foreign profits from gaming the system .
In the meantime it would require companies to pay a one-time , low tax rate on their existing overseas profits -- 15.5 % on cash assets and 8 % on non-cash assets ( e.g. , equipment abroad in which profits were invested ) , slightly higher than the rates in the Senate- and House-passed bills .
Correction : An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that personal exemptions lower adjustable gross income . In fact , they lower taxable income . Item No . 3 has been corrected .","It's official.

Both chambers of Congress have now passed the Republican tax overhaul bill on strictly party-line votes. It's the first such overhaul in more than 30 years.

President Trump signed it into law on Friday.

The tax overhaul -- which will affect all corners of the U.S. economy and everyone in it -- will have crossed the finish line in just 7 weeks since first being introduced.

The final bill still leans heavily toward tax cuts for corporations and business owners. But it also expands or restores some tax benefits for individuals relative to the earlier bills passed by the House and Senate.

The individual provisions would expire by the end of 2025, but most of the corporate provisions would be permanent.

All told, the final bill includes trillions in tax cuts, most of which but not all are offset by revenue-raising measures. The bill on net would increase deficits by an estimated $1.46 trillion over a decade, according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. That number would be much higher if, as Republicans assume, a future Congress does not allow the individual tax cuts to expire after 2025.

One important note: The bill would not affect 2017 taxes, for which Americans will start filing their returns in a month or so.

With that, here's a quick rundown of 16 key provisions in the final bill.

FOR INDIVIDUAL FILERS

1. Lowers (many) individual rates: The bill preserves seven tax brackets, but changes the rates that apply to: 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37%.

Today's rates are 10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, 35% and 39.6%.

Here's how much income would apply to the new rates:

-- 10% (income up to $9,525 for individuals; up to $19,050 for married couples filing jointly)

-- 12% (over $9,525 to $38,700; over $19,050 to $77,400 for couples)

-- 22% (over $38,700 to $82,500; over $77,400 to $165,000 for couples)

-- 24% (over $82,500 to $157,500; over $165,000 to $315,000 for couples)

-- 32% (over $157,500 to $200,000; over $315,000 to $400,000 for couples)

-- 35% (over $200,000 to $500,000; over $400,000 to $600,000 for couples)

-- 37% (over $500,000; over $600,000 for couples)

2. Nearly doubles the standard deduction: For single filers, the bill increases it to $12,000 from $6,350 currently; for married couples filing jointly it increases to $24,000 from $12,700.

The net effect: The percentage of filers who choose to itemize would drop sharply, since the only reason to do so is if your deductions exceed your standard deduction.

3. Eliminates personal exemptions: Today you're allowed to claim a $4,050 personal exemption for yourself, your spouse and each of your dependents. Doing so lowers your taxable income and thus your tax burden. The GOP tax plan eliminates that option.

For families with three or more kids, that could mute if not negate any tax relief they might get as a result of other provisions in the bill.

4. Caps state and local tax deduction: The final bill will preserve the state and local tax deduction for anyone who itemizes, but it will cap the amount that may be deducted at $10,000. Today the deduction is unlimited for your state and local property taxes plus income or sales taxes.

The SALT break has been on the book for more than a century. The original House and Senate GOP bills sought to repeal it entirely to help pay for the tax cuts, but that met with stiff resistance from lawmakers in high-tax states.

Residents in the vast majority of counties across the country claim an average SALT deduction below $10,000, according to the Tax Foundation.

Preserving the break -- albeit with a cap -- is likely to provide more help to higher income households in high-tax states.

5. Expands child tax credit: The credit would be doubled to $2,000 for children under 17. It also would be made available to high earners because the bill would raise the income threshold under which filers may claim the full credit to $200,000 for single parents, up from $75,000 today; and to $400,000 for married couples, up from $110,000 today.

Like the first $1,000 of the child tax credit, $400 of the additional $1,000 also will be refundable, meaning a low- or middle-income family will be able get the money refunded to them if their federal income tax liability nets out at zero.

Even with the additional $400 in refundability, however, 10 million children from working low-income families would receive only an additional $75 in benefit under the bill, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates.

6. Creates temporary credit for non-child dependents: The bill would allow parents to take a $500 credit for each non-child dependent whom they're supporting, such as a child 17 or older, an ailing elderly parent or an adult child with a disability.

7. Lowers cap on mortgage interest deduction: If you take out a new mortgage on a first or second home you would only be allowed to deduct the interest on debt up to $750,000, down from $1 million today. Homeowners who already have a mortgage would be unaffected by the change.

The bill would no longer allow a deduction for the interest on home equity loans. Currently that's allowed on loans up to $100,000.

8. Curbs who's hit by AMT: Earlier bills called for the elimination of the Alternative Minimum Tax. The final version keeps it, but reduces the number of filers who would be hit by it by raising the income exemption levels to $70,300 for singles, up from $54,300 today; and to $109,400, up from $84,500, for married couples.

9. Preserves smaller but popular tax breaks: Earlier versions of the bill had proposed repealing the deductions for medical expenses, student loan interest and classroom supplies bought with a teacher's own money. They also would have repealed the tax-free status of tuition waivers for graduate students.

The final bill, however, preserves all of these as they are under the current code. And it actually expands the medical expense deduction for 2018 and 2019.

10. Exempts almost everybody from the estate tax: Unlike the House GOP bill, the final bill does not call for a repeal of the estate tax.

But it essentially eliminates it for all but the smallest number of people by doubling the amount of money exempt from the estate tax -- currently set at $5.49 million for individuals, and $10.98 million for married couples. Even at today's levels, only 0.2% of all estates ever end up being subject to the estate tax.

11. Slows inflation adjustments in tax code: The bill would use ""chained CPI"" to measure inflation, which is a slower measure than is used today. The net effect is your deductions, credits and exemptions will be worth less -- since the inflation adjusted dollars defining eligibility and maximum value would grow more slowly. It also would subject more of your income to higher rates in future years than would be the case under the current code.

12. Eliminates mandate to buy health insurance: There would no longer be a penalty for not buying insurance. While long a goal of Republicans to get rid of it, the measure also would help offset the cost of the tax bill. It is estimated to save money because it would reduce how much the federal government spends on insurance subsidies and Medicaid.

The Congressional Budget Office expects fewer consumers who qualify for subsidies will enroll on the Obamacare exchanges, and fewer people who are eligible for Medicaid will seek coverage and learn they can sign up for the program.

But policy experts also note that the mandate repeal could raise premiums because more healthy people might decide to skip buying insurance.

FOR BUSINESSES AND CORPORATIONS

13. Lowers tax burden on pass-through businesses: The tax burden on owners, partners and shareholders of S-corporations, LLCs and partnerships -- who pay their share of the business' taxes through their individual tax returns -- would be lowered by a 20% deduction, somewhat less than the 23% called for in the Senate-passed bill.

The 20% deduction would be prohibited for anyone in a service business -- unless their taxable income is less than $315,000 if married ($157,500 if single).

14. Includes rule to prevent abuse of pass-through tax break: If the owner or partner in a pass-through also draws a salary from the business, that money would be subject to ordinary income tax rates.

But to prevent people from recharacterizing their wage income as business profits to get the benefit of the pass-through deduction, the bill would place limits on how much income would qualify for the deduction.

Tax experts nevertheless have warned that this kind of anti-abuse measure still presents taxpayers with a lot of opportunities to game the system, and favors passive owners of a business over active owners who actually run things.

15. Slashes corporate rate: The bill cuts the corporate rate to 21% from 35%, starting next year. That's somewhat higher than the 20% called for earlier. The increase was made to free up some revenue to accommodate lawmaker demands on other provisions. The bill would also repeal the alternative minimum tax on corporations.

16. Change how U.S. multinationals are taxed: Today U.S. companies owe Uncle Sam tax on all their profits, regardless of where the income is earned. They're allowed to defer paying U.S. tax on their foreign profits until they bring the money home.

Many argue that this ""worldwide"" tax system puts American businesses at a disadvantage. That's because most foreign competitors come from countries with territorial tax systems, meaning they don't owe tax to their own governments on income they make offshore.

The final GOP bill proposes switching the U.S. to a territorial system. It also includes a number of anti-abuse provisions to prevent corporations with foreign profits from gaming the system.

In the meantime it would require companies to pay a one-time, low tax rate on their existing overseas profits -- 15.5% on cash assets and 8% on non-cash assets (e.g., equipment abroad in which profits were invested), slightly higher than the rates in the Senate- and House-passed bills.

taxes,Fox News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/11/27/norquist-and-influential-anti-tax-pledge-at-center-washington-fiscal-debate/,Norquist and influential anti-tax pledge at center of Washington fiscal debate,2012-11-27,,"For decades , conservative lobbyist Grover Norquist vowed to drive Republicans out of office if they did n't pledge to oppose tax increases . Many lawmakers signed on.But now , several senior Republicans are breaking ranks , willing to consider raising more money through taxes as part of a deal with Democrats to avoid a catastrophic budget meltdown .
Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker says the only pledge he will keep is his oath of office . House Majority Leader Eric Cantor says no one in his home state of Virginia is talking about what leaders in Washington refer to simply as `` The Pledge , '' a Norquist invention that dates to 1986 . Georgia Sen. Saxby Chambliss says he cares more about his country than sticking to Norquist 's pledge .
It 's quite an about-face for senior members of a party that long has stood firmly against almost any notion of tax increases . And while GOP leaders insist they still do n't want to see taxes go up , the reality of a nation in a debt crisis is forcing some to moderate their opposition to any movement on how much Americans pay to fund their government . Republican legislators and Democratic President Barack Obama 's White House are haggling vigorously as they look for ways to reach agreement on detailed tax adjustments and spending cuts before automatic , blunt-force changes occur at the new year .
`` Oh , I signed it , '' Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama said on ███ about Norquist 's pledge , adding he still supports its goals . `` But we 've got to deal with the crisis we face . We 've got to deal with the political reality of the president 's victory . ''
The naysaying about the pledge is raising the question of whether Norquist -- a little-known Republican outside Washington -- is losing his position of power within the GOP . It 's a notion he calls ridiculous .
But he indicated he would turn on lawmakers who defy him , starting with Corker , who published an opinion piece Monday in The Washington Post outlining an alternative to the budget breakdown that includes more revenue .
`` Corker was elected to the Senate because he took the pledge , '' Norquist said on ███ . `` He would not be a senator today if he had n't made that commitment . If he breaks it , he 's going to have to have a conversation with the people of Tennessee about his keeping his word . And the same thing with other people who are elected because they made that written commitment to the people of their state . ''
At the White House , spokesman Jay Carney said Monday that the shifting away from Norquist signaled an opportunity for Republicans to work with President Obama .
`` They represent what we hope is a difference in tone and approach to these problems and a recognition that a balanced approach to deficit reduction is the right approach , '' Carney said .
Norquist , the head of the conservative Americans for Tax Reform , opposes tax increases of any kind , whether eliminating deductions , a position some GOP lawmakers say they 're open to , or raising rates . He has insisted on hardline positions from lawmakers and , for years , has held outsized sway in the party for someone who does not hold public office . His pledge does n't allow any change to the tax code that adds a dollar to revenues .
House Speaker John Boehner has called that notion unrealistic and has dismissed Norquist as `` some random person . ''
Nevertheless , Norquist has maintained a certain level of clout for years .
Heading into the 2012 elections , 279 lawmakers had signed Norquist 's ' pledge , according to Americans for Tax Reform .
But some who have signed the pledge are having second thoughts . And when the new House is seated next year , no more than 212 of them consider themselves bound by the promise .
`` I 'm not obligated on the pledge , '' Corker told CBS News . `` I was just elected . The only thing I 'm honoring is the oath I take when I serve when I 'm sworn in this January . ''
`` When I go to the constituents that have re-elected me , it is not about that pledge , '' Cantor said on MSNBC . `` It really is about trying to solve problems . ''

Sen. John McCain , the Republican presidential nominee in 2008 , said the pledge is losing its clout .
`` Fewer and fewer people are signing this , quote , pledge , '' he told an audience recently .","For decades, conservative lobbyist Grover Norquist vowed to drive Republicans out of office if they didn't pledge to oppose tax increases. Many lawmakers signed on.But now, several senior Republicans are breaking ranks, willing to consider raising more money through taxes as part of a deal with Democrats to avoid a catastrophic budget meltdown.

Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker says the only pledge he will keep is his oath of office. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor says no one in his home state of Virginia is talking about what leaders in Washington refer to simply as ""The Pledge,"" a Norquist invention that dates to 1986. Georgia Sen. Saxby Chambliss says he cares more about his country than sticking to Norquist's pledge.

It's quite an about-face for senior members of a party that long has stood firmly against almost any notion of tax increases. And while GOP leaders insist they still don't want to see taxes go up, the reality of a nation in a debt crisis is forcing some to moderate their opposition to any movement on how much Americans pay to fund their government. Republican legislators and Democratic President Barack Obama's White House are haggling vigorously as they look for ways to reach agreement on detailed tax adjustments and spending cuts before automatic, blunt-force changes occur at the new year.

""Oh, I signed it,"" Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama said on Fox News about Norquist's pledge, adding he still supports its goals. ""But we've got to deal with the crisis we face. We've got to deal with the political reality of the president's victory.""

The naysaying about the pledge is raising the question of whether Norquist -- a little-known Republican outside Washington -- is losing his position of power within the GOP. It's a notion he calls ridiculous.

""Nobody's turning on me,"" Norquist said Monday.

But he indicated he would turn on lawmakers who defy him, starting with Corker, who published an opinion piece Monday in The Washington Post outlining an alternative to the budget breakdown that includes more revenue.

""Corker was elected to the Senate because he took the pledge,"" Norquist said on Fox News. ""He would not be a senator today if he hadn't made that commitment. If he breaks it, he's going to have to have a conversation with the people of Tennessee about his keeping his word. And the same thing with other people who are elected because they made that written commitment to the people of their state.""

At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney said Monday that the shifting away from Norquist signaled an opportunity for Republicans to work with President Obama.

""They represent what we hope is a difference in tone and approach to these problems and a recognition that a balanced approach to deficit reduction is the right approach,"" Carney said.

Norquist, the head of the conservative Americans for Tax Reform, opposes tax increases of any kind, whether eliminating deductions, a position some GOP lawmakers say they're open to, or raising rates. He has insisted on hardline positions from lawmakers and, for years, has held outsized sway in the party for someone who does not hold public office. His pledge doesn't allow any change to the tax code that adds a dollar to revenues.

House Speaker John Boehner has called that notion unrealistic and has dismissed Norquist as ""some random person.""

Nevertheless, Norquist has maintained a certain level of clout for years.

Heading into the 2012 elections, 279 lawmakers had signed Norquist's' pledge, according to Americans for Tax Reform.

But some who have signed the pledge are having second thoughts. And when the new House is seated next year, no more than 212 of them consider themselves bound by the promise.

""I'm not obligated on the pledge,"" Corker told CBS News. ""I was just elected. The only thing I'm honoring is the oath I take when I serve when I'm sworn in this January.""

He's not alone in his stance on the pledge.

""When I go to the constituents that have re-elected me, it is not about that pledge,"" Cantor said on MSNBC. ""It really is about trying to solve problems.""

Chambliss, a veteran senator from Georgia, said he signed the pledge during an earlier campaign when the country's debt was nowhere near its current $16 trillion level.

""Times have changed significantly, and I care more about my country than I do about a 20-year-old pledge,"" Chambliss told his local television station. ""If we do it (Norquist's) way, then we'll continue in debt.""

""I'm frankly not concerned about the Norquist pledge,"" Chambliss added.

The problem , according to a pair of new reports by the Penn Wharton Budget Model , is that Senate Republicans ’ tax bill would increase federal debt by more than advertised , and increased debt accumulation would counteract much — or potentially all — of the positive growth impact of tax cuts .

To comply with the terms of the Byrd Rule that allows Senate Republicans to bypass a Democratic filibuster , the tax plan must meet two conditions .

Penn Wharton thinks gimmicks will reduce revenue

The tax bill has a three-part structure:

There’s a permanent tax cut for business owners.

That’s offset by a permanent tax increase for individuals.

In the short term, the tax increase for individuals is offset by a temporary middle-class tax cut.

The goal, then, is to deliver a big business tax cut without increasing the long-term deficit. Penn Wharton’s model suggests that this won’t work as well as the bill’s authors believe it will, since individuals — especially rich ones who pay a lot of taxes and have good accountants — will engage in deliberate income shifting to take advantage of the temporary tax cuts, as well as “reclassification of income to exploit differences in marginal tax rates, potentially permanent or due to sunsets.”

Dynamic scoring doesn’t save the plan

For years, Republicans have hinted that they would ultimately enact a tax plan by engaging in dynamic scoring — i.e., a form of economic analysis that tries to argue tax cuts will boost economic growth and therefore tax collection and therefore be more affordable than they appear in a static context.

The rich get richer

Penn Wharton finds that in the long term, labor income will rise by somewhere between 1.2 percent and 0.2 percent as a result of the Senate’s tax plans.

• Trump claimed “ anywhere from $ 3 trillion to $ 5 trillion ” of profits are left overseas by U.S. companies to avoid U.S. taxes . But his own press office cites an estimate of $ 2.6 trillion in a fact sheet posted online the day of his speech . The group that published that number told us $ 5 trillion “ seems impossibly high . ”
• The president compared apples to oranges in saying the U.S. just had a 3 % growth rate in gross domestic product — that ’ s for the quarter — while “ on a yearly basis ” under the Obama administration , growth “ never hit 3 % . ” Quarterly GDP growth exceeded 3 % eight times under President Obama .
• Trump said the U.S. was “ dead last ” in terms of business taxes . The U.S. has the highest statutory corporate tax rate among developed countries , but the rate isn ’ t the highest by other measures , such as when tax credits are included .
• Trump said that “ more than 90 % of Americans need professional help to do their own taxes ” because the “ tax code is so complicated. ” Fifty-four percent paid someone else ; another 40 % used tax software .
Trump made his remarks on Aug. 30 in Springfield , Mo. , calling on Congress to “ support pro-American tax reform . ”
Trump exaggerated the amount of money U.S. companies likely have in offshore accounts , nearly doubling a figure the White House includes in a fact sheet , released the same day as the president ’ s remarks .
Trump : `` Because of our high tax rate and horrible , outdated , bureaucratic rules , large companies that do business overseas will often park their profits offshore to avoid paying a high United States tax if the money is brought back home . So they leave the money over there . The amount of money we ’ re talking about is anywhere from $ 3 trillion to $ 5 trillion . Can you believe that ? ''
U.S. companies with business overseas do keep some profits in offshore accounts , where it isn ’ t subject to U.S. corporate taxes until it is repatriated to this country . The profits are declared indefinitely , or permanently , reinvested , which means the companies say they will reinvest the money abroad .
If a U.S. company does bring the money back to the United States , it would be “ subject to the U.S. tax rate of 35 % minus a tax credit equal to whatever taxes the company paid to foreign governments , ” the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy explains in a March report on this issue .
The White House cites figures from that report in its Aug. 30 fact sheet on Trump ’ s tax remarks .
White House fact sheet , Aug. 30 : `` Fortune 500 corporations are holding more than $ 2.6 trillion in profits offshore to avoid $ 767 billion in Federal taxes , according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy . ''
If the White House is citing a figure of $ 2.6 trillion for profits kept overseas , where does Trump get the $ 5 trillion figure ? We asked the White House , but we haven ’ t received a response .
We also asked ITEP , a nonprofit that partners with the left-leaning Citizens for Tax Justice , about the $ 5 trillion figure , which Trump has used before . ITEP Senior Fellow Matthew Gardner told us in an email : “ I have never seen an estimate as high as $ 3 trillion , and the $ 5 trillion number seems impossibly high . ”
ITEP ’ s estimate is for Fortune 500 companies , but the independent research firm Audit Analytics has a database for all companies that file with the Securities and Exchange Commission . Don Whalen , the firm ’ s director of research , told us that as of today , there were $ 2.8 trillion in corporate profits indefinitely reinvested .
Trump ’ s campaign cited a $ 2.1 trillion estimate from 2015 in the footnotes for Trump ’ s economic speech in Detroit in August 2016 . In that speech , Trump said : “ We are also going to bring back trillions of dollars from American businesses that is now parked overseas. ” And his campaign tax plan used a figure of $ 2.5 trillion .
But he has established a pattern of bumping that up to $ 5 trillion . He told the Economic Club of New York in September 2016 : “ Some people say there are $ 2 trillion dollars overseas , I think it ’ s $ 5 trillion. ” And he used the figure in an interview with The Wall Street Journal in late July .
Trump went on to say in his Aug. 30 remarks : “ By making it less punitive for companies to bring back this money , and by making the process far less bureaucratic and difficult , we can return trillions and trillions of dollars to our economy and spur billions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation . ”
It ’ s worth noting that the U.S. has tried to spur repatriation of these earnings before . In 2004 , the American Jobs Creation Act created a one-year reduction that made the tax rate on repatriated profits 5.25 % for companies that paid a 35 % corporate rate , explains a 2011 Congressional Research Service report . About one-third of offshore earnings were brought back to the U.S. , CRS said , but studies on the impact generally found that “ the repatriations did not increase domestic investment or employment . They further conclude that much of the repatriations were returned to shareholders through stock repurchases . ”
The president didn ’ t reveal details on what his tax holiday for offshore profits would be . His campaign tax plan , however , proposed a repatriation tax of 10 % .
Though he gets the numbers right , Trump engaged in some misleading spin when he compared economic growth under his administration with the previous administration .
Trump , Aug. 30 : `` And today , a very appropriate day that this should happen , we just announced that we hit 3 % in GDP . Just came out . And on a yearly basis , as you know , the last administration , during an eight-year period , never hit 3 % . So we ’ re really on our way . ''
It ’ s true that the real GDP growth rate was 3 % for the second quarter of this year , according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis . But Trump doesn ’ t make it clear that he is talking about one quarter , and then he compounds the distortion by comparing one quarter growth to annual growth under the Obama administration .
In fact , the real GDP growth rate exceeded 3 % in eight quarters during the Obama administration , with a high of 5.2 % in the third quarter of 2014 , according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis .
Trump is correct that the annual real GDP growth rate never exceeded 3 % under Obama . The highest it reached was 2.9 % in 2015 , according to the BEA . It remains to be seen if the nation ’ s economy will top 2.9 % annual growth under Trump . Real GDP increased just 1.2 % in the first quarter of this year .
Trump claimed “ when it comes to the business tax , we [ the U.S. ] are dead last. ” And , he said , the U.S. rate is “ 60 % higher ” than “ our economic competitors. ” The U.S. does have the highest statutory corporate tax rate among developed countries . But the U.S. isn ’ t highest when tax credits are factored in , for example .
There are many ways to measure and compare corporate tax burdens , and Trump chose those that paint the U.S. in the worst possible light relative to other countries .
Trump : `` Today , we are still taxing our businesses at 35 % , and it ’ s way more than that . And think of it , in some cases way above 40 % when you include state and local taxes in various states . The United States is now behind France , behind Germany , behind Canada , Ireland , Japan , Mexico , South Korea and many other nations . … `` So when it comes to the business tax , we are dead last . Can you believe this ? So this can not be allowed to continue any longer . America must lead the way , not follow from behind . We have gone from a tax rate that is lower than our economic competitors , to one that is more than 60 % higher . We have totally surrendered our competitive edge to other countries . ''
It ’ s not strictly true that the U.S. has a higher statutory corporate tax rate than every other country in the world . That dubious distinction goes to Comoros , a tiny archipelago off Africa ’ s east coast that has a statutory rate of 50 % , and the United Arab Emirates , which selectively levies at a rate of 55 % , Kyle Pomerleau , director of federal projects at the Tax Foundation , told us .
The federal statutory corporate tax rate in the U.S. is 35 % , as Trump said , and that figure jumps to about 39 % when state taxes are added in . That is highest among the 35 advanced economies tracked by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development . The next highest is France at 34.4 % .
But that ’ s just one way to measure corporate tax burdens . In 2014 , a Congressional Research Service report found that the average effective corporate tax rate in 2008 was 27.1 % , which tracks pretty closely to the GDP weighted average among other OECD countries , 27.7 % .
“ Although the U.S. statutory tax rate is higher , the average effective rate is about the same , and the marginal rate on new investment is only slightly higher , ” the CRS report states . “ The statutory rate differential is relevant for international profit shifting ; effective rates are more relevant for firms ’ investment levels . ”
Pomerleau , of the Tax Foundation , warned however that effective tax rate calculations that simply divide taxes paid by corporate profits skew results for the U.S. That ’ s because the U.S. has a smaller corporate sector than many other developed nations . And that ’ s because the U.S. has a larger proportion of pass-through businesses , such as S corporations and partnerships that are taxed at an individual rather than corporate rate . The marginal individual rate ranges from 10 % to 39.6 % .
A Congressional Budget Office report in March presented three measures of corporate tax . The first , the “ top statutory corporate tax rate , ” lists the U.S. highest among G20 nations at 39.1 % . The second is the “ average corporate tax rate , ” a measure “ of the total amount of corporate taxes that a company pays as a share of its income. ” By that measure , the U.S. rate of 29 % ranks third among G20 countries , behind Argentina at 37.3 % and Indonesia at 36.4 % . Finally , the CBO calculated the “ effective marginal corporate tax rate , ” defined as “ a measure of a corporation ’ s tax burden on returns from a marginal investment. ” By that measure , CBO found , the U.S. rate of 18.6 % was fourth among G20 countries , lower than Argentina ( 22.6 ) , Japan ( 21.7 ) and the United Kingdom ( 18.7 ) .
A 2016 Government Accountability Office report found that from 2006 to 2012 “ at least two-thirds of all active corporations had no federal income tax liability. ” The GAO said : “ Among large corporations ( generally those with at least $ 10 million in assets ) less than half—42.3 percent—paid no federal income tax in 2012 . Of those large corporations whose financial statements reported a profit , 19.5 percent paid no federal income tax that year . ”
As for Trump ’ s claim that “ we have gone from a tax rate that is lower than our economic competitors , to one that is more than 60 % higher , ” that ’ s accurate when comparing the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to the average statutory tax rate among the 35 countries tracked by the OECD . But according to a Congressional Research Service analysis of rates in 2010 , when weighted to reflect the relative size of the countries ’ economies , the difference between the U.S. statutory rate and the OECD average is just 32 % .
Trump discussed the complexity of the U.S. tax code that frustrates today ’ s taxpayers .
Trump : `` In 1935 , the basic 1040 form that most people file had two simple pages of instruction . Today , that basic form has 100 pages of instructions , and it ’ s pretty complex stuff . The tax code is so complicated that more than 90 % of Americans need professional help to do their own taxes . ''
Fifty-four percent of taxpayers — not all Americans — paid someone else to do their taxes for tax year 2014 , according to the Taxpayer Advocate Service , which serves as an advocate for taxpayers at the IRS . And another 40 % of taxpayers used tax software .
That would , of course , include some Americans who choose to use online software for ease and convenience , not necessarily because they think their taxes are too complicated . Some tax filers can use software for free , if they meet income and other requirements set by several companies .
Of the 147.4 million individual returns filed in 2013 , 16 % were through 1040EZ , according to IRS data , which is one page .
He was right when he said that the 1040 instruction form in 1935 was only two pages . Today , the 1040 instruction booklet is 106 pages , although not all of them are instructions . There are dozens of pages of tables and other illustrations . His larger point , however , that filing taxes is much more complicated today is correct .
But Trump ignored one key difference between then and now : Only about 5 % of Americans paid the federal income tax in the 1930s . It wasn ’ t until President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Revenue Act of 1942 that the federal income tax became a tax on the masses , according to the IRS .
IRS , Taxes in U.S. History : `` In 1939 only about five percent of American workers paid income tax . The United States ’ entrance into World War II changed that figure . The demands of war production put almost every American back to work , but the expense of the war still exceeded tax-generated revenue . President Roosevelt ’ s proposed Revenue Act of 1942 introduced the broadest and most progressive tax in American history , the Victory Tax . ''
“ By war ’ s end in 1945 , about 90 percent of American workers submitted income tax forms , and 60 percent paid taxes on their income , ” the IRS says .
In 1935 , the top marginal tax rate was 63 % ; today it is 39.6 % .

In a speech on changing the tax code, President Trump offered some political spin on the facts.

• Trump claimed “anywhere from $3 trillion to $5 trillion” of profits are left overseas by U.S. companies to avoid U.S. taxes. But his own press office cites an estimate of $2.6 trillion in a fact sheet posted online the day of his speech. The group that published that number told us $5 trillion “seems impossibly high.”

• The president compared apples to oranges in saying the U.S. just had a 3% growth rate in gross domestic product — that’s for the quarter — while “on a yearly basis” under the Obama administration, growth “never hit 3%.” Quarterly GDP growth exceeded 3% eight times under President Obama.

• Trump said the U.S. was “dead last” in terms of business taxes. The U.S. has the highest statutory corporate tax rate among developed countries, but the rate isn’t the highest by other measures, such as when tax credits are included.

• Trump said that “more than 90% of Americans need professional help to do their own taxes” because the “tax code is so complicated.” Fifty-four percent paid someone else; another 40% used tax software.

Trump made his remarks on Aug. 30 in Springfield, Mo., calling on Congress to “support pro-American tax reform.”

Offshore Exaggeration

Trump exaggerated the amount of money U.S. companies likely have in offshore accounts, nearly doubling a figure the White House includes in a fact sheet, released the same day as the president’s remarks.

Trump: ""Because of our high tax rate and horrible, outdated, bureaucratic rules, large companies that do business overseas will often park their profits offshore to avoid paying a high United States tax if the money is brought back home. So they leave the money over there. The amount of money we’re talking about is anywhere from $3 trillion to $5 trillion. Can you believe that?""

U.S. companies with business overseas do keep some profits in offshore accounts, where it isn’t subject to U.S. corporate taxes until it is repatriated to this country. The profits are declared indefinitely, or permanently, reinvested, which means the companies say they will reinvest the money abroad.

If a U.S. company does bring the money back to the United States, it would be “subject to the U.S. tax rate of 35% minus a tax credit equal to whatever taxes the company paid to foreign governments,” the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy explains in a March report on this issue.

The White House cites figures from that report in its Aug. 30 fact sheet on Trump’s tax remarks.

White House fact sheet, Aug. 30: ""Fortune 500 corporations are holding more than $2.6 trillion in profits offshore to avoid $767 billion in Federal taxes, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.""

If the White House is citing a figure of $2.6 trillion for profits kept overseas, where does Trump get the $5 trillion figure? We asked the White House, but we haven’t received a response.

We also asked ITEP, a nonprofit that partners with the left-leaning Citizens for Tax Justice, about the $5 trillion figure, which Trump has used before. ITEP Senior Fellow Matthew Gardner told us in an email: “I have never seen an estimate as high as $3 trillion, and the $5 trillion number seems impossibly high.”

ITEP’s estimate is for Fortune 500 companies, but the independent research firm Audit Analytics has a database for all companies that file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Don Whalen, the firm’s director of research, told us that as of today, there were $2.8 trillion in corporate profits indefinitely reinvested.

Trump’s campaign cited a $2.1 trillion estimate from 2015 in the footnotes for Trump’s economic speech in Detroit in August 2016. In that speech, Trump said: “We are also going to bring back trillions of dollars from American businesses that is now parked overseas.” And his campaign tax plan used a figure of $2.5 trillion.

But he has established a pattern of bumping that up to $5 trillion. He told the Economic Club of New York in September 2016: “Some people say there are $2 trillion dollars overseas, I think it’s $5 trillion.” And he used the figure in an interview with The Wall Street Journal in late July.

In 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act created a one-year reduction that made the tax rate on repatriated profits 5.25% for companies that paid a 35% corporate rate, explains a 2011 Congressional Research Service report. About one-third of offshore earnings were brought back to the U.S., CRS said, but studies on the impact generally found that “the repatriations did not increase domestic investment or employment. They further conclude that much of the repatriations were returned to shareholders through stock repurchases.”

The president didn’t reveal details on what his tax holiday for offshore profits would be. His campaign tax plan, however, proposed a repatriation tax of 10%.

GDP Growth

Though he gets the numbers right, Trump engaged in some misleading spin when he compared economic growth under his administration with the previous administration.

Trump, Aug. 30: ""And today, a very appropriate day that this should happen, we just announced that we hit 3% in GDP. Just came out. And on a yearly basis, as you know, the last administration, during an eight-year period, never hit 3%. So we’re really on our way.""

But Trump doesn’t make it clear that he is talking about one quarter, and then he compounds the distortion by comparing one quarter growth to annual growth under the Obama administration.

In fact, the real GDP growth rate exceeded 3% in eight quarters during the Obama administration, with a high of 5.2% in the third quarter of 2014, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

Trump is correct that the annual real GDP growth rate never exceeded 3% under Obama. The highest it reached was 2.9% in 2015, according to the BEA. It remains to be seen if the nation’s economy will top 2.9% annual growth under Trump. Real GDP increased just 1.2% in the first quarter of this year.

Trump claimed “when it comes to the business tax, we [the U.S.] are dead last.” And, he said, the U.S. rate is “60% higher” than “our economic competitors.” The U.S. does have the highest statutory corporate tax rate among developed countries. But the U.S. isn’t highest when tax credits are factored in, for example.

There are many ways to measure and compare corporate tax burdens, and Trump chose those that paint the U.S. in the worst possible light relative to other countries.

Trump: ""Today, we are still taxing our businesses at 35%, and it’s way more than that. And think of it, in some cases way above 40% when you include state and local taxes in various states.

That dubious distinction goes to Comoros, a tiny archipelago off Africa’s east coast that has a statutory rate of 50%, and the United Arab Emirates, which selectively levies at a rate of 55%, Kyle Pomerleau, director of federal projects at the Tax Foundation, told us.

The federal statutory corporate tax rate in the U.S. is 35%, as Trump said, and that figure jumps to about 39% when state taxes are added in. That is highest among the 35 advanced economies tracked by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development. The next highest is France at 34.4%.

But according to a Congressional Research Service analysis of rates in 2010, when weighted to reflect the relative size of the countries’ economies, the difference between the U.S. statutory rate and the OECD average is just 32%.

Misleading on Tax Help

Trump discussed the complexity of the U.S. tax code that frustrates today’s taxpayers.

Trump: ""In 1935, the basic 1040 form that most people file had two simple pages of instruction. Today, that basic form has 100 pages of instructions, and it’s pretty complex stuff. The tax code is so complicated that more than 90% of Americans need professional help to do their own taxes.""

Trump’s statement on professional tax help is misleading.

Fifty-four percent of taxpayers — not all Americans — paid someone else to do their taxes for tax year 2014, according to the Taxpayer Advocate Service, which serves as an advocate for taxpayers at the IRS. And another 40% of taxpayers used tax software.

That would, of course, include some Americans who choose to use online software for ease and convenience, not necessarily because they think their taxes are too complicated. Some tax filers can use software for free, if they meet income and other requirements set by several companies.

Of the 147.4 million individual returns filed in 2013, 16% were through 1040EZ, according to IRS data, which is one page.

He was right when he said that the 1040 instruction form in 1935 was only two pages. Today, the 1040 instruction booklet is 106 pages, although not all of them are instructions. There are dozens of pages of tables and other illustrations. His larger point, however, that filing taxes is much more complicated today is correct.

But Trump ignored one key difference between then and now: Only about 5% of Americans paid the federal income tax in the 1930s. It wasn’t until President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Revenue Act of 1942 that the federal income tax became a tax on the masses, according to the IRS.

IRS, Taxes in U.S. History: ""In 1939 only about five percent of American workers paid income tax. The United States’ entrance into World War II changed that figure. The demands of war production put almost every American back to work, but the expense of the war still exceeded tax-generated revenue. President Roosevelt’s proposed Revenue Act of 1942 introduced the broadest and most progressive tax in American history, the Victory Tax.""

“By war’s end in 1945, about 90 percent of American workers submitted income tax forms, and 60 percent paid taxes on their income,” the IRS says.

In 1935, the top marginal tax rate was 63%; today it is 39.6%.

taxes,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/2/rudy-giuliani-donald-trumps-huge-tax-write-off-sho/,Rudy Giuliani: Donald Trump’s huge tax write-off show ‘absolute genius’,2016-10-02,S.A. Miller,"Donald Trump ’ s team said Sunday that he wasn ’ t just smart but a “ genius ” after a leaked tax return from the 1990s showed a nearly $ 1 billion write-off that likely got him out of paying taxes for years , but it also buttressed accusations by Hillary Clinton that he has avoided taxes .
The Republican presidential nominee ’ s tax bill was already a burning issue in the campaign , fueled by Mr. Trump ’ s refusal to follow tradition and release his federal income tax returns , when a bombshell report revealed the huge deduction in 1996 that could have eliminated years of tax debt .
Mr. Trump also teed up the controversy by quipping in a debate with Mrs. Clinton last week that he would have been “ smart ” if he had avoided paying taxes , as the former first lady charged .
Former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani defended Mr. Trump ’ s tax moves by boasting that the billionaire businessman was an “ absolute genius . ”
“ It shows you what a genius he is , how smart he is , how intelligent he is , how strategic he is . I want that working for me [ as president ] , ” Mr. Giuliani , an adviser to the Trump campaign , said on ABC ’ s “ This Week . ”
He stressed that the 20-year-old deduction was “ perfectly legal , ” noting that years of tax audits never resulted in criminal charges against Mr. Trump .
“ We should get that straight immediately . This is a perfectly legal application of the tax code , ” he said . “ He would have been a fool not to take advantage of it . Not only that , he would have probably breached his fiduciary duty to his investors , to his business . ”
Although the write-off had the potential to keep Mr. Trump from owing any taxes for as much as 18 years , the billionaire ’ s earnings in subsequent years likely exceeded the amount of the deduction and resulted in tax debt , Mr. Giuliani said .
New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie also called Mr. Trump a “ genius ” who followed the law .
“ Politically , he has said he is going to change these laws , and there ’ s no one who is better suited to change these laws than someone like him that has been subjected to audit after audit by the IRS year after year after year , ” Mr. Christie , a former primary rival who now leads the Trump campaign ’ s transition team , said on “ Fox News Sunday . ”
Before the 1996 state tax return surfaced Saturday , Mr. Trump was under fire for saying in a debate with Mrs. Clinton last week that he would be “ smart ” if he got out of paying taxes .
“ Maybe he doesn ’ t want the American people , all of you watching tonight , to know that he ’ s paid nothing in federal taxes , ” Mrs. Clinton said on the debate stage at Hofstra University in New York .
Clinton camping spokesman Brian Fallon said Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Christie were “ doubling down ” on the debate remark .
“ He [ should ] release all his returns so we see his full brilliance , ” tweeted Mr. Fallon .
Sen. Bernard Sanders , a self-identified socialist who was Mrs. Clinton ’ s primary rival but has become a top surrogate , said Americans were “ disgusted ” by Mr. Trump ’ s tax deduction .
He said that billionaires such as Mr. Trump get their lobbyists and “ friends on Capitol Hill ” to put loopholes in the tax code so that they pay no taxes . But middle-class Americans get stuck with the bill for schools , infrastructure and the military , he said .
“ Trump goes around and says , ‘ Hey , I ’ m worth billions . I ’ m a successful businessman . But I don ’ t pay any taxes . But you , you make 15 bucks an hour . You pay the taxes , not me. ’ That is why people are angry and want real change , ” he said on CNN ’ s “ State of the Union . ”
A 1996 state tax return obtained by The New York Times showed Mr. Trump claiming a $ 916 million net operating loss . The massive deduction could have shielded him from any tax liability for up to 18 years , according to tax experts .
The report added pressure on Mr. Trump to release his tax returns .
There is no legal prohibition against releasing tax records amid an audit . There also is no legal requirement that he release the returns , although every presidential candidate for the last 40 years has done so .
Mrs. Clinton has released years of federal income tax returns filed jointly by herself and her husband , former President Bill Clinton , which included some eyebrow-raising deductions .
The Clintons previously claimed charitable donations of clothes , including Mr. Clinton ’ s used underwear , valued at as much as $ 2 each .
In their 2015 return , they deducted charitable donations , including a $ 1 million donation to the Clinton Family Foundation , which distributes money to various charities , including to the Clinton Foundation , which pays for some of the Clintons ’ expenses such as travel .
The Trump campaign responded to the report by accusing the newspaper of attempting to aid Mrs. Clinton . The campaign did not say if Mr. Trump paid federal income taxes in the years since 1996 , although it claimed he paid millions of dollars in various taxes .
“ Mr . Trump ’ s a highly-skilled businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business , his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required , ” the campaign said in a statement . “ That being said , Mr. Trump has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in property taxes , sales and excise taxes , real estate taxes , city taxes , state taxes , employee taxes and federal taxes , along with very substantial charitable contributions . Mr. Trump knows the tax code far better than anyone who has ever run for President and he is the only one that knows how to fix it . ”
The tax bill issue is tricky for both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton .
It is an open question whether getting out of paying taxes is smart . But Mrs. Clinton ’ s allegations also fall flat .
Anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist refused to agree that avoiding paying taxes was smart . But he insisted that the criticism from Mrs. Clinton was both illegitimate and dishonest .
“ The implication is that he ’ s not paying taxes he owes . I assure you the IRS actually cares about that stuff , and if there was even a hint of that , they ’ d have been all over him . That ’ s not the case , ” said Mr. Norquist , founder and president of low-tax advocacy group Americans for Tax Reform .
“ One of the problems with the income tax is it violates people ’ s privacy vis-a-vis the government , and the idea that anybody should open up their personal finances to the government is ridiculous , ” he said . “ The IRS has all of his stuff . If there was anything wrong , the IRS under this administration would have gone after him a long time ago . ”
Accountants who make a living navigating tax laws said the same thing . Bibi Rudstedt , secretary of the Florida chapter of the National Association of Tax Professionals , Mrs. Clinton ’ s accusation lacked merit .
“ Of course everyone pays taxes . I ’ m sure Mr. Trump pays taxes because , with his income , he must have AMT tax on everything , ” she said , referring to the alternative minimum tax that the federal government imposes on the wealthy to prevent them from finding loopholes in tax law .
Mrs. Rudstedt , who has practiced tax accounting with her husband for 25 years in Spring Hill , Florida , bristled at the former secretary of state ’ s allegation that Mr. Trump weaseled out of paying taxes .
“ I think she is stupid because she should know more . A man with that kind of income must pay taxes , ” said Mrs. Rudstedt , a Trump supporter . “ I don ’ t know where she got that from . ”

She wise to do that . If you ’ ve got a problem , keep pointing at other people . ”","Donald Trump’s team said Sunday that he wasn’t just smart but a “genius” after a leaked tax return from the 1990s showed a nearly $1 billion write-off that likely got him out of paying taxes for years, but it also buttressed accusations by Hillary Clinton that he has avoided taxes.

The Republican presidential nominee’s tax bill was already a burning issue in the campaign, fueled by Mr. Trump’s refusal to follow tradition and release his federal income tax returns, when a bombshell report revealed the huge deduction in 1996 that could have eliminated years of tax debt.

Mr. Trump also teed up the controversy by quipping in a debate with Mrs. Clinton last week that he would have been “smart” if he had avoided paying taxes, as the former first lady charged.

Former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani defended Mr. Trump’s tax moves by boasting that the billionaire businessman was an “absolute genius.”

“It shows you what a genius he is, how smart he is, how intelligent he is, how strategic he is. I want that working for me [as president],” Mr. Giuliani, an adviser to the Trump campaign, said on ABC’s “This Week.”

He stressed that the 20-year-old deduction was “perfectly legal,” noting that years of tax audits never resulted in criminal charges against Mr. Trump.

“We should get that straight immediately. This is a perfectly legal application of the tax code,” he said. “He would have been a fool not to take advantage of it. Not only that, he would have probably breached his fiduciary duty to his investors, to his business.”

Although the write-off had the potential to keep Mr. Trump from owing any taxes for as much as 18 years, the billionaire’s earnings in subsequent years likely exceeded the amount of the deduction and resulted in tax debt, Mr. Giuliani said.

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also called Mr. Trump a “genius” who followed the law.

“Politically, he has said he is going to change these laws, and there’s no one who is better suited to change these laws than someone like him that has been subjected to audit after audit by the IRS year after year after year,” Mr. Christie, a former primary rival who now leads the Trump campaign’s transition team, said on “Fox News Sunday.”

Before the 1996 state tax return surfaced Saturday, Mr. Trump was under fire for saying in a debate with Mrs. Clinton last week that he would be “smart” if he got out of paying taxes.

“Maybe he doesn’t want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he’s paid nothing in federal taxes,” Mrs. Clinton said on the debate stage at Hofstra University in New York.

“That makes me smart,” interjected Mr. Trump.

Clinton camping spokesman Brian Fallon said Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Christie were “doubling down” on the debate remark.

“He [should] release all his returns so we see his full brilliance,” tweeted Mr. Fallon.

Sen. Bernard Sanders, a self-identified socialist who was Mrs. Clinton’s primary rival but has become a top surrogate, said Americans were “disgusted” by Mr. Trump’s tax deduction.

He said that billionaires such as Mr. Trump get their lobbyists and “friends on Capitol Hill” to put loopholes in the tax code so that they pay no taxes. But middle-class Americans get stuck with the bill for schools, infrastructure and the military, he said.

“Trump goes around and says, ‘Hey, I’m worth billions. I’m a successful businessman. But I don’t pay any taxes. But you, you make 15 bucks an hour. You pay the taxes, not me.’ That is why people are angry and want real change,” he said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

A 1996 state tax return obtained by The New York Times showed Mr. Trump claiming a $916 million net operating loss. The massive deduction could have shielded him from any tax liability for up to 18 years, according to tax experts.

The report added pressure on Mr. Trump to release his tax returns.

There is no legal prohibition against releasing tax records amid an audit. There also is no legal requirement that he release the returns, although every presidential candidate for the last 40 years has done so.

Mrs. Clinton has released years of federal income tax returns filed jointly by herself and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, which included some eyebrow-raising deductions.

The Clintons previously claimed charitable donations of clothes, including Mr. Clinton’s used underwear, valued at as much as $2 each.

In their 2015 return, they deducted charitable donations, including a $1 million donation to the Clinton Family Foundation, which distributes money to various charities, including to the Clinton Foundation, which pays for some of the Clintons’ expenses such as travel.

The Trump campaign responded to the report by accusing the newspaper of attempting to aid Mrs. Clinton. The campaign did not say if Mr. Trump paid federal income taxes in the years since 1996, although it claimed he paid millions of dollars in various taxes.

“Mr. Trump’s a highly-skilled businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required,” the campaign said in a statement. “That being said, Mr. Trump has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in property taxes, sales and excise taxes, real estate taxes, city taxes, state taxes, employee taxes and federal taxes, along with very substantial charitable contributions. Mr. Trump knows the tax code far better than anyone who has ever run for President and he is the only one that knows how to fix it.”

The tax bill issue is tricky for both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton.

It is an open question whether getting out of paying taxes is smart. But Mrs. Clinton’s allegations also fall flat.

Anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist refused to agree that avoiding paying taxes was smart. But he insisted that the criticism from Mrs. Clinton was both illegitimate and dishonest.

“The implication is that he’s not paying taxes he owes. I assure you the IRS actually cares about that stuff, and if there was even a hint of that, they’d have been all over him. That’s not the case,” said Mr. Norquist, founder and president of low-tax advocacy group Americans for Tax Reform.

“One of the problems with the income tax is it violates people’s privacy vis-a-vis the government, and the idea that anybody should open up their personal finances to the government is ridiculous,” he said. “The IRS has all of his stuff. If there was anything wrong, the IRS under this administration would have gone after him a long time ago.”

Accountants who make a living navigating tax laws said the same thing. Bibi Rudstedt, secretary of the Florida chapter of the National Association of Tax Professionals, Mrs. Clinton’s accusation lacked merit.

“Of course everyone pays taxes. I’m sure Mr. Trump pays taxes because, with his income, he must have AMT tax on everything,” she said, referring to the alternative minimum tax that the federal government imposes on the wealthy to prevent them from finding loopholes in tax law.

Mrs. Rudstedt, who has practiced tax accounting with her husband for 25 years in Spring Hill, Florida, bristled at the former secretary of state’s allegation that Mr. Trump weaseled out of paying taxes.

“I think she is stupid because she should know more. A man with that kind of income must pay taxes,” said Mrs. Rudstedt, a Trump supporter. “I don’t know where she got that from.”

Refusing to say it was “smart” to avoid paying taxes, Mrs. Rudstedt said that dodging taxes wasn’t the goal in her accounting office.

“Everybody has to pay his own share,” she said. “We don’t want them to overpay. But it is important that you claim the deductions you have. If you don’t have any deductions, that’s too bad. But I mean those are the things we have to help people with.”

Mr. Norquist’s nonprofit organization does not endorse candidates. However, he has endorsed Mr. Trump’s proposals to cut taxes and reduce federal regulations, and he has criticized Mrs. Clinton’s tax plan for increasing a variety of taxes.

Talking about Mr. Trump’s tax returns, he said, was a tactical maneuver to let Mrs. Clinton avoid talking about her plan to increase taxes and to duck other issues, such as her secret email setup as secretary of state, with which she mishandled classified material.

He also defended Mr. Trump against Mrs. Clinton’s claim that his attempt to minimize his tax burden was unpatriotic.

“Hillary Clinton has gone to great length to move her inheritable money so it won’t be hit by the death tax, even as she wants to raise other people’s death taxes,” said Mr. Norquist.

He was referring to Mrs. Clinton’s plan to increase estate tax imposed on inherited assets from 40 percent to 45 percent and add a 65 percent “death tax” on property valued at more than $500 million for a single person or $1 billion for a couple.

Mrs. Clinton and her husband use financial planning strategy, including putting ownership of their New York home in a residence trust that will avoid estate taxes, according to an analysis by Bloomberg.

“His position that you try to keep your taxes down is her position,” said Mr. Norquist. “It’s kind of goofy. She’s flailing because she doesn’t want to talk about other things. She wise to do that. If you’ve got a problem, keep pointing at other people.”

Have even liberals had enough of the nanny state?

It didn’t take long for Chicagoans to send the message to their legislators. Though the tax went into effect only on August 2, the general outrage over the one-cent-per-once surcharge on soda and sugary drinks was sufficient to force the Cook County Board of Commissioners to rescind it. Coming on the heels of the landslide defeat of a soda tax twice as large in Santa Fe, N.M., in a special referendum held in May, the Chicago vote may be a turning point in the effort by left-wing activists to force Americans to give up their guilty pleasures.

Americans may have to wait until President Donald Trump leaves the White House to see his tax returns , and he is unlikely to release them as part of a negotiated deal to move his package of tax reform legislation through Congress , Trump said in an interview published Thursday morning .
Asked during an interview with The Economist , conducted last week , whether he would release his tax returns if they became a sticking point for Senate Democrats , whose support his tax reform legislation may need in order to pass , Trump said “ I doubt it . ”
“ Nobody cares about my tax return except for the reporters , ” he said . “ Oh , at some point I 'll release them . Maybe I 'll release them after I 'm finished because I 'm very proud of them actually . I did a good job . ”
At that point , according to the interview transcript , White House director of strategic communications Hope Hicks interjected to suggest that Trump would release his returns , as he and other White House officials have long promised , “ once the audit is over. ” Trump then repeated that “ I might release them after I 'm out of office . ”
During last year ’ s presidential campaign , Trump broke with decades of tradition by refusing to release his tax returns , claiming that his personal lawyers and accountants had advised him not to do so while he was under audit . The IRS has said that there is no regulation against an individual making public their own tax returns while under audit , something former President Richard Nixon did in 1973 .
Democrats have suggested that Trump might be hiding something in his tax returns and that he ought to release them before pursuing any tax reform so that Americans can be assured that his proposals are not constructed specifically to benefit his own tax liabilities .
“ By the way , so as you know I 'm under routine audit , so they 're not going to be done , ” Trump said later in the interview . “ But you know , at a certain point , that 's something I will consider . But I would never consider it as part of a deal . ”","“Nobody cares about my tax return except for the reporters,” President Donald Trump says. | AP Photo Trump: I may release my taxes when I'm out of office

At that point, according to the interview transcript, White House director of strategic communications Hope Hicks interjected to suggest that Trump would release his returns, as he and other White House officials have long promised, “once the audit is over.” Trump then repeated that “I might release them after I'm out of office.”

During last year’s presidential campaign, Trump broke with decades of tradition by refusing to release his tax returns, claiming that his personal lawyers and accountants had advised him not to do so while he was under audit. The IRS has said that there is no regulation against an individual making public their own tax returns while under audit, something former President Richard Nixon did in 1973.

Democrats have suggested that Trump might be hiding something in his tax returns and that he ought to release them before pursuing any tax reform so that Americans can be assured that his proposals are not constructed specifically to benefit his own tax liabilities.

“By the way, so as you know I'm under routine audit, so they're not going to be done,” Trump said later in the interview. “But you know, at a certain point, that's something I will consider. But I would never consider it as part of a deal.”

Is it fair, or a tax increase?",2013-05-07,Ron Scherer,"The day is inching closer when consumers will have to pay state and local sales taxes on goods they purchase on the Internet .
The US Senate late Monday approved legislation to require any e-commerce business with more than $ 1 million in annual sales to collect a sales tax if the goods are delivered to a state that would normally charge such a tax . The Marketplace Fairness Act ( MFA ) , which cleared the Senate by a vote of 69 to 27 , now goes to the House .
Getting the legislation through the House , however , will be more difficult because a key Republican lawmaker , Rep. Bob Goodlatte ( R ) of Virginia , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , has his doubts about the Senate version . Despite bipartisan support , the legislation will still have to pass through his committee – if or when he decides to allow a vote on it .
Conservative groups argue that it is unconstitutional to force e-retailers to tack on a sales tax when they have no physical presence in a state . They also say it will diminish tax competition among the states and will be difficult for online retailers to enforce , given that there are some 9,600 jurisdictions that collect a sales tax .
“ It will present a great deal of compliance burdens that the existence of software can not just magically erase , ” argues Pete Sepp , executive vice president of the Washington-based National Taxpayers Union , which advocates lower taxes and limited government .
But conventional retailers , such as department stores and discounters such as Wal-Mart , as well as state governments looking for additional tax revenues , are urging the House to pass the legislation . They say it will “ level the playing field ” between themselves and Internet-only companies that have not charged sales tax in the past .
“ This legislation is all about fairness , ” says Michael Kercheval , president and chief executive officer of the International Council of Shopping Centers . “ When lawmakers debate this bill , they usually start by saying , ‘ I understand this is not fair and something needs to be done about it . ’ ”
He says software now makes it possible for retailers to calculate sales taxes – which vary from state to state and city to city – just as easily as they calculate shipping charges . The law mandates that each state make sales tax software available free of charge to e-commerce businesses .
Most states would be happy to see the law enacted because they see a large pot of money that has not been collected in the past . A 2009 University of Tennessee study , based upon economic forecasting , projected unpaid sales taxes from Internet sales would amount to $ 23 billion in 2012 .
“ Closing the loophole will actually bring back jobs to bricks-and-mortar businesses , and the sales tax collected will bring new revenues into communities , ” says Mr. Kercheval in an interview .
The dispute over collecting sales tax dates back to a 1992 US Supreme Court decision , Quill Corp. v. North Dakota , that barred states from requiring a retailer to collect sales taxes on its behalf unless the retailer had an actual physical presence such as a warehouse or sales office in the taxing state . However , the court left open the possibility that Congress could change the law .
Immediately after the MFA cleared the Senate , Representative Goodlatte said he was disappointed that the latest version did not follow “ regular order ” in the Senate , but instead bypassed the Senate committee with the subject-matter expertise .
“ Consideration in the House will be more thoughtful , ” he said in a statement .
Goodlatte has already indicated that he has deep reservations about the MFA . For one , the legislation does not make tax collection simpler , he said . “ There is still not uniformity on definitions and tax rates , so businesses would still be forced to wade through potentially hundreds of tax rates and a host of different tax codes and definitions , ” he said .
Goodlatte is also worried that aggressive state tax bureaus could try to pry money out of e-retailers in other states that the bureaus did not think complied with the legislation .
“ The Committee will also look at alternatives that could enable states to collect sales tax revenues without opening the door to aggressive state action against out-of-state companies , ” he said .
Goodlatte ’ s reservations prompt some independent analysts to wonder if the legislation has a future .
“ I think Goodlatte will proceed cautiously , ” says Pete Davis of Davis Capital Investment Ideas , which advises Wall Street clients . “ It looks like a tax increase to a lot of Republicans . ”
Immediately after the Senate passed the legislation , the conservative R Street Institute issued a statement lamenting the Senate 's vote . The organization suggested that the House consider “ origin sourcing , ” in which businesses collect sales taxes using the rate for their own physical location , not that of their customers . For example , a New York consumer purchasing an item from an e-commerce business in Maryland would pay the Maryland sales tax rate , not the New York rate .
“ An origin sourcing approach could address the concerns of Marketplace Fairness Act proponents while preserving proper limits on taxation , due process rights , and privacy protections for consumers , '' said R Street senior fellow Andrew Moylan .

Obama opened a White House news conference today reiterating his call for immediate action by Congress to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for the first $ 200,000 of annual income for individuals and $ 250,000 for married couples . Rates on earnings above those levels should be allowed to rise when they expire at the end of the year , he said .
“ We should at least do what we agree on , ” Obama said . “ I won ’ t pretend that figuring out everything else will be easy . ”
If Congress doesn ’ t act by the end of 2012 , $ 607 billion in automatic spending cuts and tax increases are scheduled to take effect starting in January . Taxes on ordinary income , capital gains , dividends and estates will increase , pushing the top tax rate to 39.6 percent from 35 percent .
Following his news conference , Obama met with a dozen corporate executives , including Honeywell International Inc. Chief Executive Officer David Cote , American Express Co. CEO Kenneth Chenault , Ford Motor Co. CEO Alan Mulally and General Electric Co. CEO Jeffrey Immelt .
Cote said most of the executives “ came away encouraged ” that the president understands that a deal must be struck or the recovery will be at risk . A revamp of the tax code and entitlement programs should be part of a wider deal , he said .
Corporate leaders accept that some higher taxes will be part of any plan to bring down the debt , he said .
“ All of us understand that there ’ s going to have to be more collected in taxes , ” Cote said in a ███ Television interview after the one-hour and 20-minute meeting with Obama .
Once work is done on the deficit , Cote said he hopes there is “ political will left ” to support spending on infrastructure and on math and science education .
The session was part of an administration campaign to build support for the president ’ s position in advance of a White House meeting on Nov. 16 with congressional leaders . He met yesterday with labor representatives and plans events outside of Washington to rally public support after the Thanksgiving holiday .
While Obama has signaled willingness to compromise , neither he nor top congressional Republicans have publicly offered any concessions . House Speaker John Boehner , in letter today to fellow House Republicans , said they were “ the last line of defense in Washington ” against a “ government that spends too much , taxes too much , and borrows too much . ”
Averting the fiscal cliff should happen “ in a manner that steers clear of increased tax rates and encourages economic growth instead , ” Boehner said .
The president said today it would be “ very difficult ” to cut the deficit by curbing breaks in the tax code without raising rates . Some Republicans have called instead for closing tax loopholes and lowering rates .
“ There are loopholes that can be closed and we should look at how we can make the process of deductions , the filing process easier , simpler , ” Obama said . “ But when it comes to the top two percent , what I ’ m not going to do is to extend further a tax cut for folks who don ’ t need it , which would cost close to a trillion . ”
Obama ’ s position , from his fiscal 2013 budget , calls for $ 1.6 trillion over 10 years in additional revenue from high-income taxpayers . That ’ s twice the amount that Boehner , an Ohio Republican , discussed in talks last year .
Obama said it isn ’ t realistic to expect Republicans will adopt his budget proposal . “ I recognize that we ’ re going to have to compromise , ” he said .
Failure to reach an agreement to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff risks pushing the U.S. back into a recession .
The Standard & Poor ’ s 500 Index has fallen about 5 percent since Election Day set up a budget showdown between Obama and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives . The benchmark gauge is trading below its average price from the past 200 days , and has pared its 2012 gain to about 8 percent . It tumbled 1.4 percent to 1,356.29 at 4 p.m. in New York , reversing an early gain of 0.4 percent and closing at the lowest level since July .
Treasuries 10-year note yields traded close to two-month low , dropping to 1.59 percent at 4:59 p.m. in New York , according to ███ Bond Trader prices .
The blueprint for a deal to avoid the fiscal cliff early next year may be found in the failed debt negotiations between Obama and Boehner in mid-2011 .
The contours of that plan included revenue increases , spending cuts and changes to lower the long-term costs of entitlement programs . Before the talks collapsed , Boehner was willing to accept $ 800 billion in revenue increases and Obama was ready to settle for $ 1.2 trillion .
Part of their negotiations on a $ 4 trillion deficit-cutting plan included a gradual increase in the Medicare eligibility age to 67 and an alternative yardstick for calculating inflation that would reduce annual Social Security cost-of-living adjustments and raise taxes by slowing the annual adjustments in tax bracket thresholds .
In recent days , Boehner has emphasized opposition to higher tax rates , rather than talking about higher taxes or higher revenue . He has endorsed the idea of increasing government revenue through an overhaul of the tax code without saying explicitly whether he would support a tax increase or the elimination of tax breaks without a corresponding rate cut .
Obama also took questions on topics including the scandal that forced CIA Director David Petraeus to resign last week , the deadly attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi , Libya , and the chances for legislation to revamp the nation ’ s immigration laws .
He said there was no indication so far that classified information was disclosed as a result of the extramarital affair that led Petraeus to resign .
Petraeus ’ s resignation , and a related investigation of Marine General John Allen , the president ’ s now on-hold nominee to be NATO ’ s top commander , complicates Obama ’ s task as he prepares to overhaul his Cabinet for his second term .
Congressional panels have scheduled hearings into the Benghazi attack and Petraeus had been called to testify . Obama said a full investigation is under way and the results will be presented to the public .
The president also said he expects that “ very soon after ” his inauguration that there will be legislation introduced that will include a pathway to legal status for some of those now in the U.S. illegally .","SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email

Cote said most of the executives “came away encouraged” that the president understands that a deal must be struck or the recovery will be at risk. A revamp of the tax code and entitlement programs should be part of a wider deal, he said.

Corporate leaders accept that some higher taxes will be part of any plan to bring down the debt, he said.

Once work is done on the deficit, Cote said he hopes there is “political will left” to support spending on infrastructure and on math and science education.

The session was part of an administration campaign to build support for the president’s position in advance of a White House meeting on Nov. 16 with congressional leaders. He met yesterday with labor representatives and plans events outside of Washington to rally public support after the Thanksgiving holiday.

Boehner Letter

While Obama has signaled willingness to compromise, neither he nor top congressional Republicans have publicly offered any concessions. House Speaker John Boehner, in letter today to fellow House Republicans, said they were “the last line of defense in Washington” against a “government that spends too much, taxes too much, and borrows too much.”

Averting the fiscal cliff should happen “in a manner that steers clear of increased tax rates and encourages economic growth instead,” Boehner said.

The president said today it would be “very difficult” to cut the deficit by curbing breaks in the tax code without raising rates. Some Republicans have called instead for closing tax loopholes and lowering rates.

“There are loopholes that can be closed and we should look at how we can make the process of deductions, the filing process easier, simpler,” Obama said. “But when it comes to the top two percent, what I’m not going to do is to extend further a tax cut for folks who don’t need it, which would cost close to a trillion.”

Obama’s Position

Obama’s position, from his fiscal 2013 budget, calls for $1.6 trillion over 10 years in additional revenue from high-income taxpayers. That’s twice the amount that Boehner, an Ohio Republican, discussed in talks last year.

Obama said it isn’t realistic to expect Republicans will adopt his budget proposal. “I recognize that we’re going to have to compromise,” he said.

Failure to reach an agreement to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff risks pushing the U.S. back into a recession.

The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has fallen about 5 percent since Election Day set up a budget showdown between Obama and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. The benchmark gauge is trading below its average price from the past 200 days, and has pared its 2012 gain to about 8 percent. It tumbled 1.4 percent to 1,356.29 at 4 p.m. in New York, reversing an early gain of 0.4 percent and closing at the lowest level since July.

Treasuries 10-year note yields traded close to two-month low, dropping to 1.59 percent at 4:59 p.m. in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.

2011 Failure

The blueprint for a deal to avoid the fiscal cliff early next year may be found in the failed debt negotiations between Obama and Boehner in mid-2011.

The contours of that plan included revenue increases, spending cuts and changes to lower the long-term costs of entitlement programs. Before the talks collapsed, Boehner was willing to accept $800 billion in revenue increases and Obama was ready to settle for $1.2 trillion.

Part of their negotiations on a $4 trillion deficit-cutting plan included a gradual increase in the Medicare eligibility age to 67 and an alternative yardstick for calculating inflation that would reduce annual Social Security cost-of-living adjustments and raise taxes by slowing the annual adjustments in tax bracket thresholds.

Tax Debate

In recent days, Boehner has emphasized opposition to higher tax rates, rather than talking about higher taxes or higher revenue. He has endorsed the idea of increasing government revenue through an overhaul of the tax code without saying explicitly whether he would support a tax increase or the elimination of tax breaks without a corresponding rate cut.

Obama also took questions on topics including the scandal that forced CIA Director David Petraeus to resign last week, the deadly attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and the chances for legislation to revamp the nation’s immigration laws.

He said there was no indication so far that classified information was disclosed as a result of the extramarital affair that led Petraeus to resign.

Petraeus’s resignation, and a related investigation of Marine General John Allen, the president’s now on-hold nominee to be NATO’s top commander, complicates Obama’s task as he prepares to overhaul his Cabinet for his second term.

Congressional panels have scheduled hearings into the Benghazi attack and Petraeus had been called to testify. Obama said a full investigation is under way and the results will be presented to the public.

The president also said he expects that “very soon after” his inauguration that there will be legislation introduced that will include a pathway to legal status for some of those now in the U.S. illegally.",www.bloomberg.com,center,V6fHDNV4tWhDTfxF

House Democrats issued subpoenas on Friday to force Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig to release six years of President Trump's tax returns.

Democrats say the returns include information about Trump and his business dealings that is critical to their constitutional oversight duties. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., issued the subpoena after Mnuchin failed to comply with a request from House Democrats that he voluntarily turn over the returns.

""While I do not take this step lightly, I believe this action gives us the best opportunity to succeed and obtain the requested material. I sincerely hope that the Treasury Department will furnish the requested material in the next week so the committee can quickly begin its work,"" Neal said in a written statement.

Administration officials, including Mnuchin, insist the request is unreasonable and illegal. Democrats argue that Neal, as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, is legally allowed to request the tax returns of any private citizen — citing a section of the tax code that states the Treasury secretary ""shall furnish"" that information.

But Mnuchin rejected the request this week, telling Neal that he was relying on Department of Justice advice that the request ""lacks a legitimate legislative purpose.""

Trump has refused to comply with requests for his taxes since before he was elected, arguing that he is under audit and he does not believe he is legally required to disclose the information. ""There is no law,"" Trump said in April. ""While I'm under audit I won't do it.""

The IRS's Rettig told the House Appropriations Committee in April that there is no rule barring the release of tax returns if an individual is under audit.

Democrats say they are prepared for a lengthy court battle over the returns.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., says Democrats have the legal authority to request Trump's taxes and must do so as part of their ongoing investigations.

This week, Pelosi cited a recent New York Times report that Trump reported more than $1 billion in losses between 1984 and 1993 as further reason to request his returns.

Patriotic Millionaires , made up of high net-worth donors , was formed in 2010 to demand an end to President George W. Bush ’ s tax cuts benefiting top earners . Now , the group is pushing for new taxes on the wealthy and is backing ideas like Warren ’ s proposed annual 2 percent tax on fortunes of more than $ 50 million and an even larger levy on assets above $ 1 billion .
“ While some may say the proposal is too extreme , as a millionaire I say it ’ s far overdue , ” Patriotic Millionaires Chairman Morris Pearl , a former executive at BlackRock Inc. , said of Warren ’ s proposal in a blog post .
Democratic donors are also more focused on the bigger progressive picture , said Ken Christensen , a Democratic fundraiser in Washington . That ’ s true for billionaire Tom Steyer , who was the second-largest Democratic donor in the 2018 cycle , and is pouring millions of dollars into a push to trigger impeachment hearings against Trump and to get the president ’ s tax returns released .
Another factor helping Democrats this cycle : A few wealthy donors don ’ t mean as much to a campaign as they once did . In fact , having a wide base of donors is critical to make the first televised primary debate in June . To qualify , candidates must have at least 65,000 unique donors with a minimum of 200 donors per state in at least 20 states .
“ Fundraising is going to be a barometer of how viable of a candidate you are , ” Christensen said .
Sanders , who propelled his 2016 presidential effort with small-dollar donations , seems set to do the same this cycle . He announced his 2020 candidacy on Tuesday and raised $ 6 million from more than 225,000 donors , with the average donation at $ 27 , his campaign tweeted .
A key plank in Sander ’ s platform so far : a much expanded estate tax .
Since yesterday morning , the response to our campaign has been incredible .
We are just getting started . Let 's stand together to transform this country . https : //t.co/6gBtXRTWhf — Bernie Sanders ( @ BernieSanders ) February 20 , 2019
“ Democrats for a long time have been very reluctant to talk about taxes , ” said Brad Bannon , a Democratic strategist . President Ronald Reagan “ created a political climate where any talk of a tax increase was deadly for Democrats . ”
That thinking has changed . Late in 2017 , Republicans passed legislation that lowered taxes for four in five Americans . But the overhaul was often portrayed as aiding corporate and wealthy taxpayers more than the middle class and ended up a political liability in the midterms . Democrats are now capitalizing on the unpopularity of the law for the 2020 campaigns .
Warren has encapsulated what is likely to become the new Democratic playbook : Rather than propose several social programs and gloss over how to pay for it , she is proposing a revenue-generating tax , building up public support for it and then announcing how she ’ ll spend it .
She introduced a $ 2.75 trillion wealth tax last month . On Monday , she announced a plan to use some of the funds for universal childcare . Based on her campaign ’ s numbers , she would still have about a little more than $ 2 trillion to allocate to other programs .

Democrats have vowed to repeal much of the GOP tax overhaul -- which slashed the corporate tax rate to 21 percent and reduced taxes for many individuals . Yet reverting to the 2017 status quo isn ’ t enough for this cycle .
“ Any presidential candidate needs to have a bold tax plan , ” Gabriel Zucman , an economist at the University of California-Berkeley who has advised Warren . After the tax overhaul “ candidates need to explain how they would change the system . ”
Sanders would expand the estate tax to apply to estates starting at $ 3.5 million , down from $ 11 million , as well as increase the rate of the tax . Freshman Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York , who is too young to seek the presidency herself , has floated the idea of raising the top tax bracket to 70 percent for incomes exceeding $ 10 million . The ideas have moved the needle on what Democratic primary voters expect to hear .
How Trump ’ s Could-be Rivals Aim to Hit the Super-Rich : QuickTake
Polling data show that many voters have long supported increasing taxes on the rich . About 60 percent of voters have consistently said over the past decade that upper-income individuals pay too little , according to data from Gallup .
“ The politicians are just now catching up with the voters , ” said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake .
Income inequality has also increased and the data showing just how much separates the rich from other Americans has also improved . The top 0.1 percent held about 7 percent of the wealth in the U.S. in the late 1970s , but by 2012 , that group had 22 percent , according to research published by Zucman and his colleague Emmanuel Saez .
The trick for Democratic contenders is to be able to translate the popularity of taxing the rich into support for their means of doing it . Sixty-one percent of voters back Warren ’ s wealth tax and 50 percent approve of Sander ’ s estate tax expansion , according to a February poll by Morning Consult and Politico .
The taxes on the wealthy make for convenient campaign talking points , but rarely translate into actual legislation once in power , according to Mattie Duppler , a senior fellow at the right-leaning National Taxpayers Union . That ’ s another factor that may make wealthy donors comfortable contributing to candidates like Sanders and Warren .
Democrats , in 2013 , ultimately made permanent many of the tax cuts Bush and Congress passed a decade earlier .
“ Democrats talk a lot about raising taxes on the wealthy , ” Duppler said . “ But when it comes down to it , they rarely take the votes to make it the case . ”","LISTEN TO ARTICLE 6:17 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email

“While some may say the proposal is too extreme, as a millionaire I say it’s far overdue,” Patriotic Millionaires Chairman Morris Pearl, a former executive at BlackRock Inc., said of Warren’s proposal in a blog post.

Democratic donors are also more focused on the bigger progressive picture, said Ken Christensen, a Democratic fundraiser in Washington. That’s true for billionaire Tom Steyer, who was the second-largest Democratic donor in the 2018 cycle, and is pouring millions of dollars into a push to trigger impeachment hearings against Trump and to get the president’s tax returns released.

Another factor helping Democrats this cycle: A few wealthy donors don’t mean as much to a campaign as they once did. In fact, having a wide base of donors is critical to make the first televised primary debate in June. To qualify, candidates must have at least 65,000 unique donors with a minimum of 200 donors per state in at least 20 states.

“Fundraising is going to be a barometer of how viable of a candidate you are,” Christensen said.

Sanders, who propelled his 2016 presidential effort with small-dollar donations, seems set to do the same this cycle. He announced his 2020 candidacy on Tuesday and raised $6 million from more than 225,000 donors, with the average donation at $27, his campaign tweeted.

A key plank in Sander’s platform so far: a much expanded estate tax.

Since yesterday morning, the response to our campaign has been incredible.

“Democrats for a long time have been very reluctant to talk about taxes,” said Brad Bannon, a Democratic strategist. President Ronald Reagan “created a political climate where any talk of a tax increase was deadly for Democrats.”

That thinking has changed. Late in 2017, Republicans passed legislation that lowered taxes for four in five Americans. But the overhaul was often portrayed as aiding corporate and wealthy taxpayers more than the middle class and ended up a political liability in the midterms. Democrats are now capitalizing on the unpopularity of the law for the 2020 campaigns.

Warren has encapsulated what is likely to become the new Democratic playbook: Rather than propose several social programs and gloss over how to pay for it, she is proposing a revenue-generating tax, building up public support for it and then announcing how she’ll spend it.

She introduced a $2.75 trillion wealth tax last month. On Monday, she announced a plan to use some of the funds for universal childcare. Based on her campaign’s numbers, she would still have about a little more than $2 trillion to allocate to other programs.

Democrats have vowed to repeal much of the GOP tax overhaul -- which slashed the corporate tax rate to 21 percent and reduced taxes for many individuals. Yet reverting to the 2017 status quo isn’t enough for this cycle.

“Any presidential candidate needs to have a bold tax plan,” Gabriel Zucman, an economist at the University of California-Berkeley who has advised Warren. After the tax overhaul “candidates need to explain how they would change the system.”

Sanders would expand the estate tax to apply to estates starting at $3.5 million, down from $11 million, as well as increase the rate of the tax. Freshman Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who is too young to seek the presidency herself, has floated the idea of raising the top tax bracket to 70 percent for incomes exceeding $10 million. The ideas have moved the needle on what Democratic primary voters expect to hear.

How Trump’s Could-be Rivals Aim to Hit the Super-Rich: QuickTake

Polling data show that many voters have long supported increasing taxes on the rich. About 60 percent of voters have consistently said over the past decade that upper-income individuals pay too little, according to data from Gallup.

“The politicians are just now catching up with the voters,” said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake.

Income inequality has also increased and the data showing just how much separates the rich from other Americans has also improved. The top 0.1 percent held about 7 percent of the wealth in the U.S. in the late 1970s, but by 2012, that group had 22 percent, according to research published by Zucman and his colleague Emmanuel Saez.

The trick for Democratic contenders is to be able to translate the popularity of taxing the rich into support for their means of doing it. Sixty-one percent of voters back Warren’s wealth tax and 50 percent approve of Sander’s estate tax expansion, according to a February poll by Morning Consult and Politico.

The taxes on the wealthy make for convenient campaign talking points, but rarely translate into actual legislation once in power, according to Mattie Duppler, a senior fellow at the right-leaning National Taxpayers Union. That’s another factor that may make wealthy donors comfortable contributing to candidates like Sanders and Warren.

Democrats, in 2013, ultimately made permanent many of the tax cuts Bush and Congress passed a decade earlier.

“Democrats talk a lot about raising taxes on the wealthy,” Duppler said. “But when it comes down to it, they rarely take the votes to make it the case.”",www.bloomberg.com,center,MHMsBzmChS3gIaXH

When the government “fines” you for not buying health insurance, is it, in fact, a fine, a tax or government extortion? The biggest U.S. banks have been “fined” something in the neighborhood of $125 billion (yes, billion) over the past five years, without anyone in the banks or the banks themselves charged or convicted of criminal wrongdoing. How can that be?

Countless individuals have had their property (automobiles, cash and bank accounts) seized by state, local and federal law enforcement officials, including the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), without being convicted of wrongdoing. How can that be?

The distinction between a tax, a fine and government extortion is not trivial, particularly when fines are running into the tens of billions or even hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue for the government. Article I, Section 7 of the U.S. Constitution states: “All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives.” The Fourth Amendment states: “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated,” and that warrants can only be issued with probable cause. The Fifth Amendment in part states: “No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation.” Unfortunately, these basic and clear provisions of the Constitution are violated on a daily basis by all too many ignorant or corrupt law enforcement officials, and upheld all too often by judges who think their own opinions trump the Constitution.

In the Obamacare case. Chief Justice John Roberts upheld the law by ruling that a “fine” for not buying health insurance, which would not be legal, was actually a “tax,” which was legal — even though the Obama administration and most members of Congress who voted for the bill denied they were voting for a tax. (A very short and amusing interview on this issue, with well-known constitutional scholar and Cato board chairman, Bob Levy, is available on the websites of The Washington Times and of the Center for Freedom and Prosperity Foundation.)

The government, merely by threatening to bring charges against banks and their officers, has been able to extort multibillion-dollar fines, because a charge of criminal wrongdoing against a bank could cause depositors to flee, undermining its viability. The Justice and Treasury departments have also engaged in this type of extortion against foreign banks, including destroying a 350-year old bank in Switzerland that had no offices in the United States and was not in violation of Swiss law. Justice and Treasury are able to get away with this type of extortion because a number of the bank regulations contradict each other. Thus, it is impossible for the banks to be in total compliance with all of the regulations, and they are sitting ducks for extortion by intellectually and politically corrupt government officials.

Asset-forfeiture laws were passed to make it easier to convict drug dealers, tax evaders and “money launderers,” but the idea has been expanded to now include more than 200 crimes. For many years, the IRS has been seizing bank accounts without bothering to get convictions for tax evasion. Some law enforcement officials have used the seized cash and property to fund their own operations, even though those whose property was taken were in many cases not convicted of any wrongdoing. This corruption has led the first two directors of the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Office (John Yoder and Brad Cates) to call for repeal of the asset forfeiture and anti-money laundering laws. The abuses have been so widespread that demands for reform are growing. Even The Washington Post has taken notice, publishing an article two weeks ago by Mr. Yoder and Mr. Cates in which they wrote: “Civil asset forfeiture and money-laundering laws are gross perversions of the status of government amid a free citizenry. The individual is the font of sovereignty in our constitutional republic, and it is unacceptable that a citizen should have to ‘prove’ anything to the government. If the government has probable cause of a violation of law, then let a warrant be issued. And if the government has proof beyond a reasonable doubt of guilt, let that guilt be proclaimed by 12 peers.”

The citizens of Hong Kong have been courageously standing up to the Chinese government for violations of their basic rights. Yet, too many Americans have become timid (unlike the American Founders, who were not wimps) in protecting our own rights against the abuses by the IRS, some law enforcement officials and irresponsible judges. It would be interesting to know where all of those who are now running for the House and Senate stand on asset forfeiture and other forms of government extortion — and what they intend to do about it.

Williamson, Tobias Hoonhout, Victor Davis Hanson","The Republican tax relief should have helped working families more , but the help it does give is a meaningful improvement over the status quo .
Earlier this week , my family received a disturbing piece of junk mail . I ’ m used to getting simulated checks in the mail , advertisements for personal loans or potential home-equity loans with eye-popping numbers on the front . They ’ ll say , “ This is not a check , ” but they ’ re obviously beckoning you — hoping you ’ ll submit a loan application so the number becomes real .
This week , however , the envelope was marked “ Holiday Cash , ” and the amount on the check was lower . It was only $ 500 . Moreover , it said “ this is a real check. ” All I had to do was endorse the back and cash it at a local bank . There was a catch , of course . I ’ d be instantly obligated to repay a short-term , high-interest-rate loan . I ’ d get cash now , and I ’ d pay much more later . But when a family can ’ t afford to pay for Christmas presents — or is short on rent — how many will sign that check and worry about the consequences next year ?
I get quite a few of these mailers . My county ’ s median income is more than $ 10,000 below the national median , and when you drive any distance outside our quaint , picturesque downtown you enter into a world of store-front payday lenders . Lots of people are hurting . Lots of people have to borrow money just to make ends meet .
Let ’ s put the plight of tens of millions of Americans in concrete context . In a recent Federal Reserve Board survey , 47 percent of respondents said they couldn ’ t pay for a $ 400 emergency without borrowing money or selling some of their possessions . Other studies have reached similar results . A majority of Americans — 59 percent — don ’ t have the resources to cover a $ 1,000 emergency . More than half don ’ t have a total of $ 1,000 in their savings and checking accounts combined .
So , given this reality , can an extra $ 800 or $ 1,000 per year make a difference for a working family ? That ’ s roughly the amount of tax relief coming to millions of American households as a result of the GOP tax reform .
Not if you asked a segment of left-wing Twitter yesterday . A festival of mockery broke out over the notion that “ only ” $ 18 per week can make a difference for working families . You can ’ t go to a decent restaurant for that amount . You can ’ t pay for a swimming lesson . Or , the horror , you might be reduced to dining at McDonald ’ s on your tax savings .
But what if you saved that money ? What if you have that extra bit of margin that makes life just a little bit less stressful ? Writing in The Atlantic , a self-described “ middle class ” writer described what it was like to be one of those Americans who doesn ’ t have $ 400 to spare :
I know what it is like to have to juggle creditors to make it through a week . I know what it is like to have to swallow my pride and constantly dun people to pay me so that I can pay others . I know what it is like to have liens slapped on me and to have my bank account levied by creditors . I know what it is like to be down to my last $ 5 — literally — while I wait for a paycheck to arrive , and I know what it is like to subsist for days on a diet of eggs . I know what it is like to dread going to the mailbox , because there will always be new bills to pay but seldom a check with which to pay them . I know what it is like to have to tell my daughter that I didn ’ t know if I would be able to pay for her wedding ; it all depended on whether something good happened . And I know what it is like to have to borrow money from my adult daughters because my wife and I ran out of heating oil .
Would keeping an additional $ 1,000 per year change his life ? Doubtful . But mocking the impact of that extra money for the majority of Americans who live on financial margins that most writers and pundits can ’ t comprehend is absurd .
Consider a counterfactual . Would the same people scoffing at the impact of $ 18 per week make the same arguments if , say , GOP reforms were shrinking public benefits by the amount ? Would they say , “ Who cares ? It ’ s only one less trip to McDonald ’ s ” ? Of course not . They ’ d properly see the negative impact of even small-dollar financial changes .
I believe two things at once . The Republican tax relief should have helped working families more , but the help it does give is a meaningful improvement over the status quo . Moreover , the corporate tax-rate reduction is intended to spur additional economic growth that will lead to hiring and wage increases that supplement and improve on the direct economic effects of family tax relief .
No one should exaggerate the effects of tax reform — in either direction .
In fact ( though the announcements were a tad gimmicky ) , since yesterday ’ s bill signing we ’ ve seen a wave of corporate announcements of bonuses , pay raises , and capital investments that bring direct benefits to hundreds of thousands of families — and that ’ s just the fruit of one day of policy change .
No one should exaggerate the effects of tax reform — in either direction . It ’ s not the bill that cures what ails the struggling American family . Economic stagnation and economic insecurity are grounded in political , cultural , and economic factors that are beyond the reach of any single tax bill or any single legislative reform . But legislation can help or hurt , and a bill that allows American families who typically don ’ t have $ 1,000 to spare to keep $ 1,000 more of their own money every year is a bill that ’ s likely to help , and if a struggling family uses that money wisely , it can even help a lot .","(Photo: Martin Taschner/Dreamstime)

They’ll say, “This is not a check,” but they’re obviously beckoning you — hoping you’ll submit a loan application so the number becomes real.

This week, however, the envelope was marked “Holiday Cash,” and the amount on the check was lower. It was only $500. Moreover, it said “this is a real check.” All I had to do was endorse the back and cash it at a local bank. There was a catch, of course. I’d be instantly obligated to repay a short-term, high-interest-rate loan. I’d get cash now, and I’d pay much more later. But when a family can’t afford to pay for Christmas presents — or is short on rent — how many will sign that check and worry about the consequences next year?

I get quite a few of these mailers. My county’s median income is more than $10,000 below the national median, and when you drive any distance outside our quaint, picturesque downtown you enter into a world of store-front payday lenders. Lots of people are hurting. Lots of people have to borrow money just to make ends meet.

Let’s put the plight of tens of millions of Americans in concrete context. In a recent Federal Reserve Board survey, 47 percent of respondents said they couldn’t pay for a $400 emergency without borrowing money or selling some of their possessions. Other studies have reached similar results. A majority of Americans — 59 percent — don’t have the resources to cover a $1,000 emergency. More than half don’t have a total of $1,000 in their savings and checking accounts combined.

So, given this reality, can an extra $800 or $1,000 per year make a difference for a working family? That’s roughly the amount of tax relief coming to millions of American households as a result of the GOP tax reform.

Not if you asked a segment of left-wing Twitter yesterday. A festival of mockery broke out over the notion that “only” $18 per week can make a difference for working families. You can’t go to a decent restaurant for that amount. You can’t pay for a swimming lesson. Or, the horror, you might be reduced to dining at McDonald’s on your tax savings.

But what if you saved that money? What if you have that extra bit of margin that makes life just a little bit less stressful? Writing in The Atlantic, a self-described “middle class” writer described what it was like to be one of those Americans who doesn’t have $400 to spare:

I know what it is like to have to juggle creditors to make it through a week. I know what it is like to have to swallow my pride and constantly dun people to pay me so that I can pay others. I know what it is like to have liens slapped on me and to have my bank account levied by creditors. I know what it is like to be down to my last $5 — literally — while I wait for a paycheck to arrive, and I know what it is like to subsist for days on a diet of eggs. I know what it is like to dread going to the mailbox, because there will always be new bills to pay but seldom a check with which to pay them. I know what it is like to have to tell my daughter that I didn’t know if I would be able to pay for her wedding; it all depended on whether something good happened. And I know what it is like to have to borrow money from my adult daughters because my wife and I ran out of heating oil.

Would keeping an additional $1,000 per year change his life? Doubtful. But mocking the impact of that extra money for the majority of Americans who live on financial margins that most writers and pundits can’t comprehend is absurd.

Consider a counterfactual. Would the same people scoffing at the impact of $18 per week make the same arguments if, say, GOP reforms were shrinking public benefits by the amount? Would they say, “Who cares? It’s only one less trip to McDonald’s”? Of course not. They’d properly see the negative impact of even small-dollar financial changes.

I believe two things at once. The Republican tax relief should have helped working families more, but the help it does give is a meaningful improvement over the status quo. Moreover, the corporate tax-rate reduction is intended to spur additional economic growth that will lead to hiring and wage increases that supplement and improve on the direct economic effects of family tax relief.

No one should exaggerate the effects of tax reform — in either direction.

In fact (though the announcements were a tad gimmicky), since yesterday’s bill signing we’ve seen a wave of corporate announcements of bonuses, pay raises, and capital investments that bring direct benefits to hundreds of thousands of families — and that’s just the fruit of one day of policy change.

No one should exaggerate the effects of tax reform — in either direction. It’s not the bill that cures what ails the struggling American family. Economic stagnation and economic insecurity are grounded in political, cultural, and economic factors that are beyond the reach of any single tax bill or any single legislative reform. But legislation can help or hurt, and a bill that allows American families who typically don’t have $1,000 to spare to keep $1,000 more of their own money every year is a bill that’s likely to help, and if a struggling family uses that money wisely, it can even help a lot.

BUDGET RESOLUTION

The budget resolution released by the Senate Budget Committee, which would pave the way for Republicans to avoid potential Democratic procedural moves to block it, builds in $1.5 trillion in reduced revenue from tax cuts over the next decade.

The White House and Republicans in Congress aim to have the tax proposal passed by the end of the year. Republicans control the White House, the Senate and both chambers of Congress.

The resolution is vital to plans by the Republicans to move tax legislation through the Senate, which they control by a slim 52-48 majority, using a parliamentary process that lets them pass legislation without a customary 60-vote threshold that would necessitate some Democratic support.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Republican who will soon step down as chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives tax committee late on Monday released a sweeping, nearly 300-page tax bill that he said would affect Americans’ retirement savings, numerous business tax breaks and redesign the Internal Revenue Service.

Representative Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee only until early January, shepherded through the House and onto President Donald Trump’s desk in 2017 a large tax bill that slashed the U.S. corporate tax rate.

Of his latest legislation, Brady said in a statement, “The policy proposals in this package have support of Republicans and Democrats in both chambers. I look forward to swift action in the House to send these measures to the Senate.”

American voters ended Republican control of the House in the Nov. 6 elections and handed majority power to the Democrats. Brady is expected to be replaced as committee chairman in January by Democratic Representative Richard Neal.

In the interim, Congress is holding a “lame duck” session in which Republicans such as Brady will still be in charge of the House agenda. No summary of Brady’s bill was immediately available, said a spokesman for the lawmaker.

The legislation’s outlook was not immediately clear, with Congress likely to be busy in the “lame duck” session with a must-pass spending measure and Trump’s renewed demands for money to build a proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

taxes,Fox News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/14/tax-day-protests-anti-trump-marches-planned-nationwide-to-demand-tax-returns.html,Tax Day protests: Anti-Trump marches planned nationwide to demand tax returns,2017-04-14,,"Democratic lawmakers and liberal activists plan to ring in Tax Day with nationwide protests this weekend meant to pressure President Trump to release his tax returns -- with organizers hoping for the biggest anti-Trump showing since January 's Women 's March .
On Saturday , thousands are expected to attend 'Tax Marches ' in approximately 150 cities , including several affiliated events overseas .
“ Whether people support him or not , [ releasing his tax returns ] is something that people think he should do . I think there is a chance something like this could move him , ” said Lisa Gilbert , vice president of legislative affairs at Public Citizen , one of the groups organizing the marches .
The president 's supporters , however , see the marches -- and the persistent tax return focus -- as a waste of time .
In Colorado Springs , Trump backers plan to hold a counter-protest on Saturday . For them , what is in Trump 's tax returns pales in comparison to what could be in his tax plan .
`` Their whole message is they want to see the president 's tax returns . I care far more about his policy than his tax returns , '' Trevor Dierdorff , El Paso County Republican Party chairman , told the Colorado Springs Gazette .
Rep. Jim Renacci , R-Ohio , said during a recent House Ways and Means Committee hearing that the pressure on Trump to release his returns is a `` political mission , '' arguing the kind of bombshells Democrats are seeking would n't even be in such documents .
The protests , if nothing else , could make for a rowdy scene in cities across the country , reminiscent of the Women 's March on inauguration weekend .
As many as 25,000 are expected to attend the rally in Washington , D.C. Sen. Ron Wyden , D-Ore. , and Reps. Maxine Waters , D-Calif. , and Jamie Raskin , D-Md. , will be among the speakers .
Two of the largest events are expected in Seattle , site of the World Trade Organization protests of the 1990s . In addition to the expected 25,000 marching in “ Tax March Seattle , ” as many as 7,000 Black Lives Matter activists plan to come out for their own rally focusing on Trump 's tax returns .
There also is a protest planned in front of Trump Plaza in West Palm Beach , Fla . The protest will move to Bingham Island , directly adjacent to the Mar-a-Lago resort where Trump is staying for the weekend . According to their Facebook page , about 1,000 are expected to attend .
While organic in nature , the marches are being organized under the umbrella of several liberal activists . The partnering labor unions and activist groups range from the well-known -- MoveOn.org and Common Cause -- to more obscure players like the Endangered Species Coalition .
Gilbert contends the events could build support for an agenda beyond Trump ’ s taxes , such as tax fairness and economic justice .

On Saturday, thousands are expected to attend 'Tax Marches' in approximately 150 cities, including several affiliated events overseas.

“Whether people support him or not, [releasing his tax returns] is something that people think he should do. I think there is a chance something like this could move him,” said Lisa Gilbert, vice president of legislative affairs at Public Citizen, one of the groups organizing the marches.

The president's supporters, however, see the marches -- and the persistent tax return focus -- as a waste of time.

In Colorado Springs, Trump backers plan to hold a counter-protest on Saturday. For them, what is in Trump's tax returns pales in comparison to what could be in his tax plan.

""Their whole message is they want to see the president's tax returns. I care far more about his policy than his tax returns,"" Trevor Dierdorff, El Paso County Republican Party chairman, told the Colorado Springs Gazette.

Rep. Jim Renacci, R-Ohio, said during a recent House Ways and Means Committee hearing that the pressure on Trump to release his returns is a ""political mission,"" arguing the kind of bombshells Democrats are seeking wouldn't even be in such documents.

The protests, if nothing else, could make for a rowdy scene in cities across the country, reminiscent of the Women's March on inauguration weekend.

As many as 25,000 are expected to attend the rally in Washington, D.C. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Reps. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., and Jamie Raskin, D-Md., will be among the speakers.

Two of the largest events are expected in Seattle, site of the World Trade Organization protests of the 1990s. In addition to the expected 25,000 marching in “Tax March Seattle,” as many as 7,000 Black Lives Matter activists plan to come out for their own rally focusing on Trump's tax returns.

There also is a protest planned in front of Trump Plaza in West Palm Beach, Fla. The protest will move to Bingham Island, directly adjacent to the Mar-a-Lago resort where Trump is staying for the weekend. According to their Facebook page, about 1,000 are expected to attend.

While organic in nature, the marches are being organized under the umbrella of several liberal activists. The partnering labor unions and activist groups range from the well-known -- MoveOn.org and Common Cause -- to more obscure players like the Endangered Species Coalition.

Gilbert contends the events could build support for an agenda beyond Trump’s taxes, such as tax fairness and economic justice.

She said Saturday’s events are focused on transparency and accountability, issues that unite Americans -- and noted that bills have been introduced in numerous states that would require presidential candidates to disclose their taxes.

Don’t blow it, GOP.

Much as he did in his command performance before the U.N. when he took back control of U.S. foreign policy, President Trump has seized and energized the tax-cut issue. Almost daily, he is pounding away on the themes of faster economic growth and more take-home pay, arguing that his plan will make America’s economy great again.

This is Trumpian leadership at its best.

“Under my administration,” Trump just told the National Association of Manufacturers, “the era of economic surrender is over.”

The Trump plan would slash large and small business tax rates, double the standard deduction for middle-income folks, make the whole tax code simpler by eliminating unnecessary deductions, repeal the death tax, and end the alternative minimum tax.

As usual, Democrats say the president’s plan is a hand-out to the rich. But in a recent speech in Indianapolis, Trump asked: Why can’t this be a bipartisan tax cut bill? He even quoted Democrat John F. Kennedy, who said, “The right kind of tax cut at the right time . . . is the most effective measure that this government could take to spur our economy forward.”

But today’s Democrats have written JFK’s tax story out of the history books (never mind Reagan’s).

Key tax-writing committees are now polishing the Trump plan, fine-tuning it to pass the Senate with 51 votes. But there are a couple of key points that need clarifying.

The argument that the U.S. is doomed to 2 percent or less growth — “secular stagnation” — no matter what we do in terms of tax policy, is nonsense. Across-the-board tax cuts produced 5 percent annual growth during the JFK period. And after tax cuts were fully implemented in 1983, real growth averaged 4.6 percent for the remainder of Reagan’s presidency.

But the incentive effects don’t stop there. The key to wage growth is productivity. Think of it as efficiency. And large and small businesses need new capital investment to modernize equipment and better train an efficient workforce.

The supply-side incentive effect also includes the repatriation of trillions of U.S. company dollars lodged overseas to avoid taxes, as well as 100 percent expensing write-offs for new investment of any kind.

Taken together, this plan contains a mountain of incentives.

On the individual side, the sleeper tax detail is the doubling of the standard deduction. As my CNBC colleague Jake Novak points out, this is a huge positive for young millennials (who don’t own much) and folks with no mortgages or homes. It puts more cash in worker’s pockets, simplifies the code, and means that near 80 percent of taxpayers won’t have any deductions.

For all the talk of how the rich stand to gain , the plan doubles the standard income tax deduction helping a majority of Trump 's working class base .
But there 's a problem with this plan , a problem that has long plagued reformers in the two controlling parties : The failure to put a stop to the spending that necessitates higher taxes .
After so many promises broken , the yearly warnings of impending fiscal crisis fail to alarm anyone . I sometimes worry I am self-plagiarizing , having written the same recaps so many times year after year . Without major reforms , debt will continue to rise to unsustainable levels , yet Congress perpetually fails to take serious action .
Now , when a Republican occupies the White House , the deficit suddenly matters again , and most mainstream discussion has centered on how much Trump 's tax plan will add to it . Vice President Pence insisted Sunday to MSNBC 's Chuck Todd that while the plan might increase the deficit , `` in the short term '' economic growth would more than make up the gap . Democrats and some nonpartisan watchdogs are , to say the least skeptical of Pence 's forecast .
It remains unclear exactly what `` pay-fors '' will be included in the final package , but at least President Trump has officially abandoned the Border Adjustment Tax , which is good news – if you like affordable consumer goods and free markets .
But the deficit implications could end up imperiling the political chances of passing any major reform . Republicans who have spent the last eight years decrying debt and spending under Obama find themselves in an unenviable position – at least as long as they ignore spending .
Trump 's tax reform plan has been estimated to add around $ 6 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years . When the Tax Foundation analyzed Trump 's campaign tax plan last year , they found roughly a third of that deficit impact would be made up by economic growth .
While some others have been less optimistic , we 'll work from these assumptions , which leave about $ 400 billion per year remaining .
It would , of course , be nearly impossible , politically and procedurally , to seek spending cuts to make up for every dollar in tax changes . But to abandon the idea outright would be unacceptable . Obvious cuts abound .
The Government Accountability Office 's 2017 study of duplication and fragmentation identifies at least $ 20 billion in potential savings per year . Past estimates by former Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn have been as high as $ 95 billion per year . For our purposes , let 's assume a conservative total of $ 25 billion year or $ 250 billion over a decade in savings .
Back in January , news broke that the Pentagon buried an internal report that found administrative waste alone could be reduced by $ 125 billion over a 5-year period , without requiring layoffs or personnel reductions . There 's another $ 25 billion per year from the country 's biggest discretionary department .
No politically dicey changes would be required just yet on the infamous mandatory side . There are the well documented improper government payments , estimated at $ 144 billion for fiscal year 2016 . Most of this is overpayments by Medicare and Medicaid , along with other programs like federal education grants and the EITC .
This brings the total identified savings to just under $ 200 billion , assuming no increases since 2016 .
To be clear , no spending cut is easy – every dollar in waste has its own interest group loudly insisting no other dollar could be more important to the wellbeing of the country .
But none of these suggestions involve sequestering workers or even meaningfully changing the size or role of government and its departments . When just a few items can make up as much as half of the shortfall from a massive tax cut , it should be a sign to policymakers that focusing on spending cuts is possible .
And if Republicans believe cutting duplicative programs , self-identified waste , and improper payments is just not politically possible and not worth fighting for , perhaps they should ask themselves just what the hell they 're doing in Washington in the first place .","Congress produced yet another can-kicking, stop-gap spending bill, and now major tax reform is on its way.

Without major reforms, debt will continue to rise to unsustainable levels, yet Congress perpetually fails to take serious action.

Now, when a Republican occupies the White House, the deficit suddenly matters again, and most mainstream discussion has centered on how much Trump's tax plan will add to it. Vice President Pence insisted Sunday to MSNBC's Chuck Todd that while the plan might increase the deficit, ""in the short term"" economic growth would more than make up the gap. Democrats and some nonpartisan watchdogs are, to say the least skeptical of Pence's forecast.

It remains unclear exactly what ""pay-fors"" will be included in the final package, but at least President Trump has officially abandoned the Border Adjustment Tax, which is good news – if you like affordable consumer goods and free markets.

But the deficit implications could end up imperiling the political chances of passing any major reform. Republicans who have spent the last eight years decrying debt and spending under Obama find themselves in an unenviable position – at least as long as they ignore spending.

Things don't have to be this way.

Trump's tax reform plan has been estimated to add around $6 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years. When the Tax Foundation analyzed Trump's campaign tax plan last year, they found roughly a third of that deficit impact would be made up by economic growth.

While some others have been less optimistic, we'll work from these assumptions, which leave about $400 billion per year remaining.

It would, of course, be nearly impossible, politically and procedurally, to seek spending cuts to make up for every dollar in tax changes. But to abandon the idea outright would be unacceptable. Obvious cuts abound.

The Government Accountability Office's 2017 study of duplication and fragmentation identifies at least $20 billion in potential savings per year. Past estimates by former Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn have been as high as $95 billion per year. For our purposes, let's assume a conservative total of $25 billion year or $250 billion over a decade in savings.

Back in January, news broke that the Pentagon buried an internal report that found administrative waste alone could be reduced by $125 billion over a 5-year period, without requiring layoffs or personnel reductions. There's another $25 billion per year from the country's biggest discretionary department.

No politically dicey changes would be required just yet on the infamous mandatory side. There are the well documented improper government payments, estimated at $144 billion for fiscal year 2016. Most of this is overpayments by Medicare and Medicaid, along with other programs like federal education grants and the EITC.

This brings the total identified savings to just under $200 billion, assuming no increases since 2016.

To be clear, no spending cut is easy – every dollar in waste has its own interest group loudly insisting no other dollar could be more important to the wellbeing of the country.

But none of these suggestions involve sequestering workers or even meaningfully changing the size or role of government and its departments. When just a few items can make up as much as half of the shortfall from a massive tax cut, it should be a sign to policymakers that focusing on spending cuts is possible.

And if Republicans believe cutting duplicative programs, self-identified waste, and improper payments is just not politically possible and not worth fighting for, perhaps they should ask themselves just what the hell they're doing in Washington in the first place.",www.reason.com,right,3QLCUto3nUT0ByMO

President Donald Trump said Friday that the process to reform America’s tax code will kick into high gear next week.

“We’ll be having a big announcement on Wednesday having to do with tax reform. The process has begun long ago, but it really formally begins on Wednesday,” Trump said Friday afternoon after signing executive orders at the Treasury Department.

“So,” he added, turning to and pointing at Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, “go do it.”

“I will, Mr. President,” Mnuchin replied.

Earlier on Friday, Trump told The Associated Press that his administration will release its tax reform plan next week — ahead of the White House's 100-day mark. The president provided no details to AP but said individuals and businesses will receive “massive tax cuts,” which he predicted would be “bigger I believe than any tax cut ever.” He added that the plan will be unveiled “Wednesday or shortly thereafter.”

It’s the most specific date yet Trump has put on the release of a tax plan. His timing, however, has been off before. In February, he said a plan was coming in “two or three weeks.” But no plan ever materialized.

Despite the confidence of the president and his Treasury secretary on Friday, a White House official expressed skepticism at Trump’s self-set deadline to unveil a tax reform plan.

The tax reform package could come next week — “or maybe not,” the official said. “No guarantees.”

House Republicans, who have a plan of their own, have been eagerly awaiting details on Trump’s proposal. Several controversial trial balloons have been floated, though it’s not clear whether they actually came from the White House. Among them: a carbon tax, a value-added tax and a deep cut to the payroll tax. All were considered non-starters on Capitol Hill, and the White House knocked down the first two ideas.

While the funding deadline was created when Congress passed a continuing resolution to keep the government open last year through April 28, the new emphasis on passing Obamacare repeal seems to be a late push by the White House to have a significant legislative achievement it can tout on Day 100.

Trump has long promised massive tax cuts but said this week it would be easier to accomplish if Republicans passed legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare first. Health care reform, Trump said Tuesday in Wisconsin, “just makes the tax reform easier, and it makes it better.”

In his public remarks at the Snap-on facility in Kenosha, Wisconsin, Trump signaled that a tax reform plan would be coming “very soon.”

Phillip,"Conservative groups have rejected an Internal Revenue Service apology for unjustifiably scrutinizing tax-exempt conservative groups during the 2012 election cycle . The IRS apology has seemingly validated conservatives ' fears of politically motivated regulation .
Lois Lerner , the director the IRS unit that oversees tax-exempt organizations , said that organizations had been given additional scrutiny if their applications included the words `` Tea Party '' or `` patriot . '' The practice originated with `` low-level '' employees in Cincinnati , according to an Associated Press report .
In a press conference on Friday , Lerner called the actions of these employees `` absolutely inappropriate . ''
`` They did n't do it because of any political bias , '' Lerner said , adding that singling out groups with specific names was an ill-thought-out organizational `` shortcut . ''
`` It was an error in judgment and it was n't appropriate but that 's what they did , '' she said .
`` We 've now corrected these issues , and we do n't expect that any of these will be repeated going forward . ''
Despite the apology , conservative groups are now seizing on the news , which they say proves their long-standing complaints of mistreatment by the IRS .
`` President Obama must also apologize for his administration ignoring repeated complaints by these broad grassroots organizations of harassment by the IRS in 2012 , and make concrete and transparent steps today to ensure this never happens again , '' said Jenny Beth Martin , national coordinator for Tea Party Patriots .
Tea Party Express founder Sal Russo told ███ that his group , formed as a PAC , never heard from the IRS but did hear from smaller Tea Party groups that complained of government scrutiny .
`` On our bus tours the local Tea Party groups were all screaming about it . It was so pronounced around the country that it was obvious that the tea party groups were being targeted . Not unlike any bureaucracy , the first reaction is to deny everything even when they do n't know the facts , '' Russo told ███ , saying he is `` glad they finally acknowledged what was obvious to everyone else . ''
`` We appreciate that the IRS acknowledged and apologized , but the real question is , how do we make sure that this never happens again ? All Americans , regardless of their philosophical beliefs , should be treated equally under the laws of the land , '' said Jackie Bodnar , spokeswoman for the tax-exempt tea-party group FreedomWorks .
Republican members of Congress were also quick to register their displeasure , and House leaders have promised to investigate .
House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa , who has dogged the Obama administration from his position on the House 's top investigative panel , promised to delve into the matter .
`` The fact that Americans were targeted by the IRS because of their political beliefs is unconscionable . The committee will aggressively follow up on the IG report and hold responsible officials accountable for this political retaliation , '' Issa said in a statement .
House Speaker John Boehner and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor echoed his promise .
`` The IRS can not target or intimidate any individual or organization based on their political beliefs . The House will investigate this matter , '' Cantor said .
`` Today , we are left with serious questions : Who is ultimately responsible for this travesty ? What actions will the Obama administration take to hold them accountable ? And have other federal agencies used government powers to attack Americans for partisan reasons ? '' Boehner said in a statement . `` House Republicans have made oversight of federal agencies a top priority on behalf of the American people , and I applaud the work that members such as Charles Boustany , Darrell Issa and Jim Jordan have done to bring this issue to light . ''
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , publicly asked President Obama to review his entire administration for politicization .
`` Today , I call on the White House to conduct a transparent , government-wide review aimed at assuring the American people that these thuggish practices are not underway at the IRS or elsewhere in the administration against anyone , regardless of their political views , '' McConnell said in a statement .
Michael Macleod-Ball , chief of staff at the ACLU 's Washington Legislative Office , called the IRS story `` constitutionally troubling '' and suggested that `` there must be clear checks in place to prevent this from ever happening again .

At his daily press briefing on Friday , White House Press Secretary Jay Carney called the IRS 's actions `` inappropriate . ''
`` We 've certainly seen those reports . My understanding is this matter is under investigation by the IG [ inspector general ] at the IRS , '' Carney said , when asked if the administration would oblige McConnell 's request for an administration-wide review .
`` The IRS , as you know , is an independent enforcement agency , with only two political appointees . The fact of the matter is what we know about this is of concern , and we certainly find the actions taken as reported to be inappropriate , and we would fully expect the investigation to be thorough and for corrections to be made , '' Carney said .
Carney pointed out that the IRS commissioner in 2012 , Douglas Shulman , was appointed by President George W. Bush . Asked when the White House became aware of the extra reviews , Carney referred questions to the IRS .

So far , none of those applications have been rejected , although some have been withdrawn .
The news came after an election cycle punctuated by claims by liberal and watchdog groups that conservative tax-exempt organizations were unduly influencing political elections , and in some cases , violating their tax-exempt status .
Groups with a 501 ( c ) 4 tax status are prohibited from using more than half of their resources for electioneering activities .
`` The revelations revealed today that the IRS was targeting conservative groups during the 2012 elections is shocking , '' said David Bossie , president of Citizen 's United , the 501 ( c ) 4 organization that touched off much of the recent controversy over these groups ' role in political elections .
`` The politicization of the IRS can not be tolerated by the American people . To single out groups because they offer a point of view that is different from the Obama administration harkens back to the dark days of the Nixon administration . ''
Some liberal and watchdog groups believed that the IRS was n't doing enough to review groups that they believed might be flouting their 501 ( c ) 4 tax-exempt status in the 2012 election .
`` That 's the most interesting thing about this : They were actually doing it , '' said Kenneth Gross , a campaign finance law expert and former counsel of the Federal Election Commission . `` Now that they have done it , to some degree , it looks like they stepped on a pile off dog doo . ''

taxes,Fox News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/01/03/tax-hikes-start-this-week-for-all/,"As tax hikes kick in for all, top earners pay growing share",2013-01-03,"William La Jeunesse, In March","Taxes are going up this week on almost everyone , but one group of top earners will feel the pinch far more than others . The .7 percent .
It 's an exclusive club created by President Obama 's new tax plan . Already the most progressively taxed nation in the world , the U.S. becomes more top heavy with the new tax code , analysts say .
With income tax hikes concentrated on only those individuals earning more than $ 400,000 and couples making more than $ 450,000 , about 40 percent of all federal income taxes will now be paid by just .7 percent of all federal income tax returns , according to preliminary numbers from Tax Foundation Chief Economist William McBride .
`` We are currently the reigning champion of progressivity . This deal will make our tax code even more progressive , '' said McBride . `` We can not sustain a situation where the top 1 percent pays 40 percent of the tax burden , while the bottom half roughly on average pays no income taxes . ''
Previous data showed about 37 percent of the federal income tax burden fell on the top 1 percent , while 41 percent had a zero or negative tax liability . The share of nonpayers , which has doubled since 1990 , is expected to stay consistent for at least five years under the deal .
The tax plan approved this week raises the top marginal rate to 39.5 percent on those making over $ 400,000/ $ 450,000 and their capital gains rate rises from 15 to 20 percent . Two other provisions also limit the value of their deductions . Taken together , McBride estimates the top .7 percent -- roughly 1.1 million of 143 million tax returns -- will pay about 40 percent of all federal income taxes .
`` It creates huge divisions in society and breeds contempt . It 's class warfare . It is also unsustainable because it disconnects voters . The bottom half of the population pays no income tax .

The .7 percent.

It's an exclusive club created by President Obama's new tax plan. Already the most progressively taxed nation in the world, the U.S. becomes more top heavy with the new tax code, analysts say.

With income tax hikes concentrated on only those individuals earning more than $400,000 and couples making more than $450,000, about 40 percent of all federal income taxes will now be paid by just .7 percent of all federal income tax returns, according to preliminary numbers from Tax Foundation Chief Economist William McBride.

""We are currently the reigning champion of progressivity. This deal will make our tax code even more progressive,"" said McBride. ""We cannot sustain a situation where the top 1 percent pays 40 percent of the tax burden, while the bottom half roughly on average pays no income taxes.""

Previous data showed about 37 percent of the federal income tax burden fell on the top 1 percent, while 41 percent had a zero or negative tax liability. The share of nonpayers, which has doubled since 1990, is expected to stay consistent for at least five years under the deal.

The tax plan approved this week raises the top marginal rate to 39.5 percent on those making over $400,000/$450,000 and their capital gains rate rises from 15 to 20 percent. Two other provisions also limit the value of their deductions. Taken together, McBride estimates the top .7 percent -- roughly 1.1 million of 143 million tax returns -- will pay about 40 percent of all federal income taxes.

""It creates huge divisions in society and breeds contempt. It's class warfare. It is also unsustainable because it disconnects voters. The bottom half of the population pays no income tax. That's hugely disruptive. Those folks now have an incentive to lobby for more federal spending and it disconnects them from the cost of the federal government.""

While most taxpayers were shielded from increases in their income taxes, payroll taxes went up for everyone. The IRS issued new withholding guidelines for employers earlier this week. Some workers will see the higher deductions on Friday -- others next week.

Here are some examples.

-- for a single person earning $38,000 a year, the IRS told employers to withhold $5,437 a year. That's up $570, or $11 a week.

-- for someone earning $90,000, they will pay $19,885 -- or $2,443 more than last year.

-- for someone earning $185,000, the government will withhold $49,459 -- an increase of $5,977.

-- for someone earning over $400,000, payroll taxes will increase by $270 per week or $14,212 a year.

Still, payroll taxes (that's the FICA deduction on your paycheck) pay for Social Security and Medicare. That is money taxpayers eventually get back, and then some.

This is the latest story in our series on money in politics.

If you have a mortgage on your home, you can deduct the interest from your taxes. It's a popular, well-entrenched policy. But according to one policy adviser to a U.S. senator, ""the mortgage-interest deduction, from a purely policy perspective ... makes no sense.""

It's a view that's supported by a mountain of academic research: The mortgage-interest tax deduction benefits the rich more than the poor, has little effect on home ownership and isn't even really a bargain for homeowners because it raises home prices.

So do policy advisers tell members of Congress to fight the mortgage-interest tax deduction?

""If you're relatively green in Washington, I suppose that happens. And I suppose you're laughed at,"" said the adviser, who preferred not to give his name for fear of losing his job. ""The mortgage-interest deduction is a sacred cow.""

Everyone in Washington, D.C., knows that there are many powerful forces making sure that no one ever suggests getting rid of the mortgage-interest deduction. Jimmy Williams, a former lobbyist for the National Association of Realtors, was one of those forces.

""If I were at the Realtors right now, I'd declare war"" on anyone who tried to get rid of the deduction, Williams says.

He would run ads, encourage Realtors across the country to make phone calls and give money to the most powerful legislators in Washington. ""And then you sit back and just say, 'You really want to go down this path? That's just not a really smart way to run for re-election.' ""

Jamie Gregory, who currently lobbies for the Realtors, says if you got rid of the deduction tomorrow, home prices would fall all over the country, which would destabilize the economy. And besides, he says, the biggest lobby in favor of the deduction is homeowners.

""For middle-class Americans, either doing away or limiting the mortgage-interest deduction is going to be a tax increase,"" he says.

People who have bought a house assuming they'll get a break on their taxes each year want that tax break. They might not be able to afford the house they're in without it.

Documents obtained by ███ show stark differences in how Donald Trump ’ s businesses reported some expenses , profits and occupancy figures for two Manhattan buildings , giving a lender different figures than they provided to New York City tax authorities . The discrepancies made the buildings appear more profitable to the lender — and less profitable to the officials who set the buildings ’ property tax .
For instance , Trump told the lender that he took in twice as much rent from one building as he reported to tax authorities during the same year , 2017 . He also gave conflicting occupancy figures for one of his signature skyscrapers , located at 40 Wall Street .
Lenders like to see a rising occupancy level as a sign of what they call “ leasing momentum. ” Sure enough , the company told a lender that 40 Wall Street had been 58.9 % leased on Dec. 31 , 2012 , and then rose to 95 % a few years later . The company told tax officials the building was 81 % rented as of Jan. 5 , 2013 .
Get More Trump , Inc. Stay up to date with email updates from WNYC and ███ about their ongoing investigations .
A dozen real estate professionals told ███ they saw no clear explanation for multiple inconsistencies in the documents . The discrepancies are “ versions of fraud , ” said Nancy Wallace , a professor of finance and real estate at the Haas School of Business at the University of California-Berkeley . “ This kind of stuff is not OK . ”
New York City ’ s property tax forms state that the person signing them “ affirms the truth of the statements made ” and that “ false filings are subject to all applicable civil and criminal penalties . ”
The punishments for lying to tax officials , or to lenders , can be significant , ranging from fines to criminal fraud charges . Two former Trump associates , Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort , are serving prison time for offenses that include falsifying tax and bank records , some of them related to real estate .
“ Certainly , if I were sitting in a prosecutor ’ s office , I would want to ask a lot more questions , ” said Anne Milgram , a former attorney general for New Jersey who is now a professor at New York University School of Law .
Trump has previously been accused of manipulating numbers on his tax and loan documents , including by his former lawyer , Cohen . But Trump ’ s business is notoriously opaque , with records rarely surfacing , and up till now there ’ s been little documentary evidence supporting those claims .
That ’ s one reason that multiple governmental entities , including two congressional committees and the office of the Manhattan district attorney , have subpoenaed Donald Trump ’ s tax returns . Trump has resisted , taking his battles to federal courts in Washington and New York . And so the question of whether different parts of the government can see the president ’ s financial information is now playing out in two appeals courts and seems destined to make it to the U.S. Supreme Court . Add to that a Washington Post account of an IRS whistleblower claiming political interference in the handling of the president ’ s audit , and the result is what amounts to frenetic interest in one person ’ s tax returns .
███ obtained the property tax documents using New York ’ s Freedom of Information Law . The documents were public because Trump appealed his property tax bill for the buildings every year for nine years in a row , the extent of the available records . We compared the tax records with loan records that became public when Trump ’ s lender , Ladder Capital , sold the debt on his properties as part of mortgage-backed securities .
███ reviewed records for four properties : 40 Wall Street , the Trump International Hotel and Tower , 1290 Avenue of the Americas and Trump Tower . Discrepancies involving two of them — 40 Wall Street and the Trump International Hotel and Tower — stood out .
Trump ’ s personal attorney at the time , Michael Cohen , keeps watch as supporters lay hands on the then-presidential nominee . “ It was my experience that Mr. Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes , ” Cohen later testified , “ and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes. ” ( Jonathan Ernst/Reuters )
There can be legitimate reasons for numbers to diverge between tax and loan documents , the experts noted , but some of the gaps seemed to have no reasonable justification . “ It really feels like there ’ s two sets of books — it feels like a set of books for the tax guy and a set for the lender , ” said Kevin Riordan , a financing expert and real estate professor at Montclair State University who reviewed the records . “ It ’ s hard to argue numbers . That ’ s black and white . ”
The Trump Organization did not respond on the record to detailed questions provided by ███ . Robert Pollack , a lawyer whose firm , Marcus & Pollack , handles Trump ’ s property tax appeal filings with the city , said he was not authorized to discuss the documents . A spokeswoman for Mazars USA , the accounting firm that signed off on the two properties ’ expense and income statements , said the firm does not comment on its work for clients . Executives with Trump ’ s lender , Ladder Capital , declined to be quoted for the story .
In response to ███ ’ s questions about the disparities , Laura Feyer , deputy press secretary for New York Mayor Bill de Blasio , said of the Trump International Hotel and Tower , “ The city is looking into this property , and if there has been any underreporting , we will take appropriate action . ”
Taxes have long been a third rail for Trump . Long before he famously declined to make his personal returns public , a New York Times investigation concluded , Trump participated in tax schemes that involved “ outright fraud , ” and that he had formulated “ a strategy to undervalue his parents ’ real estate holdings by hundreds of millions of dollars on tax returns. ” Trump ’ s former partners in Panama claimed in a lawsuit , which is ongoing , that Trump ’ s hotel management company failed to pay taxes on millions in fees it received . Spokespeople for Trump and his company have denied any tax improprieties in the past .
In February , Cohen told Congress that Trump had adjusted figures up or down , as necessary , to obtain loans and avoid taxes . “ It was my experience that Mr. Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes , ” Cohen testified , “ and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes . ”
The two Trump buildings with the most notable discrepancies shared a financial trait : Both were refinanced in 2015 and 2016 while Trump was campaigning for president . The loan for 40 Wall Street — $ 160 million — was then the Trump Organization ’ s biggest debt .
The fortunes of 40 Wall Street have risen and fallen repeatedly since it was constructed in 1930 . Once briefly in the running to become the world ’ s tallest skyscraper ( before being eclipsed by the Chrysler Building and then others ) , the 71-story landmark had an illustrious history before falling into disrepair as it changed hands multiple times .
Trump says in his book “ Never Give Up ” that he took over 40 Wall Street for $ 1 million during a down market in 1995 . Others have reported the price as $ 10 million . Trump gave the property his signature treatment , decking out the lobby in Italian marble and bronze and christening it “ The Trump Building. ” Tenants such as American Express moved in .
But the rent rolls suffered when big-name tenants fled to Midtown in the years after the Sept. 11 attacks . Less blue-chip operations replaced them . In recent years , there were more setbacks . About two years ago , for example , high-end food purveyor Dean & Deluca canceled plans to locate an 18,500-square-foot emporium on the higher-priced first floor . The space remains empty .
The building at 40 Wall was underperforming , charging below-market rents , according to credit-rating agency Moody ’ s . Its profits were lagging .
Trump ’ s company , which has sometimes struggled to obtain credit because of his history of bankruptcies and defaults , turned for relief to a financial institution where Donald Trump had a connection : Ladder Capital , which employs Jack Weisselberg , the son of the Trump Organization ’ s longtime CFO , Allen Weisselberg . Ladder is a publicly traded commercial real estate investment trust that reports more than $ 6 billion in assets . In 2015 , and still today , Jack Weisselberg was an executive director whose job was to make loans .
Trump and Jack Weisselberg had history together . Jack was at UBS , in its loan origination department , in 2006 , when the Swiss bank loaned Trump $ 7 million for his piece of the Trump International Hotel and Tower . Allen Weisselberg had bought a condo from Trump in one of his buildings for a below-market price of $ 152,500 in 2000 . He deeded it to Jack three years later for about $ 148,000 . Jack sold the unit for more than three times as much in 2006 . ( Jack Weisselberg declined to comment on Ladder ’ s loans or his relationship with the Trump Organization . )
Even with a sympathetic lender , the struggles at 40 Wall Street would normally raise questions . Trump ’ s representatives needed to demonstrate signs of the building ’ s financial health if they wanted a new loan with a lower interest rate .
They had a compelling piece of data , it seemed . Trump ’ s team told Ladder that occupancy was rebounding after registering a lackluster 58.9 % on Dec. 31 , 2012 . Since then , Trump representatives reported , the building had signed new tenants . Income from them hadn ’ t fully been realized yet , largely because of free-rent deals , they said . But after 2015 , they predicted , revenues would surge .
“ That ’ s a selling point for people in the business , ” said Riordan , who was previously the executive director of the Rutgers Center for Real Estate . Borrowers “ want to show tremendous leasing momentum. ” The steepness of such a rise in occupancy at the Trump building was unusual , Riordan and other experts said .
Documents submitted to city property tax officials show no such run-up . Trump representatives reported to the tax authorities that the building was already 81 % leased in 2012 .
“ What is bizarre is that you have these tax filings that are totally different , ” Riordan said . A gap of at least 10 percentage points between the two occupancy reports persisted for the next two years , before the figures in the tax and loan reports synced in January 2016 .
The portrayal of a rapid rise in occupancy , and the explanation that income would soon follow , were critical for the refinancing . Indeed , Ladder ’ s underwriters were predicting that 40 Wall Street ’ s profits would more than double after 2015 . Having reviewed Trump ’ s financial statements and rent roll , they estimated the building would clear $ 22.6 million a year in net operating income .
Ladder needed credit ratings agencies like Moody ’ s and Fitch to endorse its income expectations and give the loan a favorable rating , which would in turn make it easier for the next step of the plan : to package the loan as part of a bond , a so-called commercial mortgage-backed security , and sell it to investors . Without the expected rise in income , Riordan said , the loan size or terms would likely have needed to be renegotiated to satisfy the ratings agencies and investors , which would mean less favorable terms for Trump and Ladder . “ There was a story crafted here , ” Riordan said . “ It ’ s contradicted by what we see in the tax filings . ”
Wallace , the University of California professor , added : “ Especially in underwriting loans , you are supposed to truthfully report. ” Both the lender and the borrower are required to supply accurate information , she said .
Moody ’ s and Fitch analysts found the underwriter ’ s projections slightly too rosy , but Fitch conferred an investment-grade rating on the loan , allowing it to proceed as planned . Trump ultimately received a 10-year loan with a lower interest rate than the building previously had as well as terms that would allow him to defer paying off much of the principal until the end of the loan .
Once granted , the loan to 40 Wall Street ran into trouble : The year after it went through , the loan servicer put it on a “ watch list ” because of concerns that the building wasn ’ t making sufficient profit to pay the debt service with enough of a margin . It stayed on the list for three months . ( Trump ’ s company has continued making payments . )
As of 2018 , the most recent year available , the building had never met the underwriters ’ profit expectations , trailing by more than 8 % , according to data from commercial real estate research service Trepp . Experts say that , given the amount of research underwriters do , a property typically meets their expectations fairly quickly .
The 40 Wall Street documents contain discrepancies related to costs as well as to occupancy . Generally , there are “ more opportunities to play games on the expense side , ” said Ron Shapiro , an assistant professor at Rutgers Business School and a former bank senior vice president , “ particularly because there are many more kinds of expenses . ”
Comparing specific expense items in both sets of records is challenging , because accountants may group categories differently in reports to tax and loan officials . But some differences on 40 Wall Street documents elicit head-scratching .
For example , insurance costs in 2017 were listed as $ 744,521 in tax documents and $ 457,414 in loan records .
Then there was the underlying lease . Trump technically doesn ’ t own 40 Wall Street . He pays the wealthy German family that owns the property for the right to rent the building to tenants . In 2015 , both Trump ’ s report to tax authorities and a key loan disclosure document asserted that Trump ’ s company paid $ 1.65 million for these rights that year . But a line-by-line income and expense statement , which Trepp gathered from what the company reported to the loan servicer , reported the company paid about $ 1.24 million that year .
“ I don ’ t know why that would be off , ” said Jason Hoffman , who is chair of the real estate committee for a professional association of certified public accountants in New York state . Like other experts , he said there are legitimate reasons why tax and loan filings might not line up perfectly . But Hoffman said the firm where he works makes sure the numbers match when it prepares both tax and loan documents for a client — or that it can explain why if they don ’ t .
Financial information for the Trump International Hotel and Tower raises similar questions . Trump owns only a small portion of the building , which is located on Columbus Circle : two commercial spaces , which he rents out to a restaurant and a parking garage . Trump ’ s company told New York City tax officials it made about $ 822,000 renting space to commercial tenants there in 2017 , records show . The company told loan officials it took in $ 1.67 million that year — more than twice as much . In eight years of data ███ examined for the Columbus Circle property , Trump ’ s company reported gross income to tax authorities that was typically only about 81 % of what it reported to the lender .
Trump appeared to omit from tax documents income his company received from leasing space on the roof for television antennas , a ███ review found . The line on tax appeal forms for income from such communications equipment is blank on nine years of tax filings , even as loan documents listed the antennas as major sources of income .
Trump has an easement to lease the roof space ; he doesn ’ t own it . But three tax experts , including Melanie Brock , an appraiser and paralegal who has worked on hundreds of New York City tax cases , told ███ that the income should still be reported on the tax appeals forms .
It ’ s hard to guess what might explain every inconsistency , said David Wilkes , a New York City tax lawyer who is chair of the National Association of Property Tax Attorneys . But , he added , “ My gut reaction is it seems like there ’ s something amiss there . ”
Tax records for Trump personally and for his business continue to be subjects of contention in multiple investigations . The Justice Department has intervened in the investigation by the Manhattan district attorney , whose office has sought Trump ’ s personal tax returns . Congressional lawmakers investigating his business dealings have sought documents from his longtime accountant , Donald Bender , a partner at Mazars . Trump is fighting the subpoenas in court . ( Bender did not respond to requests for comment . )
Rep. Elijah Cummings , D-Md. , chairman of the House Oversight Committee , has said the committee is seeking to determine if Cohen ’ s testimony about Trump inflating and deflating his assets was accurate . Cummings asked for Mazars ’ records related to Trump entities , as well as communications between Bender and Trump or Trump employees since 2009 .
Such communications , the subpoena stated , should include any related to potential concerns that information Trump or his representatives provided his accountants was “ incomplete , inaccurate , or otherwise unsatisfactory . ”","Trump Administration The 45th President and His Administration

And so the question of whether different parts of the government can see the president’s financial information is now playing out in two appeals courts and seems destined to make it to the U.S. Supreme Court. Add to that a Washington Post account of an IRS whistleblower claiming political interference in the handling of the president’s audit, and the result is what amounts to frenetic interest in one person’s tax returns.

ProPublica obtained the property tax documents using New York’s Freedom of Information Law. The documents were public because Trump appealed his property tax bill for the buildings every year for nine years in a row, the extent of the available records. We compared the tax records with loan records that became public when Trump’s lender, Ladder Capital, sold the debt on his properties as part of mortgage-backed securities.

ProPublica reviewed records for four properties: 40 Wall Street, the Trump International Hotel and Tower, 1290 Avenue of the Americas and Trump Tower. Discrepancies involving two of them — 40 Wall Street and the Trump International Hotel and Tower — stood out.

There can be legitimate reasons for numbers to diverge between tax and loan documents, the experts noted, but some of the gaps seemed to have no reasonable justification. “It really feels like there’s two sets of books — it feels like a set of books for the tax guy and a set for the lender,” said Kevin Riordan, a financing expert and real estate professor at Montclair State University who reviewed the records. “It’s hard to argue numbers. That’s black and white.”

The Trump Organization did not respond on the record to detailed questions provided by ProPublica. Robert Pollack, a lawyer whose firm, Marcus & Pollack, handles Trump’s property tax appeal filings with the city, said he was not authorized to discuss the documents. A spokeswoman for Mazars USA, the accounting firm that signed off on the two properties’ expense and income statements, said the firm does not comment on its work for clients. Executives with Trump’s lender, Ladder Capital, declined to be quoted for the story.

In response to ProPublica’s questions about the disparities, Laura Feyer, deputy press secretary for New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, said of the Trump International Hotel and Tower, “The city is looking into this property, and if there has been any underreporting, we will take appropriate action.”

Taxes have long been a third rail for Trump. Long before he famously declined to make his personal returns public, a New York Times investigation concluded, Trump participated in tax schemes that involved “outright fraud,” and that he had formulated “a strategy to undervalue his parents’ real estate holdings by hundreds of millions of dollars on tax returns.” Trump’s former partners in Panama claimed in a lawsuit, which is ongoing, that Trump’s hotel management company failed to pay taxes on millions in fees it received. Spokespeople for Trump and his company have denied any tax improprieties in the past.

In February, Cohen told Congress that Trump had adjusted figures up or down, as necessary, to obtain loans and avoid taxes. “It was my experience that Mr. Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes,” Cohen testified, “and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes.”

The two Trump buildings with the most notable discrepancies shared a financial trait: Both were refinanced in 2015 and 2016 while Trump was campaigning for president. The loan for 40 Wall Street — $160 million — was then the Trump Organization’s biggest debt.

The fortunes of 40 Wall Street have risen and fallen repeatedly since it was constructed in 1930. Once briefly in the running to become the world’s tallest skyscraper (before being eclipsed by the Chrysler Building and then others), the 71-story landmark had an illustrious history before falling into disrepair as it changed hands multiple times.

Trump says in his book “Never Give Up” that he took over 40 Wall Street for $1 million during a down market in 1995. Others have reported the price as $10 million. Trump gave the property his signature treatment, decking out the lobby in Italian marble and bronze and christening it “The Trump Building.” Tenants such as American Express moved in.

But the rent rolls suffered when big-name tenants fled to Midtown in the years after the Sept. 11 attacks. Less blue-chip operations replaced them. In recent years, there were more setbacks. About two years ago, for example, high-end food purveyor Dean & Deluca canceled plans to locate an 18,500-square-foot emporium on the higher-priced first floor. The space remains empty.

The building at 40 Wall was underperforming, charging below-market rents, according to credit-rating agency Moody’s. Its profits were lagging.

Trump’s company, which has sometimes struggled to obtain credit because of his history of bankruptcies and defaults, turned for relief to a financial institution where Donald Trump had a connection: Ladder Capital, which employs Jack Weisselberg, the son of the Trump Organization’s longtime CFO, Allen Weisselberg. Ladder is a publicly traded commercial real estate investment trust that reports more than $6 billion in assets. In 2015, and still today, Jack Weisselberg was an executive director whose job was to make loans.

Trump and Jack Weisselberg had history together. Jack was at UBS, in its loan origination department, in 2006, when the Swiss bank loaned Trump $7 million for his piece of the Trump International Hotel and Tower. Allen Weisselberg had bought a condo from Trump in one of his buildings for a below-market price of $152,500 in 2000. He deeded it to Jack three years later for about $148,000. Jack sold the unit for more than three times as much in 2006. (Jack Weisselberg declined to comment on Ladder’s loans or his relationship with the Trump Organization.)

Even with a sympathetic lender, the struggles at 40 Wall Street would normally raise questions. Trump’s representatives needed to demonstrate signs of the building’s financial health if they wanted a new loan with a lower interest rate.

They had a compelling piece of data, it seemed. Trump’s team told Ladder that occupancy was rebounding after registering a lackluster 58.9% on Dec. 31, 2012. Since then, Trump representatives reported, the building had signed new tenants. Income from them hadn’t fully been realized yet, largely because of free-rent deals, they said. But after 2015, they predicted, revenues would surge.

“That’s a selling point for people in the business,” said Riordan, who was previously the executive director of the Rutgers Center for Real Estate. Borrowers “want to show tremendous leasing momentum.” The steepness of such a rise in occupancy at the Trump building was unusual, Riordan and other experts said.

Documents submitted to city property tax officials show no such run-up. Trump representatives reported to the tax authorities that the building was already 81% leased in 2012.

“What is bizarre is that you have these tax filings that are totally different,” Riordan said. A gap of at least 10 percentage points between the two occupancy reports persisted for the next two years, before the figures in the tax and loan reports synced in January 2016.

The portrayal of a rapid rise in occupancy, and the explanation that income would soon follow, were critical for the refinancing. Indeed, Ladder’s underwriters were predicting that 40 Wall Street’s profits would more than double after 2015. Having reviewed Trump’s financial statements and rent roll, they estimated the building would clear $22.6 million a year in net operating income.

Ladder needed credit ratings agencies like Moody’s and Fitch to endorse its income expectations and give the loan a favorable rating, which would in turn make it easier for the next step of the plan: to package the loan as part of a bond, a so-called commercial mortgage-backed security, and sell it to investors. Without the expected rise in income, Riordan said, the loan size or terms would likely have needed to be renegotiated to satisfy the ratings agencies and investors, which would mean less favorable terms for Trump and Ladder. “There was a story crafted here,” Riordan said. “It’s contradicted by what we see in the tax filings.”

Wallace, the University of California professor, added: “Especially in underwriting loans, you are supposed to truthfully report.” Both the lender and the borrower are required to supply accurate information, she said.

Moody’s and Fitch analysts found the underwriter’s projections slightly too rosy, but Fitch conferred an investment-grade rating on the loan, allowing it to proceed as planned. Trump ultimately received a 10-year loan with a lower interest rate than the building previously had as well as terms that would allow him to defer paying off much of the principal until the end of the loan.

Once granted, the loan to 40 Wall Street ran into trouble: The year after it went through, the loan servicer put it on a “watch list” because of concerns that the building wasn’t making sufficient profit to pay the debt service with enough of a margin. It stayed on the list for three months. (Trump’s company has continued making payments.)

As of 2018, the most recent year available, the building had never met the underwriters’ profit expectations, trailing by more than 8%, according to data from commercial real estate research service Trepp. Experts say that, given the amount of research underwriters do, a property typically meets their expectations fairly quickly.

The 40 Wall Street documents contain discrepancies related to costs as well as to occupancy. Generally, there are “more opportunities to play games on the expense side,” said Ron Shapiro, an assistant professor at Rutgers Business School and a former bank senior vice president, “particularly because there are many more kinds of expenses.”

Comparing specific expense items in both sets of records is challenging, because accountants may group categories differently in reports to tax and loan officials. But some differences on 40 Wall Street documents elicit head-scratching.

For example, insurance costs in 2017 were listed as $744,521 in tax documents and $457,414 in loan records.

Then there was the underlying lease. Trump technically doesn’t own 40 Wall Street. He pays the wealthy German family that owns the property for the right to rent the building to tenants. In 2015, both Trump’s report to tax authorities and a key loan disclosure document asserted that Trump’s company paid $1.65 million for these rights that year. But a line-by-line income and expense statement, which Trepp gathered from what the company reported to the loan servicer, reported the company paid about $1.24 million that year.

“I don’t know why that would be off,” said Jason Hoffman, who is chair of the real estate committee for a professional association of certified public accountants in New York state. Like other experts, he said there are legitimate reasons why tax and loan filings might not line up perfectly. But Hoffman said the firm where he works makes sure the numbers match when it prepares both tax and loan documents for a client — or that it can explain why if they don’t.

Financial information for the Trump International Hotel and Tower raises similar questions. Trump owns only a small portion of the building, which is located on Columbus Circle: two commercial spaces, which he rents out to a restaurant and a parking garage. Trump’s company told New York City tax officials it made about $822,000 renting space to commercial tenants there in 2017, records show. The company told loan officials it took in $1.67 million that year — more than twice as much. In eight years of data ProPublica examined for the Columbus Circle property, Trump’s company reported gross income to tax authorities that was typically only about 81% of what it reported to the lender.

Trump appeared to omit from tax documents income his company received from leasing space on the roof for television antennas, a ProPublica review found. The line on tax appeal forms for income from such communications equipment is blank on nine years of tax filings, even as loan documents listed the antennas as major sources of income.

Trump has an easement to lease the roof space; he doesn’t own it. But three tax experts, including Melanie Brock, an appraiser and paralegal who has worked on hundreds of New York City tax cases, told ProPublica that the income should still be reported on the tax appeals forms.

It’s hard to guess what might explain every inconsistency, said David Wilkes, a New York City tax lawyer who is chair of the National Association of Property Tax Attorneys. But, he added, “My gut reaction is it seems like there’s something amiss there.”

Tax records for Trump personally and for his business continue to be subjects of contention in multiple investigations. The Justice Department has intervened in the investigation by the Manhattan district attorney, whose office has sought Trump’s personal tax returns. Congressional lawmakers investigating his business dealings have sought documents from his longtime accountant, Donald Bender, a partner at Mazars. Trump is fighting the subpoenas in court. (Bender did not respond to requests for comment.)

Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., chairman of the House Oversight Committee, has said the committee is seeking to determine if Cohen’s testimony about Trump inflating and deflating his assets was accurate. Cummings asked for Mazars’ records related to Trump entities, as well as communications between Bender and Trump or Trump employees since 2009.

Such communications, the subpoena stated, should include any related to potential concerns that information Trump or his representatives provided his accountants was “incomplete, inaccurate, or otherwise unsatisfactory.”",www.propublica.org,center,EsNsk7ZhWgf9sgDw

taxes,Washington Times,2,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/nov/14/tax-bills-benefit-muffled-by-democrat-cries-on-sal/,Democrats cry foul about loss of deduction to muddle tax bill’s real benefits to middle class,2017-11-14,S.A. Miller,"Even after losing the state and local income tax deduction , taxpayers in New York and other high-tax blue states would still end up ahead under the Republican tax reform bill , analysts say .
But that message is having a tough time breaking through the din in Washington .
Democrats have seized on the state and local tax deduction , or SALT , as their chief argument against the tax code overhaul , warning of an electoral backlash from middle-class suburbanites against Republicans if the plan is approved .
There is one problem : SALT is not a middle-class tax break . The benefit of the write-off goes overwhelmingly to high-income earners in high-tax blue states , several economists said .
“ SALT is a classic tax preference for the rich that Democrats should be opposing , ” said Brian Riedl , an economist at the conservative-leaning Manhattan Institute who has been studying the tax reform plans .
“ The Democrats ’ complaints are overheated , ” he said . “ Half of the benefits go to the richest 5 percent of earners , and nearly all families who would see their SALT deduction limited would receive bigger tax cuts elsewhere . ”
An analysis of the Senate bill , which eliminates SALT , would deliver higher after-tax income by the end of the decade in high-tax states such as California , New York and New Jersey .
Middle-class families would have an estimated gain in after-tax income of $ 3,013 in New Jersey , $ 2,932 in California , $ 2,703 in New York and $ 2,701 in Illinois , according to a study by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation .

But that message is having a tough time breaking through the din in Washington.

Democrats have seized on the state and local tax deduction, or SALT, as their chief argument against the tax code overhaul, warning of an electoral backlash from middle-class suburbanites against Republicans if the plan is approved.

There is one problem: SALT is not a middle-class tax break. The benefit of the write-off goes overwhelmingly to high-income earners in high-tax blue states, several economists said.

“SALT is a classic tax preference for the rich that Democrats should be opposing,” said Brian Riedl, an economist at the conservative-leaning Manhattan Institute who has been studying the tax reform plans.

“The Democrats’ complaints are overheated,” he said. “Half of the benefits go to the richest 5 percent of earners, and nearly all families who would see their SALT deduction limited would receive bigger tax cuts elsewhere.”

An analysis of the Senate bill, which eliminates SALT, would deliver higher after-tax income by the end of the decade in high-tax states such as California, New York and New Jersey.

Middle-class families would have an estimated gain in after-tax income of $3,013 in New Jersey, $2,932 in California, $2,703 in New York and $2,701 in Illinois, according to a study by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.

Nicole M. Kaeding, one of the economists behind the Tax Foundation analysis, stressed that 90 percent of those claiming SALT deductions make more than $100,000 a year.

“These individuals are not middle-class individuals. They are in the top 20 percent of all income earners. Even in New York City, median household income is $78,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau,” she said.

Republicans promised they would further unshackle a growing economy , and they have been rewarded with economic growth of 4.2 percent in the second quarter of this year .
But the tax cuts have not paid big political dividends for Republicans to date , and there is a growing pile of evidence that suggests Democrats are winning the current political debate over the measure . A poll commissioned by the Republican National Committee on Trump 's tax law , obtained and published by Bloomberg last week , found that most voters say the tax law benefits corporations and wealthy individuals more than the middle class .

Several senior White House officials said Trump was especially interested in significantly lowering the corporate tax rate and getting the bill done in 2017 .

In fall of last year , lobbyists started hearing that Republicans were considering a sharp cut in pre-tax 401 ( k ) contribution limits . The idea immediately attracted negative media attention .
At 7:42 a.m on Oct. 23 , 2017 , Trump buried the idea with one tweet : “ There will be NO change to your 401 ( k ) . This has always been a great and popular middle class tax break that works , and it stays ! ”

For years , Republicans had been pushing a revenue neutral tax reform and the Ryan/Brady border adjustment plan , first proposed in June 2016 as part of the Speaker ’ s “ Better Way ” agenda , would raise $ 1 trillion to pay for the entire package . Specifically , the Better Way plan aimed to stop companies from moving their headquarters , jobs and intellectual property overseas by pairing territoriality with a “ border adjustment ” provision to tax imports and exempt exports . Under the border adjustment proposal , goods consumed in the U.S. would be subject to U.S. taxes no matter where they are made .

Toomey added that the hostility to the border adjustment proposal was “ widespread and very vociferous . ”
“ It was immediately clear to me this has no chance of surviving , ” Toomey recalled . “ That also underscored , of course , the need for this to not be revenue neutral . That was a trillion dollars worth of revenue that in the House [ plan ] is not going to happen . ”
Sen. David Perdue ( R-Ga. ) , one of the earliest senators to come out against the proposal , said that he thought House members ’ explanation of why the border tax would work was “ not correct . ”
“ There were a lot of people that didn ’ t know a lot about border adjustment tax , and once we had that kind of open dialogue in Congress , you saw a lot of people sort of gravitating to be against it , ” he said .

Retailers mobilized quickly to advocate against the proposal because they were worried it would lead to higher prices on goods . By the end of February , retailers were confident that there were enough senators who opposed the tax to torpedo the idea .
Even on the House side — and within the Ways and Means Committee — there were concerns with the proposal .

Kelly , a car dealership owner , said he started thinking about Monroney labels , which are stickers on new cars that mention the percentage of parts made in various countries . Kelly brought in the Monroney labels to show lawmakers that fall as part of an effort to express concerns about how a border adjustment tax might increase the price of cars .
“ We ’ re not talking about dollars , we ’ re talking about thousands of dollars , ” Kelly said .
In March 2017 , Kelly went on TV and publicly came out against the tax . He told ███ he would never have been able to get to `` yes '' on the proposal .
Renacci , who is running for the Senate , expressed reservations about the tax early on . He worried that it would hurt businesses in his state .
“ I was willing to listen , ” he said . “ I was not comfortable with the border adjustment tax but I was not writing it off entirely . I had asked for a hearing at one point in time so we could get some outside information . ”
But at some point , Renacci said , he made it “ public within the family ” that he wouldn ’ t support the plan .
For the most part , Brady and Ryan stood firm in support of their proposal .
“ We talked to Ryan and Brady frequently , we talked to their staffs frequently . They weren ’ t budging , ” said David French , senior vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation .
Club for Growth President David McIntosh said Ryan and Brady were “ completely tone deaf ” to the arguments against the tax .
But a former senior House GOP aide countered that both legislators were open to letting go of the border plan if there was a viable alternative .
Ryan and Brady had hoped Trump would endorse it , but the White House was careful with what they said about the plan publicly . And behind the scenes , various Trump aides were divided about the proposal .
“ It was too controversial to find 51 Republican senators to support that , '' former White House Legislative Affairs Director Marc Short told ███ . “ So there is a policy argument about it , but there was also just the political reality that we can debate this all night long , but it 's not going to get 51 votes . So , why are we continuing to kick this around ? ''
Cohn opposed the border tax and opponents of the proposal got the sense from their meetings with him that he was in their corner .
Trump held a series of meetings on an array of topics with business leaders during the early months of his presidency , including with retailers and major exporters .
On Feb. 15 , 2017 , Trump huddled with more than a half dozen retail CEOs . When one executive in the room said the border adjustment tax would make the company ’ s tax rate 120 percent , Trump replied something along the lines of , “ That ’ s not good , ” according to Brian Dodge , senior executive vice president of public affairs for the Retail Industry Leaders Association , who was briefed on the meeting .
Executives who attended the meeting came away with the strong sense that Trump knew the difference between tariffs , which he was interested in , and Ryan ’ s idea . The president “ was not embracing border adjustment tax at that point , and ... we had an opportunity to keep the White House from embracing the idea , ” Dodge said .
`` The president did n't support it . He made it very clear , and so , you know , that was initially a big part of paying for the bill . And ultimately he became very clear that was n't going to be in the bill , ” House Majority Whip Steve Scalise ( R-La . ) said . “ And so Brady and his team went back to work . ''
Shortly before the White House 's one-page plan was unveiled in April 2017 , Mnuchin and Cohn briefed several groups about it . Mnuchin first gave a “ long , careful ” answer about why the Ryan/Brady provision wasn ’ t in the plan . Then Cohn said , “ It ’ s dead , ” a key source stated .
After months of pushback on the tax from lawmakers , retailers and conservative groups , Brady proposed phasing in the proposal over five years . But that didn ’ t ease any of the opponents ’ concerns .
Brady subsequently convened a hearing on the topic in May 2017 , which some involved in the tax process viewed as a turning point .
Besides Renacci and Kelly , Tiberi and Rep. Erik Paulsen Erik Philip PaulsenTwo swing-district Democrats raise impeachment calls after whistleblower reports Hopes dim for passage of Trump trade deal Fight over Trump 's new NAFTA hits key stretch MORE ( R-Minn. ) , one of Brady ’ s roommates , expressed concerns about the concept at the hearing .
“ Paulsen , that was the first time [ his opposition ] became public , ” Renacci said .
Democrats this fall are targeting Paulsen , whose district was won by Clinton in 2016 . Paulsen has doubled down on the tax cuts and has touted the new law repeatedly in his reelection campaign .
Brady said he still thinks border adjustability is a “ game changing ” idea that would “ level the playing field for American companies. ” He added the plan might have gotten more support if lawmakers had several years to examine it .
But Brady said that by about June 2017 , it became clear that the blueprint was dividing the business community and lawmakers .
“ It was clear it needed to be set aside , that we needed to find a way to level the playing field internationally without it , ” he said .
Brady added that he and Ryan did n't shelve it until they got a commitment from the other key tax negotiators that there would be an alternative way to address the erosion of the U.S. tax base .
The border adjustment was formally scrapped in July 2017 in a statement released by the “ Big Six ” — Ryan , Brady , Mnuchin , Cohn , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison ( Mitch ) Mitchell McConnellMcConnell : Communist Party 's methods a 'tragedy ' for Chinese people Trump congratulates China on anniversary as GOP lawmakers decry communist rule Appeals court upholds net neutrality repeal but rules FCC ca n't block state laws MORE ( R-Ky. ) and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch Orrin Grant HatchTrump to award racing legend Roger Penske with Presidential Medal of Freedom Trump awards Presidential Medal of Freedom to economist , former Reagan adviser Arthur Laffer Second ex-Senate staffer charged in aiding doxxing of GOP senators MORE ( R-Utah ) .
Retailers and conservative groups that had focused their energy on killing the plan , switched gears and started to promote an overhaul of the tax code . And Republican lawmakers started to become more productive .
The Big Six statement came hours before Senate Republicans ’ efforts to repeal ObamaCare fell short . That failure prompted Republicans and outside groups to be even more motivated to enact tax legislation .
Renacci recalled that when Ways and Means Committee Republicans held a retreat in September , “ you could start to see there were some principles that were starting to come forward . There were some agreements starting to be made on many of the issues between members of the Ways and Means Committee , and I think that it started to gel . ”
“ I actually think once the border adjustment was taken out of the mix , you started to see this plan starting to gel more and more , ” he said .

Trump's role on tax reform

Trying to raise money for tax reform

For years, Republicans had been pushing a revenue neutral tax reform and the Ryan/Brady border adjustment plan, first proposed in June 2016 as part of the Speaker’s “Better Way” agenda, would raise $1 trillion to pay for the entire package. Specifically, the Better Way plan aimed to stop companies from moving their headquarters, jobs and intellectual property overseas by pairing territoriality with a “border adjustment” provision to tax imports and exempt exports. Under the border adjustment proposal, goods consumed in the U.S. would be subject to U.S. taxes no matter where they are made.

Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), one of the earliest senators to come out against the proposal, said that he thought House members’ explanation of why the border tax would work was “not correct.”

“There were a lot of people that didn’t know a lot about border adjustment tax, and once we had that kind of open dialogue in Congress, you saw a lot of people sort of gravitating to be against it,” he said.

In February 2017, Sen. Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamDemocrats warn GOP, Trump putting whistleblower safety at risk GOP uneasy with Giuliani The Hill's 12:30 Report: Pompeo, Barr drawn into Ukraine web MORE (R-S.C.) said the House border tax plan ""won't get 10 votes in the Senate.""

Retailers mobilized quickly to advocate against the proposal because they were worried it would lead to higher prices on goods. By the end of February, retailers were confident that there were enough senators who opposed the tax to torpedo the idea.

Even on the House side — and within the Ways and Means Committee — there were concerns with the proposal.

In summer 2016, GOP Reps. Pat Tiberi Patrick (Pat) Joseph TiberiOhio New Members 2019 Many authors of GOP tax law will not be returning to Congress GOP Rep. Balderson holds onto seat in Ohio MORE (Ohio), who has since left Congress, Mike Kelly George (Mike) Joseph KellyHouse votes to repeal ObamaCare's 'Cadillac tax' GOP lawmaker: 'I'm a person of color.

RenacciMedicare for All won't deliver what Democrats promise GOP rep: If Mueller had found collusion, 'investigation would have wrapped up very quickly' House Ethics Committee extends probe into Renacci MORE (Ohio) were leaving a meeting when they started talking about the border adjustment proposal. Kelly, a car dealership owner, said he started thinking about Monroney labels, which are stickers on new cars that mention the percentage of parts made in various countries. Kelly brought in the Monroney labels to show lawmakers that fall as part of an effort to express concerns about how a border adjustment tax might increase the price of cars.

“We’re not talking about dollars, we’re talking about thousands of dollars,” Kelly said.

In March 2017, Kelly went on TV and publicly came out against the tax. He told The Hill he would never have been able to get to ""yes"" on the proposal.

Renacci, who is running for the Senate, expressed reservations about the tax early on. He worried that it would hurt businesses in his state.

“I was willing to listen,” he said. “I was not comfortable with the border adjustment tax but I was not writing it off entirely. I had asked for a hearing at one point in time so we could get some outside information.”

But at some point, Renacci said, he made it “public within the family” that he wouldn’t support the plan.

For the most part, Brady and Ryan stood firm in support of their proposal.

“We talked to Ryan and Brady frequently, we talked to their staffs frequently. They weren’t budging,” said David French, senior vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation.

Club for Growth President David McIntosh said Ryan and Brady were “completely tone deaf” to the arguments against the tax.

But a former senior House GOP aide countered that both legislators were open to letting go of the border plan if there was a viable alternative.

Ryan and Brady had hoped Trump would endorse it, but the White House was careful with what they said about the plan publicly. And behind the scenes, various Trump aides were divided about the proposal.

“It was too controversial to find 51 Republican senators to support that,"" former White House Legislative Affairs Director Marc Short told The Hill. “So there is a policy argument about it, but there was also just the political reality that we can debate this all night long, but it's not going to get 51 votes. So, why are we continuing to kick this around?""

Cohn opposed the border tax and opponents of the proposal got the sense from their meetings with him that he was in their corner.

Lobbying Trump

Trump held a series of meetings on an array of topics with business leaders during the early months of his presidency, including with retailers and major exporters.

On Feb. 15, 2017, Trump huddled with more than a half dozen retail CEOs. When one executive in the room said the border adjustment tax would make the company’s tax rate 120 percent, Trump replied something along the lines of, “That’s not good,” according to Brian Dodge, senior executive vice president of public affairs for the Retail Industry Leaders Association, who was briefed on the meeting.

Executives who attended the meeting came away with the strong sense that Trump knew the difference between tariffs, which he was interested in, and Ryan’s idea. The president “was not embracing border adjustment tax at that point, and ... we had an opportunity to keep the White House from embracing the idea,” Dodge said.

""The president didn't support it. He made it very clear, and so, you know, that was initially a big part of paying for the bill. And ultimately he became very clear that wasn't going to be in the bill,” House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) said. “And so Brady and his team went back to work.""

Shortly before the White House's one-page plan was unveiled in April 2017, Mnuchin and Cohn briefed several groups about it. Mnuchin first gave a “long, careful” answer about why the Ryan/Brady provision wasn’t in the plan. Then Cohn said, “It’s dead,” a key source stated.

After months of pushback on the tax from lawmakers, retailers and conservative groups, Brady proposed phasing in the proposal over five years. But that didn’t ease any of the opponents’ concerns.

Brady subsequently convened a hearing on the topic in May 2017, which some involved in the tax process viewed as a turning point.

Besides Renacci and Kelly, Tiberi and Rep. Erik Paulsen Erik Philip PaulsenTwo swing-district Democrats raise impeachment calls after whistleblower reports Hopes dim for passage of Trump trade deal Fight over Trump's new NAFTA hits key stretch MORE (R-Minn.), one of Brady’s roommates, expressed concerns about the concept at the hearing.

“Paulsen, that was the first time [his opposition] became public,” Renacci said.

Democrats this fall are targeting Paulsen, whose district was won by Clinton in 2016. Paulsen has doubled down on the tax cuts and has touted the new law repeatedly in his reelection campaign.

Brady said he still thinks border adjustability is a “game changing” idea that would “level the playing field for American companies.” He added the plan might have gotten more support if lawmakers had several years to examine it.

But Brady said that by about June 2017, it became clear that the blueprint was dividing the business community and lawmakers.

“It was clear it needed to be set aside, that we needed to find a way to level the playing field internationally without it,” he said.

Brady added that he and Ryan didn't shelve it until they got a commitment from the other key tax negotiators that there would be an alternative way to address the erosion of the U.S. tax base.

The border adjustment was formally scrapped in July 2017 in a statement released by the “Big Six” — Ryan, Brady, Mnuchin, Cohn, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellMcConnell: Communist Party's methods a 'tragedy' for Chinese people Trump congratulates China on anniversary as GOP lawmakers decry communist rule Appeals court upholds net neutrality repeal but rules FCC can't block state laws MORE (R-Ky.) and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch Orrin Grant HatchTrump to award racing legend Roger Penske with Presidential Medal of Freedom Trump awards Presidential Medal of Freedom to economist, former Reagan adviser Arthur Laffer Second ex-Senate staffer charged in aiding doxxing of GOP senators MORE (R-Utah).

Retailers and conservative groups that had focused their energy on killing the plan, switched gears and started to promote an overhaul of the tax code. And Republican lawmakers started to become more productive.

The Big Six statement came hours before Senate Republicans’ efforts to repeal ObamaCare fell short. That failure prompted Republicans and outside groups to be even more motivated to enact tax legislation.

Renacci recalled that when Ways and Means Committee Republicans held a retreat in September, “you could start to see there were some principles that were starting to come forward. There were some agreements starting to be made on many of the issues between members of the Ways and Means Committee, and I think that it started to gel.”

“I actually think once the border adjustment was taken out of the mix, you started to see this plan starting to gel more and more,” he said.

`` It will provide major tax relief for middle income and for most other Americans . There will be a major tax reduction , '' Trump said Monday at a press conference at Trump Tower in New York as he unveiled his plan to revamp the tax code . `` It 'll simplify the tax code , it 'll grow the American economy at a level that it has n't seen for decades . ''
The highly anticipated tax plan comes as Trump is being pressed to provide more details about how his administration would govern .
One of the biggest beneficiaries appears to be families that draw the smallest paychecks . Individuals that make less than $ 25,000 ( and $ 50,000 for married couples ) would pay no income taxes under Trump 's plan .
`` They get a new one page form to send the IRS saying , ' I win , ' '' reads Trump 's tax plan , referring to those households who will pay no federal income taxes .
But many of those families already pay no federal taxes . Roughly 45 % of American households will not owe any federal income taxes this year under the existing tax code , according to Tax Policy Center estimates . Trump said his plan will ensure a slightly larger share -- more than 50 % of households -- pay no federal income tax .
`` Some of what Mr. Trump has done in his press conference is just sell us on one of the better features of what our income tax already does , '' said Alan Cole , an economist at the Tax Foundation . `` It will probably add to the number of people who do n't have to pay any income tax . That was already true of many people and he 's just expanding the number of people . ''
Meanwhile , the proposal would also be a boon for the wealthiest Americans like Trump -- the top bracket includes individuals making $ 150,001 and more and couples making $ 300,001 and more -- who would pay an income tax rate of 25 % . That 's a dramatic cut from the current top rate of close to 40 % .
The tax cuts for top earners could open Trump up to charges of hypocrisy . The real estate magnate has surged to the top of the polls by touting a populist tone , lamenting that wealthy people like himself should pay more .
Asked at Monday 's press conference how his proposal would affect his own tax rate , Trump dodged the question , saying : `` We 're reducing taxes , but believe me , there will be people in the very upper echelon that wo n't be thrilled with this . ''
He also declined to say how much taxes he currently pays , only saying , `` I fight like hell to pay as little as possible . ''
Perhaps the most pressing question that Trump must answer is how he would raise enough revenue to offset his plan 's deep tax cuts , though he insisted Monday that his proposal would not add to the country 's debt or deficit .
The candidate says he would make up for the difference in a number of ways : killing certain deductions for the rich and creating incentives for U.S. companies to bring back cash currently held overseas , thereby boosting growth at home .
Roberton Williams , a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center , said Trump 's claim that his plan would be revenue neutral was `` hard to swallow . ''
`` On the corporate side the tax cut is very large . On the individual side it 's very large , '' Williams said . `` There just are n't enough tax breaks out there to make this work . ''
Trump 's tax plan broadly mirrors that of one of his main rivals : Jeb Bush .
Bush 's proposal released this month also reduces the number of income tax brackets -- to three from the current seven . The highest tax bracket under the former Florida governor 's plan is 28 % , and the lowest is 10 % . Bush also proposed lowering the corporate tax rate from 35 % to 20 % -- another popular idea among conservatives . Trump would go even further , lowering the rate to 15 % .
On Tuesday , Bush mocked Trump 's plan , tweeting that is `` looks familiar . ''
`` Finally saw Donald 's 'tax plan . ' Looks familiar ! I 'm flattered . But he should 've stuck with growth & fiscal responsibility , '' Bush said .
Finally saw Donald 's 'tax plan . ' Looks familiar ! I 'm flattered . But he should 've stuck with growth & fiscal responsibility . — Jeb Bush ( @ JebBush ) September 29 , 2015
Trump 's GOP rivals , including Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio , have clear objectives for their tax plan . But Trump 's is harder to parse , said Republican economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin .
Bush wants to spur growth and make it tougher to game the tax system , while Rubio wants to boost growth and aid families , he said .
As for Trump , `` I do n't know what he wants , '' Holtz-Eakin said . `` It looks like bits and pieces of other people 's plans strung together . ''
Like Bush , one loophole Trump would target is the preferential treatment for carried interest , which is a share of profits paid to investment managers .
Since launching his White House campaign in June , Trump has made sweeping attacks on hedge fund managers who are paid in carried interest .
Trump , who claims that his personal assets are valued at more than $ 10 billion , frequently makes the distinction between investors who work in real estate and those on Wall Street . Hedge fund managers , he often says , fall in the category of special interests backing some of his well-connected and best-funded rivals .
`` I know them . They all are supporting Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton , '' Trump told CNN at a campaign stop in Nashville , Tennessee , last month . `` They make a lot of money and a lot of it is luck . They pick a stock and all of a sudden they make a lot of money . I want the hedge fund guys to pay more taxes . ''
Still , the plan might not be too tough on Wall Street . Since Trump 's proposal would slash the income tax rate across the board , taxing carried interest as regular income under Trump 's plan would mean investors still pay far less than what they would if the carried interest loophole were done away with under the current tax code .
The tax rate of hedge fund managers is a favorite political target for the 2016 presidential candidates .
`` We will treat all noninvestment income the same , so unless you stake capital in an investment , you wo n't be able to claim the capital-gains tax rate on your market gains , '' Bush 's tax proposal said .

(CNN) – A new plan from President Barack Obama that would alter the corporate tax code while investing in job creation is a deal that any ""serious"" lawmaker could sign onto, the president argued in Tennessee Tuesday.

What Obama called a ""grand bargain"" is being proposed in a bid to break partisan gridlock currently plaguing attempts to pass major legislation in Washington, though congressional Republicans signaled on Tuesday they were unlikely to back the plan, which the president announced at an Amazon.com distribution center in Chattanooga.



""Here's the bottom line: If folks in Washington really want a 'grand bargain,' how about a grand bargain for middle-class jobs?"" Obama said in his fourth speech in a week centered on the economy. ""I don't want to go through the same old arguments, where I propose an idea and Republicans say no just because it's my idea. So I'm going to try offering something that serious people in both parties should be able to support.""

Obama suggested Congress cut corporate tax rates - long a goal of Republicans - while simultaneously making investments in job creation programs, which Democrats and the president have been championing.

In the past, both Obama and Republicans have insisted that corporate tax reform be passed alongside reform for individual earners. Republicans argue that some small business owners file taxes as individuals, and would only benefit from an overhaul of the entire tax code.

The president's plan would propose slashing the corporate tax rate to 28% from 35% while making the filing process simpler and ramping up incentives for small businesses to hire workers.

The plan would also put the tax rate on manufacturers at 25% and remove current tax incentives to send jobs overseas.

Obama also called for bolstering the country's manufacturing sector and network of community colleges, and proposed creating 45 ""innovation institutes"" that pair companies with universities and community colleges with the goal of fostering research and development.

Early reaction from Republicans to the outlines of the president's plan was not receptive.

""It is just a further left version of a widely panned plan he already proposed two years ago, this time with extra goodies for tax-and-spend liberals.""

McConnell said he first learned of the plan Monday night.

The aide argued the new White House plan was an attempt to ""get a headline that says they're offering a grand bargain.""

Obama's address in Chattanooga is the latest in a series of speeches the president will deliver on the economy and jobs, part of an attempt to turn back to the issue that rates as most important among Americans. The tour began last week in Illinois, Missouri and Florida.

Tuesday's announcement of a ""grand bargain"" was the first specific proposal the president made in his new push to focus on the economy, though White House officials say there will be more as the initiative continues.

During his remarks, Obama said he'd ""keep throwing things out there to see if something takes"" on jobs.

""If (Republicans) have better ideas to help create jobs rebuilding our infrastructure, or help workers earn the high-tech skills our businesses demand, let's hear 'em,"" the president said.

Amazon.com, whose facility Obama spoke at Tuesday, announced this week plans to hire 7,000 workers for its U.S. operation, with most jobs offering pay and benefits far above typical retail wages, the company said.

Amazon did not give specific pay scales for the positions, but said the 5,000 warehouse jobs will pay 30% more than jobs in traditional retail stores.

The jobs are full-time permanent positions and also include stock grants that, over the last five years, have averaged 9% of pay for Amazon's full-time workers. And the company said many workers would also be eligible for 95% tuition reimbursement for those attending college, whether or not their field of study is related to their job.

In addition, Amazon is looking for 2,000 workers for its customer service department, with those jobs being a mix of full-time, part-time and seasonal positions.

taxes,Vox,0,http://www.vox.com/2015/3/30/8309757/liberals-consumption-flat-tax,What liberals could learn from Ted Cruz’s flat tax,2015-03-30,"Dylan Matthews, German Lopez, Brian Resnick, Aaron Rupar","Ted Cruz has developed a reputation as the most conservative of the major 2016 Republican presidential candidates , but he has n't taken many specific policy positions to earn that moniker . One exception ? His longtime support for a flat tax .
The flat tax dramatically lowers the top tax rate and exempts capital gains and dividends from taxation . It 's astonishingly regressive : the rich pay far less , hedge fund managers and private equity types like Mitt Romney would pay literally nothing , and while the exact rate varies from plan to plan , it 's certainly not going to be as low as 10 or 15 percent , meaning the plan would likely raise taxes for middle-class people currently in those brackets .
Cruz 's flat tax proposal , as you would expect , drives liberals crazy . `` It 's a fiscal fantasy for people who wish the US existed as it did before FDR was president , '' writes Wonkblog 's Matt O'Brien . `` It 's not an agenda for anyone who 's interested in governing the country as it is today . ''
But liberals should take at least some of the ideas in the flat tax more seriously . Just as a monomaniacal obsession with growth has made conservative tax policy into a regressive disaster , an obsession with progressivity above all else is becoming an anchor on progressive tax thinking . It 's easy to come up with a flat tax–like plan that 's not crazily regressive but still benefits the economy , and the result would be substantially better than most of the tax plans Democratic politicians promote .
When thinking about tax policy , you first have to ask what you ultimately want the taxes for . Sometimes — as with alcohol or carbon taxes — the tax does good in and of itself by deterring people from bad behaviors . But mostly you want taxes to pay for worthwhile programs , and liberals in particular need a tax policy that can raise a substantial amount of money to fund a large welfare state . And the experience of most European social democracies is that to do that , you ca n't just soak the rich . You need broad-based consumption taxes , such as value-added taxes ( VATs ) , that everyone pays .
In his book Growing Public , economic historian Peter Lindert notes that high-budget welfare states in general tax investment income less and consumption more . His argument is that European social democrats realized that income taxes of the scale they 'd need to fund a comprehensive welfare state would have a deleterious effect on growth , and that the only way to sustainably pay for universal health care , generous education and pension systems , and so forth is to move toward more broad-based , pro-growth tax schemes .
The term `` flat tax '' is mostly misleading . It makes people think the flat tax is just an income tax , but with one rate instead of many . It 's not , really . Rather , it 's a kind of consumption tax — very similar to a VAT of the kind social democracies depend upon .
VATs work by taxing the difference between what a company paid on materials to make a product and what it sells that end product for : the value added , in other words . As the Tax Policy Center 's Len Burman explains , the corporate tax side of a flat tax is just a VAT that also lets companies deduct the cost of wages . Individuals then pay taxes on those wages themselves .
Economists tend to find that consumption taxes are better for the economy than income taxes , because income taxes discriminate against savers .
To see why , imagine you make $ 50,000 in wages and there 's a flat 20 percent tax on all income . You 'd pay $ 10,000 in taxes on your wages . That leaves you with $ 40,000 .
Now you 've got a decision to make : do you want to take $ 5,000 of the $ 40,000 you have left and invest it , or do you want to take that $ 5,000 and spend it on a really awesome television ? If you invest it and make money off the stocks , then the thing you bought with your money — the profits those stocks made for you — will get taxed again . If you just buy the TV , the government does n't tax you a second time .
Under standard economic models , eliminating this double-taxing of savings promotes investment and thus boosts economic growth . And it 's not just conservatives and libertarians arguing this ; a highly influential model by Anthony Atkinson and Joseph Stiglitz , both noted lefties , gives this result . A widely cited 2001 paper by David Altig , Alan Auerbach , Lawrence Kotlikoff , Kent Smetters , and Jan Walliser estimates that switching from income taxation to consumption taxation boosts growth in the long run by 1.9 to 9.4 percent , depending on how you do it .
The empirical evidence is murkier . UC Berkeley 's Danny Yagan found that the 2003 dividend tax cut — meant to reduce double taxation of savings , just like consumption taxes — did n't do anything to help the economy . But a recent paper by Tulane 's James Alm and the IMF 's Asmaa El-Ganainy found that in 15 EU countries , increases in VAT rates decreased consumption and boosted savings — exactly the result you get from the models . The matter is n't open and shut , but at the moment the weight of the evidence suggests consumption taxes are preferable for growth . That gives credence to Lindert 's argument that to raise taxes enough to fund a welfare state without hurting growth too much , you need to move to consumption taxation .
The problem with consumption taxes is that they 're usually regressive . VATs are sales taxes : they make everything more expensive by a set percentage , and because poor and middle-class people spend more of their incomes than the rich do , the end result is that the VAT hits them more than it does the rich . But there are a variety of ways to tax consumption without making the poor worse off .
The simplest way would be to do take a flat tax but make it not , y'know , flat . Recall that the main feature of the flat tax is its business component — again , it 's like a VAT that subtracts out wages . It 's totally possible to pair that with a progressive tax on wages , rather than a flat tax on wages . The result is still a consumption tax , but it 's a progressive one .
This idea — known as the X tax and originated by the late Princeton economist David Bradford — has been promoted in recent years by the American Enterprise Institute tax expert Alan Viard , who along with Robert Carroll wrote an excellent book outlining a detailed X tax proposal . The 2001 simulation by Altig et al . found that replacing the income tax with an X tax would be better for growth then even the flat tax .
The big problem with the X tax is that it does n't touch capital income . Mitt Romney would n't pay a thing . So , alternatively , you could simply amend the income tax so that all savings is tax-deductible . This would effectively turn the income tax into a consumption tax , and do it in a way that makes sure capital income still gets hit .
But the most reliable way to make a consumption tax progressive has nothing to do with the tax itself and everything to do with what the money it generates is used for . Europe 's flat VATs are not themselves progressive , the way an X tax or personal consumption tax are , but they pay for transfer payments that are larger , relative to income , for lower- and middle-class people than for the rich . The overall system is progressive even if the tax is n't .
So there 's a way to change the tax and transfer system so that it 's still progressive but does n't punish savings , and the change would likely boost economic growth . Why are n't Democratic politicians jumping all over this ?
They flirt with the idea occasionally . Then–House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D-CA ) stated that a VAT was `` on the table '' for funding health-care reform in 2009 . President Obama expressed openness to the idea in 2010 after his adviser Paul Volcker signaled support . Volcker 's comments provoked Congressional outrage , and the Senate voted 85–13 to condemn the idea as `` a massive tax increase that will cripple families on fixed income , '' but all but one of the 13 senators opposing that move were Democrats .
But years of Republicans promoting flat taxes and sales taxes have left a residual distrust for consumption taxation among liberals . More to the point , supply-siders ' insistence that marginal tax rates are the main determinant of the course of human history has done a lot to discredit , among liberals , the idea that taxes have much of an effect on growth at all .
That 's fair so far as the recent debates in American tax policy go : the idea that cutting the top tax rate from 39.6 percent to 35 percent could boost growth by any significant amount is nutty , as are claims that big tax cuts like Ted Cruz 's or Marco Rubio 's would boost growth so much they 'd pay for themselves . But the result of the backlash is that progressivity has become the only criterion by which many left-of-center people judge tax proposals , and more credible cases that tax reform could boost growth are ignored .

To quote Paul Krugman , `` if I can trade a somewhat regressive VAT for guarantees of decent retirement and universal health care , I ’ ll take it . ''

The problem with America's tax code

When thinking about tax policy, you first have to ask what you ultimately want the taxes for. Sometimes — as with alcohol or carbon taxes — the tax does good in and of itself by deterring people from bad behaviors. But mostly you want taxes to pay for worthwhile programs, and liberals in particular need a tax policy that can raise a substantial amount of money to fund a large welfare state. And the experience of most European social democracies is that to do that, you can't just soak the rich. You need broad-based consumption taxes, such as value-added taxes (VATs), that everyone pays.

Which brings us back to Ted Cruz's flat tax.

What liberals miss about flat taxes

The term ""flat tax"" is mostly misleading. It makes people think the flat tax is just an income tax, but with one rate instead of many. It's not, really. Rather, it's a kind of consumption tax — very similar to a VAT of the kind social democracies depend upon.

VATs work by taxing the difference between what a company paid on materials to make a product and what it sells that end product for: the value added, in other words. As the Tax Policy Center's Len Burman explains, the corporate tax side of a flat tax is just a VAT that also lets companies deduct the cost of wages. Individuals then pay taxes on those wages themselves.

That gives credence to Lindert's argument that to raise taxes enough to fund a welfare state without hurting growth too much, you need to move to consumption taxation.

Taxing consumption can be progressive

The problem with consumption taxes is that they're usually regressive. VATs are sales taxes: they make everything more expensive by a set percentage, and because poor and middle-class people spend more of their incomes than the rich do, the end result is that the VAT hits them more than it does the rich. But there are a variety of ways to tax consumption without making the poor worse off.

Recall that the main feature of the flat tax is its business component — again, it's like a VAT that subtracts out wages. It's totally possible to pair that with a progressive tax on wages, rather than a flat tax on wages. The result is still a consumption tax, but it's a progressive one.

This idea — known as the X tax and originated by the late Princeton economist David Bradford — has been promoted in recent years by the American Enterprise Institute tax expert Alan Viard, who along with Robert Carroll wrote an excellent book outlining a detailed X tax proposal. The 2001 simulation by Altig et al. found that replacing the income tax with an X tax would be better for growth then even the flat tax.

The big problem with the X tax is that it doesn't touch capital income. Mitt Romney wouldn't pay a thing. So, alternatively, you could simply amend the income tax so that all savings is tax-deductible.

The overall system is progressive even if the tax isn't.

What will be liberals' flat tax?

So there's a way to change the tax and transfer system so that it's still progressive but doesn't punish savings, and the change would likely boost economic growth. Why aren't Democratic politicians jumping all over this?

They flirt with the idea occasionally. Then–House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) stated that a VAT was ""on the table"" for funding health-care reform in 2009.

taxes,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/aug/30/donald-trump-outlines-tax-cut-plan-pressures-congr/,"Trump’s ‘American model’ for tax cuts encourages Republicans, unites Democrats in opposition",2017-08-30,Dave Boyer,"After a rough summer of divisions within his own party in Congress , President Trump began his long-awaited push for tax cuts Wednesday , a move likely to unify Republicans and raise pressure on Democrats in conservative states for some rare cooperation .
Traveling to Missouri , the home state of Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill , the president offered broad outlines of his unfinished plan for tax reform , calling it “ the foundation ” for better jobs and prosperity . He urged voters to punish lawmakers who don ’ t cooperate with him this fall .
“ I want to work with Congress , Republicans and Democrats alike , on a plan that is pro-growth , pro-jobs , pro-worker and pro-American , ” Mr. Trump told employees at a factory in Springfield . “ Your senator , Claire McCaskill , she must do this for you . If she doesn ’ t do it for you , you have to vote her out of office . ”
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House chief economic adviser Gary Cohn have yet to hash out details of a tax reform plan with congressional Republican leaders , but the president said it should include tax relief for middle-class families , simplification of tax forms , elimination of “ special interest loopholes ” and a cut in the business tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent .
“ My administration is embracing a new economic model . It ’ s called , very simply , the American model , ” Mr. Trump said . “ Under this system , we will encourage companies to hire and grow in America , to raise wages for American workers , and to help rebuild our American cities and communities . ”
The reaction from Republicans was swift and positive , after a summer of increasing rancor in which Mr. Trump engaged in public feuds with Republican lawmakers on issues such as the Senate ’ s failure to repeal Obamacare and a move by Congress to stiffen sanctions against Russia .
House Speaker Paul D. Ryan , Wisconsin Republican , said tax cuts and tax reform are the “ top priority ” this fall .
“ We are united in our determination to get this done , ” he said .
Sen. Dean Heller , a Nevada Republican who has clashed with Mr. Trump , said Congress is ready for tax reform and that the president ’ s speech was encouraging .
“ I ’ m looking forward to working with the administration on this issue and having a seat at the table to make sure that the final product is what ’ s best for Nevada , ” said Mr. Heller , a member of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee .
The response from Democratic lawmakers ranged from skepticism to hostility .
“ The president has repeatedly talked a good game when it comes to the working class , ” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York said in a conference call with liberal activists . “ But just about everything he ’ s done has been to benefit the wealthy special interests , adding to the burden of those in the middle class . We Democrats will not go along with a tax plan that includes a tax cut for the folks who need it least . ”
Rep. Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts , the ranking Democrat on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee , said Democrats stand ready to work with Republicans on tax reform , but he accused Mr. Trump of plotting relief mainly for the wealthy .
“ If President Trump ’ s previous tax plans are any indication , the wealthy and big corporations will be the ultimate winner at the expense of the middle class , ” Mr. Neal said . “ Middle-class families have heard enough empty promises and rhetoric from Republicans . ”
One potential exception on the Democratic side is Ms. McCaskill , the two-term senator who represents a state that Mr. Trump won by 18.5 percentage points over Hillary Clinton in the presidential contest in November .
Ms. McCaskill faces re-election next year , and she said prior to Mr. Trump ’ s visit that she is eager to work with him on tax relief “ as long as we ’ re doing it all through the lens of strengthening Missouri ’ s working families . ”
“ This is an area on which I ’ m optimistic President Trump and I will find common ground , ” she said in a statement last weekend . “ I welcome President Trump to Missouri , and I ’ m looking forward to working with him to make bipartisan tax reform a reality . ”
Mr. Trump said Democrats are blocking his agenda , and he singled out Ms. McCaskill as one of the guilty parties .
“ She ’ s going to make that commitment , ” he said of tax cuts . “ We just can ’ t do this anymore with the obstruction and the obstructionists . The Dems are looking to obstruct tax cuts and tax reform . ”
After failing to get a bill through the Senate last month to repeal and replace Obamacare , Mr. Trump said the spotlight is on Congress to succeed on tax reform .
“ I don ’ t want to be disappointed by Congress , do you understand me ? ” Mr. Trump said . “ I think Congress is going to make a comeback . I hope so . The United States is counting on it . ”
Getting a major tax overhaul through Congress is difficult in any given year — the last time was 1986 under President Reagan — and it looks increasingly difficult this year .
Mr. Mnuchin ’ s initial deadline of August already has passed without a bill , and lawmakers are confronting a September in which they must approve a federal budget for fiscal 2018 and address the administration ’ s request to raise the debt ceiling .
Hanging over those deadlines are challenges such as Mr. Trump ’ s insistence on funding for a border wall , an expense that Democrats consider a nonstarter .
Still , with Republicans holding majorities in the Senate and the House , plus the White House , advocates of tax reform say Congress has a rare opportunity to achieve a pro-growth fix that also simplifies the tax code . Deficit hawks are urging the administration and lawmakers to craft a solution that doesn ’ t simply cut taxes and add to the nation ’ s $ 20 trillion debt .
“ President Trump and Congress have a rare opportunity to reform our outdated tax code in a way that grows the economy , not the national debt , ” said Michael Peterson , president and CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation . “ As we move toward more detailed proposals , lawmakers should work across party lines to craft durable , comprehensive tax reform that is both pro-growth and fiscally responsible . ”
In recent negotiations , administration officials and congressional leaders have considered scaling back some of the president ’ s more ambitious proposals , such as reducing the corporate tax rate to 20 or 25 percent and keeping the top individual tax rate at 39.6 percent instead of lowering it .
While there was no clarity on those points Wednesday , comments from the president and his top advisers emphasized tax-relief for the middle class .
“ Americans understand that middle-income taxpayers and their families need tax relief and a simple tax code so they keep more of their paycheck and spend less time filling out their taxes , ” Mr. Mnuchin said .
Bolstering the president ’ s pitch for tax reform Wednesday was more good economic news : The Commerce Department revised the second-quarter gross domestic product up to 3 percent , from 2.7 percent , the highest level of economic growth in two years .
Mr. Trump has been promising a target of at least 3 percent growth annually , and he seized on the news as an indication of even better things to come .
“ In the last 10 years , our economy has grown at only around 2 percent a year , ” the president said . “ We ’ re going to change that around , folks . The last administration , on an annual basis , never hit 3 percent . So we ’ re really on our way . This is our once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver real tax reform for everyday hardworking Americans . ”
Sen. David Perdue , Georgia Republican and a member of the Senate Budget Committee , said the clock is ticking .
“ There are only 61 session days until the end of the year to pass a plan that eliminates the repatriation tax , lowers the corporate tax rate , and simplifies the individual tax system to bring relief to working men and women , ” Mr. Perdue said . “ Consumer confidence is at a 16-year high , and many businesses are investing and creating more jobs than ever before . We are on the cusp of an economic turnaround , and these tax changes must happen this year in order to have any real impact on business decisions that can produce significant economic growth . ”","After a rough summer of divisions within his own party in Congress, President Trump began his long-awaited push for tax cuts Wednesday, a move likely to unify Republicans and raise pressure on Democrats in conservative states for some rare cooperation.

Traveling to Missouri, the home state of Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill, the president offered broad outlines of his unfinished plan for tax reform, calling it “the foundation” for better jobs and prosperity. He urged voters to punish lawmakers who don’t cooperate with him this fall.

“I want to work with Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, on a plan that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker and pro-American,” Mr. Trump told employees at a factory in Springfield. “Your senator, Claire McCaskill, she must do this for you. If she doesn’t do it for you, you have to vote her out of office.”

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House chief economic adviser Gary Cohn have yet to hash out details of a tax reform plan with congressional Republican leaders, but the president said it should include tax relief for middle-class families, simplification of tax forms, elimination of “special interest loopholes” and a cut in the business tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent.

“My administration is embracing a new economic model. It’s called, very simply, the American model,” Mr. Trump said. “Under this system, we will encourage companies to hire and grow in America, to raise wages for American workers, and to help rebuild our American cities and communities.”

The reaction from Republicans was swift and positive, after a summer of increasing rancor in which Mr. Trump engaged in public feuds with Republican lawmakers on issues such as the Senate’s failure to repeal Obamacare and a move by Congress to stiffen sanctions against Russia.

House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, said tax cuts and tax reform are the “top priority” this fall.

“We are united in our determination to get this done,” he said.

Sen. Dean Heller, a Nevada Republican who has clashed with Mr. Trump, said Congress is ready for tax reform and that the president’s speech was encouraging.

“I’m looking forward to working with the administration on this issue and having a seat at the table to make sure that the final product is what’s best for Nevada,” said Mr. Heller, a member of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee.

The response from Democratic lawmakers ranged from skepticism to hostility.

“The president has repeatedly talked a good game when it comes to the working class,” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York said in a conference call with liberal activists. “But just about everything he’s done has been to benefit the wealthy special interests, adding to the burden of those in the middle class. We Democrats will not go along with a tax plan that includes a tax cut for the folks who need it least.”

Rep. Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said Democrats stand ready to work with Republicans on tax reform, but he accused Mr. Trump of plotting relief mainly for the wealthy.

“If President Trump’s previous tax plans are any indication, the wealthy and big corporations will be the ultimate winner at the expense of the middle class,” Mr. Neal said. “Middle-class families have heard enough empty promises and rhetoric from Republicans.”

‘A rare opportunity’

One potential exception on the Democratic side is Ms. McCaskill, the two-term senator who represents a state that Mr. Trump won by 18.5 percentage points over Hillary Clinton in the presidential contest in November.

Ms. McCaskill faces re-election next year, and she said prior to Mr. Trump’s visit that she is eager to work with him on tax relief “as long as we’re doing it all through the lens of strengthening Missouri’s working families.”

“This is an area on which I’m optimistic President Trump and I will find common ground,” she said in a statement last weekend. “I welcome President Trump to Missouri, and I’m looking forward to working with him to make bipartisan tax reform a reality.”

Mr. Trump said Democrats are blocking his agenda, and he singled out Ms. McCaskill as one of the guilty parties.

“She’s going to make that commitment,” he said of tax cuts. “We just can’t do this anymore with the obstruction and the obstructionists. The Dems are looking to obstruct tax cuts and tax reform.”

After failing to get a bill through the Senate last month to repeal and replace Obamacare, Mr. Trump said the spotlight is on Congress to succeed on tax reform.

“I don’t want to be disappointed by Congress, do you understand me?” Mr. Trump said. “I think Congress is going to make a comeback. I hope so. The United States is counting on it.”

Getting a major tax overhaul through Congress is difficult in any given year — the last time was 1986 under President Reagan — and it looks increasingly difficult this year.

Mr. Mnuchin’s initial deadline of August already has passed without a bill, and lawmakers are confronting a September in which they must approve a federal budget for fiscal 2018 and address the administration’s request to raise the debt ceiling.

Hanging over those deadlines are challenges such as Mr. Trump’s insistence on funding for a border wall, an expense that Democrats consider a nonstarter.

Still, with Republicans holding majorities in the Senate and the House, plus the White House, advocates of tax reform say Congress has a rare opportunity to achieve a pro-growth fix that also simplifies the tax code. Deficit hawks are urging the administration and lawmakers to craft a solution that doesn’t simply cut taxes and add to the nation’s $20 trillion debt.

“President Trump and Congress have a rare opportunity to reform our outdated tax code in a way that grows the economy, not the national debt,” said Michael Peterson, president and CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation. “As we move toward more detailed proposals, lawmakers should work across party lines to craft durable, comprehensive tax reform that is both pro-growth and fiscally responsible.”

Middle-class tax relief

In recent negotiations, administration officials and congressional leaders have considered scaling back some of the president’s more ambitious proposals, such as reducing the corporate tax rate to 20 or 25 percent and keeping the top individual tax rate at 39.6 percent instead of lowering it.

While there was no clarity on those points Wednesday, comments from the president and his top advisers emphasized tax-relief for the middle class.

“Americans understand that middle-income taxpayers and their families need tax relief and a simple tax code so they keep more of their paycheck and spend less time filling out their taxes,” Mr. Mnuchin said.

Bolstering the president’s pitch for tax reform Wednesday was more good economic news: The Commerce Department revised the second-quarter gross domestic product up to 3 percent, from 2.7 percent, the highest level of economic growth in two years.

Mr. Trump has been promising a target of at least 3 percent growth annually, and he seized on the news as an indication of even better things to come.

“In the last 10 years, our economy has grown at only around 2 percent a year,” the president said. “We’re going to change that around, folks. The last administration, on an annual basis, never hit 3 percent. So we’re really on our way. This is our once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver real tax reform for everyday hardworking Americans.”

Sen. David Perdue, Georgia Republican and a member of the Senate Budget Committee, said the clock is ticking.

“There are only 61 session days until the end of the year to pass a plan that eliminates the repatriation tax, lowers the corporate tax rate, and simplifies the individual tax system to bring relief to working men and women,” Mr. Perdue said. “Consumer confidence is at a 16-year high, and many businesses are investing and creating more jobs than ever before. We are on the cusp of an economic turnaround, and these tax changes must happen this year in order to have any real impact on business decisions that can produce significant economic growth.”

WASHINGTON — For the average taxpayer , the odds of being audited by the Internal Revenue Service are just 0.7 % .
Unless you 're President Trump , in which case your chance of an audit rises to 100 % .
It 's not just that his net worth and more than 500 partnerships make him a likely audit target under IRS policies designed to direct its enforcement efforts to the richest taxpayers . Under an obscure Internal Revenue Service rule , the tax returns of the president and vice president are automatically audited , every year , no exceptions .

Why ? Trump says he wo n't release his tax returns while they 're under audit . `` I will absolutely give my returns , but I ’ m being audited now for two or three years , so I can ’ t do it until the audit is finished , obviously , '' Trump said at a Republican primary debate last year .

But if Trump continues to use the audits as a reason to avoid releasing his returns , he can use that rationale for the remainder of his presidency .
The IRS rules mean that Trump will not be the first president to have his returns under audit . The agency treats presidential and vice-presidential returns similarly to those of IRS employees , who also receive a mandatory audit . The procedures are spelled out in detail in Internal Revenue Manual Section 4.2.1.11 :
► The tax returns must be given a full audit — not just a pre-audit survey — regardless of whether a computer program known as the Discriminant Inventory Function identifies the return as raising red flags .
► The audit is fast-tracked . `` The returns must be assigned within 10 business days of receipt in the group . The returns require expeditious handling at all levels to ensure prompt completion of the examinations . ''
► The returns must be carefully guarded , and locked away when not being actively examined .
► `` The returns should be kept in an orange folder at all times . '' Under the IRS color scheme , orange folders get the third-highest priority , and are reserved for mandatory audits of the president , vice president , and IRS employees .

Why presidential tax returns are given the orange-folder treatment.

WASHINGTON — For the average taxpayer, the odds of being audited by the Internal Revenue Service are just 0.7%.

Unless you're President Trump, in which case your chance of an audit rises to 100%.

It's not just that his net worth and more than 500 partnerships make him a likely audit target under IRS policies designed to direct its enforcement efforts to the richest taxpayers. Under an obscure Internal Revenue Service rule, the tax returns of the president and vice president are automatically audited, every year, no exceptions.

That rule has been in place in one form or another since the Nixon administration, and it details the process for auditing presidential tax returns in minute detail — even down the color of folder they must be kept in.

Presidential tax returns have been subjected to that process for more than 40 years, but it's taken on new significance this year. It's indisputable that Trump's tax returns will be the most complicated of any president in history, and he's the first president since Gerald Ford to refuse to publicly release copies of those returns.

Why? Trump says he won't release his tax returns while they're under audit. ""I will absolutely give my returns, but I’m being audited now for two or three years, so I can’t do it until the audit is finished, obviously,"" Trump said at a Republican primary debate last year.

And that's where some Democrats think they've found an opening. ""At the very least, even if he continues to hide behind the phony excuse of being under audit, he should release tax returns for 2016 as those are not under audit,"" said Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., during a debate in the House of Representatives last month.

But if Trump continues to use the audits as a reason to avoid releasing his returns, he can use that rationale for the remainder of his presidency.

The IRS rules mean that Trump will not be the first president to have his returns under audit. The agency treats presidential and vice-presidential returns similarly to those of IRS employees, who also receive a mandatory audit. The procedures are spelled out in detail in Internal Revenue Manual Section 4.2.1.11:

► The tax returns must be given a full audit — not just a pre-audit survey — regardless of whether a computer program known as the Discriminant Inventory Function identifies the return as raising red flags.

► The audit is fast-tracked. ""The returns must be assigned within 10 business days of receipt in the group. The returns require expeditious handling at all levels to ensure prompt completion of the examinations.""

► The returns must be carefully guarded, and locked away when not being actively examined.

► ""The returns should be kept in an orange folder at all times."" Under the IRS color scheme, orange folders get the third-highest priority, and are reserved for mandatory audits of the president, vice president, and IRS employees.

The process begins when the returns arrive in the office of the deputy commissioner for services and enforcement, the top career — that is, not politically appointed — official at the IRS.

One former deputy commissioner, Mark Matthews, said the process was so routine that it barely even came to his attention. “It definitely goes through the deputy commissioner’s office, and I know there was a safe in the back of my office where they kept the original returns,” he said.

Matthews said IRS agents are “scrupulously nonpartisan” and would treat the president’s returns without regard to political agendas. “It is drilled into IRS agents to treat similarly situated taxpayers similarly. ‘It’s not who you are, it’s what your taxes are,’” he said.

As of 1997, every presidential tax return ever filed amounted to a stack of paper about 5 feet deep.

With Trump, they may need to find more room.

In a tweet last year, Trump posted a photo of him signing what he said was a recent tax return, with paper stacked more than three feet high. ""Isn't this ridiculous?"" he wrote.

“ It could be billions , ” said David Herzig , a tax law professor at Valparaiso University . “ People are saying , ‘ Oh well , don ’ t worry , ’ but you could be looking at the potential of billions of dollars in tax liability . ”
Trump — who , with his army of lawyers , is examining his options ahead of a mid-December promised rollout of a plan to clarify the blurred lines between his business and political interests — could put off paying part of those taxes by taking advantage of a law permitting a tax-free trade to comply with federal conflict-of-interest rules , but there are legal questions about whether Trump is eligible for it .
To take advantage of the provision , he might have to sign an executive order qualifying himself — an action that would surely generate a barrage of criticism that he was giving himself a big tax break .
“ I don ’ t think anyone had really thought through how you go from running an active real estate business to being president , without having any income , estate and gift tax problems , ” Herzig said . “ They say , ‘ We ’ ll work it out , ’ but saying you ’ ll work it out and figuring out how you ’ ll work it out are two different things . … This is a huge problem to try to solve in just two or three weeks . ”
The temporary waiver of capital gains taxes to comply with ethics rules was put into law in 1989 with the goal of limiting the tax impact on incoming government officials who sell assets in order to assume federal posts .
Several prominent ethics experts pushing Trump to actually divest himself of his company say he should qualify for the tax certificate , typically issued by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics , but they acknowledge some legal uncertainty .
“ No president ever asked for one . We don ’ t know whether a president can get one , ” said C. Boyden Gray , White House counsel under President George H.W . Bush . “ It ’ s never happened before because no one has ever asked for it before . ”
One potential problem is that the law authorizing such tax-free sales says the certificates should be issued only when “ reasonably necessary to comply with any Federal conflict of interest statute , regulation , rule , judicial canon , or executive order … or requested by a congressional committee as a condition of confirmation . ”
Since the main federal conflict-of-interest law doesn ’ t apply to the president , it ’ s unclear how the ethics office would justify issuing a certificate to Trump .
“ There ’ s a possible legal objection because the same law which exempts him and VP from criminal penalties is also the same law used to describe who qualifies , ” Gray said . “ I do believe the president would qualify if he were to divest , would qualify for tax treatment allowing him to postpone the tax . ”
Trump could put himself within the sweep of the statute by issuing an executive order requiring him to divest , but critics could frame that as an unsavory form of slashing his own tax bill .
Even if Trump could get a certificate allowing him to sell his company without immediately paying capital gains tax , there are other wrinkles that could cause problems .
Such certificates don ’ t cover gift taxes , so giving the company or any other assets to his children or selling to them at less than market value would still leave him with a hefty gift tax bill — up to 40 percent of the value over about $ 11 million . ( Trump has proposed eliminating this tax altogether , but the prospects for such legislation are uncertain . )
Gray has proposed that Trump sell the company to his children , perhaps with outside financing or a buyout , assuming they don ’ t have enough money on hand to buy the firm . But if outsiders give such loans , they ’ ll be scrutinized for signs of favor-seeking . And if Trump were to finance the sale himself , his former business would presumably be the collateral , an arrangement that would seem to produce the same conflicts of interest that it would be trying to solve .
Former Obama White House ethics lawyer Norm Eisen says he ’ d support issuing the tax waiver to Trump in order to solve the conflicts but would like to see more of a traditional blind trust , with a trustee authorized to conduct an orderly sale of Trump ’ s business interests — perhaps through a public stock offering .
The Trump children could stay involved with the company if they are “ firewalled ” from government business , but trying to sell the company to the Trump kids would risk a “ tax calamity , ” Eisen said . “ Even if you got the certificate , there ’ s a question of whether the IRS would honor it with a novel arrangement . … When you ’ re looking at a $ 500 million potential tax bill , maybe that ’ s not the place you want to be . ”
Experts say the precise tax impact of a sale on Trump is impossible to know without a more detailed picture of his holdings and his current tax bills . Federal financial disclosure forms indicate he has a net worth of over $ 1.4 billion . He has claimed to be worth $ 10 billion , while Forbes has estimated his net worth at $ 4 billion .
Unlike all major presidential candidates in recent decades , Trump refused to release his tax returns during the campaign.The law does not require such disclosure .
One example of the hard-to-assess effects is that the special dispensation for resolving conflicts of interest also doesn ’ t apply to ordinary income , something that could further complicate the sale because selling certain kinds of assets that have been largely written off in past years can produce big income tax bills not covered by the law addressing conflicts of interest .
Trump ’ s plans to retreat from his businesses have engendered both criticism and confusion in recent days , but it appears he ’ s not actively considering the sale of his core businesses , even to his children .
In an interview late last month , Trump was asked why he didn ’ t simply sell his company .
“ That ’ s a very hard thing to do , you know what , because I have real estate . I have real estate all over the world , ” Trump told The New York Times . “ Selling real estate isn ’ t like selling stock . Selling real estate is much different . It ’ s in a much different world . ”
On Wednesday , he tweeted out a series of messages that seemed intended to quiet complaints about his business holdings complicating the incoming administration ’ s work , particularly overseas .
“ I will be leaving my great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country in order to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN ! ” Trump wrote , saying he ’ d have a press conference on Dec. 15 to explain the details .
“ Legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations . The Presidency is a far more important task ! ”
Officials at the Office of Government Ethics responded effusively , hailing Trump for pledging to put his assets into a blind trust .
“ OGE applauds the ‘ total ’ divestiture decision . Bravo ! ” the agency wrote on its Twitter account . “ OGE is delighted that you 've decided to divest your businesses . … This divestiture does what handing over control could never have done . ”
However , Trump ’ s Twitter statements never said he was ceding ownership of his businesses . OGE said in a subsequent statement that it had no information beyond what Trump posted on social media .
After the election last month , the Trump Organization issued a statement that seemed to indicate the president-elect planned to hand over control of his company — but not ownership — to his children .
“ We are in the process of vetting various structures with the goal of the immediate transfer of management of The Trump Organization and its portfolio of businesses to Donald Jr. , Ivanka and Eric Trump along with a team of highly skilled executives , ” a Trump Organization spokeswoman said .
Yet , even the step-back arrangement Trump seems to be favoring could have tax consequences for him . He ’ s likely been treated as an active investor for tax purposes in recent decades because he ’ s personally involved in managing his real estate portfolio . If he retreats completely from his businesses , he becomes a passive investor . Experts say the change would affect Trump ’ s tax bill , but it ’ s unclear how significantly .
Some experts say that whatever tax bill Trump would face for selling off his company , he should simply accept it as a cost of assuming his weighty new duties in the Oval Office .
“ There could be sticker shock , ” said Dan Shaviro , a professor of tax law at New York University . “ But most people would say , 'You just became president , if you ’ re transitioning to thinking about being a public servant as president , that ’ s just trivial . ' ”","President-elect Donald Trump’s unwillingness to give up his far-flung real estate empire by selling it off or giving it outright to his children may be driven by a factor he has yet to mention publicly: a potentially staggering tax bill triggered by such a transaction.

Former Obama White House ethics lawyer Norm Eisen says he’d support issuing the tax waiver to Trump in order to solve the conflicts but would like to see more of a traditional blind trust, with a trustee authorized to conduct an orderly sale of Trump’s business interests — perhaps through a public stock offering.

The Trump children could stay involved with the company if they are “firewalled” from government business, but trying to sell the company to the Trump kids would risk a “tax calamity,” Eisen said. “Even if you got the certificate, there’s a question of whether the IRS would honor it with a novel arrangement. … When you’re looking at a $500 million potential tax bill, maybe that’s not the place you want to be.”

Experts say the precise tax impact of a sale on Trump is impossible to know without a more detailed picture of his holdings and his current tax bills. Federal financial disclosure forms indicate he has a net worth of over $1.4 billion. He has claimed to be worth $10 billion, while Forbes has estimated his net worth at $4 billion.

Unlike all major presidential candidates in recent decades, Trump refused to release his tax returns during the campaign.The law does not require such disclosure.

One example of the hard-to-assess effects is that the special dispensation for resolving conflicts of interest also doesn’t apply to ordinary income, something that could further complicate the sale because selling certain kinds of assets that have been largely written off in past years can produce big income tax bills not covered by the law addressing conflicts of interest.

Trump’s plans to retreat from his businesses have engendered both criticism and confusion in recent days, but it appears he’s not actively considering the sale of his core businesses, even to his children.

In an interview late last month, Trump was asked why he didn’t simply sell his company.

“That’s a very hard thing to do, you know what, because I have real estate. I have real estate all over the world,” Trump told The New York Times. “Selling real estate isn’t like selling stock. Selling real estate is much different. It’s in a much different world.”

On Wednesday, he tweeted out a series of messages that seemed intended to quiet complaints about his business holdings complicating the incoming administration’s work, particularly overseas.

“I will be leaving my great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country in order to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Trump wrote, saying he’d have a press conference on Dec. 15 to explain the details.

“Legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations. The Presidency is a far more important task!”

Officials at the Office of Government Ethics responded effusively, hailing Trump for pledging to put his assets into a blind trust.

“OGE applauds the ‘total’ divestiture decision. Bravo!” the agency wrote on its Twitter account. “OGE is delighted that you've decided to divest your businesses. … This divestiture does what handing over control could never have done.”

However, Trump’s Twitter statements never said he was ceding ownership of his businesses. OGE said in a subsequent statement that it had no information beyond what Trump posted on social media.

After the election last month, the Trump Organization issued a statement that seemed to indicate the president-elect planned to hand over control of his company — but not ownership — to his children.

“We are in the process of vetting various structures with the goal of the immediate transfer of management of The Trump Organization and its portfolio of businesses to Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric Trump along with a team of highly skilled executives,” a Trump Organization spokeswoman said.

Yet, even the step-back arrangement Trump seems to be favoring could have tax consequences for him. He’s likely been treated as an active investor for tax purposes in recent decades because he’s personally involved in managing his real estate portfolio. If he retreats completely from his businesses, he becomes a passive investor. Experts say the change would affect Trump’s tax bill, but it’s unclear how significantly.

Some experts say that whatever tax bill Trump would face for selling off his company, he should simply accept it as a cost of assuming his weighty new duties in the Oval Office.

“There could be sticker shock,” said Dan Shaviro, a professor of tax law at New York University. “But most people would say, 'You just became president, if you’re transitioning to thinking about being a public servant as president, that’s just trivial.'”",www.politico.com,left,jchZnZYtc9LtXnT0

The Affordable Care Act requires those who didn ’ t have insurance last year and didn ’ t qualify for one of the exemptions to pay a tax penalty , which was widely cited as $ 95 the first year . But the $ 95 is actually a minimum , and middle- and upper-income families will actually end up paying 1 percent of their household income as their penalty .
TurboTax , an online tax service , estimated that the average penalty for lacking health insurance in 2014 will be $ 301 .
“ People would hear the $ 95 , quit listening , and make an assumption that that was what their penalty was going to be , ” said Chuck Lovelace , vice president of affordable care for Liberty Tax Service . “ I think that a lot of people will be surprised when they get in there and find out that their penalty is [ based ] on their household income . ”
The penalty is designed to prod Americans to buy insurance and the penalty for not having it is scheduled to rise considerably : to a $ 325 minimum or 2 percent of income in 2015 , and to a $ 695 minimum or 2.5 percent of income in 2016 .
Tax experts said those stung by a higher penalty the first year may buy plans to escape the penalty the next go-around .
“ We will be showing them what the penalty is , ” said Jackie Perlman , principal tax research analyst at The Tax Institute at H & R Block , said of this year ’ s customers . “ But we will also be telling them , ‘ How do we not go down this road next year ? ’ ”
The tax industry and government officials have been trying to prepare filers for the changes since the Affordable Care Act was signed in 2010 , but tax preparers still expect to get strange looks when they inquire about their customers ’ health insurance .
“ You might think it ’ s a question that a tax preparer shouldn ’ t be asking , but we have to ask that , ” Ms. Perlman said .
Tax experts said mixing Obamacare with the annual tax filing season is a major adjustment , and it comes even as the IRS , blaming budget cuts , says it won ’ t be able to even answer a majority of help calls , and those who do get through will have to wait an average of 30 minutes .
Gearing up for the challenge , Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell spoke to more than 100 volunteer tax preparers Friday .
Most taxpayers will only have to check a box asserting they had their own insurance , usually through their employer . But those who bought insurance on the Obamacare exchanges with the help of federal subsidies will have to reconcile their payments with their income level .
Some people will get money back , although those who failed to report raises or bonuses to their respective health exchanges will pay back some amount of subsidy .
HealthCare.gov , the federal exchange that serves 37 states , started to mail out 1095-A forms to customers last week , and state-run exchanges say they will meet the end-of-month deadline to postmark theirs .
But the subsidies were paid directly to insurers , and not the Obamacare customer , so filers might not remember them or realize they need the form .
It ’ s a short wait for the 1095-A — about two weeks — but tax experts fear some taxpayers , looking to get a jump on the process and with a W-2 already in hand from their employers , will file without waiting for the Obamacare form , causing problems and delaying their refund .

taxes,New York Times - News,0,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/13/us/politics/republican-tax-overhaul-timeline-september.html,Trump Goes All In on a Tax Overhaul Whose Details Remain Unwritten,2017-09-13,Alan Rappeport,"“ I took that as a signal that he ’ s not concerned about the upper 1 percent or 5 percent , he ’ s concerned about hopefully middle-class Americans , ” he said . “ Proof ’ s in the pudding . We ’ ll see how it comes out . ”
That gathering was one of a series of bipartisan efforts to push the tax overhaul . He held a dinner Tuesday night with senators from both parties where tax matters dominated the conversation . On Wednesday night , the president was set to dine with Congress ’ s top Democrats , Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California .
To old hands of America ’ s biggest tax policy battles , the Republicans ’ accelerated timeline appears virtually impossible . One big reason : the diminished standing of Gary D. Cohn , director of the president ’ s National Economic Council , and Steven Mnuchin , his Treasury secretary . That diminution is largely of the team ’ s own making ; Mr. Trump has let it be known that Mr. Cohn is in disfavor for publicly disparaging the president ’ s response to violent racists in Charlottesville , Va. , and Mr. Mnuchin suffered public scorn after jetting to Kentucky on a government plane with his wife to witness the solar eclipse .
Their stature stands in contrast to the experienced players who shepherded the last major tax overhaul in 1986 .
“ Things are quite anarchic across the board right now , and that ’ s not helping at all , ” said C. Eugene Steuerle , who served as the coordinator of the Treasury Department ’ s tax reform effort from 1984 to 1986 .
Last week , Mr. Trump blindsided Mr. Mnuchin during negotiations over lifting the government ’ s statutory borrowing limit — an issue that is central to the job of Treasury secretary . Mr. Mnuchin was pushing for an 18-month extension of the debt limit before Mr. Trump interrupted him and sided with Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi , who wanted a three-month extension .
The White House press secretary , Sarah Huckabee Sanders , insisted this week that Mr. Trump had “ confidence ” in Mr. Mnuchin , but the rift over the debt limit left many observers wondering if his public stances on taxes could still be trusted .","“I took that as a signal that he’s not concerned about the upper 1 percent or 5 percent, he’s concerned about hopefully middle-class Americans,” he said. “Proof’s in the pudding. We’ll see how it comes out.”

On Wednesday night, the president was set to dine with Congress’s top Democrats, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California.

To old hands of America’s biggest tax policy battles, the Republicans’ accelerated timeline appears virtually impossible. One big reason: the diminished standing of Gary D. Cohn, director of the president’s National Economic Council, and Steven Mnuchin, his Treasury secretary. That diminution is largely of the team’s own making; Mr. Trump has let it be known that Mr. Cohn is in disfavor for publicly disparaging the president’s response to violent racists in Charlottesville, Va., and Mr. Mnuchin suffered public scorn after jetting to Kentucky on a government plane with his wife to witness the solar eclipse.

Their stature stands in contrast to the experienced players who shepherded the last major tax overhaul in 1986.

“Things are quite anarchic across the board right now, and that’s not helping at all,” said C. Eugene Steuerle, who served as the coordinator of the Treasury Department’s tax reform effort from 1984 to 1986.

Last week, Mr. Trump blindsided Mr. Mnuchin during negotiations over lifting the government’s statutory borrowing limit — an issue that is central to the job of Treasury secretary. Mr. Mnuchin was pushing for an 18-month extension of the debt limit before Mr. Trump interrupted him and sided with Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi, who wanted a three-month extension.

The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, insisted this week that Mr. Trump had “confidence” in Mr. Mnuchin, but the rift over the debt limit left many observers wondering if his public stances on taxes could still be trusted.",www.nytimes.com,left,F2ADIc0LMNXrSBSK

The Budget Control Act of 2011 requires the president and Congress to come up with a nine-year, $1.2 trillion deficit-reduction plan by Jan. 1, or annual defense and non-entitlement programs will be cut automatically by $109 billion.

Simultaneously, the George W. Bush tax cuts — a 2 percentage-point payroll-tax reduction, extended unemployment benefits and other assorted programs — will expire. Without new legislation, taxes will be increased and spending cut by more than $600 billion. A sudden and massive drop in private and government spending surely would tank the economy and send the unemployment rate into the teens.

All confidence would be lost in Washington’s ability to manage its finances, bondholders would abandon U.S. Treasury-issued bonds, the Federal Reserve would be compelled to print money to finance the government and avert default, and U.S. businesses would flee to more promising and better-managed venues in Asia.

A second Great Depression would grip the nation.

To avert calamity, President Obama and House Republicans likely will compromise to raise taxes on high-income Americans by $100 billion to $150 billion, curb spending an equal amount and renew the Bush tax cuts for families earning less than $250,000.

This will hardly be enough to right the nation’s shaky finances, yet slicing the budget deficit by as little as $200 billion or $300 billion still would throw the economy, barely growing at 2 percent, into a tailspin.

Simply put, Americans and their economy have become addicted to huge federal deficits.

During Mr. Bush’s first four years, the trade deficit doubled and ultimately pierced $800 billion, owing to lost competitiveness with China and rising oil prices. A recession should have resulted from this lost demand for U.S.-made goods and services.

Instead, Beijing and oil exporters stepped up purchases of mortgage-backed bonds and other U.S. securities. Aided by creative lending by our nation’s banks, Americans spent more than they earned and sustained the boom into 2007. When borrowers ultimately defaulted, the bubble burst, and the nation was thrust into financial chaos.

A huge trade gap continues, but the federal government is doing the borrowing and spending to keep the economy going.

The annual budget gap has averaged $1.3 trillion over the past four years — up from $161 billion in 2007, the year before the financial collapse. Spending is up $1 trillion — outlays for Social Security, Medicare and other entitlements have increased by more than both the entire 2013 budget for the Department of Defense and appropriations for other civilian outlays.

By 2020, runaway entitlement spending will require completely shutting down the military or crippling domestic spending programs and imposing massive new taxes on the middle class.

With Americans living longer, the solution is to raise the Social Security retirement age to 70 and pattern U.S. health care after other national systems that better contain costs. For example, the Germans and the Dutch spend one-third less on health care by more aggressively regulating prices, rationing care and spending much less on lawsuits.

Democrats would have to disappoint organized labor to push up the retirement age and disappoint tort lawyers to limit malpractice and class-action suits. Neither Mr. Obama nor congressional Republicans are inclined toward a mature discussion about prices and rationing in health care.

Mr. Obama and House Republicans indicate no interest in confronting Chinese mercantilism to accomplish more balanced trade with the Middle Kingdom. The president refuses to recognize that a bounty of natural gas, solar panels and windmills is not enough to accomplish energy independence. More drilling for oil in the Gulf of Mexico, off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and in Alaska is needed, too.

Yet, without better trade and energy policies to boost growth, significantly cutting the budget deficit will instigate another recession. Absent radical reforms in entitlement spending, Washington is headed for financial collapse by the end of the decade.

‘Back and Forth’

“I’m not certain that volleying back and forth publicly is the way to resolve this,” Conrad said. “Everything’s on the table now, which needed to happen.”

Trump spoke at this year 's Heritage Foundation 's President 's Club meeting in Washington . ( Oct. 17 ) AP
WASHINGTON — President Trump and aides expressed confidence Sunday they have the votes for a major overhaul of the tax system , despite a few warnings from lawmakers about certain aspects of the plan .
`` Our economy can not take off like it should unless we transform our outdated , complex and burdensome tax code , and that is exactly what we are proposing to do , '' Trump said in an op-ed for ███ .
In an interview broadcast Sunday on Fox News , Trump said the legislative setbacks suffered by him and Republicans during their efforts to pass a new health care plan wo n't affect the prospects of a tax cut .
`` I want to get it by the end of the year , but I ’ d be very disappointed if it took that long , '' Trump told Fox Business Network ’ s Maria Bartiromo .
`` So there ’ s a great spirit for it , people want to see it , and I call it tax cuts . It is tax reform also , but I call it tax cuts . It ’ ll be the biggest cuts ever in the history of this country , '' he said .
In Congress , some Republicans have expressed concern that massive tax cuts would explode budget deficits , while Democrats said they will fight any bill that benefits the wealthy at the expense of the middle class .
Sen. Sherrod Brown , D-Ohio , appearing on CNN 's State of the Union , said Democrats would work with Trump on a tax plan that benefits the middle class and working families but oppose him if he only wants to help rich people . Brown said Trump is at a `` fork in the road '' when it comes to taxes and relations with Democrats .
Some tax analysts and critics said the Trump team 's emphasis on tax cuts for the wealthy amount to a resurrection of `` trickle down economics , '' the undemonstrated theory that benefits to high earners will work their way down to the middle and lower classes ; they noted that Ronald Reagan 's administration tried the same thing , benefiting mainly the wealthy as federal budget deficts exploded .
Brown told CNN that White House meetings look `` far too much like a retreat for Goldman Sachs executives , '' and Trump aides keep whispering to him that all they want to do is `` trickle-down economics , big tax cuts for the wealthiest people in the country . ''

Lawmakers have cited projections that Trump 's proposed tax cuts would increase budget deficits by up to $ 1.5 trillion over 10 years .
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , who has long argued that tax reform should be `` revenue neutral '' and not add to budget deficits , told CNN that growth generated by the tax cuts would offset deficit increases .

WASHINGTON — President Trump and aides expressed confidence Sunday they have the votes for a major overhaul of the tax system, despite a few warnings from lawmakers about certain aspects of the plan.

""Our economy cannot take off like it should unless we transform our outdated, complex and burdensome tax code, and that is exactly what we are proposing to do,"" Trump said in an op-ed for USA TODAY.

In an interview broadcast Sunday on Fox News, Trump said the legislative setbacks suffered by him and Republicans during their efforts to pass a new health care plan won't affect the prospects of a tax cut.

""I want to get it by the end of the year, but I’d be very disappointed if it took that long,"" Trump told Fox Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo.

""So there’s a great spirit for it, people want to see it, and I call it tax cuts. It is tax reform also, but I call it tax cuts. It’ll be the biggest cuts ever in the history of this country,"" he said.

In Congress, some Republicans have expressed concern that massive tax cuts would explode budget deficits, while Democrats said they will fight any bill that benefits the wealthy at the expense of the middle class.

Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, appearing on CNN's State of the Union, said Democrats would work with Trump on a tax plan that benefits the middle class and working families but oppose him if he only wants to help rich people. Brown said Trump is at a ""fork in the road"" when it comes to taxes and relations with Democrats.

Some tax analysts and critics said the Trump team's emphasis on tax cuts for the wealthy amount to a resurrection of ""trickle down economics,"" the undemonstrated theory that benefits to high earners will work their way down to the middle and lower classes; they noted that Ronald Reagan's administration tried the same thing, benefiting mainly the wealthy as federal budget deficts exploded.

Brown told CNN that White House meetings look ""far too much like a retreat for Goldman Sachs executives,"" and Trump aides keep whispering to him that all they want to do is ""trickle-down economics, big tax cuts for the wealthiest people in the country.""

Lawmakers have cited projections that Trump's proposed tax cuts would increase budget deficits by up to $1.5 trillion over 10 years.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has long argued that tax reform should be ""revenue neutral"" and not add to budget deficits, told CNN that growth generated by the tax cuts would offset deficit increases.

McConnell also avoided commenting of reports that some officials want to reduce the limits on 401(k) contributions, though he predicted a legislative win in the long run.

""We're going to score a big legislative accomplishment here on tax reform in the near future,"" McConnell said on CNN's State of the Union.

This wasn ’ t a surprise . The woman was an undocumented housekeeper from El Salvador who had come to file her tax returns at Casa de Maryland , which hosts two federally subsidized tax centers that help low-income workers file their taxes for free .
So far this year , the group has helped 198 unauthorized immigrants file their taxes . While the woman and her tax preparer , Earvin Gonzalez , worked , about a dozen immigrants clutched folders full of receipts and tax paperwork and waited patiently in line for their turn .

Many are hoping it will help them get legal status one day . That has happened in past reform efforts , and one of the first requirements is usually to prove that a person has been paying taxes . That was the case for the undocumented youth granted temporary work permits under President Obama ’ s deportation-relief program , known as DACA . With the new administration ’ s fixation on a border wall , however , their chance of getting papers is more remote than ever .
Maria , whose name is being withheld because of her immigration status , handed a folder with tax documents from two jobs to Gonzalez . Her W-2 showed that a housecleaning company paid her $ 17,288 last year .
The Social Security number on the W-2 form is made up , Maria tells me , because she doesn ’ t have one . Her employer never asked for identification to verify it , she says . Instead , she has an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number ( ITIN ) , created by the IRS in 1996 so people who aren ’ t allowed to work in the United States could still file taxes on any money they earned . ( The IRS does not share ITIN information with immigration authorities . )
The agency doesn ’ t break down the number of tax returns filed this way , but in 2010 , it reported that about 3 million ITIN holders paid more than $ 870 million in income taxes . There are currently about 12 million unauthorized immigrants living in the United States , including children and the elderly .

“ What kind of jobs were these ? ” Gonzalez asks her in Spanish .
“ After cleaning houses , I would go lay concrete in parking lots , ” she says .

Gonzalez entered some deductions , such as the $ 1,500 she spent on equipment to pour and level concrete and the 12,000 miles she drove between job sites . Maria , who is a single mom , claimed two dependents : her 16-year-old son and 13-year-old daughter . With her ITIN number , she was able to claim child tax credits , but not the earned income tax credit , the major federal tax credit for low-income working families .
In the end , Maria owed $ 1,131 in income taxes to the state of Maryland and $ 775 to the federal government .

And workers who get a paycheck , like Maria , still have payroll taxes for Medicare and Social Security withheld from their paycheck , even if they put a fake Social Security number down on their W-2 form . The IRS estimates that unauthorized workers pay about $ 9 billion in payroll taxes annually .
In Maria ’ s case , the W-2 form showed that she paid $ 1,072 into Social Security and $ 251 into Medicare , two social safety net programs she will never benefit from .

Our 35 percent corporate tax rate has stayed in place for decades as our major trading partners cut their rates. The new tax rate of 21 percent should help us compete better for capital. Allowing businesses to write off the cost of investments more rapidly is another pro-growth win in the bill.

Tax Reform: A Mixed Bag

Overheated Rhetoric on Tax Reform",www.nationalreview.com,right,kJOspOYaPmFyCm2r
taxes,Fox News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/26/trump-tax-plan-reportedly-would-cut-small-business-rate-to-15-percent.html,Trump tax plan reportedly would cut small business rate to 15 percent,2017-04-26,,"President Trump 's tax reform plan would cut the top rate for small business owners to 15 percent from 39.6 percent , an official with knowledge of the plan told the Associated Press Tuesday .
The official added that the top tax rate for individuals would be cut from 39.6 percent to the `` mid-30s . '' White House officials had already revealed that Trump 's plan would reduce the top corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent .
The plan , which will be formally unveiled by Trump Wednesday , will also include child-care benefits , a cause promoted by Trump 's daughter Ivanka .
Republicans who slammed the growing national debt under Democrat Barack Obama said Tuesday they are open to Trump 's tax plan , even though it could add trillions of dollars to the deficit over the next decade .
Echoing the White House , Republicans on Capitol Hill argued that tax cuts would spur economic growth , reducing or even eliminating any drop in tax revenue .
`` I 'm not convinced that cutting taxes is necessarily going to blow a hole in the deficit , '' said Sen. Orrin Hatch , R-Utah , chairman of the Finance Committee .
`` I actually believe it could stimulate the economy and get the economy moving , '' Hatch added . `` Now , whether 15 percent is the right figure or not , that 's a matter to be determined . ''
The argument that tax cuts pay for themselves has been debunked by economists from across the political spectrum . On Tuesday , the official scorekeeper for Congress dealt the argument — and Trump 's plan — another blow .
The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation said Tuesday that a big cut in corporate taxes — even if it is temporary — would add to long-term budget deficits . This is a problem for Republicans because it means they would need Democratic support in the Senate to pass a tax overhaul that significantly cuts corporate taxes .

The official added that the top tax rate for individuals would be cut from 39.6 percent to the ""mid-30s."" White House officials had already revealed that Trump's plan would reduce the top corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent.

The plan, which will be formally unveiled by Trump Wednesday, will also include child-care benefits, a cause promoted by Trump's daughter Ivanka.

Republicans who slammed the growing national debt under Democrat Barack Obama said Tuesday they are open to Trump's tax plan, even though it could add trillions of dollars to the deficit over the next decade.

Echoing the White House, Republicans on Capitol Hill argued that tax cuts would spur economic growth, reducing or even eliminating any drop in tax revenue.

""I'm not convinced that cutting taxes is necessarily going to blow a hole in the deficit,"" said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Finance Committee.

""I actually believe it could stimulate the economy and get the economy moving,"" Hatch added. ""Now, whether 15 percent is the right figure or not, that's a matter to be determined.""

The argument that tax cuts pay for themselves has been debunked by economists from across the political spectrum. On Tuesday, the official scorekeeper for Congress dealt the argument — and Trump's plan — another blow.

The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation said Tuesday that a big cut in corporate taxes — even if it is temporary — would add to long-term budget deficits. This is a problem for Republicans because it means they would need Democratic support in the Senate to pass a tax overhaul that significantly cuts corporate taxes.

The assessment was requested by House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who has been pushing a new tax on imports to fund lower overall tax rates. Senate Republicans have panned the idea, and officials in the Trump administration have sent mixed signals about it.

The import tax is not expected to be part of Trump's plan.

Trump dispatched his top lieutenants to Capitol Hill Tuesday to discuss his plan with Republican leaders. They met for about half an hour. No Democrat was invited.

Afterward, Hatch called it, ""a preliminary meeting.""

""They went into some suggestions that are mere suggestions, and we'll go from there.""

But both senators are laying down a clear marker that they want the vast fortunes of the richest Americans to be a key source of future revenue.

Sanders’s estate tax proposal, explained

Until recently, US tax law allowed rich people to pass down $5.5 million untaxed to their heirs. But the 2017 Trump tax bill doubled that exemption to $11 million. Earlier this week, Senate Republicans introduced legislation to eliminate the estate tax entirely thus allowing billions to pass tax-free from today’s rich people to their children.

After campaigning on a broadly similar plan in 2016 that had a lower top rate, Sanders is back with a proposal that would do the opposite, instead creating a multi-tiered structure for taxing the largest estates, including:

A 77 percent rate on wealth over $1 billion

A 55 percent bracket on wealth from $50 million to $1 billion

A 50 percent bracket from $10 million to $50 million

A 45 percent bracket from $3.5 million to $10 million

The vast majority of Americans, obviously, do not inherit nearly that much money, but these relatively high rates mean that the tax would be a huge deal in practice to the richest American families. Sanders’s staff estimates, for example, that Warren Buffett’s tax liability would nearly double, from $33 billion to $64 billion.

From a policy perspective, of course, that’s exactly what Sanders is trying to accomplish — raise money from the biggest winners of the past generation of economic change and break up the large fortunes that allow a relatively small number of very wealthy individuals to wield disproportionate influence over the political system.

On a political level, conservatives typically argue against estate taxes (or as they call them, “death taxes”) by citing the supposed problems of family farmers and other owners of illiquid assets.The real policy argument from the right, however, is that wealth taxes are an especially pernicious form of taxation because over the long term, the accumulation of capital is the key to productivity and economic growth, and taxing wealth discourages that.

Wealth taxes, compared

Sanders’s staff estimates that their proposal would raise about $2.2 trillion in a 10-year window — but the exact nature of the window is uncertain because the impact of his plan is highly sensitive to the exact timing of the deaths of a relatively small number of ultra-wealthy individuals.

The Warren wealth tax proposal, by contrast, would levy an annual fee of 2 to 3 percent on large fortunes, and her team estimates it will raise $2.7 trillion in a standard Congressional Budget Office 10-year scoring window.

Przybyla,"CLOSE In a speech to the Heritage Foundation , President Trump outlined his new tax plan that he claims will mean bigger paychecks and financial independence . ███
WASHINGTON — President Trump 's upcoming push for his tax cut plan next month will include compromises that will limit some of its current benefits for the nation 's richest taxpayers , according to White House officials .
The compromises will include ending a 23.8 % preferential tax rate for hedge-fund managers , or the so-called carried interest rate , White House legislative affairs director Marc Short told ███ . `` He 's not just open to it , '' said Short . `` I would say , frankly , he wants it , '' he said .
Retaining parts of a state and local tax deduction that benefits many middle-class families in blue states is also an area where Trump is expecting compromise as House Republican negotiators hash out legislation capable of winning the support of a number of party members representing high-tax blue states like New Jersey and New York , said Short .
Later in November , Trump may also make his first address from the Oval Office to promote his plan to the nation , said sources involved with the planning who spoke on condition of anonymity because the plans were not final .
During a donor briefing last week in Orange County , California , Short said Trump is open to ideas being discussed on Capitol Hill , including a “ reverse cap , ” meaning taxpayers under a certain income could retain the benefit , according to one attendee who also spoke on the condition of anonymity . Changes Trump wants to the preferential carried interest income tax rate are unlikely to be supported by House Republican negotiators . leaving it as a bargaining chip in the Senate , where the fight over his plan is expected to be far fiercer .
The key to Trump ’ s success in selling the plan to middle America , which he ’ s dubbing a “ middle-class miracle , ” may be whether he can convince Americans that he is breaking with traditional Republican party orthodoxy on taxes benefiting the wealthy . Trump will have to make some significant compromises before Democrats agree with him .
Trump ’ s blueprint collapses individual income tax brackets to three , cuts the top corporate tax rate dramatically and creates a new top rate for small businesses that is lower than the top rate for individuals . It also eliminates two taxes paid entirely by the rich , while taking away a deduction for state and local taxes that is used most heavily in some of the most wealthy , and Democrat-dominated , states .
The plan is drawing criticism for eliminating the estate tax — which benefits the wealthy — while scrapping a state and local tax deduction benefiting many taxpayers living in high-cost states . At the same time , it could balloon the debt by trillions , which Republicans argue would be offset by increased economic growth .
During a bipartisan meeting on Wednesday with the Senate Finance Committee , Trump said his plan is something that should get bipartisan support .
“ This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity , in my opinion , ” Trump said , calling it the largest tax cut in U.S. history . He joked with Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon , the committee ’ s top Democrat , that it should get unanimous support . Wyden did not respond but smiled broadly .
The White House appears willing to make some compromises . White House Council of Economic Advisers Chair Kevin Hassett said Trump has given Congress a `` huge amount of leeway ” to get a bill that gets broad support , including setting where the new top rate should be .
Yet it 's far from clear that the trade offs under consideration will be enough for Democrats .
The challenges for Trump in ferrying his tax plan through Congress were on display Wednesday . After the bipartisan meeting , only Republicans , Sens . John Cornyn , John Thune and Pat Toomey , spoke to reporters . Cornyn said the meeting was “ enormously productive ” and Toomey said there were areas of bipartisan overlap . Yet no Democrats joined them , they didn ’ t specify those areas and refused to take questions from reporters .
According to Democrats who attended , Trump also expressed an openness to compromise , for instance , an employer tax credit for keeping jobs in the U.S. proposed by Sen. Sherrod Brown , D-Ohio
Yet later , during a call with reporters , Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania , a Democrat up for reelection in a state Trump won last November , said Republicans aren ’ t “ serious ” about a plan primarily benefiting the middle class . “ They don ’ t seem to be serious despite their rhetoric , ” said Casey , calling it a “ strange credulity ” that corporate rate cuts will benefit the middle class . He also said a Republican budget about to be finalized will “ lock in ” a process allowing a tax bill to pass with only Republican votes .
Democrats are also skeptical that Trump will keep his word , based on recent experience , including Trump ’ s reversal after negotiating with Democrats on a program for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children . They are also worried about being used to create an impression of bipartisanship even as they were excluded from the initial drafting of the plan . “ The ignoring ( of Democrats ) is ongoing , ” said Casey .
It was just two days before that Trump excoriated Democrats in a Rose Garden news conference , saying they are `` obstructionists '' who `` basically just want us to do badly . ''
In another sign of Trump ’ s offensive posture , White House officials seated Sen. Claire McCaskill , a Missouri Democrat , next to Trump instead of Wyden .
According to an individual close to the White House who dined with Vice President Mike Pence last week , the White House is angry at McCaskill after she ’ s criticized the tax plan during a series of recent town halls in her state and Trump is trying to send a message to her in particular of the political danger involved in rebuffing his tax plan .
McCaskill is among the Senate 's most vulnerable Democrats sitting for reelection , and in a recent rally in Springfield , Mo. , Trump urged her constituents to `` vote her out '' if she does n't support the plan .

WASHINGTON — President Trump's upcoming push for his tax cut plan next month will include compromises that will limit some of its current benefits for the nation's richest taxpayers, according to White House officials.

The compromises will include ending a 23.8% preferential tax rate for hedge-fund managers, or the so-called carried interest rate, White House legislative affairs director Marc Short told USA TODAY. ""He's not just open to it,"" said Short. ""I would say, frankly, he wants it,"" he said.

Retaining parts of a state and local tax deduction that benefits many middle-class families in blue states is also an area where Trump is expecting compromise as House Republican negotiators hash out legislation capable of winning the support of a number of party members representing high-tax blue states like New Jersey and New York, said Short.

Later in November, Trump may also make his first address from the Oval Office to promote his plan to the nation, said sources involved with the planning who spoke on condition of anonymity because the plans were not final.

During a donor briefing last week in Orange County, California, Short said Trump is open to ideas being discussed on Capitol Hill, including a “reverse cap,” meaning taxpayers under a certain income could retain the benefit, according to one attendee who also spoke on the condition of anonymity. Changes Trump wants to the preferential carried interest income tax rate are unlikely to be supported by House Republican negotiators. leaving it as a bargaining chip in the Senate, where the fight over his plan is expected to be far fiercer.

The key to Trump’s success in selling the plan to middle America, which he’s dubbing a “middle-class miracle,” may be whether he can convince Americans that he is breaking with traditional Republican party orthodoxy on taxes benefiting the wealthy. Trump will have to make some significant compromises before Democrats agree with him.

Trump’s blueprint collapses individual income tax brackets to three, cuts the top corporate tax rate dramatically and creates a new top rate for small businesses that is lower than the top rate for individuals. It also eliminates two taxes paid entirely by the rich, while taking away a deduction for state and local taxes that is used most heavily in some of the most wealthy, and Democrat-dominated, states.

The plan is drawing criticism for eliminating the estate tax — which benefits the wealthy — while scrapping a state and local tax deduction benefiting many taxpayers living in high-cost states. At the same time, it could balloon the debt by trillions, which Republicans argue would be offset by increased economic growth.

During a bipartisan meeting on Wednesday with the Senate Finance Committee, Trump said his plan is something that should get bipartisan support.

“This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, in my opinion,” Trump said, calling it the largest tax cut in U.S. history. He joked with Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the committee’s top Democrat, that it should get unanimous support. Wyden did not respond but smiled broadly.

White House compromises

The White House appears willing to make some compromises. White House Council of Economic Advisers Chair Kevin Hassett said Trump has given Congress a ""huge amount of leeway” to get a bill that gets broad support, including setting where the new top rate should be.

Yet it's far from clear that the trade offs under consideration will be enough for Democrats.

The challenges for Trump in ferrying his tax plan through Congress were on display Wednesday. After the bipartisan meeting, only Republicans, Sens. John Cornyn, John Thune and Pat Toomey, spoke to reporters. Cornyn said the meeting was “enormously productive” and Toomey said there were areas of bipartisan overlap. Yet no Democrats joined them, they didn’t specify those areas and refused to take questions from reporters.

According to Democrats who attended, Trump also expressed an openness to compromise, for instance, an employer tax credit for keeping jobs in the U.S. proposed by Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio

Yet later, during a call with reporters, Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, a Democrat up for reelection in a state Trump won last November, said Republicans aren’t “serious” about a plan primarily benefiting the middle class. “They don’t seem to be serious despite their rhetoric,” said Casey, calling it a “strange credulity” that corporate rate cuts will benefit the middle class. He also said a Republican budget about to be finalized will “lock in” a process allowing a tax bill to pass with only Republican votes.

Democrats are also skeptical that Trump will keep his word, based on recent experience, including Trump’s reversal after negotiating with Democrats on a program for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children. They are also worried about being used to create an impression of bipartisanship even as they were excluded from the initial drafting of the plan. “The ignoring (of Democrats) is ongoing,” said Casey.

It was just two days before that Trump excoriated Democrats in a Rose Garden news conference, saying they are ""obstructionists"" who ""basically just want us to do badly.""

Playing offense in red states

In another sign of Trump’s offensive posture, White House officials seated Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, next to Trump instead of Wyden.

According to an individual close to the White House who dined with Vice President Mike Pence last week, the White House is angry at McCaskill after she’s criticized the tax plan during a series of recent town halls in her state and Trump is trying to send a message to her in particular of the political danger involved in rebuffing his tax plan.

McCaskill is among the Senate's most vulnerable Democrats sitting for reelection, and in a recent rally in Springfield, Mo., Trump urged her constituents to ""vote her out"" if she doesn't support the plan. Two other Democratic senators in Trump-voting states, Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, were invited on Air Force One during his visits to their states.

Yet for Democrats like McCaskill, addressing provisions like the carried-interest tax rate may not be enough. “It’s hard to support something when we haven’t seen any details about what is being proposed,” McCaskill said in a statement following the meeting.

Targeting the carried-interest rate is something Trump discussed during his campaign. Trump said people who use the break, primarily venture capitalists and hedge fund managers, are “getting away with murder.” Even so, Trump did not go after the provision in his most recent blueprint.

Trump is hoping to give the plan a major push heading into December, with the assumption that a package will be on its way to the Senate by then. With Trump in Asia for more almost two weeks in November, the final weeks will be critical — both in selling the plan to the public and drumming up support in Congress. The White House is hoping that, by Thanksgiving, a House package will be on its way to the Senate.

What’s unclear is whether he’s willing to make bigger compromises, for instance, eliminating the estate tax, which the White House says is a big benefit to family-owned farms. Democrats say enriches a handful of the wealthiest Americans since it only affects estates worth more than $5 million.

“They will have to travel a great distance of hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars to have the rhetoric align,” said Casey.

Compromise is suddenly the watchword in Washington, as negotiations over taxes, spending and entitlements begin in advance of another self-imposed deadline, popularly known as the ""fiscal cliff.""

Automatic tax increases and deep spending cuts are slated for the first of the year, unless the president and Congress take action.

Leaders on both sides say they are willing to meet in the middle, but that makes their constituents worry about what any compromise will cost them.

But working through that final 20 percent could take some time .
Here are five tax reform issues that Republicans need to resolve .
House GOP leaders on tax reform are pushing for the changes to be permanent , but some senators and administration officials have expressed openness to temporary tax changes .
Procedural rules play into this debate . If Republicans want to pass a tax-reform bill under “ reconciliation ” to bypass a Democratic filibuster in the Senate , the legislation can ’ t increase the deficit outside of the budget window . As a result , a tax bill either needs to be revenue neutral — meaning that it won ’ t increase the deficit — or make the tax cuts on only a temporary basis .
The top tax-writers in the House want to produce a permanent tax bill that ’ s revenue neutral , after accounting for economic growth . They argue that permanent changes to the tax code are necessary for businesses ’ long-term planning .
But some GOP senators are more interested in producing legislation with a net tax cut , which could mean making the cuts temporary under reconciliation . Sen. Pat Toomey ( R-Pa. ) suggested in a Bloomberg View op-ed earlier this month that Congress could extend the budget window from the traditional 10 years to 20 or 30 years to enact longer-lasting tax cuts .
“ A 20- or 30-year tax reform would be as close to permanent as we can get since Congress would be likely to overhaul the tax code within that period anyway , ” he wrote .
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney have also said they are willing to consider lengthening the budget window . And Mnuchin has said that short-term tax cuts are preferable to no tax cuts at all .
`` Permanent is better than temporary , and temporary is better than nothing , '' he said at a hearing on Wednesday .
Republicans agree that they want to lower tax rates . But tax plans put forward by House Republicans and the White House diverge on how low to set tax rates for both individuals and businesses .
The tax plan the Trump administration unveiled in April proposes individual tax brackets of 35 percent , 25 percent and 10 percent . It also proposes a rate of 15 percent for both corporations and small businesses known as “ pass throughs ” whose income is taxed through the individual tax code on their owners ’ returns .
Meanwhile , the blueprint House Republicans released last year would establish individual tax rates of 33 percent , 25 percent and 12 percent . The corporate tax rate would be 20 percent , while pass-through businesses would pay a maximum rate of 25 percent .
Republicans argue that lowering the corporate tax rate is particularly important because the current rate of 35 percent is among the highest in the world , making American businesses less competitive .
But the lower the rates are , the more revenue loss the rate cuts would produce . That would mean that lawmakers would need to find more ways to pay for the rate cuts to avoid increasing the deficit .
The biggest fight over tax reform so far this year has centered on the House GOP ’ s border-adjustment tax ( BAT ) proposal .
Under the proposal , imports would be subject to a 20 percent tax that wouldn ’ t apply to exports . Proponents of the BAT say it would raise revenue to offset rate cuts and help prevent an erosion of the corporate tax base .
But the proposal ’ s fate doesn ’ t look good : GOP senators , administration officials and even some House Republicans have expressed concerns about its impact on consumers .
House GOP leaders are working on transition rules aimed at addressing concerns about the BAT ’ s impact on import-heavy industries . But Ryan also recently said he could see a situation where the House passes a tax bill that doesn ’ t include any border adjustment .
Without the BAT , lawmakers will have to find other ways to raise revenue and prevent corporations from shifting profits overseas .
After the BAT , the GOP tax plan ’ s language about business investment may be its next most hotly debated provisions .
The plan would eliminate the deduction for businesses ’ net interest expenses , instead allowing companies to immediately write off the full costs of their investments .
House GOP leaders believe that “ full expensing ” is a policy that would provide more of an incentive for businesses to invest . And the Tax Foundation estimates that eliminating the interest deduction would raise more than $ 1 trillion in revenue over 10 years .
But the interest deduction has its defenders , who say that debt financing is important to industries such as real estate , private equity , telecommunications and agriculture .
Mnuchin has said his preference is to keep interest deductibility , and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch Orrin Grant HatchTrump to award racing legend Roger Penske with Presidential Medal of Freedom Trump awards Presidential Medal of Freedom to economist , former Reagan adviser Arthur Laffer Second ex-Senate staffer charged in aiding doxxing of GOP senators MORE ( R-Utah ) told Bloomberg TV earlier this month that the deduction would be “ pretty tough to do away with . ”
The tax plans from House Republicans and the White House do not include infrastructure . But linking taxes and transportation may not be off the table , since Trump and some lawmakers have floated the idea .
Days after the administration released its tax plan , Trump told The Economist that he “ may align ” tax reform and infrastructure to get support from Democrats .
Additionally , a bipartisan group of House members in the Problem Solvers Caucus recently expressed support for pairing tax reform with infrastructure .
The issue of connecting tax reform and infrastructure has also divided prominent conservative thought-leaders .
Some of Trump ’ s former campaign advisers have suggested that Congress pass a business-only tax cut bill that also includes money for infrastructure , while anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist has warned that every additional dollar that goes to infrastructure can ’ t be used to cut taxes .","The Trump administration and congressional Republicans are working toward unifying around a single tax-reform bill, aiming to pass the legislation this year.

But some GOP senators are more interested in producing legislation with a net tax cut, which could mean making the cuts temporary under reconciliation. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) suggested in a Bloomberg View op-ed earlier this month that Congress could extend the budget window from the traditional 10 years to 20 or 30 years to enact longer-lasting tax cuts.

“A 20- or 30-year tax reform would be as close to permanent as we can get since Congress would be likely to overhaul the tax code within that period anyway,” he wrote.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney have also said they are willing to consider lengthening the budget window. And Mnuchin has said that short-term tax cuts are preferable to no tax cuts at all.

""Permanent is better than temporary, and temporary is better than nothing,"" he said at a hearing on Wednesday.

How low will the tax rates be?

Republicans agree that they want to lower tax rates. But tax plans put forward by House Republicans and the White House diverge on how low to set tax rates for both individuals and businesses.

The tax plan the Trump administration unveiled in April proposes individual tax brackets of 35 percent, 25 percent and 10 percent. It also proposes a rate of 15 percent for both corporations and small businesses known as “pass throughs” whose income is taxed through the individual tax code on their owners’ returns.

Meanwhile, the blueprint House Republicans released last year would establish individual tax rates of 33 percent, 25 percent and 12 percent. The corporate tax rate would be 20 percent, while pass-through businesses would pay a maximum rate of 25 percent.

Republicans argue that lowering the corporate tax rate is particularly important because the current rate of 35 percent is among the highest in the world, making American businesses less competitive.

But the lower the rates are, the more revenue loss the rate cuts would produce. That would mean that lawmakers would need to find more ways to pay for the rate cuts to avoid increasing the deficit.

What happens to the controversial border adjustment tax?

The biggest fight over tax reform so far this year has centered on the House GOP’s border-adjustment tax (BAT) proposal.

Under the proposal, imports would be subject to a 20 percent tax that wouldn’t apply to exports. Proponents of the BAT say it would raise revenue to offset rate cuts and help prevent an erosion of the corporate tax base.

But the proposal’s fate doesn’t look good: GOP senators, administration officials and even some House Republicans have expressed concerns about its impact on consumers.

House GOP leaders are working on transition rules aimed at addressing concerns about the BAT’s impact on import-heavy industries. But Ryan also recently said he could see a situation where the House passes a tax bill that doesn’t include any border adjustment.

Without the BAT, lawmakers will have to find other ways to raise revenue and prevent corporations from shifting profits overseas.

How will the tax bill treat business investments?

After the BAT, the GOP tax plan’s language about business investment may be its next most hotly debated provisions.

The plan would eliminate the deduction for businesses’ net interest expenses, instead allowing companies to immediately write off the full costs of their investments.

House GOP leaders believe that “full expensing” is a policy that would provide more of an incentive for businesses to invest. And the Tax Foundation estimates that eliminating the interest deduction would raise more than $1 trillion in revenue over 10 years.

But the interest deduction has its defenders, who say that debt financing is important to industries such as real estate, private equity, telecommunications and agriculture.

Mnuchin has said his preference is to keep interest deductibility, and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch Orrin Grant HatchTrump to award racing legend Roger Penske with Presidential Medal of Freedom Trump awards Presidential Medal of Freedom to economist, former Reagan adviser Arthur Laffer Second ex-Senate staffer charged in aiding doxxing of GOP senators MORE (R-Utah) told Bloomberg TV earlier this month that the deduction would be “pretty tough to do away with.”

Will tax reform be tied to infrastructure spending?

The tax plans from House Republicans and the White House do not include infrastructure. But linking taxes and transportation may not be off the table, since Trump and some lawmakers have floated the idea.

Days after the administration released its tax plan, Trump told The Economist that he “may align” tax reform and infrastructure to get support from Democrats.

Additionally, a bipartisan group of House members in the Problem Solvers Caucus recently expressed support for pairing tax reform with infrastructure.

The issue of connecting tax reform and infrastructure has also divided prominent conservative thought-leaders.

Some of Trump’s former campaign advisers have suggested that Congress pass a business-only tax cut bill that also includes money for infrastructure, while anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist has warned that every additional dollar that goes to infrastructure can’t be used to cut taxes.",www.thehill.com,center,vdpIal2eHF9VFBBc

President Trump’s attention-grabbing tax reform outline prompted the usual suspects to assume their usual positions Wednesday. Republicans argued that the plan would stimulate economic growth and make life simpler for taxpayers. Democrats attacked it as a windfall for wealthy interests and a budget buster.

In reality, the proposal has some good features, but they are far outweighed by the bad.

On the positive side, Trump is calling for a corporate tax rate of just 15%, down from 35%, which is one of the highest in the world. While many companies can avail themselves of myriad tax dodges, these often involve doing things that make little economic sense, such as parking huge amounts of cash overseas. So pruning back the corporate rate would benefit investors and American competitiveness alike.

Another worthy endeavor is Trump's plan to simplify individual returns, which represents the biggest such effort in three decades. All itemized deductions other than mortgage interest and charitable contributions would be eliminated, and the standard deduction would be doubled, sparing many taxpayers the need to itemize.

Unfortunately, the Trump plan also has enormous drawbacks. To the extent that anything can be concluded from a proposal so lacking in detail, it is that this is a dessert-first, no spinach, offering. Other than repealing most deductions, Trump specifies little about how to pay for the lower corporate and individual tax rates, so the great bulk of the cuts would presumably be financed through borrowing.

That makes this less a tax cut than a tax shift — from today’s taxpayers to their children and grandchildren. Including interest, the plan would add roughly $6.2 trillion to the national debt by 2027, according to non-partisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, on top of the already unconscionable $20 trillion in red ink.

Assertions by administration officials that the tax cuts will pay for themselves by spurring faster economic growth represent a return to the free-lunch, magical-thinking, supply-side economics practiced at the outset of other Republican administrations.

The other big problem with the Trump plan is that it would be a boon to the very wealthy, including the Trump family. The estate tax would be eliminated, as would be the alternative minimum tax. Owners of “pass-through” businesses, such as partnerships and S corporations, would pay just 15%.

Of course, it's impossible to say exactly how Trump would be affected because he has refused to release his tax returns and, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin reiterated Wednesday, has ""no intention"" of doing so.

The specter of presidential self-dealing and the lack of bipartisan outreach — targeting the deduction for state and local taxes guarantees fierce opposition from high-tax blue states — suggest that this plan should not, and probably will not, go very far.

Some of its effects are already visible , and some of them will take months , or even years , to understand . After all , economists are still publishing studies about the effect of the last comprehensive tax overhaul back in 1986 , signed by Ronald Reagan .
Here 's what we can — and ca n't — say about how President Donald Trump 's tax cuts have impacted the economy so far .
1 . Corporate taxes fell off a cliff , fueling deeper deficits
One of the central features of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was a drop in the corporate income tax rate , from 35 % to 21 % .
We were the highest taxed place on earth . Now we are not . '' Kevin Hassett , Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers
Even though plenty of companies never paid that full rate because of various exemptions , the decrease still took a big bite out of corporate tax collections . They plunged from a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of $ 264 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $ 149 billion the next , when the new rules went into effect , and they have n't bounced back .
Corporate income taxes make up only a small slice of the federal government 's overall tax revenue , and have declined as a share of the economy from their post-World War II height in 1951 . However , corporate tax revenue still tends to increase when the economy is doing well . This is the first time corporate taxes have taken such a hit when the economy is not in recession .
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office forecasts that corporate income tax revenues will gradually rise in the coming years , as will personal income taxes — but not enough for the tax cuts to `` pay for themselves , '' as their Republican backers claimed they would According to the CBO , the tax overhaul is set to add $ 1.85 trillion to the national debt over an 11-year period , even accounting for positive macroeconomic effects .
Congress has yet to take up spending cuts to big-ticket items like Medicare and Social Security that the White House had proposed to curb deficits . Still , mounting debt makes conversations around future expenditures more difficult . Lawmakers have choked on passing a large infrastructure package , for example , because there 's no plan to pay for it .
`` In some ways , our economy is held back by the public investments that we are not making , '' said Steve Wamhoff , director of federal tax policy for the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy . `` Even if we think that spending on infrastructure would be a good thing , politically we ca n't do this spending because we have to address this deficit . ''
Most economists forecast that the tax cuts , along with a boost to military spending , would goose the economy initially . The CBO estimates that about 0.3 percentage points of the 2.9 % growth in gross domestic product in 2018 can be attributed to the tax cuts .
Part of that came from an increase in business investment in research and development , new factories and equipment , possibly encouraged by a provision that allowed businesses to immediately expense capital expenditures , rather than expense them gradually over several years . Business investment grew 8.4 % from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter or 2018 . That 's a good sign because better factories , equipment and tools are supposed to boost productivity , which in some cases allows workers to make more money .
Wages did start to grow a bit faster at the end of 2018 , at least by some measures , especially for workers on the lower end of the income spectrum . But that was also a consequence of a tight labor market created by nearly a decade of continuous job growth , as well as minimum wage hikes in many states .
The White House 's Council of Economic Advisers used the growth surge in 2018 to trumpet the tax cuts as a success . The new lower corporate rate and temporary tax holiday on the repatriation of cash earned overseas , they argue , created a surge of investable capital — though companies returned a large chunk of it to investors in the form of share repurchases , mergers and acquisitions .
At the same time , they say the effects will take years to play out .
`` We were the highest taxed place on earth . Now we are not , '' said CEA Chair Kevin Hassett on CNN last week . `` The adjustment to having all the industry come home is not something that happens overnight , it spreads out over three to five years . ''
At the moment , though , trends are moving in the wrong direction . Business ' plans for capital expenditures have been declining for about a year now , according to an index maintained by Morgan Stanley . And aside from those who work for the White House , most economists — including those who work at the Federal Reserve and the International Monetary Fund — expect US economic growth to decline to about 2.1 % to 2.3 % in 2019 .
Why ? One possibility is that the boost in business investment may have had more to do with a rise in oil prices , which now drives a significant amount of domestic activity because of the US ' vast shale reserves , according to an analyst at the University of Pennsylvania 's Wharton School of Business .
The hurdle to investment in recent years has more to do with weak demand for goods rather than a shortage of capital , according to Kyle Pomerleau , chief economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation .
`` If you look at the US economy , it 's not lack of cash that 's keeping companies from investing , '' Pomerleau said . `` The whole issue is whether that cash can be deployed in a productive manner . Are there investments out there that result in a high enough after-tax return to be worthwhile ? ''
You have two tax policies working against one another . '' Kyle Pomerleau , Chief Economist at the Tax Foundation
As evidence that there are n't , most multinational companies have n't fundamentally changed the complex tax structures that allow them to book profits overseas , according to an analysis by Council on Foreign Relations senior fellow Brad Setser .
Meanwhile , the White House has engaged in a trade war that makes raw materials like lumber and steel more expensive in the US , raising the cost of domestic production .
`` You have two tax policies working against one another , '' Pomerleau says .
the overall effect of widening income inequality in America . About 66 % of taxpayers saw their federal tax bill decline by more than $ 100 in 2018 , the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation reported in March . And according to the tax preparation giant H & R Block , total liabilities are down by nearly 25 % . But the magnitude of those reductions varies a lot according to how much money you make , and has hadthe overall effect of widening income inequality in America .
Here 's one way of looking at it : As a result of both the business and personal income tax cuts , households making between $ 500,000 and $ 1 million will see their after-tax income rise by an average of 5.2 % . Households making less than $ 50,000 ( the median income is $ 61,372 in the US ) see only a 0.6 % increase .
In part , that 's because of a provision that allows taxpayers that earn money through `` pass-through '' businesses to take a deduction equal to 20 % of that income . Pass-through businesses include everything from architecture firms to part-time landlords incorporated as partnerships and limited liability companies .
`` The people who are benefiting the most , and the people who are benefiting the most through pass-throughs , are really rich people , '' said Jason Oh , a tax law professor at the University of California-Los Angeles .
Lower-income people , meanwhile , pay very little in taxes already and thus did n't benefit as much . They may even be hurt by the pass-through deduction . According to Nancy Abramowitz , head of the federal tax legal clinic at American University , employers have used it as a reason to encourage low-wage workers to become independent contractors , which also comes with the loss of many rights and benefits .
The tax act 's unequal distribution of benefits is now prompting calls for further changes to even the scales .
that would effectively boost subsidies for children and earned income . It attracted no Republican co-sponsors and had no price tag attached . But several announced Presidential candidates have similar plans , so if the Senate and the White House flip in 2020 , it stands a good chance of becoming law . Capitalizing on polling showing that most people believe the tax system is unfairly skewed towards the wealthy , 46 Senate Democrats have backed a bill that would effectively boost subsidies for children and earned income.It attracted no Republican co-sponsors and had no price tag attached . But several announced Presidential candidates have similar plans , so if the Senate and the White House flip in 2020 , it stands a good chance of becoming law .
4 . Most other impacts : Either too soon to tell or too hard to see
The 2017 tax overhaul either pleased or dismayed a host of special interests , but it 's still difficult to know whether their respective hopes or fears came true .
Take the mortgage interest deduction , which was capped at $ 750,000 in total amount borrowed and also weakened by the doubling of the standard deduction . Realtors worried that would put people off from buying homes — especially the most expensive ones .
So far , signals are mixed . New home sales increased in 2018 over the previous year , according to the National Association of Home Builders , even though construction permits leveled off . Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that some of that was likely due to several provisions in the tax overhaul , including the limitation on the mortgage interest deduction .
The homeownership rate , however , has continued to rebound from a low in 2016 . And the housing market is subject to so many other factors — from mortgage interest rates to the price of concrete — that it 's hard to isolate the impact of a tweaked tax provision .
The same is true of the capped state and local tax deduction , which disproportionately hurt states with high tax burdens like New Jersey and California . So far , according to a report by Moody 's Investor Service , there has n't been any noticeable uptick in migration out of those states ; many people move from one high-tax state to another .
`` Job opportunities and demographic trends influence migration more than tax rates , '' the report said .
Finally , nonprofits had fretted that since fewer people would be taking the charitable deduction , their contributions might sag . The Penn-Wharton Budget Model predicted the tax law would decrease charitable giving by $ 22 billion in 2018 . Instead , an annual report from the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy at Indiana University projected above-trend growth in giving for 2019 and 2020 , fueled by a healthy stock market and rising incomes .
However , the effect will be uneven . Lower-income filers will no longer benefit from the charitable deduction , which means the causes they favor may lose out .
`` Larger institutions that depend on higher-income households may not feel the impact , '' said Una Osili , who authored the Indiana University report . `` But if you think about the causes that everyday givers support , like community based organizations , they see more of an impact . ''
Most of the true impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is still yet to be felt . But one implication is already operating in the background . Tax cuts can help ease the impact of economic downturns , and now , there 's a lot less room to use them .
`` The thing that 's related that I 'm more concerned about is , we will eventually face another recession , '' says Oh , of UCLA . `` And what we 've done through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is use a bunch of the tools that we need to deal with the next recession , at a time when we do n't have a recession . ''","Monday is the first Tax Day under the new rules of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but Americans have been adapting to the law since it passed in late 2017.

Most of the true impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is still yet to be felt. But one implication is already operating in the background. Tax cuts can help ease the impact of economic downturns, and now, there's a lot less room to use them.

""The thing that's related that I'm more concerned about is, we will eventually face another recession,"" says Oh, of UCLA. ""And what we've done through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is use a bunch of the tools that we need to deal with the next recession, at a time when we don't have a recession.""",www.cnn.com,left,IIR69rkljpFB0m6J

House Republican leadership aides found some positive signals in Mr. Obama ’ s combative tone . They noted that he never specified he wants tax rates to rise , only that he wants additional revenues generated by taxes on the rich . That would give both sides the latitude to devise a restructured tax code that eliminates or limits tax deductions and credits for the rich — or that follows Mitt Romney ’ s proposal to cap deductions at a set limit for rich households , though many analysts say that approach alone can not raise the revenue Democrats want .
Any agreement to avert a fiscal crisis in January , when hundreds of billions of dollars in automatic tax increases and spending cuts kick in , now revolves around the definition of tax increases . Mr. Boehner is holding the line against any increase in tax rates , even for the richest Americans , who currently are in the 35 percent tax bracket . But he is leaving open the possibility of a tax overhaul that raises more revenue than the existing code .
Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland , the No . 2 Democrat , echoed the view at the White House that Americans want to see taxes on the wealthy go up . In a statement after Mr. Obama spoke , Mr. Hoyer said that “ on Tuesday , the American people made it clear that they support a balanced approach to bring down deficits and set our nation back on a sound fiscal path — one that does not ask working families and those struggling to get by to bear the burden of deficit reduction , but instead asks the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share . ”
While Mr. Obama was careful not to demand that tax rates rise , Jay Carney , the White House press secretary , said just an hour later that the president would veto any legislation extending the expiring tax cuts for families making $ 250,000 or more .
For all the talk of compromise , neither side offered any suggestion of where it might back down . While both sides agree on the need to avoid triggering the automatic tax increases and spending cuts that occur if there is no deal — and there is deep concern that failure could harm the economy — the shape of a final compromise remains unclear . New reports this week by the Congressional Budget Office found that the automatic tax increases and spending cuts would cut the deficit by $ 503 billion through next September . But the reports said that the austerity could cause the economy to shrink by 0.5 percent next year , and would lead to the loss of millions of jobs .
The Congressional leaders will be heading to the White House on Friday , administration officials said , just before Mr. Obama leaves for Cambodia , Myanmar and Thailand , where he will attend economic meetings with world leaders . He is certain to come under pressure there to reach a deal with Republicans since the American economy is doing better than most other global economies , and a slowdown in the United States is widely viewed as potentially catastrophic to the global economy .
“ It ’ s time to get back to work , ” the president said at the White House . “ And there is plenty of work to do . ”","“While there may be disagreement in Congress over whether or not to raise taxes on folks making over $250,000 a year, nobody — not Republicans, not Democrats — want taxes to go up for folks making under $250,000 a year,” he said. “So let’s not wait.”

Dennis Ventry , a professor at the School of Law at the University of California , Davis , who has studied the issue , said that while Free File and Intuit ’ s integrations with private companies were beneficial , they won ’ t be nearly as helpful as a government program to reform tax filing .
Mr. Ventry said that if return-free filing were operated nationally , tens of millions of people with simple tax situations might have to do just a few minutes of work at tax time every year .

Donald Trump says they should get a $ 1.1 million tax cut .
The poor , meanwhile , make out about the same no matter who is in the White House : a $ 100 tax cut under Mrs. Clinton and a $ 110 cut under Mr. Trump , according to an analysis released Tuesday by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center , which crunched the numbers and said Mr. Trump is more generous to taxpayers but does far more damage to federal revenue .
Indeed , Mr. Trump would open a $ 6 trillion gap in the federal budget over the next decade , and Mrs. Clinton would raise $ 1.4 trillion more in revenue . Almost all of that would come from those who make more than $ 3.7 million a year , the top 10th of a percent of American workers .
Mrs. Clinton tried to sweeten her plan for the poor and middle class on Tuesday , saying she would expand the child tax credit for families with children younger than 5 , doubling the maximum credit from $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 per child .
Mrs. Clinton said that is just “ a down payment ” and more relief is on the way .
“ Hardworking , middle-class families are struggling with rising costs for child care , health care , caregiving and college , ” Mrs. Clinton said . “ This new tax credit will make their lives a little bit easier and help restore fairness to our economy . ”
Adding the child credit helped improve Mrs. Clinton ’ s numbers , which show only a modest tax cut for most Americans .
Indeed , most taxpayers would get less than a couple of hundred bucks extra from the IRS under her plans . Those making $ 48,000 to $ 83,000 — the middle class — would average $ 110 extra , and those making $ 83,000 to $ 143,000 would average an extra $ 40 in 2017 .
Mr. Trump is far more generous , with those in the middle getting an additional $ 1,010 in tax relief and those making $ 83,000 to $ 143,000 receiving an extra $ 2,030 .
The biggest changes come for the wealthiest . Under Mr. Trump ’ s plan , the top 20 percent — those making more than $ 143,000 — would pay an average of $ 16,660 less . Under Mrs. Clinton , they would pay $ 6,690 more .
Those differences end up playing out in the federal budget , where Mr. Trump — absent giant spending cuts — would dramatically deepen deficits .
The Trump campaign has said his tax cuts would be deficit-neutral , which would mean those spending cuts would have to come from somewhere . The liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said the cuts would likely come from programs that help the poor because the wealthy don ’ t use those programs to the same extent .
Jacob Leibenluft , an economic adviser to Mrs. Clinton ’ s campaign , said the Trump plan amounted to “ massive giveaways to the richest Americans . ”
Stephen Miller , a senior adviser to Mr. Trump , dismissed the Tax Policy Center plan as fraudulent and said releasing it “ wasted everyone ’ s time. ” He said the Tax Policy Center — a joint operation between the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution — is biased toward Mrs. Clinton and that the study didn ’ t calculate the economic benefits of cutting taxes for the wealthy .
Mr. Trump has said that lower taxes will mean more jobs and a bigger economy , reducing the $ 6.2 trillion in revenue lost because of the rate cuts .
“ The Trump plan is revenue-neutral , massively cuts middle-class taxes and has huge child care benefits for low- and middle-income families , ” Mr. Miller said .
He also said the Tax Policy Center ignored some of the details of the Trump plan .
The center said Mr. Trump ’ s aides did not cooperate , so they had to make a number of assumptions they shared with the campaign . It said Mrs. Clinton ’ s campaign did cooperate and shared details of her proposed child tax credit even before it was announced .
Overall , Mr. Trump ’ s plan would cut the number of tax brackets and slash rates across the board . The marginal rate on the highest income bracket would drop to 33 percent . His plan cuts the corporate income tax rate to 15 percent , caps the level of deductions taxpayers can claim and eliminates the head-of-household filing status , but adds breaks for child care and increases the earned income tax credit .
Mrs. Clinton ’ s plan would impose a number of hikes on high-income households , including a 30 percent minimum tax that phases in beginning at $ 1 million . Among her many other tweaks are eliminating an Obamacare tax that would hit union members particularly hard and rules that would make it tougher to defer capital gains taxes .
Scott Greenberg , an analyst at the Tax Foundation , which is releasing its own analysis this week of the Trump and Clinton plans , said they generally match up with the Tax Policy Center ’ s analysis : The Trump plan would generally reduce taxes , with most of the gains going to well-off taxpayers , while Mrs. Clinton ’ s plan is a net tax increase , though many families would pay less .
Mr. Greenberg said Mr. Trump does deserve credit for trying to take some of the complexity out of the tax code .
“ Only one of the candidates in the race has even given lip service to the concept of tax simplicity , and that ’ s Trump , ” he said . “ Clintons ’ tax plan would unabashedly make the tax code more complicated . ”
One of the consequences of cutting deductions and eliminating the head-of-household filing status , though , is that it could “ cause many large families and single parents to face tax increases . ”","Hillary Clinton wants to sock the very wealthy with an $800,000-a-year tax increase.

Norquist ’ s comments came as King and some other top Republicans said they were willing to end their commitment to the pledge as Washington scrambles to find a deal that will fend off the looming fiscal cliff . On Sunday , King said that the “ taxpayer protection pledge ” —first offered in 1986 from Norquist ’ s organization , Americans for Tax Reform — isn ’ t binding today .
“ A pledge you signed 20 years ago , 18 years ago , is for that Congress , ” King said on NBC ’ s “ Meet the Press. ” “ For instance , if I were in Congress in 1941 , I would have supported a declaration of war against Japan . I ’ m not going to attack Japan today . ”
Most of the Republicans in Congress have signed Norquist ’ s pledge .
“ Hey , if you think a commitment is not for as long as you make it for , the commitment for the pledge , as Peter King well knows when he signed it , is that as long as you ’ re in Congress , you will [ rein in ] spending and reform government and not raise taxes , ” Norquist said . “ It ’ s not for 500 years or two generations .

The Republican Party is supposed to oppose tax increases and burdensome, unnecessary government regulations. But sometimes, they lose their way.

The most recent example is support by some Republicans for the misnamed Marketplace Fairness Act, which should really be called the Internet Tax Mandate. This mandate is nothing more than a huge tax increase on the American people backed by lobbyists and some state governments. I must admit, I am disappointed that some in my party are backing this ill-advised bill.

The Internet Tax Mandate would allow states to force private companies to impose a sales tax on online purchases. Rather than reform and prioritize their state budgets, governors are looking to the federal government to take more money out of the wallets of their state’s hardworking citizens. Americans are already struggling as a result of higher federal taxes, but some seek to soak the taxpayer at the state level as well.

Even worse, state politicians are already fantasizing about all the new spending programs they can create using these additional taxpayer dollars. The last thing we need is more taxes for the purpose of implementing more government.

State governments should be reining in spending and reducing regulation, not looking to Washington to extract even more money from American taxpayers. This is not the type of leadership we need coming from our state capitals.

At a time when businesses are already being strangled by job-destroying regulations, such as those imposed by Obamacare, the Internet Tax Mandate would add even more costs to our nation’s small businesses and job creators. The requirement to calculate sales-tax rates, much less collect those taxes, for each customer becomes even more burdensome when considering the various state, city and county sales taxes that will be imposed across the United States.

It is no surprise that larger corporations are lobbying vigorously in favor of this bill. After all, they will be able to absorb this additional cost of doing business, while their smaller competitors cannot.

If big companies really wanted to create a fairer marketplace, they would be lobbying the government for less regulation for all businesses, rather than working with government to harm competitors. Businesses should gain customers by providing better products and services than their competitors, not by using government to gain an advantage.

I ask my colleagues on Capitol Hill to reject any attempt at passing a national Internet Tax Mandate. Supporters of the bill have the backing of large corporations, expensive lobbyists and even bankrupt state governments, so it is up to us to stand up for small businesses, taxpayers and consumers.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid will push this legislation on the Senate floor next week, and I will offer an amendment to cut the corporate income-tax rate in half. We need to be lowering taxes, not raising them. We need to get government out of the way so more jobs can be created, not have more government at the expense of the private sector.

What we really need is freer markets, not government intervention or favoritism. For Republicans, less government should always be the answer. I encourage the American people to join me in urging Congress to do the right thing by rejecting the Internet Tax Mandate.

Williamson, Jim Geraghty, Kyle Smith, Luke Thompson, Zachary Evans, David French, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Tobias Hoonhout, Victor Davis Hanson","President Donald Trump ’ s tax-reform plan is in total a very expansive steaming pile of irresponsibility — and the president ’ s argument that it will lead to sustained 6 percent economic growth is pure fantasy — but it does have one attractive provision : raising taxes on blue-state progressives .
The plan would eliminate the deductibility of state and local income taxes for federal tax purposes . In the highest bracket , Californians are paying 13.3 percent in state income taxes , and that money comes off the top when those high-earning Silicon Valley types are calculating federal taxes . In New York City , the Wall Street guys are paying 8.82 percent to the state and another 3.876 percent to the city , which lowers their taxable federal income by almost 13 percent on the marginal dollar .
Eliminating deductibility for state and local income taxes is of course politically satisfying for mean-spirited conservatives such as myself — it constitutes a very substantial tax increase on the sort of well-kept and comfortable lefty Californians and New Yorkers from whom we tend to hear more than maybe we really want to on all sorts of political issues . Rich Democrats in Santa Monica and on the Upper West Side think we should have higher taxes , and we knuckle-dragging right-wingers down in Texas and Florida disagree . This way , everybody gets what he wants .
Like the mortgage-interest deduction , which the Trump plan unfortunately keeps ( the president loves his real estate and is the self-proclaimed “ king of debt ” ) , the deduction for state and local taxes was intended to be a benefit to the middle class , i.e. , the salt-of-the-earth voters who simultaneously are strongly in favor of an active welfare state and strongly disinclined to pay for it . ( American progressives who favor European-style social-welfare systems should take a look at the middle-class tax rates in Sweden or Norway , and then imagine the howling American mob they would face if they tried to replicate that necessary aspect of Eurotopia at home . ) The entitlement-hungry/tax-averse middle class could use a kick in the shins — if you want to take the ride , you ’ ve got to buy the ticket — but in reality the state-tax and mortgage-interest deductions mainly benefit higher-income households . That ’ s not surprising : High-income households make a lot of money , often have larger mortgages ( at least in absolute terms ) , and , to no one ’ s surprise , pay most of the taxes , both at the federal level and at the state and local levels . If you are paying the highest rate in California , you have a seven-figure income , so that deduction is really helpful against your federal tax burden . Less so if you make $ 50,000 a year .
The federal government uses the tax code for all sorts of social-engineering purposes : to encourage and subsidize investment in manufacturing or green-energy businesses , to reward charitable giving , to encourage homeownership . The federal government is not very good at social engineering : Its efforts to help low-income Americans with bad credit borrow money to buy houses they could not afford was a significant contributor to the subprime meltdown and financial crisis of 2008–2009 . Encouraging homeownership through subsidizing mortgage interest ( which is what that deduction actually does ) can encourage the wrong kind — the low-equity , high-interest kind — of homeownership . Likewise , offsetting state income taxes encourages states to jack up their levies : Because some costs are passed on to the federal treasury , Sacramento can get $ 1 in state income-tax revenue at a real cost to California taxpayers of less than $ 1 .
The federal government really should not use the tax code to encourage or discourage any kind of behavior . It should use the tax code to raise the money necessary for the operation of the federal government in a way that minimizes economic damage and market distortion .
You don ’ t want to say this out loud in Texas , but it is not necessarily a bad thing for states to have income taxes , or even high income taxes . Different states fund their operations in different ways , and different states require different kinds of government . Massachusetts is not very much like Wyoming . Texas is very happy not to have an income tax , but its effective property tax rate is about twice California ’ s .
The states are responsible for themselves , and Californians and New Yorkers can and should be expected to pay the full cost of the governments they elect and the policies they support .
Of course , some states manage to offer the worst of both worlds : New Jersey residents pay high income taxes and high property taxes , as do the poor people of benighted Connecticut and eternally misgoverned Illinois . But , you know what ? They have elections in those states .
The federal government should take a neutral stance on how states choose to fund their governments . Some have higher income taxes , some rely on property taxes . Some have higher sales taxes , and a few have no sales taxes at all . That really is not any business of the U.S. Treasury ’ s .
Conservatives and libertarians make a hobby out of dreaming up replacements for the current federal tax system — a national sales tax , a VAT , the so-called Fair Tax , financial-transaction taxes , etc . — and the tax code is in need of reform . But , realistically , what we have is what we ’ re probably going to have for the foreseeable future , at least in terms of the general revenue architecture : taxes on individual and business income , taxes on investment income , and certain excise taxes . The best , most direct , and most conservative course of action is simplifying the tax code we already have , reducing the number of brackets ( down to one , preferably ) , and removing the various corporate-welfare and social-engineering schemes inserted into it over the years .
The states are responsible for themselves , and Californians and New Yorkers can and should be expected to pay the full cost of the governments they elect and the policies they support . The states remain , after all , sovereign , the dual sovereignty of the states and the federal government being one of the unique features of American government . That dual sovereignty has been eroded in past decades , and not only by the nationalizing passion of the progressives . In the midst of all this ghastly new talk of “ nationalism ” on the right , you can barely hear voices issuing forth from the graves of Thomas Jefferson and Samuel Adams , saying : “ No , thanks ! ” But we have not gone so far down that road that the states have been reduced to mere administrative subdivisions of the federal government — even if they ’ ll ask to be treated as federal dependents when their unpayable pension bills come due .
California is very expensive by American standards and a bargain by world standards . As it turns out , people are pretty good at figuring that out : California has for some years been losing its native-born population to the other 49 states , but those emigrants are more than replaced by immigrants from around the world , many of them from places that make California look lightly taxed and well governed . ( Which it is , by comparison with India or Venezuela . ) That isn ’ t how I ’ d do things if I were the Emperor of Malibu , but Californians , so far , seem to be content with their own way of doing things . Let California be California .
NR Editorial : An Opportunity for Pro-Growth and Pro-Family Tax Reform","(Photo: Americanspirit/Dreamstime)

Donald Trump’s blue-state tax increase is good policy.

President Donald Trump’s tax-reform plan is in total a very expansive steaming pile of irresponsibility — and the president’s argument that it will lead to sustained 6 percent economic growth is pure fantasy — but it does have one attractive provision: raising taxes on blue-state progressives.

The plan would eliminate the deductibility of state and local income taxes for federal tax purposes. In the highest bracket, Californians are paying 13.3 percent in state income taxes, and that money comes off the top when those high-earning Silicon Valley types are calculating federal taxes. In New York City, the Wall Street guys are paying 8.82 percent to the state and another 3.876 percent to the city, which lowers their taxable federal income by almost 13 percent on the marginal dollar.

Eliminating deductibility for state and local income taxes is of course politically satisfying for mean-spirited conservatives such as myself — it constitutes a very substantial tax increase on the sort of well-kept and comfortable lefty Californians and New Yorkers from whom we tend to hear more than maybe we really want to on all sorts of political issues. Rich Democrats in Santa Monica and on the Upper West Side think we should have higher taxes, and we knuckle-dragging right-wingers down in Texas and Florida disagree. This way, everybody gets what he wants.

You’re welcome.

Getting rid of state-tax deductibility is also good policy.

Like the mortgage-interest deduction, which the Trump plan unfortunately keeps (the president loves his real estate and is the self-proclaimed “king of debt”), the deduction for state and local taxes was intended to be a benefit to the middle class, i.e., the salt-of-the-earth voters who simultaneously are strongly in favor of an active welfare state and strongly disinclined to pay for it. (American progressives who favor European-style social-welfare systems should take a look at the middle-class tax rates in Sweden or Norway, and then imagine the howling American mob they would face if they tried to replicate that necessary aspect of Eurotopia at home.) The entitlement-hungry/tax-averse middle class could use a kick in the shins — if you want to take the ride, you’ve got to buy the ticket — but in reality the state-tax and mortgage-interest deductions mainly benefit higher-income households. That’s not surprising: High-income households make a lot of money, often have larger mortgages (at least in absolute terms), and, to no one’s surprise, pay most of the taxes, both at the federal level and at the state and local levels. If you are paying the highest rate in California, you have a seven-figure income, so that deduction is really helpful against your federal tax burden. Less so if you make $50,000 a year.

The federal government uses the tax code for all sorts of social-engineering purposes: to encourage and subsidize investment in manufacturing or green-energy businesses, to reward charitable giving, to encourage homeownership. The federal government is not very good at social engineering: Its efforts to help low-income Americans with bad credit borrow money to buy houses they could not afford was a significant contributor to the subprime meltdown and financial crisis of 2008–2009. Encouraging homeownership through subsidizing mortgage interest (which is what that deduction actually does) can encourage the wrong kind — the low-equity, high-interest kind — of homeownership. Likewise, offsetting state income taxes encourages states to jack up their levies: Because some costs are passed on to the federal treasury, Sacramento can get $1 in state income-tax revenue at a real cost to California taxpayers of less than $1.

That’s back-door tax-code welfare for big-spending Democrats.

The federal government really should not use the tax code to encourage or discourage any kind of behavior. It should use the tax code to raise the money necessary for the operation of the federal government in a way that minimizes economic damage and market distortion.

You don’t want to say this out loud in Texas, but it is not necessarily a bad thing for states to have income taxes, or even high income taxes. Different states fund their operations in different ways, and different states require different kinds of government. Massachusetts is not very much like Wyoming. Texas is very happy not to have an income tax, but its effective property tax rate is about twice California’s.

The states are responsible for themselves, and Californians and New Yorkers can and should be expected to pay the full cost of the governments they elect and the policies they support.

Of course, some states manage to offer the worst of both worlds: New Jersey residents pay high income taxes and high property taxes, as do the poor people of benighted Connecticut and eternally misgoverned Illinois. But, you know what? They have elections in those states.

The federal government should take a neutral stance on how states choose to fund their governments. Some have higher income taxes, some rely on property taxes. Some have higher sales taxes, and a few have no sales taxes at all. That really is not any business of the U.S. Treasury’s.

Conservatives and libertarians make a hobby out of dreaming up replacements for the current federal tax system — a national sales tax, a VAT, the so-called Fair Tax, financial-transaction taxes, etc. — and the tax code is in need of reform. But, realistically, what we have is what we’re probably going to have for the foreseeable future, at least in terms of the general revenue architecture: taxes on individual and business income, taxes on investment income, and certain excise taxes. The best, most direct, and most conservative course of action is simplifying the tax code we already have, reducing the number of brackets (down to one, preferably), and removing the various corporate-welfare and social-engineering schemes inserted into it over the years.

The states are responsible for themselves, and Californians and New Yorkers can and should be expected to pay the full cost of the governments they elect and the policies they support. The states remain, after all, sovereign, the dual sovereignty of the states and the federal government being one of the unique features of American government. That dual sovereignty has been eroded in past decades, and not only by the nationalizing passion of the progressives. In the midst of all this ghastly new talk of “nationalism” on the right, you can barely hear voices issuing forth from the graves of Thomas Jefferson and Samuel Adams, saying: “No, thanks!” But we have not gone so far down that road that the states have been reduced to mere administrative subdivisions of the federal government — even if they’ll ask to be treated as federal dependents when their unpayable pension bills come due.

California is very expensive by American standards and a bargain by world standards. As it turns out, people are pretty good at figuring that out: California has for some years been losing its native-born population to the other 49 states, but those emigrants are more than replaced by immigrants from around the world, many of them from places that make California look lightly taxed and well governed. (Which it is, by comparison with India or Venezuela.) That isn’t how I’d do things if I were the Emperor of Malibu, but Californians, so far, seem to be content with their own way of doing things. Let California be California.

And let Californians pay for it.

President Obama faces huge, and probably insurmountable, obstacles to reviving a grand bargain — none higher and more difficult to overcome than his decision to increase taxes by $600 billion in December.

At the time, Obama claimed victory, slapping new taxes on the rich while protecting George W. Bush’s cuts for everyone else. In retrospect, it looks more like a missed opportunity than a political or policy triumph.

Obama thought he would be able to stare down Republicans over the sequester, and get them to double the size of his tax increase to avoid heavy defense cuts. He was wrong. Once Republicans swallowed the $600 billion in hikes, they made plain they were done raising taxes for this Congress. And they really are done, Republicans say.

This is the biggest reason top Democrats and Republicans alike tell us talk of a grand bargain this time around is way overhyped — though, as our colleagues Jake Sherman and Carrie Budoff Brown wrote last week, Obama’s recent charm offensive shows he knows he now needs a sweeping deal more than ever.

“Nobody is even talking about a grand bargain,” one of the Senate’s most influential Democratic leadership aides told us. “It is not even on our radar right now.” An adviser to Speaker John Boehner told us that window was slammed shut by Obama’s hardball tactics since the tax hike. “He missed the chance.”

The main reason that President Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress are pursuing fundamental tax reform this year is because the American economy has not seen annual economic growth above 3% since 2005. This is an indictment of decades of unabated growth in the complexity of the tax code, devoid of any meaningful attempt to permanently reduce tax burdens for all Americans.

This year, Americans will spend billions of dollars and countless hours trying to comply with the a staggeringly complex, 70,000-page, federal tax code. This is an effective tax on top of what Americans and their businesses owe.

The IRS’ own Taxpayer Advocate Service lists tax code complexity as one of the most serious issues facing taxpayers. Every dollar and hour spent attempting to avoid the wrath of the IRS is one less creating jobs that actually grow the economy, not subsidize accountants and lawyers.

The tax code is also oppressive in terms of its direct impact. American businesses face the highest corporate income tax rate in the industrialized world, north of 40% when factoring in state taxes. And Congress has increasingly used the tax code to micromanage the economy and pick winners and losers. The purpose of taxes is to fund the essential functions of our government laid out in the Constitution, not to allow government to play favorites in the private sector.

This week, FreedomWorks released our six principles for fundamental tax reform. Two of the principles President Trump effectively hits hardest are lowering individual tax rates and reducing corporate tax rates. With a greater standard deduction for individuals and a dramatically slashed rate for corporations, this idea is on track to see economic growth of 3% to 4% and put the American economy back on track.

In sum, Americans not only need tax relief, they also need tax certainty. Americans can’t take the long-term risks necessary to grow the economy if they can’t count on being able to keep their hard-earned money and not fall victim to ever-changing rules.

Far From It.,2017-12-19,"Peter Suderman, Elizabeth Nolan Brown, Josh Blackman, Charles Oliver, John Stossel, Eric Boehm, Shikha Dalmia","Sometime today , both the House and the Senate will hold final votes on the tax legislation that has been working its way through Congress this year . And then , tomorrow , President Trump will sign it into law .
Democrats have treated the bill 's passage as an apocalyptic event . Earlier this month , when a previous iteration of the bill passed in the Senate , Nancy Pelosi , the Democratic House Minority Leader , declared that it was literally the apocalypse . `` It is the end of the world , '' she said , singling out the bill 's repeal of the individual mandate . `` This is Armageddon . '' How perilous the world must seem to her that this muddled bit of tax cutting could bring it all down .
Pelosi 's apoplectic reaction offers , among other things , a reminder of how long it has been since Republicans last passed major legislation , and how unhinged the responses to such an event can be . The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( TCJA ) is not the end of the world , nor anything close . It is not even , unfortunately , the end of the tax code as we know it .
Instead , it is a predictable , conventional piece of Republican tax legislation , one that cuts taxes for corporations and individuals while sharply increasing the deficit . It is the sort of thing you can imagine passing , more or less , under Mitt Romney or John McCain or Jeb Bush . Which means , of course , that it has all the problems , and benefits , of conventional Republican thinking about taxes .
Among those benefits is the bill 's centerpiece : a permanent reduction in the corporate tax rate , from 35 percent , the highest in the developed world , down to 21 percent . There is little serious disagreement amongst mainstream economists that America 's corporate tax rate is too high . In 2012 , President Obama proposed slashing it to 28 percent . Predictably , the Republican plan goes further , but it still leaves America with a rate that is higher than the European average of 18.8 percent . Cutting corporate taxes may not provide the sort of quick boost to job creation or economic growth that some of its more enthusiastic backers claim . But it positions the nation to be more competitive internationally in the long term by permanently reducing the cost of doing business in the United States .
Corporations are not the only beneficiaries of the bill 's cuts to tax rates , however . The plan cuts tax rates across all seven tax brackets , doubles the standard deduction ( while eliminating the personal exemption ) , expands the child tax credit , and alters the alternative minimum tax so that it will affect fewer people . According to an analysis the Tax Policy Center , these changes would reduce taxes for every income group . Only about five percent of taxpayers would pay more next year .
The bill is broadly unpopular , and has been widely misunderstood by the public , with one recent poll showing that a majority of the public believes their taxes will go up under the bill . In fact , it will reduce taxes for most Americans . If you are reading this , you will most likely get to keep more of your money as a direct result of this legislation .
At least , that is , for the next several years . The individual tax reductions , including the doubling of the standard deduction , are all set to expire at the end of 2025 . This is where the bill 's problems become more apparent .
Sunsetting these provisions allows the bill to comply with the Senate 's self-imposed requirement that the bill not increase the deficit by more than $ 1.5 trillion over the next decade . Republicans , however , have argued that the provisions wo n't really expire , because no future Congress would allow middle-class taxes to rise . `` Those are sunsets that will never occur , we do n't believe will ever occur , we do n't intend to ever occur , '' House Speaker Paul Ryan said last month at event hosted by The Washington Examiner .
This may well be true . Under President Obama , the vast majority of the temporary tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush were made permanent .
The problem is that if it is true , and the provisions do n't expire , then the bill will increase the deficit far more than projected . What Republicans are arguing , essentially , is that the actual text of the legislation should be ignored , because the authors do not intend for the bill to be implemented as written . It is effectively an argument for intentional legislative deceit . At best , it asks for support on the basis of a transparent budget gimmick .
The bill also repeals the individual mandate to maintain health coverage that was part of the Affordable Care Act . This wo n't repeal Obamacare , as the subsidies , regulations , and Medicaid expansion will be left in place . But it might partially hobble it , sparking political blowback in the process .
The main ███ for repealing the individual mandate is that it provides about $ 340 billion in deficit reduction , helping to offset the budgetary effects of the tax cuts , because , according to the Congressional Budget Office , about 13 million fewer people will choose to obtain government subsidized health coverage . Republicans have credibly argued that the estimated coverage loss is too high ; if so , however , that means the deficit reduction is smaller too . It 's another budget gimmick — an attempt to have it both ways .
Indeed , Republicans are also promising that the bill wo n't raise the deficit at all . Although static estimates suggest that it would raise the deficit by a little more than $ 1.4 trillion , Republican leadership maintains that this will be made up via new revenue from increased economic growth . The bill , Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said earlier this year , would `` pay for itself . '' On the night the bill passed in the Senate , Majority Leader Mitch McConnell even went so far as to declare that it would result in an increase in government revenue .
Not a single independent analysis backs up this claim . The most favorable estimates , which assume large dynamic effects stemming mostly from the corporate tax cut , project that growth will make up for about $ 1 trillion in lost tax revenue . An analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that the total hit to the deficit could amount to $ 2.2 trillion . That this comes after eight years of blistering GOP criticism about debt and deficit increases under Obama is more than a little telling .
Republicans did produce one short document outlining their argument for growth . It provided no detailed analysis , yet concluded that the bill would pay for itself via `` a combination of regulatory reform , infrastructure development , and welfare reform as proposed in the Administration 's Fiscal Year 2018 budget . '' In other words , the bill , on its own , wo n't actually pay for itself .
It is an admission that even under the most generous assumptions , GOP claims about the bill 's likely effects have no realistic basis . Republicans may not exactly be lying about the bill , but they are certainly bullshitting .
There are other problems with the legislation as well : It provides a tax break for pass-through corporations , which pay at the individual rate , in a way that is nearly certain to encourage accounting gimmicks and other types of tax arbitrage . When Republican lawmakers in Kansas set up a similar provision , it encouraged tax avoidance but not economic growth , according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation . Republicans sold tax reform on the notion that it would simplify the tax code , reducing opportunities for gaming the system . Instead they have produced a bill that provides an incentive for complex tax-avoidance schemes .
Meanwhile , Republicans won over holdout votes with sketchy side-deals , at least one of which appears to directly benefit a number of Republican legislators . Republican leaders have n't even bothered to pretend that these add-ons have a purpose beyond buying votes .
And even backers agree that the text of the legislation , which was hastily written and rushed through the legislative process , has numerous errors and glitches in need of correction . Rep. Kevin Brady ( R-Texas ) , who helped design the legislation , has already said that he anticipates a follow-up bill with technical corrections . Republicans are passing this bill into law despite knowing that it is a shoddily constructed mess .
This is not the first piece of partisan legislation to be passed with apparent gimmicks , glitches , and handouts . When Democrats wrote the health care law that became Obamacare , they structured it with gimmicks intended to make it score as reducing the deficit .

“ Pay attention here , ” Mr. Obama said . “ Folks making more than $ 3 million a year — the top one-tenth of 1 percent — they would get a tax cut under Mr. Romney ’ s plan that is worth almost a quarter of a million dollars . Hold on , it gets worse , ” he added to a chorus of boos . “ My opponent says he ’ s going to pay for this $ 5 trillion plan . But under this plan , guess who gets the bill for these $ 250,000 tax cuts ? You do . And you don ’ t have to take my word for it. ” Mr. Obama cited a new study from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute , two centrist Washington-based policy research organizations . The analysis concluded that the sort of tax code that Mr. Romney has proposed “ would provide large tax cuts to high-income households , and increase the tax burdens on middle- and/or lower-income taxpayers . ”
( 1 ) Right out of the gate , let 's acknowledge that this is at least a legitimate and relevant subject of debate . Most of the Democrats ' anti-Romney attacks have involved lying about his business record ( `` Four Pinocchios '' ) , lying about his stance on abortion ( `` pants on fire '' ) , and accusing him of being a criminal on two separate occasions , each time with zero proof . Therefore , a debate about tax plans and how they 'd affect the country offers a welcome respite from silly season .
( 2 ) As he distorts Romney 's tax plan on the stump , the president bases his claim on an `` independent '' study . He fails to mention that this report was co-authored by one of his former advisors .
( 3 ) As Phil Klein notes , the study itself does n't even purport to `` score Romney 's plan directly : ''
The first paragraph of the study notes : ( We do not score Governor Romney ’ s plan directly , as certain components of his plan are not specified in sufficient detail , nor do we make assumptions regarding what those components might be . ) Yet here ’ s what Obama said yesterday at a campaign stop in Mansfield , Ohio : Just today , an independent , nonpartisan organization ran all the numbers on Governor Romney ’ s plan .
( 4 ) AEI 's Jim Pethokoukis runs down a litany of issues with the study 's methodology and ( crucially ) growth assumptions , although he and I agree on one point : More details from Romney are in order . The presumptive nominee has given us the fun part ( 20 percent across the board rate reductions ) , without outlining the pain ( which deductions will be limited or eliminated ? ) This makes sense politically , because the more details Romney reveals , the more Democrats will cherry-pick and twist them into attacks . So while I understand why Team Romney is reluctant to tip its hand too much here , we 'll need more complete information eventually .
( 5 ) Pethokoukis suggests one intriguing way for Romney to mitigate some of this criticism -- embrace the Obama Fiscal Commission 's tax plan :
So basically we would have a simpler system , less vulnerable to crony capitalism , with a top marginal tax rate back to where it was during the Reagan years . And on top of that , the corporate rate under Simpson-Bowles would be 28 % vs. 35 % today , helping offset the minor-though-regrettable rise in capital gains and dividend rates . One objection from the right is that this plan would raise taxes . This portion of the S-B plan would raise tax revenues , on a static basis , by $ 785 billion over a decade due to fewer tax breaks . But given the huge drop in individual and marginal rates — plus the efficiency gains from a less distorted system — I have a hard time believing this would not grow the pie , leaving taxpayers far better off than they would be after a decade of slow growth or Lost Decade .
This would undoubtedly prompt significant push-back on the Right , but I 'm inclined to agree with Pethokoukis on the net positive effect . He also describes the tantalizing political advantages of embracing the Simpson/Bowles tax structure :
The political benefits would immense . Romney would be adopting the plan of Obama ’ s own bipartisan debt commission , which Obama stiff-armed after promising Simpson and Bowles that he would endorse its recommendations . ( One big reason Obama rejected it is because it lowers marginal rates and keep taxes way too low to finance future liberal spending plans . ) Romney would look like a leader who wants to get things done in 2013 . And since the plan would actually result in Romney paying a great percentage of his income in taxes , it would help inoculate him on the fairness issue .
Obama would surely demagogue the plan anyway , but Romney could turn around and hammer him over the fact that it 's derived his own debt commission 's proposal , which he ignored . ( He appointed this commission after deriding and dismissing commissions as a candidate ) . It could also open the door to a renewed and serious discussion of entitlement reform , which Simpson/Bowles laid out and Obama neglected .
( 6 ) The president has the vapors over Romney 's `` plan '' to raise taxes on the middle class . Complication : His own policies have actually raised taxes on lower-income voters many times over . They 've done so mostly through a litany of Obamacare taxes , including the mother-load : The mandate tax . Obama 's current tax plan ( calling it a `` plan '' is generous ) involves destructive hikes on `` the rich , '' including nearly one million small businesses . These businesses account for more than half of small business income in America . The Obama hikes would not dent the debt ( Democrats want increased revenues to fund more spending anyway ) , but they would kill 700,000 jobs . Just what the economy needs ! Would n't you say so , 2010 's Barack Obama ?","President Obama's new line of attack against Mitt Romney is that the Republican's tax plan would raise taxes on everyone except for the very wealthy:

And on top of that, the corporate rate under Simpson-Bowles would be 28% vs. 35% today, helping offset the minor-though-regrettable rise in capital gains and dividend rates. One objection from the right is that this plan would raise taxes. This portion of the S-B plan would raise tax revenues, on a static basis, by $785 billion over a decade due to fewer tax breaks. But given the huge drop in individual and marginal rates — plus the efficiency gains from a less distorted system — I have a hard time believing this would not grow the pie, leaving taxpayers far better off than they would be after a decade of slow growth or Lost Decade.



This would undoubtedly prompt significant push-back on the Right, but I'm inclined to agree with Pethokoukis on the net positive effect. He also describes the tantalizing political advantages of embracing the Simpson/Bowles tax structure:



The political benefits would immense. Romney would be adopting the plan of Obama’s own bipartisan debt commission, which Obama stiff-armed after promising Simpson and Bowles that he would endorse its recommendations. (One big reason Obama rejected it is because it lowers marginal rates and keep taxes way too low to finance future liberal spending plans.) Romney would look like a leader who wants to get things done in 2013. And since the plan would actually result in Romney paying a great percentage of his income in taxes, it would help inoculate him on the fairness issue.



Obama would surely demagogue the plan anyway, but Romney could turn around and hammer him over the fact that it's derived his own debt commission's proposal, which he ignored. (He appointed this commission after deriding and dismissing commissions as a candidate). It could also open the door to a renewed and serious discussion of entitlement reform, which Simpson/Bowles laid out and Obama neglected.

(6) The president has the vapors over Romney's ""plan"" to raise taxes on the middle class. Complication: His own policies have actually raised taxes on lower-income voters many times over. They've done so mostly through a litany of Obamacare taxes, including the mother-load: The mandate tax. Obama's current tax plan (calling it a ""plan"" is generous) involves destructive hikes on ""the rich,"" including nearly one million small businesses. These businesses account for more than half of small business income in America. The Obama hikes would not dent the debt (Democrats want increased revenues to fund more spending anyway), but they would kill 700,000 jobs. Just what the economy needs! Wouldn't you say so, 2010's Barack Obama?

Obama, the ringleader

The president tipped to his approach at his news conference Wednesday.

He’ll first pressure House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) to put up for a vote the bill that passed the Senate in July extending the tax cuts for families earning $250,000 or less, according to people briefed on the strategy.

Nobody expects Boehner to go for it, but the exercise serves an important political purpose for the White House. It positions House Republicans so intent on protecting tax cuts for the wealthy that they won’t take up a bill that renews the lower rates for 98 percent of taxpayers.

But policy experts are engaged in a tax conversation that may be more important—how to make the tax system simpler and smarter .
Currently , terms to describe the current code are more like “ complicated , ” “ obscure , ” and even “ unconscionable , ” all of which have appeared in reports by tax policy groups looking at how to fix the system . The cost of navigating this maze to taxpayers and businesses hit $ 163 billion in 2010 , more than 1 percent of GDP . It ’ s gotten so bad that small and mid-sized companies have started passing up tax breaks they ’ re eligible for because they ’ re too confusing and costly to take , according to a report last summer in the Wall Street Journal .
Despite the agreement on the need to clean up the tax system , almost every tax law has a constituency that will fight hard to keep it . Intuit , the maker of TurboTax , has spent some $ 11.5 million lobbying to keep the tax filing process complicated for taxpayers , according to a recent report by ProPublica and NPR .
To measure the effectiveness of each tax law , experts have devised several criteria . The U.S. Government Accountability Office , for example , has three measures : ( 1 ) a tax law ’ s fairness , ( 2 ) the extent to which it promotes economic efficiency ( that is , provides more economic benefits to society than the private sector would provide on its own ) , and ( 3 ) the degree to which it ’ s simple , transparent , and easy to administer by the IRS .
Here are ten tax laws that could stand to be revised—or eliminated all together :
1 . The AMT boondoggle : Congress passed the AMT in 1982 to ensure that the well-off pay at least some tax each year . But a report earlier this year from the National Taxpayer Advocate , the watchdog arm of the IRS , says that the AMT doesn ’ t achieve that goal at all -- many middle- and upper-middle-class taxpayers pay the AMT , while most wealthy taxpayers don ’ t . And thousands of millionaires pay no income tax at all . Meanwhile , the AMT makes calculating what you owe the government far more complex than it used to be since taxpayers essentially have to compute their tax liabilities twice—once under the regular tax rules and again under the AMT , says the report . Congress at least permanently indexed the AMT for inflation in passing the fiscal cliff deal on January 3 . But that doesn ’ t make it a better tax—it just limits the number of those in the middle class whom the AMT hits .
2 . The pro sports subsidy : Current tax law allows the National Football League , Professional Golfers ’ Association , and National Hockey League to operate as nonprofits . You read right—the NFL , which generated $ 184 million from its teams and held more than $ 1 billion in assets in 2010 , pays no federal income tax . According to Waste Book 2012 , an annual report by Republican Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma , the NFL gets its tax-free status under a provision of the code that allows industry and trade groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to qualify . Cost to the taxpayers ? At least $ 91 million a year just for the NFL and NHL , according to the Waste Book .
3 . Byzantine tax phase-outs : If our tax returns are needlessly complicated , one reason is the use of phase-outs , says the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center . These are tax exemptions and credits that get limited as a taxpayer ’ s income rises , with the goal of providing more help to people at lower incomes . But they make figuring out what effect an extra dollar of income will have on the taxes you owe almost impossible . The center notes , for example , that the tax code reduces the $ 1,000-per-child tax credit by 5 percent of adjusted gross income over $ 75,000 for single parents . The share of expenses allowed for the child care credit falls from 35 percent to 20 percent as adjusted gross increases from $ 15,000 to $ 43,000 . And single taxpayers with an adjusted gross above $ 55,000 may not deduct the interest they pay on student loans . For a more progressive tax structure , the National Taxpayer Advocate recommends further adjusting the marginal tax rates—and killing the phase-outs .
4 . The high-tech loophole : The Government Accountability Office notes that there ’ s a legitimate place for governments to subsidize research that benefits society but doesn ’ t turn a profit . But there ’ s no reason for companies to get a subsidy for research and development that they would have done anyway , says the GAO . That ’ s exactly what happens now—companies like Microsoft , Boeing , and Harley Davidson have taken the research and development tax credit and written off the cost of designing profitable new technologies , products , and processes , notes tax watchdog Taxpayers for Common Sense.http : //doeren.com/blog/tag/research-and-development-tax-credits/
5 . The convoluted capital gains tax : The Tax Policy Center notes capital gains income is subject to at least eight different effective tax rates , depending on the taxpayer ’ s regular tax rate , how long an asset was owned , the type of asset , and whether the taxpayer owes AMT— one of the three IRS worksheets used to calculate the tax runs to 37 lines . It ’ s gotten even more complex in 2013 with a new 3.8 percent Medicare surtax rate starting on those with an adjusted gross income of $ 200,000 single or $ 250,000 married . The center favors cutting the thicket of paperwork by allowing a percentage exclusion of capital gains income for long-term gains ( to encourage savings ) and applying regular tax rates to the rest .
6 . Special treatment for Hollywood : At a time when movie studios Time Warner and News Corp. both recorded 2012 profits of about $ 1.2 billion , it might seem odd that they need a special favor in the tax code . But they got one anyway—as part of the fiscal cliff deal , Congress and the White House renewed special expensing rules for film and TV production . Under that provision , filmmakers and TV studios have the option of immediately deducting ( as opposed to writing off over the normal 15 to 39 years ) up to $ 15 million in program production costs as long as 75 percent of the costs are for services performed in the U.S. That may have started out as an effort to keep film and television production at home , but now it amounts to a tax subsidy to Hollywood worth $ 225 million a year , according to Taxpayers for Common Sense .
7 . Tangled education savings subsidies : At least 11 separate incentives in the code encourage taxpayers to save for higher education , according to the National Taxpayer Advocate ’ s report . All have different eligibility requirements , definitions of terms , income thresholds , and other features . In Congressional testimony last summer , the GAO noted that in 2008 ( the latest year data were available ) some taxpayers didn ’ t take the higher education deductions they were eligible for because of their complexity . The Taxpayer Advocate report recommends consolidating the incentives and harmonizing definitions to make it easier for taxpayers to determine eligibility and calculate benefits .
8 . The home price inflation incentive : The mortgage interest deduction allows homeowners to deduct interest on up to $ 1.1 million in mortgage debt . Though the deduction ’ s rationale is encouraging homeownership , in a report last fall , the GAO noted that it ’ s more likely prospective buyers are figuring the deduction into the prices they ’ re already willing to pay for homes , pushing their costs up artificially , says the agency . Many economists and the Simpson Bowles Commission have proposed at least modifying the interest deduction so that it benefits middle- to lower-income taxpayers , who are those most likely to actually need help buying a home . The Congressional Budget Office , for example , has proposed a number of options , including converting the deduction to a tax credit and lowering the current $ 1.1 million cap to $ 500,000 .
9 . Overlapping retirement savings tax incentives : Sixteen separate incentives are jammed into the code to encourage taxpayers to save for retirement , notes the National Taxpayer Advocate ’ s report . All have different rules about eligibility , contribution limits , the taxation of contributions and distributions , and so forth . So for example , a single taxpayer earning under $ 28,750 can get both a tax deduction and a tax credit for an IRA contribution—the regular IRA deduction , plus a tax credit called the Saver ’ s Credit , worth up to $ 1,000 . But a 2012 survey found that less than 20 percent of people had heard of the Saver ’ s Credit—little wonder with so many choices to keep track of . The Tax Policy Center recommends combining the existing options into fewer alternatives—that would make workers ’ choices easier and cut the cost of administering so many duplicative rules , the center says .
10 . Gimmicky tax sunsets : Congress increasingly passes tax subsidies that are time limited to make their long-term costs to the government look artificially lower , says the National Taxpayer Advocate ’ s report—the number of these sunsetting subsidies grew from about 21 in 1992 to more than a hundred at the end of 2011 . But they make it hard for taxpayers and businesses to plan since its often unclear whether Congress will extend them . Dozens were set to expire before the fiscal cliff deal at the end of 2012 , like the numerous energy-related incentives and a deduction for school expenses teachers pay out of pocket .","If you watch the budget battles in Washington, it might appear the only discussion about taxes is whether they should be increased, cut, or kept where they are. But policy experts are engaged in a tax conversation that may be more important—how to make the tax system simpler and smarter.

Currently, terms to describe the current code are more like “complicated,” “obscure,” and even “unconscionable,” all of which have appeared in reports by tax policy groups looking at how to fix the system. The cost of navigating this maze to taxpayers and businesses hit $163 billion in 2010, more than 1 percent of GDP. It’s gotten so bad that small and mid-sized companies have started passing up tax breaks they’re eligible for because they’re too confusing and costly to take, according to a report last summer in the Wall Street Journal.

Intuit, the maker of TurboTax, has spent some $11.5 million lobbying to keep the tax filing process complicated for taxpayers, according to a recent report by ProPublica and NPR.

To measure the effectiveness of each tax law, experts have devised several criteria. The U.S. Government Accountability Office, for example, has three measures: (1) a tax law’s fairness, (2) the extent to which it promotes economic efficiency (that is, provides more economic benefits to society than the private sector would provide on its own), and (3) the degree to which it’s simple, transparent, and easy to administer by the IRS.

Here are ten tax laws that could stand to be revised—or eliminated all together:

1. The AMT boondoggle: Congress passed the AMT in 1982 to ensure that the well-off pay at least some tax each year. But a report earlier this year from the National Taxpayer Advocate, the watchdog arm of the IRS, says that the AMT doesn’t achieve that goal at all--many middle- and upper-middle-class taxpayers pay the AMT, while most wealthy taxpayers don’t. And thousands of millionaires pay no income tax at all. Meanwhile, the AMT makes calculating what you owe the government far more complex than it used to be since taxpayers essentially have to compute their tax liabilities twice—once under the regular tax rules and again under the AMT, says the report. Congress at least permanently indexed the AMT for inflation in passing the fiscal cliff deal on January 3. But that doesn’t make it a better tax—it just limits the number of those in the middle class whom the AMT hits.

2. The pro sports subsidy: Current tax law allows the National Football League, Professional Golfers’ Association, and National Hockey League to operate as nonprofits. You read right—the NFL, which generated $184 million from its teams and held more than $1 billion in assets in 2010, pays no federal income tax. According to Waste Book 2012, an annual report by Republican Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, the NFL gets its tax-free status under a provision of the code that allows industry and trade groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to qualify. Cost to the taxpayers? At least $91 million a year just for the NFL and NHL, according to the Waste Book.

3. Byzantine tax phase-outs: If our tax returns are needlessly complicated, one reason is the use of phase-outs, says the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. These are tax exemptions and credits that get limited as a taxpayer’s income rises, with the goal of providing more help to people at lower incomes. But they make figuring out what effect an extra dollar of income will have on the taxes you owe almost impossible. The center notes, for example, that the tax code reduces the $1,000-per-child tax credit by 5 percent of adjusted gross income over $75,000 for single parents. The share of expenses allowed for the child care credit falls from 35 percent to 20 percent as adjusted gross increases from $15,000 to $43,000. And single taxpayers with an adjusted gross above $55,000 may not deduct the interest they pay on student loans. For a more progressive tax structure, the National Taxpayer Advocate recommends further adjusting the marginal tax rates—and killing the phase-outs.

4. The high-tech loophole: The Government Accountability Office notes that there’s a legitimate place for governments to subsidize research that benefits society but doesn’t turn a profit. But there’s no reason for companies to get a subsidy for research and development that they would have done anyway, says the GAO. That’s exactly what happens now—companies like Microsoft, Boeing, and Harley Davidson have taken the research and development tax credit and written off the cost of designing profitable new technologies, products, and processes, notes tax watchdog Taxpayers for Common Sense.http://doeren.com/blog/tag/research-and-development-tax-credits/

5. The convoluted capital gains tax: The Tax Policy Center notes capital gains income is subject to at least eight different effective tax rates, depending on the taxpayer’s regular tax rate, how long an asset was owned, the type of asset, and whether the taxpayer owes AMT— one of the three IRS worksheets used to calculate the tax runs to 37 lines. It’s gotten even more complex in 2013 with a new 3.8 percent Medicare surtax rate starting on those with an adjusted gross income of $200,000 single or $250,000 married. The center favors cutting the thicket of paperwork by allowing a percentage exclusion of capital gains income for long-term gains (to encourage savings) and applying regular tax rates to the rest.

6. Special treatment for Hollywood: At a time when movie studios Time Warner and News Corp. both recorded 2012 profits of about $1.2 billion, it might seem odd that they need a special favor in the tax code. But they got one anyway—as part of the fiscal cliff deal, Congress and the White House renewed special expensing rules for film and TV production. Under that provision, filmmakers and TV studios have the option of immediately deducting (as opposed to writing off over the normal 15 to 39 years) up to $15 million in program production costs as long as 75 percent of the costs are for services performed in the U.S. That may have started out as an effort to keep film and television production at home, but now it amounts to a tax subsidy to Hollywood worth $225 million a year, according to Taxpayers for Common Sense.

7. Tangled education savings subsidies: At least 11 separate incentives in the code encourage taxpayers to save for higher education, according to the National Taxpayer Advocate’s report. All have different eligibility requirements, definitions of terms, income thresholds, and other features. In Congressional testimony last summer, the GAO noted that in 2008 (the latest year data were available) some taxpayers didn’t take the higher education deductions they were eligible for because of their complexity. The Taxpayer Advocate report recommends consolidating the incentives and harmonizing definitions to make it easier for taxpayers to determine eligibility and calculate benefits.

8. The home price inflation incentive: The mortgage interest deduction allows homeowners to deduct interest on up to $1.1 million in mortgage debt. Though the deduction’s rationale is encouraging homeownership, in a report last fall, the GAO noted that it’s more likely prospective buyers are figuring the deduction into the prices they’re already willing to pay for homes, pushing their costs up artificially, says the agency. Many economists and the Simpson Bowles Commission have proposed at least modifying the interest deduction so that it benefits middle- to lower-income taxpayers, who are those most likely to actually need help buying a home. The Congressional Budget Office, for example, has proposed a number of options, including converting the deduction to a tax credit and lowering the current $1.1 million cap to $500,000.

9. Overlapping retirement savings tax incentives: Sixteen separate incentives are jammed into the code to encourage taxpayers to save for retirement, notes the National Taxpayer Advocate’s report. All have different rules about eligibility, contribution limits, the taxation of contributions and distributions, and so forth. So for example, a single taxpayer earning under $28,750 can get both a tax deduction and a tax credit for an IRA contribution—the regular IRA deduction, plus a tax credit called the Saver’s Credit, worth up to $1,000. But a 2012 survey found that less than 20 percent of people had heard of the Saver’s Credit—little wonder with so many choices to keep track of. The Tax Policy Center recommends combining the existing options into fewer alternatives—that would make workers’ choices easier and cut the cost of administering so many duplicative rules, the center says.

10. Gimmicky tax sunsets: Congress increasingly passes tax subsidies that are time limited to make their long-term costs to the government look artificially lower, says the National Taxpayer Advocate’s report—the number of these sunsetting subsidies grew from about 21 in 1992 to more than a hundred at the end of 2011. But they make it hard for taxpayers and businesses to plan since its often unclear whether Congress will extend them. Dozens were set to expire before the fiscal cliff deal at the end of 2012, like the numerous energy-related incentives and a deduction for school expenses teachers pay out of pocket.",www.thefiscaltimes.com,right,ebDoaOLBYgAR9Q7h

In order to make up for the tax cuts , Romney said he would `` limit deductions and exemptions '' although he has not specified which loopholes he would close or how he would amend the tax code so that more people pay income taxes . Only 47 percent of Americans paid income taxes in 2010 .
But because Romney 's proposed tax cuts are so large , according to the study , he would have to slice 65 percent of all the loopholes and deductions that are feasible to cut , such as the mortgage interest deduction , child credit , deductions for charitable contributions and exclusions for employer-provided health insurance .

`` The purpose of that paper was to scale back people 's expectations for what could actually be reduced in a tax reform , '' Looney continued , `` to establish what 's really feasible and what 's on the table . ''
Romney disagreed with this analysis , telling reporters outside his event in Nevada Friday that if his plan was assessed `` properly '' it would not `` in any way '' raise taxes on the middle class .
`` I want to limit deductions and exemptions for high income people , but high income people , when you finish going through my plan , and we score it properly , I will not have a plan that lowers the share paid by high income folks or that in any way raises taxes on middle income Americans , '' Romney said .
Under Romney 's plan , the Tax Policy Center estimates that high-income earners would get the largest tax cut . A family that makes between $ 200,000 and $ 500,000 would pay about 6 percent less per year under his plan while families earning between $ 50,000 and $ 75,000 would get a 2 percent cut .
The cuts for high-income earners are so large that eliminating every feasible tax deduction and loophole and exemption for people making more than $ 200,000 would not pay for tax cuts they would receive , the study finds . So among people who earn more than $ 200,000 per year , it would not be possible to pay for Romney 's proposed tax cuts by reducing the exemptions and deductions that group receives .
`` Turns out there are not enough of those tax breaks that benefit high income taxpayers to make it rev neutral just within that group , '' Looney said . `` That 's not a judgment , it 's a mathematical fact of life . ''
So in order to make sure his plan would not add to the deficit , Romney would have to pay for $ 86 billion worth of high-income tax cuts by cutting deductions that benefit middle- and low-income earners , according the Tax Policy Center study .
If his plan is to be revenue neutral , as Romney has said it would be , the study shows he would have to raise taxes on 95 percent of Americans - families earning less than $ 200,000 - by an average of $ 500 per year . Millionaires will still get an $ 87,000 tax cut .
`` They [ tax plans like Romney 's ] seem to be discussed in a way that I 'm going to have really big cuts in tax rates , but the tax system is going to be just as progressive as it was before , that the impact on tax revenue or on the budget is going to be the same and I 'm going to maintain all of your treasured deductions , '' Looney said . `` At some point , the math just does n't add up .
In order to avoid such middle-class tax hikes , Looney said , Romney has three options : change the plan he has already laid out so it does not give such large tax breaks to the wealthy , drop the revenue-neutral requirement so that the tax cuts are not offset with revenue increases but instead add to the deficit , or make up for the lost revenue from his tax cuts by slashing spending .
Romney 's campaign has argued that his plan to cut tax rates would spur economic growth . And as the economy grows , allowing more people pay more taxes , his plan would be virtually paid for by those increased revenues .
Looney said the Tax Policy Center ran its study again using the economic-growth scenario laid out by Romney 's economic advisers that estimates his plan would add 12 million jobs and increase GDP growth by 1 percent , which Looney said was `` an implausibly large estimate . ''
Romney 's proposed economic growth would offset 15 percent of the tax cuts , but would still leave the GOP candidate with $ 307 billion less in revenues .
`` Even in that case , there 's still a shift in the tax burden from high-income taxpayers to low -and or middle-income taxpayers , '' Looney said . `` It 's smaller , but it would require a net tax increase on the middle class . ''","Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

taxes,Politico,0,https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/09/house-republicans-tax-bill-trump-midterms-811255,At-risk House Republicans say no to new tax bill,2018-09-09,"Nancy Cook, Bernie Becker, Rachael Bade","The White House and top congressional Republicans want to push for a House vote on a second round of tax cuts ahead of the midterms in hopes of bolstering their economic pitch to voters — but they ’ re running into opposition within their own party .
GOP leaders conceived of the second tax bill as a messaging win that would put Democrats on their heels ahead of the midterms , forcing them to vote against tax relief for the middle class . But the concerns over the bill are largely flowing from the Republican side , mainly from members fighting to keep hold of seats in suburban districts where President Donald Trump is most unpopular — and that are key to the GOP ’ s hopes of keeping their majority .
A dozen House Republicans , all but one of them from the high-tax states of California , New Jersey and New York , voted against the tax law in December because it capped state and local tax deductions , which they said would lead to tax increases on too many of their constituents .
Some of those GOP lawmakers have openly said they would prefer to leave the tax issue alone as Congress also grapples with how to fund the government and the House potentially votes on health care measures that might be more politically beneficial to vulnerable incumbents . “ If we were to pass that here in the House , it would be an exercise in futility , because it could never pass in the Senate , ” Rep. Leonard Lance of New Jersey , who opposed the first bill , said Friday on CNBC .
Top House leaders will unveil the second tax overhaul bill this week . Drafted by House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady ( R-Texas ) , the bill proposes to make permanent individual tax rate cuts from the Republicans ’ first tax bill , while introducing new measures intended to help families save money , especially for retirement , and to spur innovation for businesses .

House leaders and White House officials hope it can at least pass through that chamber before the election . The Senate is not expected to take up the bill in 2018 given the focus on speeding through judicial nominations and a Supreme Court confirmation — and because Majority Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) simply does not have the votes to pass a second tax bill .
Republican leaders “ certainly directed us from the get-go to be ready to move this in September , ” Brady told reporters last week . “ It ’ s full steam ahead . ”
GOP officials have long acknowledged that they couldn ’ t pack all of their priorities into a measure that eventually become last year ’ s $ 1.5 trillion tax cut , because no Democrats supported the bill . They passed it with a slim margin of votes using a budgetary measure called reconciliation , which required only a simple majority in the Senate , and have long wanted to revisit the bill ’ s tweaks to the individual side of the tax code . Those changes are scheduled to expire after 2025 , while the corporate tax changes became permanent under the new law .
This time , the White House and Treasury Department largely have taken a back seat in drafting the bill , though Brady , President Donald Trump , and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have remained in close touch as the bill progressed . Ways and Means lawmakers also visited the White House in July to discuss the bill , and the committee is expected to mark up the new measure on Thursday after releasing legislative text early this week .
The White House ’ s main concern is that the individual tax cuts are made permanent , said one Republican close to the White House , calling the other proposals more “ nickel-and-dime ” stuff . Mnuchin and Ivanka Trump also have visited Capitol Hill to discuss various parts of the bill , according to one administration official .
Shahira Knight , the relatively new White House director of legislative affairs , who helped write the Republicans ' first tax bill in close concert with top economic staffers and lawmakers , will help shepherd this 2.0 bill through the House , in addition to tackling the farm and multiple spending bills . Since the first tax bill passed , one of Trump ’ s top informal economic advisers , Larry Kudlow , has become director of the National Economic Council , putting into the White House a firm champion of cutting taxes to spur economic growth .
Some administration officials have expressed regret about the way the individual side of the tax code turned out under the Republican tax bill . “ The part of tax reform to me that was so important was really the corporate side , ” said Gary Cohn , the White House ’ s former top economic adviser , at a Washington event in June . “ One thing that haunts me , ” however , is that Republicans were not able to make the individual income-tax cuts permanent , he said .
Democrats have criticized the amount of stock buybacks that have followed the tax law and maintain the law has done little to help the average worker , and they are likely to pound those themes again when discussing the second bill .
Democrats might have run from that fight in the past , given how often Republicans label them tax hikers . But these days , they are more than happy to relitigate last year ’ s tax law , which they have insisted from the start would heap savings onto corporations and the wealthy while leaving behind the middle class .
The more even ground on taxes shows up in polling , too . The new tax law has not been the political plus that many Republicans expected as they try to hold on to the House , only becoming less popular since the beginning of the year .
The House Republican preview of the new bill also floated a range of new tools for families to increase savings , including creating a new Universal Savings Account and making it easier to contribute to Individual Retirement Accounts .
Lawmakers and aides in both parties say it ’ s possible that retirement provisions could pass as part of a year-end tax deal after the election .

The White House and top congressional Republicans want to push for a House vote on a second round of tax cuts ahead of the midterms in hopes of bolstering their economic pitch to voters — but they’re running into opposition within their own party.

GOP leaders conceived of the second tax bill as a messaging win that would put Democrats on their heels ahead of the midterms, forcing them to vote against tax relief for the middle class. But the concerns over the bill are largely flowing from the Republican side, mainly from members fighting to keep hold of seats in suburban districts where President Donald Trump is most unpopular — and that are key to the GOP’s hopes of keeping their majority.

A dozen House Republicans, all but one of them from the high-tax states of California, New Jersey and New York, voted against the tax law in December because it capped state and local tax deductions, which they said would lead to tax increases on too many of their constituents.

Some of those GOP lawmakers have openly said they would prefer to leave the tax issue alone as Congress also grapples with how to fund the government and the House potentially votes on health care measures that might be more politically beneficial to vulnerable incumbents. “If we were to pass that here in the House, it would be an exercise in futility, because it could never pass in the Senate,” Rep. Leonard Lance of New Jersey, who opposed the first bill, said Friday on CNBC.

Top House leaders will unveil the second tax overhaul bill this week. Drafted by House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas), the bill proposes to make permanent individual tax rate cuts from the Republicans’ first tax bill, while introducing new measures intended to help families save money, especially for retirement, and to spur innovation for businesses.

House leaders and White House officials hope it can at least pass through that chamber before the election. The Senate is not expected to take up the bill in 2018 given the focus on speeding through judicial nominations and a Supreme Court confirmation — and because Majority Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) simply does not have the votes to pass a second tax bill.

Republican leaders “certainly directed us from the get-go to be ready to move this in September,” Brady told reporters last week. “It’s full steam ahead.”

GOP officials have long acknowledged that they couldn’t pack all of their priorities into a measure that eventually become last year’s $1.5 trillion tax cut, because no Democrats supported the bill. They passed it with a slim margin of votes using a budgetary measure called reconciliation, which required only a simple majority in the Senate, and have long wanted to revisit the bill’s tweaks to the individual side of the tax code. Those changes are scheduled to expire after 2025, while the corporate tax changes became permanent under the new law.

This time, the White House and Treasury Department largely have taken a back seat in drafting the bill, though Brady, President Donald Trump, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have remained in close touch as the bill progressed. Ways and Means lawmakers also visited the White House in July to discuss the bill, and the committee is expected to mark up the new measure on Thursday after releasing legislative text early this week.

The White House’s main concern is that the individual tax cuts are made permanent, said one Republican close to the White House, calling the other proposals more “nickel-and-dime” stuff. Mnuchin and Ivanka Trump also have visited Capitol Hill to discuss various parts of the bill, according to one administration official.

Shahira Knight, the relatively new White House director of legislative affairs, who helped write the Republicans' first tax bill in close concert with top economic staffers and lawmakers, will help shepherd this 2.0 bill through the House, in addition to tackling the farm and multiple spending bills. Since the first tax bill passed, one of Trump’s top informal economic advisers, Larry Kudlow, has become director of the National Economic Council, putting into the White House a firm champion of cutting taxes to spur economic growth.

Some administration officials have expressed regret about the way the individual side of the tax code turned out under the Republican tax bill. “The part of tax reform to me that was so important was really the corporate side,” said Gary Cohn, the White House’s former top economic adviser, at a Washington event in June. “One thing that haunts me,” however, is that Republicans were not able to make the individual income-tax cuts permanent, he said.

Democrats have criticized the amount of stock buybacks that have followed the tax law and maintain the law has done little to help the average worker, and they are likely to pound those themes again when discussing the second bill.

Democrats might have run from that fight in the past, given how often Republicans label them tax hikers. But these days, they are more than happy to relitigate last year’s tax law, which they have insisted from the start would heap savings onto corporations and the wealthy while leaving behind the middle class.

The more even ground on taxes shows up in polling, too. The new tax law has not been the political plus that many Republicans expected as they try to hold on to the House, only becoming less popular since the beginning of the year.

The House Republican preview of the new bill also floated a range of new tools for families to increase savings, including creating a new Universal Savings Account and making it easier to contribute to Individual Retirement Accounts.

Lawmakers and aides in both parties say it’s possible that retirement provisions could pass as part of a year-end tax deal after the election. Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the panel’s top Democrat, previously have teamed up on bipartisan retirement savings legislation.

“My feeling is that it’s fine. It is certainly smart to make the tax cuts permanent, but it is not urgent, because those don’t expire for many years,” said Stephen Moore, a distinguished visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation and informal economic adviser to Trump’s 2016 campaign. “I would still support the bill because it is probably a good thing for Republicans to always be on the offensive on cutting taxes.”

At the marathon Senate Budget Committee hearing this week , Sen. Bob Corker , R-Tenn. , strolled in like a man who had just quit his job and was ready to tell the boss what he really thinks .
`` I have difficulty putting that much energy into discussing this budget document because this is some of the most meaningless work that we do here , '' Corker said with a sigh . `` It has nothing to do with the chairman or the committee . It 's a waste of time . ''
Corker announced last week that he plans to retire at the end of this Congress . He has never been slow to voice his opinions — even ones that go against the party line — but he seems to be speaking even more freely since he announced he wo n't run for re-election .
`` I mean , I still want to be myself here . I do n't want to all of sudden , I 'm leaving and I act differently , '' Corker told reporters when asked about the apparent uptick in his candor on Capitol Hill. `` 'Do you feel a little bit more [ free ] ? ' I do n't know , maybe . ''
Corker drew a lot of attention this week with his critical comments about the `` chaos '' in the Trump administration on foreign policy and tensions inside the State Department .
But Republicans concerned about the party 's scorecard for legislative victories this year should be more focused on Corker 's fresh warning signals that he is not fully on board for the GOP 's early outline of tax legislation .
At committee hearings , to party leaders , at private Senate lunch meetings and to the media this week , Corker has laid bare his concerns about a tax bill that threatens to add to the federal budget deficit .
`` Unless it reduces deficits — let me say that one more time — unless it reduces deficits and does not add to deficits with reasonable and responsible growth models , and unless we can make it permanent , I do n't have any interest in it , '' Corker said at the Budget Committee hearing .
Republicans have outlined the framework for their tax bill that aims to reduce the corporate and individual tax rate , collapse individual tax brackets from seven to three and eliminate certain deductions to help pay for it .
The questions that Corker raises — whether it will add to the deficit , how much economic growth it will produce and whether the changes will expire or be made permanent — have not yet been answered .
Republicans first need to pass a budget resolution , the annual political exercise Corker derided as a `` waste of time '' at this week 's hearing because of the hours of theatrics required to pass a resolution along a predictable party-line vote .
The resolution , once approved by both chambers , will pave the way for Senate Republicans to pass tax legislation that only requires 50 votes . It is that same process Republicans used to try to pass health care legislation without needing any Democrats .
Just like on health care , Republicans can only lose two votes and still pass a tax bill if no Democrats support it . That is why securing Corker 's vote is critical .
Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden , D-Ore. , who also sits on the Budget Committee , was there for Corker 's remarks this week . He says Republicans risk defeat because they are employing the same tactics they used on health care to try to get a tax bill passed .
`` Let 's put it this way : In the health care bill , a number of senators just point blank said this kind of [ bill ] — where you 're just to drive it through on a partisan basis , where you do n't have any [ Congressional Budget Office ] score , where you have really fanciful notions with respect to the revenue and the like — a bunch of them said , 'Nothing doing , ' and the bill went down , '' Wyden said , in reference to Sens . John McCain of Arizona and Susan Collins of Maine , who were decisive `` no '' votes on health care .
`` Now usually you learn from something that turned out to be a debacle , but as of now , they seem inclined to go down the same path , '' Wyden said .
Senate Republicans believe that they will write a tax bill Corker can support .
`` I think Sen. Corker is one of the brightest guys in the entire conference . I think he is sincere in his concerns . I 'd much rather have him expressing that now than in the last few days before a vote , '' said Sen. Mike Rounds , R-S.D. , `` He adds value , and he will make our product better . ''
Most Republicans freely admit that the political pressure has only ratcheted up to pass a tax bill after the party 's failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act . Corker is notably not one of them . `` Some people may be feeling we have to do tax reform , even if we do the wrong kind of tax reform , just to deliver , '' he said , `` This is about substance to me ; it 's not about politics . ''
The substance on the deficit is this : In the most recent four fiscal years , the federal government spent roughly between $ 400 billion and $ 600 billion more than it took in every year . In September , the U.S. national debt crossed a staggering $ 20 trillion mark for the first time .
`` It 's really disheartening to watch how many people are putting the debt second to their desire for big tax cuts when what we need to do is reform the tax code , '' said Maya MacGuineas , who runs the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget , a fiscal watchdog group . `` If we have a tax cut right now at a time when the economy does n't need stimulus and our debt is at near record levels , that will do a lot of damage for the economy and it will be a huge missed opportunity . ''
For deficit hawks like Corker , it is unconscionable to vote for tax cuts if they believe it means more deficits and more debt . `` This is the most passionate thing for me , period , that I work on . Not foreign policy , not banking . It 's this deficit issue , '' said Corker , who is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . `` And through the years , especially after Election Day , I 've just seen it 's like party time up here . Nobody cares about deficits anymore . ''
Republicans who loudly criticized the Obama administration for deficit spending are more muted now that the GOP is in control . One of the most prominent ones is Budget Director Mick Mulvaney , who was a vocal deficit hawk when he served in Congress but this week said `` new deficits '' could be necessary to achieve higher rates of economic growth .
`` If we simply look at this as being deficit-neutral , you 're never going to get the type of tax reform and tax reductions that you need to get to sustain 3 percent economic growth , '' he told Fox News Sunday .
That argument is unlikely to win over Republicans like Corker , who repeated this week that he views the deficit as the biggest threat to the nation .
`` I 'm doing what I can hopefully in a nice way to try and steer us back to the fact that deficits matter . They 're a greater threat to us than North Korea or [ the Islamic State ] , '' he said .

taxes,CBS News,0,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gop-tax-overhaul-fact-checking-lopsided-political-arguments/,GOP Tax Bill Fact-Check: How both sides are stretching the truth,,,"WASHINGTON — You would n't know it from President Donald Trump 's rhetoric , but the tax overhaul coming into effect is heavily tilted to the rich . It also leaves `` Obamacare '' in place , despite his assertion that the tax plan repeals the health care law . Nothing about the plan provides the fuel to achieve economic growth at the levels he 's predicted .
Trump 's penchant for exaggeration and sometimes pure fiction has clouded the realities of the overhaul as it has shaped up over months . As for Democrats , you would n't know to hear them talk that middle-class people are getting a tax cut out of the deal , too .
A look at remarks made Wednesday and earlier about the tax plan Trump will shortly sign into law .
PRES . TRUMP : `` It 's the largest tax cut in the history of our country . '' — remarks Wednesday .
THE FACTS : It is n't . For months Trump has refused to recognize larger tax cuts in history , of which there have been many , or to grant that other presidents have enacted big tax cuts since Ronald Reagan in the 1980s .
An October analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that it would be the eighth biggest since 1918 . As a percentage of the total economy , Reagan 's 1981 cut is the biggest followed by the 1945 rollback of taxes that financed World War II . Trump 's plan is also smaller than cuts in 1948 , 1964 and 1921 , and probably in other years .
Valued at $ 1.5 trillion over 10 years , the plan is indeed large and expensive . But it 's much smaller than originally intended . Back in the spring , it was shaping up as a $ 5.5 trillion package . Even then it would have only been the third largest since 1940 as a share of gross domestic product .
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE : `` You 're delivering on that middle-class miracle . '' — to Trump at a Cabinet meeting Wednesday .
THE FACTS : Modest does n't make for a miracle . Pence 's praise to the boss reflects Trump 's assertion that `` it 's a tax bill for the middle class , '' as he put it earlier and many times , but average people are not the prime beneficiaries of the tax cuts . Aside from businesses , rich people get the most .
The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates the biggest benefit of the new law will go to households making $ 308,000 to $ 733,000 . Households making over that should get a tax cut worth 3.4 percent of their after-tax income . For the richest 0.1 percent ( making over $ 3.4 million ) , the tax cut should be worth 2.7 percent of their after-tax income . For middle-income earners : 1.6 percent , the center estimates .
Moreover , only high-income people would get a meaningful tax cut after 2025 , when nearly all of the plan 's individual income tax provisions are due to expire .
Republicans argue that the middle class will also see benefits from the business tax cuts , in the form of more jobs and higher wages .
DEMOCRATIC SEN. CHARLES SCHUMER : `` Their bill increases taxes on lots of middle-class people . ... According to the Tax Policy Center , the top one percent of earners in our country gets 83 percent of the benefits . '' — remarks Tuesday .
THE FACTS : The tax cuts are not nearly as lopsided as many Democrats are portraying them . Almost all of the middle class would initially pay less in taxes .
For the next eight years , the vast majority of middle-class taxpayers — those earning between $ 49,000 and $ 86,000 — will receive a tax cut , albeit a small one . In 2018 , nine-tenths of the middle class will get a cut , according to the Tax Policy Center . In 2025 , 87 percent will . The tax cut wo n't be very big : just $ 930 next year for the middle one-fifth of taxpayers , the center 's analysis concludes . For those paid twice a month , that 's about $ 40 a paycheck .
Schumer and other Democrats are basing their assertions on the fact that nearly all personal tax cuts expire after 2025 , which would result in a slight tax increase for about two-thirds of the middle class by 2027 . The top 1 percent would still get a cut that year .
Only in 2027 do the wealthiest taxpayers get 83 percent of the benefit , as Schumer says . In 2018 , roughly 21 percent of the tax cut 's benefits go to the richest 1 percent , a much smaller figure , though still a disproportionate share . Just 11 percent will go to the middle one-fifth .
REP. NANCY PELOSI , House Democratic leader : `` 86 million middle class families get a tax hike . '' — tweet Wednesday .
THE FACTS : She 's ignoring all the middle class tax cuts before 2027 ; that year , taxes will be slightly higher for the middle class unless the cuts are extended .
PRES . TRUMP on his tax legislation : `` Obamacare has been repealed in this bill . '' — remarks Wednesday .
THE FACTS : It has n't . The tax plan ends fines for people who do n't carry health insurance . That 's a major change but far from the dismantling of the law .
Other marquee components of Obama 's law remain , such as the Medicaid expansion serving low-income adults , protections that shield people with pre-existing medical conditions from being denied coverage or charged higher premiums , income-based subsidies for consumers buying individual health insurance policies , the requirement that insurers cover `` essential '' health benefits , and the mandate that larger employers provide coverage to their workers or face fines .
Also , the tax bill does n't repeal fines for uninsured individuals until the start of 2019 , meaning the `` individual mandate '' is still in force for next year unless the administration acts to waive the penalties .
PRES . TRUMP : `` When the individual mandate is being repealed , that means Obamacare is being repealed because they get their money from the individual mandate . '' — remarks Wednesday .
THE FACTS : This is also wrong . The fines on people who do n't carry health insurance only provide a small fraction of the financing for the program . Most of the money comes from higher taxes on upper-income people , cuts in Medicare payments to service providers , and other tax increases .
The Congressional Budget Office estimated that fines from uninsured people would total $ 3 billion this year , while the government 's cost for the coverage provided under the health law would total about $ 117 billion .
PRES . TRUMP : `` So we 're at 3.3 percent GDP . I see no reason why we do n't go to 4 percent , 5 percent and even 6 percent . '' Speaks of GDP `` getting up to 4 , 5 , and even 6 percent , because I think that 's possible . '' — Cabinet meeting last week .
THE FACTS : There are no signs the economy is capable of delivering a phenomenal and rarely achieved growth rate in the order of 6 percent , or 5 or even 4 .

PRES . TRUMP on the tax plan : `` So there 's a great spirit for it , people want to see it . '' — Fox Business interview in October .
In an NBC-Wall Street Journal poll this week , 41 percent said the tax plan is a bad idea , 24 percent said it was good . That 's a deterioration in support over two months .
A Quinnipiac University poll this month found that registered voters , convinced that the benefits will flow mainly to corporations and the wealthy , oppose the plan 55 percent to 26 percent .
In a Gallup poll in September , just 2 percent of respondents named taxes as the country 's most important problem . Dissatisfaction with government , race relations and immigration were among the issues at the forefront .
An April survey by the Pew Research Center found that 54 percent Americans say they pay about the right amount in taxes , while 40 percent say they pay more than their fair share .
The president 's plan will cut the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent . An April Gallup poll found that two-thirds of Americans think corporations pay too little in taxes .","WASHINGTON — You wouldn't know it from President Donald Trump's rhetoric, but the tax overhaul coming into effect is heavily tilted to the rich. It also leaves ""Obamacare"" in place, despite his assertion that the tax plan repeals the health care law. Nothing about the plan provides the fuel to achieve economic growth at the levels he's predicted.

Trump's penchant for exaggeration and sometimes pure fiction has clouded the realities of the overhaul as it has shaped up over months. As for Democrats, you wouldn't know to hear them talk that middle-class people are getting a tax cut out of the deal, too.

A look at remarks made Wednesday and earlier about the tax plan Trump will shortly sign into law.

PRES. TRUMP: ""It's the largest tax cut in the history of our country."" — remarks Wednesday.

THE FACTS: It isn't. For months Trump has refused to recognize larger tax cuts in history, of which there have been many, or to grant that other presidents have enacted big tax cuts since Ronald Reagan in the 1980s.

An October analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that it would be the eighth biggest since 1918. As a percentage of the total economy, Reagan's 1981 cut is the biggest followed by the 1945 rollback of taxes that financed World War II. Trump's plan is also smaller than cuts in 1948, 1964 and 1921, and probably in other years.

Valued at $1.5 trillion over 10 years, the plan is indeed large and expensive. But it's much smaller than originally intended. Back in the spring, it was shaping up as a $5.5 trillion package. Even then it would have only been the third largest since 1940 as a share of gross domestic product.

VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: ""You're delivering on that middle-class miracle."" — to Trump at a Cabinet meeting Wednesday.

THE FACTS: Modest doesn't make for a miracle. Pence's praise to the boss reflects Trump's assertion that ""it's a tax bill for the middle class,"" as he put it earlier and many times, but average people are not the prime beneficiaries of the tax cuts. Aside from businesses, rich people get the most.

The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates the biggest benefit of the new law will go to households making $308,000 to $733,000. Households making over that should get a tax cut worth 3.4 percent of their after-tax income. For the richest 0.1 percent (making over $3.4 million), the tax cut should be worth 2.7 percent of their after-tax income. For middle-income earners: 1.6 percent, the center estimates.

Moreover, only high-income people would get a meaningful tax cut after 2025, when nearly all of the plan's individual income tax provisions are due to expire.

Republicans argue that the middle class will also see benefits from the business tax cuts, in the form of more jobs and higher wages.

DEMOCRATIC SEN. CHARLES SCHUMER: ""Their bill increases taxes on lots of middle-class people. ... According to the Tax Policy Center, the top one percent of earners in our country gets 83 percent of the benefits."" — remarks Tuesday.

THE FACTS: The tax cuts are not nearly as lopsided as many Democrats are portraying them. Almost all of the middle class would initially pay less in taxes.

For the next eight years, the vast majority of middle-class taxpayers — those earning between $49,000 and $86,000 — will receive a tax cut, albeit a small one. In 2018, nine-tenths of the middle class will get a cut, according to the Tax Policy Center. In 2025, 87 percent will. The tax cut won't be very big: just $930 next year for the middle one-fifth of taxpayers, the center's analysis concludes. For those paid twice a month, that's about $40 a paycheck.

Schumer and other Democrats are basing their assertions on the fact that nearly all personal tax cuts expire after 2025, which would result in a slight tax increase for about two-thirds of the middle class by 2027. The top 1 percent would still get a cut that year.

Only in 2027 do the wealthiest taxpayers get 83 percent of the benefit, as Schumer says. In 2018, roughly 21 percent of the tax cut's benefits go to the richest 1 percent, a much smaller figure, though still a disproportionate share. Just 11 percent will go to the middle one-fifth.

REP. NANCY PELOSI, House Democratic leader: ""86 million middle class families get a tax hike."" — tweet Wednesday.

THE FACTS: She's ignoring all the middle class tax cuts before 2027; that year, taxes will be slightly higher for the middle class unless the cuts are extended.

PRES. TRUMP on his tax legislation: ""Obamacare has been repealed in this bill."" — remarks Wednesday.

THE FACTS: It hasn't. The tax plan ends fines for people who don't carry health insurance. That's a major change but far from the dismantling of the law.

Other marquee components of Obama's law remain, such as the Medicaid expansion serving low-income adults, protections that shield people with pre-existing medical conditions from being denied coverage or charged higher premiums, income-based subsidies for consumers buying individual health insurance policies, the requirement that insurers cover ""essential"" health benefits, and the mandate that larger employers provide coverage to their workers or face fines.

Also, the tax bill doesn't repeal fines for uninsured individuals until the start of 2019, meaning the ""individual mandate"" is still in force for next year unless the administration acts to waive the penalties.

PRES. TRUMP: ""When the individual mandate is being repealed, that means Obamacare is being repealed because they get their money from the individual mandate."" — remarks Wednesday.

THE FACTS: This is also wrong. The fines on people who don't carry health insurance only provide a small fraction of the financing for the program. Most of the money comes from higher taxes on upper-income people, cuts in Medicare payments to service providers, and other tax increases.

The Congressional Budget Office estimated that fines from uninsured people would total $3 billion this year, while the government's cost for the coverage provided under the health law would total about $117 billion.

PRES. TRUMP: ""So we're at 3.3 percent GDP. I see no reason why we don't go to 4 percent, 5 percent and even 6 percent."" Speaks of GDP ""getting up to 4, 5, and even 6 percent, because I think that's possible."" — Cabinet meeting last week.

THE FACTS: There are no signs the economy is capable of delivering a phenomenal and rarely achieved growth rate in the order of 6 percent, or 5 or even 4. Federal Reserve officials and most mainstream economists expect economic growth to hew closer to 2 percent. The economy last cleared the 6 percent hurdle in 1984 and only for that fleeting year, at 7.3 percent. This was a different time, when baby boomers were at prime working ages, instead of today when they're starting to retire. The Federal Reserve had boosted growth by steadily slashing a key interest rate from its 1981 peak of 20 percent, while the Fed today is slowly increasing the same rate. Also, the national debt was much lower.

Trump's tax cuts are forecast to max out at roughly $280 billion in 2019, says Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation. Yet to generate growth of 6 percent, those cuts would have to spur a massive $1.2 trillion gain to the gross domestic product. No administration analysis emerged to show how this could be possible.

HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN: ""We are making things so simple that you can do your taxes on a form the size of a postcard."" — remarks when the tax bill came out Nov. 2.

THE FACTS: Don't count on it. Few accountants would agree that simplification has been achieved. The combination of temporary provisions, partial elimination of deductions and other loopholes, and differing tax rates for business income and wages in the new law has, if anything, added further complications.

Some middle-class taxpayers may see simpler returns because the standard deduction has doubled in size, to $24,000 for a married couple. Some families will probably stop taking deductions for things like mortgage interest as a result, making their tax returns easier to file. But people who give heavily to charity, for example, will still have to run through their receipts to see if they're better off with the standard deduction or itemization.

Many business owners and upper-income taxpayers are faced with a host of new complexities: Should high-paid employees try to reclassify their salaries as business income, which will now be subject to a lower tax rate? If so, what will they do in eight years, when the lower rate on business income is set to expire? Are they losing their deduction for state and local taxes, which can be worth tens of thousands of dollars for wealthier taxpayers? Many will, but it may not matter if they paid the alternative minimum tax in previous years, which overrode those deductions.

These types of questions will keep accountants busy for months, if not longer.

PRES. TRUMP on the tax plan: ""So there's a great spirit for it, people want to see it."" — Fox Business interview in October.

THE FACTS: Polling doesn't find that spirit.

In an NBC-Wall Street Journal poll this week, 41 percent said the tax plan is a bad idea, 24 percent said it was good. That's a deterioration in support over two months.

A Quinnipiac University poll this month found that registered voters, convinced that the benefits will flow mainly to corporations and the wealthy, oppose the plan 55 percent to 26 percent.

On this score, the verdict remains out. By all accounts, Republicans see great urgency to pass a tax bill to accomplish something in their first year in control.

That 's how much the White House figures it would take to generate $ 200,000 worth of income annually . However the problem with such an approach as investment news points out as that and in the historic low interest-rate environment it takes more money to produce $ 200,000 worth of income which is all you apparently need in retirement according to them—of course they ’ ll never live on such a pittance .
It is unclear if the administration wishes to tie the size of retirement accounts to interest rates .
Can you imagine a world where suddenly you have too much money in your retirement account according to the government because interest rates went up 1 % ?
Only in Washington DC could they come up with such a complex plan and call tax reform .
There are already limits on how much you can put into an individual retirement account 401 ( k ) and other qualified plans . What happens with that money after that has largely up to the individual -- as it should be .
Now they just want to make sure that you aren ’ t too successful as an investor .
Obama will unveil the $ 4 trillion budget proposal the heart of which includes so-called corporate tax reform . Both Republicans and Democrats recognize the need for lowering corporate tax rates to be more competitive with other countries . But what they wo n't agree to is how much those rate should be lowered .
Additionally both sides are looking to tax money held off shore by US corporations -- and again the two are divided by how much should be taxed .

According to experts that should take about another year .","Obama wants to cap your retirement.

Inside his new budget he is proposing to cap qualified retirement savings at $3 million.

That's how much the White House figures it would take to generate $200,000 worth of income annually. However the problem with such an approach as investment news points out as that and in the historic low interest-rate environment it takes more money to produce $200,000 worth of income which is all you apparently need in retirement according to them—of course they’ll never live on such a pittance.

It is unclear if the administration wishes to tie the size of retirement accounts to interest rates.

Can you imagine a world where suddenly you have too much money in your retirement account according to the government because interest rates went up 1%?

Only in Washington DC could they come up with such a complex plan and call tax reform.

There are already limits on how much you can put into an individual retirement account 401(k) and other qualified plans. What happens with that money after that has largely up to the individual-- as it should be.

Now they just want to make sure that you aren’t too successful as an investor.

Can we please stop penalizing success?

Obama will unveil the $4 trillion budget proposal the heart of which includes so-called corporate tax reform. Both Republicans and Democrats recognize the need for lowering corporate tax rates to be more competitive with other countries. But what they won't agree to is how much those rate should be lowered.

Additionally both sides are looking to tax money held off shore by US corporations--and again the two are divided by how much should be taxed.

In all it will lead to another year of uncertainty for US businesses about taxes.

Let’s make it clear GOP: We should never be thinking about taxing profits from overseas.

Besides lacking jurisdiction, the world needs more tax competition.

Consumers took advantage of holiday pricing and did their shopping early for Christmas last year. And that led to a larger than expected drop in consumer spending, the largest in fact on five years.

The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending went down 0.3 percent in December after going up by half a percent in November. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected consumer spending only to drop by 0.2 of a percent for December.

That likely means that much of the extra cash because the falling oil prices is now in the economy.

But the good news is that wages were up 0.3 of a percent in December, an annual pace that would see household incomes rise over 3.5 percent annually.

But wage inflation is the one place the Federal Reserve hates to see inflation. So congratulations America on your bigger paycheck.

Now knock it off.

If you're the parent of a special needs child-- a child with disabilities-- you will soon have a new tool to pay for qualified expenses. In the tax extenders bill signed in December 2014 there was a provision to open up 529 accounts to families with special needs children who have qualified medical expenses.

NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Democratic-leaning states are set to bankroll a big chunk of the tax cuts unveiled in a Republican tax plan on Thursday, as the plan slashes deductions used the most by residents of states that voted against Donald Trump in the 2016 elections.

The bill, introduced by the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Ways and Means on Thursday, took aim at state and local tax deductions as one part of its plan to pay for reductions in taxes elsewhere. Overall, the plan would reduce federal revenues by roughly $1.5 trillion over 10 years.

Stage One was to dispatch his treasury secretary to Capitol Hill to make a laughable offer to Republicans on the fiscal cliff — literally. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell reported that he burst out laughing upon hearing Tim Geithner spell out the White House’s terms.

Stage Two is watching Republicans squirm, squabble and panic. Less than a week after the hilarity courtesy of Geithner, The New York Times headlined a front-page piece, “GOP Looks for Fallback to Avoid a Fiscal Standoff.”

The grand budget deal that all the talking heads say we need to prove that Washington is still functional, to vindicate the memory of Ronald Reagan and Tip O’Neill, to ensure that the making of Stephen Spielberg’s “Lincoln” was not in vain, etc., etc., is almost certainly not going to come off.

For a deal to happen, one of two things must be true: The White House must either want a deal, or feel that it needs a deal. You don’t have to be a hostage negotiator or a game theorist to understand that neither is the case.

Does the White House need a deal? It considers its position so strong that it probably thinks it did McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner a favor by having Geithner show up to insult them in person. He could have done it by text message.

Obama just won an election in which pretty much his only concrete agenda item was a tax increase on the rich, although the casual listener might have thought he was only talking about taxing millionaires and billionaires. Tax increases on the rich poll well, while the Republican counterdemands — entitlement cuts — don’t.

If nothing happens, tax increases go up for everyone and all the polls show that the public is primed to blame the Republicans. That means that the president and the media will be plowing fertile ground when they paint Boehner and company as hideous extremists who hate the middle class if all rates go up at the end of the year.

taxes,Reuters,1,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-taxcuts/trump-tax-cut-plan-gains-momentum-after-u-s-budget-vote-idUSKBN1CP18W,Trump tax cut plan gains momentum after U.S. budget vote,2017-10-21,Amanda Becker,"WASHINGTON ( ███ ) - President Donald Trump ’ s tax reform plans won partial support on Friday when Republican U.S . Senator Rand Paul said he was “ all in ” for massive tax cuts , but the party was still far from united over how to achieve the main item on its domestic agenda .
Trump ’ s drive to overhaul the U.S. tax code cleared a critical hurdle on Thursday when the Senate approved a budget measure that will allow Republicans to pursue a tax-cut package without Democratic party support .
But Republicans , who control both the Senate and House of Representatives , have yet to produce a tax reform bill as a self-imposed deadline to overhaul the U.S. tax code by the end of the year approaches . The party ’ s lawmakers differ widely on what cuts to make and how to pay for them .
They are under intense pressure to succeed on tax reform after failing so far to make good on their other main legislative ambition : scrapping Obamacare , the signature healthcare law of former President Barack Obama .
On major world markets , stock prices advanced on Friday , bond yields rose , and the U.S. dollar strengthened on increased hopes that Trump could make progress on his fiscal plans .
Democrats are likely to reject the Trump administration ’ s tax plan , which promises to deliver up to $ 6 trillion in tax cuts to businesses and people but will bloat the federal deficit by $ 1.5 trillion over the next decade .
Senator Rand Paul , a fiscal hawk , was the lone Republican to vote against the budget measure on Thursday . He objected to spending levels that he said would exceed agreed caps by $ 43 billion , and called for spending reforms for so-called entitlements such as the Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programs .
On Friday , Paul said in a post on Twitter that he was “ all in ” for the “ biggest , boldest cuts possible - and soon ! ” But he did not address the specifics of the tax plan .
Trump on Friday expressed optimism about the tax reform , saying Paul would eventually back the proposed tax measure when it comes up for a vote .
“ The Budget passed late last night , 51 to 49 . We got ZERO Democrat votes with only Rand Paul ( he will vote for Tax Cuts ) voting against , ” Trump wrote on Twitter . “ This now allows for the passage of large scale Tax Cuts ( and Reform ) , which will be the biggest in the history of our country ! ”
Trump told Fox Business Network in a television interview set to air on Sunday that he thinks Republicans have the votes to pass a big tax cut package . He said he had been thinking about tying tax legislation to an infrastructure spending bill but that it was not clear a combined package would gain more votes .
“ I don ’ t want to take any chances cause I feel we have the votes right now the way it is , ” he said , according to a transcript provided by the cable news outlet .
The budget resolution passed by the Senate on Thursday has to be reconciled with a markedly different version passed by the House , where Republicans say negotiations on a unified measure could take up to two weeks .
The House budget resolution calls for a revenue-neutral tax bill and would combine tax cuts with $ 203 billion in spending cuts to mandatory programs , including food assistance for the poor .
As far as spending cuts go , the Senate version only instructs the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to save at least $ 1 billion over the next decade .
That difference could set up a possible conflict between Republicans in the Senate and House as they negotiate a final budget blueprint .
Overhauling the complex U.S. tax code has defied Washington since 1986 .
In the current effort , some Republican senators question the planned repeal of a 40 percent inheritance tax levied on estates worth more than $ 5.5 million , or $ 11 million for married couples , a tax paid only by the wealthiest American taxpayers .
Republican lawmakers from high-tax states such as New York are also seeking compromise on repealing the deduction from federal taxes for state and local tax payments .
U.S . Senator Rand Paul ( R-KY ) listens as U.S. President Donald Trump speaks before signing an executive order making it easier for Americans to buy bare-bones health insurance plans and circumvent Obamacare rules at the White House in Washington , U.S. , October 12 , 2017 . ███/Kevin Lamarque

Trump’s drive to overhaul the U.S. tax code cleared a critical hurdle on Thursday when the Senate approved a budget measure that will allow Republicans to pursue a tax-cut package without Democratic party support.

But Republicans, who control both the Senate and House of Representatives, have yet to produce a tax reform bill as a self-imposed deadline to overhaul the U.S. tax code by the end of the year approaches. The party’s lawmakers differ widely on what cuts to make and how to pay for them.

They are under intense pressure to succeed on tax reform after failing so far to make good on their other main legislative ambition: scrapping Obamacare, the signature healthcare law of former President Barack Obama.

On major world markets, stock prices advanced on Friday, bond yields rose, and the U.S. dollar strengthened on increased hopes that Trump could make progress on his fiscal plans.

Democrats are likely to reject the Trump administration’s tax plan, which promises to deliver up to $6 trillion in tax cuts to businesses and people but will bloat the federal deficit by $1.5 trillion over the next decade.

FISCAL HAWK

Senator Rand Paul, a fiscal hawk, was the lone Republican to vote against the budget measure on Thursday. He objected to spending levels that he said would exceed agreed caps by $43 billion, and called for spending reforms for so-called entitlements such as the Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programs.

On Friday, Paul said in a post on Twitter that he was “all in” for the “biggest, boldest cuts possible - and soon!” But he did not address the specifics of the tax plan.

Trump on Friday expressed optimism about the tax reform, saying Paul would eventually back the proposed tax measure when it comes up for a vote.

“The Budget passed late last night, 51 to 49. We got ZERO Democrat votes with only Rand Paul (he will vote for Tax Cuts) voting against,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “This now allows for the passage of large scale Tax Cuts (and Reform), which will be the biggest in the history of our country!”

Trump told Fox Business Network in a television interview set to air on Sunday that he thinks Republicans have the votes to pass a big tax cut package. He said he had been thinking about tying tax legislation to an infrastructure spending bill but that it was not clear a combined package would gain more votes.

“I don’t want to take any chances cause I feel we have the votes right now the way it is,” he said, according to a transcript provided by the cable news outlet.

The budget resolution passed by the Senate on Thursday has to be reconciled with a markedly different version passed by the House, where Republicans say negotiations on a unified measure could take up to two weeks.

The House budget resolution calls for a revenue-neutral tax bill and would combine tax cuts with $203 billion in spending cuts to mandatory programs, including food assistance for the poor.

As far as spending cuts go, the Senate version only instructs the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to save at least $1 billion over the next decade.

That difference could set up a possible conflict between Republicans in the Senate and House as they negotiate a final budget blueprint.

Overhauling the complex U.S. tax code has defied Washington since 1986.

In the current effort, some Republican senators question the planned repeal of a 40 percent inheritance tax levied on estates worth more than $5.5 million, or $11 million for married couples, a tax paid only by the wealthiest American taxpayers.

Republican lawmakers from high-tax states such as New York are also seeking compromise on repealing the deduction from federal taxes for state and local tax payments.

The party’s lawmakers agree roughly on lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent but have not settled on a final number.

Trump seeks to cut the corporate rate to 20 percent, which he says would create jobs and boost wages for blue-collar workers.

Asked how he would make the case that the plan would not be a tax cut for the wealthy, House Speaker Paul Ryan told CBS, “That’s why we’re introducing the fourth bracket, so that high-income earners do not see a big rate cut and those resources go to the middle class ... and closing loopholes and carve outs which disproportionately benefit the very high-income people.”",www.reuters.com,center,FrAO4NlBhy6621SR

This Friday , that means tax returns . The Clinton campaign , in an effort to pressure Donald Trump into releasing his taxes , released the Clintons ' 2015 numbers . The Clintons made $ 10.6 million combined , mostly from speeches , and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent . Clinton 's vice presidential candidate , Tim Kaine , also released 10 years ' returns . In 2015 , Kaine made about $ 313,000 and paid a 16.1 percent tax rate . ( Here are all the tax returns released by the Clinton campaign . )
Clinton and her husband , former President Bill Clinton , have already released tax returns dating to the 1970s given their long history in public life . The Clintons , in June of last year , released the previous eight years of returns . Here 's some of what we found out from those , as reported by NPR 's Scott Horsley :
Income : The Clintons `` earned $ 139 million since 2007 . They paid nearly $ 44 million in federal taxes during that period . '' Much of that income came from paid speeches .
The Clintons `` earned $ 139 million since 2007 . They paid nearly $ 44 million in federal taxes during that period . '' Much of that income came from paid speeches .

The couple 's effective federal tax rate ranged from 25 percent in 2007 to 36 percent last year . ( The average American pays about 10 percent in tax . The wealthiest pay about 25 percent . ) Charity : `` The Clintons ... gave between 8 and 15 percent to charity '' ( mostly through the Clinton Family Foundation ) .
It has become tradition in U.S. presidential politics that the party standard-bearers release their tax returns . In fact , every major-party nominee in recent history has done so . Trump , though , has declined to follow suit . Why ? Trump says he is being audited by the IRS and wo n't release his taxes until that audit is done . But there 's nothing preventing Trump from releasing his taxes while under audit , a point the Clinton campaign and its supporters have pressed , arguing that Trump must be hiding something .
It 's possible Trump pays $ 0 in taxes , or close to it , the New York Times reported , because of deductions for real estate developers . There 's some history of that for Trump , who `` reported losses and paid no federal income tax in 1978 and 1979 and paid only modest sums — a total of less than $ 75,000 — for the prior three years , '' the Times wrote .
Trump himself fueled that speculation when he told ABC 's George Stephanopoulos in May , `` I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible . ''
That Americans demand that the people who run for president serve up what amounts to a financial colonoscopy is something of an odd , voyeuristic tradition . ( You can read all of the released tax returns from past presidents and vice presidents and the current 2016 field here at the Tax History Project 's archive . Candidates are also required under federal law to release financial disclosures that show ranges of the worth of assets and debts . )
Below are three reasons we care about what 's in those tax returns — and a little history of where this tradition came from .
It 's a political cliche to say that if you want a friend in Washington get a dog .
And the origin of politicians releasing their tax returns goes back to Richard Nixon — and his cocker spaniel .
Nixon , running as Eisenhower 's vice president in 1952 , was accused of financial wrongdoing `` related to a fund established by political backers to pay for campaign expenses , '' Joseph J. Thorndike of the Tax History Project wrote in 2012 .
Nixon admitted to taking one gift — Checkers , the family dog — from a donor . `` [ T ] he kids , like all kids , love the dog , '' Nixon said , `` and I just want to say this , right now , that regardless of what they say about it , we 're gon na keep it . ''
What 's become known as Nixon 's `` Checkers speech '' was all an attempt to clear his name . He challenged the Democratic Party ticket , headed by Adlai Stevenson , to `` make a complete financial statement as to their financial history , '' as he believed he had .
If they did n't , Nixon alleged , it would be proof `` they have something to hide . '' So Stevenson and his running mate , Alabama Sen. John Sparkman , released a decade of their tax returns . Eisenhower , the guy at the top of the ticket with Nixon , even released a summary of his own taxes .
The practice of releasing taxes did n't become tradition until 21 years later — again involving Nixon . PolitiFact wrote :
`` The IRS audited Nixon in 1973 , when questions bubbled up about a fishy charitable donation and speculation that Nixon had tried to game the tax system , according to a paper prepared for the United States Capitol Historical Society . ( This happened around the same time as the Watergate investigation but was a separate issue . ) Nixon said one of his most well-known lines amid this scandal : 'People have got to know whether or not their president is a crook . Well , I am not a crook ' . `` Nixon eventually released a slew of financial information to the public in December 1973 , including the previous four years of tax returns , to try to quell the criticism . He asked a congressional committee to examine them , too . However , the congressional investigation ultimately found that Nixon owed $ 476,431 ( approximately $ 2.3 million in today 's dollars ) in unpaid taxes and accrued interest . Oops . ''
From that point on , tax-return disclosure became the norm for people wanting to be president .
1 . Conflicts of interest : Almost every candidate who runs for public office is fairly wealthy . ( Even the candidates who have the government pay their salary , like Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden , make far more money than the average American . ) Because of that wealth , how they made their money ( we 'll get to heart in a second ) can tell you whether they have potential conflicts of interest — who they made that money from .
Trump 's business interests all over the world could become entangled with presidential politics . Just look at his response to Brexit — that the dropping euro could be good for tourism to places like his Scottish golf course . For the Clintons , the Clinton foundation could also raise the issue of conflicts of interest as it raises gobs of money from foreign entities . Would some of those governments expect special treatment from a second President Clinton ? A look at recently released emails from her time at the State Department — and what aides did for big Clinton foundation donors — gives people reason to question .
2 . Do they have heart ? Tax returns tell us how much candidates give to charity . The Clintons , as noted above , gave between 8 and 15 percent — or about $ 15 million total — during that eight-year period . Most of that went through the Clinton Family Foundation , as The Atlantic reported . They also contributed to the Nelson Mandela Foundation , First United Methodist Church and the Humana Challenge golf tournament .
People could have questions about why so much of their money went to their own foundation — and whether that 's really in the spirit of giving . For Trump , on the other hand , it took a Washington Post investigation to unearth that he had n't given $ 1 million to veterans ' charities , as he had promised after a fundraiser he held earlier this year ( an event he held in competition with a debate he decided not to attend because he was upset that Fox News ' Megyn Kelly was moderating ) . Trump eventually laid out how much was raised and allocated in a testy news conference . So is criticism of Trump unfair ? Is he really quietly a very charitable person — or not ? Tax returns would reveal that .
3 . Are they like us ? Again , these candidates are much wealthier than the average American . Median household income in this country is $ 53,482 , according to the census . The Clintons made $ 28 million in 2014 ( mostly from speeches ) . They also live in a posh New York suburb , Chappaqua , where they bought their home for $ 1.7 million in 1999 just before leaving the White House . ( In 2016 money , that appreciates to about $ 2.5 million . ) The average home price in the U.S. in June 2016 was $ 358,000 ( median home price was $ 307,000 ) .
Trump , of course , makes it a point to say he 's `` really rich , '' claiming he 's worth $ 9 billion . Trump 's net worth is something of a mystery . He says it fluctuates even based on his own `` feelings . '' The Washington Post reported this week on a 2007 deposition that caught Trump in repeated lies and exaggerations when it came to his wealth and earnings . His tax returns would certainly clarify whether he is as rich as he says .
There 's also the business of tax rates . The Clintons have paid a fairly high tax rate over the years . Trump , on the other hand , has boasted that , `` I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible '' and called his tax rate `` none of your business . '' But when a candidate fights hard to pay less in taxes than most people , especially when he is uber-rich , that can be a political problem . That was certainly the case in 2012 , when the Obama campaign and its outside group allies were able to paint Mitt Romney as someone who got away with paying less in taxes . ( Romney paid an effective tax rate of 14 percent because so much of his income came from dividends and capital gains . )","3 Reasons We Care About Politicians' Taxes

That Americans demand that the people who run for president serve up what amounts to a financial colonoscopy is something of an odd, voyeuristic tradition. (You can read all of the released tax returns from past presidents and vice presidents and the current 2016 field here at the Tax History Project's archive. Candidates are also required under federal law to release financial disclosures that show ranges of the worth of assets and debts.)

Below are three reasons we care about what's in those tax returns — and a little history of where this tradition came from.

First, A Little History

It's a political cliche to say that if you want a friend in Washington get a dog.

And the origin of politicians releasing their tax returns goes back to Richard Nixon — and his cocker spaniel.

Nixon, running as Eisenhower's vice president in 1952, was accused of financial wrongdoing ""related to a fund established by political backers to pay for campaign expenses,"" Joseph J. Thorndike of the Tax History Project wrote in 2012.

Nixon admitted to taking one gift — Checkers, the family dog — from a donor. ""[T]he kids, like all kids, love the dog,"" Nixon said, ""and I just want to say this, right now, that regardless of what they say about it, we're gonna keep it.""

What's become known as Nixon's ""Checkers speech"" was all an attempt to clear his name. He challenged the Democratic Party ticket, headed by Adlai Stevenson, to ""make a complete financial statement as to their financial history,"" as he believed he had.

If they didn't, Nixon alleged, it would be proof ""they have something to hide."" So Stevenson and his running mate, Alabama Sen. John Sparkman, released a decade of their tax returns. Eisenhower, the guy at the top of the ticket with Nixon, even released a summary of his own taxes.

Nixon, though, did not.

The practice of releasing taxes didn't become tradition until 21 years later — again involving Nixon. PolitiFact wrote:

""The IRS audited Nixon in 1973, when questions bubbled up about a fishy charitable donation and speculation that Nixon had tried to game the tax system, according to a paper prepared for the United States Capitol Historical Society.

Because of that wealth, how they made their money (we'll get to heart in a second) can tell you whether they have potential conflicts of interest — who they made that money from.

Trump's business interests all over the world could become entangled with presidential politics.

“ It definitely made the bill stronger , ” said Rep. Jason Smith ( R-Mo . ) , a member of both GOP leadership and the tax committee .
Brady noted that these changes were inspired by the suggestions of GOP lawmakers on the committee .

“ We feel really good , ” one White House official told ███ . “ A bill will pass the House next week for sure . ”
The handful of GOP lawmakers who have come out against the bill are mostly from high-tax blue states who are concerned because the bill does away with most of the state and local tax ( SALT ) deduction .

Others haven ’ t committed yet to supporting the bill . Some conservatives have expressed concerns about the fact that the measure keeps the top tax bracket at 39.6 percent and creates a “ bubble rate ” above that for some income of high earners in order to claw back the benefits of the 12 percent bracket for the wealthy .
Rep. Andy Biggs ( R-Ariz. ) , a member of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus , told ███ on Friday that he was still undecided .
He said there are `` a lot of really good things in the bill '' and was happy to see the adoption tax credit restored . But he also wished the bill 's tax cuts were retroactive and thinks that Congress should ensure that every taxpayer sees a rate reduction .
`` I 'm a little bit disappointed that we 're not eliminating the clawback provision , '' he said .
Biggs added that he 's `` hopeful that the process continues to be open to changes . ''

“ # TaxReform that raises your taxes is the wrong direction , ” he tweeted .
While things look positive for the House vote , Republicans have missed past deadlines they have set for themselves . At the joint House and Senate GOP retreat in January , Ryan mapped out a timeline for rank-and-file Republicans showing they ’ d get a tax bill to Trump ’ s desk by August . They also failed to repeal ObamaCare , despite campaigning on doing so for years .
But Republicans are highly motivated to accomplish one of the top items on their legislative agenda , especially after last week ’ s election losses in Virginia .
“ I think a lot of people in Washington are taking a message from the Virginia elections that voters are discontent with the lack of policy progress in Washington , ” said Scott Hodge , president of the Tax Foundation . “ And I think that ’ s provided some urgency to both the House and the Senate to get this tax-reform plan to the president ’ s desk before Christmas . ”
Senate Republicans released their own tax bill Thursday that has many differences from the House ’ s measure .
The Senate bill fully repeals the state and local tax deduction . That would be unacceptable to many House Republicans from blue states , including some who appear likely to vote for the House bill .
And some aspects of the Senate bill may not be well received from conservatives in the House . The Senate measure does not repeal the estate tax and delays until 2019 cutting the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent . The House bill slashes the corporate rate more immediately .
“ To me , that is the biggest conflict between the House version and the Senate version , ” Walker said in the interview .
He and other GOP sources said there could be some minor , last-minute changes to the House bill before it gets a final vote , especially as House leaders pore over the details of the Senate proposal .
“ I still think there are a few tweaks and adjustments to be made ” Walker said .
Ryan made it clear that if both chambers pass tax bills , they would go to a conference committee rather than the House simply voting on the Senate ’ s measure .
But it ’ s not clear yet if the Senate bill even has the votes yet to clear its own chamber , where Republicans can only afford two defections . Some GOP senators , such as Jeff Flake Jeffrey ( Jeff ) Lane FlakeFlake tells GOP : Trump 'does not deserve reelection ' Republicans show signs of discomfort in defense of Trump Cindy McCain : I can see Arizona 'going Democrat ' in 2020 MORE of Arizona and James Lankford James Paul LankfordMcConnell support for election security funds leaves Dems declaring victory Election security funds passed by Senate seen as welcome first step Senate committee approves 0 million for state election security efforts MORE of Oklahoma , are concerned about the bill ’ s impact on the debt .

A wild card in the process is Trump , who at times has weighed in on the tax process but is now abroad on a nearly two-week Asia trip .
Following reports that lawmakers were considering reducing the cap on pretax contributions to 401 ( k ) plans , Trump tweeted that changes to the retirement plans would not be made .
More recently , Trump has been pushing for tax-reform legislation to include repeal of ObamaCare ’ s individual mandate . As of now , that ’ s not a part of either the House or Senate bills , but the idea is still under discussion .","House Republicans are on the precipice of a big victory on tax reform, but the legislation still faces enormous hurdles before it can reach President Trump’s desk and be signed into law.

Legislation is expected to receive a vote on the House floor this week after clearing the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee in a party-line vote with no GOP defections.

At this point it would be a surprise if Republicans weren’t able to pass the bill through the House.

“I do believe that the momentum continues to move us forward,” Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee, told The Hill.

He said Republicans can’t afford to hold off the bill after the failure to approve ObamaCare repeal. Last week’s losses in off-year elections across the country just added urgency for Republicans.

“It will be difficult for members who voted against ObamaCare repeal to go 0-for-2 on their campaign promises,” Walker said. “I’d look for a huge vote.”

The amendment created a new 9 percent tax rate for some small-business income — earning the support of the National Federation of Independent Business, which panned the initial House bill. It also restored the adoption tax credit, a top priority for conservatives.

“It definitely made the bill stronger,” said Rep. Jason Smith (R-Mo.), a member of both GOP leadership and the tax committee.

Brady noted that these changes were inspired by the suggestions of GOP lawmakers on the committee. He said he heard from every one of the panel’s Republicans that they needed to provide more help for small businesses, and he noted that Reps.

I'm white.' Trump signs bipartisan IRS reform bill MORE (R-Pa.) have been big champions of the adoption tax credit.

Following the markup, Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee were upbeat.

GOP vote-counters predicted the tax bill would attract between 225 and 230 Republican votes — well above the 218 votes needed to pass it. Republicans will pick up another “yes” vote on Monday, when Rep.-elect John Curtis (R-Utah), who backs the tax plan, takes the oath of office.

“We feel really good,” one White House official told The Hill. “A bill will pass the House next week for sure.”

The handful of GOP lawmakers who have come out against the bill are mostly from high-tax blue states who are concerned because the bill does away with most of the state and local tax (SALT) deduction.

“My message to our leadership is it is a matter of fundamental fairness that [the SALT deduction] be preserved and that there shouldn’t be winner states and loser states,” said Rep. Leonard Lance Leonard LanceGun debate to shape 2020 races GOP fears Trump backlash in suburbs Bottom Line MORE (R-N.J.), a top Democratic target in 2018 who is whipping “no” on the bill.

Others haven’t committed yet to supporting the bill. Some conservatives have expressed concerns about the fact that the measure keeps the top tax bracket at 39.6 percent and creates a “bubble rate” above that for some income of high earners in order to claw back the benefits of the 12 percent bracket for the wealthy.

Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), a member of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus, told The Hill on Friday that he was still undecided.

He said there are ""a lot of really good things in the bill"" and was happy to see the adoption tax credit restored. But he also wished the bill's tax cuts were retroactive and thinks that Congress should ensure that every taxpayer sees a rate reduction.

""I'm a little bit disappointed that we're not eliminating the clawback provision,"" he said.

Biggs added that he's ""hopeful that the process continues to be open to changes.""

Rep. Warren Davidson Warren Earl DavidsonFinancial sector's work on SAFE Banking Act shows together, everyone achieves more Conservatives call on Pelosi to cancel August recess GOP leaders struggle to contain conservative anger over budget deal MORE (R-Ohio), another Freedom Caucus member, said on Twitter Friday that he’s still looking at taxpayer scenarios under the bill.

“#TaxReform that raises your taxes is the wrong direction,” he tweeted.

While things look positive for the House vote, Republicans have missed past deadlines they have set for themselves. At the joint House and Senate GOP retreat in January, Ryan mapped out a timeline for rank-and-file Republicans showing they’d get a tax bill to Trump’s desk by August. They also failed to repeal ObamaCare, despite campaigning on doing so for years.

But Republicans are highly motivated to accomplish one of the top items on their legislative agenda, especially after last week’s election losses in Virginia.

“I think a lot of people in Washington are taking a message from the Virginia elections that voters are discontent with the lack of policy progress in Washington,” said Scott Hodge, president of the Tax Foundation. “And I think that’s provided some urgency to both the House and the Senate to get this tax-reform plan to the president’s desk before Christmas.”

Further challenges lie ahead.

Senate Republicans released their own tax bill Thursday that has many differences from the House’s measure.

The Senate bill fully repeals the state and local tax deduction. That would be unacceptable to many House Republicans from blue states, including some who appear likely to vote for the House bill.

And some aspects of the Senate bill may not be well received from conservatives in the House. The Senate measure does not repeal the estate tax and delays until 2019 cutting the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. The House bill slashes the corporate rate more immediately.

“To me, that is the biggest conflict between the House version and the Senate version,” Walker said in the interview.

He and other GOP sources said there could be some minor, last-minute changes to the House bill before it gets a final vote, especially as House leaders pore over the details of the Senate proposal.

“I still think there are a few tweaks and adjustments to be made” Walker said.

Ryan made it clear that if both chambers pass tax bills, they would go to a conference committee rather than the House simply voting on the Senate’s measure.

But it’s not clear yet if the Senate bill even has the votes yet to clear its own chamber, where Republicans can only afford two defections. Some GOP senators, such as Jeff Flake Jeffrey (Jeff) Lane FlakeFlake tells GOP: Trump 'does not deserve reelection' Republicans show signs of discomfort in defense of Trump Cindy McCain: I can see Arizona 'going Democrat' in 2020 MORE of Arizona and James Lankford James Paul LankfordMcConnell support for election security funds leaves Dems declaring victory Election security funds passed by Senate seen as welcome first step Senate committee approves 0 million for state election security efforts MORE of Oklahoma, are concerned about the bill’s impact on the debt.

A wild card in the process is Trump, who at times has weighed in on the tax process but is now abroad on a nearly two-week Asia trip.

Following reports that lawmakers were considering reducing the cap on pretax contributions to 401(k) plans, Trump tweeted that changes to the retirement plans would not be made.

More recently, Trump has been pushing for tax-reform legislation to include repeal of ObamaCare’s individual mandate. As of now, that’s not a part of either the House or Senate bills, but the idea is still under discussion.",www.thehill.com,center,kjbT0ztvMBaXud7A

Will the corporate tax cut trickle down to workers and the broader economy? Or will it simply fatten the cash reserves of the largest U.S. companies and their shareholders?

After filing his or her 2012 tax return , an uninsured taxpayer should find out whether they qualify for a government subsidy , and if so , how large it will be . That Tax Day development will help them make a key choice this fall : whether to take that subsidy and buy insurance coverage for 2014 , or pay a fine to the IRS in 2015 .
In 2014 alone , the government is expected to spend $ 25 billion on subsidies to help people purchase coverage on the state-based health exchanges -- the online marketplaces where consumers can choose from various private insurance plans . The exchanges are expected to be ready for open enrollment by October of this year .
Getting customers to join the exchange -- and thus expanding health care coverage , the Affordable Care Act 's key objective -- requires the coordination of the Internal Revenue Service , Health and Human Services and other government agencies . The government is expected to collect more than $ 1 trillion in tax revenue over 10 years and dole out more than $ 1 trillion in subsidies .
`` This is a major new venture and like anything , no one can predict exactly how it 's going to work , '' Paul Van de Water , a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , explained to CBSNews.com . `` The HHS and the IRS and other agencies involved in this are working hard to implement it , but until the thing actually starts , no one 's really going to know what features need to be modified to make them work better . ''
Most of the tax-related elements of the Affordable Care Act do n't impact taxpayers directly -- they instead impact business sectors like the medical device industry or health insurers . Still , some Americans will start noticing through their 2012 tax return how Obamacare impacts their lives . And starting this year , others will be paying extra taxes because of the law .
Subsidies for the exchange will be available to individuals with household incomes between 100 and 400 percent of the Federal poverty level -- taking into account factors like family size .
By 2022 , according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office , an estimated 26 million people will get their insurance through state exchanges .

After filing his or her 2012 tax return, an uninsured taxpayer should find out whether they qualify for a government subsidy, and if so, how large it will be. That Tax Day development will help them make a key choice this fall: whether to take that subsidy and buy insurance coverage for 2014, or pay a fine to the IRS in 2015.

In 2014 alone, the government is expected to spend $25 billion on subsidies to help people purchase coverage on the state-based health exchanges -- the online marketplaces where consumers can choose from various private insurance plans. The exchanges are expected to be ready for open enrollment by October of this year.

Getting customers to join the exchange -- and thus expanding health care coverage, the Affordable Care Act's key objective -- requires the coordination of the Internal Revenue Service, Health and Human Services and other government agencies. The government is expected to collect more than $1 trillion in tax revenue over 10 years and dole out more than $1 trillion in subsidies.

""This is a major new venture and like anything, no one can predict exactly how it's going to work,"" Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, explained to CBSNews.com. ""The HHS and the IRS and other agencies involved in this are working hard to implement it, but until the thing actually starts, no one's really going to know what features need to be modified to make them work better.""

Most of the tax-related elements of the Affordable Care Act don't impact taxpayers directly -- they instead impact business sectors like the medical device industry or health insurers. Still, some Americans will start noticing through their 2012 tax return how Obamacare impacts their lives. And starting this year, others will be paying extra taxes because of the law.

Calculating subsidies

Subsidies for the exchange will be available to individuals with household incomes between 100 and 400 percent of the Federal poverty level -- taking into account factors like family size.

By 2022, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, an estimated 26 million people will get their insurance through state exchanges. Up to this point, however, most people don't understand how the health care law will impact them directly or what their taxes have to do with it.

Congress Clamps Down

In 2010, Congress passed the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA, that calls for overseas banks to begin full disclosure of U.S. account holders beginning next year. All along, Washington has been pursuing new bilateral treaties to share tax information.

""Countries are almost universally agreeing to exchange tax information,"" says Shay, who like Brown is a former high-ranking Treasury official.

""The signal seems to be that it doesn't matter where you move your money, we can still get you,"" he says. ""This signal is being heard not just in Switzerland, but in the Caribbean and the Far East.""

He stresses that not all undisclosed offshore accounts are tied to someone who is a tax evader.

In Cedar Rapids , Mr. Obama plans to visit the home of Jason and Ali McLaughlin , a high school principal and an account manager at a document-scanning company , a campaign official said . The McLaughlin family , with a combined income of $ 82,000 , would face an extra $ 2,000 burden next year if the tax cuts on the middle class expired as scheduled , the campaign said .
White House officials insisted that Monday ’ s move was more than politics . They said it would ease anxiety over the “ fiscal cliff ” — the combination of tax increases and automatic spending cuts that are scheduled to kick in at the end of this year . That one-two punch , economists say , could deal a heavy blow to an already tender economy unless the White House and Congress work out some kind of compromise .
Proposing a one-year extension , a senior official said , recognizes that Mr. Obama and the Republicans are not likely to resolve the larger debate over whether to extend the Bush tax cuts for everyone or , as Mr. Obama has long advocated , just for the middle class . That debate is likely to be decided at the ballot box , where a victory by Mr. Romney would almost certainly enshrine all the tax cuts .
“ To the degree that there is concern about the economy , we ’ re saying , ‘ Let ’ s extend the middle class tax cuts for a year , ’ ” said Gene B. Sperling , director of the White House ’ s National Economic Council . “ Economically , extending tax cuts to those workers will have the most effect on them and the strongest impact on the economy . ”
A one-year extension for people making under $ 250,000 would cost the government $ 150 billion in revenue , the administration estimates , an amount that would be added to the deficit . In a point of comparison , economists estimate that letting the cuts expire for people above that threshold would generate $ 850 billion over 10 years .
While Mr. Obama returns to the tax issue this week , House Republican leaders will press forward Wednesday with a vote to fully repeal his health care law , testing their faith that they can make the law part of their attack on Democratic economic policies against evidence that swing voters want to move past the fight .
Just as Mr. Obama needs to worry about divisions on the tax bill , some Republicans are in disagreement over the wisdom of relitigating the health care law . Some Republicans , facing re-election in swing districts , are openly suggesting that some measures should remain . Representative David B. McKinley , a Republican freshman from West Virginia , said prohibitions on lifetime coverage caps and on discrimination against people with pre-existing medical conditions should “ absolutely ” stay in force , even if health care costs would have to rise .
“ If it means increasing my premiums , so be it , ” he said . “ That ’ s what insurance is about . ”
Mr. Romney ’ s supporters on the Sunday talk shows hammered away at the idea that Mr. Obama is at fault for the poor economy . Representative Tom Price , Republican of Georgia , said Mr. Romney supported preserving all of the Bush-era cuts for another year because he believes “ that will stimulate the economy and provide certainty out there in the job market . ”
For Mr. Obama , the biggest advantage of the tax proposal may be simply to move the political discussion off the job market . On his bus tour through Ohio and Pennsylvania last week , the president took pains to present himself as a guardian of the middle class , whose most cherished childhood memories included raiding the ice machine at a Howard Johnson while on a Greyhound tour of the United States .
On Friday , however , when the latest poor jobs number was reported , Mr. Obama was back to talking about the long road to recovery .","Andrea Saul, the spokeswoman for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign, in a statement issued shortly before Mr. Obama spoke, said: ""Unlike President Obama, Governor Romney understands that the last thing we need to do in this economy is to raise taxes on anyone.""

The struggle to frame the tax debate comes as the campaign moves into a period, only four months before the election, when the perceptions of voters begin to harden. Polls show a persistently tight race, with Mr. Romney closing in on Mr. Obama in certain swing states but with neither candidate able to break out decisively. Control of Congress is also up for grabs, with Mr. McConnell saying on Sunday that he believed the Republicans had a 50-50 chance to regain control of the Senate.

To find a compromise with Republicans on which Bush tax cuts to extend, Ms. Pelosi, the House minority leader, and Mr. Schumer, a member of the Senate Finance Committee, favor making $1 million the cutoff. Above that level, Mr. Schumer has said, people are not likely to spend the savings from lower taxes and help the economy.

Administration officials said they did not believe that the difference between the White House and these Democratic leaders was a big obstacle.

The White House hopes to squeeze maximum political mileage out of the White House event, surrounding Mr. Obama with families and workers who would benefit from the extension. On Tuesday, he will take his message to Iowa, the battleground state that turned him into a serious presidential contender in 2008.

That one-two punch, economists say, could deal a heavy blow to an already tender economy unless the White House and Congress work out some kind of compromise.

Proposing a one-year extension, a senior official said, recognizes that Mr. Obama and the Republicans are not likely to resolve the larger debate over whether to extend the Bush tax cuts for everyone or, as Mr. Obama has long advocated, just for the middle class. That debate is likely to be decided at the ballot box, where a victory by Mr. Romney would almost certainly enshrine all the tax cuts.

“To the degree that there is concern about the economy, we’re saying, ‘Let’s extend the middle class tax cuts for a year,’ ” said Gene B. Sperling, director of the White House’s National Economic Council. “Economically, extending tax cuts to those workers will have the most effect on them and the strongest impact on the economy.”

A one-year extension for people making under $250,000 would cost the government $150 billion in revenue, the administration estimates, an amount that would be added to the deficit. In a point of comparison, economists estimate that letting the cuts expire for people above that threshold would generate $850 billion over 10 years.

While Mr. Obama returns to the tax issue this week, House Republican leaders will press forward Wednesday with a vote to fully repeal his health care law, testing their faith that they can make the law part of their attack on Democratic economic policies against evidence that swing voters want to move past the fight.

Just as Mr. Obama needs to worry about divisions on the tax bill, some Republicans are in disagreement over the wisdom of relitigating the health care law. Some Republicans, facing re-election in swing districts, are openly suggesting that some measures should remain. Representative David B. McKinley, a Republican freshman from West Virginia, said prohibitions on lifetime coverage caps and on discrimination against people with pre-existing medical conditions should “absolutely” stay in force, even if health care costs would have to rise.

“If it means increasing my premiums, so be it,” he said. “That’s what insurance is about.”

Mr. Romney’s supporters on the Sunday talk shows hammered away at the idea that Mr. Obama is at fault for the poor economy. Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia, said Mr. Romney supported preserving all of the Bush-era cuts for another year because he believes “that will stimulate the economy and provide certainty out there in the job market.”

For Mr. Obama, the biggest advantage of the tax proposal may be simply to move the political discussion off the job market. On his bus tour through Ohio and Pennsylvania last week, the president took pains to present himself as a guardian of the middle class, whose most cherished childhood memories included raiding the ice machine at a Howard Johnson while on a Greyhound tour of the United States.

On Friday, however, when the latest poor jobs number was reported, Mr. Obama was back to talking about the long road to recovery.

Republicans are already reeling over the health care debacle. If they stumble on tax reform, Republicans risk looking as bad as the U.S. Men’s Soccer Team failing to qualify for the World Cup after losing to Trinidad and Tobago.

Tax reform faces three major enemies: parliamentary math, time and deficits.

Let’s start with parliamentary math.

The House now has 433 members -- 239 Republicans and 194 Democrats. That means Republicans can only lose 23 votes on their side of the aisle. The chamber recently adopted a budget as a special legislative prerequisite on tax reform. The GOP lost 18 of its own on that roll call tally alone. In other words, this is tight.

The Senate is another animal.

There are 52 Republicans and 48 senators who caucus with the Democrats. It takes two rounds of 60 votes to quash a filibuster on most legislation. There is no way Republicans can muscle through tax reform and overcome a filibuster -- even if they convince a few Democrats to play along.

That helps Republicans. Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., has missed several weeks after a hospital stay. Cochran is due back this week. But his absence could boost Democrats.

Know this: if the Senate blunders in approving a budget, tax reform is dead because GOPers can’t overcome a filibuster.

Now, the time shortfall.

For a variety of reasons, Ryan is reluctant to push tax reform into 2018 -- an election year.

Tax reform is his touchstone issue. So for the speaker, it’s optimum to wrap this up in 2017. However, the House and Senate must take a little time to merge their respective budgets into one. That easily slides matter into November.

Brady says he won’t schedule a “markup” session (in which lawmakers actually write the bill) until there’s resolution on the budget issue. If Brady sets up a markup, it likely means he has the votes to advance the tax bill out of committee.

With these barriers, it’s easy to see how days drip off the calendar in November, through Thanksgiving and get you to, voila, Christmas.

Then there’s the deficit.

Republicans are confident that cutting taxes won’t bust the deficit. Those special budget rules, which enable GOPers to sidestep Senate filibusters, prohibit Congress from adding to the deficit over a 10-year period.

But rarely has Congress approved a bill under such rules that didn’t increase the deficit at the end of the 10-year window. Congress often puts “tough” spending decisions in the “out” years of such packages. The savings are never realized.

Lawmakers don’t regret spending for natural disasters. But the deficit-reduction conversation has gone silent.

Why?

“We’ve come to the realization that we simply cannot cut,” conceded one conservative House Republican.

How’s that for honesty?

The question is whether those budgetary concerns are realized in opposition to the tax reform bill.

RAISE RATES

Let Bush tax cuts expire on income over $250,000: Obama and Democrats want to let the Bush tax cuts expire on income over $250,000 ($200,000 for singles). They would raise the top two income tax rates, increase high-income households' capital gains and dividend rates, and re-impose limits on their personal exemptions and itemized deductions. It would also increase the estate tax rate.

All told, that proposal could raise close to $1 trillion over 10 years.

Let Bush tax cuts expire on income over $500,000: Allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire on income over $500,000 ($400,000 for singles) could raise at least $315 billion over a decade, according to Tax Policy Center data.

Let Bush tax cuts expire on income over $1,000,000: If they expire on income over $1 million, at least $242 billion could be raised.

Impose higher tax rate on fund managers: The president has called for taxing ""carried interest"" as ordinary income, raising an additional $13.5 billion over a decade.

Managers of private equity, venture capital and hedge funds are only taxed 15% on the portion of their compensation known as carried interest, which is derived from a fund's profits when an investment is sold.

If carried interest were taxed as ordinary income, those managers would pay more than double the rate they do now.

ADD A MILLIONAIRE MINIMUM TAX

Impose a ""Buffett Rule"": Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has been very vocal about calling for higher taxes on the rich.

Obama has proposed a ""guiding principle"" for tax reform: Those making $1 million or more should have to pay at least 30% of their income in federal income taxes.

Senate Democrats proposed a bill last spring that would have imposed a 30% minimum effective federal tax rate on adjusted gross income above $1 million, although it would phase in between $1 million and $2 million.

The bill was estimated by the Joint Committee on Taxation to raise an estimated $47 billion over a decade if all the Bush tax cuts expire. By contrast, the measure would raise $162 billion relative to a scenario in which all the Bush tax cuts are extended.

CURB TAX BREAKS

Cap itemized deductions by a dollar amount: The highest-income households enjoy more than 40% of the benefits of all tax breaks taken every year.

If no one could claim more than $50,000 in itemized deductions, that could raise roughly $749 billion over a decade, the Tax Policy Center estimates. And nearly 90% of that revenue would come from households making more than $200,000.

If lawmakers wanted to exclude charitable contributions from that cap, that still could raise $490 billion over 10 years.

Cap rate used to calculate tax savings: Obama has proposed limiting the value of deductions and exclusions for high-income households.

Normally one multiplies one's top tax rate by the amount of a deduction to calculate the taxes saved. But Obama would cap that rate at 28%, which is below the top two income tax rates. So someone in the 35% bracket today would save $35 on a $100 deduction. Under Obama's proposal, she would save $28.

The proposal is estimated to raise $523 billion over 10 years, assuming the Bush tax cuts expire on income over $250,000.

Limit the after-tax value of certain tax breaks: Lawmakers could enact an after-tax cap that applies to itemized deductions, plus the child tax credit and the tax-free benefit workers receive when their employer helps pay for their health insurance.

A cap set at 2% of one's adjusted gross income or $10,000, whichever is less, applied only to households making more than $200,000, could raise more than $860 billion over 10 years, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",www.money.cnn.com,left,WDpM7TaPOakhsZPr

US President Donald Trump has hailed sweeping tax reforms after they were given final approval by Congress, despite fierce criticism by Democrats.

""We are making America great again,"" a jubilant Mr Trump said.

He is expected to sign his first major legislative achievement - the biggest rewrite of the US tax code in a generation - in the coming days.

The bill slashes taxes for corporations and the wealthy, while offering mixed, temporary relief to working people.

Democrats have labelled the Republican tax bill ""government for sale"", with prominent Senator Elizabeth Warren describing it as a ""heist"".

Hosting Republican leaders at the White House, President Trump said: ""This will indeed be a very big day when people look back at our country.""

He thanked congressional leaders for pushing through what he called ""the largest tax cut in the history of our country"".

Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan praised Mr Trump's ""exquisite presidential leadership"" for the success of the bill.

Earlier, in a statement, Mr Trump said: ""I promised the American people a big, beautiful tax cut for Christmas. With final passage of this legislation, that is exactly what they are getting.""

Because of a procedural glitch, the bill had to be voted on for a second time in the Republican-dominated House of Representatives. It passed by 224 votes to 201 on Wednesday afternoon.

Democrats say that error was caused by Republicans rushing the most sweeping overhaul of the tax system since 1986 through Congress.

In an often secretive process, no public hearings were held and multiple last-minute amendments that were pushed by lobbyists cropped up in the final version.

The unpopular bill is likely to be a major issue during next year's mid-term congressional elections.

Fifty-two per cent of adults said they opposed the tax plan, while only 27% supported it, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.

Who wins and who loses?

Non-partisan analysts say the greatest beneficiaries of the package will be the super-wealthy, multinational corporations and the commercial property industry.

In the immediate future, the plan will see the vast majority of taxpayers having lower tax bills, but those cuts expire in 2025.

By 2027, the Tax Policy Center estimates the overall change would be negligible.

And 53% of taxpayers would face higher bills, many of them in the lower income brackets.

The bill is projected to add $1.5tn (£1.1tn) over the next decade to the $20tn US debt, which Mr Trump promised last year he would eliminate.

But Republicans argue it will boost economic growth.

The legislation reaches beyond fiscal matters to tick off a wish list of conservative priorities.

It strikes a serious blow to Obamacare, scrapping the fine levied on Americans who do not buy health insurance.

Analysis: One final swoop

By Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter

It wasn't exactly easy, but President Trump now has his signature legislative achievement. The self-styled dealmaker-in-chief was finally able to flex his party's majority muscle, overcoming internal dissent to accomplish some long-sought political goals.

What one Congress can do another can undo, of course, and the task ahead for Republicans is selling a sceptical public on the benefits of their plan.

While they may argue that Americans will come around once they see lower tax bills, many may have already made up their mind.

Like Obamacare eight years ago, this tax legislation was passed by partisan muscle alone. And like that law, many Americans view the legislation as largely benefitting others. They will be difficult to convince otherwise.

Repealing key provisions of this tax law will be as uniting for Democrats as healthcare repeal was for conservatives.

taxes,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/2/irs-defends-refunds-illegals-never-filed-taxes/,IRS defends paying refunds to illegals who never filed taxes,2015-03-02,Stephen Dinan,"The IRS is defending its decision to let illegal immigrants claim up to three years ’ refunds on income even if they never paid income taxes , telling Congress in a new letter last week that agency lawyers have concluded getting a Social Security number triggers the ability to go back and ask for previous refunds .
President Obama ’ s new deportation amnesty could grant Social Security numbers to as many as 4 million illegal immigrants , making many of them eligible for tax refunds under the Earned Income Tax Credit even for years when they cheated on their taxes , by working off the books and not filing tax returns .
“ Section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code requires an SSN on the return , but a taxpayer claiming the EITC is not required to have an SSN before the close of the year for which the EITC is claimed , ” IRS Commissioner John Koskinen wrote in his letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley on Wednesday .
The IRS ’ s chief lawyer had reached that conclusion in 2000 , and the agency has newly confirmed it , Mr. Koskinen said .
Mr. Grassley called that a mockery of the law and said he will try to write a bill specifically prohibiting it .
“ The tax code shouldn ’ t reward those who broke our immigration laws , ” the Iowa Republican and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee said in a statement .

President Obama’s new deportation amnesty could grant Social Security numbers to as many as 4 million illegal immigrants, making many of them eligible for tax refunds under the Earned Income Tax Credit even for years when they cheated on their taxes, by working off the books and not filing tax returns.

“Section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code requires an SSN on the return, but a taxpayer claiming the EITC is not required to have an SSN before the close of the year for which the EITC is claimed,” IRS Commissioner John Koskinen wrote in his letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley on Wednesday.

The IRS’s chief lawyer had reached that conclusion in 2000, and the agency has newly confirmed it, Mr. Koskinen said.

Mr. Grassley called that a mockery of the law and said he will try to write a bill specifically prohibiting it.

“The tax code shouldn’t reward those who broke our immigration laws,” the Iowa Republican and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee said in a statement.

“Will you guarantee the American people there will be zero cuts to benefits in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid?” Sanders said.

Toomey said there were no plans to cut the programs, but activists are skeptical.

“This is a tax bill that’s coming after Medicare and Medicaid cuts,” said Eliot Fishman, senior director of health policy at Families USA. “It’s fundamentally step one of a two-step process. Nobody should be under any illusions otherwise.”

Senate Republicans on Friday scrambled to piece together their legislation ahead of a final vote. The bill passed despite the $1 trillion price tag.

Corker wanted to add $350 billion in automatic tax increases to reduce the bill’s impact on the debt, but other Republicans balked. He originally called for a tax-increase trigger, but that provision ran into issues with the Senate parliamentarian and couldn’t be included in the bill.

On Friday, Corker announced his opposition to the legislation.

“I wanted to get to yes. But at the end of the day, I am not able to cast aside my fiscal concerns and vote for legislation that I believe, based on the information I currently have, could deepen the debt burden on future generations,” Corker said in a statement.

Corker’s worries about increasing deficits were not echoed by other rank-and-file Republicans or members of leadership. They said the bill would grow the economy, reducing the debt in the process.

Twenty-seven years ago today, Republicans and Democrats came together for a comprehensive tax reform package that strengthened economic growth and helped American companies compete in the global marketplace.

That was a long time ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was less than 2,000, “Top Gun” was the top movie and Rep. Patrick Murphy (D-Fla.), now the youngest member of Congress, was 3 years old. A lot has changed since then. One thing that hasn’t changed: the corporate tax rate.

Story Continued Below

In 1986, leaders of both parties, focusing on what was best for American jobs, together passed reform that spurred decades of economic growth. The 1986 model is clear and can work again. As former Sen. Bill Bradley, one of the leaders of the 1980s tax-reform push, explained, “There was something in there for both Democrats and Republicans. Republicans wanted lower rates and Democrats wanted fewer loopholes. And there was an agreement that, together, we could get both.”

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 gave America the lowest corporate tax in the world while broadening the base and provided a foundation for businesses to build on during the economic growth of the 1990s. Its goal, as President Ronald Reagan said the day he signed it, was “refueling the American growth economy.” Our Tax Code was the envy of the world. But a lot has changed, and, in terms of taxes, not for the better.

After passing the 1986 Tax Reform Act, the United States led the world not only in economic growth but also in international competitiveness. Since then, countries like Britain, Canada and Japan have reformed their own tax systems and continued to lower their corporate tax rates. The U.S. corporate tax rate of 35 percent is now the highest in the world, driving investment overseas. The result is American businesses moving abroad and taking headquarters and jobs with them.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Tax Code — now some 3 million words long — has become more cluttered. As House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp of Michigan says, “It’s 10 times the length of the Bible and none of the good news.”

The resulting flow of jobs and businesses to America’s international competitors has taken its toll. Ernst & Young recently estimated the U.S. gross domestic product to be 1.2 percent to 2 percent lower in 2013 than the year earlier because of the high corporate tax rate. And it gets worse: The U.S. economy is expected to be 1.5 percent to 2.6 percent smaller as other countries embrace competitive corporate tax rates at this nation’s expense.

The U.S. has long been the best country to start and build a business. Despite the difficulties created by its Tax Code, the U.S. remains the world’s economic leader. Technological centers like Silicon Valley are renowned the world over for giving rise to new technologies and industries and highlight American ingenuity and entrepreneurship. This is what Reagan spoke of when he mentioned a “spirit of enterprise” as he signed tax reform 27 years ago today in the Rose Garden.

It’s time to harness that spirit once more. Just as Reagan and Speaker of the House Tip O’Neill worked together on comprehensive tax reform in 1986, today’s leaders should do the same. We should not be looking wistfully back to the good old days when we were able to do big things. It can happen now: Leaders from both parties and both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue are calling for comprehensive tax reform that lowers the corporate rate to an internationally competitive level, broadening the base and growing the economy.

There are naysayers, just as there were back then. A 1986 Washington Post headline declared, “In taxes, the impossible became the inevitable.” Why can’t we do it again?

Actually , wait , that ’ s not true : I kind of understand why Democrats would want to do it . If it happens , it ’ ll be a heavy bludgeon to use against Republicans in the next election cycle .
One possible change would tax the entire salary earned by those making more than a certain level — $ 400,000 or so — at the top rate of 35 percent rather than allowing them to pay lower rates before they reach the target , as is the standard formula . That plan would allow Republicans to say they did not back down in their opposition to raising marginal tax rates and Democrats to say they prevailed by increasing effective tax rates on the rich . At the same time , it would provide an initial effort to reduce the deficit , which the negotiators call a down payment , as Congressional tax-writing committees hash out a broad overhaul of the tax code . That idea could be combined with the reinstatement tax code provisions that once prevented the rich from taking personal exemptions or itemizing deductions . Those rules were eliminated by the tax cut of 2001 . Reinstating them would tack an additional one to two percentage points onto the effective tax rates of high-income households without raising the 35 percent rate , but which households would be affected has not been decided . In all , tax experts say , families in the top tax bracket would find their effective tax rate jump to 41 percent , even though the top statutory rate would remain 35 percent… Under the existing tax code , the first $ 17,400 of adjusted gross income for a couple filing jointly is taxed at 10 percent . Above that level , up to $ 70,700 , income is taxed at 15 percent . Income between $ 70,701 and $ 142,700 is taxed at 25 percent . Gross incomes up to $ 217,450 are taxed at 28 percent . The next bracket , 33 percent , ends at $ 388,350 for couples . The top bracket hits adjusted gross incomes only above $ 388,350 .
In other words , instead of jacking up the top bracket from 35 percent to 39.6 percent , the way it was in the Clinton years , they ’ re going to essentially eliminate all of the lower brackets for taxpayers who earn beyond a certain amount ( e.g. , $ 400,000 ) and tax their entire earnings at 35 percent . No more marginal rates for high earners as described in the last paragraph of the excerpt . If you ’ re sitting on $ 399,999 in income and then you cross the magic threshold by earning another two bucks , boom — the marginal rates you used to calculate the taxes on your first $ 17,400 , $ 70,700 , $ 142,700 , etc , instantly disappear and all the money you ’ ve made gets taxed at the top rate . In practice , then , this operates like a surtax of a fixed amount on top earners ; if you look at the IRS ’ s tax tables , you can figure out the difference between $ 400,000 taxed entirely at 35 percent versus $ 400,000 taxed progressively at the current marginal rates . Unless I missed something , it ’ s upwards of $ 23,000 . Whether you make $ 400K , $ 4 million , or $ 400 million , then , you ’ d be paying the same effective surtax under the “ compromise ” plan : An extra $ 23,000 , on top of the 35 percent tax you ’ re paying as part of the top bracket .
Taking those tax brackets as Gospel , and relying on Excel and Keurig , I infer that if the effective average rate on income of $ 435,800 is 35 % , the marginal rate from $ 388,350 to 435,600 must be 100 % . Ouch . If all the phase-outs are spread out from $ 388,350 to $ 1,000,000 then the marginal rate over that bracket is 40 % . In that scenario , everyone with income over $ 1 million will have an average rate of 35 % ; all income over $ 1 million will be taxes at a marginal rate of 35 % … And the politics of this intermediate high bracket are ludicrous for the Republicans . Obama wants to raise the top marginal rate on everyone above some threshold to 39.6 % ( Let ’ s round that to 40 % for purposes of this mini-tirade ) . The Republican counter will be to raise the top marginal rate to 40 % on incomes from $ 400K to $ 1 million and then cut the rate back to 35 % ? That may protect large small-business owners , but only by throwing the smaller successful ones overboard .
Paying an extra $ 23,000 is small potatoes if you ’ re making $ 10 million a year , but to a small business owner who ’ s pulling down $ 400,000 or a bit more , it ’ s a big deal . Note Maguire ’ s point about the 100 percent effective rate for incomes just above the magic $ 400K threshold . Imagine a business owner doing an earnings projection in November and determining that he ’ s on pace to pull down $ 410,000 this year . Once he ’ s hit with the surtax , his income will fall to $ 387,000 . In other words , he ’ s … better off working less , to try to finish the year just under $ 400,000 in earnings so that he can keep his lower marginal rates intact . That would be less of a concern if you raised the threshold amount from $ 400,000 to , say , $ 1 million or $ 2 million , but I assume Democrats won ’ t go along with that . The amount they can raise from a $ 23,000 surtax aimed only at the very rich is nothing compared to the amount they could raise by restoring the top Clinton-era rate of 39.6 percent instead .

Tom Maguire spots the problem:

Taking those tax brackets as Gospel, and relying on Excel and Keurig, I infer that if the effective average rate on income of $435,800 is 35%, the marginal rate from $388,350 to 435,600 must be 100%.

taxes,The Economist,0,https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21741146-florida-senator-thinks-reheating-reaganomics-dead-end-marco-rubio-offers-his,Marco Rubio offers his Trump-crazed party a glint of hope,,,"THE episode that encapsulated the Republican establishment ’ s capitulation to Donald Trump had been planned as a repudiation of him . It was when Senator Marco Rubio , in a bid to salvage his sinking candidacy in the 2016 Republican primaries , suggested that Mr Trump had a small penis . Formerly known as a high-minded conservative , Mr Rubio also mocked the Republican front-runner ’ s hair and “ orange ” skin . “ Donald Trump likes to sue people , ” he told a crowd in Virginia , ahead of the round of primaries that more or less sealed Mr Trump ’ s capture of the Republican nomination . “ He should sue whoever did that to his face . ”
Two years on , Mr Rubio is plotting a more elevated response to the earthquake Mr Trump has triggered on the right . In an hour-long interview he describes his plan for a new “ reform conservative movement ” devoted to addressing the economic disruption and social disaffection that the president vigorously described . In offering himself as an optimistic Reaganite , Mr Rubio acknowledges that he missed the “ anxiety and anger ” Mr Trump tapped into . “ I spent a tremendous amount of time focused on the opportunities I had as the son of a bartender and a maid in the past century , ” he says . “ I didn ’ t spend nearly enough time talking about what the bartender and the maid face today . ”
The details of Mr Rubio ’ s new programme are unclear , but he suggests they will involve more interventions such as the increased child tax credit he inserted into the tax reform passed last year , and a provision for paid family leave he is working on now . He mulls the need for more public spending on technological research and for education reform , to prioritise vocational skills . He advocates a more flexible benefit system , to help the retraining of disrupted workers . Against the magnitude of America ’ s income inequality , such measures might seem modest . Yet from the lips of an orthodox Republican leader , they imply a serious reconsideration of the pre-eminent conservative ideals : a minimal government role in the economy and a related view of liberty as “ freedom from ” government interference . “ Government has an essential role to play in buffering this transition , ” he says . “ If we basically say everyone is on their own and the market ’ s going to take care of it , we will rip the country apart , because millions of good hardworking people lack the means to adapt. ” Economic liberty , in this retelling , becomes something the government is required to guarantee . It is the freedom to enjoy “ the dignity of work ” , says Mr Rubio . “ There needs to be a conservative movement that addresses these realities . ”
His implication that Republicans have found no good answer to the problems Mr Trump described is irrefutable . The president ’ s scheme to revive the 1970s economy through protectionism and deregulation is unrealistic , as Mr Rubio—who these days dares not criticise Mr Trump— can not help but acknowledge . “ The future is going to happen , ” he says . “ I have no problem with bringing back American car-manufacturing facilities , but , whether they ’ re American robots or Mexican robots , they ’ re going to be highly automated. ” Most Republican congressmen meanwhile remain entranced by the limited-government shibboleths he has shaken off , as his fight over the tax bill revealed . Mr Rubio ’ s proposal , to double the tax credit to $ 2,000 per child and pay for it by making a small increase to the corporate rate his party wanted , was decried by some Republicans as socialism . The watered-down version they accepted , as the price of Mr Rubio ’ s support for the bill , excluded the poorest families . “ There is still a lot of thinking on the right that if big corporations are happy , they ’ re going to take the money they ’ re saving and reinvest it in American workers , ” he says . “ In fact they bought back shares , a few gave out bonuses ; there ’ s no evidence whatsoever that the money ’ s been massively poured back into the American worker . ”
That shows how resistant Mr Rubio ’ s party will be to the changes he wants . “ I ’ m a minority within a minority , ” he says . Yet he is well-able to argue for them . Though not as astute as Ben Sasse or articulate as Ted Cruz , he is an engaging communicator with broad appeal . Social conservatives adore him ; pro-life and spikily partisan , he is no mushy centrist . Yet he retains a boyish earnestness that even Democrats find endearing . His golden back-story , as a son of poor immigrants , helps with that—and looks more relevant now than ever . “ My relatives are firefighters and nurses and teachers and electricians , ” he says . “ These are people who are not all that excited about the new economy . ”
The question , as always with Mr Rubio , is : how serious is he ? He has a record of taking enlightened positions—in backing intelligent climate-change policy , for example , and in his more recent support for immigration reform—then ditching them when the wind changes . His pitch also carries hints of that flakiness . He claims to have tempered his erstwhile enthusiasm for trade and immigration ; in reality , he has little to say about either . That , in turn , raises another familiar question : is Mr Rubio repudiating Mr Trump or capitulating to him ? The timing of his pitch is suspicious . He says his rethink reflects the truths he learned on the trail . But that was over two years ago . It might also be seen as a belated realisation , by a bruised but still-ambitious Republican , that the party of Trump will not return to conservative verities soon .
Even so , that underlines how important it is that Mr Rubio sees this through . He is not the only Republican taking a leaf from the president ’ s playbook . Yet in contrast to Trump acolytes such as Senator Tom Cotton or Mike Pompeo , the incoming secretary of state , he is unlikely to trace the president ’ s steps from economic populism to ethno-nationalism . That is not only good in itself . It is also why , having no divisive rhetoric to fall back on , he might try hardest to find solutions to the problems Mr Trump highlighted . It is a lot to expect from a gifted politician with a history of disappointing . But he might be the best hope his party has .","THE episode that encapsulated the Republican establishment’s capitulation to Donald Trump had been planned as a repudiation of him.

Formerly known as a high-minded conservative, Mr Rubio also mocked the Republican front-runner’s hair and “orange” skin. “Donald Trump likes to sue people,” he told a crowd in Virginia, ahead of the round of primaries that more or less sealed Mr Trump’s capture of the Republican nomination. “He should sue whoever did that to his face.”

Two years on, Mr Rubio is plotting a more elevated response to the earthquake Mr Trump has triggered on the right. In an hour-long interview he describes his plan for a new “reform conservative movement” devoted to addressing the economic disruption and social disaffection that the president vigorously described. In offering himself as an optimistic Reaganite, Mr Rubio acknowledges that he missed the “anxiety and anger” Mr Trump tapped into. “I spent a tremendous amount of time focused on the opportunities I had as the son of a bartender and a maid in the past century,” he says. “I didn’t spend nearly enough time talking about what the bartender and the maid face today.”

The details of Mr Rubio’s new programme are unclear, but he suggests they will involve more interventions such as the increased child tax credit he inserted into the tax reform passed last year, and a provision for paid family leave he is working on now. He mulls the need for more public spending on technological research and for education reform, to prioritise vocational skills. He advocates a more flexible benefit system, to help the retraining of disrupted workers. Against the magnitude of America’s income inequality, such measures might seem modest. Yet from the lips of an orthodox Republican leader, they imply a serious reconsideration of the pre-eminent conservative ideals: a minimal government role in the economy and a related view of liberty as “freedom from” government interference. “Government has an essential role to play in buffering this transition,” he says. “If we basically say everyone is on their own and the market’s going to take care of it, we will rip the country apart, because millions of good hardworking people lack the means to adapt.” Economic liberty, in this retelling, becomes something the government is required to guarantee. It is the freedom to enjoy “the dignity of work”, says Mr Rubio. “There needs to be a conservative movement that addresses these realities.”

His implication that Republicans have found no good answer to the problems Mr Trump described is irrefutable. The president’s scheme to revive the 1970s economy through protectionism and deregulation is unrealistic, as Mr Rubio—who these days dares not criticise Mr Trump—cannot help but acknowledge. “The future is going to happen,” he says. “I have no problem with bringing back American car-manufacturing facilities, but, whether they’re American robots or Mexican robots, they’re going to be highly automated.” Most Republican congressmen meanwhile remain entranced by the limited-government shibboleths he has shaken off, as his fight over the tax bill revealed. Mr Rubio’s proposal, to double the tax credit to $2,000 per child and pay for it by making a small increase to the corporate rate his party wanted, was decried by some Republicans as socialism. The watered-down version they accepted, as the price of Mr Rubio’s support for the bill, excluded the poorest families. “There is still a lot of thinking on the right that if big corporations are happy, they’re going to take the money they’re saving and reinvest it in American workers,” he says. “In fact they bought back shares, a few gave out bonuses; there’s no evidence whatsoever that the money’s been massively poured back into the American worker.”

That shows how resistant Mr Rubio’s party will be to the changes he wants. “I’m a minority within a minority,” he says. Yet he is well-able to argue for them. Though not as astute as Ben Sasse or articulate as Ted Cruz, he is an engaging communicator with broad appeal. Social conservatives adore him; pro-life and spikily partisan, he is no mushy centrist. Yet he retains a boyish earnestness that even Democrats find endearing. His golden back-story, as a son of poor immigrants, helps with that—and looks more relevant now than ever. “My relatives are firefighters and nurses and teachers and electricians,” he says. “These are people who are not all that excited about the new economy.”

A big moment for Little Marco

The question, as always with Mr Rubio, is: how serious is he? He has a record of taking enlightened positions—in backing intelligent climate-change policy, for example, and in his more recent support for immigration reform—then ditching them when the wind changes. His pitch also carries hints of that flakiness. He claims to have tempered his erstwhile enthusiasm for trade and immigration; in reality, he has little to say about either. That, in turn, raises another familiar question: is Mr Rubio repudiating Mr Trump or capitulating to him? The timing of his pitch is suspicious. He says his rethink reflects the truths he learned on the trail. But that was over two years ago. It might also be seen as a belated realisation, by a bruised but still-ambitious Republican, that the party of Trump will not return to conservative verities soon.

Even so, that underlines how important it is that Mr Rubio sees this through. He is not the only Republican taking a leaf from the president’s playbook. Yet in contrast to Trump acolytes such as Senator Tom Cotton or Mike Pompeo, the incoming secretary of state, he is unlikely to trace the president’s steps from economic populism to ethno-nationalism. That is not only good in itself. It is also why, having no divisive rhetoric to fall back on, he might try hardest to find solutions to the problems Mr Trump highlighted. It is a lot to expect from a gifted politician with a history of disappointing. But he might be the best hope his party has.",www.economist.com,left,q5kLQj6IV7IOq7Ay

`` My whole life really has been a 'no ' and I fought through it , '' Trump told a crowd in New Hampshire way back in October 2015 . `` It has not been easy for me , it has not been easy for me . And you know I started off in Brooklyn , my father gave me a small loan of a million dollars . ''

While the idea of Trump portraying himself as some sort of rags-to-riches story was always laughable -- his father was a man of considerable means and a $ 1 million loan is not exactly chump change -- it convinced lots and lots of people that Trump was like them . Or , more accurately , what they aspired to be . He was -- and is -- for many , the living embodiment of the American dream .
Which is why this story published by The New York Times on Tuesday night , which details a series of tax evasions that Trump and his father used over the years is so devastating . The piece is long and hugely detailed , but its most devastating lines -- to the idea of the President as , essentially , a self-made man -- are these :
`` By age 3 , Mr. Trump was earning $ 200,000 a year in today 's dollars from his father 's empire . He was a millionaire by age 8 . By the time he was 17 , his father had given him part ownership of a 52-unit apartment building . Soon after Mr. Trump graduated from college , he was receiving the equivalent of $ 1 million a year from his father . The money increased with the years , to more than $ 5 million annually in his 40s and 50s . ''
And remember that $ 1 million loan Trump talked so much about on the campaign trail ? The Times reports that the total loan by Fred Trump to his son , Donald , was actually $ 60.7 million or -- and brace yourself here -- $ 140 million in today 's money . ( The total amount of money Trump received from his father 's holdings is estimated at more than $ 400 million by the Times ) .
The truth , as laid bare by the Times reporting , which included reviewing more than 100,000 pages of financial documents , is that Donald Trump was born into a very wealthy family and through a series of complicated tax maneuvers -- many of which , at best , skirted the law -- was propelled upward by his father 's heavy behind-the-scenes financial support .
`` While Fred Trump helped finance the accouterments of wealth , Donald Trump , master self-promoter , spun them into a seductive narrative , '' reads the Times story . `` Fred Trump 's money , for example , helped build Trump Tower , the talisman of privilege that established his son as a major player in New York . But Donald Trump recognized and exploited the iconic power of Trump Tower as a primary stage for both 'The Apprentice ' and his presidential campaign . ''
While the White House offered no official comment to the Times for the story , they did release a statement after it published . `` Many decades ago the IRS reviewed and signed off on these transactions , '' said White House press secretary Sarah Sanders . `` The New York Times ' and other media outlets ' credibility with the American people is at an all time low because they are consumed with attacking the president and his family 24/7 instead of reporting the news . ''
On Wednesday morning , Trump tweeted , `` The Failing New York Times did something I have never seen done before . They used the concept of 'time value of money ' in doing a very old , boring and often told hit piece on me . Added up , this means that 97 % of their stories on me are bad . Never recovered from bad election call ! ''
Trump 's lawyer Charles Harder responded to the Times story in a statement , '' The New York Times ' allegations of fraud and tax evasion are 100 percent false , and highly defamatory , '' Harder said , according to the paper .
Trump 's brother Robert also defended his parents on behalf of the President and his siblings , saying , `` All appropriate gift and estate tax returns were filed , and the required taxes were paid . Our father 's estate was closed in 2001 by both the Internal Revenue Service and the New York State tax authorities , and our mother 's estate was closed in 2004 . ''
Throughout the 2016 campaign -- and into his 19 months as president -- the single biggest mystery surrounding Trump was his refusal to release any of his income tax returns . In doing so , he became the first major party presidential candidate and the first president not to release any of his returns in the modern era .
Trump insisted the reason he refused to release his returns was that he currently under a tax audit by the Internal Revenue Service . ( Trump was not prohibited from releasing his returns because of the audit ; Richard Nixon , as president , released his tax returns in 1973 even while he was being audited ) .
After Trump won the election , White House counselor Kellyanne Conway seemed to abandon the `` he 's under audit '' defense entirely . `` We litigated this all through the election , '' Conway said . `` People did n't care . They voted for him , and let me make this very clear : Most Americans are very focused on what their tax returns will look like while President Trump is in office , not what his look like . ''
It was unclear then -- and is unclear now -- how Conway drew the conclusions that `` people did n't care '' that Trump had never released even the most basic outline of his tax returns . There was no question on the 2016 exit poll that asked how much influence -- if any -- Trump 's refusal to release his returns had on the vote .
The most recent news we 've had on Trump 's taxes came on Tax Day -- April 17 . `` The President filed an extension for his 2017 tax return , as do many Americans with complex returns , '' Sanders said in a statement at the time . `` He will file his tax return by the extension deadline of October 15 , 2018 .

INSIDE THE MCCAIN-GRAHAM-AYOTTE ALLIANCE : Joining Sen. John McCain and yesterday 's meeting with Rice were his long-time counterpart , Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , who has also been an outspoken critic of Susan Rice 's handling of Benghazi , as well as a fairly new face when it comes to foreign policy : Sen. Kelly Ayotte , R-N.H . In fact , Ayotte has stood by her two more senior Senate colleagues throughout the Rice debacle . ABC New Political Director Amy Walter asked about the McCain-Graham-Ayotte alliance on Twitter last night and got lots of responses suggesting that the two men wanted a female for balance and that the New Hampshire senator was looking for a chance to get some foreign policy credentials to position herself for a 2016 run . And here 's what James Pindell , New Hampshire political expert and WMUR contributor says of her reason for teaming up with the two amigos : `` Kelly Ayotte is dancing with the one who took her to the ball . Outside of the NRSC itself , John McCain was Ayotte 's biggest outside backer in a primary she only won by 1,500 votes against a conservative insurgent and two self-funding millionaires . McCain invited her to Pheonix for a major fundraiser , introduced her to bundlers , and campaigned with her at town hall meetings in New Hampshire , where he is a two time winner of competitive primaries . Ayotte came to the Senate without ever working in Washington before , not even as a hill staffer . She also had never been elected to anything before . She needed others to help her navigate the place and McCain took her under his wing . Because of McCain and Mitt Romney her profile has risen to the point where most Washington pundits can correctly pronounce her name now . ''
POLL : AMONG CLIFF-AVOIDANCE OPTIONS , MOST FAVOR TARGETING THE WEALTHY . With the fiscal cliff drawing closer , raising taxes on wealthy Americans remains a popular option according to the latest ███-Washington Post poll . And , as ABC pollster Gary Langer notes , while the public divides closely on reducing federal income tax deductions , two-thirds oppose another possibility - raising the age for Medicare eligibility . Sixty percent in this new poll support raising taxes on incomes more than $ 250,000 a year , long a popular option overall , but also a divisive one : While 73 percent of Democrats and 63 percent of independents are in favor , far fewer Republicans , 39 percent , agree . Results of this poll echo the national exit poll in the presidential election , in which , given other options , 40 percent of Mitt Romney 's supporters favored raising taxes either on the wealthy ( 28 percent ) or on all Americans ( 12 percent ) . That rose to 79 percent among Obama 's supporters - 66 percent favoring a tax hike on the well-off , 13 percent on everyone . POLL : http : //abcn.ws/UV9jxn
Both Democrats and Republicans are doing lots of posturing and preening as the clock ticks down to the Dec. 31 fiscal cliff deadline , but Congressional insiders say at this stage , the game right now is all about hurry-up-and-wait .
Brad Dayspring , the former communications director for Rep. Eric Cantor . R-Va. , and current director of Young Guns Action Network , cautions that we should n't expect to see any real work to get done until the week of December 10 .
And most veteran Capitol Hill watchers we talk to do n't expect to see a deal reached until right before Christmas . In fact , many others who are less optimistic expect to ring in the New Year in the Capitol .
It should n't come as a shock . If there 's one thing we know about Congress it 's this : Nothing gets done until the very last minute .
Former Wyoming Republican Sen. Alan K. Simpson , who co-chaired a 2010 bi-partisan fiscal commission , predicted exactly that yesterday .
`` They 're going to react right down to the last point when there 's going to be blood and hair and eyeballs all over the floor and they 're going to come up with something , '' Simpson said in an interview on Tuesday MSNBC 's `` Hardball , '' `` but let me tell you , if it 's just kicking the can down the road , the can is now a 55 gallon drum filled with explosives . You ca n't play that game anymore . ''
As The New York Times ' Jackie Calmes writes this morning , Simpson and his Democratic counterpart , Erskine Bowles , `` have been on the road , sometimes solo but often together , perfecting a sort of Off Broadway show that has kept their panel 's recommendations alive . '' http : //nyti.ms/VdAuY9
Today Bowles plans to meet privately with House Speaker John Boehner and key Republicans leaders on Capitol Hill .
An eleventh hour deal is nothing new in Washington . As The Hill 's Russell Berman and Erik Wasson noted , `` For the fourth consecutive year , a major Washington negotiation is on a collision course with Christmas '' :
`` In 2009 , the Senate stayed in session until the early morning of Christmas Eve to pass an initial version of the healthcare overhaul . The next year , Congress gave final approval to a lame-duck tax package on Dec. 16 , and in 2011 , House Republicans held out until Dec. 23 before approving - by unanimous consent - a two-month extension of a payroll tax cut . '' http : //bit.ly/WVd4qG
SIMPSON-BOWLES ' SECOND STAR TURN . More from The New York Times ' Jackie Calmes on the efforts of Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson to keep alive the two-year-old work of their debt commission : `` That so many people from Bellevue , Wash. , to Sanibel Island , Fla. , and from Waterville , Me. , to Dana Point , Calif. , talk about 'Simpson-Bowles ' ( or 'Bowles-Simpson ' ) as if it is shorthand for the solution to the nation 's fiscal woes - even though few know its devilish details on tax increases and spending cuts - is testament to the men 's indefatigable efforts . … On Tuesday , Mr. Bowles and corporate executives he helped recruit to a `` Fix the Debt '' campaign met privately at the White House with six senior administration officials , including Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner . The commission 's report 'could have just been put into the dustbin , ' said David M. Cote , the chief executive of Honeywell and a panel member . 'Instead , ' Mr. Cote added , 'it 's become the basis for all of this discussion . ' '' http : //nyti.ms/VdAuY9

Ayotte said that in yesterday 's meeting Rice called the information she first gave to the American people wrong . `` It 's certainly clear from the beginning that we knew that those with ties to al Qaeda were involved in the attack on the embassy , and clearly the impression that was given , the information given to the American people , was wrong , '' Ayotte said . http : //abcn.ws/Sck1iE
NOTED : RICE RESPONDS . in a statement following the meeting Susan Rice said : `` We explained that the talking points provided by the intelligence community , and the initial assessment upon which they were based , were incorrect in a key respect : There was no protest or demonstration in Benghazi . While , we certainly wish that we had had perfect information just days after the terrorist attack , as is often the case , the intelligence assessment has evolved .

NOTABLES:

SUSAN RICE VS. THE GOP: After a face-to-face meeting on Capitol Hill yesterday, GOP Senators including John McCain clashed once again with U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice over what she said about the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya in the days that followed. ABC's Jonathan Karl reported for ""Good Morning America"" today that sources inside the meeting say Rice acknowledged that some of what she said publicly after the attack turned out not to be true, but that she was presenting evidence that came directly from the Central Intelligence Agency. The Senators responded by accusing both her and the CIA of covering up the truth about the attack for political reasons - a charge that Rice forcefully denied, as did acting CIA director Mike Morell, who also attended the meeting. WATCH: http://abcn.ws/Tl43l1

INSIDE THE MCCAIN-GRAHAM-AYOTTE ALLIANCE: Joining Sen. John McCain and yesterday's meeting with Rice were his long-time counterpart, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who has also been an outspoken critic of Susan Rice's handling of Benghazi, as well as a fairly new face when it comes to foreign policy: Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H. In fact, Ayotte has stood by her two more senior Senate colleagues throughout the Rice debacle. ABC New Political Director Amy Walter asked about the McCain-Graham-Ayotte alliance on Twitter last night and got lots of responses suggesting that the two men wanted a female for balance and that the New Hampshire senator was looking for a chance to get some foreign policy credentials to position herself for a 2016 run. And here's what James Pindell, New Hampshire political expert and WMUR contributor says of her reason for teaming up with the two amigos: ""Kelly Ayotte is dancing with the one who took her to the ball. Outside of the NRSC itself, John McCain was Ayotte's biggest outside backer in a primary she only won by 1,500 votes against a conservative insurgent and two self-funding millionaires. McCain invited her to Pheonix for a major fundraiser, introduced her to bundlers, and campaigned with her at town hall meetings in New Hampshire, where he is a two time winner of competitive primaries. Ayotte came to the Senate without ever working in Washington before, not even as a hill staffer. She also had never been elected to anything before. She needed others to help her navigate the place and McCain took her under his wing. Because of McCain and Mitt Romney her profile has risen to the point where most Washington pundits can correctly pronounce her name now.""

HELP WANTED - TOP CABINET VACANCIES ABOUND: Susan Rice she has told people that she has no idea whether or not President Obama will nominate her to succeed Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State. And friends of Clinton say that they expect her to leave immediately after the President's first term is over in early January. But Secretary of State is not the only critical cabinet vacancy. In addition to the opening at the CIA as a result of Petraeus's resignation, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta is also expected to leave. ABC's Martha Raddatz noted on ""Good Morning America,"" that all of these vacancies are happening at a critical time when there are a lot of hot spots bubbling up. Iran is trying to acquire a nuclear weapon, there are new satellite photos showing North Korea would like to try to test another long range ballistic missile, and it's a critical time in Afghanistan as the administration attempts to put together plans for what the U.S. does there after 2014. WATCH: http://abcn.ws/SdycE8

POLL: AMONG CLIFF-AVOIDANCE OPTIONS, MOST FAVOR TARGETING THE WEALTHY. With the fiscal cliff drawing closer, raising taxes on wealthy Americans remains a popular option according to the latest ABC News-Washington Post poll. And, as ABC pollster Gary Langer notes, while the public divides closely on reducing federal income tax deductions, two-thirds oppose another possibility - raising the age for Medicare eligibility. Sixty percent in this new poll support raising taxes on incomes more than $250,000 a year, long a popular option overall, but also a divisive one: While 73 percent of Democrats and 63 percent of independents are in favor, far fewer Republicans, 39 percent, agree. Results of this poll echo the national exit poll in the presidential election, in which, given other options, 40 percent of Mitt Romney's supporters favored raising taxes either on the wealthy (28 percent) or on all Americans (12 percent). That rose to 79 percent among Obama's supporters - 66 percent favoring a tax hike on the well-off, 13 percent on everyone. POLL: http://abcn.ws/UV9jxn

THE NOTE:

Both Democrats and Republicans are doing lots of posturing and preening as the clock ticks down to the Dec. 31 fiscal cliff deadline, but Congressional insiders say at this stage, the game right now is all about hurry-up-and-wait.

Brad Dayspring, the former communications director for Rep. Eric Cantor. R-Va., and current director of Young Guns Action Network, cautions that we shouldn't expect to see any real work to get done until the week of December 10.

And most veteran Capitol Hill watchers we talk to don't expect to see a deal reached until right before Christmas. In fact, many others who are less optimistic expect to ring in the New Year in the Capitol.

It shouldn't come as a shock. If there's one thing we know about Congress it's this: Nothing gets done until the very last minute.

Former Wyoming Republican Sen. Alan K. Simpson, who co-chaired a 2010 bi-partisan fiscal commission, predicted exactly that yesterday.

""They're going to react right down to the last point when there's going to be blood and hair and eyeballs all over the floor and they're going to come up with something,"" Simpson said in an interview on Tuesday MSNBC's ""Hardball,"" ""but let me tell you, if it's just kicking the can down the road, the can is now a 55 gallon drum filled with explosives. You can't play that game anymore.""

As The New York Times' Jackie Calmes writes this morning, Simpson and his Democratic counterpart, Erskine Bowles, ""have been on the road, sometimes solo but often together, perfecting a sort of Off Broadway show that has kept their panel's recommendations alive."" http://nyti.ms/VdAuY9

Today Bowles plans to meet privately with House Speaker John Boehner and key Republicans leaders on Capitol Hill.

An eleventh hour deal is nothing new in Washington. As The Hill's Russell Berman and Erik Wasson noted, ""For the fourth consecutive year, a major Washington negotiation is on a collision course with Christmas"":

""In 2009, the Senate stayed in session until the early morning of Christmas Eve to pass an initial version of the healthcare overhaul.

More from The New York Times' Jackie Calmes on the efforts of Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson to keep alive the two-year-old work of their debt commission: ""That so many people from Bellevue, Wash., to Sanibel Island, Fla., and from Waterville, Me., to Dana Point, Calif., talk about 'Simpson-Bowles' (or 'Bowles-Simpson') as if it is shorthand for the solution to the nation's fiscal woes - even though few know its devilish details on tax increases and spending cuts - is testament to the men's indefatigable efforts. … On Tuesday, Mr. Bowles and corporate executives he helped recruit to a ""Fix the Debt"" campaign met privately at the White House with six senior administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Timothy F.

Our tax code needs to be reformed because it’s a mess, and Congress created it.

As Congress gets down to the task of reforming the tax code, I find myself asking: Why is this necessary?

No doubt, tax reform is necessary. Our tax code is a mess, to say the least. But why is it a mess? The answer, at bottom, has to be Congress itself. The legislature is solely responsible for setting tax rates, exemptions, and deductions. It is therefore reforming a tax code that it alone deformed.

To put it bluntly, Congress is not well suited for national economic planning, which is basically what pro-growth tax policies boil down to. As a matter of fact, Congress outsources a lot of economic planning — like environmental regulation — to the bureaucracy, because it knows it is not capable of handling such matters for itself. It keeps tax policy within the legislature primarily because that doubles as a way to distribute political benefits to key constituencies.

The problem is an institutional one. It is really not accurate to say that Congress is a “national legislature,” for there is no member in either chamber who is elected by the nation at large. Instead, it is the meeting place of representatives of discrete geographical constituencies. This inclines the legislature to parochial concerns rather than national ones — a tendency that is exacerbated by the fact that senators are apportioned equally among the states, regardless of population. Moreover, our campaign-finance system, whereby those who contribute most to political campaigns are those with pressing business before the Congress, gives each member of Congress yet another incentive to view policy problems from the perspective of a very small slice of the nation.

This design made sense when the Constitution was ratified, when there was little expectation that Congress would take charge of planning or directing the national economy. And indeed, seeing as how this was still a generation before the Industrial Revolution really began in the United States, there was little by way of an economy to plan. GDP in 1790 was just $5 billion in today’s dollars.

If you look at the relatively narrow set of congressional powers enumerated by the Constitution, you will not see any clause that specifically sanctions promoting national economic development. Congress had to read between the lines to acquire that authority.

In the Report on Manufactures, submitted in 1791, Alexander Hamilton argued that Congress’s power to “lay and collect taxes . . . to provide for the common defense and general Welfare of the United States” validated his ambitious plan of national development. However, his political opponents thought he was grossly misreading what was originally intended to be an anodyne statement. And the matter was left at that, more or less, for another 20 years.

Though the means of congressional planning have changed — the tariff is out, the income tax is in — the final result is as maddening as ever.

It was only after the War of 1812 that Congress began to take seriously the need for economic planning. The primary tool for this task was the protective tariff, intended to stimulate domestic industry by shielding it from competition abroad, particularly Great Britain. Yet it was not long before the tariff devolved into a regional logroll, aiding the North and West at the expensive of the South, which is what brought about the first threat of secession. The Tariff of 1828, often called the Tariff of Abominations, was, according to historian George Dangerfield, “an undisguised hunt for special advantages,” demonstrating that “the central government was expected to give assistance, but never to plan the assistance that it gave.”

As the 19th century wore on, the protective tariff took root in American political life. Arguably, it facilitated economic development in the early phases of the Industrial Revolution, but by the end of the century its purpose was predominantly political. Republican politicians used it to reward the industrial magnates who financed their campaigns, win the votes of the working class, and even buy off the Civil War veterans. The tariff produced a massive surplus in revenue, which was appropriated for ever- generous pensions for Union soldiers.

The tariff regime fell apart during the Great Depression, when the Republican-dominated Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930. This law made manifest all the flaws inherent to legislative planning of the economy. Originally intended to offer added protection for industries in the midst of economic decline, it became the most obscene logroll in congressional history. The Depression worsened thereafter, free trade became the new aspiration, and economic planners turned to the income-tax code.

Though the means of congressional planning have changed — the tariff is out, the income tax is in — the final result is as maddening as ever. The income-tax code is such a complicated morass that Americans spent 1.35 billion hours on their taxes in 2012, and spent $20 billion on compliance costs alone.

This is a consequence of that old parochial imperative inherent to Congress. The late Barber Conable, ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee, called it the “ABC Syndrome”:

Suppose that someone — a business person, a wage earner, or a retired person approaches his or her representative in Congress and says, in effect: “What you have done in the tax system is fundamentally all right, but I have a very unusual situation, you see, and it is not fair for me to have to be taxed this way just because my neighbor thinks it is all right.” Suppose further that the member of Congress looks at the matter and agrees with the taxpayer, called “A.” The member takes the case to the Committee on Ways and Means, and the committee also finds that “A” is, indeed, in a different situation and should be treated differently, i.e., more fairly. So, “A” gets an exception in the tax code — an exception that fits all the other “A’s” who are similarly situated. A year or so passes and along comes taxpayer “B,” who tells Congress: “What you did for ‘A’ was good. It is an appropriate exception. But I am situated a little differently and what you did for ‘A’ is having an adverse effect on me. Please take a look and see if you don’t agree.” Of course, Congress does agree, and provides an exception to the exception in order to take care of “B.” Then, about a year later, taxpayer “C” approaches Congress, and you know what happens. An exception to the exception to the exception for “C.”

This is no way to plan an economy! Still, Congress really cannot help itself, because the Framers never really intended it to plan an economy in the first place.

So the need for tax reform is a good illustration of the limits of Congress as an institution. It shows what happens when people expect a government initially designed for limited purposes to take on an expansive, nearly limitless portfolio. The ABC Syndrome is part of the congressional DNA, and will always undermine the grand ambitions of our would-be national planners.

President Barack Obama called Monday for Congress to pass an extension of Bush-era tax cuts for household incomes less than $ 250,000 in the coming weeks , and to leave a debate on whether to extend the cuts to the rich until after the presidential election in November .
“ The Republicans say they don ’ t want to raise taxes on the middle class , and I don ’ t want to raise taxes on the middle class , so we should all agree to extend the tax cut for the middle class .

Though Monday ’ s announcement was an official statement of White House policy , it dovetailed with the Obama campaign ’ s push to paint Romney as out of touch and supportive of policies that favor the rich .
“ Pass a bill extending the tax cuts for the middle class , I will sign it tomorrow . Pass it next week , I ’ ll sign it next week , ” Obama said . “ Right now , our priority needs to be giving middle-class Americans and small businesses the security they deserve . ”

On 23 September 1952, vice presidential candidate Richard Nixon gave a speech laying out ""everything I have earned, everything I have spent and everything I own"".

He concluded by challenging the Democratic candidate for president, Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson, to do the same. Governor Stevenson took the challenge one step further, releasing his personal tax returns - the clearest account of an individual's income for the year.

The move was not reciprocated by Nixon or his running mate for president, Dwight Eisenhower.

Two decades later though, at the height of the Watergate scandal and under audit by the US tax authority - the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) - then-President Nixon made his tax returns public in hopes of clearing the air.

The move did not work, but it set a precedent for making tax filings public.

""It's proof you have nothing to hide,"" says Joe Thorndike, a tax historian at Tax Analyst.

Donald Trump says he needs no such proof.

Claiming to face his own audit the presumptive Republican nominee has refused to release his tax returns, even as public pressure mounts for him to do so.

Every US presidential candidate since 1976 has released their tax returns, but there is no law requiring it.

What's in the returns?

Mr Trump's refusal to release them has led to mounting speculation about what he could possibly be hiding.

""Tax returns are sort of black and white and you sign your name to say this is accurate. It's not open to interpretation,"" says Mr Thorndike.

The first thing the public would find is what tax rate Mr Trump pays. The candidate has bragged about paying a very low tax rate and taking advantage of the complex US tax code with its many loopholes.

""Mr Trump is proud to pay a lower tax rate, the lowest tax rate possible,"" one of his top aides has said.

It's possible his returns may hold similar bombshells, but Mr Trump's admission that he does his best to avoid taxes will likely make these less explosive.

Net worth

One line of thinking has it that the returns would give a better sense of how much Mr Trump is worth. The New York billionaire has given several different figures for his net worth, which have all been higher than estimates by financial experts and publications like Forbes magazine.

But discovering whether Mr Trump is inflating his net worth may not be as easy as some hope from his tax returns.

Tax forms focus on income for the year, not total worth.

It may be possible to tell how much income Donald Trump made in a given year, but the complex way his companies earn money will still make this difficult. US real estate professionals can take tax losses based on the depreciation and other expenses for their buildings. This could allow Mr Trump to report having less income and therefore place him in a lower tax bracket.

Business sense

While we may not get an exact number for Mr Trump's wealth, it is likely the returns would give a more detailed picture of his businesses.

The forms would show how much profit and loss the companies he owns distributed to him in a year. It would not give a full account of the worth of those businesses because not all profit is distributed to the owners - some is put back in to grow the business - but it would give a sense of the activity.

One thing a tax return would definitely show is how much Mr Trump gives to charity.

Americans are allowed to deduct charitable donations of over $250 (£170) from their tax bill. If the real estate mogul donated as much as he claimed, it should appear on his tax deductions form.

Scandals

Mr Trump has said he will release the returns after the audit, but doing so before would hurt his interaction with the IRS.

The New York Times has delivered two major investigative scoops — unearthing tax documents filed by Trump ’ s father and some documents filed by Trump himself , mostly in the 1980s — that explain how Trump became rich in the first place while paying remarkably little in taxes to the Treasury Department .
Everything the Times has found so far is much too old to be the basis for any present-day criminal charges , or even to shed any real light on the current state of Trump ’ s business operations . The documents do , however , indicate that Trump has been lying to the public about several significant matters , including , most notably , the extent to which his wealth is simply inherited rather than the result of business prowess .
They also indicate some potentially illegal activity as Fred Trump sought to pass wealth tax-free to Donald and his siblings . The statute of limitations has passed , however , and Trump ’ s sister , a federal judge , abruptly retired in February , ensuring there would be no judicial ethics investigation either .
Trump ’ s returns also dramatize the extent to which the current policy paradigm in the United States in effect lets the rich and powerful steal money from the Treasury , with limited odds of detection or consequences .
All of this , in other words , is very important and interesting , and it shouldn ’ t just be glossed over in the daily to-and-fro of politics . But equally important is to understand what these scoops don ’ t tell us but what complying with congressional demands would : Who is paying Trump right now , and what , if anything , are they getting in return ?
On Tuesday evening , the Times published a blockbuster report from Ross Buettner and Susanne Craig based on returns that Trump filed from 1985 to 1994 . The IRS had made anonymized returns from the highest earners in America during that time available for public study , and the Times reporters spoke to an anonymous source who had legal access to Trump ’ s returns . The source told the Times a few key facts about what the returns said , and that allowed the reporters to identify which of the anonymous , publicly available returns were Trump ’ s — making it possible to analyze them .
This is a somewhat controversial reporting technique , since anonymized IRS data is a very useful tool for academic research that the agency has tended to be fairly stingy with for privacy reasons . The fact that the Times has shown a viable journalistic path to de-anonymizing the data makes it likely that the IRS will be even more hesitant to release such information in the future .
The big headline conclusion of analyzing the returns , though , is that over this 10-year period , Trump reported more than $ 1 billion in business income losses , allowing him to pay no federal income tax for eight of the 10 years , despite his obviously high standard of living .
One takeaway is that , despite his braggadocio , Trump was not , in fact , a successful business leader early in his career . While his father made a lot of money in the not particularly glamorous business of building and operating apartment buildings in Brooklyn and Queens , Trump went big into the Atlantic City casino business . This ended in multiple rounds of bankruptcy , from which Trump only recovered by first ripping off mom-and-pop equity investors in the 1990s and then later by reinventing himself as a reality television star .
However , as Josh Barro writes at New York magazine , it seems inconceivable that Trump actually lost $ 1 billion himself , simply because ( as we will see later ) he never had $ 1 billion to lose .
“ The primary lesson of Trump ’ s massive reported losses from 1985 to 1994 is not that he was a comically bad businessman , ” writes Barro , “ but that he was comically undertaxed . ”
Trump himself would like you to believe that this was all just standard rich-guy tax sheltering , and said as much on Twitter Wednesday morning .
.... you would get it by building , or even buying . You always wanted to show losses for tax purposes .... almost all real estate developers did - and often re-negotiate with banks , it was sport . Additionally , the very old information put out is a highly inaccurate Fake News hit job ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) May 8 , 2019
One problem with this , however , is that Trump was clearly an outlier .
For several of the years in question , Trump reported larger losses than any other person in the United States . And in 1990 and 1991 , Trump ’ s reported losses were double the losses that anyone else reported to the IRS . It ’ s certainly possible that Trump and his team of lawyers and accountants were simply a lot more clever than anyone else working in the tax field . But it ’ s also possible nobody else was claiming losses on this scale because there was no actual legal way to do so , and Trump just happened to get away with it .
At a minimum , based on a separate Times scoop , we have some pretty good evidence that Trump got away with skirting the rules around gift and estate taxes .
The earlier scoop , also by the Times , was focused on tax returns filed by Donald Trump ’ s father , Fred .
The headline conclusion of this exposé was that Trump had been lying over the years about the extent of the financial assistance he received from his dad . Trump has consistently portrayed himself as a self-made man who was helped out by a “ small ” $ 1 million loan from his father . The Times revealed that he in fact benefited from over $ 200 million ( more than $ 400 million in inflation-adjusted dollars ) in wealth transfers from his dad , some of which was inheritance , some of which was gifts , and some of which — crucially — was an awfully illegal-sounding scheme .
Fred Trump set up his children in 1992 as the owners of a company called All County Building Supply & Maintenance , which sold boilers , refrigerators , cleaning supplies , and other equipment at unusually high prices to buildings owned by Fred Trump . On its face , this looks a lot like an illegal effort to evade gift and estate tax by masking a wealth transfer as a business transaction . What ’ s more , Fred Trump then compounded the offense because the buildings in question were rent-regulated and he cited the high prices paid as legal justification for rent increases .
If this loophole is actually legal , then it ’ s difficult to understand why anyone should ever pay estate taxes . Rather than leaving $ 1 billion to your heir , you could purchase a pair of socks from your heir for $ 1 billion and call it a business transaction .
Fred got away with it at the time , however , and by the time the Times published the information , the statute of limitations had expired .
Some shrewd people noticed , however , that there is no statute of limitations on judicial ethics investigations and filed a complaint against Trump ’ s sister Maryanne , who until recently was a federal appeals court judge . This would have launched an investigation of her that could , were she found guilty of wrongdoing , have implicated the president as well . But she cut the investigation short by retiring as soon as court officials announced that they were going to look into the complaint .
The Trump family has thus seemingly avoided legal accountability for the scam simply because this went down almost 30 years ago . But it raises the possibility that Trump is trying to keep his more recent returns hidden for the slightly banal reason that he ’ s been getting away with cheating on his taxes and doesn ’ t think his returns can bear public scrutiny .
A totally unrelated shady thing the Times found in Trump ’ s tax returns from the 1980s is that he used to parlay his celebrity status into a kind of pump-and-dump stock scam .
He would secretly buy shares of stock in a company , publicly suggest he was planning to make a bid to buy the whole company , watch the share price rise in response to the Trump takeover rumors , and then sell his shares at a profit without actually doing anything .
He did this successfully with United Airlines in 1987 , which led him to try it again with Hilton Hotels , Gillette , and Federated Department Stores in 1988 . This was apparently a “ fool me five times , shame on you ” situation , however ; investors caught on to the fact that Trump was running a scam , and it didn ’ t work anymore . Around the same time , the Securities and Exchange Commission hit Trump with a $ 750,000 fine related to a different stock transaction — one of several instances of Trump being caught breaking the rules only to be allowed to settle charges with a fine and no admission of guilt .
As president , Trump every once in a while throws global financial markets into a tizzy with unexpected tweets threatening tariffs and trade wars . It would be interesting to know how those market convulsions affect Trump ’ s finances , but of course we can ’ t tell because he ’ s keeping his returns secret .
Separately , the Times report on Fred Trump ’ s taxes sheds further light on a seemingly illegal aspect of Trump ’ s casino businesses . In 1990 , Fred sent a man named Howard Snyder to Donald Trump ’ s Atlantic City casino with a $ 3.35 million check , which Snyder used to buy casino chips . He left the casino without even hitting the craps table . That money was , in effect , an untaxed gift from father to son . This led , at the time , to a $ 30,000 fine because the transaction violated New Jersey casino law , but the Times ’ s reporting revealed an additional tax evasion angle .
All this information , however , is at least 25 years old . Congress is after more recent information that could shed light on a range of other questions .
Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code was written in 1924 , and on a plain reading , the statutory language gives the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee ( and the chair of the counterpart committee in the Senate ) authority to obtain any person ’ s tax returns for any reason .
The specific statutory language does not limit this authority in any way , or give the Treasury secretary any discretion over whether to comply with the request .
Upon written request from the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives , the chairman of the Committee on Finance of the Senate , or the chairman of the Joint Committee on Taxation , the Secretary shall furnish such committee with any return or return information specified in such request , except that any return or return information which can be associated with , or otherwise identify , directly or indirectly , a particular taxpayer shall be furnished to such committee only when sitting in closed executive session unless such taxpayer otherwise consents in writing to such disclosure .
As George Yin , a former chief of staff to the Joint Committee on Taxation and current professor at the University of Virginia , explained in February congressional testimony , the historical context is that in the 1920s , the president “ had unconditional access to tax returns ” and consequently that “ Congress wanted to give its committees the same right . ”
Both the White House and the Treasury Department are , however , brazenly refusing to follow the law .
This is going to end up in court , and Trump will probably lose at some point . But if Democrats are able to get the president ’ s tax returns , there is debate over whether they can legally be made public .
Even if the Ways and Means Committee gets Trump ’ s tax returns the easy way , it could then vote to have some or all of the tax returns released to the rest of the House of Representatives , so all members would have access to it . But then it ’ s unclear if it ’ s legal to make that information public . They would have to go through a lengthy court battle even before they get to that step .
Ken Kies , the managing director of the lobbyist Federal Policy Group , testified before Congress in February that it would be a felony for a member of Congress or staff to publicly disclose tax returns , punishable for up to five years in prison . Others , however , disagreed . Yin argued that if the committee votes to release them to the full House , making the tax returns public would be allowed .
In other words , the drama may continue for quite a while . Only Trump knows what the actual stakes are , but it ’ s possible to get a sense of what the key issues may be based on what we do know .
Given that Trump is currently serving as president of the United States , the most obvious thing his tax returns would tell us is who is paying him money .
Recently , for example , the mayor of Baltimore resigned after it turned out that she was selling bulk copies of her book , Healthy Holly , to entities that had contracts with the city of Baltimore . Trump ’ s sprawling and opaque empire of businesses creates many opportunities for wealthy individuals , business enterprises , and foreign governments with an interest in American public policy to deliver money to the president of the United States . We know broadly that many such businesses and governments have been booking events at Trump ’ s hotel in Washington , DC , in an effort to curry favor with him .
But we have no real idea what the full extent of Trump ’ s business dealings are or who they are with . Tax returns would not fully or satisfactorily answer these questions , but they would shed a good deal of light on them .
What ’ s more , in the tax returns that we have seen , there are several instances of what could be illegal tax evasion — tax evasion that won ’ t be fully investigated because the statute of limitations has passed . It ’ s certainly possible that at some point in the past 25 years , Trump cleaned up his act . The reality , however , is that IRS enforcement of rich people ’ s tax evasion has gotten substantially laxer in recent years , thanks to Republican budget cuts . A rational tax cheat , in other words , would be more aggressive in recent years than he was in the 1980s and early 1990s , and we know that Trump was very aggressive back then .
But beyond these two big known unknowns of tax evasion and bribery , there are a lot of unknown unknowns . The United Airlines pump-and-dump scheme isn ’ t necessarily something anyone would specifically think to look into — it just emerged from examining his returns . It ’ s clear that Trump was pretty bad at managing casinos , but across the long span of his career , he ’ s also proven himself to be extremely flexible , capable , and opportunistic in terms of coming up with moneymaking schemes .
But for all his celebrity over the years , we simply don ’ t know all that much about what those schemes were — or who any victims might be — and tax returns are one of the best ways to find out .","We’re starting to get at least a partial picture of what Donald Trump has been trying to hide since ducking releasing his tax returns during the 2016 campaign and then sidestepping demands from Democrats in Congress to see them.

Trump claimed $1 billion in tax losses

On Tuesday evening, the Times published a blockbuster report from Ross Buettner and Susanne Craig based on returns that Trump filed from 1985 to 1994. The IRS had made anonymized returns from the highest earners in America during that time available for public study, and the Times reporters spoke to an anonymous source who had legal access to Trump’s returns.

The fact that the Times has shown a viable journalistic path to de-anonymizing the data makes it likely that the IRS will be even more hesitant to release such information in the future.

The big headline conclusion of analyzing the returns, though, is that over this 10-year period, Trump reported more than $1 billion in business income losses, allowing him to pay no federal income tax for eight of the 10 years, despite his obviously high standard of living.

Trump himself would like you to believe that this was all just standard rich-guy tax sheltering, and said as much on Twitter Wednesday morning.

....you would get it by building, or even buying. You always wanted to show losses for tax purposes....almost all real estate developers did - and often re-negotiate with banks, it was sport. Additionally, the very old information put out is a highly inaccurate Fake News hit job! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2019

One problem with this, however, is that Trump was clearly an outlier.

For several of the years in question, Trump reported larger losses than any other person in the United States. And in 1990 and 1991, Trump’s reported losses were double the losses that anyone else reported to the IRS. It’s certainly possible that Trump and his team of lawyers and accountants were simply a lot more clever than anyone else working in the tax field. But it’s also possible nobody else was claiming losses on this scale because there was no actual legal way to do so, and Trump just happened to get away with it.

At a minimum, based on a separate Times scoop, we have some pretty good evidence that Trump got away with skirting the rules around gift and estate taxes.

The All County Building Supply & Maintenance scam

The earlier scoop, also by the Times, was focused on tax returns filed by Donald Trump’s father, Fred.

The headline conclusion of this exposé was that Trump had been lying over the years about the extent of the financial assistance he received from his dad. Trump has consistently portrayed himself as a self-made man who was helped out by a “small” $1 million loan from his father. The Times revealed that he in fact benefited from over $200 million (more than $400 million in inflation-adjusted dollars) in wealth transfers from his dad, some of which was inheritance, some of which was gifts, and some of which — crucially — was an awfully illegal-sounding scheme.

Fred Trump set up his children in 1992 as the owners of a company called All County Building Supply & Maintenance, which sold boilers, refrigerators, cleaning supplies, and other equipment at unusually high prices to buildings owned by Fred Trump. On its face, this looks a lot like an illegal effort to evade gift and estate tax by masking a wealth transfer as a business transaction. What’s more, Fred Trump then compounded the offense because the buildings in question were rent-regulated and he cited the high prices paid as legal justification for rent increases.

If this loophole is actually legal, then it’s difficult to understand why anyone should ever pay estate taxes. Rather than leaving $1 billion to your heir, you could purchase a pair of socks from your heir for $1 billion and call it a business transaction.

Fred got away with it at the time, however, and by the time the Times published the information, the statute of limitations had expired.

Some shrewd people noticed, however, that there is no statute of limitations on judicial ethics investigations and filed a complaint against Trump’s sister Maryanne, who until recently was a federal appeals court judge. This would have launched an investigation of her that could, were she found guilty of wrongdoing, have implicated the president as well. But she cut the investigation short by retiring as soon as court officials announced that they were going to look into the complaint.

The Trump family has thus seemingly avoided legal accountability for the scam simply because this went down almost 30 years ago. But it raises the possibility that Trump is trying to keep his more recent returns hidden for the slightly banal reason that he’s been getting away with cheating on his taxes and doesn’t think his returns can bear public scrutiny.

We’ve learned a few other embarrassing things

A totally unrelated shady thing the Times found in Trump’s tax returns from the 1980s is that he used to parlay his celebrity status into a kind of pump-and-dump stock scam.

He would secretly buy shares of stock in a company, publicly suggest he was planning to make a bid to buy the whole company, watch the share price rise in response to the Trump takeover rumors, and then sell his shares at a profit without actually doing anything.

He did this successfully with United Airlines in 1987, which led him to try it again with Hilton Hotels, Gillette, and Federated Department Stores in 1988. This was apparently a “fool me five times, shame on you” situation, however; investors caught on to the fact that Trump was running a scam, and it didn’t work anymore. Around the same time, the Securities and Exchange Commission hit Trump with a $750,000 fine related to a different stock transaction — one of several instances of Trump being caught breaking the rules only to be allowed to settle charges with a fine and no admission of guilt.

As president, Trump every once in a while throws global financial markets into a tizzy with unexpected tweets threatening tariffs and trade wars. It would be interesting to know how those market convulsions affect Trump’s finances, but of course we can’t tell because he’s keeping his returns secret.

Separately, the Times report on Fred Trump’s taxes sheds further light on a seemingly illegal aspect of Trump’s casino businesses. In 1990, Fred sent a man named Howard Snyder to Donald Trump’s Atlantic City casino with a $3.35 million check, which Snyder used to buy casino chips. He left the casino without even hitting the craps table. That money was, in effect, an untaxed gift from father to son. This led, at the time, to a $30,000 fine because the transaction violated New Jersey casino law, but the Times’s reporting revealed an additional tax evasion angle.

All this information, however, is at least 25 years old. Congress is after more recent information that could shed light on a range of other questions.

Congress wants Trump’s tax returns

Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code was written in 1924, and on a plain reading, the statutory language gives the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee (and the chair of the counterpart committee in the Senate) authority to obtain any person’s tax returns for any reason.

The specific statutory language does not limit this authority in any way, or give the Treasury secretary any discretion over whether to comply with the request.

Upon written request from the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, the chairman of the Committee on Finance of the Senate, or the chairman of the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Secretary shall furnish such committee with any return or return information specified in such request, except that any return or return information which can be associated with, or otherwise identify, directly or indirectly, a particular taxpayer shall be furnished to such committee only when sitting in closed executive session unless such taxpayer otherwise consents in writing to such disclosure.

As George Yin, a former chief of staff to the Joint Committee on Taxation and current professor at the University of Virginia, explained in February congressional testimony, the historical context is that in the 1920s, the president “had unconditional access to tax returns” and consequently that “Congress wanted to give its committees the same right.”

Both the White House and the Treasury Department are, however, brazenly refusing to follow the law.

This is going to end up in court, and Trump will probably lose at some point. But if Democrats are able to get the president’s tax returns, there is debate over whether they can legally be made public.

Even if the Ways and Means Committee gets Trump’s tax returns the easy way, it could then vote to have some or all of the tax returns released to the rest of the House of Representatives, so all members would have access to it. But then it’s unclear if it’s legal to make that information public. They would have to go through a lengthy court battle even before they get to that step.

Ken Kies, the managing director of the lobbyist Federal Policy Group, testified before Congress in February that it would be a felony for a member of Congress or staff to publicly disclose tax returns, punishable for up to five years in prison. Others, however, disagreed. Yin argued that if the committee votes to release them to the full House, making the tax returns public would be allowed.

In other words, the drama may continue for quite a while. Only Trump knows what the actual stakes are, but it’s possible to get a sense of what the key issues may be based on what we do know.

The known unknowns of Trump’s finances

Given that Trump is currently serving as president of the United States, the most obvious thing his tax returns would tell us is who is paying him money.

Recently, for example, the mayor of Baltimore resigned after it turned out that she was selling bulk copies of her book, Healthy Holly, to entities that had contracts with the city of Baltimore. Trump’s sprawling and opaque empire of businesses creates many opportunities for wealthy individuals, business enterprises, and foreign governments with an interest in American public policy to deliver money to the president of the United States. We know broadly that many such businesses and governments have been booking events at Trump’s hotel in Washington, DC, in an effort to curry favor with him.

But we have no real idea what the full extent of Trump’s business dealings are or who they are with. Tax returns would not fully or satisfactorily answer these questions, but they would shed a good deal of light on them.

What’s more, in the tax returns that we have seen, there are several instances of what could be illegal tax evasion — tax evasion that won’t be fully investigated because the statute of limitations has passed. It’s certainly possible that at some point in the past 25 years, Trump cleaned up his act. The reality, however, is that IRS enforcement of rich people’s tax evasion has gotten substantially laxer in recent years, thanks to Republican budget cuts. A rational tax cheat, in other words, would be more aggressive in recent years than he was in the 1980s and early 1990s, and we know that Trump was very aggressive back then.

But beyond these two big known unknowns of tax evasion and bribery, there are a lot of unknown unknowns. The United Airlines pump-and-dump scheme isn’t necessarily something anyone would specifically think to look into — it just emerged from examining his returns. It’s clear that Trump was pretty bad at managing casinos, but across the long span of his career, he’s also proven himself to be extremely flexible, capable, and opportunistic in terms of coming up with moneymaking schemes.

But for all his celebrity over the years, we simply don’t know all that much about what those schemes were — or who any victims might be — and tax returns are one of the best ways to find out.",www.vox.com,left,n5XARqOQawsLZzfP

Hillary Clinton took another sniper shot at Donald Trump’s tax reform plan last week by calling it “a tax cut for billionaires” like him. She even argued that Mr. Trump “spends” trillions of dollars on the tax cuts. Question: How do you spend money on a tax cut?

As Ronald Reagan would say: “well, there they go again.” Tax cuts for the rich is the boilerplate attack line against tax rate reductions. We’ve heard this every time a tax cut has been floated for the last 30 years.

But this criticism isn’t even close to historically accurate. Many times tax rate cuts — including in the 1960s under John F.

Hillary says that Mr. Trump has no way to pay for this tax cut. Wrong.

Mr. Trump has an aggressive government downsizing plan. He would repeal the costly and ineffective Obamacare law and replace it with consumer driven care. Obamacare promised to save $2,500 per family — but most families and businesses are seeing premiums skyrocket in cost.

The Trump plan will dramatically expand drilling for American energy, and reopen coal mines that have been closed under Mr. Obama.

taxes,Reason,2,https://reason.com/blog/2018/04/17/toward-a-more-infuriating-way-to-envisio,A More Infuriating Way to Think About Your Tax Burden,2018-04-17,"Brian Doherty, Elizabeth Nolan Brown, Josh Blackman, Charles Oliver, John Stossel, Eric Boehm, Shikha Dalmia","When people talk about the burden of government programs that clearly do n't benefit all , most , or even necessarily very many of the taxpayers on the hook for them , you often see their costs calculated in per capita terms across the whole population . Put that way , they seem laughably tiny , not worth even thinking about . Public broadcasting , for example , costs just $ 1.37 per citizen each year—far less than you pay to avoid getting kicked out of Starbucks every day .
But money is fungible , so you can conceptualize the relationship between what you pay in taxes and any given government program or expenditure in a far more infuriating way . Consider , on this magic day of civic responsibility , that every penny of your federal income tax burden this year ( and that of any number of other poor suckers with your same income ) is going to some relatively small and insignificant government program .
Here are 17 recent government expenditures , ranked from smallest to largest , that some of you may resent your taxes going to . ( Not all of these programs expend all their money in one calendar year—but again , money is fungible . ) Their costs are calculated in terms of how many citizens with a given taxable income ( according to this handy 2017 tax table , which you should bookmark if you just started trying to deal with your 1040 this morning ) it takes to pay for the expenditure . For those with taxable incomes higher than $ 100,000 , where the tax table cuts off , the average tax burden for folk within a given range of adjusted gross income is derived from this IRS data ( from 2015 , the most recent year they offer ) .
• EPA chief Scott Pruitt 's absurd $ 43,000 soundproof booth ? Every cent of the tax paid by 22 suckers with taxable incomes of $ 16,000 will go to pay for it .
• Doggie Hamlet . It would be cheap and easy to fill this entire list with specific bits of arts funding . Those who can not or would not enjoy the art themselves , and who are aware that lots of arts projects manage to support themselves with paying customers or willing patrons , can feel aggrieved by such expenditures . But let 's just pick one colorful example , Doggie Hamlet , a live performance that , as described in The Los Angeles Times , `` involves a flock of sheep , three herding dogs , six human performers , a few scattered pelts , plenty of green grass and very little ( if any ) Shakespeare . '' The Times notes that `` Narrative threatened to emerge at points in the production but never really took hold . When language was used , it was n't always easy to discern what was being said . Speech ultimately seemed no more consequential than bleating or barking . '' The eccentric show has received , via the New England Foundation for the Arts , $ 45,000 of our money . That 's the total tax burden of five of the sort of $ 50,000-taxable-income folk who might be apt to trouble themselves to see it .
• Legal education for Department of Energy employees . According to a 2017 report from the inspector general for the Department of Energy , the department `` paid for 29 college courses , totaling approximately $ 138,000 , for a general engineer to obtain a law degree . '' The report concluded that most of these courses `` were unrelated to his position at the Department , '' even though the rules governing such payments for employee education `` required training be applicable to workplace responsibilities and be mission-oriented . '' That lucky public employee enjoyed the full 2017 tax payments of 36 Americans with taxable income of $ 28,000 , folk who would likely be hard pressed to pay for their own legal education .
• The Chesapeake Bay Journal . The EPA has been giving $ 325,000 a year to this publication , which , as ███ contributing editor Walter Olson notes , `` was extensively covering proposed EPA budget cuts and framing them as threats to the bay . '' While not all of the publication 's mission was dedicated to coverage that pleased the EPA , elements of that payment did involve some self-reflexive lobbying for its own mission , eating up the entire tax payments of more than 67 Americans with taxable incomes of $ 35,000 .
• Tomahawk missile . A single one of the 66 Tomahawk Cruise Missiles that rained down on three Syrian targets this week cost $ 1.4 million . Chump change for the government , but it 's the entire tax burden of 446 people at the taxable income level of $ 24,000 ( likely close to that of a typical infantryman who might find himself harmed by the escalation of war in Syria ) .
• Research on incentives to lose weight . Like arts funding , federal social science research funding is a bunch of costly fish in an expensive barrel when making a list like this . So I 'll include just one item . As reported in Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Lankford 's Federal Fumbles , `` over the last five years the NIH [ National Institutes of Health ] has spent $ 1.6 million on research to discover that people paid to lose weight tend to lose more weight than those not paid to lose weight . '' To determine this , `` the researchers divided participants into three groups to see which would lose more weight : a group given direct financial compensation , a group whose members were entered into a lottery to incentivize weight loss , and a group in which everyone was given daily encouragement but no compensation . '' It was n't hard to predict the results , `` since an almost identical trial was funded by the NIH through a grant to the same university and researcher in 2008 . In that trial , the groups receiving the direct financial incentive and those in the lottery lost more weight than those without a financial incentive to lose weight . '' That exploration into some basic economics of incentives , pettily priced as it might be for government work , still amounts to the total tax burden of 42 low-grade fat cats with adjusted gross incomes in the $ 200,000– $ 250,000 a year range .
• Afghan prison . A depressing but powerfully symbolic expense of our 17 years and counting in Afghanistan is the $ 11.3 million the U.S. spent to build Baghlan Prison there . Three of its buildings were unusably poorly constructed , according to a 2017 report from the Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction . Attention , American citizens with $ 15,000 in taxable income : 6,319 of you are giving your entire debt to Uncle Sam to keep Afghans imprisoned in a crummy construction project .
• Unused IRS email program . The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration reported in 2016 that the IRS had `` purchased subscriptions for an enterprise e-mail system that , as it turned out , it could not use . The purchase was made without first determining project infrastructure needs , integration requirements , business requirements , security and portal bandwidth , and whether the subscriptions were technologically feasible on the IRS enterprise….The IRS authorized the $ 12 million purchase of subscriptions over a two-year period between June 2014 and June 2016 . However , the software to be used via the purchased subscriptions was never deployed . '' For 4,728 Americans with taxable income of $ 20,000 , your total payments in 2017 to this same IRS will equal this particular wasted expense .
• The federal government 's car collection . A 2017 Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) report on federally owned vehicles found that just two of the agencies whose car ownership and use it reviewed , the Customs and Border Patrol and the Natural Resources Conservation Service , `` cumulatively incurred an estimated $ 13.5 million in depreciation and maintenance costs in fiscal year 2015 '' for vehicles they were unable to prove had even been used that year . For 2,001 Americans of $ 44,000 taxable income , who would likely be keenly aware of the service they were or were not receiving from vehicles they might or might not own , all their tax burden goes to those federal mystery vehicles .
• Donald Trump 's inauguration . Not something most of us went to , not something many of us ever wanted to happen in the first place . And despite over $ 100 million raised from private sources to defray expenses , it also cost at least $ 100 million in public funds . Which means it ate up the entire average tax burdens of at least 5,575 taxpayers whose adjusted gross incomes were from $ 100,000– $ 200,000 .
• Federal grazing fees . This program supposedly puts money in the federal coffers , but by the time government is done with it , it tends to spend $ 120 million a year more than it takes in administering the program , according to a 2015 report from the Center for Biological Diversity . That 's the total tax burden of 6,577 Americans with a taxable income of $ 90,000 , who can certainly afford their own beef but perhaps should n't have their entire tax payments go toward subsidizing the people who raise it .
• Using the National Guard to fight the drug war . I 'm sure those who joined the National Guard to defend their country are delighted that Congress in fiscal 2017 earmarked $ 150 million for , in the words of the Center Against Government Waste , `` the National Guard Counter-Drug Program…which allows for the use of military personnel in domestic drug enforcement operations [ despite ] the existing Drug Enforcement Administration…budget of $ 2.1 billion . '' Is it constitutional ? The National Guard certainly thinks so , and wasting Guard members time and ruining innocent American lives is eating up the entire tax payment of 10,348 Americans with a reasonably hefty taxable income of $ 75,000 .
• Navy Air Operations Center . Some government programs are so apparently insignificant the government just abandons them before they are completed , like what Defense News last year described as `` a network upgrade for the Air Operations Center , a key tool used by the service to plan and conduct air operations . '' It was cancelled last year after an estimated $ 745 million had already been spent failing to get it off the ground . If you 've got an adjusted gross income of over a quarter-million yourself , you and 4,137 of your fellow plutocrats had to cough up all your 2017 taxes to cover that mistake .
• F-35 fighter plane . The mere acquisition cost of the troubled F-35 fighter plane is now estimated at $ 164.6 million per jet , never mind the cost of keeping them operational over a lifetime . If you 're earning in the $ 100,000– $ 200,000 a year range of adjusted gross income , and you and 9,176 of your fellow Americans are on the hook for your entire yearly tax bill to get just one of those monstrosities onto the field .
• Public relations . The federal government does n't have to sell anything to survive , but rather lives off money appropriated whether the poor folk paying for it want to or not . You might think such an entity does n't feel the need to spend much on public relations . You would be wrong . It takes 414,258 poor folk with taxable income of $ 10,000 to pay for the recent average of $ 430 million a year spent on public relations employees of the federal government , according to a 2016 GAO report .
• Fighter planes that the F-35 is supposed to replace . Remember that F-35 that costs $ 164.6 million per jet ? While we 're waiting for that decades-long program to come to complete fruition , the Center Against Government Waste points out , we are also spending—in fiscal year 2017 alone— $ 1.02 billion
for four earmarks funding two planes intended to be replaced by the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter ( JSF ) : $ 979 million for 12 additional F/A-18 E/F Hornets for the Navy ; $ 24.8 million for F-16 mission training center simulators ; $ 12 million for a missile warning system for the F-16 ; and $ 5 million for anti-jamming GPS for the F-16 . The Air Force declared its variant of the JSF to be combat ready in August 2016 , 15 years after Lockheed Martin won the contract . However , a report released in the same month by former DOD Operational Test and Evaluation Director Michael Gilmore found that , `` achieving full combat capability with the Joint Strike Fighter is at substantial risk '' of not occurring prior to the end of development . The report described the JSF as `` … not on a path toward success but instead on a path toward failing to deliver . ''
If your taxable income is just a nose under the maximum for the tax table , $ 99,950 , 48,629 people just like you are paying around one-fifth of that income every year , your total federal income tax burden , just to keep these planned-to-be-obsolete jets in the air .
• San Diego 's trolley . What 's even more expensive than a notorious Pentagon boondoggle ? It 's easy for most Americans to be unaware that federal aid for local transportation boondoggles even exists , even ( or perhaps especially ) if you are one of the many locals who will never use the subsidized transportation . Consider , then , the $ 1.04 billion that the Department of Transportation has earmarked for extending a San Diego trolley system by 10 miles . That has n't all been spent yet , but if the department stays the course let 's think of how that will add up for San Diegans with taxable incomes of $ 33,000 , whether or not they ever ride the trolley : 223,707 of them just spent their whole tax bills on it .
( A hat tip on guidance to some of these expenditures to Sen. Lankford 's Federal Fumbles and to the Center Against Government Waste 's Congressional Pig Book . )","When people talk about the burden of government programs that clearly don't benefit all, most, or even necessarily very many of the taxpayers on the hook for them, you often see their costs calculated in per capita terms across the whole population. Put that way, they seem laughably tiny, not worth even thinking about. Public broadcasting, for example, costs just $1.37 per citizen each year—far less than you pay to avoid getting kicked out of Starbucks every day.

But money is fungible, so you can conceptualize the relationship between what you pay in taxes and any given government program or expenditure in a far more infuriating way. Consider, on this magic day of civic responsibility, that every penny of your federal income tax burden this year (and that of any number of other poor suckers with your same income) is going to some relatively small and insignificant government program.

Here are 17 recent government expenditures, ranked from smallest to largest, that some of you may resent your taxes going to. (Not all of these programs expend all their money in one calendar year—but again, money is fungible.) Their costs are calculated in terms of how many citizens with a given taxable income (according to this handy 2017 tax table, which you should bookmark if you just started trying to deal with your 1040 this morning) it takes to pay for the expenditure. For those with taxable incomes higher than $100,000, where the tax table cuts off, the average tax burden for folk within a given range of adjusted gross income is derived from this IRS data (from 2015, the most recent year they offer).

• EPA chief Scott Pruitt's absurd $43,000 soundproof booth? Every cent of the tax paid by 22 suckers with taxable incomes of $16,000 will go to pay for it.

• Doggie Hamlet. It would be cheap and easy to fill this entire list with specific bits of arts funding. Those who cannot or would not enjoy the art themselves, and who are aware that lots of arts projects manage to support themselves with paying customers or willing patrons, can feel aggrieved by such expenditures. But let's just pick one colorful example, Doggie Hamlet, a live performance that, as described in The Los Angeles Times, ""involves a flock of sheep, three herding dogs, six human performers, a few scattered pelts, plenty of green grass and very little (if any) Shakespeare."" The Times notes that ""Narrative threatened to emerge at points in the production but never really took hold. When language was used, it wasn't always easy to discern what was being said. Speech ultimately seemed no more consequential than bleating or barking."" The eccentric show has received, via the New England Foundation for the Arts, $45,000 of our money. That's the total tax burden of five of the sort of $50,000-taxable-income folk who might be apt to trouble themselves to see it.

• Legal education for Department of Energy employees. According to a 2017 report from the inspector general for the Department of Energy, the department ""paid for 29 college courses, totaling approximately $138,000, for a general engineer to obtain a law degree."" The report concluded that most of these courses ""were unrelated to his position at the Department,"" even though the rules governing such payments for employee education ""required training be applicable to workplace responsibilities and be mission-oriented."" That lucky public employee enjoyed the full 2017 tax payments of 36 Americans with taxable income of $28,000, folk who would likely be hard pressed to pay for their own legal education.

• The Chesapeake Bay Journal. The EPA has been giving $325,000 a year to this publication, which, as Reason contributing editor Walter Olson notes, ""was extensively covering proposed EPA budget cuts and framing them as threats to the bay."" While not all of the publication's mission was dedicated to coverage that pleased the EPA, elements of that payment did involve some self-reflexive lobbying for its own mission, eating up the entire tax payments of more than 67 Americans with taxable incomes of $35,000.

• Tomahawk missile. A single one of the 66 Tomahawk Cruise Missiles that rained down on three Syrian targets this week cost $1.4 million. Chump change for the government, but it's the entire tax burden of 446 people at the taxable income level of $24,000 (likely close to that of a typical infantryman who might find himself harmed by the escalation of war in Syria).

• Research on incentives to lose weight. Like arts funding, federal social science research funding is a bunch of costly fish in an expensive barrel when making a list like this. So I'll include just one item. As reported in Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Lankford's Federal Fumbles, ""over the last five years the NIH [National Institutes of Health] has spent $1.6 million on research to discover that people paid to lose weight tend to lose more weight than those not paid to lose weight."" To determine this, ""the researchers divided participants into three groups to see which would lose more weight: a group given direct financial compensation, a group whose members were entered into a lottery to incentivize weight loss, and a group in which everyone was given daily encouragement but no compensation."" It wasn't hard to predict the results, ""since an almost identical trial was funded by the NIH through a grant to the same university and researcher in 2008. In that trial, the groups receiving the direct financial incentive and those in the lottery lost more weight than those without a financial incentive to lose weight."" That exploration into some basic economics of incentives, pettily priced as it might be for government work, still amounts to the total tax burden of 42 low-grade fat cats with adjusted gross incomes in the $200,000–$250,000 a year range.

• Afghan prison. A depressing but powerfully symbolic expense of our 17 years and counting in Afghanistan is the $11.3 million the U.S. spent to build Baghlan Prison there. Three of its buildings were unusably poorly constructed, according to a 2017 report from the Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction. Attention, American citizens with $15,000 in taxable income: 6,319 of you are giving your entire debt to Uncle Sam to keep Afghans imprisoned in a crummy construction project.

• Unused IRS email program. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration reported in 2016 that the IRS had ""purchased subscriptions for an enterprise e-mail system that, as it turned out, it could not use. The purchase was made without first determining project infrastructure needs, integration requirements, business requirements, security and portal bandwidth, and whether the subscriptions were technologically feasible on the IRS enterprise….The IRS authorized the $12 million purchase of subscriptions over a two-year period between June 2014 and June 2016. However, the software to be used via the purchased subscriptions was never deployed."" For 4,728 Americans with taxable income of $20,000, your total payments in 2017 to this same IRS will equal this particular wasted expense.

• The federal government's car collection. A 2017 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on federally owned vehicles found that just two of the agencies whose car ownership and use it reviewed, the Customs and Border Patrol and the Natural Resources Conservation Service, ""cumulatively incurred an estimated $13.5 million in depreciation and maintenance costs in fiscal year 2015"" for vehicles they were unable to prove had even been used that year. For 2,001 Americans of $44,000 taxable income, who would likely be keenly aware of the service they were or were not receiving from vehicles they might or might not own, all their tax burden goes to those federal mystery vehicles.

• Donald Trump's inauguration. Not something most of us went to, not something many of us ever wanted to happen in the first place. And despite over $100 million raised from private sources to defray expenses, it also cost at least $100 million in public funds. Which means it ate up the entire average tax burdens of at least 5,575 taxpayers whose adjusted gross incomes were from $100,000–$200,000.

• Federal grazing fees. This program supposedly puts money in the federal coffers, but by the time government is done with it, it tends to spend $120 million a year more than it takes in administering the program, according to a 2015 report from the Center for Biological Diversity. That's the total tax burden of 6,577 Americans with a taxable income of $90,000, who can certainly afford their own beef but perhaps shouldn't have their entire tax payments go toward subsidizing the people who raise it.

• Using the National Guard to fight the drug war. I'm sure those who joined the National Guard to defend their country are delighted that Congress in fiscal 2017 earmarked $150 million for, in the words of the Center Against Government Waste, ""the National Guard Counter-Drug Program…which allows for the use of military personnel in domestic drug enforcement operations [despite] the existing Drug Enforcement Administration…budget of $2.1 billion."" Is it constitutional? The National Guard certainly thinks so, and wasting Guard members time and ruining innocent American lives is eating up the entire tax payment of 10,348 Americans with a reasonably hefty taxable income of $75,000.

• Navy Air Operations Center. Some government programs are so apparently insignificant the government just abandons them before they are completed, like what Defense News last year described as ""a network upgrade for the Air Operations Center, a key tool used by the service to plan and conduct air operations."" It was cancelled last year after an estimated $745 million had already been spent failing to get it off the ground. If you've got an adjusted gross income of over a quarter-million yourself, you and 4,137 of your fellow plutocrats had to cough up all your 2017 taxes to cover that mistake.

• F-35 fighter plane. The mere acquisition cost of the troubled F-35 fighter plane is now estimated at $164.6 million per jet, never mind the cost of keeping them operational over a lifetime. If you're earning in the $100,000–$200,000 a year range of adjusted gross income, and you and 9,176 of your fellow Americans are on the hook for your entire yearly tax bill to get just one of those monstrosities onto the field.

• Public relations. The federal government doesn't have to sell anything to survive, but rather lives off money appropriated whether the poor folk paying for it want to or not. You might think such an entity doesn't feel the need to spend much on public relations. You would be wrong. It takes 414,258 poor folk with taxable income of $10,000 to pay for the recent average of $430 million a year spent on public relations employees of the federal government, according to a 2016 GAO report.

• Fighter planes that the F-35 is supposed to replace. Remember that F-35 that costs $164.6 million per jet? While we're waiting for that decades-long program to come to complete fruition, the Center Against Government Waste points out, we are also spending—in fiscal year 2017 alone—$1.02 billion

for four earmarks funding two planes intended to be replaced by the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF): $979 million for 12 additional F/A-18 E/F Hornets for the Navy; $24.8 million for F-16 mission training center simulators; $12 million for a missile warning system for the F-16; and $5 million for anti-jamming GPS for the F-16. The Air Force declared its variant of the JSF to be combat ready in August 2016, 15 years after Lockheed Martin won the contract. However, a report released in the same month by former DOD Operational Test and Evaluation Director Michael Gilmore found that, ""achieving full combat capability with the Joint Strike Fighter is at substantial risk"" of not occurring prior to the end of development. The report described the JSF as ""… not on a path toward success but instead on a path toward failing to deliver.""

If your taxable income is just a nose under the maximum for the tax table, $99,950, 48,629 people just like you are paying around one-fifth of that income every year, your total federal income tax burden, just to keep these planned-to-be-obsolete jets in the air.

• San Diego's trolley. What's even more expensive than a notorious Pentagon boondoggle? It's easy for most Americans to be unaware that federal aid for local transportation boondoggles even exists, even (or perhaps especially) if you are one of the many locals who will never use the subsidized transportation. Consider, then, the $1.04 billion that the Department of Transportation has earmarked for extending a San Diego trolley system by 10 miles. That hasn't all been spent yet, but if the department stays the course let's think of how that will add up for San Diegans with taxable incomes of $33,000, whether or not they ever ride the trolley: 223,707 of them just spent their whole tax bills on it.

(A hat tip on guidance to some of these expenditures to Sen. Lankford's Federal Fumbles and to the Center Against Government Waste's Congressional Pig Book.)",www.reason.com,right,jxHtNLocatwhErNt

He was born there in 1932 , grew up there , and worked his entire adult life there . I ’ m sure he planned on dying there .
After a few years living in a rental apartment after a stint as an officer in the U.S. Air Force , he took the plunge with his young bride and purchased his first and only home , for $ 32,000 , back in 1961 in northern New Jersey . A high-school history teacher , he coached varsity basketball and worked night and summer jobs to support his growing family . Twenty-plus years later , he became the superintendent of schools in the same public-school system that gave him his first job .
He didn ’ t remember his first property-tax bill , because it was so low . There was no state income tax in New Jersey back in 1961 , and no state sales tax until 1966 . The only taxes individuals paid to the state were on gasoline , tobacco , and alcohol .
It was an ideal place to live ; drive an hour east , and he was in New York City with his family visiting a museum or going to a Broadway play . Drive an hour south , and they were enjoying a day trip at the Jersey Shore .
He lived a great middle-class life . Rising college costs , health-care costs , and taxes had not yet put the squeeze on working-class New Jersey families . With some part-time work on the kids ’ part , some modest student loans , and some help from Mom and Dad , college was within reach of almost every family in town . Two of his sons got law degrees ; one , an MBA ; and his daughter skipped college to become a professional songwriter and composer .
Two years ago , his wife of 56 years died after a struggle with cancer . Retired and living on a pension , he found himself alone . Most of his friends had passed away , and the kids he ’ d raised left New Jersey years ago . Two of those kids would tell you they ’ d fled the state .
He called one day not long after his wife died , to let them know he was thinking of selling his house . He didn ’ t say why . He grew up at a time when dads didn ’ t share their every thought with their kids , let alone their feelings or financial concerns .
But his kids knew why . The property taxes on the house their dad purchased for $ 32,000 back in 1961 had swelled , from a number so low he couldn ’ t remember it to a number he could not forget : $ 12,000 a year .
That number , reduced to a monthly payment , was five times higher than his home ’ s original monthly mortgage payment . Indeed , if you ’ d told him back when he bought the house that , many years later , three years ’ worth of property-tax bills added together would exceed the house ’ s cost , he ’ d have written you off as crazy .
But it was true . The home my father thought he owned outright had a co-owner : the local city council and school board . And it was a co-owner with an appetite for spending . Home ownership may have had its privileges , but it became a burden he could no longer afford .
The home my father thought he owned outright had a co-owner : the local city council and school board . And it was a co-owner with an appetite for spending .
The local property-tax bill alone was enough to make him move . On top of that , New Jersey went from having no state income tax to having one of the highest in the country ( 8.97 percent for the highest earners , and 6.4 percent for the middle class ) , and from having no sales tax to having one of the highest rates in the country ( 7 percent , almost as high as California ’ s , which is the highest sales tax in America , at 7.5 percent ) . It was all too much for him to handle .
Saddled by taxes and worried that future tax increases would eat up his retirement income and his savings , this lifelong New Jersey resident , at age 81 , did what so many folks in high-tax states like New Jersey are forced to do : He sold his house and moved .
That guy in this story happens to be my dad , and he ’ s an American refugee . I say “ refugee ” because the definition of the word in Merriam-Webster reads as follows : “ someone who has been forced to leave a country because of war or for religious reasons or political reasons . ”
My dad didn ’ t leave his country , but he left his home state . And he left because leaders there treated its residents like an ATM for several decades running , passing local and state tax increases that priced him out of his own home . And out of his home state .
Indeed , New Jersey led all 50 states in one tragic category : creating refugees . Last year , the Garden State lost more residents as a percentage of its overall population than any other state in the country , according to a 2014 National Movers Study commissioned by United Van Lines of St. Louis .
New Jersey led its “ outbound ” list , with 64 percent of all moves being from New Jersey to other states . In case you might think that this past year was some kind of anomaly : New Jersey has been no lower than third in the nation on the United Van Lines survey since 2006 when it comes to the ratio of people moving in to people moving out .
“ Who needs a house out in Hackensack ? ” asked Billy Joel in his hit song “ Movin ’ Out. ” “ Is that all you get for your money ? ” It ’ s a question New Jersey residents have been asking themselves for decades , especially when they hear stories from friends who ’ ve escaped to places like North Carolina and Texas .
I fled New Jersey many years ago and now live in a beautiful college town in northern Mississippi . The mortgage payment for my home in Oxford would be twice as high , at least , if I lived in New Jersey . And the property taxes would be six times higher , at least . The $ 2,000 a year I pay in Oxford , which touts some great public schools , is $ 10,000 a year less than the taxes on the house my dad sold in New Jersey two years ago . And the home I live in is bigger , nicer , and has much more land . That adds up to $ 20,000-plus a year in savings on housing costs alone .
I fled because I could . To do my job , I need mostly to travel and have access to the Internet , cell service , and a decent airport . Which is increasingly the case for millions of Americans . Where I live doesn ’ t affect how much money I make , but it does affect how much money I keep .
I fled because I could . To do my job , I need mostly to travel and have access to the Internet and cell service . Where I live doesn ’ t affect how much money I make , but it does affect how much money I keep .
The chance for better housing at a much lower cost is a big reason — perhaps the main reason — that so many New Jersey residents would flee if they had a chance . Other costs , from traffic to tolls to the general quality of life , are nagging and pile up too .
In a poll conducted by Monmouth University a few years ago , 53 percent of New Jersey residents said they would like to move from the state at some point , up from 49 percent in 2007 . Among those making more than $ 100,000 a year , a whopping 60 percent wanted to move .
Moving is not a pleasant experience by any calculation . It means leaving your friends , family , clubs , churches . It means leaving your life behind and , in many respects , starting your life over .
Moving isn ’ t something most adults choose to do , or like to do . It ’ s something we feel compelled to do . Moving routinely ranks near the top of any top-ten list of stress events in a person ’ s life .
If moving a family is stressful , imagine the forces at work that would propel an entire business to move . Earlier this year , Daimler ’ s Mercedes-Benz USA announced it was moving its headquarters from Montvale , just miles from where I grew up in New Jersey , to Sandy Springs , Ga . It will bring nearly 1,000 people along with it , at an average annual salary of nearly $ 80,000 .
“ It became apparent that to achieve the sustained , profitable growth and efficiencies we require for the decades ahead , our headquarters would have to be located elsewhere , ” Stephen Cannon , president and chief executive of Mercedes-Benz USA , told the press . After all the math is done , and Mercedes-Benz completes its new $ 75 million headquarters in 2017 , it will have reduced its overhead by a whopping 20 percent a year , according to John Boyd , an adviser on corporate relocations .
That news came on the heels of a series of corporate defections from the Garden State over the past few years . In 2013 , Hertz , the car-rental company , moved its headquarters — and its 550 jobs — from New Jersey to Florida . Last summer , Sealed Air Corporation ( the bubble-wrap maker ) announced plans to move its headquarters from New Jersey to North Carolina .
Those businesses are fleeing New Jersey for the same reason so many residents are fleeing : the high cost of doing business there . Indeed , New Jersey ranked 50th , dead last , in the Tax Foundation ’ s 2015 State Tax Business Climate Index .
Those relocation stories are great news for the people of Georgia , North Carolina , and Florida . But they ’ re terrible news for the people of New Jersey , who are stuck with ever-increasing tax bills and fewer employers and workers to pay them .
It ’ s a vicious cycle , and stopping it is no small task . The country watched in disbelief as one of our great American cities , Detroit , created over a million refugees over five decades , as its population fell from a peak of nearly 1,700,000 in 1960 to its current 680,000 . It spent , mismanaged , and shrank itself into bankruptcy .
How states , cities , and nations treat capital — the human kind and the money kind — matters . How leaders think about capital matters too . The ability to manage , nurture , and preserve it , and to grow a healthy tax base ( not destroy it ) , is what will separate winners from losers .
“ The correlation is very impressive between taxes and population , ” Charles Lieberman , former head of monetary analysis at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York explained to Bloomberg last year . “ The tax rates of the 10 slowest-population-growth states are very high , and the fastest growers are among the lowest tax rates . ”
There are two roads ahead for state leaders , and a person need not have a Ph.D. in economics or to have served a stint at the Federal Reserve to figure which one to take .

Jeb Bush's tax problem

Jeb Bush has a tax problem.

The former Florida governor has said he could accept tax increases in a hypothetical deficit-cutting deal. Never mind that he added that would come only in exchange for major federal spending cuts, or that he repeatedly cut taxes as governor.

Tax hikes are still apostasy in Republican circles, and the stance could be a big problem for Bush if he decides to seek the party’s presidential nomination in 2016.

Bush’s views are already pitting him against one of his party’s most influential activists, Grover Norquist, the high priest of anti-tax orthodoxy who’s convinced nearly every elected Republican to sign a pledge not to raise taxes.

“Mind-boggling,” Norquist said of Bush.

It’s the very issue that helped bring down Bush’s father, former President George H.W. Bush, who lost his bid for a second term after famously reneging on a “no new taxes” pledge.

“If my father had thrown away a perfectly good presidency by raising taxes, I think one of the things in life that I would learn is, ‘Don’t do that,’” Norquist said. “But here you have Jeb Bush going, ‘I learned nothing from my father’s self-immolation.”

Add to that Bush’s left-of-party views on immigration and education, and he’s got a trio of issues where rivals would paint him as a squish, out of touch with the rock-solid conservatives who rule the early presidential primaries.

And while Bush might be able to talk through education and immigration by portraying himself as a forward-thinking Republican, opponents would seize on the slightest wobble when it comes to taxes.

“‘I’m running because I want to raise your taxes so I can fix Medicaid and Medicare?” said Katon Dawson, former chairman of the Republican Party in South Carolina, a state with a notoriously fierce primary. “If that’s the sound bite, good luck.” He said, “I’ve seen ‘em win primaries talking about getting the burden of the government off their back.

“If you could bring to me a majority of people to say that we’re going to have $10 of spending cuts for $1 of revenue enhancement — put me in, Coach,” Bush told lawmakers. “This will prove I’m not running for anything,” added Bush, who at the time was the subject of speculation that he might become Romney’s running mate.

The personal income tax cuts included in the bill, for example, are set to expire in 2025, two years before the end of the 10-year window used for budget projections.

Again.,2019-11-06,"Christian Britschgi, David Bernstein, Will Baude, Ilya Somin, Zuri Davis, Elizabeth Nolan Brown, Eric Boehm","Texas , a state so nice they banned income taxes twice .
On Tuesday , some 76 percent of voters in the state approved Prop 4 , a constitutional amendment that prohibits the imposition of a state income tax .
The immediate practical impact of the vote is slight , given that Texas currently has no income tax , and the state constitution had already made passing one a difficult endeavor . The success of Prop . 4 nevertheless highlights the bipartisan political appeal of Texas ' long refusal to take a cut of people 's paychecks .
`` THANK YOU TEXANS ! ! ! ! Future generations of Texans will thank you too , '' tweeted Texas Gov . Greg Abbott , a Republican , after the vote . `` Keep Government out of your pocketbook . ''
Prior to the vote , Abbott had tweeted a video of himself tearing up a California state income tax return form . `` I never want to see one of these in the great state of Texas , '' he says to the camera .
This is not the first time Texas has passed strict constitutional limits on the state 's ability to tax income . In 1993 , voters approved an amendment that required any income tax to be approved by both the state legislature and voters through a statewide referendum . Any revenue generated by an income tax had to be dedicated to education funding .
At the end of last year , Rep. Jeff Leach ( R–Plano ) introduced HJR 38 , which would refer the question of a constitutional prohibition on an income tax to voters . Because Leach 's measure would amend the state constitution , it required two-thirds supermajorities—or support from some Democrats—in both the House and Senate , which it got .
`` My constituents do n't want a state income tax . And that 's what I 'm here to do is represent them , '' said one Democratic lawmaker when asked by the Dallas Morning News why she voted with Republicans to put HJR 38 ( later to become Prop 4 ) on the ballot .
A full two-thirds of the Texas legislature is now required to repeal the state 's income tax prohibition . Actually imposing an income tax would require additional legislation .
The lack of a state income tax is key to Texas ' economic competitiveness , says Janelle Cammenga , a policy analyst with the Tax Foundation , a D.C.-based think tank .
`` Income taxes are more economically harmful than consumption taxes because they capture both present and future income , and this discourages investment , '' she tells ███ in an email , writing that `` the absence of an income tax is the most competitive part of Texas 's tax code . ''
Texas is one of seven states to opt out of levying an income tax . The Tax Foundation rates Texas 13th on its state business tax climate index . The Cato Institute 's `` Freedom in the 50 States '' project ranks Texas as the seventh most free state on fiscal matters .
In addition to being good policy , the absence of an income tax has proven pretty popular , says Cammenga .
`` Some states have better alternatives to income taxes than others , but when a state eliminates its income tax , most voters like to keep it that way , '' she says . `` That 's true in red states like Texas and blue states like Washington . ''","Texas, a state so nice they banned income taxes twice.

On Tuesday, some 76 percent of voters in the state approved Prop 4, a constitutional amendment that prohibits the imposition of a state income tax.

The immediate practical impact of the vote is slight, given that Texas currently has no income tax, and the state constitution had already made passing one a difficult endeavor. The success of Prop. 4 nevertheless highlights the bipartisan political appeal of Texas' long refusal to take a cut of people's paychecks.

""THANK YOU TEXANS!!!! Future generations of Texans will thank you too,"" tweeted Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, after the vote. ""Keep Government out of your pocketbook.""

Prior to the vote, Abbott had tweeted a video of himself tearing up a California state income tax return form. ""I never want to see one of these in the great state of Texas,"" he says to the camera.

This is not the first time Texas has passed strict constitutional limits on the state's ability to tax income. In 1993, voters approved an amendment that required any income tax to be approved by both the state legislature and voters through a statewide referendum. Any revenue generated by an income tax had to be dedicated to education funding.

That wasn't enough for some state legislators, however.

At the end of last year, Rep. Jeff Leach (R–Plano) introduced HJR 38, which would refer the question of a constitutional prohibition on an income tax to voters. Because Leach's measure would amend the state constitution, it required two-thirds supermajorities—or support from some Democrats—in both the House and Senate, which it got.

""My constituents don't want a state income tax. And that's what I'm here to do is represent them,"" said one Democratic lawmaker when asked by the Dallas Morning News why she voted with Republicans to put HJR 38 (later to become Prop 4) on the ballot.

A full two-thirds of the Texas legislature is now required to repeal the state's income tax prohibition. Actually imposing an income tax would require additional legislation.

The lack of a state income tax is key to Texas' economic competitiveness, says Janelle Cammenga, a policy analyst with the Tax Foundation, a D.C.-based think tank.

""Income taxes are more economically harmful than consumption taxes because they capture both present and future income, and this discourages investment,"" she tells Reason in an email, writing that ""the absence of an income tax is the most competitive part of Texas's tax code.""

Texas is one of seven states to opt out of levying an income tax. The Tax Foundation rates Texas 13th on its state business tax climate index. The Cato Institute's ""Freedom in the 50 States"" project ranks Texas as the seventh most free state on fiscal matters.

In addition to being good policy, the absence of an income tax has proven pretty popular, says Cammenga.

""Some states have better alternatives to income taxes than others, but when a state eliminates its income tax, most voters like to keep it that way,"" she says. ""That's true in red states like Texas and blue states like Washington.""",www.reason.com,right,T3rlhjNq35IR1EF0

Democrats have been saying for years that we need tax increases, and that paying taxes is one of the greatest forms of patriotism. Now it looks like President Trump is going to put their beliefs to the test.

Trump’s new tax plan would hit blue states hardest, by eliminating the federal deductibility of state income and property taxes. That’s going to make it harder for blue states to maintain the high tax rates they’ve traditionally levied.

Right now, if you pay state property or income taxes, you can deduct them against your federal income taxes. In effect, it means that if you’re in a high federal bracket, your state taxes may be offset by that federal deduction to the tune of 40% or more.

As economist Nicole Kaeding told The Hill, by allowing deductions for state taxes, “the federal government is essentially subsidizing high tax rates in states like California and New York.”

States should be able to set their own levels of taxing and spending, but I see no reason why a Walmart cashier in Tennessee (which has no state income tax and low property taxes) should be subsidizing a hedge fund mogul in New York or a studio executive in Hollywood. It’s fine if blue states want to have higher state and local tax rates, as they do, but they shouldn’t be encouraged to do so by federal tax giveaways. And it’s the urban, coastal areas that have done best over the past 25 years, so it seems time for them to pay their fair share now.

In that spirit, I have a few other proposals. First, we should eliminate the mortgage interest deduction. Experts have been calling for that for years, and they’re right to. The deduction was part of an ill-considered federal effort to encourage home ownership by people who could only marginally afford it, but that has backfired with the bursting of the housing bubble.

In addition, of course, the mortgage interest deduction encourages and perpetuates high housing prices, which ultimately make housing less, not more, affordable. It gives you bigger benefits when you make a lot of money and own an expensive home. It’s essentially a transfer of money from the young, the poor, and the rural to the old, the wealthy and the urban.

There are a lot of things like this in the tax code: When tax-making powers are exercised by politicians, taxes are generally written in a way that benefits people politicians care about, who tend to be rich and powerful.

Update at 6:10 p.m. ET: White House: IRS was 'Inappropriate':

White House press secretary Jay Carney called the IRS actions ""inappropriate"" and said they should be investigated.

Carney, speaking to reporters Friday afternoon, noted that the Internal Revenue Service is an independent agency with only two political appointees.

Here's our original post:

Saying that it was wrong, insensitive and inappropriate, a top official from the Internal Revenue Service apologized Friday to conservative groups that were singled out for additional IRS scrutiny during the 2012 campaign.

The Associated Press writes that Lois Lerner, who heads the IRS division that oversees tax-exempt groups, said at a conference sponsored by the American Bar Association:

""That the practice was initiated by low-level workers in Cincinnati and was not motivated by political bias. After her talk, she told The AP that no high level IRS officials knew about the practice. She did not say when they found out.""

Lerner said some organizations that included the words ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" in applications for tax-exempt status were put through unnecessary, additional reviews, the AP adds.

As The Hill notes:

""A number of conservative outside groups complained in 2012 that they were being unfairly targeted by the IRS. Some groups classified as tax-exempt charities are allowed to carry out political activities as long as it's not their primary focus, though the law is a bit murky on what constitutes too much pure election activity.""

Lerner told the conference that about 75 organizations that were ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" groups were singled out. She said the extra scrutiny came in part because there was a surge in applications from groups seeking tax-exempt status. As reviewers searched for signs that some of the groups might be engaging in political activity (which could disqualify them from being granted tax-exempt status), they looked for keywords. Among those that the reviewers looked for were ""tea party"" and ""patriot.""

One of the groups, the Tea Party Patriots, has released a statement rejecting the apology. It says, in part:

""The IRS has demonstrated the most disturbing, illegal and outrageous abuse of government power,"" said Jenny Beth Martin, National Coordinator for Tea Party Patriots. ""This deliberate targeting and harassment of tea party groups reaches a new low in illegal government activity and overreach. It is suspicious that the activity of these 'low-level workers' was unknown to IRS leadership at the time it occurred. President Obama must also apologize for his administration ignoring repeated complaints by these broad grassroots organizations of harassment by the IRS in 2012, and make concrete and transparent steps today to ensure this never happens again.

`` Start building new plants now . Exciting ! '' Trump said Saturday in a tweet aimed at the Cupertino , California-based company .
This week , Apple said that a proposed new round of $ 200 billion in additional tariffs on Chinese imports would raise prices on some of its products , including the Apple Watch and the Mac mini .
The company is highly exposed to a trade war between the U.S. and China . It makes many of its products for the U.S. market in China , and it also sells gadgets including the iPhone in China , making them a potential target for Chinese retaliation against the Trump tariffs .
Trump tweeted Saturday that `` Apple prices may increase because of the massive Tariffs we may be imposing on China — but there is an easy solution where there would be ZERO tax , and indeed a tax incentive , '' if the company made its products in the U.S. instead of China .
Apple did n't immediately respond to a request for comment . The company has not announced plans to move manufacturing from China to the U.S .
In its letter this week to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative , Apple said that `` because all tariffs ultimately show up as a tax on US consumers , they will increase the cost of Apple products that our customers have come to rely on in their daily lives . ''
The company said tariffs would hit `` a wide range of Apple products , '' including computers , watches , adapters , chargers and tools used in its U.S. manufacturing , repair and data centers . Apple said the tariffs would raise the cost of its U.S. operations and put it at a disadvantage to foreign rivals .
The White House has accused China of stealing U.S. intellectual property and forcing American companies to share their technology with Chinese companies . The tariffs would pressure China to stop that behavior , the administration has said . Apple said `` it is difficult to see '' how tariffs would advance the government 's goal .
The presidential tweet is the latest salvo in a dispute between the Trump administration and companies that fear tariffs will hurt their business .
The Trump administration has imposed tariffs of $ 50 billion on imports from China , mostly equipment and material used by manufacturers . CEO Tim Cook said in July that those measures had no effect on Apple . The company is concerned , however , about the Trump administration 's proposal to add 25 percent duties on another $ 200 billion in Chinese goods , including a wider assortment of consumer-related items .","President Donald Trump concedes that some Apple Inc. products may become more expensive if his administration imposes ""massive"" additional tariffs on Chinese-made goods, but he says the tech company can fix the problem by moving production to the U.S.

Reid ripped New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ’ s proposal for a 70-percent marginal tax rate during an interview with The Nevada Independent . Reid called out Ocasio-Cortez for her “ radical ” proposal while arguing that Democrats should push for incremental change instead . ( RELATED : Trump Shrugs Off Ocasio-Cortez Criticism : ’ Who Cares ? ’ )
“ A person could say we need to raise taxes a little bit , ” Reid said . “ We have to be careful because the American people are very conservative in the sense of not wanting radical change quickly . ”
The self-proclaimed socialist from Queens , New York , has shaken up the Democratic Party with her desire for sweeping leftist policy change including : higher tax rates for top income earners ( in her words , the “ tippy tops ” of the U.S. population ) ; a “ Green New Deal , ” which would plan to eliminate carbon emissions in the United States within 12 years and possibly create other regulations ; and “ Medicare for All , ” a proposed socialist-style healthcare system — which has received support from many congressional Democrats — that Ocasio-Cortez claims would be cheaper than our current healthcare system , though some have argued against such an idea .
Reid made clear that he would rather Democrats focus on shoring up past legislative accomplishments rather than advocate for sweeping change .
“ It ’ s a shame what they ’ ve done with ObamaCare , ” Reid said . “ That was certainly a step in the right direction . The Democrat has to talk about health care , restoring Obamacare or versions of it . ”

The Tax Foundation , an “ independent tax policy nonprofit ” organization , according to their website , found that a proposal to raise the marginal tax rate to 70 percent for incomes over $ 10 million would only raise roughly $ 51.4 billion over the next 10 years .
A more generous study conducted by the organization , however , found that a different proposal for the same tax hike idea for incomes over $ 10 million would raise $ 291 billion over the same time period — still only a fraction of the cost needed to pay for Ocasio-Cortez ’ s ambitious agenda .","Former Nevada Democratic Sen.

Mr. Obama and Democrats have said they need to see tax rates rise , while Republicans have said entitlement programs must face spending cuts .
But both sides are also under enormous pressure to resist each other ’ s demands . On Tuesday , Mr. Obama met with liberal leaders at the White House and they urged him to reject any deal that would cut Social Security or Medicare .
“ The truth is America does not face an ‘ entitlement crisis. ’ We should not be cutting Social Security and Medicare benefits to put our fiscal house in order , ” said Max Richtman , president of the National Committee to Protect Social Security & Medicare .
The so-called fiscal cliff hits early next year . The Bush-era tax cuts expire Jan. 1 , and $ 110 billion in automatic spending cuts take effect Jan. 2 as a result of last year ’ s debt deal .

taxes,The Hill,1,http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/358712-tax-bill-raises-red-flags-for-senate-gop,Tax bill raises red flags for Senate GOP,2017-11-05,,"The House GOP tax-reform package has put Senate Republicans in a tough spot , much like the House-passed ObamaCare repeal bill did earlier this year .
The legislation is expected to pass the House , starting a tougher battle in the Senate , where Republicans control 52 seats and can ’ t pass a bill if they suffer more than two defections and Democrats remain unified .
At least a half-dozen Senate Republicans have already raised concerns about various proposals in the tax measure , setting the stage for arduous negotiations in the upper chamber .
Senate GOP leaders have assured their colleagues that the Senate Finance Committee will write its own bill and urged them to withhold judgment on the House measure .
“ They ’ ve told us the House bill is just a shell and we ’ ll have our own bill . They ’ ve asked to hold off on commenting and to not pick it apart , ” said a Republican senator summarizing the instructions that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison ( Mitch ) Mitchell McConnellMcConnell : Communist Party 's methods a 'tragedy ' for Chinese people Trump congratulates China on anniversary as GOP lawmakers decry communist rule Appeals court upholds net neutrality repeal but rules FCC ca n't block state laws MORE ( R-Ky. ) gave during a Thursday lunch meeting .
The House Ways and Means Committee unveiled its tax bill Thursday morning . It quickly came under fire for setting a new tax rate for pass-through businesses and for limiting the mortgage interest deduction to the first $ 500,000 of debt .
Sen. Ron Johnson Ronald ( Ron ) Harold JohnsonKennedy announces bill banning family members of U.S. officials from profiting in Ukraine Intel community watchdog appears to push back on Trump allegations of changes to whistleblower rules GOP senators urge Barr to probe Clinton , Ukraine MORE ( R-Wis. ) is not happy with the formula the House bill sets for taxing pass-through businesses , which under current law pay taxes at the higher rates that individuals now pay .
The House bill would count 70 percent of a pass-through business ’ s revenue as wages , taxed at the individual rate , with the remaining 30 percent taxed as a return on capital at a new rate of 25 percent .
But Johnson argues that small businesses will wind up paying a blended rate of 35 percent , well in excess of the 20 percent tax rate the House bill sets for big companies classified as C-corporations .
“ One issue I know that has to be fixed is the whole issue with pass-throughs , ” said Johnson , who called the House language on small business taxation “ completely unacceptable . ”
Johnson , the former CEO of a plastics company , said his House colleagues don ’ t understand the impact of the proposed rate on business .
“ What you really have is a blended rate of about 35.5 percent . That ’ s a 15-percent differential ” between corporate and small-business rates , he said .
Juanita Duggan , president of the National Federation of Independent Business , on Thursday said the House bill “ leaves too many small businesses behind . ”
Another provision raising red flags in the Senate is a proposal to limit the mortgage interest deduction to the first $ 500,000 of mortgage debt ; the threshold is now set at $ 1 million . The new standard would not be retroactive , applying only to newly purchased homes .
The National Association of Home Builders has panned the House bill , saying it gives large corporations a tax break at the expense of middle-class homeowners .
Sen. Tim Scott Timothy ( Tim ) Eugene ScottBottom Line Republicans show signs of discomfort in defense of Trump Entrepreneurs create most new jobs : Why are n't we talking about them ? MORE ( R-S.C. ) , a member of the Finance Committee , says mortgages over $ 500,000 are common in expensive housing markets in California , New York and the District of Columbia .
“ I prefer that it be higher , ” he said . “ In California , New Jersey , D.C. , the definition of the average house is going to be significantly higher [ in price ] with a whole lot less square footage . ”
“ I want to make sure that we ’ re not penalizing those folks who live in places with high valuation which leads to higher loan values , ” Scott said .
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch Orrin Grant HatchTrump to award racing legend Roger Penske with Presidential Medal of Freedom Trump awards Presidential Medal of Freedom to economist , former Reagan adviser Arthur Laffer Second ex-Senate staffer charged in aiding doxxing of GOP senators MORE ( R-Utah ) said of the House proposal to lower the mortgage interest tax deduction limit , “ I ’ m not sure that is going to fly . ”
But whittling away at the offsets that pay for the bill is going to draw scrutiny from fiscal hawks such as Sens . Bob Corker Robert ( Bob ) Phillips CorkerTrump announces , endorses ambassador to Japan 's Tennessee Senate bid Meet the key Senate player in GOP fight over Saudi Arabia Trump says he 's 'very happy ' some GOP senators have 'gone on to greener pastures ' MORE ( R-Tenn. ) and Jeff Flake Jeffrey ( Jeff ) Lane FlakeFlake tells GOP : Trump 'does not deserve reelection ' Republicans show signs of discomfort in defense of Trump Cindy McCain : I can see Arizona 'going Democrat ' in 2020 MORE ( R-Ariz. ) , who want to make sure the estimated cost of the bill isn ’ t kept in check with accounting gimmicks .
Two key middle-class tax credits in the House bill , the non-child dependent tax credit and the family-flexibility credit would phase out after five years to reduce the projected cost .
A major business tax break that would allow companies to immediately claim 100 percent expensing for capital investment would also sunset in five years .
Skeptical lawmakers are questioning how realistic that timeline is , as there would be intense pressure to renew the popular tax credits .

“ We ’ re still kind of working through the rate structure over here and we ’ ll see where we end up , ” he said .","The House GOP tax-reform package has put Senate Republicans in a tough spot, much like the House-passed ObamaCare repeal bill did earlier this year.

The legislation is expected to pass the House, starting a tougher battle in the Senate, where Republicans control 52 seats and can’t pass a bill if they suffer more than two defections and Democrats remain unified.



At least a half-dozen Senate Republicans have already raised concerns about various proposals in the tax measure, setting the stage for arduous negotiations in the upper chamber.

Senate GOP leaders have assured their colleagues that the Senate Finance Committee will write its own bill and urged them to withhold judgment on the House measure.

“They’ve told us the House bill is just a shell and we’ll have our own bill. They’ve asked to hold off on commenting and to not pick it apart,” said a Republican senator summarizing the instructions that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellMcConnell: Communist Party's methods a 'tragedy' for Chinese people Trump congratulates China on anniversary as GOP lawmakers decry communist rule Appeals court upholds net neutrality repeal but rules FCC can't block state laws MORE (R-Ky.) gave during a Thursday lunch meeting.

The House Ways and Means Committee unveiled its tax bill Thursday morning. It quickly came under fire for setting a new tax rate for pass-through businesses and for limiting the mortgage interest deduction to the first $500,000 of debt.

Sen. Ron Johnson Ronald (Ron) Harold JohnsonKennedy announces bill banning family members of U.S. officials from profiting in Ukraine Intel community watchdog appears to push back on Trump allegations of changes to whistleblower rules GOP senators urge Barr to probe Clinton, Ukraine MORE (R-Wis.) is not happy with the formula the House bill sets for taxing pass-through businesses, which under current law pay taxes at the higher rates that individuals now pay.

The House bill would count 70 percent of a pass-through business’s revenue as wages, taxed at the individual rate, with the remaining 30 percent taxed as a return on capital at a new rate of 25 percent.

But Johnson argues that small businesses will wind up paying a blended rate of 35 percent, well in excess of the 20 percent tax rate the House bill sets for big companies classified as C-corporations.

“One issue I know that has to be fixed is the whole issue with pass-throughs,” said Johnson, who called the House language on small business taxation “completely unacceptable.”

Johnson, the former CEO of a plastics company, said his House colleagues don’t understand the impact of the proposed rate on business.

“What you really have is a blended rate of about 35.5 percent. That’s a 15-percent differential” between corporate and small-business rates, he said.

Juanita Duggan, president of the National Federation of Independent Business, on Thursday said the House bill “leaves too many small businesses behind.”

Another provision raising red flags in the Senate is a proposal to limit the mortgage interest deduction to the first $500,000 of mortgage debt; the threshold is now set at $1 million. The new standard would not be retroactive, applying only to newly purchased homes.

The National Association of Home Builders has panned the House bill, saying it gives large corporations a tax break at the expense of middle-class homeowners.



Sen. Tim Scott Timothy (Tim) Eugene ScottBottom Line Republicans show signs of discomfort in defense of Trump Entrepreneurs create most new jobs: Why aren't we talking about them? MORE (R-S.C.), a member of the Finance Committee, says mortgages over $500,000 are common in expensive housing markets in California, New York and the District of Columbia.

“I prefer that it be higher,” he said. “In California, New Jersey, D.C., the definition of the average house is going to be significantly higher [in price] with a whole lot less square footage.”

“I want to make sure that we’re not penalizing those folks who live in places with high valuation which leads to higher loan values,” Scott said.

But whittling away at the offsets that pay for the bill is going to draw scrutiny from fiscal hawks such as Sens. Bob Corker Robert (Bob) Phillips CorkerTrump announces, endorses ambassador to Japan's Tennessee Senate bid Meet the key Senate player in GOP fight over Saudi Arabia Trump says he's 'very happy' some GOP senators have 'gone on to greener pastures' MORE (R-Tenn.) and Jeff Flake Jeffrey (Jeff) Lane FlakeFlake tells GOP: Trump 'does not deserve reelection' Republicans show signs of discomfort in defense of Trump Cindy McCain: I can see Arizona 'going Democrat' in 2020 MORE (R-Ariz.), who want to make sure the estimated cost of the bill isn’t kept in check with accounting gimmicks.

“I don’t want to balloon the deficit,” Flake said.

Two key middle-class tax credits in the House bill, the non-child dependent tax credit and the family-flexibility credit would phase out after five years to reduce the projected cost.

A major business tax break that would allow companies to immediately claim 100 percent expensing for capital investment would also sunset in five years.

Skeptical lawmakers are questioning how realistic that timeline is, as there would be intense pressure to renew the popular tax credits.

Senate Republicans are also raising concerns over the new tax brackets set up by the House bill.

David Perdue (Ga.), Steve Daines Steven (Steve) David DainesConservatives offer stark warning to Trump, GOP on background checks The 23 Republicans who opposed Trump-backed budget deal 5 takeaways from combative Democratic debate MORE (Mont.), Lisa Murkowski Lisa Ann MurkowskiRepublicans show signs of discomfort in defense of Trump GOP battens down the hatches after release of Trump whistleblower complaint Overnight Defense — Presented by Huntington Ingalls Industries — Furor over White House readout of Ukraine call | Dems seize on memo in impeachment push | Senate votes to end Trump emergency | Congress gets briefing on Iran MORE (Alaska) and Susan Collins Susan Margaret CollinsYes, President Trump, we do have a homelessness crisis and you're making it harder for us to address The policy-driven presidential campaign could be drowned out by impeachment Flake tells GOP: Trump 'does not deserve reelection' MORE (Maine), have balked at raising the rate for the lowest income bracket from 10 percent to 12 percent.

Securing congressional passage of his tax plan is critically important to Trump, who has yet to get major legislation through Congress since taking office in January, including a healthcare overhaul he promised as a candidate last year.

Senator Kamala Harris , Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , Robert Reich — Democrats are truly testing our prowess in 2019 ’ s championship round of that peerless political parlor game , “ Dumb or Dishonest ? ”
We don ’ t play that game when it comes to the great blithering demos at the center of our democracy , because we already know the answer : stone-cold stupid .

As a result of which , the people who got a tax cut got a tax cut right then , their paychecks getting a little bigger as Uncle Stupid skimmed off a little less .
At the end of the year , people who had had less money withheld in taxes faced a terrible new reality : They had had less money withheld in taxes ! They owed less , and they paid less , and , because the government did a surprisingly effective job of matching up what was withheld to what was owed , taxpayers got smaller returns . Which is to say , they got their money right away rather than having to wait for a tax refund after making the government an interest-free loan .
Getting paid , more or less in full , right now instead of waiting months and months : Naturally , taxpayers are enraged .
And along comes Senator Harris . Senator Harris , who might be as dumb as nine chickens or might be a cynical political operator who believes that her constituents are dumber than nine chickens — a supposition for which her election presents compelling evidence — complained on behalf of the morons she represents , writing : “ The average tax refund is down about $ 170 compared to last year . Let ’ s call the President ’ s tax cut what it is : a middle-class tax hike to line the pockets of already wealthy corporations and the 1 % . ”
Nope . Wrong on every count . She couldn ’ t have written a wronger take if she had tried . Refunds are down ( to the extent that they are down , more below ) because withholding is down , and most taxpayers , according to the government ’ s figures — and maybe Senator Harris knows someone in government she could ask ? — are paying lower taxes . Those refunds aren ’ t disappearing into the pockets of the hated 1 percent — most of whom would not break stride to bend over and pick up Mr. 50th Percentile ’ s federal income-tax payments should they happen step over them on the sidewalk — because they already have disappeared into the pockets of the taxpayers currently bitching about their diminished returns .
But it gets better : The talking point about tax refunds being down was based on early and incomplete data . It isn ’ t even clear that the average refund actually will be lower once all the refunds are processed . But , if they aren ’ t lower , then the IRS messed up . Lower refunds are the right outcome .
Representative Ocasio-Cortez — and , in her case , I ’ m leaning toward “ dumber than that weird little runt heel of bologna left over when the deli guy is done slicing , when you ’ re buying bologna for some reason ” — played a similar class-warfare game when she complained about “ giving ” Amazon $ 3 billion that instead could be invested in filling potholes and such , apparently being in a state of pristine ignorance about what a tax credit is . Very few things bring out the stupidity in a creature of politics like tax credits .
Streaking into the scene like a blazing comet of asininity comes Robert Reich , the gormless lawyer who plays an economist on television , who sets those lower individual returns — lower returns because the money was never taken away in the first place — against the gigantic tax returns coming to General Motors and Ford . “ While millions of Americans have seen their refunds shrink , ” Reich writes , “ some of the most profitable corporations in the country are filing for massive refunds . ”
There are two things at play there : One is that the corporate tax system is not very much like the individual tax system , because it takes into account that businesses have profitable years and money-losing years , and our law allows businesses to carry forward losses against future profits for tax purposes . It ’ s a way of smoothing out , if not exactly averaging , earnings for tax purposes . ( Some other countries extend this benefit to individuals in their tax codes , and it isn ’ t an obviously terrible idea . ) General Motors lost a ton of money in the years leading up to its bankruptcy — hence the bankruptcy — and so it has a lot of losses available to offset future earnings . Ford had some pretty hairy years , too . Now , maybe you think that ’ s a bad idea , and that businesses should be hit up for taxes in their profitable years without taking into account their money-losing years — that ’ s not an indefensible idea , but that isn ’ t how the United States ( or much of the rest of the world ) has done it for a long time , and businesses aren ’ t exploiting “ loopholes ” or engaging in shenanigans when they avail themselves of the benefits of the law . They are following the law not only as it is written but also as it is intended . Carrying losses forward has been around for ages — the practice has nothing to do with the 2019 tax cuts .
Likewise , the tax credits . Government uses tax credits to encourage businesses to behave in certain ways . Want more “ alternative ” energy ? The Obama administration couldn ’ t get enough tax credits for that . Tax credits are also used to encourage hiring — with the support of Robert Reich himself , who once blasted Congress for having “ repeatedly rejected tax incentives designed to encourage more hiring ” — and to subsidize lines of business that the federal government , in its wisdom , judges to be more important , usually manufacturing or things related to it , such as research and development or physical capital and infrastructure improvements . It would not be fair to say that Reich is an uncritical or categorical supporter of such tax incentives , but , then , neither are most Republicans , who can see crony capitalism clearly enough when the benefits are going to Democrats . But the idea of using tax credits to encourage this or that corporate behavior enjoys wide general bipartisan support — until some company like GM or Ford actually uses the tax credits ! On Monday , it ’ s , “ Hooray , tax credits ! ” On Tuesday , it ’ s “ Why are these evil corporations allowed to use these stupid tax credits we created yesterday with the best of all intentions ? ”","Sen.

Tales of taxation

Senator Kamala Harris, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Robert Reich — Democrats are truly testing our prowess in 2019’s championship round of that peerless political parlor game, “Dumb or Dishonest?”

We don’t play that game when it comes to the great blithering demos at the center of our democracy, because we already know the answer: stone-cold stupid. The American voter bears out the wisdom of the managerial proverb: “None of us is as dumb as all of us.” At the moment, voters are cheesed off because they got a tax cut and because the federal government acted, for once, with uncharacteristic directness and speed.

When the Republican tax bill lowered taxes for the great majority of taxpayers — all but about 4 million, as the hilariously named Government Accountability Office runs the numbers — the IRS got a move on and changed the withholding schedules. As a result of which, the people who got a tax cut got a tax cut right then, their paychecks getting a little bigger as Uncle Stupid skimmed off a little less.

You can see where this is going.

At the end of the year, people who had had less money withheld in taxes faced a terrible new reality: They had had less money withheld in taxes! They owed less, and they paid less, and, because the government did a surprisingly effective job of matching up what was withheld to what was owed, taxpayers got smaller returns. Which is to say, they got their money right away rather than having to wait for a tax refund after making the government an interest-free loan.

Getting paid, more or less in full, right now instead of waiting months and months: Naturally, taxpayers are enraged.

Representative Ocasio-Cortez — and, in her case, I’m leaning toward “dumber than that weird little runt heel of bologna left over when the deli guy is done slicing, when you’re buying bologna for some reason” — played a similar class-warfare game when she complained about “giving” Amazon $3 billion that instead could be invested in filling potholes and such, apparently being in a state of pristine ignorance about what a tax credit is. Very few things bring out the stupidity in a creature of politics like tax credits.

Streaking into the scene like a blazing comet of asininity comes Robert Reich, the gormless lawyer who plays an economist on television, who sets those lower individual returns — lower returns because the money was never taken away in the first place — against the gigantic tax returns coming to General Motors and Ford. “While millions of Americans have seen their refunds shrink,” Reich writes, “some of the most profitable corporations in the country are filing for massive refunds.”

Indeed, they are.

There are two things at play there: One is that the corporate tax system is not very much like the individual tax system, because it takes into account that businesses have profitable years and money-losing years, and our law allows businesses to carry forward losses against future profits for tax purposes. It’s a way of smoothing out, if not exactly averaging, earnings for tax purposes. (Some other countries extend this benefit to individuals in their tax codes, and it isn’t an obviously terrible idea.) General Motors lost a ton of money in the years leading up to its bankruptcy — hence the bankruptcy — and so it has a lot of losses available to offset future earnings. Ford had some pretty hairy years, too. Now, maybe you think that’s a bad idea, and that businesses should be hit up for taxes in their profitable years without taking into account their money-losing years — that’s not an indefensible idea, but that isn’t how the United States (or much of the rest of the world) has done it for a long time, and businesses aren’t exploiting “loopholes” or engaging in shenanigans when they avail themselves of the benefits of the law. They are following the law not only as it is written but also as it is intended. Carrying losses forward has been around for ages — the practice has nothing to do with the 2019 tax cuts.

Likewise, the tax credits. Government uses tax credits to encourage businesses to behave in certain ways. Want more “alternative” energy? The Obama administration couldn’t get enough tax credits for that. Tax credits are also used to encourage hiring — with the support of Robert Reich himself, who once blasted Congress for having “repeatedly rejected tax incentives designed to encourage more hiring” — and to subsidize lines of business that the federal government, in its wisdom, judges to be more important, usually manufacturing or things related to it, such as research and development or physical capital and infrastructure improvements. It would not be fair to say that Reich is an uncritical or categorical supporter of such tax incentives, but, then, neither are most Republicans, who can see crony capitalism clearly enough when the benefits are going to Democrats. But the idea of using tax credits to encourage this or that corporate behavior enjoys wide general bipartisan support — until some company like GM or Ford actually uses the tax credits! On Monday, it’s, “Hooray, tax credits!” On Tuesday, it’s “Why are these evil corporations allowed to use these stupid tax credits we created yesterday with the best of all intentions?”

They failed .
The Senate plan causes about 13 million fewer people to have health insurance by repealing the individual mandate and hurting enrollment in both Medicaid and Obamacare exchanges . That will , according to the best evidence we have , lead to an increase in preventable deaths on the order of 15,600 people per year . It will also increase individual health insurance premiums even for people who still do purchase insurance .
By 2027 , poor and middle-class people will see their taxes go up across the board . People making between $ 10,000 and $ 20,000 a year , the working poor , will see their income go down by 1.5 percent . Millionaires will see their income go up by 0.4 percent :
Even before major individual tax provisions expire at the end of 2025 , the bill raises taxes on a significant share of people . In 2018 , economist Ernie Tedeschi estimates that 11 percent of taxpayers will be paying more . The bill ’ s tweaks to tax brackets , doubling of the standard deduction , elimination of personal exemptions , and expansion of the child tax credit interact in sometimes unpredictable ways . Some families win , but others lose . Even in the early years , it ’ s not an across-the-board tax cut .
The bill cuts alcohol taxes on wine , beer , and liquor . We know that alcohol taxes are effective at reducing drunk driving , violent crime , and liver cirrhosis , and that increasing them saves thousands of lives a year . Raising the cost of a six-pack of Bud Light by 50 cents could save 2,000 to 6,000 lives every year . So cutting alcohol taxes , as the tax bill does , will likely increase preventable deaths in the US significantly .
Here ’ s the thing , though : Whatever the goal Republicans have , it didn ’ t have to be achieved this way . There is for each and every purpose a better bill that could be written .
Suppose Republicans wanted an across-the-board tax cut that helped both middle-class and rich people . They could ’ ve simply cut the 10 percent tax bracket to 8 percent , or that plus cut the 15 percent bracket to 12 percent . That helps middle- and upper-class people ( though not the poor ) and creates no losers . If they wanted to conform to Senate rules , they could have it all expire after eight or 10 years , just as the current legislation does . If they wanted to make it permanent , and cared deeply enough , they could ’ ve gone nuclear on the filibuster and passed a permanent cut with 51 votes .
But Republicans also want a lower , permanent corporate tax rate . Also doable : You can finance substantial rate cuts by removing tax breaks from the corporate code . Robert Pozen at Harvard Business School has estimated that eliminating the deductibility of interest payments on corporate debt would enable a cut in the corporate rate from 35 percent to 15 percent . If you wanted to , at the same time , allow 100 percent deductibility of all investments at the time they ’ re made , the rate would have to go up somewhat . But you could definitely cut the corporate rate , and pay for it permanently , by eliminating certain deductions and broadening the base . You don ’ t have to raise taxes or take away health care from middle-class people .
Republicans have grander aspirations than that , however . If you read the “ Better Way ” tax framework released by House Speaker Paul Ryan and House Ways and Means Chair Kevin Brady in 2016 , you ’ ll see page after page of arguments for transitioning away from taxing income to taxing consumption . A lot of economists agree with that goal , even progressive ones ( though others insist taxing consumption is inherently regressive ) .
Luckily there ’ s a plan in Congress that achieves that goal , is revenue-neutral , and doesn ’ t raise taxes on the poor or middle class . It ’ s Sen. Ben Cardin ’ s ( D-MD ) Progressive Consumption Tax Act . Cardin would exempt the first $ 100,000 of income for couples from income tax ( $ 50,000 for singles , $ 75,000 for single parents ) , meaning that the vast majority of people would no longer pay income taxes . He 'd consolidate rates to three — 15 , 25 , and 28 percent — and cut the corporate tax to 17 percent . That 's a lower top individual rate , and a lower corporate rate , than the Senate is proposing . To pay for it , he 'd introduce a value-added tax , the kind of consumption tax used in most other rich countries , and add a rebate so that poor people don ’ t see their taxes go up .
The plan , based on a proposal by Columbia tax law professor Michael Graetz , accomplishes basically all of Republicans ’ substantive tax reform goals . It lowers income tax rates , and dramatically lowers the corporate tax . By exempting the majority of Americans from income taxes , it reduces the importance of deductions and credits . And it shifts the tax burden to consumption by adding a VAT .
But unlike the Senate or House tax bills , it doesn ’ t increase the deficit , and it ’ s not regressive . The Tax Policy Center modeled the Graetz plan back in 2013 with a VAT rate of 12.9 percent , and slightly tweaked individual tax brackets ( 14 , 27 , and 31 ) . TPC found that it would cost $ 0 . It ’ s completely revenue-neutral . And it 's progressive . The top 0.1 percent would see their income fall by 0.9 percent , and the poorest fifth would see their income grow by 1.2 percent .
If Republicans really want to give needy people a tax cut while shifting the tax code to consumption and lowering individual and corporate tax rates , there ’ s your plan . You can work with Cardin on putting together a passable version right now .
Perhaps a VAT is too dramatic a step . I have a plan for then , too ! Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden has for years put out bipartisan tax reform plans , first with Sen. Judd Gregg ( R-NH ) and then with Sen. Dan Coats ( R-IN ) , who have both since left the body . The plan sets a top rate of 35 percent , lowers the corporate tax rate to 24 percent , and , according to a 2010 analysis from the Tax Policy Center , would have made the tax code slightly more progressive . That analysis came before some of the high-income Bush tax cuts were revived , so the effect relative to today 's laws would be different . But it ’ s a model for a way to cut corporate rates and simplify the code while not making the tax code more regressive .
Republicans have to ask themselves what they ’ re in this for
I don ’ t know what ’ s in the hearts of Orrin Hatch or Kevin Brady or Paul Ryan or Mitch McConnell . I don ’ t like to assume malign motives of politicians , even ones I vehemently disagree with .

Here's What They Get Wrong,2015-09-28,Danielle Kurtzleben,"Lots Of Candidates Want To Simplify Tax Code ; Here 's What They Get Wrong
There 's something almost Name That Tune-ish about the way the GOP candidates are talking about tax brackets these days . Currently , there are seven . Donald Trump wants four . Jeb Bush says he can get them down to three . Chris Christie and Marco Rubio want two . Ben Carson does them one better — one 10 percent rate , inspired by the Bible .
They 're not alone — President Obama has advocated fewer brackets as well .
Why do this ? One of the most common reasons they give is that it would make the tax code `` simpler . ''
As Rubio 's tax plan puts it : `` The tax code is in desperate need of simplification , and bracket consolidation is an important first step . ''
He 's right on the first part : The Internal Revenue Code is impenetrably , unfathomably complicated .
But here 's the reality : Cutting brackets wo n't really help that much .
`` It 's a very mild form of simplification , '' said William Gale , co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Brookings Institution , a left-leaning Washington think tank . `` The real complication in the system is in the tax base , not in the rate structure . Figuring out how you calculate capital gains or figuring out whether you 're eligible for the [ earned income tax credit for lower-income Americans ] , given the child rules — once you 've got that , then you just plug in the rates . ''
Think about your own taxes — it can be complicated to figure out how much you owe when you have things like investment income , wages from self-employment or lots of deductions . But once you fill in the boxes and subtract all that out , figuring out your rate is easy ( and if you 're using a program like TurboTax , the computer does it for you ) .
Cutting taxes as a whole tends to be the real goal behind rate-cutting , said Ed Kleinbard , professor of law and business at the University of Southern California . After all , no one ever tries to simplify tax brackets upward .
`` The number of brackets has an almost imperceptible effect on the complexity of tax law as it is lived by the individual taxpayer , '' Kleinbard said . `` Taxpayers are not , left to their own devices , engaged in high-level mathematics . ''
So reducing the number of brackets is n't the clearest path to simplification . What is ? Making the rest of your tax preparation experience easier , says one expert .
`` [ Simplification ] does not necessarily mean that taxes are a simple mathematical function of income , '' said Matthew Weinzierl , a Harvard University assistant professor , who studies what optimal tax systems look like . `` After all , with TurboTax it 's easy to have a computer do a complex calculation for you . Instead , what economists typically have in mind is that a tax system should be easy to understand , transparent and hard to game . ''
A lot of these bracket-cutting ideas come alongside proposals to limit deductions . And that , in its own right , is a great step toward simplification . Bush , for example , wants to cap the amount of total deductions most people can take ( not counting the charitable deduction ) .
`` Most economists think a tax base with fewer such loopholes is less subject to evasion and less distortionary to economic activity , '' Weinzierl said .
The idea is that these loophole closures offset the tax revenue lost from cutting brackets . But that 's not how it always works .
`` The call for fewer tax brackets in every case has as its real motive lowering the tax burden on the highest-income Americans , not making life simpler for the middle class , '' Kleinbard argued . Consider Bush 's tax proposal as an example . While it limits deductions , it also would overwhelmingly benefit the highest earners ( and grow the national debt — unless there is unprecedented growth in the economy ) .
Cutting deductions and loopholes makes for a great sound bite , but it 's far tougher than it sounds . The politically popular mortgage-interest deduction is a great example of this . It tends to benefit higher earners more , but despite constant calls to `` simplify '' the tax code , it 's so politically popular that it has proved impossible to eliminate .
Cutting deductions is n't the only way candidates could fight for simpler taxes . They could also pledge to combat efforts of tax preparers to keep tax preparation itself complicated . Vox 's Dylan Matthews and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities ' Robert Greenstein have reported that H & R Block pushed for changes that would have quadrupled the earned income tax credit form 's length , making it harder for low-income families to get the credit ( that is , without H & R Block 's help ) . ( The company has defended itself here . )
There are also unsexy opportunities to make the code less complicated . For example , Kleinbard argues that some long , hyperspecific definitions could be trimmed down .
`` If you really care about complexity , the place to look , for example , is the definition of who 's a dependent , '' Kleinbard said . `` People fight over whether a child is a dependent of one parent or another . It turns out to be an incredibly complicated topic , and nonsensically so . If you look for simplicity , you 'd actually want to look at things like a consistent and simple definition of 'dependent . ' ``
So there 's plenty of room for simplification , and politicians often point to the so-called 70,000 page tax code as proof of that . However , railing against the page count may be a misguided line of attack .
One ( nitpicky ) reason is that the tax code itself is not , in fact , 70,000 pages long , as Slate pointed out last year . That distinction belongs to a compilation of court decisions surrounding the tax code , according to the Tax Foundation . The statutes themselves are about 2,700 pages long .
But far more important , Kleinbard said , some complexity is inherent to a tax code that tries to govern a complicated economy .
`` The tax code is thousands of pages long for a very simple reason : It is a model , in the economic sense , of all of economic activity , '' he said . `` Most Americans do n't spend a lot of time worrying about the taxation of cutting timber or of being crew on a tuna boat . But there are rules for that , and you may find the rules irrelevant to you , but the rules are complex for a reason . ''
Americans want a tax code that 's simpler to some degree . And brackets are n't really going to simplify the code all that much . But that still does n't answer one key question : Is there a `` right '' number of brackets ?
There 's an entire branch of economics dedicated to this kind of question . ( It 's called optimal tax theory , and Google Scholar-searching it will dump you into an afternoon-long intellectual rabbit hole . ) Weinzierl , who studies this , said there 's no magic number .
`` The number of brackets is generally considered unimportant , '' Weinzierl said . `` Any desired level of progressivity can be obtained with a number of different bracket structures , so the specific number is n't that important . ''
But some experts believe that our current seven-bracket system could use some tweaking . Thomas Piketty ( author of last year 's best-selling Capital in the 21st Century ) and University of California , Berkeley 's Emmanuel Saez , for example , have argued that a higher top marginal rate would be best .
Given the growth of uber-high-earners , Weinzierl said , that idea is popular among economists .
`` Many economists would argue that the lack of such a bracket is odd , since it means that a family earning $ 750,000 is likely to pay the same marginal tax rate as a family earning 10 times as much , '' he said . The basic idea here , he adds , is that `` if we 're going to have more than one bracket , and thus allow ourselves something other than a flat tax , it 's quite limiting not to have a bracket for the highest earners . ''
And here 's another compelling complication : The U.S. may have already stumbled onto a pretty good system . Earlier this year , economists at the Minneapolis Fed found that the current U.S. system , warts and all , is , in fact , `` nearly optimal , '' beating out other `` optimal '' options like a flat-tax-plus-transfer system .
Trying to understand all of these tax-policy contradictions at once might ( understandably ) make your eyes glaze over .

There's something almost Name That Tune-ish about the way the GOP candidates are talking about tax brackets these days. Currently, there are seven. Donald Trump wants four. Jeb Bush says he can get them down to three. Chris Christie and Marco Rubio want two. Ben Carson does them one better — one 10 percent rate, inspired by the Bible.

They're not alone — President Obama has advocated fewer brackets as well.

Why do this? One of the most common reasons they give is that it would make the tax code ""simpler.""

As Rubio's tax plan puts it: ""The tax code is in desperate need of simplification, and bracket consolidation is an important first step.""

He's right on the first part: The Internal Revenue Code is impenetrably, unfathomably complicated.

But here's the reality: Cutting brackets won't really help that much.

""It's a very mild form of simplification,"" said William Gale, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Brookings Institution, a left-leaning Washington think tank. ""The real complication in the system is in the tax base, not in the rate structure. Figuring out how you calculate capital gains or figuring out whether you're eligible for the [earned income tax credit for lower-income Americans], given the child rules — once you've got that, then you just plug in the rates.""

Think about your own taxes — it can be complicated to figure out how much you owe when you have things like investment income, wages from self-employment or lots of deductions. But once you fill in the boxes and subtract all that out, figuring out your rate is easy (and if you're using a program like TurboTax, the computer does it for you).

Cutting taxes as a whole tends to be the real goal behind rate-cutting, said Ed Kleinbard, professor of law and business at the University of Southern California. After all, no one ever tries to simplify tax brackets upward.

""The number of brackets has an almost imperceptible effect on the complexity of tax law as it is lived by the individual taxpayer,"" Kleinbard said. ""Taxpayers are not, left to their own devices, engaged in high-level mathematics.""

What does simplicity look like?

So reducing the number of brackets isn't the clearest path to simplification. What is? Making the rest of your tax preparation experience easier, says one expert.

""[Simplification] does not necessarily mean that taxes are a simple mathematical function of income,"" said Matthew Weinzierl, a Harvard University assistant professor, who studies what optimal tax systems look like. ""After all, with TurboTax it's easy to have a computer do a complex calculation for you. Instead, what economists typically have in mind is that a tax system should be easy to understand, transparent and hard to game.""

A lot of these bracket-cutting ideas come alongside proposals to limit deductions. And that, in its own right, is a great step toward simplification. Bush, for example, wants to cap the amount of total deductions most people can take (not counting the charitable deduction).

""Most economists think a tax base with fewer such loopholes is less subject to evasion and less distortionary to economic activity,"" Weinzierl said.

The idea is that these loophole closures offset the tax revenue lost from cutting brackets. But that's not how it always works.

""The call for fewer tax brackets in every case has as its real motive lowering the tax burden on the highest-income Americans, not making life simpler for the middle class,"" Kleinbard argued. Consider Bush's tax proposal as an example. While it limits deductions, it also would overwhelmingly benefit the highest earners (and grow the national debt — unless there is unprecedented growth in the economy).

Cutting deductions and loopholes makes for a great sound bite, but it's far tougher than it sounds. The politically popular mortgage-interest deduction is a great example of this. It tends to benefit higher earners more, but despite constant calls to ""simplify"" the tax code, it's so politically popular that it has proved impossible to eliminate.

Cutting deductions isn't the only way candidates could fight for simpler taxes. They could also pledge to combat efforts of tax preparers to keep tax preparation itself complicated. Vox's Dylan Matthews and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities' Robert Greenstein have reported that H&R Block pushed for changes that would have quadrupled the earned income tax credit form's length, making it harder for low-income families to get the credit (that is, without H&R Block's help). (The company has defended itself here.)

There are also unsexy opportunities to make the code less complicated. For example, Kleinbard argues that some long, hyperspecific definitions could be trimmed down.

""If you really care about complexity, the place to look, for example, is the definition of who's a dependent,"" Kleinbard said. ""People fight over whether a child is a dependent of one parent or another. It turns out to be an incredibly complicated topic, and nonsensically so. If you look for simplicity, you'd actually want to look at things like a consistent and simple definition of 'dependent.' ""

So there's plenty of room for simplification, and politicians often point to the so-called 70,000 page tax code as proof of that. However, railing against the page count may be a misguided line of attack.

One (nitpicky) reason is that the tax code itself is not, in fact, 70,000 pages long, as Slate pointed out last year. That distinction belongs to a compilation of court decisions surrounding the tax code, according to the Tax Foundation. The statutes themselves are about 2,700 pages long.

But far more important, Kleinbard said, some complexity is inherent to a tax code that tries to govern a complicated economy.

""The tax code is thousands of pages long for a very simple reason: It is a model, in the economic sense, of all of economic activity,"" he said. ""Most Americans don't spend a lot of time worrying about the taxation of cutting timber or of being crew on a tuna boat. But there are rules for that, and you may find the rules irrelevant to you, but the rules are complex for a reason.""

OK, so how many brackets should there be?

Americans want a tax code that's simpler to some degree. And brackets aren't really going to simplify the code all that much. But that still doesn't answer one key question: Is there a ""right"" number of brackets?

Here's the unsatisfying answer: No.

There's an entire branch of economics dedicated to this kind of question. (It's called optimal tax theory, and Google Scholar-searching it will dump you into an afternoon-long intellectual rabbit hole.) Weinzierl, who studies this, said there's no magic number.

""The number of brackets is generally considered unimportant,"" Weinzierl said. ""Any desired level of progressivity can be obtained with a number of different bracket structures, so the specific number isn't that important.""

But some experts believe that our current seven-bracket system could use some tweaking. Thomas Piketty (author of last year's best-selling Capital in the 21st Century) and University of California, Berkeley's Emmanuel Saez, for example, have argued that a higher top marginal rate would be best.

Given the growth of uber-high-earners, Weinzierl said, that idea is popular among economists.

""Many economists would argue that the lack of such a bracket is odd, since it means that a family earning $750,000 is likely to pay the same marginal tax rate as a family earning 10 times as much,"" he said. The basic idea here, he adds, is that ""if we're going to have more than one bracket, and thus allow ourselves something other than a flat tax, it's quite limiting not to have a bracket for the highest earners.""

And here's another compelling complication: The U.S. may have already stumbled onto a pretty good system. Earlier this year, economists at the Minneapolis Fed found that the current U.S. system, warts and all, is, in fact, ""nearly optimal,"" beating out other ""optimal"" options like a flat-tax-plus-transfer system.

Trying to understand all of these tax-policy contradictions at once might (understandably) make your eyes glaze over. But the ultimate takeaway is simple: When a politician advocates simplifying the tax system, there's usually a good reason to be skeptical.

It was neither particularly new nor truly a “ plan , ” at least not in the way that word is typically used in presidential politics . It actually tells us less about where Trump wants to take the tax code than his campaign plan did , which bodes poorly for anyone who hoped Trump was serious about a sweeping , pro-growth overhaul of the system .
Americans went to the polls last November not knowing a lot of important details about Donald Trump ’ s promise to deliver what he said would be the largest tax cut in US history . They didn ’ t know how that plan would guard against a wave of tax-evasion by high earners , or how it keep from adding trillions of dollars to the national debt , or — and this seemed especially important — how it would avoid actually raising taxes on 25 million Americans .
Seven months have passed . Trump ’ s team has had a lot of time to fill in those blanks , which it promised to during the campaign but never did . But somehow , the one-page outline for tax reform that administration officials released on Wednesday managed to include fewer details than his campaign plan . It answered none of those questions from the fall , and it raised several new ones .
This is not how policymaking usually works — at least , not for policymakers who hope to pass actual laws .
“ We ’ re just in theatrics mode , even though there ’ s a chance to do something , ” said Alan Cole , an economist at the conservative Tax Foundation , whose colleagues declared on Wednesday that the new Trump outline did not include enough details for them to complete a full economic analysis of it .
Trump officials “ still think of , how does stuff play on cable news ? ” Cole added . “ They ’ ve built a culture that ’ s not ideologically predisposed to listening to someone who cares about little details . … It feels like we ’ re kind of in a perpetual campaign , and as a result , there ’ s no policy . ”
Skimping on details is a great way to undercut real reform
Cole , and many others like him , has high hopes for a truly bold tax reform bill — one that encourages growth , investment , and income gains across the economy . Many supply-side economists will tell you that to be effective , those reforms need to be permanent , and not set to expire after a few years , so that companies can invest and hire with confidence .
This is the first of many , many rubs for the Trump plan . To cut taxes permanently in Washington , you either need to clear 60 votes in the Senate , or you need to clear 50 , but not increase the deficit outside of a 10-year window . Trump appears to have done none of the outreach to Democrats that he would need to get 60 votes . That leaves the 50-vote route , via budget reconciliation , and the easiest way through it is designing a plan that Congress ’ s tax-scorers will deem revenue-neutral ( when accounting for a boost to economic growth from the cuts ) .
Trump is nowhere close to such a plan , going by the details he ’ s put forth . Doing some back-of-the-envelope math , Cole estimates he ’ s proposing around $ 2 trillion to $ 3 trillion in net tax cuts — rate cuts minus offsetting loophole closures . He thinks the plan might generate about $ 1 trillion in added revenues from growth . That would still leave Trump short .
Again , this is a rough estimate , and if anything it ’ s optimistic — it comes from a think tank that typically projects much higher growth gains from tax cuts than its peers .
Trump ’ s team could solve this , theoretically , by producing its own modeling showing massive growth effects from the plan . It could even persuade senators to adopt that model for the purposes of reconciliation . But — ugh , here it is again — you can ’ t model a plan without details .
You need to estimate , for example , how many high-earning workers might suddenly file their taxes as a so-called “ pass-through ” business in order to take advantage of the administration ’ s proposed 15 percent tax rate for such businesses and drastically cut their tax bills . The Trump team says it will limit that practice — restrict the rate to actual businesses , not workers who can declare themselves LLCs — but it won ’ t say how , and so , it ’ s impossible to predict how successful that limitation might be , which matters a lot for tax revenues .
“ Their answer to that is , no , trust us , we ’ ll fix it , ” said Harry Stein , the director of fiscal policy at the liberal Center for American Progress . Stein does not take that promise seriously . But , he said , “ I do take ( the plan ) seriously as an intent to enact enormous tax cuts for wealthy people and big corporations . ”
The plan leaves huge questions for the middle class , especially
This is another rub for Trump . His officials are selling the plan as a big boost to the middle class . But while the new outline is clear on its cuts for businesses , it does not specify the income thresholds for each of its three personal tax rates . It increases the standard deduction , though not by as much as Trump originally promised , and it eliminates most other deductions , but it also appears to eliminate some deductions that particularly benefit larger middle-class families with children .
That combination is what led Lily Batchelder , a New York University professor and former Obama economic adviser , to calculate the effects on the middle class . She said that some 25 million low- or middle-income families could see their taxes go up under Trump ’ s campaign proposal . To which Trump ’ s team responded , no , they won ’ t — our plan will ensure it .
Such assurances were nowhere to be found in the plan released on Wednesday .
After its release , Batchelder said in an interview that “ the changes announced today could have been written on a business card , ” but by carrying over some assumptions from the campaign plan , she could roughly estimate its effects .
“ It appears to me that it ’ s worse for the middle class , and that more working families will face a tax increase , ” she said . “ I , or many tax nerds , could have fixed this in a matter of hours . I don ’ t think it ’ s a lack of staff . It ’ s a lack of will . ”
In call after call with economic experts on Wednesday afternoon , no matter their ideology or party affiliation , this was the constant question : Why didn ’ t the administration sweat more of the small stuff ? Or even more of the big stuff ?
It appears “ they didn ’ t put much thought into this , and then last week , Trump announced they were doing a plan , ” said Stan Veuger , an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute .
“ It ’ s just not well done . I don ’ t know what else to say about it . It ’ s hard to tell what goal we ’ re working toward . ”
Trump has seen this move on Obamacare already , and it didn ’ t go well
On Wednesday , administration officials stressed the time and preparation that had gone into the plan before they rolled it out .
“ This is quite an historic day for us , and one that we have been looking forward to for a long time , ” said Gary Cohn , the head of the National Economic Council .
“ We ’ ve been working on this plan for a considerable amount of time , ” said Steven Mnuchin , the Treasury secretary .
And yet , Mnuchin swatted away request after request from reporters during a White House briefing on the plan , saying the administration would tell Americans more once it had reached a deal with Congress . `` You 're going into very micro details here , '' he told a questioner at one point .
If that sounds familiar , it ’ s because the administration took a similar tact on its effort to repeal and replace Obamacare .
Trump never detailed his preferences on the issue publicly , failed to unify Republicans around a bill , and has seen the issue languish in the House . Tax reform was supposed to go more smoothly for him , in part , Americans were assured , because Trump knows and cares more about tax policy than he does about health care . That attitude should worry boosters of reform .
There are lots of reasons why the country hasn ’ t seen a major tax reform effort pass Congress since 1986 . Presidential indifference to tax policy isn ’ t one of them . Every president since then has campaigned on a tax plan and worked , at least at the margins , to change tax policy .
True reform — and not temporary cuts , or tinkering around the edges of the code — requires that sort of deep knowledge from a president .

Trump ’ s new plan reflects none of those traits . That is why , unless he fleshes it out and answers the hard questions , it seems likely to fail .","The Trump administration, with great fanfare, rolled out a new tax plan on Wednesday. It was neither particularly new nor truly a “plan,” at least not in the way that word is typically used in presidential politics. It actually tells us less about where Trump wants to take the tax code than his campaign plan did, which bodes poorly for anyone who hoped Trump was serious about a sweeping, pro-growth overhaul of the system.

Americans went to the polls last November not knowing a lot of important details about Donald Trump’s promise to deliver what he said would be the largest tax cut in US history. They didn’t know how that plan would guard against a wave of tax-evasion by high earners, or how it keep from adding trillions of dollars to the national debt, or — and this seemed especially important — how it would avoid actually raising taxes on 25 million Americans.

Seven months have passed. Trump’s team has had a lot of time to fill in those blanks, which it promised to during the campaign but never did. But somehow, the one-page outline for tax reform that administration officials released on Wednesday managed to include fewer details than his campaign plan. It answered none of those questions from the fall, and it raised several new ones.

This is not how policymaking usually works — at least, not for policymakers who hope to pass actual laws.

“We’re just in theatrics mode, even though there’s a chance to do something,” said Alan Cole, an economist at the conservative Tax Foundation, whose colleagues declared on Wednesday that the new Trump outline did not include enough details for them to complete a full economic analysis of it.

Trump officials “still think of, how does stuff play on cable news?” Cole added. “They’ve built a culture that’s not ideologically predisposed to listening to someone who cares about little details. … It feels like we’re kind of in a perpetual campaign, and as a result, there’s no policy.”

Skimping on details is a great way to undercut real reform

Cole, and many others like him, has high hopes for a truly bold tax reform bill — one that encourages growth, investment, and income gains across the economy. Many supply-side economists will tell you that to be effective, those reforms need to be permanent, and not set to expire after a few years, so that companies can invest and hire with confidence.

This is the first of many, many rubs for the Trump plan. To cut taxes permanently in Washington, you either need to clear 60 votes in the Senate, or you need to clear 50, but not increase the deficit outside of a 10-year window. Trump appears to have done none of the outreach to Democrats that he would need to get 60 votes. That leaves the 50-vote route, via budget reconciliation, and the easiest way through it is designing a plan that Congress’s tax-scorers will deem revenue-neutral (when accounting for a boost to economic growth from the cuts).

Trump is nowhere close to such a plan, going by the details he’s put forth. Doing some back-of-the-envelope math, Cole estimates he’s proposing around $2 trillion to $3 trillion in net tax cuts — rate cuts minus offsetting loophole closures. He thinks the plan might generate about $1 trillion in added revenues from growth. That would still leave Trump short.

Again, this is a rough estimate, and if anything it’s optimistic — it comes from a think tank that typically projects much higher growth gains from tax cuts than its peers.

Trump’s team could solve this, theoretically, by producing its own modeling showing massive growth effects from the plan. It could even persuade senators to adopt that model for the purposes of reconciliation. But — ugh, here it is again — you can’t model a plan without details.

You need to estimate, for example, how many high-earning workers might suddenly file their taxes as a so-called “pass-through” business in order to take advantage of the administration’s proposed 15 percent tax rate for such businesses and drastically cut their tax bills. The Trump team says it will limit that practice — restrict the rate to actual businesses, not workers who can declare themselves LLCs — but it won’t say how, and so, it’s impossible to predict how successful that limitation might be, which matters a lot for tax revenues.

“Their answer to that is, no, trust us, we’ll fix it,” said Harry Stein, the director of fiscal policy at the liberal Center for American Progress. Stein does not take that promise seriously. But, he said, “I do take (the plan) seriously as an intent to enact enormous tax cuts for wealthy people and big corporations.”

The plan leaves huge questions for the middle class, especially

This is another rub for Trump. His officials are selling the plan as a big boost to the middle class. But while the new outline is clear on its cuts for businesses, it does not specify the income thresholds for each of its three personal tax rates. It increases the standard deduction, though not by as much as Trump originally promised, and it eliminates most other deductions, but it also appears to eliminate some deductions that particularly benefit larger middle-class families with children.

That combination is what led Lily Batchelder, a New York University professor and former Obama economic adviser, to calculate the effects on the middle class. She said that some 25 million low- or middle-income families could see their taxes go up under Trump’s campaign proposal. To which Trump’s team responded, no, they won’t — our plan will ensure it.

Such assurances were nowhere to be found in the plan released on Wednesday.

After its release, Batchelder said in an interview that “the changes announced today could have been written on a business card,” but by carrying over some assumptions from the campaign plan, she could roughly estimate its effects.

“It appears to me that it’s worse for the middle class, and that more working families will face a tax increase,” she said. “I, or many tax nerds, could have fixed this in a matter of hours. I don’t think it’s a lack of staff. It’s a lack of will.”

In call after call with economic experts on Wednesday afternoon, no matter their ideology or party affiliation, this was the constant question: Why didn’t the administration sweat more of the small stuff? Or even more of the big stuff?

It appears “they didn’t put much thought into this, and then last week, Trump announced they were doing a plan,” said Stan Veuger, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.

“It’s just not well done. I don’t know what else to say about it. It’s hard to tell what goal we’re working toward.”

Trump has seen this move on Obamacare already, and it didn’t go well

On Wednesday, administration officials stressed the time and preparation that had gone into the plan before they rolled it out.

“This is quite an historic day for us, and one that we have been looking forward to for a long time,” said Gary Cohn, the head of the National Economic Council.

“We’ve been working on this plan for a considerable amount of time,” said Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary.

And yet, Mnuchin swatted away request after request from reporters during a White House briefing on the plan, saying the administration would tell Americans more once it had reached a deal with Congress. ""You're going into very micro details here,"" he told a questioner at one point.

If that sounds familiar, it’s because the administration took a similar tact on its effort to repeal and replace Obamacare.

Trump never detailed his preferences on the issue publicly, failed to unify Republicans around a bill, and has seen the issue languish in the House. Tax reform was supposed to go more smoothly for him, in part, Americans were assured, because Trump knows and cares more about tax policy than he does about health care. That attitude should worry boosters of reform.

There are lots of reasons why the country hasn’t seen a major tax reform effort pass Congress since 1986. Presidential indifference to tax policy isn’t one of them. Every president since then has campaigned on a tax plan and worked, at least at the margins, to change tax policy.

True reform — and not temporary cuts, or tinkering around the edges of the code — requires that sort of deep knowledge from a president. It also requires attention to detail, in order to translate presidential priorities into real-world effects. It requires coalition building and public salesmanship. And it requires hard choices, angering some interest groups while pleasing others.

Allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire on income over $ 500,000 ( instead of $ 250,000 ) could raise at least $ 315 billion over a decade , according to Tax Policy Center data .

Another option : limit the after-tax value of certain tax breaks .
For example , lawmakers could enact an after-tax cap that applies to itemized deductions , plus the child tax-credit and the tax-free benefit workers receive when their employer helps pay for their health insurance .
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has done the math on that scenario .

So how do you get to $1 trillion in new tax revenue and ensure each party gets what it most wants? Here are two options.

Option A -- Raise rates and curb tax breaks

Democrats insist on raising rates on the rich. But would they compromise on how ""rich"" is defined?

Republicans don't want tax rates to go up. But would they accept higher rates on a small group of high-income people in a compromise that raised even more revenue by curbing tax breaks?

Bottom line: Raising rates on some high-income households in combination with a $50,000 cap on itemized deductions could raise anywhere from $732 billion to $1.064 trillion over a decade.

Option B -- Just curb tax breaks

If Democrats decide that raising tax burdens on the rich is a higher priority than raising rates, they may be able to work out a deal with Republicans strictly by limiting tax breaks.

Again the two sides could do it in ways that primarily affect the highest income households, which enjoy more than 40% of the benefits of all tax expenditures.
