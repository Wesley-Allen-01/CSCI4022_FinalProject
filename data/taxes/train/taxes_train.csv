Funding CHIP is a pittance next to the Republican tax cuts

On its face, it’s remarkable that Congress hasn’t yet found the money to extend CHIP for five years and take this headache away from them and the program’s families.

CHIP costs about $12 billion to $14 billion each year. But because the Congressional Budget Office assumes the program will remain indefinitely, even if it hasn’t been funded yet, it technically only “costs” about $8 billion to extend CHIP for five years. (This is wonky congressional budget math, but that’s how it shakes out.)

That is a minimal lift. Republicans just passed a $1 trillion corporate tax cut.

(A quick note on the tax bill’s child tax credit: Republicans have expanded it, but in such a way that the poorest families will see a minimal benefit. The bigger benefits will go to families with higher incomes.)

So Congress needs to find $8 billion in spending cuts (or new revenue) to fund CHIP for five years and erase any risk that a kid in the United States would be denied or lose health insurance. They had no problem approving a tax bill projected to balloon the federal deficit by $1 trillion over the next 10 years. Extending CHIP should be no problem. But it’s still not done.

But they did find time to rush a massive tax overhaul through the House and Senate in less than two months.

Republicans prioritized Obamacare repeal and tax cuts over CHIP

Let’s go back to mid-September, before CHIP’s funding had expired on October 1 and when advocates were warning Congress not to let the program lapse. It was already too late, even then, in their eyes.

""This is ridiculous,"" Alker said in September. ""We have never had a situation like this before.""

There was a deal, in principle, to extend the program for five years. Sens. Hatch and Ron Wyden (D-OR) had announced an agreement, though they still needed to work out some details, like how exactly to pay for it.

But around that same time, momentum for a last-ditch Obamacare repeal plan, Graham-Cassidy, was picking up. Senate Republican leaders devoted their next two weeks to whipping support for the plan, rushing to beat a September 30 deadline for the special “budget reconciliation” privileges they were using to advance the plan.

Otherwise, the work has been more or less on hold — but Republicans have managed to muscle through a generational tax overhaul in less than two months, when the last major tax reform bill, in 1986, took two years to produce.

They gleefully promised to deliver a big, beautiful tax cut for Christmas. And they did it. They made time to approve a record number of federal judges. They had time for their holiday parties, hosted by Washington lobbyists.

But Congress will leave town having done the absolute bare minimum to prevent an unprecedented disaster for CHIP. The funding that they are hoping to pass Thursday might not even last as long as they’d like — Lesley noted to me that $2.8 billion for a $12 billion-a-year program doesn’t seem like it would cover six months.

Congrats, fellow paranoiacs -- you were right. The AP reports:





The Internal Revenue Service inappropriately flagged conservative political groups for additional reviews during the 2012 election to see if they were violating their tax-exempt status, a top IRS official said Friday. Organizations were singled out because they included the words ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" in their applications for tax-exempt status, said Lois Lerner, who heads the IRS division that oversees tax-exempt groups. In some cases, groups were asked for their list of donors, which violates IRS policy in most cases, she said. ""That was wrong. That was absolutely incorrect, it was insensitive and it was inappropriate. That's not how we go about selecting cases for further review,"" Lerner said at a conference sponsored by the American Bar Association. ""The IRS would like to apologize for that,"" she added.

After her talk, she told The AP that no high level IRS officials knew about the practice. Agency officials found out about the practice last year and moved to correct it, the IRS said in a statement. The statement did not specify when officials found out.



Let me see if I'm understanding this correctly. We're told that (a) ""low level"" IRS workers in Cincinnati established the practice of deliberately flagging ""tea party"" and ""patriot"" groups for further scrutiny, (b) this was somehow not ""motivated by political bias,"" and (c) zero IRS higher-ups were aware that this was going on. What a tale. Did this become a national policy, or was it limited to southwest Ohio? The story linked above says that 75 different conservative groups were affected by this supposedly ""grassroots"" IRS procedure. Also, if the IRS brass discovered the malfeasance last year (coincidentally, an election year), why is the public just finding out about it now? And how can they make the ""no political bias"" claim with a straight face when it appears that only groups on the Right were ensnared by this? In any case, heads will have to roll over this, right? Wrong:

taxes,American Spectator,2,https://spectator.org/gop-needs-this-tax-cut-more-than-america/,GOP Needs This Tax Cut More Than America,,"Hunt Lawrence, Daniel J. Flynn, Dov Fischer, Debra J. Saunders, David Catron, Paul Kengor","Thou shall speak ill of fellow Republicans… if your name is Donald Trump . And the worshippers at the Church of the Holy GOP regard him as saint rather than a sinner for doing so .
The president mocks “ Liddle Bob Corker ” as “ incompetent. ” His reaction to Senator Jeff Flake ’ s decision to not seek reelection proved more measured if don ’ t-let-the-door-hit-you-on-the-way-out in tone . He said the Arizona Republican enjoyed “ zero chance ” of reelection and “ did the right thing for himself . ”
Little Marco , Lyin ’ Ted , and Low Energy Jeb can all attest the president ’ s skill as a puncher and his will to not serve as someone ’ s punching bag .
Even tax cuts , the closest thing to an Apostles Creed sworn by all Republicans , now creates divisions . Strangely , neither the ambitious reduction of the federal corporate rate from 35 percent to 15 percent nor the proposal to kill the death tax serves , for the Republican caucus , as the provision provoking the most opposition . The elimination of the state and local tax ( SALT ) deduction certainly comes close .
The Senate opted to eliminate the SALT deduction on a 52-47 vote last Thursday . The House likely considers the question this week .
Republican leaders wish to end that deduction as a means of simplifying the code and recouping revenues lost amid the cuts . But GOP congressmen from high-tax states threaten to vote “ no ” unless leadership keeps the deduction . They hope for a compromise .
The Washington Post reports that four Republican congressmen from the Empire and Garden States plan to vote “ no ” if leadership jettisons the SALT deduction . Given the top income tax rate approaching nine percent in both states , one grasps the importance of the issue for representatives from New York and New Jersey .
But one also sees how a deduction that provides relief to taxpayers enables tax-and-spend liberals at the state level by effectively subsidizing them at the expense of federal revenue .
Places that tax more benefit more from the program . Aside from closing a loophole , the elimination of the deduction works , in its own way , to discourage , or at least to not encourage , onerous taxation at the state level .
Enthusiasts for bigger government recognize this . Michael Leachman and Iris J. Lav wrote last week for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities that
the SALT deduction helps state and local governments fund public services that provide widely shared benefits . That ’ s because , with this deduction , higher-income filers are more willing to support state and local taxes . Repealing the deduction would almost certainly make it harder for states and localities — many of which already face serious budget strains — to raise sufficient revenues in the coming years to fund K-12 and higher education , health care , and other services . To balance their budgets with insufficient revenue , state policymakers would likely make cuts in such services that would be widely felt .
But the federal government , now under the weight of more than $ 20 trillion in debt , also struggles to keep expenditures in line with revenues . SALT deductions cost the federal government $ 96 billion this fiscal year . Over the next decade , the deductions reduce revenue by an estimated $ 1.3 trillion .
Senator Charles Schumer , hailing from a tax-happy locale and hoping to empower states to raise taxes , opposes the provision . Some of his arguments possess merit . Corporations , he notes , continue to benefit from the SALT deduction . Why not individuals if corporations ?

Thou shall speak ill of fellow Republicans… if your name is Donald Trump. And the worshippers at the Church of the Holy GOP regard him as saint rather than a sinner for doing so.

The president mocks “Liddle Bob Corker” as “incompetent.” His reaction to Senator Jeff Flake’s decision to not seek reelection proved more measured if don’t-let-the-door-hit-you-on-the-way-out in tone. He said the Arizona Republican enjoyed “zero chance” of reelection and “did the right thing for himself.”

Little Marco, Lyin’ Ted, and Low Energy Jeb can all attest the president’s skill as a puncher and his will to not serve as someone’s punching bag.

Even tax cuts, the closest thing to an Apostles Creed sworn by all Republicans, now creates divisions. Strangely, neither the ambitious reduction of the federal corporate rate from 35 percent to 15 percent nor the proposal to kill the death tax serves, for the Republican caucus, as the provision provoking the most opposition. The elimination of the state and local tax (SALT) deduction certainly comes close.

The Senate opted to eliminate the SALT deduction on a 52-47 vote last Thursday. The House likely considers the question this week.

Republican leaders wish to end that deduction as a means of simplifying the code and recouping revenues lost amid the cuts. But GOP congressmen from high-tax states threaten to vote “no” unless leadership keeps the deduction. They hope for a compromise.

The Washington Post reports that four Republican congressmen from the Empire and Garden States plan to vote “no” if leadership jettisons the SALT deduction. Given the top income tax rate approaching nine percent in both states, one grasps the importance of the issue for representatives from New York and New Jersey.

But one also sees how a deduction that provides relief to taxpayers enables tax-and-spend liberals at the state level by effectively subsidizing them at the expense of federal revenue.

Places that tax more benefit more from the program. Aside from closing a loophole, the elimination of the deduction works, in its own way, to discourage, or at least to not encourage, onerous taxation at the state level.

Enthusiasts for bigger government recognize this. Michael Leachman and Iris J. Lav wrote last week for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities that

the SALT deduction helps state and local governments fund public services that provide widely shared benefits. That’s because, with this deduction, higher-income filers are more willing to support state and local taxes. Repealing the deduction would almost certainly make it harder for states and localities — many of which already face serious budget strains — to raise sufficient revenues in the coming years to fund K-12 and higher education, health care, and other services. To balance their budgets with insufficient revenue, state policymakers would likely make cuts in such services that would be widely felt.

But the federal government, now under the weight of more than $20 trillion in debt, also struggles to keep expenditures in line with revenues. SALT deductions cost the federal government $96 billion this fiscal year. Over the next decade, the deductions reduce revenue by an estimated $1.3 trillion.

Senator Charles Schumer, hailing from a tax-happy locale and hoping to empower states to raise taxes, opposes the provision. Some of his arguments possess merit. Corporations, he notes, continue to benefit from the SALT deduction. Why not individuals if corporations? And something about taxing already-taxed income strikes so many people beyond the Senate minority leader as wrong.

Though tax cutters may gleefully drop a provision that effectively acts as a tax hike, doing so to gain the few Republican votes in the Northeast and California risks losing the deficit hawks everywhere else. Leadership walks a fine line.

Ultimately, Republicans vote not just on the country’s future here, but on their party’s future as well.

With a Fox News survey showing a 50-35 lead for Democrats on a generic ballot that one year ago displayed an even 45-45 split, Republicans need to homer after whiffing on health care. One can’t hang one’s hat on an invisible wall, and brandishing the political scalps of members of the same party comes across, at some point, as an offensive tackle unleashing a sack dance after crushing the quarterback.

The country, experiencing average or below GDP growth (vis-à-vis postwar, 20th-century America) in all but one year this century, really needs this bill. The Republican Party, a divided lot looking (not particularly hard) for unity, really, really needs this bill.

The US Senate, a seemingly insurmountable roadblock for the Republican agenda for much of this year, has at last given its assent to a major piece of legislation.

Perhaps unsurprisingly it was sweeping tax cuts - always beloved by conservatives - that finally brought the party together and gave President Donald Trump the opportunity to claim a landmark legislative achievement.

It wasn't always pretty. Senate negotiators were handwriting amendments to the massive bill practically up until the final votes were taken. Deals within deals were cut to satisfy recalcitrant legislators. Democrats howled at the permanent cuts provided to corporations, while middle-class taxpayer benefits had sunset clauses.

In the end, however, a combination of hope and fear were enough to drag a slim majority into the yes column. The hope is that a booming economy will give Republicans a chance to run on their tax policy when they stand before voters next November. The fear was that yet another failure would have led to a revolt among the party's big donors and traditional business constituencies.

The House and Senate must now smooth out differences in their bills and vote on the compromise. It's not the end of the race, but the finish line is in sight.

What's in the new tax bill?

Presiding over the Senate, Vice-President Mike Pence declared the 51-49 victory to applause from Republicans in the early hours of Saturday morning.

The final draft of the bill went through several changes in order to bring reluctant Republicans on board. Republicans have a 52-48 majority in the Senate.

Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the corporate tax rate would be permanently lowered from 35% to 20%, while future foreign profits of US-based firms would be mainly exempt from tax.

There were some last minute changes, including a $10,000 property tax deduction as requested by Senator Susan Collins, one of the Republicans who had been reluctant to back the bill.

How did senators react?

After the vote, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said his opponents would pay the price at the ballot box in mid-term elections next year.

""My Republican friends will ultimately pay consequences for this bill in 2018 and beyond. The Republican party will never again be the party of tax cuts for middle-class people,"" he warned.

He said the measures would endanger social security and medical provision.

Independent Senator Bernie Sanders was among the most vocal critics, declaring during the debate that the American treasury was ""being looted"".

In the decades since , our country ’ s highest earners have seen their annual pay skyrocket , while the median household ’ s has barely budged . As a result , America ’ s 160,000 richest families now lay claim to 90 percent of its wealth . Studies suggest that this kind of inequality erodes social trust , abets plutocracy , and depresses economic growth . Politicians from both major parties routinely suggest that they see inequality as a major problem .
The case for trickle-down economics — which is to say , the idea that high top-marginal tax rates hurt economic growth — is much weaker now than it was in 1980 . The U.S. saw faster GDP and productivity growth in the decades before Reagan ’ s tax cuts , than it did in the decades after . And during that latter era , the American economy grew at roughly the same rate as peer nations with higher top tax rates . A separate premise of the trickle-down theory held that raising taxes on the rich eventually costs the government revenue by discouraging work . The latest economic research suggests that this is true — but only if you raise the top tax rate higher than ( approximately ) 70 percent .

When Ronald Reagan took office, affluent Americans paid a 70 percent tax rate on all income above $216,000. In the decades since, our country’s highest earners have seen their annual pay skyrocket, while the median household’s has barely budged. As a result, America’s 160,000 richest families now lay claim to 90 percent of its wealth. Studies suggest that this kind of inequality erodes social trust, abets plutocracy, and depresses economic growth. Politicians from both major parties routinely suggest that they see inequality as a major problem.

The case for trickle-down economics — which is to say, the idea that high top-marginal tax rates hurt economic growth — is much weaker now than it was in 1980. The U.S. saw faster GDP and productivity growth in the decades before Reagan’s tax cuts, than it did in the decades after. And during that latter era, the American economy grew at roughly the same rate as peer nations with higher top tax rates. A separate premise of the trickle-down theory held that raising taxes on the rich eventually costs the government revenue by discouraging work. The latest economic research suggests that this is true — but only if you raise the top tax rate higher than (approximately) 70 percent.

Meanwhile, French economist Thomas Piketty has demonstrated that high tax rates reduce pre-tax inequality – ostensibly, by discouraging rent-seeking among top executives, whose compensation is often determined less by productivity than a combination of social mores and their own audacity: CEOs are less likely to extract an extra $5 million from their companies (instead of allowing their firms to invest that sum in other purposes) if they know that Uncle Sam will collect 70 percent of their bonus. Thus, there is now some reason to believe that confiscatory top rates can reduce wage inequality, while producing some gains in economic efficiency.

Specifically, the congresswoman suggested that taxing the rich at such a rate would be preferable to forgoing major investments in renewable energy, and other technologies necessary for averting catastrophic climate change.

And centrist pundits were scandalized by her extremism.

National Journal reporter Josh Kraushaar argued that, while congresswoman Rashida Tlaib’s profane call for Trump’s impeachment was getting more attention, Ocasio-Cortez “calling for a 70 percent tax rate on the nation’s most-watched news show a whole lot more politically damaging for Ds.”

Obamacare’s first tax season includes all the elements needed to ignite a political firestorm. Yet with only days to go until the filing deadline, nothing’s burning.

Americans are reckoning for the first time with the most unpopular part of the law — the individual mandate — and having to prove they’ve had health insurance or to cough up a penalty. As they’ve done their taxes, many people have learned they owe money because they underestimated income when buying subsidized coverage in 2014. Some have had to delay their returns because the government in February sent an inaccurate form on their subsidy total.

There’s been no real uproar, though. Beyond a short-lived flare of criticism after HHS acknowledged those inaccurate subsidy forms, conservatives who might have been expected to keep piling on have stayed relatively silent. Press releases protesting the mandate penalty have been few.

Obamacare’s impact on the tax season hasn’t been mentioned even a single time this year by Washington’s major Sunday morning talk shows or in the weekly Republican address.

“I’ve been surprised how quiet it’s been in the political realm,” said Larry Levitt, senior vice president for special initiatives at the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Oh how far the Democratic party has fallen. In recent days we've seen the new darling of the Democrats Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez crusading for a 70% income tax rate. Now, according to a Washington Times report on Thursday, several prominent Democratic presidential wannabes, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, arguing for tax rates of more than 50%. Julian Castro, an Obama cabinet member who is testing the waters, says approvingly that ""there was a time when the top marginal tax rate was 90%."" It's almost like a race among the presidential aspirants to see who's willing to raise tax rates the most.



What is so disheartening about this cheery talk of returning to confiscatory tax rates is that it was just a little more than 30 years ago that Democrats were carrying the torch for MUCH lower tax rates than we have even today after the Trump tax cuts. Then, Democratic stars Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey and House Majority leader Dick Gephardt sponsored a tax reform bill (with the late great Jack Kemp) to slash tax rates to 28%. They worked with President Ronald Reagan to get the top tax rate down from 50% to 28% by closing gaping tax loopholes. Amazingly the Bradley bill to cut the highest marginal rate to 27% passed in the Senate – are you ready for this? – by a vote 97-3.

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 was a great bipartisan achievement that helped spur many years of strong economic growth.



Where did all the pro-growth Democrats go?



Mr. Castro seems to long for the return to 90% tax rates. Does he know any of the history here? It was President John F. Kennedy who called for a 30% across the board reduction in tax rates that ended the tyranny of a government that could take 90 cents in taxes out of a dollar of earnings. JFK argued correctly that the lower tax rates would ""raise revenues in the long run."" He was right; the lower tax rates spurred a burst of prosperity after he was tragically assassinated.



When Reagan entered office he picked up where JFK left off. During his presidency, the top tax rate fell from 70% down to below 30%. Federal tax receipts even with these lower tax rates doubled from $500 billion in 1980 to just over $1 trillion by 1990 (or roughly 50% higher after accounting for inflation). Former George W.

So much for Reagan ""cutting taxes on the rich.""



Now we skip forward to the Democratic party of 2019 and almost all of the leaders are endorsing tax deform. Ms. Cortez and Warren keep touting a return to the tradition of the Democratic party of higher tax rates to restore fairness for the middle class and promote ""social justice.""

Trump's tax bill cut tax rates, but also eliminated loopholes for the rich.

They hired lawyers and lobbyists to escape paying the taxes, or they stashed their money away in exotic tax-exempt shelters or bought tax-free municipal bonds to avoid forking over the majority of their income to the IRS.



When the top tax rate was 70% in 1980 the richest 1% paid about 20% of all income taxes.

In a New York Times op-ed on Wednesday, Steve Forbes, Larry Kudlow, Arthur Laffer and Stephen Moore — cofounders of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity and advisers to Trump’s campaign — argued that a business-only tax cut bill would be the easiest way for Trump to score a legislative achievement early in his presidency.

They said that Trump shouldn’t tackle comprehensive tax reform in one pass. Instead, Republicans should first work on a bill that makes tax changes for businesses and includes infrastructure funding to make it attractive to Democrats. They then could tackle individual income tax reform in 2018.

“Republicans need to act with some degree of urgency.

Trump and leading congressional Republicans have sought to pass a comprehensive tax bill.

Seager,"Donald J. Trump ’ s threat to sue The New York Times for its report about his leaked 1995 state tax returns showing he lost nearly $ 1 billion is as predictable as it is laughable .
Trump ’ s lawyer pledged “ prompt initiation of appropriate legal action ” against the Times , saying the Oct. 1 story was “ illegal ” because Trump did not authorize the release of his confidential tax returns .
Even my journalism students in my entry-level media law class know that the First Amendment provides an absolute legal shield to journalists who are sued for publishing lawfully obtained documents that are a matter of public concern .
The U.S. Supreme Court ’ s rulings in Pentagon Papers , Florida Star v . B.J.F. , and the tongue-twisting Bartnicki v. Vopper created a First Amendment protection for journalists who publish documents that are confidential by law – so long as the journalist is a passive recipient of the documents . The journalist can not be prosecuted for criminal violations or sued under civil privacy laws even if the leaker broke civil or criminal laws by obtaining or leaking the documents .
The internet is blowing up with stories saying that the Times could be prosecuted criminally under federal tax law 26 U.S. Code Section 7213 ( a ) ( 3 ) , which makes it a felony for “ any person to … willfully print or publish ” tax returns provided “ in a manner unauthorized ” by law . But this is a federal law governing federal tax returns and does not apply to the Times ’ publication of Trump ’ s state tax returns . Even if it did apply , it would probably be unconstitutional as applied to the Times , but we don ’ t need to go there .
Which takes us back to Bartnicki , where the Supreme Court ruled that the government could not punish a radio journalist for airing an illegally taped phone call because the journalist received the tape from a third-party and the tape was a matter of public concern . “ We think it clear that …that a stranger ’ s illegal conduct does not suffice to remove the First Amendment shield from [ a journalist ’ s ] speech about a matter of public concern . ”
There can be no dispute that the tax returns of a current presidential candidate are a matter of public concern , especially when that candidate is campaigning as a successful businessman , has several active businesses and business ties that may influence his decisions as president , and pledges to drastically change the tax code . The Times says it was a passive recipient of the documents , which were mailed anonymously . Trump , therefore , could not win a lawsuit against the Times based on a claim for violation of secrecy laws governing tax returns or invasion of privacy .
But , hey , the First Amendment never got in the way of Trump threatening or filing frivolous lawsuits to chill speech .
My study of the six speech-related cases filed by Trump & Co. found that all five filed in public courts were dismissed before trial . Trump ’ s only victory came in a private arbitration decided by a rent-a-judge who declared Trump the winner because the defendant was a no-show .
Here ’ s a walk down Trump ’ s Libel Walk of Shame , from LOL to ha ha .
My favorite is when Trump sued Bill Maher , host of HBO political talk show Real Time in 2013 . Trump was in full birther mode at the time , trafficking his racist claim that our first black president , Barack Obama , was born in Kenya and demanding to see his birth certificate .
Maher launched his own birther attack : Maher would donate $ 5 million to charity if Trump would provide his birth certificate to disprove he was the “ spawn of his mother having sex with an orangutan . ”
Trump provided his birth certificate and filed a $ 5 million breach of contract lawsuit against Maher , only to quickly withdraw it , robbing Maher of the pleasure of slapping down one of LA ’ s silliest cases , even by crybaby Hollywood-celebrity standards .
Just two months ago , a federal judge in Las Vegas bounced the deceptive advertising lawsuit filed in 2015 by Trump ’ s Las Vegas hotel companies against two labor unions for calling Trump anti-union . As the judge ruled on Aug. 8 , labor protests are hardly advertising .
Trump ’ s greediest lawsuit was his $ 5-billion libel lawsuit filed in 2006 against Timothy O ’ Brien for saying in his book TrumpNation , The Art of Being The Donald , that Trump was at best worth $ 250 million , not the billions Trump claimed .
A Jersey court dismissed the case because Trump failed to prove O ’ Brien had “ any actual doubts ” about the accuracy of his book and Trump lacked any “ reliable ” evidence that he was worth billions , admitting his net worth is “ based on [ his ] … own feelings . ”
Trump University – Trump ’ s for-profit real estate “ school ” – lost its $ 1-million libel lawsuit in 2014 against a former Trump U student . Trump U sued Tarla Makaeff in California for saying Trump U and its affiliates engaged in “ deceptive business practices , ” “ trickery , ” and “ fraud. ” It took four years , but the libel claim was dismissed by a federal judge who ruled that Trump U failed to prove that the former student published with knowing falsity .
Trump fell in love with libel litigation when he filed his first libel lawsuit in 1984 against the Chicago Tribune and its architecture critic for calling Trump ’ s 1980 ’ s plan to erect a 150-story Manhattan skyscraper “ aesthetically lousy. ” The lawsuit was dismissed by a federal judge in New York who said there is no accounting for taste and Trump should get a thicker skin .
Trump has one “ victory : ” Trump ’ s Miss Universe/Miss USA pageant company sued and won a $ 5-million default libel judgment in 2013 against Miss USA contestant in Sheena Monnin for calling the Miss USA pageant “ rigged. ” ( Was she sued for using Trump ’ s favorite word ? ) But Monnin got bad advice from her attorney to skip the private arbitration , which was decided by a rent-a-judge who gave Trump a victory based on Monnin ’ s default . Winning by default is not a true win . It ’ s just good luck .

But the debt ceiling holds equal , if not greater , importance for the economy and the political fortunes of both parties . Rating agencies are threatening another downgrade of U.S. debt if Congress strains to increase the borrowing limit like it did last year .
The politics of this fight are simple : Democrats are roundly peeved with how Congress and the White House handled the debt ceiling in 2011 and say they won ’ t fight on it again . Democrats on Capitol Hill thought the administration gave up too much for a vote that was once a legislative technicality .
Republicans know it ’ s a difficult vote for nearly all of their members . They need something to show for it — and to uphold Boehner ’ s principle that the nation should only acquire more debt if it ’ s willing to cut an equal amount of spending or save a commensurate amount of money through entitlement reform .
This time , Obama is saying he won ’ t indulge the speaker .
Boehner shouldn ’ t expect a thing in return for raising the debt ceiling , and certainly not his demand for spending cuts that exceed the jump in the borrowing limit , Democratic officials said .
“ Do you really think we would come up with a $ 4 trillion grand bargain and then try to find another $ 1 trillion in cuts to offset a debt ceiling increase ? I don ’ t think so , ” said a Senate Democratic aide .
Congressional Democrats are pushing Obama to hold firm . They ’ ve even privately suggested Obama consider raising the debt ceiling without Congress . Their argument is that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution says the “ validity of the public debt … shall not be questioned , ” which means the president can raise the cap on his own .
In fact , at the tail end of a news conference on Nov. 15 , House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( D-Calif. ) said as much publicly , although the offhanded remark largely flew under the radar .
“ Well , I am with the 11th Amendment , so , is it the 11th Amendment that — 14th ? ” Pelosi said . “ Whatever it is , I am with the Constitution of the United States . ”
Nothing raises the ire of Republicans in Congress like the specter of Obama taking matters into his own hands . If the White House goes that route and raises the debt ceiling by executive order , Boehner and his leadership team would likely take immediate legal action to halt the debt ceiling increase , sources familiar with his thinking said .","President Obama was told by John Boehner that the debt limit is his leverage. | AP Photos The other fiscal fight

President Barack Obama made a demand of House Speaker John Boehner near the end of their first White House meeting on the fiscal cliff: Raise the debt limit before year’s end.

Boehner responded: “There is a price for everything.”

Story Continued Below

And with that exchange, described by sources familiar with the Nov. 16 session, an issue that has been overshadowed by the fiscal cliff showdown moved to the forefront of already complicated negotiations to avert more than $500 billion in spending cuts and tax increases by the new year. With bitter memories of the 2011 debt-limit standoff still fresh, both sides are engaged in another aggressive round of hardball.

( PHOTOS: Fiscal cliff's key players)

Within a few months, Congress will once again need to increase the nation’s borrowing capability. Obama and congressional Democrats, still stung by the last bruising fight, want to hike the debt ceiling without drama. But Boehner wants to use the debt limit to extract more concessions from Democrats. He told Obama at the White House that it’s “my leverage,” although he added that he’s flexible on when it should be done.

Most of the attention so far has focused on income tax increases and the entitlement program changes that could affect every American. But the debt ceiling holds equal, if not greater, importance for the economy and the political fortunes of both parties. Rating agencies are threatening another downgrade of U.S. debt if Congress strains to increase the borrowing limit like it did last year.

The politics of this fight are simple: Democrats are roundly peeved with how Congress and the White House handled the debt ceiling in 2011 and say they won’t fight on it again. Democrats on Capitol Hill thought the administration gave up too much for a vote that was once a legislative technicality.

Republicans know it’s a difficult vote for nearly all of their members. They need something to show for it — and to uphold Boehner’s principle that the nation should only acquire more debt if it’s willing to cut an equal amount of spending or save a commensurate amount of money through entitlement reform.

This time, Obama is saying he won’t indulge the speaker.

Boehner shouldn’t expect a thing in return for raising the debt ceiling, and certainly not his demand for spending cuts that exceed the jump in the borrowing limit, Democratic officials said.

“Do you really think we would come up with a $4 trillion grand bargain and then try to find another $1 trillion in cuts to offset a debt ceiling increase? I don’t think so,” said a Senate Democratic aide.

( Also on POLITICO: Complete coverage of the fiscal cliff)

Congressional Democrats are pushing Obama to hold firm. They’ve even privately suggested Obama consider raising the debt ceiling without Congress. Their argument is that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution says the “validity of the public debt … shall not be questioned,” which means the president can raise the cap on his own.

In fact, at the tail end of a news conference on Nov. 15, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said as much publicly, although the offhanded remark largely flew under the radar.

“Well, I am with the 11th Amendment, so, is it the 11th Amendment that — 14th?” Pelosi said. “Whatever it is, I am with the Constitution of the United States.”

Nothing raises the ire of Republicans in Congress like the specter of Obama taking matters into his own hands. If the White House goes that route and raises the debt ceiling by executive order, Boehner and his leadership team would likely take immediate legal action to halt the debt ceiling increase, sources familiar with his thinking said.",www.politico.com,left,nHe94UaNiDi33N1r

That was the gist of a letter sent Tuesday from Acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller to top tax writers in Congress as lawmakers are poised to start negotiations about the fiscal cliff .

That was the gist of a letter sent Tuesday from Acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller to top tax writers in Congress as lawmakers are poised to start negotiations about the fiscal cliff.

Just how much of a mess?

The IRS would need to tell more than 60 million taxpayers that they may not file their 2012 tax returns or receive a refund until the IRS makes changes to its systems. That may mean taxpayers couldn't file until late March, Miller said.

Income exemption levels under the ""wealth tax"" -- as the AMT is known -- were never adjusted for inflation since it was enacted decades ago. So Congress has regularly passed an AMT ""patch"" to correct for that by raising the exemption levels.

Only problem is they have failed to do so for this tax year.

As a result, roughly 28 million taxpayers will face much bigger than expected tax bills or much smaller refunds when they file their 2012 returns next year.

Trumbell makes two basic arguments here. Let's examine each:





(1) Revenues may reach a numerical high this year, but they'll still be lower than the historical average, as a percentage of the economy. This is true; although, as he notes, we'll likely hit that multi-decade equilibrium next year. But as Philip Klein reported last month, the CBO projects revenues to zoom past the historical average over the next decade, yet deficits will continue to explode the national debt.

Klein added this perspective:



Despite the fact that new tax revenue will be drastically outpacing growth in the defense budget, the nation is still projected to accumulate an additional $7 trillion in deficits over the next 10-year period, bringing the public debt to $20 trillion. The cause of that debt, therefore, cannot be taxes that are too low or defense spending that's too high. In fact, by 2020, Congress could vote to eliminate all military spending and it wouldn't even be enough to cover interest payments on the national debt.



(2) Even though the rudimentary arithmetic confirms that overspending -- not undertaxing -- is fueling our debt crisis, public polling indicates that the public isn't willing to identify popular, expensive programs as the problem. On one hand, the American people do recognize the government's spending problem and are demanding spending restraint. On the other, Trumbell is right: Most people have little appetite for even modest reforms to the entitlement programs whose unfunded liabilities threaten to swamp the solvency of the country. But a poll that says a lot of people don't want to call Medicare's unpaid-for promises a problem does not negate the fact that they are.

`` One of the those specifically is an act that our office is leading , called the Universal Charitable Giving Act , that allows families and people that are n't itemizing to deduct . Whether it 's their local church , local shelters , local communities – we hope that 's included in the next review , '' he said .
Walker says although most people give out of the goodness of their heart , this bill makes sure the new tax plan wo n't negatively affect donations to churches and non-profits .

`` We believe and hear that it is picking up some energy . At some point , we would like to attach it to something this year , '' he explained . `` It did not make tax reform – you are correct – but it is still something at the forefront of many of us who have a conservative worldview and also believers .

""One of the those specifically is an act that our office is leading, called the Universal Charitable Giving Act, that allows families and people that aren't itemizing to deduct. Whether it's their local church, local shelters, local communities – we hope that's included in the next review,"" he said.

Walker says although most people give out of the goodness of their heart, this bill makes sure the new tax plan won't negatively affect donations to churches and non-profits.

""We want to make sure that those gifts are protected,"" the North Carolina lawmaker explained.

But Walker says he does not expect another attempt at repealing the Johnson Amendment through tax reform.

""We believe and hear that it is picking up some energy. At some point, we would like to attach it to something this year,"" he explained. ""It did not make tax reform – you are correct – but it is still something at the forefront of many of us who have a conservative worldview and also believers.""

Lawmakers believe they could begin voting on parts of phase two as early as this month.",www1.cbn.com,right,mtqmWMr5pkcDcQrL

The Debt Is No Reason Not to Pass Tax Reform

If you 're a Democrat , you can add death taxes to that list .
The death tax , which was being phased out by President Bush from 2001-2008 but revived by the Obama administration in 2009 , currently sits at 40 percent . More background from Heritage :
Estate tax ( death tax ) repeal . The Bush tax cuts phased out the death tax . It was supposed to be completely eliminated after 2009 . However , after being dormant for one year in 2009 , the 2010 deal between President Obama and Congress brought it back to life at 35 percent with a $ 5 million exemption . The fiscal cliff deal kept the exemption at $ 5 million ( indexed for inflation ) and increased the rate from 35 percent to 40 percent .
Now , Congress is acting to eliminate the death tax altogether . Yesterday the House passed legislation
The House has passed a bill that would repeal the federal tax on estates .
Republicans call it the `` death tax . '' They say it prevents small business owners from passing businesses on to their heirs . Democrats say repealing the tax is a giveaway to the rich .
Republican Senator John Thune and Congressman Bill Flores explained the legislation earlier this week in an op-ed for USA Today :
Thankfully , the federal policy that combines the two by taxing estates when a loved one passes away is close to extinction . Enacted nearly 100 years ago , the death tax places a significant burden on families that want to achieve the American dream — securing a better future for their children — by passing down a small business or a family farm from one generation to the next . The policy is also widely unpopular , with nearly 70 % of Americans saying they want to see it repealed permanently .
Repealing the death tax restores fairness for American families , and is a step toward a 21st century , pro-growth tax code . Now , with support growing in both the House and Senate , Congress has the opportunity to do just that .
Proponents of the death tax often argue that it only impacts the wealthiest Americans , but this is simply not true . In practice , the death tax hits hardest those families that run small businesses or operate farms , with devastating results . A 2012 report from the Republican staff of the Joint Economic Committee ( JEC ) called the death tax `` an overwhelming cause of the dissolution of family businesses '' and `` a significant hindrance to entrepreneurial activity . '' This is because families that have spent a lifetime working hard — and paying taxes — to build a successful business may lack the liquid assets to meet the federal government 's steep death tax rate . The only way to satisfy the Internal Revenue Service is to break up the business or parcel off the family farm to pay the tax liability . The federal government should not be punishing families for their hard work . Instead , we should promote strong family businesses that contribute to our vibrant economy and withstand the test of time .
Ironically , by discouraging investment , the death tax hurts the U.S. economy and , according to some studies , actually decreases long-term tax revenue .
The White House is slamming the legislation and claiming it gives a break to the `` wealthiest Americans , '' when in reality it gives a break to any American receiving an inheritance over a certain threshold , in particular farms and businesses , that have already been taxed multiple times . President Obama has threatened a veto .","They say there are two things that are certain in life: death and taxes. If you're a Democrat, you can add death taxes to that list.

The fiscal cliff deal kept the exemption at $5 million (indexed for inflation) and increased the rate from 35 percent to 40 percent.



Now, Congress is acting to eliminate the death tax altogether. Yesterday the House passed legislation

to do so.

The House has passed a bill that would repeal the federal tax on estates.



Republicans call it the ""death tax."" They say it prevents small business owners from passing businesses on to their heirs. Democrats say repealing the tax is a giveaway to the rich.



The vote was 240-179.





Republican Senator John Thune and Congressman Bill Flores explained the legislation earlier this week in an op-ed for USA Today:

Thankfully, the federal policy that combines the two by taxing estates when a loved one passes away is close to extinction. Enacted nearly 100 years ago, the death tax places a significant burden on families that want to achieve the American dream — securing a better future for their children — by passing down a small business or a family farm from one generation to the next. The policy is also widely unpopular, with nearly 70% of Americans saying they want to see it repealed permanently.



Repealing the death tax restores fairness for American families, and is a step toward a 21st century, pro-growth tax code. Now, with support growing in both the House and Senate, Congress has the opportunity to do just that.



Proponents of the death tax often argue that it only impacts the wealthiest Americans, but this is simply not true. In practice, the death tax hits hardest those families that run small businesses or operate farms, with devastating results. A 2012 report from the Republican staff of the Joint Economic Committee (JEC) called the death tax ""an overwhelming cause of the dissolution of family businesses"" and ""a significant hindrance to entrepreneurial activity."" This is because families that have spent a lifetime working hard — and paying taxes — to build a successful business may lack the liquid assets to meet the federal government's steep death tax rate. The only way to satisfy the Internal Revenue Service is to break up the business or parcel off the family farm to pay the tax liability. The federal government should not be punishing families for their hard work. Instead, we should promote strong family businesses that contribute to our vibrant economy and withstand the test of time.



Ironically, by discouraging investment, the death tax hurts the U.S. economy and, according to some studies, actually decreases long-term tax revenue.



The White House is slamming the legislation and claiming it gives a break to the ""wealthiest Americans,"" when in reality it gives a break to any American receiving an inheritance over a certain threshold, in particular farms and businesses, that have already been taxed multiple times.

According to reports from the Wall Street Journal , it ’ s basically the same as what he ’ s been touting all along : trillions of dollars in tax cuts for corporations and owner-operated businesses ( “ pass-throughs ” ) , plus a small tax break for child care expenses .
And we still don ’ t know how he plans to pay for it all , because he ’ s not including the border adjustment tax proposed by House Republicans , which would have offset some of the lost revenue by about $ 1 trillion over 10 years .
The only provision so far that will raise some money is a one-time 10 percent tax on foreign profits that US multinational corporations have stashed overseas . Right now , American companies have $ 2.6 trillion in untaxed income earned abroad — a move many use to avoid paying the 35 corporate tax rate . Trump ’ s “ repatriation holiday ” is supposed to encourage them to bring that money back at a lower tax rate , though there is no telling how many companies would do so .
The Washington Post has also reported that the White House wants to increase the standard deduction for working families , though it ’ s unclear by how much .
Trump ’ s primary goal appears to be lowering the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent , according to the Wall Street Journal . It ’ s a drastic cut , and lower than the 20 percent rate proposed by House Republicans . The 15 percent rate alone could cost $ 2.4 trillion over 10 years , according to budget estimates .
Lowering the corporate tax rate is a popular idea , particularly because the United States has one of the highest in the world . This has encouraged multinational corporations to shift billions of profits to lower-tax countries as a way to decrease their tax bill .
Leonard Burman of the Tax Policy Center worries that a 15 percent rate could also create a loophole for wealthy taxpayers :
Combining a corporate tax rate of 15 percent with a top individual rate of 37 percent ( another likely Trump proposal ) would create a powerful incentive for wealthy people to squirrel away a large portion of their assets in a corporation . They ’ d pay 15 percent tax on profits versus 20 percent on capital gains and dividends or 37 percent on interest , rents , or royalties . If they hold their corporation until they die , they could transfer their assets tax-free to heirs , who could continue to accumulate lightly-taxed profits by simply keeping the assets in the corporation .
One of the more questionable proposals yet is Trump ’ s decision to stick to his plan to lower the tax rate for owner-operated businesses , known as pass-throughs , from 39.6 to 15 percent . The vast majority of pass-through businesses are already taxed at a 15 percent rate , so lowering the top rate would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest of them , mostly hedge fund managers , lawyers , and doctors , according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities . It would also be a major benefit for Trump , as most of his businesses are pass-throughs .
Another concern about such a major cut on pass-through taxes is that it will encourage individuals to report their wages as business income as a way to avoid paying up to 33 percent in individual taxes ( 33 percent is the top individual tax rate proposed by House Republicans ) . That would create a huge loophole , and the Tax Policy Center believes such tax avoidance would cost $ 650 billion .
It would be hard to prevent such gaming . Congress and the IRS already struggle to design and enforce rules preventing high earners from reclassifying their wages as “ business income ” to avoid payroll taxes , and this tax break would create an even greater incentive to use such schemes .
Trump is planning to include child care tax breaks as part of his plan . From the Wall Street Journal :
Mr. Trump also plans to include a tax break for child-care expenses , similar to the one he proposed during the campaign at the urging of his daughter , Ivanka , now one of his top advisers in the White House .
During the campaign , Trump proposed using tax credits , a tax deduction , and child care savings accounts to help cover the cost of child care for some Americans . Then , as now , the idea was attributed to his daughter Ivanka .
Under that plan , lower-income families — either single parents making $ 31,200 a year or less , or two working parents making $ 62,400 or less — would qualify for a refundable tax credit to cover child care expenses . ( A “ refundable ” tax credit means that if the credit ends up being more than the taxes you owe , the government pays you the difference . )
Taxpayers could also deduct the cost of child care from their income . Single parents making $ 250,000 or less , or couples making $ 500,000 or less , would qualify .
Both tax benefits would be capped at a certain rate , based on the average cost of child care in the state where the family lives .
Trump ’ s campaign plan also allowed people to contribute up to $ 2,000 , per child per year , tax-free into a dependent care savings account . They could then use that money to pay for child care .
The bottom line of all these policies , though , is that they would largely benefit Americans with higher incomes . From the Tax Policy Center :
Our analysis finds that about 70 percent of benefits go to families with at least $ 100,000 and 25 percent of benefits go to families with at least $ 200,000 . Very few benefits go to the lowest income families who are likely to struggle most with paying for child care .
The most hotly debated tax proposal over the past few months was what ’ s called a border adjustment tax .
The tax is complicated , but the gist is this : Companies would not be taxed on goods they export out of the United States , but would be taxed on goods they import into the US . It would fundamentally change how American businesses are taxed , prioritizing domestic production .
This was a key part of the House Republican plan — and it was essential to raising revenue so the plan would pay for itself and comply with the complex Senate rules that allow Republicans to pass a bill with a bare majority in the upper chamber .
But it looks like Trump is going to kill the concept . Per the New York Times , “ The Trump administration has dropped any support for a so-called border adjustment tax on imports , according to two people who have been briefed on the matter . ”
This is important for two reasons . First , politically this decision puts the White House fundamentally at odds with House leaders on a crucial piece of the latter ’ s plan .
Second , it removes another tool from Trump ’ s toolbox if he is serious about making the hard choices necessary to ensure his plan is deficit-neutral . The Tax Foundation had estimated that the tax would raise $ 1.1 trillion over 10 years .
Though , as we documented earlier , Trump may instead be positioning himself to use unrealistic economic projections , showing the tax cuts fully paying for themselves , to get around that issue .","As President Trump prepares to unveil his “massive” tax cuts on Wednesday, an outline of his plan is starting to emerge.

taxes,CNN (Web News),0,http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/11/26/cnn-poll-two-thirds-say-fiscal-cliff-poses-major-problem/?hpt=po_c1,CNN Poll: Two-thirds say fiscal cliff poses major problem ,2012-11-26,,"Washington ( CNN ) - A new national poll suggests Americans understand that the `` fiscal cliff '' is no joking matter .
Two-thirds of people questioned in a CNN/ORC International survey ( PDF ) say that the U.S. would face a crisis or major problems if the country went off the `` fiscal cliff '' at the end of the year , and if that happened , Republicans in Congress would probably receive the greater share of the blame .
The poll also indicates that more than seven in ten Americans call for compromise on this issue , but they are pessimistic about that actually happening , with two-thirds predicting that Washington officials will act like `` spoiled children , '' not `` responsible adults , '' in the upcoming negotiations .
Last year Congress and President Barack Obama agreed to a program to reduce the federal deficit that some people refer to as the `` fiscal cliff . '' Unless Congress and the President reach an agreement within the next few weeks , tax rates will automatically rise next year for nearly all Americans and major spending cuts will automatically begin to kick in for most government spending programs , including military programs .
According to the poll , which was released Monday , nearly one out of four say those tax increases and spending cuts will cause a crisis , with another 44 % saying they would cause major problems . Nearly one in four say if the country falls off the `` fiscal cliff , '' only minor problems would occur , with 7 % saying there would be no consequences .
`` Americans definitely feel that they have something at stake in the upcoming negotiations - 77 % believe that their personal financial situation will be affected if the government goes off the fiscal cliff , '' said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland .
At issue in the negotiations is a disagreement between the two major political parties over how to best raise the federal government 's revenues . The president and most congressional Democrats argue for tax rate increases on the wealthiest Americans in order to raise revenue , while most congressional Republicans call for the closing of loopholes and reform in the tax code . Both parties have indicated a willingness to implement spending cuts , although a decision over how much and where has yet to be made .
Two thirds of those questioned in the poll say that any agreement should include a mix of spending cuts and tax increases , with just under one in three saying a deal should only include spending cuts .
Democrats questioned in the survey overwhelmingly support an agreement that has both , and six out of ten independents feel the same way . By a 52 % -44 % margin , Republicans also favor a mixture of spending cuts and tax increases instead of a deal that only includes spending cuts .
As for the sticking point between the parties over an increase in taxes for the wealthiest Americans , 56 % say taxes on wealthy people should be kept high so the government can use their money for programs to help lower-income people , with 36 % saying taxes on such high earners should be kept low because they invest their money in the private sector and that helps the economy and creates jobs .
As for the prospects of a deal to avoid the `` fiscal cliff , '' the public 's not so optimistic .
`` Americans are n't sanguine about the prospects of a deal . Only 28 % say that Washington officials will act like responsible adults in this matter , with 67 % saying they believe they will behave like spoiled children , '' adds Holland .
The poll also indicates that the GOP is not exactly bargaining from a position of strength . Fifty-three percent of the country has an unfavorable view of the Republican Party ; only 42 % want to see congressional Republican have more influence than the president over the direction the nation takes in the next two years . And seven in ten say the GOP has not done enough to cooperate with Obama .
All of that helps explain why more Americans would blame the Republicans in Congress ( 45 % ) rather than Obama ( 34 % ) if the fiscal cliff provisions actually go into effect next year . Obama comes in for his share of criticism - nearly half say he is not doing enough to cooperate with the Republicans , although seven in ten want him to compromise with the GOP even if he has to sacrifice some of his beliefs .
The CNN poll was conducted by ORC International from November 16-18 , with 1,023 adult Americans questioned by telephone . The survey 's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points .","7 years ago

Washington (CNN) - A new national poll suggests Americans understand that the ""fiscal cliff"" is no joking matter.

Two-thirds of people questioned in a CNN/ORC International survey (PDF) say that the U.S. would face a crisis or major problems if the country went off the ""fiscal cliff"" at the end of the year, and if that happened, Republicans in Congress would probably receive the greater share of the blame.



The poll also indicates that more than seven in ten Americans call for compromise on this issue, but they are pessimistic about that actually happening, with two-thirds predicting that Washington officials will act like ""spoiled children,"" not ""responsible adults,"" in the upcoming negotiations.

Last year Congress and President Barack Obama agreed to a program to reduce the federal deficit that some people refer to as the ""fiscal cliff."" Unless Congress and the President reach an agreement within the next few weeks, tax rates will automatically rise next year for nearly all Americans and major spending cuts will automatically begin to kick in for most government spending programs, including military programs.

According to the poll, which was released Monday, nearly one out of four say those tax increases and spending cuts will cause a crisis, with another 44% saying they would cause major problems. Nearly one in four say if the country falls off the ""fiscal cliff,"" only minor problems would occur, with 7% saying there would be no consequences.

""Americans definitely feel that they have something at stake in the upcoming negotiations - 77% believe that their personal financial situation will be affected if the government goes off the fiscal cliff,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland.

At issue in the negotiations is a disagreement between the two major political parties over how to best raise the federal government's revenues. The president and most congressional Democrats argue for tax rate increases on the wealthiest Americans in order to raise revenue, while most congressional Republicans call for the closing of loopholes and reform in the tax code. Both parties have indicated a willingness to implement spending cuts, although a decision over how much and where has yet to be made.

So what does the public think?

Two thirds of those questioned in the poll say that any agreement should include a mix of spending cuts and tax increases, with just under one in three saying a deal should only include spending cuts.

Democrats questioned in the survey overwhelmingly support an agreement that has both, and six out of ten independents feel the same way. By a 52%-44% margin, Republicans also favor a mixture of spending cuts and tax increases instead of a deal that only includes spending cuts.

As for the sticking point between the parties over an increase in taxes for the wealthiest Americans, 56% say taxes on wealthy people should be kept high so the government can use their money for programs to help lower-income people, with 36% saying taxes on such high earners should be kept low because they invest their money in the private sector and that helps the economy and creates jobs.

As for the prospects of a deal to avoid the ""fiscal cliff,"" the public's not so optimistic.

""Americans aren't sanguine about the prospects of a deal. Only 28% say that Washington officials will act like responsible adults in this matter, with 67% saying they believe they will behave like spoiled children,"" adds Holland.

The poll also indicates that the GOP is not exactly bargaining from a position of strength. Fifty-three percent of the country has an unfavorable view of the Republican Party; only 42% want to see congressional Republican have more influence than the president over the direction the nation takes in the next two years. And seven in ten say the GOP has not done enough to cooperate with Obama.

All of that helps explain why more Americans would blame the Republicans in Congress (45%) rather than Obama (34%) if the fiscal cliff provisions actually go into effect next year. Obama comes in for his share of criticism - nearly half say he is not doing enough to cooperate with the Republicans, although seven in ten want him to compromise with the GOP even if he has to sacrifice some of his beliefs.

The CNN poll was conducted by ORC International from November 16-18, with 1,023 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.

They’re slated to meet the press at the same time Trump has a scheduled meeting with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.

Presidential leadership is seen as crucial to tax reform’s success. Congress last passed tax reform legislation in 1986, when it was a top priority of President Reagan.

Here are five things to watch for on Wednesday.

How much does Trump’s proposal resemble his campaign tax plan?

Trump repeatedly talked about cutting taxes during his campaign, and Wednesday’s plan is expected to include his past proposal to cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent.

The Wall Street Journal also reported Tuesday that Trump will call for cutting the top rate on “pass-through” business income to 15 percent, an idea that is in line with his campaign proposals. Pass-through businesses, which include many small businesses, have their income taxed through the individual tax code.

Yet meetings between Trump’s economic team and lawmakers, businesses and industry groups suggest a potential openness to new ideas, too.

The extent to which Trump’s new tax proposals resemble his campaign plan is important because it could signal how in line the White House’s goals are with those of House Republicans.

Over the course of his campaign, Trump’s tax plan was revised to look more like the House GOP blueprint. Specifically, it adopted the blueprint’s individual tax brackets of 12 percent, 25 percent and 33 percent.

But the White House may not be married to those rates for individuals. The Journal reported that Mnuchin may want a top individual tax rate of 37 percent. The top rate under current law is 39.6 percent.

Is the proposal actually tax reform?

It’s unclear whether the White House will overhaul the tax code or limit itself to tax cuts.

Reform means reducing some taxes while eliminating other breaks to pay for the reductions and to simplify the code.

Tax cuts could be easier, because this wouldn’t involve picking winners and losers and angering lobbyists.

But tax cuts that add to the deficit could be more difficult to pass under congressional rules than revenue-neutral tax reform.

If congressional Republicans want to pass a tax bill under budget reconciliation in order to avoid a filibuster, the bill cannot increase the deficit outside of the 10-year budget window. That means tax cuts that lower revenue would need Democratic support or would need to expire.

Cohn said at an event Thursday that the administration “would like to have permanence to tax.”

But Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said on “Fox News Sunday” that the administration hasn’t decided yet whether it wants tax reform to be revenue neutral and that “you can either have a small tax cut that’s permanent or a large tax cut that is short term.”

What does Trump say about an import tax?

The House Republicans’ border-adjustment provision to tax imports and exempt exports has not been well-received in the Senate, so Trump’s stance on the proposal could be a significant factor in its success.

House GOP leaders argue that the proposal is important because it raises revenue that helps pay for lowering tax rates and it helps to end incentives for companies to move jobs overseas. But retailers and some lawmakers have expressed concerns that the higher taxes on imports could translate to higher prices on everyday goods.

The White House has so far given mixed signals on the proposal. Trump said earlier this month that he doesn’t like the term border adjustment but expressed some interest in a “reciprocal tax” on imports.

Media reports have indicated that it’s unlikely that border adjustability will be part of Trump’s forthcoming plan.

“My sense is they’re going to be silent” and tout the virtue of their plan rather than pick on parts of others’ plans, said Brandon Arnold, executive vice president of the National Taxpayers Union.

Does the plan take aim at any tax preferences?

Mulvaney said that Wednesday’s announcement will involve “specific governing principles” and some ideas the administration likes and doesn’t like. His comments suggest that Trump’s announcement won’t get into the nitty-gritty of the tax code.

But the administration has signaled in the past that it plans to limit or eliminate some tax breaks to help pay for lowering rates. Any detail will be sure to catch people’s attention.

Trump’s campaign tax plan proposed capping itemized deductions for high earners, and the White House has been considering curbing the deduction for charitable contributions.

How much does Trump’s proposal change the debate?

The tax reform discussion in Washington has so far largely focused on the House Republicans’ blueprint, and GOP leaders have said they want to pass legislation through reconciliation so that it doesn’t need Democratic support.

The release of a White House plan could shift the center of gravity away from the House plan. And there are some lawmakers that hope that the White House’s plan provides an opening for Republicans to work with Democrats.

“You’re going to have to do business with Democrats to try to get a tax overhaul through,” Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) told The Hill on Monday. He noted that the 1986 tax reform bill was a bipartisan measure.

There was speculation Tuesday that the plan would likely include infrastructure spending and a tax break for childcare in an effort to entice Democrats, though reports later in the day seemed to cast doubt that the $1 trillion infrastructure plan would make it in.

But Democratic lawmakers won’t want to back a White House tax plan if they view it as largely benefiting wealthy people and large corporations. They also want Trump to release his tax returns before legislation is considered.

taxes,Guest Writer - Right,2,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/10/for-democrats-taxes-arent-about-revenue/,"For Democrats, Taxes Aren’t about Revenue",2019-10-01,"Kevin D. Williamson, Jim Geraghty, Kyle Smith, Luke Thompson, Zachary Evans, David French, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Tobias Hoonhout, Victor Davis Hanson","President Barack Obama delivers his State of the Union speech , January 28 , 2014 . ( Larry Downing/Reuters )
When politicians fail at the basics of governance , they embrace moral crusades and moral hysterias .
Perhaps the strangest utterance of Barack Obama ’ s career in public office — a career that was full of utterly bizarre pronunciations of many kinds on many subjects — was his 2008 claim that raising taxes on the wealthy is a moral imperative , even if the tax increase in question ended up reducing overall federal revenue .
Which is to say , Obama argued that it did not matter whether a tax increase hurt the Treasury , so long as it also hurt , at least in theory and on paper , certain wealthy people . That wasn ’ t a one-off : In his crackpot speech in Osawatomie , Kan. , during which he tried to reanimate Teddy Roosevelt ’ s “ new nationalism ” cult ( this was back before progressives had decided that to use the word “ nationalism ” in public was akin to shouting “ Sieg heil ! ” ) , he took a similarly moralizing approach . “ Our tax code must reflect our values , ” he proclaimed .
Here is a brief outline of how government under a liberal-democratic regime such as our own is supposed to work : People by nature have certain rights , and these do not come from the state ; the American proposition is that we are endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights . Government does not give us these rights ( life , liberty , and property prominent among them ) but rather is an instrument we create to secure those rights . We do not give up our right to liberty or to property to the state — we can ’ t ; that ’ s what “ unalienable ” means — but we can delegate some of our power to the state to protect them . Complementing that , we pool some of our resources to procure certain “ public goods ” such as courts of law and border guards , certain kinds of infrastructure , and the preservation of nature . None of that is free , and so we agree to pay certain taxes in order to secure both our own individual rights and certain shared interests .
Every system of taxation creates serious problems . Cities and school districts tax our houses and other real estate , which means that you never own your own home but are forever obliged in effect to rent it from the government ; the federal government and most states tax our income , which means that you do not own the fruits of your own labor but rather are permitted to receive a portion of them at the sufferance of the state ; etc . Intellectual careers have been dedicated to attempting to perfect taxation ; 19th-century economist Henry George built a following that endures to this idea with his proposal to derive all government revenue from a single tax on the value of unimproved land . There are lots of big ideas — VAT , the so-called Fair Tax , the progressive income tax — but all of them create perverse incentives and unintentional consequences .
There are two ways around that . There is the American libertarian model , which more or less concedes that all tax regimes are destructive and at least partly immoral ( say it with me : “ Taxation is theft ! ” ) and advocates limited government funded by low taxes . That ’ s the “ necessary evil , but still evil ” school of taxation . The leading intellectual competitor to that in the liberal-democratic world is the Scandinavian model , which combines relatively high taxes with generous social services administered by competent , honest , and transparent government , characterized by consensus-driven democratic politics with broad and deep popular buy-in . This is taxation not as transfer but as social insurance , with the state acting to even out the economic ups and downs of people ’ s lives — you pay high taxes when you ’ re younger and when you ’ re making more money to offset the difficulties of being old or sick .
American progressives tend to admire the Scandinavian model , and not without good reason : Countries such as Denmark and Sweden have their troubles , but they are generally quite happy , healthy , well-governed , and economically vibrant . Conservative critics point out that there is more to the story : These are relatively small ( Iceland ’ s population is about that of Wichita , Kan. ) and relatively homogeneous countries with egalitarian cultures and institutions that can not readily be replicated in a large , dynamic , and diverse country such as the United States ; they are in many ways more capitalistic and investment-friendly than the United States is , and — American progressives , take note — their generous welfare benefits are funded by taxes on the middle class that are radically higher than anything Democratic politicians in the United States would be willing to countenance . Indeed , American progressives , with a very few intellectually honest exceptions , argue that middle-class Americans are paying taxes that are too high already , and can not bring themselves to speak honestly about what kind of middle-class tax burden would be necessary to provide Americans with the sort of social-welfare benefits on offer in , say , Sweden .
Of course , there are some moral questions involved in this . Some people think it ’ s a moral imperative to have a Scandinavian-style welfare state , and some people think it ’ s a moral imperative to not have one . But the question about taxes is , largely , a technical one , not a moral one . If government is going to spend x , then it is going to need to collect x in taxes — either now , or it can run deficits in the present and collect the same taxes in the future with interest . There isn ’ t any perfect tax regime , but there are better and worse ones . For example , some taxes — American corporate taxes , for example — can get very , very complicated , and so complying with them in the most efficient way is very , very expensive for taxpayers . General Electric spends a ton of money figuring out how to not pay any more tax than it has to . From the taxpayer ’ s point of view , if it costs $ 1 to figure out how to pay $ 1 of tax , then the tax may as well be $ 2 ; but from the tax-collector ’ s point of view , that ’ s out of whack : You ’ re only getting 50 cents on the dollar of your victims ’ beloved citizens ’ tax expenditures . You ’ d rather get 99.9 cents on the dollar of tax pain inflicted — your bosses have to run for reelection , after all .
Taxes can also distort individuals ’ and businesses ’ economic activity . When Dwight Eisenhower got a $ 1 million book advance , he figured out a way to take that payment as a capital gain rather than as ordinary income , which is taxed at a much higher rate . Those Wall Street executives and Fortune 500 CEOs who are so intensely hated by people who couldn ’ t explain to you what they actually do often have their compensation structured in such a way as to minimize the tax owed on it . ( Progressives once argued that giving top executives stock in lieu of cash was a good way to make sure that CEOs ’ incentives were better aligned with those of the shareholders whom they serve ; progressives tend to change their minds about these things an awful lot . ) A few years back , the big thing was “ corporate inversions ” in which a U.S.-based company merges with a firm in a lower-tax country ( Ireland and the Netherlands were hot destinations ) and legally domiciles itself there for tax purposes . You end up with businesses making a lot of decisions that are inefficient from a production point of view but efficient from a tax point of view . That ’ s pretty much the definition of a bad tax system : when the tax code leaves businesses better off making what would otherwise be bad business decisions .
So , ideally , you want a tax system with low transaction costs ( meaning a low cost of compliance ) and one that doesn ’ t distort a lot of economic activity . You want to get enough money to fund your government programs with as little disruption to life as possible . It ’ s not obvious how to go about doing that , and often our conversations about taxes are really obscuring more fundamental conversations about the things our taxes fund . We disagree about a great many things , and the best way forward is not always self-evident .
That ’ s the kind of conversation you have when you have a normal liberal democracy with a functioning civic culture and a political discourse conducted by more or less normal adults . We have Senator Crazypants and Senator Crazierpants .
Senator Elizabeth Warren ( Democrat , Radcliffe Quad ) and Senator Bernie Sanders ( Socialist , Further ) both want to be the Democratic party ’ s presidential nominee in 2020 . It ’ s hard to blame them — it ’ s an excellent grift , and these are grifters nonpareil . ( If you think Senator Sanders ’ s rape-porn columns were embarrassing , try Senator Warren ’ s Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan , from back in her days as a conservative-ish Lou Dobbs economic populist . ) Sure , Senator Warren is the national hall monitor and Senator Sanders is one sandwich board shy of lecturing lampposts about Lyndon LaRouche , but they think Donald Trump is going to be easy pickin ’ s . ( The 2020 election will be , among other things , a dynamic illustration of the principle that you can not reason a man out of a belief he was not reasoned into . ) But you can ’ t take a swing at the big orange piñata until you win the primary , and the Democrats are huffing out of the same brown paper bag as the Republicans , which means they ’ re in the market for crazy . And so Senator Warren and Senator Sanders are trading paint at high speed in the Bats * * t 500 .
Senator Warren has proposed a 2 percent wealth tax on certain affluent Americans — not a tax on their incomes , but a tax on their savings . Senator Sanders — metaphorically banging a shoe on the podium in his soul while shouting “ We will bury you ! ” — multiplied by four , suggesting an 8 percent tax on savings . There are other countries that have wealth taxes ( usually more broadly applied than Senator Sanders or Senator Warren proposes ; again , Democrats are very dedicated to the proposition that the American middle class should be exempted from paying very much for the welfare system of which it is the primary beneficiary ) , but very few of them even reach 1 percent , much less 8 percent : Norway ’ s wealth tax is less than 1 percent , and Switzerland ’ s begins at 13 one-hundredths of 1 percent . Austria , Denmark , Sweden , and Germany , among others , once had wealth taxes but eliminated them because — this part should matter — they are usually really , really bad policy .
Remember , though , that Barack Obama was all in favor of bad tax policy — if it hurt the right people . But some rich people are more evil than others . Democrats greeted the grievously misnamed Affordable Care Act as the product of something just short of divine intervention — but they have consistently refused to implement the taxes in the bill that were intended to help pay for it . Senator Warren , you may recall , bitterly opposed the ACA ’ s tax on medical devices , a lot of which just happen to be sold by companies headquartered within creeping distance of the Harvard Law School and Senator Warren ’ s multimillion-dollar Cambridge home . Everybody knew that was how it was going to turn out . All of the Vox types insisting that the ACA would lower the deficit were dishonestly counting taxes and other measures they knew were never going to be implemented ; and it wasn ’ t just National Review making that argument at the time — if the Congressional Budget Office had rolled its eyes any harder at the Obama administration ’ s forecasts , Douglas Elmendorf would have been staring at his own prefrontal cortex . Everybody knew that was horsepucky , and everybody knows this wealth-tax talk is horsepucky , too — it ’ s rube bait for the Iowa caucuses .
But when it comes to shameless crazy , Senator Sanders is always ready to throw down . Not satisfied with a nonsensical wealth tax that is never going to be enacted or implemented , he has now unveiled a nonsensical inequality tax that is never going to be enacted or implemented . The proposal — which is economically insane and probably illegal — would impose a punitive tax on companies unless they adhered to certain ratio of executive pay to that of the average worker . Of course it ’ s dumb and destructive — that ’ s the point .
When politicians fail at the basics of governance — and ours have failed and are failing — they embrace moral crusades and moral hysterias .

That kind of hysteria isn ’ t worth much , but it doesn ’ t cost much , either .","President Barack Obama delivers his State of the Union speech, January 28, 2014. (Larry Downing/Reuters)

When politicians fail at the basics of governance, they embrace moral crusades and moral hysterias.

Perhaps the strangest utterance of Barack Obama’s career in public office — a career that was full of utterly bizarre pronunciations of many kinds on many subjects — was his 2008 claim that raising taxes on the wealthy is a moral imperative, even if the tax increase in question ended up reducing overall federal revenue.

Which is to say, Obama argued that it did not matter whether a tax increase hurt the Treasury, so long as it also hurt, at least in theory and on paper, certain wealthy people. That wasn’t a one-off: In his crackpot speech in Osawatomie, Kan., during which he tried to reanimate Teddy Roosevelt’s “new nationalism” cult (this was back before progressives had decided that to use the word “nationalism” in public was akin to shouting “Sieg heil!”), he took a similarly moralizing approach. “Our tax code must reflect our values,” he proclaimed.

Why?

Here is a brief outline of how government under a liberal-democratic regime such as our own is supposed to work: People by nature have certain rights, and these do not come from the state; the American proposition is that we are endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights. Government does not give us these rights (life, liberty, and property prominent among them) but rather is an instrument we create to secure those rights. We do not give up our right to liberty or to property to the state — we can’t; that’s what “unalienable” means — but we can delegate some of our power to the state to protect them. Complementing that, we pool some of our resources to procure certain “public goods” such as courts of law and border guards, certain kinds of infrastructure, and the preservation of nature. None of that is free, and so we agree to pay certain taxes in order to secure both our own individual rights and certain shared interests.

Every system of taxation creates serious problems. Cities and school districts tax our houses and other real estate, which means that you never own your own home but are forever obliged in effect to rent it from the government; the federal government and most states tax our income, which means that you do not own the fruits of your own labor but rather are permitted to receive a portion of them at the sufferance of the state; etc. Intellectual careers have been dedicated to attempting to perfect taxation; 19th-century economist Henry George built a following that endures to this idea with his proposal to derive all government revenue from a single tax on the value of unimproved land. There are lots of big ideas — VAT, the so-called Fair Tax, the progressive income tax — but all of them create perverse incentives and unintentional consequences.

There are two ways around that. There is the American libertarian model, which more or less concedes that all tax regimes are destructive and at least partly immoral (say it with me: “Taxation is theft!”) and advocates limited government funded by low taxes. That’s the “necessary evil, but still evil” school of taxation. The leading intellectual competitor to that in the liberal-democratic world is the Scandinavian model, which combines relatively high taxes with generous social services administered by competent, honest, and transparent government, characterized by consensus-driven democratic politics with broad and deep popular buy-in. This is taxation not as transfer but as social insurance, with the state acting to even out the economic ups and downs of people’s lives — you pay high taxes when you’re younger and when you’re making more money to offset the difficulties of being old or sick.

American progressives tend to admire the Scandinavian model, and not without good reason: Countries such as Denmark and Sweden have their troubles, but they are generally quite happy, healthy, well-governed, and economically vibrant. Conservative critics point out that there is more to the story: These are relatively small (Iceland’s population is about that of Wichita, Kan.) and relatively homogeneous countries with egalitarian cultures and institutions that cannot readily be replicated in a large, dynamic, and diverse country such as the United States; they are in many ways more capitalistic and investment-friendly than the United States is, and — American progressives, take note — their generous welfare benefits are funded by taxes on the middle class that are radically higher than anything Democratic politicians in the United States would be willing to countenance. Indeed, American progressives, with a very few intellectually honest exceptions, argue that middle-class Americans are paying taxes that are too high already, and cannot bring themselves to speak honestly about what kind of middle-class tax burden would be necessary to provide Americans with the sort of social-welfare benefits on offer in, say, Sweden.

Of course, there are some moral questions involved in this. Some people think it’s a moral imperative to have a Scandinavian-style welfare state, and some people think it’s a moral imperative to not have one. But the question about taxes is, largely, a technical one, not a moral one. If government is going to spend x, then it is going to need to collect x in taxes — either now, or it can run deficits in the present and collect the same taxes in the future with interest. There isn’t any perfect tax regime, but there are better and worse ones. For example, some taxes — American corporate taxes, for example — can get very, very complicated, and so complying with them in the most efficient way is very, very expensive for taxpayers. General Electric spends a ton of money figuring out how to not pay any more tax than it has to. From the taxpayer’s point of view, if it costs $1 to figure out how to pay $1 of tax, then the tax may as well be $2; but from the tax-collector’s point of view, that’s out of whack: You’re only getting 50 cents on the dollar of your victims’ beloved citizens’ tax expenditures. You’d rather get 99.9 cents on the dollar of tax pain inflicted — your bosses have to run for reelection, after all.

Taxes can also distort individuals’ and businesses’ economic activity. When Dwight Eisenhower got a $1 million book advance, he figured out a way to take that payment as a capital gain rather than as ordinary income, which is taxed at a much higher rate. Those Wall Street executives and Fortune 500 CEOs who are so intensely hated by people who couldn’t explain to you what they actually do often have their compensation structured in such a way as to minimize the tax owed on it. (Progressives once argued that giving top executives stock in lieu of cash was a good way to make sure that CEOs’ incentives were better aligned with those of the shareholders whom they serve; progressives tend to change their minds about these things an awful lot.) A few years back, the big thing was “corporate inversions” in which a U.S.-based company merges with a firm in a lower-tax country (Ireland and the Netherlands were hot destinations) and legally domiciles itself there for tax purposes. You end up with businesses making a lot of decisions that are inefficient from a production point of view but efficient from a tax point of view. That’s pretty much the definition of a bad tax system: when the tax code leaves businesses better off making what would otherwise be bad business decisions.

So, ideally, you want a tax system with low transaction costs (meaning a low cost of compliance) and one that doesn’t distort a lot of economic activity. You want to get enough money to fund your government programs with as little disruption to life as possible. It’s not obvious how to go about doing that, and often our conversations about taxes are really obscuring more fundamental conversations about the things our taxes fund. We disagree about a great many things, and the best way forward is not always self-evident.

Advertisement

That’s the kind of conversation you have when you have a normal liberal democracy with a functioning civic culture and a political discourse conducted by more or less normal adults. We have Senator Crazypants and Senator Crazierpants.

Senator Elizabeth Warren (Democrat, Radcliffe Quad) and Senator Bernie Sanders (Socialist, Further) both want to be the Democratic party’s presidential nominee in 2020. It’s hard to blame them — it’s an excellent grift, and these are grifters nonpareil. (If you think Senator Sanders’s rape-porn columns were embarrassing, try Senator Warren’s Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan, from back in her days as a conservative-ish Lou Dobbs economic populist.) Sure, Senator Warren is the national hall monitor and Senator Sanders is one sandwich board shy of lecturing lampposts about Lyndon LaRouche, but they think Donald Trump is going to be easy pickin’s. (The 2020 election will be, among other things, a dynamic illustration of the principle that you cannot reason a man out of a belief he was not reasoned into.) But you can’t take a swing at the big orange piñata until you win the primary, and the Democrats are huffing out of the same brown paper bag as the Republicans, which means they’re in the market for crazy. And so Senator Warren and Senator Sanders are trading paint at high speed in the Bats**t 500.

Senator Warren has proposed a 2 percent wealth tax on certain affluent Americans — not a tax on their incomes, but a tax on their savings. Senator Sanders — metaphorically banging a shoe on the podium in his soul while shouting “We will bury you!” — multiplied by four, suggesting an 8 percent tax on savings. There are other countries that have wealth taxes (usually more broadly applied than Senator Sanders or Senator Warren proposes; again, Democrats are very dedicated to the proposition that the American middle class should be exempted from paying very much for the welfare system of which it is the primary beneficiary), but very few of them even reach 1 percent, much less 8 percent: Norway’s wealth tax is less than 1 percent, and Switzerland’s begins at 13 one-hundredths of 1 percent. Austria, Denmark, Sweden, and Germany, among others, once had wealth taxes but eliminated them because — this part should matter — they are usually really, really bad policy.

Remember, though, that Barack Obama was all in favor of bad tax policy — if it hurt the right people. But some rich people are more evil than others. Democrats greeted the grievously misnamed Affordable Care Act as the product of something just short of divine intervention — but they have consistently refused to implement the taxes in the bill that were intended to help pay for it. Senator Warren, you may recall, bitterly opposed the ACA’s tax on medical devices, a lot of which just happen to be sold by companies headquartered within creeping distance of the Harvard Law School and Senator Warren’s multimillion-dollar Cambridge home. Everybody knew that was how it was going to turn out. All of the Vox types insisting that the ACA would lower the deficit were dishonestly counting taxes and other measures they knew were never going to be implemented; and it wasn’t just National Review making that argument at the time — if the Congressional Budget Office had rolled its eyes any harder at the Obama administration’s forecasts, Douglas Elmendorf would have been staring at his own prefrontal cortex. Everybody knew that was horsepucky, and everybody knows this wealth-tax talk is horsepucky, too — it’s rube bait for the Iowa caucuses.

But when it comes to shameless crazy, Senator Sanders is always ready to throw down. Not satisfied with a nonsensical wealth tax that is never going to be enacted or implemented, he has now unveiled a nonsensical inequality tax that is never going to be enacted or implemented. The proposal — which is economically insane and probably illegal — would impose a punitive tax on companies unless they adhered to certain ratio of executive pay to that of the average worker. Of course it’s dumb and destructive — that’s the point.

When politicians fail at the basics of governance — and ours have failed and are failing — they embrace moral crusades and moral hysterias. That’s why New York City is proposing to put people in jail for using the perfectly accurate English words “illegal alien” to describe aliens whose presence in these United States is illegal — while the trains are failing, the schools continue to fail, the garbage piles up, and the police department continues its long history of acting as an organized-crime syndicate. Etc. One of the reasons you have a more libertarian view in the United States and more support for the welfare state in Sweden is that the Swedes can look at their government and say, “Oj, my taxes are higher than the Norralaån in springtime, but at least I get something for all that money.” People in New Jersey? Not really. We’ve seen veterans dying of preventable causes and pointy-headed little bureaucrats lying about it, and nice progressives getting very, very upset about that — and then saying what we really need is higher taxes on the rich so that we can bring the same model of care to everybody else in the country and make it mandatory.

“Excellent care at low cost,” Paul Krugman wrote of the VA system. Hence the relative libertarianism.

Punitive taxes aren’t about the taxes — they’re about the punishment. That taxation should have been converted from a technical question into a moral crusade speaks to the basic failure of the progressive enterprise in the United States and to the deficiency of American political discourse. Moral hysterias are always a distraction from problems that are, if seemingly intractable, much more ordinary. The specific contradiction in this case is the progressive demand for a Scandinavian welfare state at no cost to anybody they care about, which ends up being a very difficult equation to balance, probably an impossible one. And when the numbers don’t work, there’s always cheap moralistic histrionics.

That kind of hysteria isn’t worth much, but it doesn’t cost much, either.

taxes,USA TODAY,1,http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/05/06/online-sales-tax-effects/2115913/,Internet sales tax passes Senate,2013-05-06,Hadley Malcolm,"Big retailers like Walmart and Amazon are pitted against small online retailers
The Senate passed a bill Monday night aimed at making it easier for states to collect sales taxes for online purchases , but its final prospects remain uncertain .
Even so small online retailers are already thinking about the bill 's potentially large impact on their operations .
Nancy Mashragi would seriously consider reducing her sales to less than $ 1 million a year so she 'd be exempt from collecting sales tax from customers .
STAKES : Who would win or lose on online sales tax
Mashragi sells refurbished electronics through her eBay store , Concept Electronics . Last year she sold roughly $ 3 million worth of merchandise . But if the Senate passes the Marketplace Fairness Act tonight , she may cut iPads , which have a high cost but low profit margin , from her inventory so she 'd fall within the proposed $ 1 million small-seller exemption .
`` That 's something off the bat we 'd cut out because it 's not worth it for us , '' says Mashragi , who is based in Clearwater , Fla. , and collects sales taxes for purchases made by Florida residents . `` Why would we go through the hassle of going over that threshold and being responsible for all those taxes on something that has a very low profit margin ? ''
It 's a concern she and other small online retailers share . The bill , which passed the Senate 69-27 , now heads to the House , where it faces an uncertain future because some Republicans view it as a tax increase . President Obama has said he supports the bill .
The act would overturn decades-long precedent and leave many small online sellers with the task of figuring out how to manage collecting and remitting sales tax to nearly every state .
A 1992 Supreme Court case ruled that states could only require businesses to collect sales tax if the business had a physical presence in the state , such as a store or warehouse . Out-of-state retailers — back then the likes of catalogs more than websites — did not have to collect sales tax because it was deemed too difficult for them to abide by so many different tax jurisdictions and rules .
Now that online shopping has grown into a $ 226 billion-a-year business , and software makes collecting online sales tax across states easier , proponents of the Marketplace Fairness Act say requiring online businesses to comply with the same rules as bricks-and-mortar businesses is long overdue . The act would also require states to simplify their tax codes and provide retailers the software to assist in tax collection at no charge .
`` Not being able to compete on this is a frustration for retailers , '' says David French , senior vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation . `` ( Avoiding sales tax ) may not be a primary reason customers shop online , but it 's one of them . ''
The issue pits retail behemoths such as Walmart and Amazon against small online sellers such as those on eBay in a fight for price and industry dominance . Those in support of the bill , which include Walmart , Amazon and Target , argue they 're at a 5 % to 10 % price disadvantage by having to charge sales tax .

The measure would still have to pass the House

Big retailers like Walmart and Amazon are pitted against small online retailers

The Senate passed a bill Monday night aimed at making it easier for states to collect sales taxes for online purchases, but its final prospects remain uncertain.

Even so small online retailers are already thinking about the bill's potentially large impact on their operations.

Nancy Mashragi would seriously consider reducing her sales to less than $1 million a year so she'd be exempt from collecting sales tax from customers.

STAKES: Who would win or lose on online sales tax

Mashragi sells refurbished electronics through her eBay store, Concept Electronics. Last year she sold roughly $3 million worth of merchandise. But if the Senate passes the Marketplace Fairness Act tonight, she may cut iPads, which have a high cost but low profit margin, from her inventory so she'd fall within the proposed $1 million small-seller exemption.

FIRST TAKE: Internet taxation shapes Amazon-eBay battle

PROSPECTS: Bill faces hurdles in House

""That's something off the bat we'd cut out because it's not worth it for us,"" says Mashragi, who is based in Clearwater, Fla., and collects sales taxes for purchases made by Florida residents. ""Why would we go through the hassle of going over that threshold and being responsible for all those taxes on something that has a very low profit margin?""

CONSUMERS: Advocacy groups largely silent on sales tax

It's a concern she and other small online retailers share. The bill, which passed the Senate 69-27, now heads to the House, where it faces an uncertain future because some Republicans view it as a tax increase. President Obama has said he supports the bill.

The act would overturn decades-long precedent and leave many small online sellers with the task of figuring out how to manage collecting and remitting sales tax to nearly every state.

TIMES HAVE CHANGED

A 1992 Supreme Court case ruled that states could only require businesses to collect sales tax if the business had a physical presence in the state, such as a store or warehouse. Out-of-state retailers — back then the likes of catalogs more than websites — did not have to collect sales tax because it was deemed too difficult for them to abide by so many different tax jurisdictions and rules.

Now that online shopping has grown into a $226 billion-a-year business, and software makes collecting online sales tax across states easier, proponents of the Marketplace Fairness Act say requiring online businesses to comply with the same rules as bricks-and-mortar businesses is long overdue. The act would also require states to simplify their tax codes and provide retailers the software to assist in tax collection at no charge.

""Not being able to compete on this is a frustration for retailers,"" says David French, senior vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation. ""(Avoiding sales tax) may not be a primary reason customers shop online, but it's one of them.""

The issue pits retail behemoths such as Walmart and Amazon against small online sellers such as those on eBay in a fight for price and industry dominance. Those in support of the bill, which include Walmart, Amazon and Target, argue they're at a 5% to 10% price disadvantage by having to charge sales tax. States argue they're missing out on much-needed revenue. Last year, states could have collected more than $11 billion in online sales tax revenue, according to a study by the University of Tennessee.

""The attempt to do this was almost inevitable given the billions of dollars of transactions that are now being conducted electronically,"" says Dan Effron, a partner in the tax services group of Marcum LLP, an accounting and consulting firm.

-- The estimated cost of compliance to American taxpayers in 2010, including tax preparation fees, hours worked and other costs, according to the IRS.

It’s D-Day for President Obama’s health law as millions of American tax filers face the deadline for reporting their status under Obama’s new entitlement program and their vulnerability to new taxes used to fund it.

Americans have been paying the biggest new taxes associated with the law since the beginning of the year: a .9 percent income tax and a 3.8 percent tax on investment income, both for top earners.

While the estimated cost of those taxes is $318 billon over the next decade, like this year’s other big tax hike, the 48 percent jump in the payroll tax rate for all workers, they occur automatically and don’t create sticker shock except for those who count every penny in every paycheck.

Americans are also already living with two other costly tax increases in the law.

Those facing huge medical bills were previously able to deduct any expenses above 7.5 percent of their annual income. That’s now 10 percent. This is a relatively small number of people, mostly with serious illnesses, and the pinch won’t come until they file their taxes next year.

The other change is a new cap on health savings accounts, now set at $2,500. But consumers already got that word during the enrollment period for their health plans at the end of last year.

(The point of this regulation was more to discourage cash-based purchases of medical services and products and drive people into more expensive, comprehensive insurance plans to help insurance companies cover costs under the law.)

But today is the day when the compliance curve of the president’s law really starts to get steeper.

The Supreme Court ruled last year that whatever Obama and congressional Democrats called the penalty under the law for not having insurance, it is still a tax. And one can see why, since the initial point of contact for the uninsured with the law comes through the IRS.

The government will be using the tax returns due today to decide who will receive an estimated $25 billion in new insurance subsidies next year.

Enrollment in the new entitlement program is set to begin on Oct. 1. The complex process of enrollment looks to be an even more daunting task than tax preparation. And with many states functioning differently and delays piling up, it could be a real goat rope.

But whatever comes out and whenever it goes into place, the tax returns due today will provide the initial basis for how one’s relationship with the government and health insurance functions.

Williamson, Tobias Hoonhout, Victor Davis Hanson","The devil is in the details , and spending cuts would be needed to prevent the national debt from ballooning even further , but lower corporate-tax rates would be good for everyone .
Donald Trump is expected to announce his long-awaited tax-reform plan this week , the centerpiece of which is reportedly a reduction of the top federal corporate-tax rate from the current 35 percent to 15 percent . Even before the plan ’ s formal announcement , critics have reacted with predictable wailing and gnashing of teeth .
If they really care about helping workers and reducing poverty , they should rethink their opposition .
It is easy to cherry pick statistics in this debate . Supporters of corporate-tax reform point out that the United States has one of the highest effective marginal corporate-tax rates in the world at 38.9 percent when both state and federal taxes are considered . Critics counter that the effective average corporate rate is actually much lower , with estimates ranging from 23 percent to 34.9 percent . The effective average rate and the effective marginal rate are , of course , very different things .
The marginal tax rate reflects the amount of taxes that a company will pay on the next dollar of income earned , while the average effective tax rate is calculated based on the amount of taxes that companies actually pay after taking into account all exclusions and deductions .
Those who cite marginal tax rates in the corporate tax-reform debate have the better case for two reasons . First , it is marginal rates that most affect incentives , the willingness of companies to innovate , invest , and expand . Second , all the effort that companies put into reducing their effective tax rates is highly inefficient and distortionary . Companies should be making decisions based on what is best for business , not what is most likely to reduce taxes . In fact , American corporations currently spend some 240 million man-hours every year preparing their taxes , much of that devoted to attempts at reducing their tax burdens . And those efforts come at the expense of productivity and competitiveness .
More importantly , we should understand that corporations are largely collectors of taxes , rather than payers . The vast majority of corporate taxes are simply passed through , ultimately paid by investors , consumers , or employees . Remember Mitt Romney ’ s much derided comment that “ corporations are people , too ” ? In the case of corporate taxes , it ’ s entirely true .
Workers in particular appear to take much of the hit from higher corporate-tax rates . Because capital is mobile while labor is not , investors can often escape the pass-through of corporate taxation , while workers end up paying the price .
Several studies show that higher corporate taxes mean lower wages . For example , a 2007 EU Study found that “ a ten percentage point increase in the corporate tax rate of high-income countries reduces mean annual gross wages by seven percent. ” Another study , for the American Enterprise Institute , concluded that “ wages are significantly responsive to corporate taxation. ” And a study of state-level corporate taxes for the National Bureau of Economic Research found that cuts in corporate taxes benefit workers , especially unionized ones : “ A one percent lower state [ corporate ] tax rate is associated with a 0.36 percent higher union wage premium , suggesting that workers in a fully unionized firm capture roughly 54 percent of the benefits of low tax rates . ”
Moreover , studies suggest that low-wage workers are as likely to be hurt by high corporate taxes as their high-wage counterparts . That means that those who want to help low-wage workers escape poverty should be among the first to embrace corporate-tax reduction .
Of course , there are many unanswered questions around the Trump plan . While the proposed rate deduction has been leaked , few other details are yet available , and the devil will undoubtedly be in the details . It remains to be seen , for example , whether Trump ’ s proposal will include the much-debated Border Adjustment Tax , which would hit American consumers to the tune of $ 30 billion per year .

The devil is in the details, and spending cuts would be needed to prevent the national debt from ballooning even further, but lower corporate-tax rates would be good for everyone.

Donald Trump is expected to announce his long-awaited tax-reform plan this week, the centerpiece of which is reportedly a reduction of the top federal corporate-tax rate from the current 35 percent to 15 percent. Even before the plan’s formal announcement, critics have reacted with predictable wailing and gnashing of teeth.

If they really care about helping workers and reducing poverty, they should rethink their opposition.

It is easy to cherry pick statistics in this debate. Supporters of corporate-tax reform point out that the United States has one of the highest effective marginal corporate-tax rates in the world at 38.9 percent when both state and federal taxes are considered. Critics counter that the effective average corporate rate is actually much lower, with estimates ranging from 23 percent to 34.9 percent. The effective average rate and the effective marginal rate are, of course, very different things.

The marginal tax rate reflects the amount of taxes that a company will pay on the next dollar of income earned, while the average effective tax rate is calculated based on the amount of taxes that companies actually pay after taking into account all exclusions and deductions.

Those who cite marginal tax rates in the corporate tax-reform debate have the better case for two reasons. First, it is marginal rates that most affect incentives, the willingness of companies to innovate, invest, and expand. Second, all the effort that companies put into reducing their effective tax rates is highly inefficient and distortionary. Companies should be making decisions based on what is best for business, not what is most likely to reduce taxes. In fact, American corporations currently spend some 240 million man-hours every year preparing their taxes, much of that devoted to attempts at reducing their tax burdens. And those efforts come at the expense of productivity and competitiveness.

More importantly, we should understand that corporations are largely collectors of taxes, rather than payers. The vast majority of corporate taxes are simply passed through, ultimately paid by investors, consumers, or employees. Remember Mitt Romney’s much derided comment that “corporations are people, too”? In the case of corporate taxes, it’s entirely true.

Workers in particular appear to take much of the hit from higher corporate-tax rates. Because capital is mobile while labor is not, investors can often escape the pass-through of corporate taxation, while workers end up paying the price.

Several studies show that higher corporate taxes mean lower wages. For example, a 2007 EU Study found that “a ten percentage point increase in the corporate tax rate of high-income countries reduces mean annual gross wages by seven percent.” Another study, for the American Enterprise Institute, concluded that “wages are significantly responsive to corporate taxation.” And a study of state-level corporate taxes for the National Bureau of Economic Research found that cuts in corporate taxes benefit workers, especially unionized ones: “A one percent lower state [corporate] tax rate is associated with a 0.36 percent higher union wage premium, suggesting that workers in a fully unionized firm capture roughly 54 percent of the benefits of low tax rates.”

Moreover, studies suggest that low-wage workers are as likely to be hurt by high corporate taxes as their high-wage counterparts. That means that those who want to help low-wage workers escape poverty should be among the first to embrace corporate-tax reduction.

Of course, there are many unanswered questions around the Trump plan. While the proposed rate deduction has been leaked, few other details are yet available, and the devil will undoubtedly be in the details. It remains to be seen, for example, whether Trump’s proposal will include the much-debated Border Adjustment Tax, which would hit American consumers to the tune of $30 billion per year.

More concerning still is the proposal’s potential impact on the deficit. Because a reduction in corporate taxes would reduce the double taxation of some investment income, the Brookings Institution/Urban Institute Tax Policy Center estimates that it could result in a $2.4 trillion reduction in federal tax revenue over the next decade. The Trump administration expects economic growth to recoup most of this loss, but many experts are skeptical. Tax cuts do increase economic growth — and this one is particularly likely to do so — but they rarely “pay for themselves.” The administration’s continuing refusal to embrace spending cuts means that it runs the risk of ballooning our $20 trillion national debt in pursuit of (sorely needed) tax cuts.

Those concerns aside, though, lower corporate-tax rates should draw broad bipartisan support. As a reform, corporate-tax cuts are far more likely to help workers than trade wars or minimum-wage hikes. It is hard to see why — beyond reflexive “resistance” to Trump — anyone would oppose the idea.

“ There ’ s never been tax cuts like what we ’ re talking about , ” Mr. Trump , a Republican , said during a speech in Indiana in which he said the plan would boost economic growth and lead to a “ middle-class miracle . ”

Many Republicans expressed optimism Wednesday . But tax policy is notoriously thorny . Congress hasn ’ t overhauled the tax system in such an ambitious manner since 1986 .
“ If we can ’ t get this done , then frankly what can we do ? ” Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart ( R. , Fla. ) said .
Democrats , many of whom bashed the proposal as full of benefits for the richest households , are unlikely to give Republicans much help in passing a tax bill , forcing the GOP to work within its narrow majorities in the House and Senate .
“ When Donald Trump was talking about his plan in the last few days , he talked about the middle class and not helping the wealthy , ” said Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York , the chamber ’ s Democratic leader . “ The plan is a major disappointment because it so deviates from everything the president said . ”
The plan will move through Congress over the next few months . Lawmakers will first attempt to write a budget resolution that would allow the subsequent tax bill to pass on a simple-majority vote in the Senate . Then , the House and Senate will release the tax details .
Wednesday ’ s framework , written by six top negotiators from the House , Senate and Trump administration , calls for a 20 % corporate tax rate , down from 35 % today . Other companies , which pay their taxes through the individual returns of their owners , would get a 25 % top rate with unspecified rules that would prevent wealthy business owners from paying that rate on what is considered wage income .
Businesses could immediately deduct capital investments , except for buildings , for at least five years , instead of depreciating them over time as is the case today . The move is meant to spur spending on new machines and the workers needed to run them .
“ This is a supply-side approach that is going to lower the cost of capital , encourage investment , make America the best place in the world to invest money , and in the process we ’ re going to create incentives to expand America ’ s productive capacity , ” Sen. Pat Toomey ( R. , Pa. ) said .
Individual tax rates would be set at 12 % , 25 % and 35 % , with the option of a fourth higher rate on the highest-income households . The plan would repeal the alternative minimum tax and estate tax , a declaration that drew cheers at the House GOP retreat , according to a person in the room .
The tax cut for business investment , if approved by Congress , would be retroactive to Wednesday , but most of the other changes wouldn ’ t be retroactive , a senior administration official said .

The plan lays out new individual tax brackets , but it doesn ’ t say at what income thresholds those brackets would apply . The child tax credit would be increased , but it isn ’ t clear by how much .
Many lower- and middle-income households could benefit from the plan ’ s proposal to nearly double the basic standard deduction to $ 12,000 for individuals and $ 24,000 for married couples . But the elimination of the $ 4,050 personal exemption would take back much of that benefit .
Under current law , because of the personal exemption and standard deduction , a married couple with two children doesn ’ t pay taxes on the first $ 28,900 of income . That is bigger than the $ 24,000 standard deduction they would get under the proposal .
But the plan also calls for significantly increasing the child tax credit , which could prevent that family from seeing a tax increase . And it doesn ’ t offer details on how big the credit would be or whether it would be fully refundable . Two Republican senators , Mike Lee of Utah and Marco Rubio of Florida , said Wednesday the credit should at least be doubled .
Administration officials said that some families making under $ 100,000 and taking the standard deduction could save $ 1,000 a year . But within hours of the document ’ s release , groups allied with Democrats circulated scenarios in which low-income households and senior citizens could instead see their taxes rise .
Gregg Polsky , a tax-law professor at the University of Georgia , said the increase in the standard deduction , combined with the elimination of state and local tax deductibility , would give many households less incentive to itemize their tax deductions , making provisions like a mortgage-interest deduction less appealing .
Married taxpayers would have to have at least $ 24,000 in combined mortgage interest and charitable deductions to get any benefit at all from itemizing , something that has charities and real-estate agents concerned .
“ It keeps the mortgage deduction in name , but in practice only people with very large charitable contributions or million-dollar homes will benefit from it , ” Mr. Polsky said .
The plan doesn ’ t say how big a tax cut the Trump administration favors , but a senior administration official said the president would stand behind a Senate plan that would allow for a $ 1.5 trillion tax cut over the next decade .
Republicans said that faster economic growth will help the cuts at least partly pay for themselves over time and limit the impact of the changes on deficits and the national debt , which recently crossed $ 20 trillion . But just how much tax cuts affect growth is a point of disagreement among economists .
Mr. Trump , who had long favored a 15 % corporate tax rate , has two bright red lines as the debate goes forward , the senior administration official said . The president wants to stick to the 20 % corporate rate and wants to make sure the plan includes a middle-class tax cut .
The framework allows for an additional top tax rate on individuals above 35 % , “ to ensure that the reformed tax code is at least as progressive as the existing tax code and does not shift the tax burden from high-income to lower- and middle-income taxpayers . ”
Mr. Trump said high-income households , including his own , wouldn ’ t benefit . Mr. Trump has said his net worth is more than $ 10 billion .

Many Republicans expressed optimism Wednesday. But tax policy is notoriously thorny. Congress hasn’t overhauled the tax system in such an ambitious manner since 1986.

“If we can’t get this done, then frankly what can we do?” Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R., Fla.) said.

More on the Tax Plan

Democrats, many of whom bashed the proposal as full of benefits for the richest households, are unlikely to give Republicans much help in passing a tax bill, forcing the GOP to work within its narrow majorities in the House and Senate.

“When Donald Trump was talking about his plan in the last few days, he talked about the middle class and not helping the wealthy,” said Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the chamber’s Democratic leader. “The plan is a major disappointment because it so deviates from everything the president said.”

President Trump is starting his drive to push through Congress a big bill to both reform the tax system but also to cut taxes on businesses and some individuals and also streamline the tax code along the way.

Her Replacement Plan Would Likely Hurt Middle Class, Economy.",,,"It ’ s not at all surprising that a Democrat would call for higher taxes and spending while campaigning .
Sen. Kamala Harris ( D-CA ) , who is running for president , said recently she wants to repeal the entire 2017 tax law that cut taxes for the majority of Americans and replace it with a tax cut that doesn ’ t look like it will help many people . Also , she uses some fuzzy math to explain how repealing the Trump Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( TCJA ) will pay for her education plan even though she has her own tax plan that would replace them .
While campaigning in Detroit , Michigan , Harris said she ’ d “ get rid of the whole thing , ” referring to Trump ’ s tax cuts , which gave most Americans a bigger paycheck after they went into effect . Harris ’ campaign spokesman , Ian Sams , told Bloomberg that Harris would replace Trump ’ s tax cuts with her own plan , which would help fewer people . Harris ’ plan , called the Livable Incomes For Families Today ( LIFT ) Act , would ostensibly help low income and middle-class earners by providing them tax credits of up to $ 6,000 a year . From Bloomberg :
The credit would apply to households earning less than $ 100,000 annually . Single filers earning under $ 50,000 a year would get $ 3,000 . The credit could be accessed monthly or in one lump sum at the end of the year . It would begin to phase out for single taxpayers without children earning at least $ 30,000 , single taxpayers with children earning at least $ 80,000 , and married taxpayers earning at least $ 60,000 .
Perhaps this sounds good to people who don ’ t live in large cities , but as someone who built their career in the Washington , D.C. metropolitan area I struggle to see how this would have helped me .
Ryan Ellis , an expert in tax policy who worked for Grover Norquist for a decade , told me that Harris ’ plan , combined with the tax hikes that would hit middle- and lower-income Americans from repealing the Trump tax cuts , would end up raising taxes on net for many families .
“ For example , a family of four with two small kids making $ 90,000 per year would see a TCJA tax increase of $ 2600 , ” Ellis said . “ But they would only get an offsetting LIFT credit of $ 1500 . Interact the two , and it ’ s a tax hike of $ 1100 on this four-figure family . ”
Kyle Pomerleau , chief economist and vice president of economic analysis at the Tax Foundation , differed in his assessment of whether individual families would see a tax hike , but said Harris ’ plan would end up hurting the economy by discouraging labor force participation .
“ The TCJA did reduce taxes for the middle class . We estimated that the law boosted after-tax income by about 1.6 percent for middle-income taxpayers , ” Pomerleau told ███ in an email . “ In contrast , we estimate that LIFT would boost this same groups after-tax income by 5.6 percent . Thus the swap would mean the middle class would be a net beneficiary . ”
Pomerleau warned , however , that the tax hikes from repealing the TCJA would result in problems for the economy .
“ We estimated that the TCJA would boost economic output , wages , and jobs . For example , we think GDP would be about 1.7 percent larger in the long-run due to the TCJA , ” Pomerleau wrote . “ In contrast , the LIFT credit , due to discouraging labor force participation , would reduce output by about 0.8 percent . Overall , the swap would mean lower economic output . ”
Harris has another problem with the plan she discussed before the American Federation of Teachers : Math . Harris told the teachers she had a $ 315 billion plan that would raise the wages of public school teachers .
Sahil Kapur , one of the authors of the Bloomberg article mentioned above , said on Twitter there was a “ math imbalance in Harri ’ s trio of proposals . ”
“ She says she ’ ll repeal the GOP tax law ( + $ 1.9T ) and enact the LIFT Act ( - $ 2.8T ) plus her teacher pay plan ( - $ 315B ) , ” he tweeted . “ That ’ s still $ 1.2 trillion in the red . ”

He followed up that tweet with information from Harris ’ blueprint for her education plan , which said it would strengthen “ the estate tax ” and crack “ down on loopholes that let the very wealthiest , with estates worth multiple millions or billions of dollars , avoid paying their fair share . ”
A quick reminder of what the estate tax is : Someone with an estate , who has paid their taxes , dies . In order to collect their inheritance , an heir must pay additional taxes on what is left to them . It ’ s essentially a double tax scheme .","It’s not at all surprising that a Democrat would call for higher taxes and spending while campaigning.

“The TCJA did reduce taxes for the middle class. We estimated that the law boosted after-tax income by about 1.6 percent for middle-income taxpayers,” Pomerleau told The Daily Wire in an email. “In contrast, we estimate that LIFT would boost this same groups after-tax income by 5.6 percent. Thus the swap would mean the middle class would be a net beneficiary.”

Pomerleau warned, however, that the tax hikes from repealing the TCJA would result in problems for the economy.

“We estimated that the TCJA would boost economic output, wages, and jobs. For example, we think GDP would be about 1.7 percent larger in the long-run due to the TCJA,” Pomerleau wrote. “In contrast, the LIFT credit, due to discouraging labor force participation, would reduce output by about 0.8 percent. Overall, the swap would mean lower economic output.”

Harris has another problem with the plan she discussed before the American Federation of Teachers: Math. Harris told the teachers she had a $315 billion plan that would raise the wages of public school teachers.

Sahil Kapur, one of the authors of the Bloomberg article mentioned above, said on Twitter there was a “math imbalance in Harri’s trio of proposals.”

“She says she’ll repeal the GOP tax law (+$1.9T) and enact the LIFT Act (-$2.8T) plus her teacher pay plan (-$315B),” he tweeted. “That’s still $1.2 trillion in the red.”

He followed up that tweet with information from Harris’ blueprint for her education plan, which said it would strengthen “the estate tax” and crack “down on loopholes that let the very wealthiest, with estates worth multiple millions or billions of dollars, avoid paying their fair share.”

A quick reminder of what the estate tax is: Someone with an estate, who has paid their taxes, dies. In order to collect their inheritance, an heir must pay additional taxes on what is left to them. It’s essentially a double tax scheme.",www.dailywire.com,right,YsE8vtSVmEU6eNUi

More than 200 companies , including Home Depot Inc ( HD.N ) , American Airlines Group Inc ( AAL.O ) and AT & T Inc ( T.N ) , are giving bonuses to at least 3 million U.S. workers , according to the conservative Americans for Tax Reform group .
███ has interviewed people around the country on the benefits they have received so far . While they welcome the additional income , the cuts have largely not changed individuals ’ longstanding views on Trump or the two major political parties .
Working two jobs to make ends meet , 61-year-old Tim Smith was happy to get a $ 400 bonus as a part-time worker at Home Depot thanks to the U.S. tax overhaul , but his dislike for Trump and his policies remains .
“ What can I do with that ? Not a lot . Buy some groceries , maybe pay a bill or two . That ’ s it , ” said Smith , as he deposited materials for recycling at the Home Depot where he works . He figured that after taxes , the bonus netted him $ 280 .
Home Depot last month announced it would give its hourly workers a bonus of up to $ 1,000 as a result of Trump ’ s tax plan .
“ I did benefit , yes , but , I believe , in seven years , anything we get is going to disappear , ” said Smith , adding he believed the tax plan was a “ rip-off ” that would help the wealthy and add $ 1 trillion to the national debt .
Smith , who sports a long pony tail , lives with his wife in the Fort Lauderdale suburb of Oakland Park , where he owns a home . Their two children are off to college .
He says the middle-class will eventually pay for the tax breaks , in cuts to programs such as Medicaid , Medicare and Social Security .
“ That money ’ s got to come from somewhere , and it ’ s going to wind up coming from the middle-class , ” said Smith , who made about $ 55,000 in 2017 from the two jobs he works .
A graduate of the University of Rhode Island with a degree in history and political science , Smith said he moved to Florida in 1991 and took any job he could .
He has worked part time for Home Depot for 10 years , on top of working full-time at an aluminum processing company , which did not pay a tax-related bonus . Smith said he will probably work until he is 70 .
Asked how he felt about Trump , Smith said : “ To be honest , I can ’ t stand the man . ”
Trump supporter Will Ortega , 32 , was happy to see trickle-down economics in action when he got a bigger paycheck due to the tax cuts .
A supervisor at an infrastructure safety company , which controls traffic during highway renovation projects in San Antonio , Ortega ’ s take-home bimonthly paycheck went up by $ 50 , and he knew exactly what to do with it .
“ Lunch money , ” he said , sitting at his desk wearing his neon yellow work clothes . “ I was real careful with how I spent my money on food . Now it ’ s like if I want to go out to eat an extra day or not wake up early to make lunch , I don ’ t have to worry about it . ”
Ortega , who lives with his girlfriend and their 1-year-old daughter , makes about $ 50,000 a year .
“ I ’ m a firm believer in the trickle-down economics of it , he said . “ I ’ m real happy that my boss got a tax break , given he ’ s not a Fortune 500 CEO . ”
Ortega said his boss was investing back into the company , which benefited all the workers .
“ He ’ s making more money , and in turn , we just picked up two brand new trucks , so it ’ s a lot more comfortable for the guys to work in . We ’ re also able to hire more guys and take some of the workload off us , ” he said .
When it comes to Trump , Ortega said he would vote for him again , despite his dislike of Trump ’ s social media presence .
“ As a celebrity on social media , I think he ’ s worthless and I can ’ t stand him . As for the policies he ’ s put into effect and the progress he ’ s making , I couldn ’ t be happier , ” he said .
An administrative assistant at a university outside Boston , Liz Hammond , 36 , was skeptical the tax cuts passed by Congress in December would mean much for her financially . And then her paycheck rose by about $ 5 a week .
Hammond , who lives in Somerville with her boyfriend and cat , said she fears that the tax package will lead to cuts down the road in social spending programs .
“ I have friends who are on food stamps and disability and things like that , and we don ’ t have a ( federal ) budget sorted out and I am terrified we ’ ll lose these programs , ” Hammond said , adding that she would gladly have given up the tax cut if it protected those programs .
Hammond said she did not vote for Trump and was no likelier to vote for his re-election . The new law cut the federal income tax rate on her roughly $ 45,000 salary to 22 percent from 25 percent , a cut that is set to expire in 10 years .
“ When I ’ ve finished paying off my student loans and start to accumulate money and maybe think about saving for a house , it ’ s not going to be there , ” Hammond said . “ I don ’ t know anyone who is benefiting from this . ”
Jeff Anderson , a 33-year-old account manager for a software company in Lincoln , Nebraska , said he received a $ 1,000 bonus because of the tax cut , about $ 600 after taxes .
“ I was able to purchase a few things I ’ ve been putting off , ” Anderson said . “ My computer was failing so I built a new one . I bought a few books . The remainder is in savings , just in case . ”
A registered Democrat who said the bonus represents less than 1 percent of his annual salary , Anderson describes himself as “ socially liberal , fiscally conservative . ”
Anderson lives with his wife in a modest brick home , where he spends his free time brewing craft beer , cooking , gardening and doing home improvement projects .
Although Anderson did not read the tax cut legislation , he feels the benefits depend on demographics .
“ I have a feeling the effects will be as varied as the people who make up this country , ” he said .

taxes,National Review,2,https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/04/millionaire-taxes-do-not-solve-state-fiscal-problems/,Millionaire’s Taxes Offer Little Bang and Little Buck,2018-04-18,"Jonathan Williams, Ross Marchand, Jim Geraghty, Kyle Smith, Luke Thompson, Zachary Evans, David French, Michael Brendan Dougherty, Kevin D. Williamson, Tobias Hoonhout","Millions of Americans are beginning to see the fruits of the federal tax overhaul passed in December , with higher take-home pay , bonuses , and a stronger job market . However , these good times could soon end in some left-leaning states that are considering raising their income taxes . New Jersey , Massachusetts , and Maine may soon place surtaxes on “ millionaires , ” via legislation in the Garden State and ballot measures in the others . To proponents of larger government and greater state-level redistribution , raising rates on “ fat cats ” is a perfect way to fund more Medicaid and anti-poverty spending , which is perceived to be under threat at the federal level .
A silver lining for state tax battles in 2018 is that supporters of tax increases have a new problem to deal with , due to the passage of federal tax reform : The limitation of the state and local tax ( SALT ) deduction . The provision , which President Ronald Reagan called the “ most sacred ” of cows in the tax code when he attempted to repeal it in 1986 , was previously unlimited and gave state and local governments a harmful incentive to increase their taxes and spending . States could then take advantage of the federal subsidy by socializing their excess costs to taxpayers from other states . Now , instead of having the unlimited ability to “ write off ” state and local tax burdens on federal returns , individual taxpayers who itemize are limited to a $ 10,000 annual deduction . That just might bring about the political opposition necessary to stop many tax increases .
It explains why liberal governors , such as New York ’ s Andrew Cuomo and California ’ s Jerry Brown , have been up in arms about federal tax reform , despite all the demonstrated benefits Americans are enjoying . After explaining that one of his first priorities for 2018 would be a “ millionaire ’ s ” tax increase , New Jersey state-senate president Steve Sweeney recently admitted that the removal of the SALT deduction could force him to “ reevaluate everything. ” These policy debates give us all a clear demonstration of why limiting the SALT deduction was an essential element of the 2017 federal tax reform . We can only hope the SALT deduction is fully eliminated in the next round of federal tax changes .
An additional problem for proponents of “ millionaire ’ s taxes ” is economics . Progressives take it for granted that tax hikes will actually raise the amount of new revenue they desire . Unfortunately for the tax-and-spend crowd , the tax increases they seek run headlong into a basic economic principle : The Laffer curve .

Soaking the rich is good politics but bad economics.

Millions of Americans are beginning to see the fruits of the federal tax overhaul passed in December, with higher take-home pay, bonuses, and a stronger job market. However, these good times could soon end in some left-leaning states that are considering raising their income taxes. New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Maine may soon place surtaxes on “millionaires,” via legislation in the Garden State and ballot measures in the others. To proponents of larger government and greater state-level redistribution, raising rates on “fat cats” is a perfect way to fund more Medicaid and anti-poverty spending, which is perceived to be under threat at the federal level.

A silver lining for state tax battles in 2018 is that supporters of tax increases have a new problem to deal with, due to the passage of federal tax reform: The limitation of the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. The provision, which President Ronald Reagan called the “most sacred” of cows in the tax code when he attempted to repeal it in 1986, was previously unlimited and gave state and local governments a harmful incentive to increase their taxes and spending. States could then take advantage of the federal subsidy by socializing their excess costs to taxpayers from other states. Now, instead of having the unlimited ability to “write off” state and local tax burdens on federal returns, individual taxpayers who itemize are limited to a $10,000 annual deduction. That just might bring about the political opposition necessary to stop many tax increases.

It explains why liberal governors, such as New York’s Andrew Cuomo and California’s Jerry Brown, have been up in arms about federal tax reform, despite all the demonstrated benefits Americans are enjoying. After explaining that one of his first priorities for 2018 would be a “millionaire’s” tax increase, New Jersey state-senate president Steve Sweeney recently admitted that the removal of the SALT deduction could force him to “reevaluate everything.” These policy debates give us all a clear demonstration of why limiting the SALT deduction was an essential element of the 2017 federal tax reform. We can only hope the SALT deduction is fully eliminated in the next round of federal tax changes.

An additional problem for proponents of “millionaire’s taxes” is economics. Progressives take it for granted that tax hikes will actually raise the amount of new revenue they desire. Unfortunately for the tax-and-spend crowd, the tax increases they seek run headlong into a basic economic principle: The Laffer curve. Named after the legendary economist and Reagan economic adviser Arthur Laffer, it illustrates the damaging impact that excessive tax rates have on incentives for individuals to engage in economic activity and shows how tax increases can lead to much lower tax receipts than official static government estimates project. This isn’t just an economic theory for an economics classroom, either. Ample data on interstate migration caused by tax changes testify to the truth of the Laffer curve.

The no-income-tax states have outperformed their high-tax counterparts in terms of personal-income growth, migration, and even tax-receipt growth for decades.

Making some cuts temporary or gradual

Republican lawmakers are selling their plan as a middle-class tax cut, and the bill is expected to create three income tax brackets — 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent — and call for doubling the standard deduction. Yet lawmakers are considering making these changes temporary, so they would expire after 10 years.

Limiting the estate tax

The original framework called for repealing the estate tax, which would reduce federal revenues by $239 billion over a decade.

Estates are taxed at a rate of 40 percent, but the first $5.49 million of an inheritance is exempt from taxation. Couples can leave their heirs as much as $11 million, none of it taxed, meaning only a few thousand wealthy estates are subject to the tax each year.",www.nytimes.com,left,S8XvGNMGcuzhW73O

In particular , we want to look at the latest numbers from the Congressional Budget Office .
The CBO report , which came out Sunday , was unusual because it does not just look at the Senate bill ’ s impact on people ’ s taxes . It also analyzes spending cuts the GOP tax plan would trigger , and how those cuts would affect the rich and poor .
As you will see , our analysis of the new data shows the Senate Republicans ’ bill would move resources away from lower-income Americans and toward upper and upper-middle class Americans .
Highlighted in red , you can see lower-income groups face overall losses , per person or family , in this plan . But take a closer look at the amounts . The size of the losses for lower incomes is dwarfed by the massive gains — up to $ 59,000 per tax filer — at the upper end of the income scale .
Ok , but don ’ t the wealthy get more of a nominal benefit because they have much larger incomes ? Isn ’ t it all nearly even when you factor in the higher and lower incomes involved ?
Actually , no . We took the midpoint for income in each group ( for example , $ 15,000 for those earning between $ 10,000 and $ 20,000 ) and divided the overall effect on the group by that income amount . The result ? As you can see in the next chart , the wealthy not only gain the most in dollar amounts but they also gain the most relative to their income .
For instance , Americans making $ 10,000 to $ 20,000 would see barely any change — a loss worth just 0.14 percent of their income next year . But Americans making $ 500,000 to $ 1 million next year would see a net benefit that ’ s worth nearly 3 percent of their income .
And a final question what about the population size of each group ? Doesn ’ t that change the math here ? Again , no .
Below , we crunched the data for the percentage of federal tax returns which come from each income group , and compared that to relative size of the benefit or loss for each group .
Our numbers show a very clear reversal : lower income groups have larger amounts of taxpayers but would benefit far less from this tax overhaul . Higher income groups have far fewer taxpayers , and would gain many times more from the GOP bill .
Of course , Republicans correctly point out that the wealthy , while fewer in number , pay for a much larger portion of U.S. taxes than other groups . It ’ s part of their argument for a sweeping change that goes well beyond tax cuts or tax reform .
But these numbers show what conservatives rarely say directly these days — that they believe the U.S. tax system is too progressive , and moves too many resources from the rich to the poor .

As you will see, our analysis of the new data shows the Senate Republicans’ bill would move resources away from lower-income Americans and toward upper and upper-middle class Americans.

How much each family or taxpayer gains or loses

We started by looking at what the tax bill means for each person or family. (Note: A “tax unit” is one person or group filing one tax return. So an individual could be one tax unit and a married couple filing jointly could be one.)

Highlighted in red, you can see lower-income groups face overall losses, per person or family, in this plan. But take a closer look at the amounts. The size of the losses for lower incomes is dwarfed by the massive gains — up to $59,000 per tax filer — at the upper end of the income scale.

Ok, but don’t the wealthy get more of a nominal benefit because they have much larger incomes? Isn’t it all nearly even when you factor in the higher and lower incomes involved?

Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz , who is also a congresswoman from Florida , has drafted a bill to restore money both parties used to get from the federal government to help defray the costs of running their quadrennial conventions .
The Congressional Budget Office revealed the move in a letter released Friday , which said Ms. Wasserman Schultz ’ s proposal to tap a presidential campaign fund would likely mean each party could get about $ 20 million in taxpayer money to help with their costs .
The DNC is facing tough financial circumstances , with the latest report showing it had just $ 4.7 million cash on hand as of Oct. 31 , or less than the $ 6.9 million in debts the committee reported . By contrast the Republican National Committee reported $ 20.4 million in cash , offset by just $ 1.9 million in debts .
Neither the DNC nor Ms. Wasserman Schultz ’ s congressional office returned messages seeking comment on her plans .
Republican National Committee spokeswoman Allison Moore said the GOP doesn ’ t need the help .
“ We support no taxpayer funding as long as there ’ s an alternate way for us to raise the funds to mount a successful convention , ” she said in an email .
It was only last year that lawmakers nixed money for the conventions , deciding the political parties and their presidential nominees — who each raised $ 1 billion in 2012 — didn ’ t need help from taxpayers anymore .
Congress instead called for the money to be used to finance research on children ’ s diseases at the National Institutes of Health .
Months after the change , however , the two parties began to worry that they wouldn ’ t be able to pay for their conventions . Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress struck a deal to raise the contribution limits so donors could now give nearly $ 100,000 to convention funds , in addition to other contributions , whose limits were also raised .
The GOP appears to have done better under the new rules than the DNC , which is experiencing a troubled financial picture . It has raised $ 51.2 million this year through Oct. 31 , but spent $ 53.4 million — a bad balance in the year before a major election .
The RNC has raised $ 89.3 million and spent $ 74 million . It has stockpiled $ 20.4 million in cash .
The CBO said Ms. Wasserman Schultz ’ s legislation would tap into the Presidential Election Campaign Fund — the money taxpayers can earmark on their annual tax forms to help defray the costs of presidential campaigns — and make it available to political conventions .
Both President Obama and GOP nominee Mitt Romney rejected public financing in 2012 , deciding they didn ’ t want to comply with the strict spending limits that they feared would crimp their ability to flood the airwaves with ads .
That ’ s left the presidential fund with about $ 290 million . The CBO said based on spending in the 2012 conventions , each party would likely get about $ 20 million under the congresswoman ’ s proposal .
Based on previous conventions , that would amount to about a quarter of the total cost .
The ban on funding for conventions doesn ’ t apply to security money . Congress has earmarked about $ 50 million to help defray costs to state and local law enforcement for securing each convention site since the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
Democrats will gather next year in Philadelphia , while Republicans will hold their convention in Cleveland .","Already struggling with finances, the Democratic Party has drafted a plan to have taxpayers help pay about $20 million for next summer’s nominating convention, reversing a change Congress approved just a year ago.

The Congressional Budget Office revealed the move in a letter released Friday, which said Ms. Wasserman Schultz’s proposal to tap a presidential campaign fund would likely mean each party could get about $20 million in taxpayer money to help with their costs.

The DNC is facing tough financial circumstances, with the latest report showing it had just $4.7 million cash on hand as of Oct. 31, or less than the $6.9 million in debts the committee reported. By contrast the Republican National Committee reported $20.4 million in cash, offset by just $1.9 million in debts.

Neither the DNC nor Ms. Wasserman Schultz’s congressional office returned messages seeking comment on her plans.

Republican National Committee spokeswoman Allison Moore said the GOP doesn’t need the help.

“We support no taxpayer funding as long as there’s an alternate way for us to raise the funds to mount a successful convention,” she said in an email.

It was only last year that lawmakers nixed money for the conventions, deciding the political parties and their presidential nominees — who each raised $1 billion in 2012 — didn’t need help from taxpayers anymore.

Congress instead called for the money to be used to finance research on children’s diseases at the National Institutes of Health.

Months after the change, however, the two parties began to worry that they wouldn’t be able to pay for their conventions. Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress struck a deal to raise the contribution limits so donors could now give nearly $100,000 to convention funds, in addition to other contributions, whose limits were also raised.

The GOP appears to have done better under the new rules than the DNC, which is experiencing a troubled financial picture. It has raised $51.2 million this year through Oct. 31, but spent $53.4 million — a bad balance in the year before a major election.

The RNC has raised $89.3 million and spent $74 million. It has stockpiled $20.4 million in cash.

The CBO said Ms. Wasserman Schultz’s legislation would tap into the Presidential Election Campaign Fund — the money taxpayers can earmark on their annual tax forms to help defray the costs of presidential campaigns — and make it available to political conventions.

Both President Obama and GOP nominee Mitt Romney rejected public financing in 2012, deciding they didn’t want to comply with the strict spending limits that they feared would crimp their ability to flood the airwaves with ads.

That’s left the presidential fund with about $290 million. The CBO said based on spending in the 2012 conventions, each party would likely get about $20 million under the congresswoman’s proposal.

Based on previous conventions, that would amount to about a quarter of the total cost.

The ban on funding for conventions doesn’t apply to security money. Congress has earmarked about $50 million to help defray costs to state and local law enforcement for securing each convention site since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

Democrats will gather next year in Philadelphia, while Republicans will hold their convention in Cleveland.

Now it’s time for spending restraint.

Republicans have had their spoonful of sugar. Time for the medicine.

Taking the ever-popular dessert-first approach to fiscal policy, Republicans have delivered a very large tax cut. It has some good features: It lowers the U.S. statutory corporate-tax rate, formerly one of the highest in the world, to 21 percent, more in keeping with other advanced economies; it expands the standard deduction; it raises the threshold for the estate tax, which will be of great interest to those of you with parents worth more than the previous limit of $11.2 million; it caps, though it fails to eliminate, the deduction for state and local taxes, which is both good policy and SALT in the wounds of Democrats from high-tax states such as California and New Jersey.

It will also add about $1.5 trillion to the national debt.

Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has said that Republicans have every intention of making permanent the individual tax cuts, which currently are scheduled to expire in ten years. The Republicans had to make those “temporary” on paper in order to comply with budget rules. Which is to say, the speaker has acknowledged that the accounting shenanigans used to get this bill passed in the teeth of statutory spending constraints are basically bullsh**. But there’s a lot of bullsh** going around Washington just now.

Time to eat your spinach, Washington.

The United States is on an unsustainable fiscal trajectory. That does not mean that there is an economic crisis right around the corner, today, tomorrow, or in six months. But if nothing is done, entitlement spending will grow beyond our ability to pay for it, even with substantial future tax increases. Military spending is a heavy contributor to our fiscal burden, too, and it could and should be reduced, but that will first require rethinking our national-security posture and our worldwide military capabilities. For the military, the mission determines the budget, but much of federal spending would be more properly organized the other way around.

When Republican Mike Pence replaced Mitch Daniels as governor of Indiana this month, he wasted no time setting out to establish his conservative fiscal bona fides.



Pence, who made a name for himself in the U.S. House as a social conservative, rolled out a proposal to cut Indiana's state income tax rate by 10 percent over the next two years. He joined Louisiana's Bobby Jindal, Wisconsin's Scott Walker, Nebraska's Dave Heineman and other Republican governors in pushing for state income tax cuts.

In theory, it should be an easy sell for Pence. Indiana has a projected budget surplus of $518 million next year. And like 24 other Republican governors this year, Pence enjoys Republican majorities in the Legislature to work with. In fact, Pence enjoys Republican supermajorities in each chamber.

But it may be harder than Pence expected. Prominent Republican lawmakers in Indiana are lukewarm at best on the new governor's tax cut plan, preferring to replenish funding to programs the recession forced them to cut and shore up Indiana's budget for the long haul.

""I was here in 1998 when we had a $2 billion surplus,"" Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma told reporters last week. ""I was here and became speaker in 2004 when we were $1.4 billion in the red. This isn't a two-year budget cycle concern. This is a long-term sustainability issue for the state of Indiana.""

Indiana isn't the only state where Republicans are debating what tax cuts should look like. In Iowa, Republican Gov. Terry Branstad wants to use a nearly $1 billion budget surplus to fund a cut in commercial property taxes and increase funding for schools. However, Republican leaders in the House and Senate would rather give all 2.1 million Iowa taxpayers a one-time tax credit of $375. Republicans control the House in Iowa, but Democrats have the Senate.

In Indiana, Bosma and some other Republican legislative leaders would rather return the budget surplus to the state's public schools. In the depths of the recession, Daniels cut $300 million from Indiana's K-12 budget. It was a choice many states made during the recession, often reluctantly.

Now, state revenues have crept back to pre-recession levels in Indiana and 24 other states, the National Conference of State Legislatures reports. Ten other states aren't far behind. So while Washington debates what programs to cut to balance the federal budget, many states are in a position to restore funding for programs they'd cut previously.

The debate is over how much money to restore — and to what programs. Pence's budget would increase K-12 funding by $137 million over the next two years, boosting funding for Indiana's new full-day kindergarten program.

But some Indiana Democrats say Pence's increase doesn't restore all of the education dollars Daniels cut in 2009. And Bosma says he'd prefer to restore even more money to public schools, although he declines to say how much.

""We were around for the cuts in that regard,"" Bosma says, ""so we indicated we would seek to strategically restore those where we could. We will probably invest more in that direction.""

Bosma also doesn't like Pence's idea of holding back on transportation or infrastructure spending unless the state's budget reserves exceed a certain amount.

Pence counters that there's enough money in the bank for modest increases in K-12 funding and his tax cut, too. He says his plan would still leave Indiana's budget in the black for the next two fiscal years.

""Government should only collect what it needs,"" Pence said in his State of the State address Tuesday. ""When government collects more than it needs, it should return that money to the hardworking taxpayers who earned it in the first place.""

While Bosma says he's not convinced that would be the best thing for the state's long-term fiscal health, he says his lines of communication with the governor's office are open.

""We've both been very respectful of each other,"" Bosma said last week. ""[Gov. Pence] has said his job is going to be to convince us otherwise, and my job is going to be to assure that taxpayers are protected not just for two years but for the long haul.""

The letter, put together by Responsible Wealth, a network that promotes progressive issues, says the GOP plan should increase taxes on the wealthy.

Some people who have signed onto the letter include Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream founders Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, fashion designer Eileen Fisher, billionaire hedge fund manager George Soros and philanthropist Steven Rockefeller.

House Republicans are nearing an initial victory on tax reform. Legislation is expected to get a vote this week on the House floor.

Senate Republicans released their own tax bill last week — a measure that has several differences from the House bill.

The Senate bill cuts individual and corporate tax rates and eliminates some tax preferences in the current code, but not as many as are repealed in the House bill.

Democrats have criticized the plan.

Two weeks ago he noticed an extra $100 in his bimonthly pay check, courtesy of sweeping tax cuts passed by the Republican Congress late last year.

Marran says the extra cash is nice, but it will not change his life.

House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan , Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch , Senate Republican leadership member John Thune and others expressed hostility to the deal announced on Tuesday by Republican Lamar Alexander and Democrat Patty Murray . It was uncertain if it would ever come to a vote in a Congress controlled by Trump ’ s fellow Republicans .
The agreement would shore up Obamacare by reviving billions of dollars of federal subsidies to insurers for two years to help lower-income Americans obtain medical coverage .
Alexander said on Wednesday that Trump had “ completely engineered ” the bipartisan proposal , but the president backed away from support he had expressed a day earlier .
On Tuesday , Trump said the White House was involved in the negotiations and that the agreement was “ a very good solution ” for a short-term approach , but said on Wednesday he could “ never support bailing out ” insurance companies .
Trump has cut off subsidies to the companies , saying Congress has not provided money for them and that they enrich insurers .
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump did not support the deal in its current form , although she called it “ a good step in the right direction . ”
“ Look , we ’ ve said all along that we want something that doesn ’ t just bail out the insurance companies but actually provides relief for all Americans , ” she said at a briefing . “ And this bill doesn ’ t address that fact . ”

The confusion among lawmakers in both parties over Trump ’ s position on the healthcare deal and the lack of trust some of them have in the president come as Congress is entering a crucial period when important bills on federal spending , the U.S. debt limit and tax cuts are due for consideration .
Thune said the agreement might have “ stalled out ” and that its future was an “ open question. ” Republicans have a 52-48 Senate majority , but other than Alexander only a few have publicly embraced the plan , including Senators John McCain , Susan Collins , Lisa Murkowski , Mike Rounds and Bob Corker .
“ No way to pay for it , ” Hatch said . “ Oh my gosh , give me a break . I appreciate the innovation and the attempt to do it right . But it doesn ’ t help . ”
Trump , who campaigned on a promise to get rid of Obamacare but has been frustrated by the failure of Republicans in Congress to pass legislation to do so , also made clear he wanted broader legislation to repeal and replace the law .
“ Lamar Alexander ’ s working on it very hard from our side . And if something can happen , that ’ s fine , ” Trump told reporters at the White House . “ But I won ’ t do anything to enrich the insurance companies . ... They ’ ve been enriched by Obamacare like nothing anybody ’ s ever seen before . ”
Insurers say they do not profit from the subsidies under the Affordable Care Act , former Democratic President Barack Obama ’ s signature legislative achievement dubbed Obamacare , but pass them on directly to consumers to reduce deductibles , co-payments and other out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income people .
Ending the subsidies , which are called cost-sharing reduction payments , could create chaos in the 2018 health insurance markets set up under Obamacare .

Some leading insurers , including UnitedHealth Group , Aetna Inc and Humana Inc , have largely exited those markets , citing financial losses . Others including Anthem Inc have significantly reduced their presence in the state-based markets .
Ryan gave no indication of willingness to consider the Alexander-Murray agreement . “ The speaker does not see anything that changes his view that the Senate should keep its focus on repeal and replace of Obamacare , ” Ryan spokesman Doug Andres said .
The proposal drew broad Democratic support . Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer ripped Trump for his shifting stances on the Alexander-Murray deal .
“ This president can not govern if , whenever the hard right frightens him and says : ‘ Jump , ’ he says : “ How high ? ’ ” Schumer told reporters .
“ The president is pointing fingers , ” Schumer said . “ He blames ( Senate Majority Leader ) Mitch McConnell for obstruction . He blames the Democrats for obstruction . He ’ s the obstructionist in chief because he can not stick to a position . ”
The proposal would meet some Democratic objectives , such as reviving subsidies for Obamacare and restoring $ 106 million in funding for a federal program that helps people enroll in insurance plans .
In exchange , Republicans would get more flexibility for states to offer a wider variety of health insurance plans while maintaining the requirement that sick and healthy people be charged the same rates for coverage .
Democratic attorneys general from 18 states and the District of Columbia who have filed a legal challenge to the subsidy cutoff asked a judge in California to direct the administration by Thursday to continue the payments . At a hearing on Wednesday , U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco said he would likely rule on the states ’ request next week .
Murray , speaking to ███ on Wednesday , said her agreement with Alexander was still very much alive .

“No way to pay for it,” Hatch said. “Oh my gosh, give me a break. I appreciate the innovation and the attempt to do it right. But it doesn’t help.”

Trump, who campaigned on a promise to get rid of Obamacare but has been frustrated by the failure of Republicans in Congress to pass legislation to do so, also made clear he wanted broader legislation to repeal and replace the law.

“Lamar Alexander’s working on it very hard from our side. And if something can happen, that’s fine,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “But I won’t do anything to enrich the insurance companies. ... They’ve been enriched by Obamacare like nothing anybody’s ever seen before.”

Insurers say they do not profit from the subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature legislative achievement dubbed Obamacare, but pass them on directly to consumers to reduce deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income people.

Ending the subsidies, which are called cost-sharing reduction payments, could create chaos in the 2018 health insurance markets set up under Obamacare.

Some leading insurers, including UnitedHealth Group, Aetna Inc and Humana Inc, have largely exited those markets, citing financial losses. Others including Anthem Inc have significantly reduced their presence in the state-based markets.

Ryan gave no indication of willingness to consider the Alexander-Murray agreement. “The speaker does not see anything that changes his view that the Senate should keep its focus on repeal and replace of Obamacare,” Ryan spokesman Doug Andres said.

‘HOW HIGH?’

The proposal drew broad Democratic support. Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer ripped Trump for his shifting stances on the Alexander-Murray deal.

“This president cannot govern if, whenever the hard right frightens him and says: ‘Jump,’ he says: “How high?’” Schumer told reporters.

“The president is pointing fingers,” Schumer said. “He blames (Senate Majority Leader) Mitch McConnell for obstruction. He blames the Democrats for obstruction. He’s the obstructionist in chief because he cannot stick to a position.”

The proposal would meet some Democratic objectives, such as reviving subsidies for Obamacare and restoring $106 million in funding for a federal program that helps people enroll in insurance plans.

In exchange, Republicans would get more flexibility for states to offer a wider variety of health insurance plans while maintaining the requirement that sick and healthy people be charged the same rates for coverage.

Democratic attorneys general from 18 states and the District of Columbia who have filed a legal challenge to the subsidy cutoff asked a judge in California to direct the administration by Thursday to continue the payments. At a hearing on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco said he would likely rule on the states’ request next week.

Murray, speaking to Reuters on Wednesday, said her agreement with Alexander was still very much alive.

“Absolutely,” Murray said. “Lamar and I are working to have a good set of co-sponsors,” and hope to formally introduce it as a Senate bill on Thursday.",www.reuters.com,center,pnuP6UWadxB36Yj5

The sweeping tax bill that passed the House with only Republican votes on Thursday will cut what Uncle Sam collects in taxes by $1.5 trillion over the coming decade. But while some taxpayers come out as clear winners, others are losers, even within income groups.

For those making $50,000 to $75,000 in 2023, for example, the Joint Committee on Taxation said 36% would get a tax break of $500 or more and another 19% would get a break of $100-$500. But 19% would pay about the same as they do now, 11% would pay $100-$500 more, and 15% would pay an extra $500 or more.

Here's a look at some of the impacts:

Winners

Heirs and heiresses: The bill raises from $5.5 million to $10 million the exemption in the estate tax next year, so estates worth less than that would not be taxed. The tax is repealed entirely in six years. This change amounts to 10% of the lost revenue, or $151 billion over the coming decade.

Corporations: The top tax rate would drop from 35% to 20% on Jan. 1. New equipment could be written off immediately, rather than amortized over several years. And companies could continue to deduct state and local taxes.

Retirement savers: The House had considered cutting the tax benefits of saving in 401(k) and IRA accounts, but decided against it.

Retailers: A tax plan House Republicans campaigned on last year called for a ""border adjustment tax"" on imported goods, but retailers funded an effective campaign portraying it as a price increase on consumer goods and kept it out of the final bill.

Shareholders: The bill's supporters believe corporations will use tax relief to buy equipment and expand, but economists also say much of the bonus will be paid out as dividends that enrich stockholders, including pension funds. Wall Street apparently expects this windfall — stock prices dropped last week after news broke that the Senate would postpone the corporate cut by one year.

Low- and moderate-income taxpayers with children and no deductions: They avoid any losses from the bill's elimination of deductions and credits, and would benefit from the increase in the standard deduction from $12,700 this year to $24,400 next year. An increase in the child tax credit from $1,000 to $1,600, and a new credit of $300 each for a taxpayer, spouse and non-child dependent — like a parent — would offset the elimination of personal exemptions, which this year are worth $4,050 each.

Losers

The sick: The bill eliminates a deduction for medical and dental expenses that exceed 7.5% of their incomes. In 2015, there were 8.8 million taxpayers who deducted $87 million.

Disaster or fire victims: The deduction for losses from fire, flood or disaster that exceed 10% would be eliminated, except for losses covered by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria that were covered by a separate law passed this year.

Vacation communities: The bill eliminates the deduction for mortgage interest on second homes. That would make it more expensive to own such a home.

Residents of high-tax regions: Wealthy states such as New Jersey, New York and California as well as pockets of suburbs around the country could find that the loss of deductions eliminate any benefit from lower tax rates. The bill eliminates the deduction for state income taxes, caps the property tax deduction at $10,000, and on new mortgages, only allows a deduction for interest on the first $500,000 borrowed.

College students: Student loan interest would no longer be deductible. And many universities offer free tuition and a stipend to graduate students who work as teachers or researchers. Currently, only the stipend is taxable, but the would make the tuition a taxable benefit too.

Future generations: The $1.5 trillion reduction in revenues will cause some economic growth, but no study has yet shown it would pay for itself. That means it would most likely add to the deficit — which was $666 billion last year — unless the government makes major spending cuts, which have not been proposed.

Republicans who control the U.S. House of Representatives will not reveal their bill until Wednesday . But the National Association of Home Builders , a powerful housing industry trade group , is already vowing to defeat it over a change that could affect the use of home mortgage deductions , while Republican leaders try to head off opposition to possible changes to individual retirement savings and state and local tax payments .
Trump and Republicans have vowed to enact tax reform this year for the first time since 1986 . But the plan to deliver up to $ 6 trillion in tax cuts for businesses and individuals faces challenges even from rank-and-file House Republicans .

Analysts say there is a good chance the tax overhaul will be delayed until next year .
The NAHB , which boasts 130,000 member firms employing 9 million workers , says the bill would harm U.S. home prices by marginalizing the value of mortgage interest deductions as an incentive for buying homes . The trade group wants legislation to offer a tax credit equaling 12 percent of mortgage interest and property tax payments but says it was rebuffed by House Republican leaders .
“ We ’ re opposed to the tax bill without the tax credit in there , and we ’ ll be working very aggressively to see it defeated , ” NAHB chief executive Jerry Howard told ███ .
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady , the top House Republican on tax policy , suggested in a statement that the NAHB credit could still be included , saying : “ I hope members of Congress will examine it closely to determine if they want it included . ”
Republicans warned that the Trump tax plan is entering a new and difficult phase as lobbyists ramp up pressure on lawmakers to spare their pet tax breaks .
“ When groups start rallying against things and they succeed , everything starts unraveling , ” Senator Bob Corker , a leading Republican fiscal hawk , told CBS ’ Face the Nation .
One of the biggest challenges involves a proposal to eliminate the federal deduction for state and local taxes ( SALT ) , which analysts say would hit upper middle-class families in high income tax states such as New York , New Jersey and California . The states are home to enough House Republicans to stymie legislation .
Brady gave ground over the weekend , saying he would allow a deduction for some local taxes to remain .
“ We are restoring an itemized property tax deduction to help taxpayers with local tax burdens , ” Brady said in another statement .
But the gesture appeared to do little to turn the tide of opposition to SALT ’ s elimination .
“ I ’ m not going to sign onto anything until the full package is fully analyzed by economists , ” Representative Peter King of New York told the Fox News program Sunday Morning Futures .
“ The fact that we ’ re getting it at the eleventh hour raises real issues with me , ” he added .
A lobby coalition representing state and local governments , realtors and public unions rejected Brady ’ s statement outright , saying the move would “ unfairly penalize taxpayers in states that rely significantly on income taxes . ”
House Republicans have also faced opposition from Trump and others after proposing to sharply curtail tax-free contributions to 401 ( k ) programs and move retirement savings to a style of account that allows tax-free withdrawals , rather than the tax-exempt contributions that are popular with 401 ( k ) investors .
House Republicans now say they could permit higher 401 ( k ) contribution limits but continue to talk about tax-free withdrawals . “ We will expand the amount that you can invest . But we ’ ll also give you an option to actually not be taxed later in life , ” House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy told Fox News .
The current cap on annual 401 ( k ) tax-free contributions is $ 18,000 .
Corker said congressional tax committees seem to be falling short of their goal to eliminate $ 4 trillion in tax breaks to prevent the Trump plan from adding to the federal deficit .
“ They ’ re having great difficulty just getting to $ 3.6 trillion , ” said the Tennessee Republican , who has vowed to vote against tax reform if it increases a federal debt load that stands at more than $ 20 trillion .
Ohio ’ s Republican governor , John Kasich , told Fox News Sunday that spending on entitlement programs such as Medicare , Medicaid and Social Security should also be reviewed as part of the effort to pay for tax cuts .
“ It may be separate from the tax bill , but it needs to happen , ” Kasich said .","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s plan for overhauling the U.S. tax system faced growing opposition from interest groups on Sunday, as Republicans prepare to unveil sweeping legislation that could eliminate some of the most popular tax breaks to help pay for lower taxes.

The states are home to enough House Republicans to stymie legislation.

Brady gave ground over the weekend, saying he would allow a deduction for some local taxes to remain.

“We are restoring an itemized property tax deduction to help taxpayers with local tax burdens,” Brady said in another statement.

But the gesture appeared to do little to turn the tide of opposition to SALT’s elimination.

“I’m not going to sign onto anything until the full package is fully analyzed by economists,” Representative Peter King of New York told the Fox News program Sunday Morning Futures.

“The fact that we’re getting it at the eleventh hour raises real issues with me,” he added.

A lobby coalition representing state and local governments, realtors and public unions rejected Brady’s statement outright, saying the move would “unfairly penalize taxpayers in states that rely significantly on income taxes.”

House Republicans have also faced opposition from Trump and others after proposing to sharply curtail tax-free contributions to 401(k) programs and move retirement savings to a style of account that allows tax-free withdrawals, rather than the tax-exempt contributions that are popular with 401(k) investors.

House Republicans now say they could permit higher 401(k) contribution limits but continue to talk about tax-free withdrawals. “We will expand the amount that you can invest. But we’ll also give you an option to actually not be taxed later in life,” House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy told Fox News.

The current cap on annual 401(k) tax-free contributions is $18,000.

Corker said congressional tax committees seem to be falling short of their goal to eliminate $4 trillion in tax breaks to prevent the Trump plan from adding to the federal deficit.

“They’re having great difficulty just getting to $3.6 trillion,” said the Tennessee Republican, who has vowed to vote against tax reform if it increases a federal debt load that stands at more than $20 trillion.

Ohio’s Republican governor, John Kasich, told Fox News Sunday that spending on entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security should also be reviewed as part of the effort to pay for tax cuts.

“It may be separate from the tax bill, but it needs to happen,” Kasich said.",www.reuters.com,center,wmccTjGA1duhz8ju

Those are the numbers of the Joint Committee on Taxation , Congress ’ s official arbiter of tax figures , but skeptics like the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget have argued that the true cost is substantially higher . If the many temporary provisions of the bill are made permanent ( and Republican senators have insisted they will make them permanent ) , the true cost is more like $ 1.6 trillion to $ 2 trillion , and it continues to mount after 10 years are up .
That bill has to be paid for , somehow . Congress could keep rolling over the debt , yes , but historical experience suggests that tax cuts are typically paid for by tax hikes in the future . Republicans have suggested they want to finance the cuts by slashing entitlement programs like Social Security , Medicare , and food stamps . “ We 're going to have to get back next year at entitlement reform , which is how you tackle the debt and the deficit , ” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a radio interview on Wednesday .
Whether you pay for the $ 1.5 trillion through tax hikes or spending cuts , that financing changes who ultimately wins and loses under the bill . And a new study by the Tax Policy Center suggests that when you take financing into account , the vast majority of Americans lose out .
When the bill is paid for , it winds up hurting most Americans
Republicans haven ’ t put out any specifics about the Social Security , Medicare , and other spending cuts they want to use to reduce the deficit . So TPC 's William Gale , Surachai Khitatrakun , and Aaron Krupkin present a number of options for how the burden of the spending cuts could be distributed :
Spending could be cut for every household equally . In 2019 , paying for the tax cuts in the Senate bill would cost $ 1,210 per household . This option assumes that federal spending is cut in such a way that the burden is literally equally distributed , with every household receiving $ 1,210 less benefit from government spending in 2018 . Spending could be cut so that the burden is proportional to a household 's income . Funding the tax cuts would cost , on average , 1.6 percent of each household 's income in 2019 . This option assumes spending cuts that match that : so someone making $ 20,000 a year would see $ 320 less in government spending go their way , while someone making $ 1 million would get $ 16,000 less in spending , and so on . Spending could be cut in a way that ’ s proportional to individuals ' income taxes . Since income taxes are progressive , and many low-income Americans do n't pay them at all , this would entail little or no spending cuts that hurt the poor , and a much heavier concentration of cuts harming the top 1 percent .
I should say that the first of these options is , by far , the most likely . The US doesn ’ t spend a lot of money directly on rich people ; our benefits to the affluent tend to come through the tax code , through provisions like lower rates on capital gains , or through the mortgage interest and charitable deductions . That makes scenario 3 , which assumes massive cuts to spending programs that benefit the rich , a bit fanciful .
More to the point , Republicans ’ efforts to cut spending have focused almost exclusively on programs for the poor , like Medicaid or Supplemental Security Income or food stamps . President Trump ’ s budget proposal includes $ 2.1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid , Affordable Care Act subsidies , food stamps , Social Security Disability Insurance , Supplemental Security Income , and cash welfare ( TANF ) . That would go a long way toward paying for tax cuts , and its impact would be even more concentrated on the poor than in scenario 1 , where spending is cut equally per capita .
Gale , Khitatrakun , and Krupkin find that the overall distributional impact of the tax cuts depends wildly on which of the scenarios they considered occurs . Here ’ s the Senate bill , as financed by a $ 1,210-per-household cut in government spending :
With spending cuts incorporated into the analysis , the bill turns into a rather shocking tax hike on the poor and middle class . The poorest fifth of Americans face an 8.1 percent cut in their income due to loss of government benefits ( likely in the form of programs like food stamps and Medicaid ) . The middle fifth of Americans would be $ 370 worse off per year . The rich , however , and particularly the 95to to 99th percentiles ( households that earn $ 308,200 to $ 746,100 a year ) get substantial tax cuts still , because $ 1,210 just is n't a whole lot next to their overall income .
The TPC also modeled what share of households would gain or lose under this plan :
If the bill is financed this way , 71.6 percent of Americans would be worse off , including 99.9 percent of the poorest Americans . By contrast , large majorities of the richest Americans , in particular the 95th to 99th percentiles , would be better off .
If the cuts are proportional to income ( which , again , I think is a much less plausible modeling scenario than equal per-household spending cuts ) , and every household is 1.6 percent of income worse off due to the financing , then 63.9 percent of Americans wind up with a tax increase , including 93.4 percent of the poorest Americans . That ’ s a little better than the first scenario , but not much .
If the cuts are proportional to income tax burden , and concentrated among the richest Americans who pay the most income taxes , the results are , unsurprisingly , progressive . In that scenario , 65.2 percent of Americans would get a tax cut , while 81 percent of the top 0.1 percent would see a tax hike averaging 3.7 percent of their income , or $ 273,400 a year . I ’ ll leave it to you to judge how likely Republicans are to champion such a plan .
It ’ s common in economic analysis to assume that the long-run budget deficit a government runs is $ 0 . That is , all budget deficits are eventually financed by budget surpluses in the future , and tax cuts that increase the deficit have to eventually be paid for by tax hikes or spending cuts in the future .
But the “ long run ” is very long indeed . The US has historically run budget deficits much more often than it ’ s run surpluses , and the deficits were substantially larger than those rare surpluses as well . Over the span of US history , the country has spent considerably more than it ’ s taxed .
And maybe that ’ s okay . The United States isn ’ t a business whose books need to balance eventually . It ’ s a permanent government that pays its debts in a currency it controls . If its deficits get too big , that can spur high interest rates and inflation , which have a number of negative consequences . But there have been no signs of either of those problems in recent years .
That ’ s led a lot of people , like my colleague Matt Yglesias , to grow skeptical of the idea that deficit-financed policies like tax cuts have to be , in some meaningful sense , “ paid for. ” The Bush tax cuts and the Iraq and Afghanistan wars haven ’ t really been “ paid for ” yet in any way . Maybe the Trump tax cuts will be the same .
That ’ s a fair argument , but it ’ s not one that Republicans in Congress are making . Their claim , instead , is that they ’ re going to enact this massive tax cut and then pivot to cutting spending programs , in particular Social Security , Medicare , Medicaid , and food stamps . In that context , it makes sense to consider what such pay-fors would do to the overall distribution of the tax cuts . And what they do is make the tax cuts extremely regressive , and create net tax hikes on the middle class and poor .","Officially, the tax bill passed by the US Senate in the early morning hours of December 2 costs $1.45 trillion over 10 years, or $1 trillion after taking into account its effect on economic growth.

Those are the numbers of the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress’s official arbiter of tax figures, but skeptics like the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget have argued that the true cost is substantially higher. If the many temporary provisions of the bill are made permanent (and Republican senators have insisted they will make them permanent), the true cost is more like $1.6 trillion to $2 trillion, and it continues to mount after 10 years are up.

That bill has to be paid for, somehow. Congress could keep rolling over the debt, yes, but historical experience suggests that tax cuts are typically paid for by tax hikes in the future. Republicans have suggested they want to finance the cuts by slashing entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and food stamps. “We're going to have to get back next year at entitlement reform, which is how you tackle the debt and the deficit,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a radio interview on Wednesday.

Whether you pay for the $1.5 trillion through tax hikes or spending cuts, that financing changes who ultimately wins and loses under the bill. And a new study by the Tax Policy Center suggests that when you take financing into account, the vast majority of Americans lose out.

When the bill is paid for, it winds up hurting most Americans

Republicans haven’t put out any specifics about the Social Security, Medicare, and other spending cuts they want to use to reduce the deficit. So TPC's William Gale, Surachai Khitatrakun, and Aaron Krupkin present a number of options for how the burden of the spending cuts could be distributed:

Spending could be cut for every household equally. In 2019, paying for the tax cuts in the Senate bill would cost $1,210 per household. This option assumes that federal spending is cut in such a way that the burden is literally equally distributed, with every household receiving $1,210 less benefit from government spending in 2018. Spending could be cut so that the burden is proportional to a household's income. Funding the tax cuts would cost, on average, 1.6 percent of each household's income in 2019. This option assumes spending cuts that match that: so someone making $20,000 a year would see $320 less in government spending go their way, while someone making $1 million would get $16,000 less in spending, and so on. Spending could be cut in a way that’s proportional to individuals' income taxes. Since income taxes are progressive, and many low-income Americans don't pay them at all, this would entail little or no spending cuts that hurt the poor, and a much heavier concentration of cuts harming the top 1 percent.

I should say that the first of these options is, by far, the most likely. The US doesn’t spend a lot of money directly on rich people; our benefits to the affluent tend to come through the tax code, through provisions like lower rates on capital gains, or through the mortgage interest and charitable deductions. That makes scenario 3, which assumes massive cuts to spending programs that benefit the rich, a bit fanciful.

It won’t.,2017-10-04,"Edward Kleinbard, German Lopez, Brian Resnick, Aaron Rupar","Edward Kleinbard analyzed the Republican tax “ framework ” earlier this month . The bill introduced this week contains the elements he discusses , with one caveat : It attempts to constrain taxpayers from converting compensation income into “ pass-through ” income , which would be taxed at a preferential 25 percent rate . ( For instance , an active manager of a pass-through business would be entitled to treat only 30 percent of his share of income from that source as qualifying for the preferential tax rate . ) But it ’ s too soon to know whether those limitations will be effective , or if they will even end up in the final legislation :
To understand the business tax provisions in the Trump tax proposals , begin with F. Scott Fitzgerald ’ s insight that the rich are different from you and me — they have more money .
In particular , they have more capital . ( Ever polite , economists call piles of money that have been invested “ capital. ” ) Business tax reform really is an exercise in how we should tax capital income — that is , returns on investments . And because the rich have lots more capital than do you or I , the benefits of the multitrillion-dollar business tax cuts proposed by the Trump administration ’ s tax “ framework ” necessarily will be vacuumed up by the most affluent Americans . Business tax reform has only a modest connection to the economic future of working stiffs , and the small connection that does exist is a second-order effect .
The Trump framework offers two critical tax cuts for businesses and their owners : First , it reduces the tax rate on corporate income from 35 to 20 percent ; and second , it caps the taxes imposed on owners of “ pass-through ” businesses like partnerships and S corporations , by creating a new 25 percent tax bracket for those owners ’ pass-through income .
( As Republicans never tire of pointing out , regular corporations and their shareholders in theory are subject to double taxation — once when the income is earned by the corporation and again when it ’ s distributed as taxable dividends to individual shareholders . This rule , however , is honored almost exclusively in the breach . By contrast , the owners of “ pass-through ” entities are taxed directly on the income of their pass-throughs . Most privately owned companies are organized as pass-throughs ; virtually all publicly traded companies are taxed as corporations . )
The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates that the changes to corporate and pass-through tax rates , plus some ancillary rules , will slash tax collections by more than $ 2.6 trillion in forgone revenue over the next 10 years . By contrast , the purely individual provisions in the Trump plan are estimated to raise about $ 500 billion in taxes from all of us over the same period . So , viewing things in the aggregate , the overall tax cuts promised by the framework are entirely a story about the business tax side of things : The individual side is a net tax hike . More particularly , the overall impact of the tax framework is a story about who benefits from business tax cuts .
Mitt Romney was right when he said that corporations don ’ t pay taxes — people do . You ’ ve never seen a corporation walking down the sidewalk , because it ’ s a legal fiction . In the end , one group of people or another shoulders the burden of the corporate tax , or in this case enjoys the benefits of slashing the rate to 20 percent . But which people ?
President Trump and other apologists for the Republican plan insist that they ’ re not in it for the money for themselves , but are simply the selfless servants of the average worker . They argue that a lower corporate rate translates directly into higher wages . Now , it is true that one can construct simple models that imply such a result , but the reason they do is that within these models , a high corporate tax chases capital investment away from the United States to lower-taxed countries , so that capital can enjoy higher after-tax returns , leaving less capital behind invested in the productivity of each American worker .
These models do not apply to the modern American multinational corporation , as several studies have found . For that reason , the US Treasury in recent years has assumed that 82 percent of the burden of the corporate tax ( or the benefit of a corporate tax rate cut ) falls on the shoulders of owners of capital , not working Joes , and the leading nonpartisan economic institutions and analysts Congress relies on ( namely the Congressional Budget Office and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation ) employ similar rules of thumb .
In fact , the Treasury economists ’ careful work here is so damning to the framework ’ s enterprise that the political bosses at Treasury have ordered the study removed from its website .
Even within the small fraction thought to fall on labor , these agencies conclude that labor bears its share of the corporate tax in proportion to incomes . So top executives , with their outsize compensation , would get the lion ’ s share of any portion of a corporate tax cut attributable to labor .
As it happens , there is good reason to reduce the corporate tax rate . But that ’ s principally because the full 35 percent rate applies so unevenly and to relatively few corporations . One sophisticated study concluded that the average tax rate actually paid by US corporations ( their “ effective ” tax rate ) was about 23 percent — or 32 percent if one pretended that all corporate income was immediately distributed as dividends . And when it comes to US multinationals , the results are even more skewed , due to what I ’ ve dubbed their “ stateless income ” shenanigans . Microsoft , for example , announced to shareholders that in 2016 , its US operations lost $ 325 million .
Fortunately , it booked $ 20 billion in profits outside the United States ! A close examination of its tax footnote in its financials reveals that its foreign earnings bear an effective foreign tax rate of around 5 percent . As even the tax framework acknowledges , tax reform here will be all about imposing a minimum tax as a floor on companies ’ stateless income planning .
We find ourselves back at the central question . To understand who benefits from business tax rate cuts , we need to ask : Who owns capital in America ? Unlike many other tax imponderables , we actually know a lot about this .
Capital income is much more concentrated , in fact , than is overall income : The top 1 percent captures about 21 percent of overall income in the United States ( itself quite extraordinary ) but double that proportion of capital income . What ’ s more , capital ownership in the United States is extraordinarily concentrated at the very top of the top end : Those with wealth exceeding $ 20 million ( the top one-thousandth , or 0.1 percent ) own as much as do the bottom 90 percent .
Despite GOP claims , the new rate on “ pass-through ” entities won ’ t do much for small businesses
The overall lesson is plain : The average line worker is not the principal beneficiary of corporate rate reduction . Nor , we can safely say , is Ma and Pa Kettle ’ s Muffler Shop the prototypical pass-through business that will benefit from the 25 percent rate cap on pass-through income .
Taxpayers who receive income from pass-throughs pay at the individual rate . The framework ’ s proposal for special tax treatment for pass-throughs is being pitched as something that will help small businesses , but it confuses small businesses with pass-through businesses . The real advantages will flow to large pass-throughs and the most affluent investors . The top 1 percent of Americans earn 69 percent of all pass-through income ; they are the ones who will garner the benefits of the preferential pass-through rate .
Genuinely small businesses aren ’ t the object here , given that without the special deal incomes , up to $ 233,000 ( married filing jointly ) would be taxed at 25 percent simply by virtue of the new tax brackets . And , as it happens , the average tax rate imposed on pass-throughs today is around 19 percent , making the case for providing a 25 percent ceiling on pass-through tax rates even tougher to see .
Lower pass-through rates will also redirect energy away from business productivity into creative tax accounting . Lawyers go to work to shoehorn back into the 25 percent preferential rate whatever income Congress purports to exclude from it .
Meanwhile , owner-entrepreneurs will be induced to engage in what I call “ labor stuffing. ” Instead of paying herself a salary , the owner-entrepreneur will extract her share of her firm ’ s earnings in the form of business income , thereby masquerading labor income as qualifying capital income . I ’ ve spent an enormous amount of time working on this problem in a related context , and have proposed a technical solution ( short version here ) . The “ Big Six ” lawmakers who drafted the framework have done no work to address this .
But what about growth ? Surely the Tax Policy Center ’ s $ 2.6 trillion deficit-ballooning estimate for the cost of the plan ’ s business tax gifts will lead to faster growth that will make all of us better off , and offset the apparent cost of the framework to boot ? Would that it were so , but responsible economists agree that this is just not true , whether one looks to history ( most recently , Kansas ) or theory . The idea that the growth fairy can be propitiated only through tax cuts is faith-based economics .
The tax framework will produce a multitrillion-dollar increase in our deficits by forgoing tax revenues in order to cut taxes on the very must affluent . This spurt in deficits will impede , not accelerate , growth , by increasing the interest rates paid by US businesses . It also will make our ability to respond to the next recession that much more precarious .
Look at it this way : When interest rates are still near their lowest levels in decades , and banks are lending , where is the evidence that firms right now are facing difficulty in finding the capital to invest in attractive opportunities ? There is none . In fact , the framework ’ s combination of expensing business investments and permitting at least some interest deductions would reduce the effective ( real-life ) tax rates on those investments below zero , which means that we all would be subsidizing firms in replacing American workers by machines .
Finally , it might be suggested that only envy can explain my preoccupation — and that of other commentators — with how generous the framework ’ s business tax cuts are to the most affluent Americans . So long as low- and middle-income taxpayers are also better off , who cares about the largesse at the top ? The answers are , first , millions of ordinary Americans in fact will be worse off — as the Tax Policy Center ’ s preliminary analysis makes clear .
And second , we all have a vital interest in the financial stability of the United States . The tax framework will produce a multitrillion-dollar increase in our deficits by forgoing tax revenues in order to cut taxes on the very must affluent . This spurt in deficits will impede , not accelerate , growth , by increasing the interest rates paid by US businesses . It also will make our ability to respond to the next recession that much more precarious . So , yes , in this case , all of us have a vital interest in not giving away the store to some of us .
To paraphrase Fitzgerald , the ownership of business capital and business capital income is what distinguishes the rich from you and me , and for this reason , the lion ’ s share of the Trump framework ’ s multitrillion-dollar business tax cuts can not help but be captured by the most affluent Americans . This is a tax proposal only Jay Gatsby could love .
Edward D. Kleinbard is the Robert C. Packard trustee chair in law at the USC Gould School of Law and the author of We Are Better Than This : How Government Should Spend Our Money . He is a former chief of staff of the US Congress 's Joint Committee on Taxation .","Edward Kleinbard analyzed the Republican tax “framework” earlier this month. The bill introduced this week contains the elements he discusses, with one caveat: It attempts to constrain taxpayers from converting compensation income into “pass-through” income, which would be taxed at a preferential 25 percent rate. (For instance, an active manager of a pass-through business would be entitled to treat only 30 percent of his share of income from that source as qualifying for the preferential tax rate.) But it’s too soon to know whether those limitations will be effective, or if they will even end up in the final legislation:

To understand the business tax provisions in the Trump tax proposals, begin with F. Scott Fitzgerald’s insight that the rich are different from you and me — they have more money.

In particular, they have more capital. (Ever polite, economists call piles of money that have been invested “capital.”) Business tax reform really is an exercise in how we should tax capital income — that is, returns on investments. And because the rich have lots more capital than do you or I, the benefits of the multitrillion-dollar business tax cuts proposed by the Trump administration’s tax “framework” necessarily will be vacuumed up by the most affluent Americans.

So, viewing things in the aggregate, the overall tax cuts promised by the framework are entirely a story about the business tax side of things: The individual side is a net tax hike. More particularly, the overall impact of the tax framework is a story about who benefits from business tax cuts.

Corporate tax cuts fall on real people. Which ones?

Mitt Romney was right when he said that corporations don’t pay taxes — people do. You’ve never seen a corporation walking down the sidewalk, because it’s a legal fiction. In the end, one group of people or another shoulders the burden of the corporate tax, or in this case enjoys the benefits of slashing the rate to 20 percent. But which people?

Republican senators were spotted walking in and out of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-Ky.) office throughout the week to discuss their priorities for tax reform.

They also shared their concerns and preferences with President Trump when he sat down with them for lunch on Tuesday.

Sen. Deb Fischer Debra (Deb) Strobel FischerStatue of Chief Standing Bear to be unveiled in Capitol The 23 Republicans who opposed Trump-backed budget deal Landmark US-Russia arms control treaty poised for final blow MORE (R-Neb.) told the president the legislation must clearly provide tax relief for the middle class and Trump agreed.

Democrats have criticized the GOP plan by arguing that it would cause taxes for a third of middle-income families to increase.

A senior GOP aide dismissed concerns that the legislation is moving too quickly and that some lawmakers might feel jammed, like they were during the health-care debate when the bill crafted by leadership was kept secret until shortly before a floor vote.

The aide noted that members of the Senate Budget Committee received a briefing from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Steven Terner MnuchinHillicon Valley: Treasury sanctions Russians over 2018 election meddling | How Facebook fought back on FTC fine | WeWork calls off IPO | Elon Musk unveils Mars rocket US sanctions Russian individuals for interference in 2018 elections Trump seeks to shift questions from impeachment at UN MORE and White House economic adviser Gary Cohn last month and that senior administration officials have been in regular contact with the Finance Committee for months.

A second Senate GOP aide said the Senate bill will “reflect the goals” outlined in the tax framework that administration officials and congressional leaders released last month but will also “reflect the desires” of lawmakers who are working to fill in its details.

Cohn was back on the Hill this week meeting with members of the bipsartisan Problem Solvers Caucus on how to solve the SALT conundrum. During that meeting, Dent returned to the idea of tying a major infrastructure package to tax reform, a sweetener to help bring moderates along.

A source in the room described Cohn as “receptive” to the idea.

But in internal deliberations, Ryan and his leadership team have quashed the idea of merging the two policy issues, sources said, arguing it would further complicate and delay an already challenging piece of legislation.

“When you try to cultivate 218 votes in the House and 50 votes in the Senate, there’s gonna be a lot of negotiation,” said Rep. Jason Smith (R-Mo.), a member of Ryan’s leadership team who also serves on the powerful Ways and Means Committee, which is writing the tax bill.

“When you’re looking at the tax code itself, it’s 70,000 pages; that’s very complex. You touch one thing, it affects 100 other things, so it’s too complex” to do both tax reform and infrastructure in the same bill.

Freshman Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, called a joint tax reform and infrastructure bill “a bad idea.”

“Tax reform is a very complex issue. Infrastructure needs and funding for it is a complex issue. We can barely get one complex issue done at a time,” Biggs told The Hill. “Sticking another complex issue right on top of it is a bad idea.”

That question is critical , because Ocasio-Cortez isn ’ t proposing federal spending for its own sake .

taxes,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jul/9/obama-congress-extend-bush-tax-cuts-middle-class/,Obama to Congress: Extend Bush tax cuts for the middle class ,2012-07-09,Susan Crabtree,"In an attempt to change the subject from the dismal jobs market and cast GOP rival Mitt Romney as a champion of the rich , President Obama on Monday issued a new call for Congress to extend the Bush tax cuts for the middle class and allow rates to rise on wealthier income earners .
The president , in an address from the White House , called for a one-year extension of tax cuts for households making less than $ 250,000 a year .
Mr. Romney and Republicans in Congress would like to extend all the Bush tax cuts , set to expire at the end of the year for the middle class as well as higher earners , before they tackle a comprehensive overhaul of the tax code early next year .
“ We should not raise taxes on the middle class and small businesses at a time when the recovery is still fragile , ” Mr. Obama said , appearing in the East Room with families and workers who would benefit from the continued tax breaks . “ That ’ s why I ’ m calling on Congress to extend the tax cuts for the 98 percent of Americans who make less than $ 250,000 for another year . ”
If Congress doesn ’ t extend the tax cuts , he said , millions of American families could see their taxes go up by $ 2,200 a year . “ It would be a big blow to working families , and it would be a drag on our entire economy , ” he said .
The White House is trying to force the GOP ’ s hand or face the consequences of appearing as if they are supporting the wealthy over middle-class Americans struggling in a bad economy . The House GOP is planning a vote later this month on a bill that would extend all of the Bush tax cuts , lay out details of their principles for tax reform and include expedited procedures for the consideration of a tax-code overhaul in 2013 .
Mr. Romney supports the House Republican plan while Mr. Obama has repeatedly called for wealthy Americans to pay more in taxes .
“ While I disagree on extending tax cuts for the wealthy because we just can ’ t afford them , we all say that we should extend tax cuts for 98 percent of the American people , ” Mr. Obama said . “ Let ’ s agree to do what we agree on , right ? ”
The Bush tax cuts — approved during the first term of George W. Bush and extended by Mr. Obama and Congress in 2010 — are due to expire at the end of the year . Economists worry that the tax cuts , combined with the automatic across-the-board spending cuts set to take place unless Congress finds offsets , would amount to a one-two punch to the already shaky U.S. economy .
The president ’ s renewed push follows Friday ’ s jobless numbers showing unemployment stagnant at 8.2 percent — a disappointing report that rattled the Obama campaign and gave Mr. Romney an opening to argue that he offers an alternative road map for the economy .
Outside observers view Mr. Obama ’ s Monday statement from the White House as a transparent attempt to change the subject from Friday ’ s sobering jobs report .
David Rohde , a professor of political science at Duke University , said presidents have a limited ability to affect the public ’ s thoughts on what issues are important , but Mr. Obama is doing what he can .
“ Obama can not make people forget that the economy is not recovering as quickly as they want , but he may be able to get them to think that other issues are also important , ” he said . “ Tax fairness is one of those additional issues . It is also an issue that can help him to motivate the Democratic base . ”
The Romney campaign countered the president ’ s middle-class tax-extension photo op by pointing out that Mr. Obama ’ s proposal amounts to a “ massive tax increase ” and said it just proves that the president “ doesn ’ t have a clue how to get America working again and help the middle class . ”
“ The president ’ s latest bad idea is to raise taxes on families , job creators and small business , ” said Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul . “ Unlike President Obama , Gov . Romney understands that the last thing we need to do in this economy is to raise taxes on anyone . ”
Congressional Republicans also argued that the president ’ s approach would harm small-business owners .
“ President Obama is still asleep at the switch when it comes to our economy and jobs , ” said House Speaker John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican . “ In the wake of another weak jobs report , the president is doubling down on his quixotic call for the same small-business tax hikes that have been routinely rejected by the House and Senate . ”
But Mr. Obama argued that 97 percent of small businesses , as well as 98 percent of the public , would fall under the $ 250,000 marker . White House spokesman Jay Carney later said the 3 percent of small businesses that would be subject to the new tax are made up of lawyers , lobbyists and hedge-fund managers who call themselves small businesses when they file articles of incorporation .
After Mr. Carney ’ s remarks , the GOP-controlled House Small Business Committee circulated quotes from several small-business owners lamenting the impact the tax increases would have on them .
Cliff Laverty , who owns Total Radio Inc. , a wireless Motorola dealer in Tulsa , Okla. , said his company would fall into the $ 250,000-and-above category because the company is organized as a Chapter S small-business corporation and the business profits pass through to the owners ’ personal income .
“ President Obama ’ s proposal is going to negatively impact our ability to reinvest and grow our business , ” Mr. Laverty said .
More generally , Republicans argue that Mr. Obama ’ s push for increasing taxes for the wealthy defies earlier assertions he made on the subject . The Republican National Committee pointed to Mr. Obama ’ s comments in August 2009 when asked about raising taxes .
“ The last thing you want to do is raise taxes in the middle of a recession , ” Mr. Obama told NBC at the time .
Mr. Obama ” s use of his bully pulpit to push for middle-class tax cuts coincides with Democrats ’ new , multipronged attack on Mr. Romney ’ s personal finances , including calls to explain his offshore bank accounts and release additional tax returns .
As the Obama campaign has stepped up attacks on Mr. Romney ’ s personal fortune , estimated at $ 250 million or more , Team Romney has pushed back .
Last week , when asked whether he should be vacationing at his lakeside house in New Hampshire while other Americans are struggling , Mr. Romney said all Americans deserve a vacation and , if elected , he would work to get the economy moving again so that all Americans could enjoy one .
Over the weekend , Mr. Romney held a $ 50,000-per-person fundraiser Sunday in the Hamptons , New York ’ s enclave of wealthy waterfront homes on Long Island ’ s South Shore . On Monday morning , Romney aides reported that the campaign and the Republican National Committee raised a combined $ 106 million in June , their biggest one-month fundraising draw of the election so far .
