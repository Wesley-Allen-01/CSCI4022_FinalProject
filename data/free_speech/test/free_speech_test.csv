How Portland 's liberal utopia became the center of a rightwing war in the US
During the Obama years , Portland was widely seen as a redoubt of crunchy , progressive , west coast liberalism . Much of the world saw the city through the lens of Portlandia , a TV sketch show that lampooned hipsters , cyclists and fussy diners . The city was viewed as a liberal , cultural centre of the US – and a sharp contrast with more traditional conservative parts of the country . Its laid-back image was frequently satirised , not least by the comedian Fred Armisen , who said : “ It ’ s where young people go to retire . ”
Portlandia was more a caricature than a portrait , and locals noted what it left out – rapid gentrification and displacement , increasing homelessness , the contentious policing of the Portland police bureau ( PPB ) and the long racist history in the Pacific north-west that made Portland the whitest major city in America . The former NBA player Greg Oden said of his time playing in Portland : “ It isn ’ t a great city to live in if you ’ re a young African American male with a lot of money . ”

This weekend will see the latest in a long line of far-right gatherings that have plagued the city over the last few years . Various groups , including the most visible , the Proud Boys , will descend on the downtown area . Once again they will be met by leftist counter-protesters . And once again , PPB will be under heavy scrutiny for the way in which they police the event .
But how did Portland , for so long considered a bastion of American liberalism , become the centre of the country ’ s battle between left and right ?
Ask Portland ’ s mayor , Ted Wheeler , what happened to the city ’ s brewpubs-and-bikes image , and he will say that behind the headlines and images of political street fighting , that city still exists .
“ I would say Portland has not changed . The impression that people get these days is that everywhere you go in Portland violence is breaking out all over the place . That couldn ’ t be further from the truth . ”
Since the 2016 election , the national spotlight has frequently been on Portland during bouts of political violence : a double murder linked to white supremacy in 2017 , riots downtown pitting far-right groups against anti-fascists , and instances of heavy-handed policing which have left city residents bloodied and traumatized .
Portland , like most west coast cities , is deeply Democratic in its politics , and it has long been home to more radical left currents . And the Portlandia image has some basis in truth – the city has developed a diverse service economy notable for its craft breweries , cafes , restaurants and artisanal goods .
But the Oregon hinterland is deeply conservative , and Portland itself has long been a target for far-right organising . In the 1980s and 1990s , neo-Nazi skinheads converged in the streets , and a gang killed an Ethiopian immigrant , Mulugeta Seraw , in 1988 .
A number of far-right groups have placed themselves at the center of more recent events . One , Patriot Prayer , is led by Joey Gibson , who lives across the Columbia river in Vancouver , Washington . Gibson has organized about 18 rallies in Portland since 2017 , some of which have degenerated into violence .
On Thursday , Gibson became the fifth person arrested in just over a week as a result of a raid in May on Cider Riot , a bar popular with the left . He was charged with rioting , a felony .
Last July , Gibson told conspiracy broadcaster Alex Jones : “ Portland is one of the worst cities in this country . It ’ s full of so much darkness . That ’ s why I ’ m so motivated to go there . ”
Every event Gibson has organised in Portland has been met by a counter-protest , and these have generally been far larger than the rightwing crowds . Opposition to the rallies acquired a new impetus in May 2017 , after Jeremy Christian allegedly showered passengers on a commuter train with racial abuse , and then allegedly stabbed three men who came to their aid , killing two . Christian , who has been charged with aggravated murder , had attended a “ free speech ” rally organized by Gibson the previous month draped in an American flag and making fascist salutes .
Local anti-fascist groups , especially Rose City Antifa , have produced photographic evidence that early on Gibson ’ s rallies were attracting local extremists from white nationalist groups .
But it is another group which has become increasingly central to Portland ’ s rightwing protests : the Proud Boys . The “ western chauvinist ” fraternity , established by the Vice co-founder Gavin McInnes in 2015 , has been involved in street violence throughout the US . Trials are ongoing after an incident in New York City last year where 10 members of the group were caught on video beating anti-fascists at the conclusion of a McInnes speech .
The group has been particularly active in the Pacific north-west . They first cooperated with Gibson in the events he organized , until a reported split . Men in Proud Boys colours were closely involved in one of the worst incidents of political street violence in Portland ’ s recent history , in June last year .
This weekend , the Proud Boys are front and center again . The main organizer is Joe Biggs , a combat veteran and former Alex Jones employee who prominently displays the Proud Boys logo on his Facebook page .
Biggs has been banned from many platforms after issuing threats ahead of the rally . In a Periscope video , he warned anti-fascists , or “ antifa ” : “ Every time you turn your shoulder or your head , you look over , you ’ re always gon na feel like myself or someone else is gon na be there looking , because that ’ s what we ’ re going to do . ”
Wheeler , the mayor , laid some of the blame for this far-right resurgence at the feet of Donald Trump .
“ What ’ s happening on the streets of Portland , or what ’ s happening on the streets of any other community in this country , is not removed from the national trend that we ’ re seeing , ” Wheeler said . “ One has to acknowledge that our president has given life to that kind of hostility , that kind of hate speech . ”
But the right seems not to hear it . In recent weeks , the Texas senator Ted Cruz has sparred with Mayor Wheeler on Twitter , and called for federal investigation into the city ’ s handling of protests .
Amid rising white nationalism , Cruz has also proposed a Senate resolution which would designate antifa as a domestic terrorist group . The resolution describes Rose City Antifa as a group that “ explicitly rejects the authority of law enforcement officers in the United States ” .
Harmeet Dhillon , a former editor of the conservative Dartmouth Review , a sometimes lawyer for fired Google engineer James Damore , and the Republican National Committeewoman for California , is promising to sue the city on behalf of Andy Ngo , a conservative writer who was milkshaked and punched by masked protesters at a protest in the city on 29 June .
Ngo ’ s assault initiated a firestorm of outrage in conservative media on its way to becoming a global story . It even attracted the attention of Trump , who mentioned Ngo by name in a speech to a social media summit packed with rightwing internet personalities . Trump also tweeted support of a terrorist designation for antifa .
Zakir Khan , the program manager at the Portland-based progressive not-for-profit the Western States Center , said that the Democratic leadership , including Wheeler , have given rightwing groups an opening .
“ I think that one of the things that these groups look for is vulnerabilities in leadership , ” he said . “ And when these incursions from far-right groups started happening , we didn ’ t see a city , a county , a state-wide response . ”
Wheeler , for his part , said it ’ s not just his or Portland ’ s problem . “ For me , it is so clear that what ’ s at stake here goes well beyond the question of public safety in one municipality in the United States , ” he said .
Like California and Washington , Oregon ’ s politics are dominated by the larger urban centers in the western half of the state .
In rural communities – many of which have experienced decades of economic decline – this breeds resentment . This us-versus-them politics “ allows the possibility that the far right in cities like Portland can begin linking themselves with rural articulations , like the Three Percenters or the Oath Keepers ” , says Joe Lowndes , who teaches political science at the University of Oregon .

Even as Portlandia’s run was ending, a darker picture of the city was being painted, often by outsiders.

This weekend will see the latest in a long line of far-right gatherings that have plagued the city over the last few years. Various groups, including the most visible, the Proud Boys, will descend on the downtown area. Once again they will be met by leftist counter-protesters. And once again, PPB will be under heavy scrutiny for the way in which they police the event.

But how did Portland, for so long considered a bastion of American liberalism, become the centre of the country’s battle between left and right?

Ask Portland’s mayor, Ted Wheeler, what happened to the city’s brewpubs-and-bikes image, and he will say that behind the headlines and images of political street fighting, that city still exists.

“I would say Portland has not changed. The impression that people get these days is that everywhere you go in Portland violence is breaking out all over the place. That couldn’t be further from the truth.”

Then the dominoes started to fall.,2018-08-06,"Aja Romano, Li Zhou, Anna North, Dylan Matthews, Ian Millhiser, Sean Collins","Within the past 24 hours , Apple , Facebook , and YouTube have all joined in summarily banning far-right broadcaster and known conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his Infowars network from their platforms .
The bans have been swift and startling , coming after mounting public backlash against Infowars ’ pernicious rhetoric , which is most notorious for helping popularize the false belief that the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting never happened . Jones is currently the defendant in a precedent-setting lawsuit brought against him by the parents of a Sandy Hook victim .
But the ongoing conversation around the real-life damage Jones and his network have inflicted has also been accompanied by weeks of hedging from major internet companies , including Facebook and Spotify , about how to deal with Jones on their platforms while still protecting free speech .
Initially , Facebook , YouTube , and Spotify all took selective action , banning some episodes of Jones ’ s podcasts and shows or removing selected social media posts they found to be in violation of various policies while allowing Infowars channels to remain active . Last Thursday , the popular audio streaming app Stitcher became the first platform to pull all of Jones ’ s content , without a lot of fuss .
But on Sunday night , Apple followed suit , summarily banning all of Jones ’ s content from iTunes — in the process sending a definitive message about what is and isn ’ t permissible free speech . Almost immediately , the dominoes began to fall : In the hours since Apple took action , multiple sites have started scrambling to reverse positions they were defending just a week ago .
The most notable of these is Facebook , which abruptly about-faced on its own free speech policy just hours after Apple did , essentially in the middle of the night . After that came YouTube , which appeared to ban Jones ’ s channel ( which had more than 2.5 million subscribers as of Monday ) from its platform late Monday morning .

Spotify , which spent last week under fire after it decided to remove only selected episodes of Jones ’ s shows from its streaming platform , has also followed Apple ’ s lead , removing its entire library of Infowars-related media .
The swiftness of these removals highlights a truth that many tech companies don ’ t want to fully acknowledge in an age of increased ideological polarization among their users : The idea of “ protecting free speech ” isn ’ t actually a hard-and-fast policy on their sites , but rather an increasingly handy excuse they can use to avoid taking controversial action .
That ’ s almost certainly why , as soon as Apple took the step of entirely banning Jones and his content , the cudgel fell : All of a sudden , the more controversial action would have been to allow Jones and Infowars to remain . And so sites that just a week ago were tentatively committed to protecting Jones ’ s “ free speech ” couldn ’ t about-face fast enough .

Facebook was the staunchest defender of Jones ’ s right to free speech — until it wasn ’ t
In July , while attending a controversial journalist consortium hosted by Facebook whose participants included multiple far-right publications like the Daily Caller , CNN reporter Oliver Darcy asked Facebook News Feed director John Hegeman “ how the company could claim it was serious about tackling the problem of misinformation online while simultaneously allowing Infowars to maintain a page with nearly one million followers on its website . ”
Hegeman ’ s answer was less than clarifying : “ I guess just for being false that doesn ’ t violate the community standards , ” he said , adding that Infowars had “ not violated something that would result in them being taken down . ”
But the question of Infowars ’ policy violations is not theoretical ; it is a fringe broadcast network that has on multiple occasions propagated conspiracies with appalling real-world effects , from Pizzagate to the false belief that the Sandy Hook shooting was a hoax .
The latter has resulted in multiple parents of Sandy Hook victims being extensively targeted online . Those parents include Lenny Pozner and Veronique De La Rosa , whose 6-year-old son Noah was killed in the attack and who have since had to move seven times in the past five years to escape harassment from Sandy Hook “ truthers ” egged on by the unsupportable fringe rhetoric of Infowars .
Pozner and De La Rosa are behind the aforementioned lawsuit against Jones and Infowars , and its outcome stands to redefine the question of what “ free speech ” is , legally . But in the meantime , the lawsuit has galvanized the public conversation around the damage that Infowars has done — and merged with the ongoing conversation about Facebook ’ s responsibility for combating the spread of fake news .
Facebook invited me to an event today where the company aimed to tout its commitment to fighting fake news and misinformation .
I asked them why InfoWars is still allowed on the platform .
I did n't get a good answer.https : //t.co/WwLgqa6vQ4 — Oliver Darcy ( @ oliverdarcy ) July 12 , 2018
In a July interview , Kara Swisher of Recode — which , like ███ , is owned by ███ Media — asked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg about the mentality behind the company ’ s policy of refusing to ban the presence of properties like Infowars , given its stated commitment to dealing with fake news . In response , Zuckerberg seemed to use the idea of protecting free speech to dance around the ethically blurry line of leaving his platform open to people who could spread harmful fake news and potentially dangerous views :
“ The approach that we ’ ve taken to false news is not to say : You can ’ t say something wrong on the internet , ” Zuckerberg said . “ I think that that would be too extreme . Everyone gets things wrong , and if we were taking down people ’ s accounts when they got a few things wrong , then that would be a hard world for giving people a voice and saying that you care about that . ”
Following this interview , however , backlash mounted over Zuckerberg ’ s comments , which included an attempt to explain why Facebook probably wouldn ’ t ban Holocaust denialism despite its repugnance . In response to criticism of what seemed to be Zuckerberg ’ s nebulous stance , Facebook temporarily suspended Jones himself — that is , his personal Facebook page — as well as four selected videos that the company deemed had violated its community standards .
Facebook ’ s selectiveness seemed to guide the other sites that subsequently took steps toward placing restrictions on Infowars . Both Spotify and YouTube chose to allow Jones ’ s channels to remain active while removing only the specific episodes of his shows and podcasts that they said violated their content guidelines .
Stitcher and Apple , however , took a less wishy-washy approach . On Thursday night , Stitcher responded to an angry tweet about Jones ’ s presence on the platform with a note that it had removed his podcasts .
Thanks for your note . We have reviewed Alex Jones ’ podcasts and found he has , on multiple occasions , harassed or allowed harassment of private individuals and organizations , ( 1/2 ) — Stitcher ( @ Stitcher ) August 3 , 2018
and that harassment has led listeners of the show to engage in similar harassment and other damaging activity . Therefore , we have decided to remove his podcasts from the Stitcher platform . ( 2/2 ) — Stitcher ( @ Stitcher ) August 3 , 2018
And Stitcher didn ’ t have to wait long before another podcast platform joined with its position . Apple has never hosted Infowars on Apple Podcasts or iTunes , but its search engine included off-site listings for the podcast . Not anymore . As first reported by BuzzFeed , five Infowars podcasts were removed from Apple ’ s search index as of Sunday evening .
“ Apple does not tolerate hate speech , and we have clear guidelines that creators and developers must follow to ensure we provide a safe environment for all of our users , ” an Apple spokesperson told BuzzFeed Sunday evening . “ Podcasts that violate these guidelines are removed from our directory making them no longer searchable or available for download or streaming . ”
Despite Zuckerberg ’ s previous fence-sitting on the subject , Facebook was the first to move into action after news broke that Apple had entirely removed Jones ’ s library . Early Monday morning , the platform unpublished four of Infowars ’ pages . “ The timing of Facebook ’ s announcement was unusual , with the company confirming the ban at 3am local time , ” the Guardian noted about Facebook ’ s early morning purge .
Facebook ’ s official statement on the removal noted that since its initial ban of four Infowars videos in July , “ more content from the same Pages has been reported to us , ” which the company found “ violates our graphic violence policy , and using dehumanizing language to describe people who are transgender , Muslims and immigrants , which violates our hate speech policies . ”
YouTube was next to fall in line , banning Jones late Monday morning by removing all of his channels . In a statement , a YouTube spokesperson told ███ , “ All users agree to comply with our Terms of Service and Community Guidelines when they sign up to use YouTube . When users violate these policies repeatedly , like our policies against hate speech and harassment or our terms prohibiting circumvention of our enforcement measures , we terminate their accounts . ”
YouTube had previously warned Jones by applying a “ strike ” to his account for content violation , as well as suspending Jones ’ s live-streaming privileges ; however , Jones apparently continued to live-stream from his other channels despite the suspension — so YouTube ultimately saw fit to give him the boot .
Now that the pressure is on , many people are calling for Twitter and other social platforms to take action against Jones next . Pinterest , for example , has since pulled Infowars ’ page , which apparently existed .
While I 'm very glad that @ Facebook , @ Apple , & @ Spotify have finally taken the step to remove Alex Jones & Infowars from their platforms , it 's past time that @ Twitter & @ YouTube step up .
They are spreading hate , lies , and violence . — Shaun King ( @ shaunking ) August 6 , 2018
So far , Jones is still a verified Twitter user , and multiple accounts related to various Infowars productions remain active . ███ has reached out to Twitter for comment , with no response ; however , Twitter has reportedly issued a statement that Jones ’ s accounts do not violate its content policies .
A Twitter spokesman has gotten back to us to say Alex Jones and Infowars do not currently violate Twitter 's rules . — Jack Nicas ( @ jacknicas ) August 6 , 2018
And Infowars ’ reach is still mighty . Some media outlets have noted that despite Apple ’ s removal of Jones ’ s shows from its Podcasts platform , the Infowars app is still available on Apple ’ s mobile app store , where it currently has a 5-star rating . Similarly , Infowars ’ 4.9-rated Android app is still available in the Google Play store ( though its download count of 10,000 feels refreshingly small ) .
However , the online public seems to be celebrating the move , especially from Facebook and YouTube , as a definitive and crucial step forward in the fight against fake news and fringe extremism .","Within the past 24 hours, Apple, Facebook, and YouTube have all joined in summarily banning far-right broadcaster and known conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his Infowars network from their platforms.

The bans have been swift and startling, coming after mounting public backlash against Infowars’ pernicious rhetoric, which is most notorious for helping popularize the false belief that the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting never happened. Jones is currently the defendant in a precedent-setting lawsuit brought against him by the parents of a Sandy Hook victim.

But the ongoing conversation around the real-life damage Jones and his network have inflicted has also been accompanied by weeks of hedging from major internet companies, including Facebook and Spotify, about how to deal with Jones on their platforms while still protecting free speech.

Initially, Facebook, YouTube, and Spotify all took selective action, banning some episodes of Jones’s podcasts and shows or removing selected social media posts they found to be in violation of various policies while allowing Infowars channels to remain active.

Williamson, Jonah Goldberg, Victor Davis Hanson, Yuval Levin","A man places an American flag amid flowers a day after a mass shooting at a Walmart store in El Paso , Texas , August 4 , 2019 . ( Callaghan O'Hare/Reuters )
People can decide for themselves what to make of hateful words , whether in Mein Kampf or a murderer ’ s manifesto .
As horrifying as the killings by the El Paso and Dayton shooters are , let ’ s not make free speech another casualty of these murders .
In the wake of the El Paso shootings , many commentators have attacked the Drudge Report for publishing the killer ’ s alleged 2,300-word manifesto entitled “ The Inconvenient Truth. ” The document states the killer drew inspiration from white racial-supremacy theories found in a manifesto written by the murderer of 51 Muslims at two mosques in Christchurch , New Zealand , last March .
The document gets specific in its hate . It denounces the “ invasion of Texas ” by Hispanics , the “ cultural and ethical replacement ” of whites , and “ race mixing ” as “ selfish . ”
Former Fox News reporter Adam Housley , who lost a niece in a mass shooting in California last year , tweeted : “ Would the racist diatribe of this slimeball have been published if he hadn ’ t murdered anyone ? Nope . So we publish now and wonder why others then copy . ”
In another tweet , Housley added that the manifesto “ needs to be public….it does not need to be published and promoted. ” But if something isn ’ t published , how public is it ?
In addition to understanding the twisted motivations of mass killers , a reason that it ’ s important to allow ordinary citizens to access their writings is that the media can ’ t always be counted to provide a full interpretation or context of their motivations .
How many Americans know that the El Paso killer also made it clear that he hates automation and corporations , and blames them for a stagnant economy even while he blames Hispanics for environmental degradation ? His solution harkens back to the most fanatical views of zero-population-growth advocates : “ If we can get rid of enough people , ” he wrote , “ then our way of life can become more sustainable. ” Ambitious left-wing projects such as universal health care and Universal Basic Income “ would become far more likely to succeed if tens of millions of dependents are removed . ”
We ’ ve already learned that the shooter who killed nine people outside a Dayton , Ohio bar , early this morning described himself as a “ pro-Satan “ leftist , ” and that he was a registered Democrat who supported Elizabeth Warren and hated President Trump and law enforcement . Who knows what else we may learn about the complexity of his background and thinking ?
The El Paso killer expressed admiration for the Christchurch killer ’ s manifesto , perhaps because they were on a similar wavelength . The Christchurch killer clearly hated minorities , but his racism was rooted in environmentalist concerns :
The environment is being destroyed by over population . . . . We Europeans are one of the groups that are not over populating the world . The invaders are the ones over populating the world . Kill the invaders , kill the overpopulation , and by doing so save the environment .
This is not to minimize the racist white-supremacist views expressed by either killer , but merely to say they don ’ t neatly fit into a Right-–Left paradigm . But that ’ s not a message many people want to hear .
Last March , John Lott , head of the Crime Prevention Research Center and author of the book More Guns , Less Crime , sent out this tweet trying to debunk claims that the Christchurch shooter was a right-winger .
New Zealand killer ’ s manifesto says that he did attack to get more gun control/gun bans in New Zealand and the US , Killer was a socialist , environmentalist who hated capitalists and trade .
After this post , Twitter blocked Lott ’ s Twitter account without explanation .
Lotte later noted that the killer had even called himself an “ eco-fascist ” and had written , “ The nation with the closest political and social values to my own is the People ’ s Republic of China. ” Lott then included a link to send people to a story on his website that explained why his tweet was accurate . “ The link conclusively proved what I said was truthful , ” he told me .
Lott appealed to Twitter and asked for specifics . He was informed he had lost his appeal , but Twitter officials still gave no reason for blocking his account . Off the record , a Twitter representative explained to me that their move likely resulted from the company having to comply with regulations that the New Zealand government imposed , banning publication of quotes from the Christchurch manifesto . But the Twitter representative did not explain why Twitter had not blocked left-wing tweets linking to avowedly racist quotes from the manifesto . Sounds like a PC double standard to me .
New Zealand ’ s restrictions on use of the manifesto are indeed draconian . It has made it a crime to possess or distribute it anywhere in the country . “ People who have downloaded this document , or printed it , should destroy any copies , ” warned David Shanks , the chief censor in New Zealand ’ s Department of Internal Affairs . Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern also has pressed Facebook to deny access worldwide to the manifesto , and she has promised to “ look at the role social media played ” in reporting on the attacks . “ They are the publisher , not just the postman , ” she charged .
Nor is New Zealand the only country where free speech has been chilled . In June , Michael Cooper , a Conservative Party member of Canada ’ s Parliament , was permanently removed from the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights after reading an excerpt from the Christchurch shooter ’ s manifesto .
During a hearing on online hate speech , Cooper had read a passage from the manifesto to counter claims by a Muslim witness that linked conservatism with racism and violence . The passage merely quoted the shooter ’ s statements that he was not a conservative but rather an admirer of China . After protests at Cooper ’ s speech escalated , the hearing was hastily adjourned — Cooper was unable to finish his remarks .
All of this amounts to an attempt to intimidate people from engaging in a full discussion about the motives of some of the mass shooters .
No one is denying that white supremacism is on the rise , but people should not have their eyes and ears covered over with cotton wool by those who think they can ’ t handle the full story . As blogger C. J . Harris Kretzer tweeted :
People have a right to read the “ manifesto ” for themselves if only to judge the killer ’ s motives for themselves as opposed to trusting the media ’ s interpretation of the killer ’ s motives . I like to have original source material to view and judge for myself .
Indeed , Mein Kampf , Hitler ’ s infamous manifesto , is freely available in most countries . Even German authorities recently legalized its publication , saying that people needed to understand the nature of evil and how it expressed itself . Restricting access to the rantings of mass killers only makes their writings a form of “ forbidden fruit ” — all the more sought after because they are censored .","A man places an American flag amid flowers a day after a mass shooting at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, August 4, 2019.

His solution harkens back to the most fanatical views of zero-population-growth advocates: “If we can get rid of enough people,” he wrote, “then our way of life can become more sustainable.” Ambitious left-wing projects such as universal health care and Universal Basic Income “would become far more likely to succeed if tens of millions of dependents are removed.”

We’ve already learned that the shooter who killed nine people outside a Dayton, Ohio bar, early this morning described himself as a “pro-Satan “leftist,” and that he was a registered Democrat who supported Elizabeth Warren and hated President Trump and law enforcement. Who knows what else we may learn about the complexity of his background and thinking?

The El Paso killer expressed admiration for the Christchurch killer’s manifesto, perhaps because they were on a similar wavelength. The Christchurch killer clearly hated minorities, but his racism was rooted in environmentalist concerns:

The environment is being destroyed by over population. . . . We Europeans are one of the groups that are not over populating the world. The invaders are the ones over populating the world. Kill the invaders, kill the overpopulation, and by doing so save the environment.

This is not to minimize the racist white-supremacist views expressed by either killer, but merely to say they don’t neatly fit into a Right-–Left paradigm. But that’s not a message many people want to hear.

Last March, John Lott, head of the Crime Prevention Research Center and author of the book More Guns, Less Crime, sent out this tweet trying to debunk claims that the Christchurch shooter was a right-winger.

New Zealand killer’s manifesto says that he did attack to get more gun control/gun bans in New Zealand and the US, Killer was a socialist, environmentalist who hated capitalists and trade.

After this post, Twitter blocked Lott’s Twitter account without explanation.

Lotte later noted that the killer had even called himself an “eco-fascist” and had written, “The nation with the closest political and social values to my own is the People’s Republic of China.” Lott then included a link to send people to a story on his website that explained why his tweet was accurate. “The link conclusively proved what I said was truthful,” he told me.

Lott appealed to Twitter and asked for specifics. He was informed he had lost his appeal, but Twitter officials still gave no reason for blocking his account. Off the record, a Twitter representative explained to me that their move likely resulted from the company having to comply with regulations that the New Zealand government imposed, banning publication of quotes from the Christchurch manifesto. But the Twitter representative did not explain why Twitter had not blocked left-wing tweets linking to avowedly racist quotes from the manifesto. Sounds like a PC double standard to me.

New Zealand’s restrictions on use of the manifesto are indeed draconian. It has made it a crime to possess or distribute it anywhere in the country. “People who have downloaded this document, or printed it, should destroy any copies,” warned David Shanks, the chief censor in New Zealand’s Department of Internal Affairs. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern also has pressed Facebook to deny access worldwide to the manifesto, and she has promised to “look at the role social media played” in reporting on the attacks. “They are the publisher, not just the postman,” she charged.

Nor is New Zealand the only country where free speech has been chilled. In June, Michael Cooper, a Conservative Party member of Canada’s Parliament, was permanently removed from the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights after reading an excerpt from the Christchurch shooter’s manifesto.

During a hearing on online hate speech, Cooper had read a passage from the manifesto to counter claims by a Muslim witness that linked conservatism with racism and violence. The passage merely quoted the shooter’s statements that he was not a conservative but rather an admirer of China. After protests at Cooper’s speech escalated, the hearing was hastily adjourned — Cooper was unable to finish his remarks.

All of this amounts to an attempt to intimidate people from engaging in a full discussion about the motives of some of the mass shooters.

No one is denying that white supremacism is on the rise, but people should not have their eyes and ears covered over with cotton wool by those who think they can’t handle the full story. As blogger C. J . Harris Kretzer tweeted:

People have a right to read the “manifesto” for themselves if only to judge the killer’s motives for themselves as opposed to trusting the media’s interpretation of the killer’s motives. I like to have original source material to view and judge for myself.

Indeed, Mein Kampf, Hitler’s infamous manifesto, is freely available in most countries. Even German authorities recently legalized its publication, saying that people needed to understand the nature of evil and how it expressed itself. Restricting access to the rantings of mass killers only makes their writings a form of “forbidden fruit” — all the more sought after because they are censored.",www.nationalreview.com,right,i0KgiWfaUnhcLY4F

In these two sentences , the letter ’ s author , John Ellison , betrays a common misunderstanding of “ trigger warnings ” and “ safe spaces ” —both of which exist for the exact purpose of “ building a campus that welcomes people of all backgrounds. ” Trigger warnings are not intended to shield students from controversial material ; they ’ re intended to warn students about disturbing content so that they won ’ t be shocked by it .

EDITOR'S NOTE: This story took place in January, but tech giants like Facebook and Google have been under scrutiny all year for censorship of conservative views.

Evangelist Franklin Graham has revealed that he was suspended from Facebook for taking a stand for his biblical beliefs. The temporary ban lasted 24 hours, and while the censorship itself is shocking enough, it was also surprising that the ban was retroactive, resulting from a comment he made two years ago.

""Well, now we know. Facebook has a secret rulebook for policing speech. I was banned from posting on Facebook last week for 24 hours. Why? Because of a post from back in 2016 about North Carolina's House Bill 2 (the bathroom bill),"" Graham explained in a weekend Facebook post.

The suspension raises serious questions as critics ask, if Facebook is willing to block one of the most prominent Christian leaders in the world, then what's next?

The stunning announcement also reinforces ongoing reports of censorship against Christian beliefs by other social media giants and the tech companies that control so much of the communication and interaction in our world today – companies like Google, Twitter and Apple.

A Facebook spokesperson admitted to The Charlotte Observer that Graham was indeed punished for his post. And while the spokesperson is now apologizing for censoring Graham, it's clear that some of Facebook's team of 15,000 speech police can censor conservative Christians at will.

The cartoon Michael de Adder drew was for publishing company, Brunswick News Inc. in New Brunswick.

The company has since terminated his contact after the drawing went viral on social media, however the firm has said it was not specifically because of the illustration.

The cartoon, posted on de Adder's Twitter account on June 26, shows Trump standing beside a golf cart together with his golf club, while looking down at the bodies of a father and daughter who drowned while crossing the Rio Grande from Mexico into Texas.

'Do you mind if I play through?' Trump is seen to ask in the cartoon.

The cartoon itself is inspired by the image of Oscar Alberto Martinez Ramirez and his 23-month-old daughter Valeria

It is universally acknowledged in America that the death of an innocent person is a tragedy worth our attention. Where we differ is on what can — and should — be done to prevent the next one. That there exists in this country a range of considered and heartfelt opinion as to how a free society should respond to savage mass shootings apparently hasn’t occurred to the march’s participants. Repeatedly, those who disagreed with the ill-considered prescriptions of the speakers were cast as shills or monsters, or as traitors to their country, their faith, and their posterity. The worst of the vitriol was cast at Senator Marco Rubio, a man who has been more open and accommodating than most in the wake of the Parkland shooting, but who has been repaid for his efforts with attacks on his character, his sincerity, and his religious beliefs. He was far from the only target. To listen to the parade of hostility was to be told that to support the Second Amendment is to be a revanchist, an outcast, or a vassal.

Bluntly put, there is no meaningful way in which students in the United States are being forced to march “for their lives.” Children today live in an America that is safer than it has been at any point since the 1960s. One’s chance of being killed in a school is around six times lower than one’s chance of being hit by lightning. Hideous as it was, the event that precipitated Saturday’s march was a classic “black swan” attack, the solution to which is not at all obvious.

A recent Gallup poll shows that nearly 60 percent of the adults in America under the age of 30 believe that socialism is acceptable. Equally troubling, less than 25 percent of that same age group is exceptionally proud to be an American.

How did we get to this point? The answer is years of liberal dominance in education, media and entertainment.

Young people get a steady stream of liberal bias from the first time they turn on the TV or watch an animated movie. It continues in school with teachers talking affectionately about candidates who side with their unions and loathingly about those who do not. And for those who try to be objective, the textbooks many are forced to use are filled with liberal bias.

Once they get to a college campus, left-wing professors either fill their minds with liberal propaganda or intimidate them from speaking out about their true feelings on the issues. They got bombarded with more liberal talking points on most news outlets and social media platforms and throughout other forms of entertainment.

In some ways, it is remarkable that only 58 percent of young people are open to socialism. Thank God for so many good conservative mentors (family, friends, teachers, clergy and others) for helping the other 42 percent cut through much of the nonsense.

To succeed going forward, however, we have to do better. Despite having the deck stacked against us, we must find a way to make a greater impact.

Looking ahead, we need to expand the impact of organizations like Young America’s Foundation (YAF). This is the reason I agreed to take on the role of president of this remarkable organization early in 2021.

This week is YAF’s 50th anniversary. Back in 1969, a group of students at Vanderbilt University felt that conservative viewpoints were not getting fair treatment on campus. They wanted to bring intellectual diversity and conservative principles to higher education on a nationwide scale.

Fifty years later, that vital work continues through Young America’s Foundation. The young people of America need to hear the truth about the benefits of common-sense conservative values now more than ever before in our history.

Ron Robinson, his board, staff and numerous supporters have built YAF into a remarkable organization. Their projects include President Ronald Reagan’s Rancho del Cielo and the Reagan Ranch Center in Santa Barbara, California. There, high school and college students are immersed in our 40th president’s passion for freedom.

YAF’s National Journalism Center helps aspiring journalists in the values of balanced, responsible and accurate reporting. YAF’s Center for Entrepreneurship & Free Enterprise educates and inspires young people to defend and articulate free enterprise principles.

Young Americans for Freedom, started by William F. Buckley Jr., is YAF’s chapter affiliate on more than 500 college and high school campuses across the country. It includes the largest campus lecture series — featuring speakers like Ben Shapiro, Katie Pavlich, Michael Knowles, Art Laffer, Jonah Goldberg, Dinesh D’Souza, Burt Folsom and Liz Wheeler. And they are involved with campus initiatives like the 9/11: Never Forget Project and Freedom Week commemorating the fall of the Berlin Wall.

YAF is an incredibly effective organization. Looking to the future, it has to build off of that success. Here are some clear goals:

• YAF has some 500 chapters on college and high school campuses across the country. Ideally, there should be a YAF chapter on every campus.

• In addition to chapters at four-year college and university campuses, YAF should organize chapters at two-year technical and community colleges. There is incredible untapped potential here.

•In addition to expanding chapters on high school campuses, YAF should aim to reach students at an earlier age — ideally in their pre-teens — with positive messages about freedom, free enterprise and conservative values.

• YAF already has the largest campus lecture program in the country. The foundation should seek to broaden its reach and work to reach even more people via technology like YouTube broadcasts, Facebook Watch, and more.

• As YAF and other partner organizations broaden their reach on campuses, liberals will work even harder to stifle conservative thought. YAF must continue to lead the way to fight for free speech rights — for their speakers and others.

• With a disturbing number of conservative students feeling intimidated from speaking their minds on campus, YAF needs to take on more efforts to support students and let them know that they are not alone.

The success of the past 50 years will help meet the challenges of the future. Most importantly, Young America’s Foundation must continue to promote freedom.

California has been ground zero for the campus free-speech crisis. Maybe now California can contribute to the solution.

The New York Times calls Ngo an “ independent journalist. ” CNN describes him as a “ conservative journalist. ” Other outlets term Ngo a “ conservative writer ” to distinguish him from actual reporters .
But none of these labels get at who Ngo is . More importantly , they fail to define his role in far-right politics , media , and violence . An incident from October 2018 in Portland , Oregon , illustrates his role well .
It begins with Portland police killing Patrick Kimmons , a 27-year-old African-American male , in disputed circumstances . The Black Lives Matter–style activist group , Don ’ t Shoot Portland , called for a protest on October 6 . Kimmons ’ s family members joined in what local media described as a “ peaceful ” and uneventful event .
There was one dicey moment during the march . A driver made an illegal right turn into protesters who were in a crosswalk and had the walk sign . A local TV station that recorded the incident wrote : “ driver plows through protesters. ” Video shows a man stopping in front of a silver Lexus that then strikes him and pushes him for more than thirty feet . Down the block , a brief confrontation ensues with a protester shoving the driver once and others hitting his vehicle . The driver left in his car without any more incident as protesters yelled , “ Get out of here . ”
It was unremarkable . But another video of the incident began circulating where it is difficult to see the protester being struck , enabling false claims such as , “ # ANTIFA Anarchists Threaten Elderly Driver in Portland ! ” The story jumped to Fox News with Tucker Carlson replaying the obscured video , blaming everyone from Antifa and Occupy ICE to the Washington Post , Maxine Waters , Hillary Clinton , and protesters yelling at Trump officials in restaurants . Carlson ’ s guest was Andy Ngo playing an expert on lax law enforcement in Portland in an affected British accent . The Wall Street Journal gave Ngo a platform where he omitted crucial evidence that the driver deliberately struck a protester , while hyping outrage of a “ mob ” of “ angry , agitated ingrates and criminals ” marching for a dead black criminal , attacking a lone elderly white victim .
It ’ s farcical . The only significant lawbreaking was by the driver , who could have been charged with vehicular assault . But in a city that ’ s become an epicenter of far-right violence , the white nationalist friendly Patriot Prayer leaped on the faux outrage for a “ Flash march for law and order in PDX ” a week later . The march degenerated into street battles between right-wing fighters and masked antifascists as downtown bargoers looked on confused . At least one right-wing brawler was caught on video stomping a person on the ground , but no arrests were ever made . One reporter said they were maced by Antifa for no reason .
But it didn ’ t end there . The flash march created new viral moments . A video of a left-wing activist harassing a woman claiming to be a 9/11 widow was posted days later to The Daily Caller , which was cofounded by Tucker Carlson . ( The woman appears to have lied about being a 9/11 widow . ) Efforts to doxx the man hurling invective resulted in a professional skateboarder from Portland being falsely identified and inundated with death threats . Eventually the man in the video was identified , which started a new round of harassment . One source says the social service agency that fired him over the video “ was flooded with hundreds of harassing calls and Facebook messages that were explicitly racist and threatening to harm and kill staff . ”
Carlson credited Ngo with publicizing the videos . Ngo was a bit player , but the incident bolstered him . The incident was an example of a disturbing media model for the Trump era : opportunists using biased reporting , social media , and wild accusations inflame vigilante and digital mobs to target “ enemies ” such as the media , Democrats , and left-wing activists . Figures like Carlson and Ngo reap followers , prominence , and income from the outrage and threats of violence . But to keep the ratings and the money flowing , the outrage machine must be cranked ever louder , risking greater violence .
One political organizer in Portland who has received death threats stemming from Ngo ’ s work says , “ It ’ s an arms race for money , and the narrative isn ’ t the point — the grift is . The larger , more offensive thing you can do , the system rewards it . ”
This appears to be Ngo ’ s model . He uses social media to push biased opinions in conjunction with selectively edited videos that play to the bigotry of his audience . His followers get worked up , and this is often followed by a deluge of threats against his subject .
Jacobin has talked to six people in Portland , including journalists , political officials , and activists , who described harassing messages and threats of violence resulting from Ngo ’ s work or political involvement in Portland . Friends of two other activists claim they went into hiding after Ngo spread their names and they became targets of harassment . Some individuals who ’ ve tangled publicly with Ngo are reluctant to go on the record . They say they want to avoid the “ trauma ” of being subjected to a new round of death threats .
In fact , Ngo appears to rely on people not speaking up about his effect on them . He often writes of how activists won ’ t talk to him or they take down social media profiles after he focuses on them , seeming to imply they have something to hide . What he doesn ’ t mention is many say they are doing so to avoid harassment and threats of violence .
Madison , a Portland activist who tracks Ngo , says , “ Ngo signals this is a person that should be targeted , should be harassed , and should be threatened . Andy puts a target on them and that results in the person being doxxed . Andy is giving people explicit permission to unleash hatred and violence on people . He absolutely knows what he is doing . ”
Ngo is so intertwined with the specter of violence I encountered it after just a Facebook post . I wrote a post with the headline , “ Andy Ngo is no journalist. ” The post was shared by notorious right-wing figure , Carl Benjamin , aka , “ Sargon of Akkad , ” who has been featured on Ngo ’ s podcast and was banned from YouTube for repeatedly “ joking ” about raping a British Labour MP . In the comments on Benjamin ’ s post were calls for violence against myself , Antifa , and others . Within hours I started receiving threats directly , such as “ You ’ re a bunch of retards and it will be a glorious day when you all are dealt with , ” and “ You are a disgraceful liar . If you or anyone of your ilk throws even a fucking tissue at me or my family watch what the fuck happens to your family lol . ”
Now this model threatens to turn deadly . On June 29 , Andy Ngo was attacked in Portland while videoing a Patriot Prayer rally heavily outnumbered by Antifa . A video shows him being punched , kicked , and hit with coconut milkshakes and silly string by masked individuals . Within minutes , videos of the attack and of a beaten Ngo narrating the incident were picked up by right-wing media such as Breitbart that have a dodgy relationship to facts . Headlines screaming brutal assault , vicious assault , and vicious attack by Antifa on Ngo were pumped out .
The sensationalism breached the mainstream with CNN ’ s Jake Tapper sending out an ill-informed tweet above a video of Ngo being attacked , writing , “ Antifa regularly attacks journalists ; it ’ s reprehensible . ”
In a bizarre twist , the Portland police threw fuel on the fire by tweeting that some milkshakes thrown on June 29 “ contained quick-drying cement. ” The police never provided evidence and observers , including journalists , noted that many counterprotesters drank the milkshakes , making it extremely unlikely anyone could have laced them with concrete . But amplified by conspiracy theorists like Jack Prosobiec , the tweet went viral , whereupon right-wing media turned the disinformation into fact and the mainstream press treated it as a credible assertion . The police tweet incited the Right further and the group that made the milkshakes was deluged with death threats . It culminated in the city being flooded with death threats . Days after Ngo was attacked , City Hall was evacuated after a bomb threat . One source inside City Hall says the mayor ’ s office received “ insane vitriol ” and every office was receiving threats , including almost 100 harassing calls that tied up emergency service dispatchers .
Far-right figures responded to the June 29 attack on Ngo with graphic threats , and plan to hold an “ End Domestic Terrorism ” and “ End Antifa ” rally in Portland on August 17 . Such is the level of far-right anger that many in the city fear the rally could become another Charlottesville , or worse — given the anti-Latino murder spree in El Paso and other foiled white nationalist plots since then .
To be clear , the attack on Ngo should be condemned . It serves no political purpose , and the Left should not be attacking media makers , even if they use dicey methods . Some Antifa activists in Portland also admit the attack played into right-wing hands by elevating him .
That is exactly what ’ s happened . Trump has beatified Ngo as one of his sinless followers — “ A single man standing there with a camera who never got hit and never hit back before in his life ” — under assault from the “ evil ” Antifa full of “ sick , bad people . ”
But it would also be a mistake to see Ngo as an innocent or as a journalist , considering that whoever he turns his camera , social media , or pen on is at significant risk of being inundated with violent threats from the far right .
Shane Burley is author of Fascism Today : What It Is and How to End It , and a Portland-based journalist who covered the June 29 rally . He says , “ I would never condone what happened to Andy Ngo , but I think there is a reason why he got in a conflict with protesters and dozens of other reporters present seemed to be left alone . ”
Burley says , “ One way to think of Andy Ngo is he is part of a far-right mediasphere that creates victimization narratives of conservatism and profit from it . It ’ s all about the embattled American man who is under siege at every turn , whether its trans children , immigrant criminals , anchor babies , or dangerous college campuses . ‘ They are all out to destroy us and our values. ’ It ’ s an entire infrastructure that ’ s moved from commentary like National Review to populist media hucksters drumming up a controversy . Ngo doesn ’ t seem to have many real journalistic credentials , and any he does is from creating controversy . He gets in the Wall Street Journal and New York Post from being a conservative celebrity . His actual reporting is very infrequent and sparse . ”
Ngo adds a new element in facilitating violence , intentionally or not . Burley says , “ He appears to target ideological opponents , which can make them fair game for harassment and violent confrontation. ” The scale of the threats keep escalating . Now Portland is bracing for the August 17 rally .","The media don’t know what to make of Andy Ngo.

ANN COULTER'S BACKERS AT BERKELEY FILE LAWSUIT

A legal team led by Harmeet Dhillon, a San Francisco attorney who represents the College Republicans, filed a lawsuit claiming Berkeley has violated students' rights to free speech, a claim that school officials have denied.

“Every week we’re harassed and attacked. I’ve been spit on. I’ve been punched. They’ve destroyed our signs,” Naweed Tahmas, the vice president and spokesman for the Berkeley College Republicans, said on ""Fox & Friends.""

A civil rights lawsuit has been filed with four claims of equal protection, due process and two first amendment claims on free speech, according to Dhillon.

In banning white-supremacist websites, progressive tech giants set a dangerous precedent.

Last week, multiple major Internet corporations essentially cooperated to kick a hate site, The Daily Stormer, off the Internet. Cloudflare, GoDaddy, Google, and various other companies withdrew their services, and now one of the Internet’s most odious sites lives mainly on the “dark web,” largely inaccessible to the casual user.

This was an ominous development for free speech — and not because there is anything at all valuable about The Daily Stormer’s message. It’s an evil site. Its message is vile. Instead, The Daily Stormer’s demise is a reminder that a few major corporations now have far more power than the government to regulate and restrict free speech, and they’re hardly neutral or unbiased actors. They have a point of view, and they’re under immense pressure to use that point of view to influence public debate.

It’s a simple reality that the lines of Internet communication are in progressive political hands, these progressive corporations look to left-wing activists to define hate, and a large number of leftists believe to the core of their beings that “hateful” speech should be censored and suppressed whenever possible.

For example, just this week ProPublica, a respected journalism outlet, decided to study “how leading tech companies monetize hate.” The article begins by highlighting not the Klan or a white-supremacist militia but instead Jihadwatch.org. And how did it choose Jihad Watch?

Broadly put , the Right views inequalities as the inevitable ( and at times desirable ) consequences of the free decisions made by individuals pursuing happiness in liberal societies . The Left , by contrast , tends to consider the words “ inequality ” and “ injustice ” to be nearly synonymous , such that where there is inequality , there is injustice . This is why the Left sees income and wealth inequalities and blames them on a crooked capitalist system , or sees unequal outcomes between the sexes and blames them on the protocols of a misogynistic culture .

• “ When women preparing for a sex-change operation are given androgens , they improve on tests of mental rotation and get worse on tests of verbal fluency . ”

So, yes: Dark Web intellectuals agree that there is something fundamentally wrong with the social-justice Left, that political correctness is awful, and that free speech is indispensable to democratic societies. But, above all, they are convinced that the leftist dream of perfect parity in group outcomes will never come to pass, and that attempts to make it come to pass would likely be disastrous. They therefore represent a significant rightward shift in intellectual life — one that we conservatives are right to embrace and would be wrong to overlook.

BERKELEY (CBS SF) — Mayor of Berkeley Jesse Arreguin on Monday said it is time to confront the violent extremism on the left by treating black-clad Antifa protesters as a gang.

A large number of masked Antifa activists were seen jumping the barriers at a largely peaceful demonstration in Berkeley’s Martin Luther King Civic Center Park on Sunday.

Some began attacking Trump supporters at the rally.

“I think we should classify them as a gang,” said Arreguin. “They come dressed in uniforms. They have weapons, almost like a militia and I think we need to think about that in terms of our law enforcement approach.”

Arreguin said that while he does not support the far right, it was time to draw the line on the left as well, especially on the black-clad activists who showed up in force and took over both the protests and the park, and played a part in Sunday’s violent clashes.

“I think we are going to have to think ‘big picture’ about what is the strategy for how we are going to deal with these violent elements on the left as well,” said the mayor.

The mayor said it was also time for the non-violent protesters to take a stand.

“We also need to hold accountable and encourage people not to associate with these extremists because it empowers them and gives them cover,” said Arreguin.

On Monday, protest organizers defended Antifa’s presence.

“White supremacists and fascists are not welcome. And if the state is not going to protect us — and if they do not — then we are going to protect ourselves and welcome those who stand with us,” said Sara Kershner with the National Lawyers Guild.

KPIX 5 news crews observed that most of the conservative demonstrators in the park were Trump supporters who repeatedly denounced Nazis and racists.

WASHINGTON – CNN filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration in federal court, demanding that the White House return correspondent Jim Acosta's press credentials, the cable news network announced Tuesday.

""The wrongful revocation of these credentials violates CNN and Acosta’s First Amendment rights of freedom of the press, and their Fifth Amendment rights to due process,"" the network said in a statement posted to its website.

The network sought ""an immediate restraining order"" forcing the White House to return Acosta's White House credentials, and it ""will seek permanent relief as part of this process.""

""While the suit is specific to CNN and Acosta, this could have happened to anyone,"" the statement said. ""If left unchallenged, the actions of the White House would create a dangerous chilling effect for any journalist who covers our elected officials.""

The administration pulled Acosta's credentials last week after a heated exchange with President Donald Trump during a White House news conference in which the president called the CNN reporter a ""rude, terrible person."" Trump went after Acosta because he persisted in asking a question about the investigation into Russian election meddling after Trump called on another reporter.

Amid the back and forth, Acosta resisted a White House aide's effort to take the microphone from him. In justifying the decision to revoke Acosta's White House pass, spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the administration will ""never tolerate a reporter placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern.""

Sanders was criticized for tweeting a video that she claimed ""clearly documented"" Acosta's ""inappropriate behavior."" Aymann Ismail, a video producer for Slate, said the video's speed was altered to make it appear that Acosta gave the young woman a ""karate chop"" when he actually gently pushed her arm away.

The video was promoted by InfoWars, a far-right site that peddles conspiracy theories, including an assertion that the Sandy Hook shooting in which 20 children died in 2012 was a hoax.

The White House dismissed the lawsuit as ""more grandstanding from CNN"" in a statement Tuesday.

The administration argued that CNN has nearly 50 other reporters with ""hard pass"" White House credentials and that ""Mr. Acosta is no more or less special than any other media outlet or reporter with respect to the First Amendment."" The statement cited Acosta's refusal to surrender the microphone ""so that other reporters might ask their questions"" as the reason for Acosta's punishment.

If there is no check on this type of behavior it impedes the ability of the President, the White House staff, and members of the media to conduct business.""

Trump has gone after other reporters in the past week – including April Ryan of American Urban Radio Network, PBS correspondent Yamiche Alcindor and Acosta's CNN colleague Abby Phillip – and he indicated Friday that he might pull the credentials of other ""unprofessional"" journalists.

Sanders is named as a defendant in CNN's lawsuit, along with Trump, chief of staff John Kelly and deputy chief of staff for communication Bill Shine. The Secret Service, agency director Randolph Alles and an unidentified Secret Service agent are also listed as defendants.

CNN filed the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for Washington.

In the filing, the network called Acosta's ""severe and unprecedented punishment"" the ""culmination of years of hostility by President Trump against CNN and Acosta based on the contents of their reporting – an unabashed attempt to censor the press and exclude reporters from the White House who challenge and dispute the president's point of view.""

Trump has declared the news media the ""enemy of the American people,"" and CNN has consistently been a target of his ire. He began to label the network ""fake news"" before he took office, in another tense news conference Jan. 11, 2017, in which he called Acosta ""rude.""

Respect for free speech is withering on campus.

At Claremont McKenna College in California, protesters blocked the doors to a lecture hall preventing conservative author Heather Mac Donald from speaking. At Middlebury College in Vermont, a professor accompanying libertarian author Charles Murray was injured by an angry mob. At the University of California-Berkeley and its surrounding community, protests against scheduled speakers have turned ugly.

In just the place where the clash of ideas is most valuable, students are shutting themselves off to points of view they don’t agree with. At the moment when young minds are supposed to assess the strengths and weaknesses of arguments, they are answering challenges to their beliefs with anger and violence instead of facts and reason.

As much as university administrators lament student-led intolerance and narrow ideas about free speech, they played a role in their creation. For decades, colleges and universities, public and private, have been fighting in court to maintain ridiculous restrictions on expression. The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education catalogs them exhaustively. Last month, Fairmont State University in West Virginia finally accepted that students have a right to gather signatures on a petition without a school permit. In March at Regis University in Colorado, the school shut down a student sale that charged different prices for baked goods based on the buyers' race, gender, religion or sexuality to protest affirmative action. That's the same month the University of South Alabama tried to force a student to take down a Trump/Pence sign from his dorm room.

And just like university bureaucrats who try to shut down speech they don't like, student governments get in the act, too. Last month, Wichita State student government backed down from its decision to deny recognition to a student group, not because the group engaged in ""hate speech,"" but because the student group argued that hate speech is protected by the First Amendment.

More often than not, cases where universities or student governments restrict student speech like those in Kansas, Alabama, Colorado and West Virginia are overshadowed by the celebrity speech fights that get national headlines. Ann Coulter, the author and pundit, has been relishing the attention she has gotten from her on-again, off-again appearance at Berkeley. Not only did the pointless battle help her sell books and get booked onto television shows, it also made her seem more like a First Amendment heroine and less like a partisan bloviater.

Campus administrators and student groups, who defend the growing intolerance for unpopular ideas on campus, see themselves as protecting what New York University Vice Provost Ulrich Baer calls ""the rights, both legal and cultural, of minorities to participate in public discourse"" in a unique moment when Donald Trump, nationalism and the ""alt-right"" are on the rise. But those who'd restrict freedom of speech and association always have an important excuse for their actions. The grave threat of global communism abroad was no excuse for McCarthyism in Hollywood. European carnage in World War I was no excuse to shutter the German-language press at home.

Campus protesters are right that President Trump's America-first nationalism is a grave threat to many Americans. But unfettered First Amendment rights are the answer to the threat, not its cause.

free_speech,American Spectator,2,https://spectator.org/journalist-andy-ngo-attacked-by-antifa-at-portland-protest/,Journalist Andy Ngo Attacked by Antifa at Portland Protest,,"Jack Craver, John Jiang, Jeff Goldstein, George Parry, Amory Manuel, Larry Thornberry, Jeffrey Lord","Andy Ngo , a journalist covering a clash between far-right and far-left demonstrators in Portland , was sent to the ER after being surrounded and beaten by members of Antifa on Saturday . Ngo was punched in the head , covered with silly string and eggs , and struck with milkshakes that Portland PD later claimed were filled with quick-drying cement . Ngo ’ s camera equipment was stolen by a member of the group , which can be observed in this video . Ngo was recognized and attacked because of his history of documenting Antifa ’ s actions in Portland .
In both videos , Ngo can be seen walking among Antifa demonstrators with his camera out before he is rushed by a masked horde cloaked in black . The entire assault is captured ; it happens in an instant . One Antifa-affiliated demonstrator , in disguise , pulls Ngo ’ s camera away from him . Ngo is then sucker-punched by another masked protester , who quickly backpedals in retreat . The crowd closes in ; Ngo covers his head . He is kicked , sprayed with silly string , hit with milkshakes , and pelted with eggs . Taunts and profanity can be heard . Ngo makes his way from the street , trying to protect his head as the mob behind him cheers .
Andy Ngo was beaten for covering an anti-fascist protest against a demonstration by the far-right nationalist group known as the “ Proud Boys. ” Antifa and the Proud Boys alike have a history of promoting violence .

Ngo was punched in the head, covered with silly string and eggs, and struck with milkshakes that Portland PD later claimed were filled with quick-drying cement. Ngo’s camera equipment was stolen by a member of the group, which can be observed in this video. Ngo was recognized and attacked because of his history of documenting Antifa’s actions in Portland.

In both videos, Ngo can be seen walking among Antifa demonstrators with his camera out before he is rushed by a masked horde cloaked in black. The entire assault is captured; it happens in an instant. One Antifa-affiliated demonstrator, in disguise, pulls Ngo’s camera away from him. Ngo is then sucker-punched by another masked protester, who quickly backpedals in retreat. The crowd closes in; Ngo covers his head. He is kicked, sprayed with silly string, hit with milkshakes, and pelted with eggs. Taunts and profanity can be heard. Ngo makes his way from the street, trying to protect his head as the mob behind him cheers.

Andy Ngo was beaten for covering an anti-fascist protest against a demonstration by the far-right nationalist group known as the “Proud Boys.” Antifa and the Proud Boys alike have a history of promoting violence. A member of the Proud Boys threatened Portland’s mayor in January, and group members have participated in a number of street fights, some of which have led to arrests.

This Labor Day the good news is that I have been appointed as an adjunct professor of economics at George Washington University. I’ll be teaching a seminar in labor economics and public policy.

The bad news is that as a condition of my employment, I must become a card-carrying, dues-paying member of the Service Employees International Union Local 500 — or pay the SEIU an agency fee in order to get out of membership. The letter from Provost Forrest Maltzman tells me that “failure to pay dues or agency fees may result in termination.”

free_speech,Guest Writer - Left,0,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/27/supreme-court-cellphone-data-carpenter-first-amendment,OPINION: Supreme court cellphone case puts free speech – not just privacy – at risk,2017-11-27,"Jameel Jaffer, Alexander Abdo","On Wednesday , the supreme court will consider whether the government must obtain a warrant before accessing the rich trove of data that cellphone providers collect about cellphone users ’ movements . Among scholars and campaigners , there is broad agreement that the case could yield the most consequential privacy ruling in a generation .
Less appreciated is the significance of the case for rights protected by the first amendment . The parties ’ briefs make little mention of the first amendment , instead framing the dispute – for understandable reasons – as one about the right to privacy . Yet the court ’ s resolution of the case is likely to have far-reaching implications for the freedoms of speech , press and association .
Donald Trump wants to keep our draconian surveillance laws . Do n't let him do it | Trevor Timm Read more
The case , Carpenter v United States , arises out of the government ’ s prosecution of Timothy Carpenter for a series of armed robberies carried out in south-eastern Michigan and north-western Ohio several years ago . In the course of its investigation of the crimes , the government ordered Carpenter ’ s cellphone provider to turn over data it had collected relating to Carpenter ’ s movements . In response , the provider produced 186 pages listing every call that Carpenter had made over a 127-day period , as well as coordinates indicating where Carpenter had been at the beginning and end of each of those calls .
Importantly , it turned over these records even though the government had not obtained a warrant based on probable cause . Carpenter asked the court to suppress the government ’ s evidence under the fourth amendment , which protects the right to privacy .
Many cellphone users have only a vague understanding of the extent to which providers monitor their movements , but these companies now track us much more closely than even the most committed human spies ever could . Cellphones function by connecting to antennas – “ cell sites ” or “ cell towers ” – that provide cellular service . Those cell sites , which are owned and operated by the cellular companies , are programmed to record which phones connect to them , and when . They also record the direction from which the connecting phone ’ s signal is received and , often , the distance of the phone from the cell site .
So-called “ cell site location information ” is becoming ever more precise , because the cellular network is becoming ever more dense . The analytical tools that can be brought to bear on this information are also becoming more sophisticated , meaning that investigators can draw reliable conclusions from smaller and smaller amounts of data . It ’ s precisely because the information is so rich , of course , that the government is interested in accessing it .
Privacy scholars are watching Carpenter ’ s case closely because it may require the supreme court to address the scope and continuing relevance of the “ third-party-records doctrine ” , a judicially developed rule that has sometimes been understood to mean that a person surrenders her constitutional privacy interest in information that she turns over to a third party . The government contends that Carpenter lacks a constitutionally protected privacy interest in his location data because his cellphone was continually sharing that data with his cellphone provider .
Privacy advocates are rightly alarmed by this argument . Much of the digital technology all of us rely on today requires us to share information passively with third parties . Visiting a website , sending an email , buying a book online – all of these things require sharing sensitive data with internet service providers , merchants , banks and others . If this kind of commonplace and unavoidable information-sharing is sufficient to extinguish constitutional privacy rights , the digital-age fourth amendment will soon be a dead letter .
To understand the Carpenter case ’ s full significance , though , it ’ s necessary to consider the implications the government ’ s arguments have for first amendment rights . In a brief filed in support of Carpenter , 19 leading technologists explain how easy it is to use a person ’ s location data to learn about her beliefs and associations . ( We represent the technologists . ) With very few data points , the technologists observe , an analyst can learn whether a given person attended a public demonstration , attended a political meeting , or met with a particular activist or lawyer . With more data , an analyst can identify social networks and learn not only whether a given person was at a public demonstration but who else attended the demonstration with her .
Journalists and their sources might be at particular risk . Imagine parallel demands for the cell site location information of a journalist who exposed government misconduct and of all the government employees who had access to the information the journalist exposed . As the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press observes in its own brief filed in the Carpenter case , cell site location information “ can reveal the stories a journalist is working on before they are published , where a journalist went to gather information for those stories , and the identity of a journalist ’ s sources ” .
This is why it is a mistake to think about the Carpenter case solely through the lens of individual privacy . A defeat for Carpenter would be a defeat for privacy rights , but it would also mean a dramatic curtailment of first amendment freedoms .
The Carpenter case is the latest in a series of cases that have required the supreme court to consider the relevance of analog-era precedents to digital-age technologies . Although these cases were presented to the court as fourth amendment cases , the court was attentive to the implications of government surveillance for first amendment freedoms . When the court held that the fourth amendment precluded the government from installing a GPS device on a criminal suspect ’ s car without first obtaining a warrant , five justices cited some of the same concerns raised by the technologists we represent in Carpenter .
Do “ people reasonably expect that their movements will be recorded and aggregated in a manner that enables the government to ascertain , more or less at will , their political and religious beliefs [ and ] sexual habits ? ” Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked in her powerful concurrence .
Two years later , when the court ruled that the government could not search a criminal suspect ’ s cellphone without first obtaining a warrant , the court cited similar concerns .
Facial recognition is here . The iPhone X is just the beginning | Clare Garvie Read more
“ Awareness that the government may be watching chills associational and expressive freedoms , ” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote . Left unchecked , he warned , new forms of surveillance could “ alter the relationship between citizen and government in a way that is inimical to democratic society ” .

Among scholars and campaigners, there is broad agreement that the case could yield the most consequential privacy ruling in a generation.

Less appreciated is the significance of the case for rights protected by the first amendment. The parties’ briefs make little mention of the first amendment, instead framing the dispute – for understandable reasons – as one about the right to privacy. Yet the court’s resolution of the case is likely to have far-reaching implications for the freedoms of speech, press and association.

The case, Carpenter v United States, arises out of the government’s prosecution of Timothy Carpenter for a series of armed robberies carried out in south-eastern Michigan and north-western Ohio several years ago. In the course of its investigation of the crimes, the government ordered Carpenter’s cellphone provider to turn over data it had collected relating to Carpenter’s movements. In response, the provider produced 186 pages listing every call that Carpenter had made over a 127-day period, as well as coordinates indicating where Carpenter had been at the beginning and end of each of those calls.

Importantly, it turned over these records even though the government had not obtained a warrant based on probable cause. Carpenter asked the court to suppress the government’s evidence under the fourth amendment, which protects the right to privacy.

Many cellphone users have only a vague understanding of the extent to which providers monitor their movements, but these companies now track us much more closely than even the most committed human spies ever could. Cellphones function by connecting to antennas – “cell sites” or “cell towers” – that provide cellular service. Those cell sites, which are owned and operated by the cellular companies, are programmed to record which phones connect to them, and when. They also record the direction from which the connecting phone’s signal is received and, often, the distance of the phone from the cell site.

So-called “cell site location information” is becoming ever more precise, because the cellular network is becoming ever more dense. The analytical tools that can be brought to bear on this information are also becoming more sophisticated, meaning that investigators can draw reliable conclusions from smaller and smaller amounts of data. It’s precisely because the information is so rich, of course, that the government is interested in accessing it.

Privacy scholars are watching Carpenter’s case closely because it may require the supreme court to address the scope and continuing relevance of the “third-party-records doctrine”, a judicially developed rule that has sometimes been understood to mean that a person surrenders her constitutional privacy interest in information that she turns over to a third party. The government contends that Carpenter lacks a constitutionally protected privacy interest in his location data because his cellphone was continually sharing that data with his cellphone provider.

Privacy advocates are rightly alarmed by this argument. Much of the digital technology all of us rely on today requires us to share information passively with third parties. Visiting a website, sending an email, buying a book online – all of these things require sharing sensitive data with internet service providers, merchants, banks and others. If this kind of commonplace and unavoidable information-sharing is sufficient to extinguish constitutional privacy rights, the digital-age fourth amendment will soon be a dead letter.

To understand the Carpenter case’s full significance, though, it’s necessary to consider the implications the government’s arguments have for first amendment rights. In a brief filed in support of Carpenter, 19 leading technologists explain how easy it is to use a person’s location data to learn about her beliefs and associations. (We represent the technologists.) With very few data points, the technologists observe, an analyst can learn whether a given person attended a public demonstration, attended a political meeting, or met with a particular activist or lawyer. With more data, an analyst can identify social networks and learn not only whether a given person was at a public demonstration but who else attended the demonstration with her.

Journalists and their sources might be at particular risk. Imagine parallel demands for the cell site location information of a journalist who exposed government misconduct and of all the government employees who had access to the information the journalist exposed. As the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press observes in its own brief filed in the Carpenter case, cell site location information “can reveal the stories a journalist is working on before they are published, where a journalist went to gather information for those stories, and the identity of a journalist’s sources”.

This is why it is a mistake to think about the Carpenter case solely through the lens of individual privacy. A defeat for Carpenter would be a defeat for privacy rights, but it would also mean a dramatic curtailment of first amendment freedoms.

The Carpenter case is the latest in a series of cases that have required the supreme court to consider the relevance of analog-era precedents to digital-age technologies. Although these cases were presented to the court as fourth amendment cases, the court was attentive to the implications of government surveillance for first amendment freedoms. When the court held that the fourth amendment precluded the government from installing a GPS device on a criminal suspect’s car without first obtaining a warrant, five justices cited some of the same concerns raised by the technologists we represent in Carpenter.

Do “people reasonably expect that their movements will be recorded and aggregated in a manner that enables the government to ascertain, more or less at will, their political and religious beliefs [and] sexual habits?” Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked in her powerful concurrence.

Two years later, when the court ruled that the government could not search a criminal suspect’s cellphone without first obtaining a warrant, the court cited similar concerns.

“Awareness that the government may be watching chills associational and expressive freedoms,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote. Left unchecked, he warned, new forms of surveillance could “alter the relationship between citizen and government in a way that is inimical to democratic society”.

The court was right in these cases to take account of the implications of surveillance technology for rights protected by the first amendment. It should be similarly attentive to these implications in Carpenter. Without strong protections for individual privacy, the freedoms of speech, association and the press will wither.

In assessing whether Carpenter had a right to privacy in his location information, the court should consider what will remain of these indispensable democratic freedoms if the government is afforded access, without close judicial supervision, to the information that cellphone providers are continuously collecting about all of us, and to the other sensitive and even intimate records that all of us passively and routinely share with third parties.",www.theguardian.com,left,OnXADFabz9DI6mt7

But after violent protests this week forced the school to cancel the scheduled appearance of alt-right icon Milo Yiannopoulos , some are wondering if Berkeley is where free speech is hitting a roadblock .
After the protest on Wednesday evening by more than 1,500 demonstrators outside the Martin Luther King Jr. Student Union began to turn violent , instigated in part by what campus officials described as outsiders , the event was called off . On Thursday , the Berkeley College Republicans , who had hosted Yannopoulos ’ appearance , summed up their disappointment this way :
“ The Free Speech Movement is dead , ” the group said in a statement posted on its website . “ Last night , the Berkeley College Republicans ’ constitutional right to free speech was silenced by criminals and thugs seeking to cancel Milo Yiannopoulos ’ tour . Their success is a defeat for civilized society and the free exchange of ideas on college campuses across America . ”
The group thanked the campus police and university administration “ for doing all they could to ensure the safety of everyone involved . It is tragic that the birthplace of the Free Speech Movement is also its final resting place . ”
While the rest of the world may see student protesters as the ones behind the violence , campus officials on Thursday said non-students had hijacked what otherwise would have been a peaceful protest . And they referred pointedly to the fact that the Berkeley campus has been and will remain a bastion of protected speech , no matter what part of the ideological landscape its practitioners may inhabit .
“ We are proud of our history and legacy as the home of the Free Speech Movement , ” UC spokesman Dan Mogulof said Thursday . “ While we have made clear our belief that the inflaming rhetoric and provocations of Mr. Yiannopoulos were in marked opposition to the basic values of the university , we respected his right to come to campus and speak once he was invited to do so by a legitimate student group . ”
Mogulof said the violent protesters had waged an assault not simply on the physical campus , but on the free-speech ideals enshrined at UC Berkeley , “ which stands for and helps to maintain and nurture open inquiry and an inclusive civil society , the bedrock of a genuinely democratic nation . We are now , and will remain in the future , completely committed to Free Speech as essential to our educational mission and a vital component of our identity at UC Berkeley . ”
Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin , a Cal graduate , also weighed in , saying in a statement that the free-speech traditions don ’ t stop at the campus border , and he blasted the violent protesters for their actions .
“ I represent a city that stands united for community , for inclusion , and for a peaceful dialogue about the issues , and that stands united against bigotry , united against fear mongering , and united against violence towards anyone , ” said the mayor . “ For our community to be a beacon of light in these dark times , we must display our values of inclusion , keep each other and our community safe , embrace our right to peacefully assemble , and show the rest of the country our values in both speech and in action . ”
Some who were on hand for the protest were conflicted – upset that the university ’ s actions were a black eye for free speech , but recognizing that the level of violence erupting outside the venue dictated at the last minute that the event be stopped .
“ The Free Speech Movement started here and now we can ’ t let certain people speak ? ’ ’ said UC Berkeley student Danny Phan . “ That ’ s kind of hypocritical . In a way , I see the school ’ s decision as going against free speech , but I also think they were justified in cancelling the speech because I was there and saw the people wearing masks burning things and smashing windows . If they ’ d let the speech go on , it would have gotten a lot worse . ’ ’
Phan wondered whether the school ’ s real mistake was not in shutting the event down but in not being properly prepared for trouble . “ While free speech has taken a hit here , I don ’ t think it ’ s dead , ” said the political-science major . “ The next time , though , the school should be better prepared . It was these third-party actors , not us students , who sabotaged everything . ’ ’
The university knew for weeks that Yiannopoulos ’ appearance could prompt violent protests that could in turn threaten the school ’ s long tradition of facilitating free speech at every turn . In a statement last week , Chancellor Nicholas Dirks wrote that “ the concerns around the upcoming visit of a controversial speaker to campus make it necessary for us to reaffirm our collective commitment ” to free expression , calling the university “ a site of open inquiry and learning . ”
Referring to Berkeley ’ s commitment to free speech , he said the school has “ gone so far as to defend in court the constitutional rights of students of all political persuasions to engage in unpopular expression on campus . ”
And that expression , he wrote , would include Yiannopoulos , whom Dirks called “ a troll and provocateur who uses odious behavior in part to ‘ entertain , ’ but also to deflect any serious engagement with ideas . He has been widely and rightly condemned for engaging in hate speech . ”
Dirk said last week that the school was working closely with police to prepare , to “ ensure the event goes as planned , and to provide for the safety and security of those who attend , as well as those who will choose to protest Yiannopoulos ’ s appearance in a lawful manner . ”
On Thursday , school officials did not respond to questions about those preparations and whether officials had failed to properly protect free speech on campus by having enough police officers on hand to prevent violence from interfering with the speech .
In a statement , campus police officials said the appearance by Yiannopoulos was cancelled “ amid violence , destruction of property , and out of concern for public safety . ”
“ Of paramount importance this evening was the campus ’ s commitment to ensure the safety and security of those attending the event , the speaker , those who came to engage in lawful protest , as well as members of the public and the Berkeley campus community , ” the police said .

Also on tap for next month is a campus appearance by Ben Shapiro, another former Breitbart News editor, who is scheduled to speak Sept. 14 at the 1,900-capacity Zellerbach Hall. His appearance is sponsored by Berkeley College Republicans.

Shapiro told The Chronicle last week that he would welcome anyone who wanted to protest his appearance, but that “I’m actively telling people not to show up to defend my free speech. That’s the police’s job.”

UC Berkeley is charging the organizers of Shapiro’s appearance $15,000 for the campus’ security costs.

San Francisco Chronicle columnists Phillip Matier and Andrew Ross appear Sundays, Mondays and Wednesdays. Matier can be seen on the KPIX TV morning and evening news. He can also be heard on KCBS radio Monday through Friday at 7:50 a.m. and 5:50 p.m. Got a tip? Call (415) 777-8815, or email matierandross@sfchronicle.com.

free_speech,Pew Research Center,1,http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/08/26/social-media-and-the-spiral-of-silence/#fn-11806-1,Social Media and the ‘Spiral of Silence’,2014-08-26,"Keith Hampton, Lee Rainie, Weixu Lu, Maria Dwyer, Inyoung Shin, Kristen Purcell","A major insight into human behavior from pre-internet era studies of communication is the tendency of people not to speak up about policy issues in public—or among their family , friends , and work colleagues—when they believe their own point of view is not widely shared . This tendency is called the “ spiral of silence . ”
Some social media creators and supporters have hoped that social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter might produce different enough discussion venues that those with minority views might feel freer to express their opinions , thus broadening public discourse and adding new perspectives to everyday discussion of political issues .
We set out to study this by conducting a survey of 1,801 adults . It focused on one important public issue : Edward Snowden ’ s 2013 revelations of widespread government surveillance of Americans ’ phone and email records . We selected this issue because other surveys by the ███ at the time we were fielding this poll showed that Americans were divided over whether the NSA contractor ’ s leaks about surveillance were justified and whether the surveillance policy itself was a good or bad idea . For instance , Pew Research found in one survey that 44 % say the release of classified information harms the public interest while 49 % said it serves the public interest .
The survey reported in this report sought people ’ s opinions about the Snowden leaks , their willingness to talk about the revelations in various in-person and online settings , and their perceptions of the views of those around them in a variety of online and off-line contexts .
Overall , the findings indicate that in the Snowden case , social media did not provide new forums for those who might otherwise remain silent to express their opinions and debate issues . Further , if people thought their friends and followers in social media disagreed with them , they were less likely to say they would state their views on the Snowden-NSA story online and in other contexts , such as gatherings of friends , neighbors , or co-workers . This suggests a spiral of silence might spill over from online contexts to in-person contexts , though our data can not definitively demonstrate this causation . It also might mean that the broad awareness social media users have of their networks might make them more hesitant to speak up because they are especially tuned into the opinions of those around them .
People reported being less willing to discuss the Snowden-NSA story in social media than they were in person—and social media did not provide an alternative outlet for those reluctant to discuss the issues in person .
Fully 86 % of Americans reported in the Pew Research survey they were “ very ” or “ somewhat ” willing to have a conversation about the government ’ s surveillance program in at least one of the physical settings we queried —at a public meeting , at a family dinner , at a restaurant with friends , or at work . Yet , only 42 % of those who use Facebook or Twitter were willing to discuss these same issues through social media .
Of the 14 % of Americans who were not willing to discuss this issue in person , almost none ( 0.3 % ) said they were willing to have a conversation about this issue through social media . This challenges the notion that social media spaces might be considered useful venues for people sharing views they would not otherwise express when they are in the physical presence of others .
Not only were social media sites not an alternative forum for discussion , social media users were less willing to share their opinions in face-to-face settings .
We also did statistical modeling allowing us to more fully understand the findings by controlling for such things as gender , age , education levels , race , and marital status—all of which are related to whether people use social media and how they use it . That modeling allowed us to calculate how likely people were to be willing to express their views in these differing settings holding other things constant .
The results of our analyses show that , even holding other factors such as age constant , social media users are less likely than others to say they would join a discussion about the Snowden-NSA revelations .
In both offline and online settings , people said they were more willing to share their views on the Snowden-NSA revelations if they thought their audience agreed with them .
Previous research has shown that when people decide whether to speak out about an issue , they rely on reference groups—friendships and community ties—to weigh their opinion relative to their peers . In the survey , we asked respondents about their sense of whether different groups of people in their lives agreed or disagreed with their positions on the Snowden leaks . There was some notable variance between those who feel they know the views of their peers and those who do not know what others think . Generally , the more socially close people were—e.g . spouses or family members—the more likely it was that the respondents felt their views matched .
We again calculated how likely it was that someone would be willing to share their views in different settings , depending on their sense of whether their audience agreed with them . We found that , in the case of Snowden ’ s revelations about the NSA , it was clear that if people felt their audience supported them , they were more likely to say they would join a conversation :
At work , those who felt their coworkers agreed with their opinion on the government ’ s surveillance program were 2.92 times more likely to say they would join a conversation on the topic of Snowden-NSA .
At a family dinner , those who felt that family members agreed with their opinion were 1.90 times more likely to be willing to discuss the Snowden-NSA issue .
At a restaurant with friends , if their close friends agreed with their opinion people were 1.42 times more likely to be willing to discuss the Snowden-NSA matter .
On Facebook , if a person felt that people in their Facebook network agreed with their position on that issue , they were 1.91 times more likely to be willing to join a conversation on the topic of Snowden-NSA .
Those who do not feel that their Facebook friends or Twitter followers agree with their opinion are more likely to self-censor their views on the Snowden-NSA story in many circumstances—in social media and in face-to-face encounters .
In this survey on the Snowden-NSA matter , we found that when social media users felt their opinions were not supported online , they were less likely to say they would speak their minds . This was true not only in social media spaces , but also in the physical presence of others .
The average Facebook user ( someone who uses the site a few times per day ) was half as likely as other people to say they would be willing to voice their opinion with friends at a restaurant . If they felt that their online Facebook network agreed with their views on this issue , their willingness to speak out in a face-to-face discussion with friends was higher , although they were still only 0.74 times as likely to voice their opinion .
The typical Twitter user ( who uses the site a few times per day ) is 0.24 times as likely to share their opinions with colleagues at work as an internet user who does not use Twitter . However , Twitter users who felt that their online Twitter followers shared their opinion were less reserved : They were only 0.66 times less likely to speak up than other internet users .
The survey did not directly explore why people might remain silent if they felt that their opinions were in the minority . The traditional view of the spiral of silence is that people choose not to speak out for fear of isolation . Other Pew Research studies have found that it is common for social media users to be mistaken about their friends ’ beliefs and to be surprised once they discover their friends ’ actual views via social media . Thus , it might be the case that people do not want to disclose their minority views for fear of disappointing their friends , getting into fruitless arguments , or losing them entirely . Some people may prefer not to share their views on social media because their posts persist and can be found later—perhaps by prospective employers or others with high status . As to why the absence of agreement on social media platforms spills over into a spiral of silence in physical settings , we speculate that social media users may have witnessed those with minority opinions experiencing ostracism , ridicule or bullying online , and that this might increase the perceived risk of opinion sharing in other settings .
People also say they would speak up , or stay silent , under specific conditions .
In addition to exploring the impact of agreement/disagreement on whether people were willing to discuss the Snowden-NSA revelations , we asked about other factors that might shape whether people would speak out , even if they suspected they held minority views . This survey shows how the social and political climate in which people share opinions depends on several other things :
Their confidence in how much they know . Those who felt they knew a lot about the issues were more likely than others to say they would join conversations .
Those who felt they knew a lot about the issues were more likely than others to say they would join conversations . The intensity of their opinions . Those who said they had strong feelings about the Snowden-NSA matter were more willing than those with less intense feelings to talk about the subject .
Those who said they had strong feelings about the Snowden-NSA matter were more willing than those with less intense feelings to talk about the subject . Their level of interest . Those who said they were very interested in the Snowden-NSA story were more likely than those who were not as interested to express their opinions .
People ’ s use of social media did little to increase their access to information about the Snowden-NSA revelations .
We asked respondents where they were getting information about the debates swirling around the Snowden revelations , and found that social media was not a common source of news for most Americans . Traditional broadcast news sources were by far the most common sources . In contrast , social media sources like Facebook and Twitter were the least commonly identified sources for news on this issue .
There are limits to what this snapshot can tell us about how social media use is related to the ways Americans discuss important political issues . This study focuses on one specific public affairs issue that was of interest to most Americans : the Snowden-NSA revelations . It is not an exhaustive review of all public policy issues and the way they are discussed in social media .
The context of the Snowden-NSA story may also have made it somewhat different from other kinds of public debates . At the time of this study , the material leaked by Edward Snowden related to NSA monitoring of communications dealt specifically with “ meta-data ” collected on people ’ s phone and internet communications . For a phone call , the meta-data collected by the NSA was described as including the duration of the call , when it happened , the numbers the call was between , but not a recording of the call . For email , meta-data would have included the sender and recipient ’ s email addresses and when it was sent , but not the subject or text of the email .
Additional information leaked by Snowden after our study was completed suggests that Western intelligence agencies monitored and manipulated the content of online discussions and the NSA recorded the content of foreign phone calls . In reaction to these additional revelations , people may have adjusted their use of social media and their willingness to discuss a range of topics , including public issues such as government surveillance . However , given the limited extent of the information leaked by Snowden at the time the survey was fielded , it seems unlikely that the average American had extensively altered their willingness to discuss political issues . Future research may provide insight into whether Americans have become more or less willing to discuss specific issues on-and offline as a result of government surveillance programs . While this study focused on the Snowden-NSA revelations , we suspect that Americans use social media in similar ways to discuss and get news about other political issues .
An informed citizenry depends on people ’ s exposure to information on important political issues and on their willingness to discuss these issues with those around them . The rise of social media , such as Facebook and Twitter , has introduced new spaces where political discussion and debate can take place . This report explores the degree to which social media affects a long-established human attribute—that those who think they hold minority opinions often self-censor , failing to speak out for fear of ostracism or ridicule . It is called the “ spiral of silence . ”
This report is a collaborative effort based on the input and analysis of the following individuals :

This survey’s findings produced several major insights:

Overall, the findings indicate that in the Snowden case, social media did not provide new forums for those who might otherwise remain silent to express their opinions and debate issues. Further, if people thought their friends and followers in social media disagreed with them, they were less likely to say they would state their views on the Snowden-NSA story online and in other contexts, such as gatherings of friends, neighbors, or co-workers.

Some people may prefer not to share their views on social media because their posts persist and can be found later—perhaps by prospective employers or others with high status. As to why the absence of agreement on social media platforms spills over into a spiral of silence in physical settings, we speculate that social media users may have witnessed those with minority opinions experiencing ostracism, ridicule or bullying online, and that this might increase the perceived risk of opinion sharing in other settings.

People also say they would speak up, or stay silent, under specific conditions.

In addition to exploring the impact of agreement/disagreement on whether people were willing to discuss the Snowden-NSA revelations, we asked about other factors that might shape whether people would speak out, even if they suspected they held minority views. This survey shows how the social and political climate in which people share opinions depends on several other things:

Their confidence in how much they know. Those who felt they knew a lot about the issues were more likely than others to say they would join conversations.

Those who felt they knew a lot about the issues were more likely than others to say they would join conversations. The intensity of their opinions. Those who said they had strong feelings about the Snowden-NSA matter were more willing than those with less intense feelings to talk about the subject.

Those who said they had strong feelings about the Snowden-NSA matter were more willing than those with less intense feelings to talk about the subject. Their level of interest. Those who said they were very interested in the Snowden-NSA story were more likely than those who were not as interested to express their opinions.

People’s use of social media did little to increase their access to information about the Snowden-NSA revelations.

We asked respondents where they were getting information about the debates swirling around the Snowden revelations, and found that social media was not a common source of news for most Americans. Traditional broadcast news sources were by far the most common sources. In contrast, social media sources like Facebook and Twitter were the least commonly identified sources for news on this issue.

There are limits to what this snapshot can tell us about how social media use is related to the ways Americans discuss important political issues. This study focuses on one specific public affairs issue that was of interest to most Americans: the Snowden-NSA revelations. It is not an exhaustive review of all public policy issues and the way they are discussed in social media.

The context of the Snowden-NSA story may also have made it somewhat different from other kinds of public debates. At the time of this study, the material leaked by Edward Snowden related to NSA monitoring of communications dealt specifically with “meta-data” collected on people’s phone and internet communications. For a phone call, the meta-data collected by the NSA was described as including the duration of the call, when it happened, the numbers the call was between, but not a recording of the call. For email, meta-data would have included the sender and recipient’s email addresses and when it was sent, but not the subject or text of the email.

Additional information leaked by Snowden after our study was completed suggests that Western intelligence agencies monitored and manipulated the content of online discussions and the NSA recorded the content of foreign phone calls. In reaction to these additional revelations, people may have adjusted their use of social media and their willingness to discuss a range of topics, including public issues such as government surveillance. However, given the limited extent of the information leaked by Snowden at the time the survey was fielded, it seems unlikely that the average American had extensively altered their willingness to discuss political issues. Future research may provide insight into whether Americans have become more or less willing to discuss specific issues on-and offline as a result of government surveillance programs. While this study focused on the Snowden-NSA revelations, we suspect that Americans use social media in similar ways to discuss and get news about other political issues.

About this Report

An informed citizenry depends on people’s exposure to information on important political issues and on their willingness to discuss these issues with those around them. The rise of social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, has introduced new spaces where political discussion and debate can take place. This report explores the degree to which social media affects a long-established human attribute—that those who think they hold minority opinions often self-censor, failing to speak out for fear of ostracism or ridicule. It is called the “spiral of silence.”

Story Continued Below

In an interview with POLITICO, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Obama will use his final news conference to highlight his concerns about the restrictions on the media that the president-elect put in place during his campaign and transition, and what it might mean for his administration.

“The media environment is challenging, and the news media and the journalists who cover the White House will be challenged to rise to the occasion and adapt to the changing environment,” said Earnest, in an interview ahead of Wednesday. “I know the president is interested in showing his support for their efforts to do that.”

Even the location, aides say, is meant to send a message: Rather than heading to the State Dining Room, where many of his larger news conferences have been held, Obama will hold his last public event as president in the White House press briefing room, which Trump aides have said they may abandon in favor of a larger space to accommodate the heightened media interest.

According to Earnest, Obama had long been planning a last news conference, following the model of George W. Bush’s final appearance in the White House briefing room on Jan. 12, 2009, as a thank you and goodbye to the reporters who have covered the president in Washington, across the country and around the world over the past eight years. That would have been the plan, he said, had Hillary Clinton won as well.

But Earnest and other aides acknowledge that Trump’s behavior toward the press, from refusing to commit to the traditional “pool” coverage that gives reporters visibility into the actions of any president, to his news conference last week at which he shouted down a reporter, has given the event added significance.

Critics point to Obama’s efforts to prosecute whistleblowers and subpoena journalists' phone records, along with the White House’s preference for YouTube interviews and celebrity sit-downs, as being hypocritical. Obama also regularly teases reporters for asking him too many questions at once, which often occurs because reporters feel they rarely get access to the president.

But Obama has used the press to his advantage while abroad, as in Cuba last year, when the president’s staff roped Raúl Castro into a news conference during Obama’s trip to Havana. White House aides at the time told reluctant Cuban officials that there was nothing they could do when Obama finished speaking and was forced to call on reporters who shot their hands in the air.

""The challenges that are facing journalists in Cuba and Ethiopia are not as profound as the challenges that are facing the White House press corps,” Earnest said, “but there’s still a principle that’s worth defending, and this is a principle that is worth defending inside the halls of the West Wing as well.”

Obama has made sure to drive that home. In Beijing in November 2014, at a joint news conference with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Obama called on a reporter from The New York Times, which was then drawing intense attention for its reporting critical of the Chinese government. Obama smirked and shrugged as Xi at first ignored the reporter’s question, though the Chinese leader eventually returned with a warning that “media outlets need to obey China’s laws and regulations.”

In Ethiopia, which had jailed more journalists just before his arrival in July 2015, Obama deliberately said in front of the cameras gathered in a room in Haile Selassie’s old palace in Addis Ababa, where a temporary White House network provided rare wireless service in the country, that he “didn’t bite my tongue too much” in the private conversation that he’d just had with the prime minister about “freedom of the press and assembly.”

And in Havana, Obama very purposefully called on a reporter whose father had fled Fidel Castro’s Cuban revolution. When Raúl Castro ducked part of the reporter's question, Obama joined in himself from the stage to remind him of what he’d left out of his answer.

That reporter, CNN’s Jim Acosta, happens to have been the same reporter shouted down by Trump at the recent news conference and derided as being “fake news,” due to the president-elect’s visible anger about the network’s reporting that an unverified but extremely salacious dossier had been included in intelligence briefings given to both Obama and Trump.

The outgoing White House staff has pointedly noted all the access it has provided in the past eight years, given the questions that have been raised by the Trump team. Any active journalist — and in practice, a number of people who don’t appear to be actively affiliated with any news organization — has not only been cleared for entry to the briefing room, but many have also been regularly called on to ask questions. Though that space on the first floor of the West Wing has gotten crowded (when a woman fainted during Obama’s news conference in December, there was difficulty making space for her to recover), rarely has there been any issue in accommodating the daily needs.

Incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer, who on Sunday had a two-hour meeting about continued access to the building with White House Correspondents' Association President Jeff Mason, did not return a request for comment about the point that Obama and his staff are hoping to make. In a statement after their meeting, however, Mason called his discussion “constructive.”

In his own final briefing on Tuesday, Earnest repeatedly spoke of the “uniquely American feature of our democracy” that allows reporters on site to regularly have access to the West Wing and administration officials who work there. He urged reporters to fight to keep those standards, describing both a symbolic importance and actual importance to doing transparent, accountable reporting about the government.

In what seemed deliberate performance art, Earnest let his last briefing stretch past two hours and called on nearly every reporter whose hand went up, including several from foreign and smaller outlets.

Earnest acknowledged to one reporter that he was feeling sentimental as he signed off.

“It’ll take some getting used to, to see someone else standing up here,” Earnest said, then added with a cynical laugh, “or not.”",www.politico.com,left,9r8UUWvARW6nwEky

After left-wing fascists violently shut down a scheduled appearance by provocateur Milo Yiannopolous earlier this year , university officials informed the campus ' College Republicans chapter that bringing another controversial right-leaning figure to speak would now come with new , massive fees and additional obstacles . Rather than doing what it takes to defend freedom of speech and thought at the birthplace of the free speech movement , Cal administrators are punishing conservatives for the unacceptable reactionary tantrums of their ideological opponents , making conservative speech literally less free at the school . San Francisco 's CBS affiliate reports :
The university ’ s efforts to prevent an encore of the violent protests that forced them to cancel a talk by conservative activist Milo Yiannopoulos , have , according to campus Republicans , stifled free speech and made it increasingly difficult to bring conservative thinkers to Cal . Berkeley Campus Republicans spokesperson Troy Worden said , “ There is such a thing as the heckler ’ s veto . Basically , if they ’ re loud enough and violent enough , then they succeed in shutting down your event. ” Campus Republicans canceled an upcoming appearance by David Horowitz after university police told them that to insure they could provide adequate security…the event would have to be held in the middle of the day…and outside the center of campus . UC Berkeley spokesperson Dan Mogulof said , “ We ’ re sorry they had to cancel it . It has nothing to do whatsoever with the speaker ’ s perspective and everything to do with what law enforcement professionals believed needed to be done to provide a safe and secure event . ”

After left-wing fascists violently shut down a scheduled appearance by provocateur Milo Yiannopolous earlier this year, university officials informed the campus' College Republicans chapter that bringing another controversial right-leaning figure to speak would now come with new, massive fees and additional obstacles. Rather than doing what it takes to defend freedom of speech and thought at the birthplace of the free speech movement, Cal administrators are punishing conservatives for the unacceptable reactionary tantrums of their ideological opponents, making conservative speech literally less free at the school. San Francisco's CBS affiliate reports:

The university’s efforts to prevent an encore of the violent protests that forced them to cancel a talk by conservative activist Milo Yiannopoulos, have, according to campus Republicans, stifled free speech and made it increasingly difficult to bring conservative thinkers to Cal. Berkeley Campus Republicans spokesperson Troy Worden said, “There is such a thing as the heckler’s veto. Basically, if they’re loud enough and violent enough, then they succeed in shutting down your event.” Campus Republicans canceled an upcoming appearance by David Horowitz after university police told them that to insure they could provide adequate security…the event would have to be held in the middle of the day…and outside the center of campus. UC Berkeley spokesperson Dan Mogulof said, “We’re sorry they had to cancel it. It has nothing to do whatsoever with the speaker’s perspective and everything to do with what law enforcement professionals believed needed to be done to provide a safe and secure event.”

Worden is exactly right to invoke the term ""heckler's veto"" to describe this silencing dynamic, as the violent Left's appalling behavior is being rewarded by the school. The lesson here is a perverse one: The more violence you foment, the more likely you are to ensure that people with whom you disagree won't be able to voice their views on campus. And the university's spin doesn't fly; the cancellation has everything to do with the ""speaker's perspective,"" even if the administration isn't explicitly making a value judgment on his ideology. Conservatives are not technically banned from addressing on-campus audiences, but the conduct of the torch-and-pitchfork-wielding mob means that anyone wishing to organize such a gathering must fork over large sums of money, and jump through ridiculous logistical hoops, in order for the speech to be considered ""secure.""

free_speech,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/12/17100496/political-correctness-data,Everything we think about the political correctness debate is wrong,2018-03-12,"Matthew Yglesias, Li Zhou, Aja Romano, Anna North, Dylan Matthews, Ian Millhiser, Sean Collins","Many American pundits seem to firmly believe that the country stands at a precipice in which young , left-wing college students and recent graduates are the leading edge of a rising tide of illiberalism that comes in the form of “ political correctness ” and poses a clear and present danger to free speech and rational discourse .
David Brooks ’ s column last Friday starts with a reference to the heckling of Christina Hoff Sommers at a recent speaking engagement at a small private university in Portland , Oregon . But he swiftly pivots to broad generalizations about his “ basic understanding of how citizenship is supposed to work ” versus “ today ’ s students ” for whom “ reason , apparently , ceased to matter ” and instead “ see public life as an inevitable war of tribe versus tribe . ”
Eric Boehm writing in Reason , similarly but even more bombastically , refers to a climate of “ cultural decay ” and “ authoritarian political correctness ” that is leading us toward the sort of dystopia depicted in Ray Bradbury ’ s science fiction classic Fahrenheit 451 .
Conviction that these trends are big and real is so firmly entrenched that when Bari Weiss cited a fake Twitter account as evidence for her thesis about political correctness run amok — another column built around the Summers speech — the New York Times simply removed the example and appended an editor ’ s note without otherwise altering the column .
It is so accepted that there is a growing climate of authoritarianism that whether or not individual examples are true is fundamentally irrelevant .
Except robust data suggests that maybe it isn ’ t . Overall public support for free speech is rising over time , not falling . People on the political right are less supportive of free speech than people on the left . College graduates are more supportive than non-graduates . Indeed , a 2016 Knight Foundation survey showed that college students are less likely than the overall population to support restrictions on speech on campus . Among the public at large , meanwhile , the group whose speech the public is most likely to favor stifling is Muslims .
The alarm about student protesters , in other words , though not always mistaken about particular cases , is generally grounded in a completely mistaken view of the big-picture state of American society and public opinion , both on and off campus .
Since the 1970s , the General Social Survey has posed a question about whether five hypothetical speakers should be allowed to give a speech in your community — a communist , a homosexual , an opponent of all religion , a racist , and a person who favors replacing the elected government with a military coup .
Justin Murphy of the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom aggregated trend data about all five kinds of speakers and found that public support for free expression has been generally rising :
Now what ’ s true , obviously , is that public support for disallowing racist speech is not rising . Instead , it ’ s stayed roughly flat over the past 40 years or maybe fallen very slightly . But it ’ s simply not the case that anti-racist activism is just a particularly salient example of an overall trend toward less tolerance of free expression .
On the contrary , society has become dramatically more tolerant . If you want to find a disturbing trend here , you should probably look at the increased support for the coup advocate ( labeled “ militarist ” ) , which is arguably a form of tolerance gone too far .
When Murphy does a breakout of the GSS ’ s seven-point ideological scale , you can see that the trend people think they ’ re seeing isn ’ t exactly fake — but it provides a very incomplete picture .
What you see here is that people on the moderate left really have become less tolerant of racists while growing more tolerant of all other groups . Meanwhile , the other five ideological subcategories seem to have become more tolerant of everyone .
Also note that in general , people with left-wing ideological commitments are overall more tolerant than people with right-wing ones . There ’ s simply no evidence for the Brooks view that left-wing politics is producing closed-minded people . Indeed , as Murphy notes , this is not really much of a surprise as there is a well-known correlation between left-wing political commitments and the personality attribute known to psychologists as Openness to Experience . Somewhat ironically , two of the best-known popularizers of this point , Jonathan Haidt and Jordan Peterson , are vocal anti-PC activists , though survey data confirms exactly what their research predicts — left-wing people are more supportive of free expression .
I would not make a big deal out of this ideological disagreement , however , because the important thing is that there ’ s a generally rising level of support for free speech . The United States is a big country , and it ’ s possible to cherry-pick examples of lots of different things happening . But to assess broad trends , we need to look at systematic data , and the data indicates a trend toward more willingness to hear from disagreeable people , not less .
One important exception , however , comes from a newer question about Muslim speech .
About 10 years ago , the GSS added a new hypothetical speaker to its list — “ now consider a Muslim clergyman who preaches hatred of the United States . If such a person wanted to make a speech in your community preaching hatred of the United States , should he be allowed to speak , or not ? ”
Most Americans say he should not be allowed to speak , and that number seems roughly constant over the past decade .
An even larger share of the population , about 66 percent , says such a cleric should not be allowed to teach in a college , and a very slight majority , about 51 percent , says such a cleric ’ s books should be removed from a library .
Concern about the Muslim preacher is driven , one assumes , by the fact that anti-American violence committed in the name of Islam is a real phenomenon in the world , and people see anti-American advocacy from Muslim authority figures as potentially contributing to the violence .
Americans are , however , considerably more likely to be killed by right-wing hate groups than by Islamic extremists ; the Anti-Defamation League finds that right-wing extremists committed 74 percent of ideologically driven killings between 2007 and 2016 , down to “ only ” 59 percent in 2017 .
It ’ s also interesting to note that , contrary to the vision of a generation of young authoritarians brainwashed in elite universities , there is very little age polarization on these issues — 56 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds support the right of the racist to give a speech , versus 60 percent of the overall population .
Given the stark generation gaps that we see on many political issues these days , that ’ s a remarkably small divergence . It ’ s also quite possibly driven by compositional effects , since white people are moderately more supportive ( 62 percent ) of letting the racist speak but whites are a smaller share of the younger cohort .

David Brooks’s column last Friday starts with a reference to the heckling of Christina Hoff Sommers at a recent speaking engagement at a small private university in Portland, Oregon. But he swiftly pivots to broad generalizations about his “basic understanding of how citizenship is supposed to work” versus “today’s students” for whom “reason, apparently, ceased to matter” and instead “see public life as an inevitable war of tribe versus tribe.”

Eric Boehm writing in Reason, similarly but even more bombastically, refers to a climate of “cultural decay” and “authoritarian political correctness” that is leading us toward the sort of dystopia depicted in Ray Bradbury’s science fiction classic Fahrenheit 451.

Conviction that these trends are big and real is so firmly entrenched that when Bari Weiss cited a fake Twitter account as evidence for her thesis about political correctness run amok — another column built around the Summers speech — the New York Times simply removed the example and appended an editor’s note without otherwise altering the column.

It is so accepted that there is a growing climate of authoritarianism that whether or not individual examples are true is fundamentally irrelevant.

Except robust data suggests that maybe it isn’t. Overall public support for free speech is rising over time, not falling. People on the political right are less supportive of free speech than people on the left. College graduates are more supportive than non-graduates. Indeed, a 2016 Knight Foundation survey showed that college students are less likely than the overall population to support restrictions on speech on campus. Among the public at large, meanwhile, the group whose speech the public is most likely to favor stifling is Muslims.

The alarm about student protesters, in other words, though not always mistaken about particular cases, is generally grounded in a completely mistaken view of the big-picture state of American society and public opinion, both on and off campus.

What the data says about free speech

Since the 1970s, the General Social Survey has posed a question about whether five hypothetical speakers should be allowed to give a speech in your community — a communist, a homosexual, an opponent of all religion, a racist, and a person who favors replacing the elected government with a military coup.

Justin Murphy of the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom aggregated trend data about all five kinds of speakers and found that public support for free expression has been generally rising:

Now what’s true, obviously, is that public support for disallowing racist speech is not rising. Instead, it’s stayed roughly flat over the past 40 years or maybe fallen very slightly. But it’s simply not the case that anti-racist activism is just a particularly salient example of an overall trend toward less tolerance of free expression.

On the contrary, society has become dramatically more tolerant. If you want to find a disturbing trend here, you should probably look at the increased support for the coup advocate (labeled “militarist”), which is arguably a form of tolerance gone too far.

When Murphy does a breakout of the GSS’s seven-point ideological scale, you can see that the trend people think they’re seeing isn’t exactly fake — but it provides a very incomplete picture.

What you see here is that people on the moderate left really have become less tolerant of racists while growing more tolerant of all other groups. Meanwhile, the other five ideological subcategories seem to have become more tolerant of everyone.

Also note that in general, people with left-wing ideological commitments are overall more tolerant than people with right-wing ones. There’s simply no evidence for the Brooks view that left-wing politics is producing closed-minded people. Indeed, as Murphy notes, this is not really much of a surprise as there is a well-known correlation between left-wing political commitments and the personality attribute known to psychologists as Openness to Experience. Somewhat ironically, two of the best-known popularizers of this point, Jonathan Haidt and Jordan Peterson, are vocal anti-PC activists, though survey data confirms exactly what their research predicts — left-wing people are more supportive of free expression.

I would not make a big deal out of this ideological disagreement, however, because the important thing is that there’s a generally rising level of support for free speech. The United States is a big country, and it’s possible to cherry-pick examples of lots of different things happening. But to assess broad trends, we need to look at systematic data, and the data indicates a trend toward more willingness to hear from disagreeable people, not less.

One important exception, however, comes from a newer question about Muslim speech.

People want to block “anti-American Muslim clergymen” from speaking

About 10 years ago, the GSS added a new hypothetical speaker to its list — “now consider a Muslim clergyman who preaches hatred of the United States. If such a person wanted to make a speech in your community preaching hatred of the United States, should he be allowed to speak, or not?”

Most Americans say he should not be allowed to speak, and that number seems roughly constant over the past decade.

An even larger share of the population, about 66 percent, says such a cleric should not be allowed to teach in a college, and a very slight majority, about 51 percent, says such a cleric’s books should be removed from a library.

Concern about the Muslim preacher is driven, one assumes, by the fact that anti-American violence committed in the name of Islam is a real phenomenon in the world, and people see anti-American advocacy from Muslim authority figures as potentially contributing to the violence.

Americans are, however, considerably more likely to be killed by right-wing hate groups than by Islamic extremists; the Anti-Defamation League finds that right-wing extremists committed 74 percent of ideologically driven killings between 2007 and 2016, down to “only” 59 percent in 2017.

College graduates are more tolerant, not less

It’s also interesting to note that, contrary to the vision of a generation of young authoritarians brainwashed in elite universities, there is very little age polarization on these issues — 56 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds support the right of the racist to give a speech, versus 60 percent of the overall population.

Given the stark generation gaps that we see on many political issues these days, that’s a remarkably small divergence. It’s also quite possibly driven by compositional effects, since white people are moderately more supportive (62 percent) of letting the racist speak but whites are a smaller share of the younger cohort. African Americans have become more supportive over time of letting racists speak, with 56 percent saying it should be allowed in 2015 versus 47 percent back in 1975.

Last but by no means least, there is a strong correlation between educational attainment and support for allowing free speech — though it has narrowed a little bit over time.

College graduates are most likely to want to allow both the racist and the anti-American cleric to speak.

This likely reflects both college graduates’ generally higher openness to experience and probably also their greater ideological sophistication, which leaves them more likely to focus on the free speech aspect of the question rather than simply register disapproval of a bad speaker. Indeed, data from the College Senior Study appears to show a causal relationship between attending college and more open-mindedness — indicating that liberal arts education is more or less performing its expected function of exposing people to new ideas rather than serving an indoctrination function.

The PC debate would benefit from more facts and rigor

The overall debate about “political correctness” as a phenomenon tends to suffer from an excess of vagueness and ambiguity.

On the one hand, there is a fairly narrow debate about the attempted use of heckler’s veto tactics on a handful of college campuses — often in response to speaking invitations that appear to have been constructed primarily for the purpose of attracting hecklers. On the other hand, there is a fairly broad debate about a wide array of anti-racist activity that includes everything from the #OscarSoWhite hashtag to people being mean on Twitter to Bari Weiss to efforts to push the boundaries of who can be described as a “white supremacist.”

By rhetorically lumping in instances of rare, fairly extreme behavior with much more common behaviors under the broad heading of “political correctness,” it is easy to paint an alarming picture of the hecklers as a leading edge of an increasingly authoritarian political culture.

The fact that there does not appear to be any such trend — and that public desire to stymie free expression is concentrated in the working class and targeted primarily at Muslims — ought to prompt a reevaluation of the significance of on-campus dustups and perhaps greater attention to the specific contexts in which they arise.

Conversely, a clearer and more specific account of what's wrong with heckler’s veto tactics — rather than broad-brush efforts to castigate them as emblematic of a broad social crisis — might be more effective at actually persuading people not to engage in them.

First , he is not a student at any of the aforementioned universities and was not invited to the campuses by students or faculty . He was seeking space on campus that is available to the general public to rent out . In at least some cases , courts have found that public colleges have a somewhat freer hand to regulate the speech of non-students on campus who are not invited by students or faculty .
Second , although a general , unsubstantiated fear of violence is not enough to justify cancelling an approved speaking event , recent violence in Charlottesville and the fact that one of the organizers of the Texas A & M rally used the promotional tagline “ TODAY CHARLOTTESVILLE TOMORROW TEXAS A & M ” make security concerns more concrete , at least in the short term . The more concrete the security concerns are , the easier it is to justify the cancellation or denials .
Third , as David Frum , Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern point out , judges might decide cases differently when protesters are liable to show up brandishing guns , as happened in Charlottesville . Bad facts make bad law , so the saying goes . The general legal standard now is that if a public college opens itself up to outside speakers , it can not engage in viewpoint discrimination . Most cases of prior restraint censorship will fail in court under this standard . But in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy in Charlottesville , judges may look differently at these facts .
And that should trouble us : If a court decides in favor of the prior restraints , it could set a precedent that would do considerable harm to the free speech rights of speakers , students and faculty far beyond Spencer .
But what happens in a court of law is one thing . What happens in the court of public opinion is perhaps more important . As the famous jurist Learned Hand once said , “ Liberty lies in the hearts of men and women ; when it dies there , no constitution , no law , no court can save it . ”
And , unfortunately , there is evidence that freedom of speech needs a pacemaker .
If your social media newsfeed doesn ’ t provide ample anecdotal evidence that free speech is suffering a public relations crisis , look to the polling : A recent Knight Foundation study found that fewer than 50 percent of high school students think that people should be free to say things that are offensive to others .
The New York Times opinion page , for its part , has run three columns since April questioning the value of free speech for all , the most recent imploring the ACLU to “ rethink free speech ” —the same ACLU that at the height of Nazism , Communism and Jim Crow in 1940 released a leaflet entitled , “ Why we defend civil liberty even for Nazis , Fascists and Communists. ” The ACLU of Virginia carried on this honorable tradition of viewpoint-neutral free speech defense in the days before the Charlottesville protests . However , the Wall Street Journal reported this week that the ACLU “ will no longer defend hate groups seeking to march with firearms . ”
And how is the birthplace of the 1960s free speech movement faring ? In the wake of the riots that shut down alt-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos ’ speech at the University of California , Berkeley on February 1 , multiple students and alumni wrote that the violence and destruction of the Antifa protests were a form of “ self-defense ” against the “ violence ” of Yiannopoulos ’ speech . Watching videos of the protest , it is fortunate nobody was killed .
What ’ s to account for this shift ? One of our theories is that this generation of students comprises the children of students who went to college during the first great age of campus speech codes that spanned from the late 1980s through the early 90s . This is when colleges and universities first began writing over-broad and vague policies to regulate allegedly racist and sexist speech . Although that movement failed in the court of law , these codes have stubbornly persisted , and the view that freedom of speech is the last refuge of the “ three Bs ” —the bully , the bigot and the robber baron—found a home in classrooms .
When we speak on college campuses , our explanations of the critical role the First Amendment played in ensuring the success of the civil rights movement , the women ’ s rights movement and the gay rights movement are often met with blank stares . At a speech at Brown University , in fact , a student laughed when Greg pointed out that Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall was a steadfast defender of freedom of speech––as if it were impossible for a black icon of the civil rights movement to be a free-speech champion .
However , we don ’ t fault students for holding these opinions . The idea of free speech is an eternally radical and counterintuitive one that requires constant education about its principles . Censorship has been the rule for most of human history . True freedom of speech is a relatively recent phenomenon .

But even the “ free speech , but … ” responses seem to be falling out of favor . In the last few years—and especially after Charlottesville—we have observed increasing squeamishness about free speech , and not just in practice ; also in principle .
So how do we respond to the calls for censorship after Charlottesville ?
For most of our careers , the charge “ what if the Nazis came to town ? ” has been posed as a hypothetical retort to free speech defenses .

If you were to listen to scholars like Richard Delgado , the response should be to pass laws , to put people in jail , to do whatever it takes to stop the Nazi contagion from spreading . It ’ s a popular argument in Europe and in legal scholarship , but not in American courts .
There are a few problems with this response that free speech advocates have long recognized . For one , it doesn ’ t necessarily work ; since the passage of Holocaust denial and anti-Semitism laws in Europe , rates of anti-Semitism remain higher than in the U.S. , where no such laws exist . In fact , the Anti-Defamation League found that rates of anti-Semitism have gone down in America since it first began measuring anti-Semitic attitudes in 1964 .
We can not forget , too , that laws have to be enforced by people .

And after 1933 , such laws would have placed that power to censor in the hands of Hitler himself . Consider how such power might be used by the politician you most distrust . Consider how it is currently being used by Vladimir Putin in Russia .
What does history suggest as the best course of action to win the benefits of an open society while stemming the tide of authoritarians of any stripe ?

Story Continued Below

First, he is not a student at any of the aforementioned universities and was not invited to the campuses by students or faculty. He was seeking space on campus that is available to the general public to rent out. In at least some cases, courts have found that public colleges have a somewhat freer hand to regulate the speech of non-students on campus who are not invited by students or faculty.

Most cases of prior restraint censorship will fail in court under this standard. But in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy in Charlottesville, judges may look differently at these facts.

And that should trouble us: If a court decides in favor of the prior restraints, it could set a precedent that would do considerable harm to the free speech rights of speakers, students and faculty far beyond Spencer.

But what happens in a court of law is one thing. What happens in the court of public opinion is perhaps more important. As the famous jurist Learned Hand once said, “Liberty lies in the hearts of men and women; when it dies there, no constitution, no law, no court can save it.”

And, unfortunately, there is evidence that freedom of speech needs a pacemaker.

One of our theories is that this generation of students comprises the children of students who went to college during the first great age of campus speech codes that spanned from the late 1980s through the early 90s. This is when colleges and universities first began writing over-broad and vague policies to regulate allegedly racist and sexist speech.

However, we don’t fault students for holding these opinions. The idea of free speech is an eternally radical and counterintuitive one that requires constant education about its principles. Censorship has been the rule for most of human history. True freedom of speech is a relatively recent phenomenon. It perhaps reached its high point in the United States in the second half of the 20th century.

Most Americans claim that they venerate free speech in principle. So do most world leaders. Even censorial dictators like Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan sometimes feign support for it.

In the last few years—and especially after Charlottesville—we have observed increasing squeamishness about free speech, and not just in practice; also in principle.

So how do we respond to the calls for censorship after Charlottesville?

For most of our careers, the charge “what if the Nazis came to town?” has been posed as a hypothetical retort to free speech defenses. (Godwin’s law extends to free speech debates, too.) But the hypothetical is no longer a hypothetical: In Charlottesville, neo-Nazis carried swastikas through the streets and revived the Hitler salute.

If you were to listen to scholars like Richard Delgado, the response should be to pass laws, to put people in jail, to do whatever it takes to stop the Nazi contagion from spreading. It’s a popular argument in Europe and in legal scholarship, but not in American courts.

There are a few problems with this response that free speech advocates have long recognized. For one, it doesn’t necessarily work; since the passage of Holocaust denial and anti-Semitism laws in Europe, rates of anti-Semitism remain higher than in the U.S., where no such laws exist. In fact, the Anti-Defamation League found that rates of anti-Semitism have gone down in America since it first began measuring anti-Semitic attitudes in 1964.

What’s more, in the 1920s and 30s, Nazis did go to jail for anti-Semitic expression, and when they were released, they were celebrated as martyrs. When Bavarian authorities banned speeches by Hitler in 1925, for example, the Nazis exploited it. As former ACLU Executive Director Aryeh Neier explains in his book Defending My Enemy, the Nazi party protested the ban by distributing a picture of Hitler gagged with the caption, “One alone of 2,000 million people of the world is forbidden to speak in Germany.” The ban backfired and became a publicity coup. It was soon lifted.

We cannot forget, too, that laws have to be enforced by people. In the 1920s and early 30s, such laws would have placed the power to censor in the hands of a population that voted in large numbers for Nazis. And after 1933, such laws would have placed that power to censor in the hands of Hitler himself. Consider how such power might be used by the politician you most distrust. Consider how it is currently being used by Vladimir Putin in Russia.

What does history suggest as the best course of action to win the benefits of an open society while stemming the tide of authoritarians of any stripe? It tells us to have a high tolerance for differing opinions, and no tolerance for political violence. What distinguishes liberal societies from illiberal ones is that liberal societies use words, not violence or censorship to settle disputes.

But we should not be so myopic about the value of freedom of speech. It is not just a practical, peaceful alternative to violence. It does much more than that: It helps us understand many crucial, mundane and sometimes troubling truths.

Gay marriage champion and author Jonathan Rauch reminds us that in the same way that breaking a thermometer doesn’t change the temperature, censoring ideas doesn’t make them go away—it only makes us ignorant of their existence.

So what do we do about white supremacists? Draw a strong distinction between expression and violence: punish violence, but protect even speakers we find odious. Let them reveal themselves.

As Harvey Silverglate, a co-founder of our organization, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, says, it’s important to know who the Nazis are in the room.

Jones has hosted Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes, whom Facebook designated as a hate figure, on his show, and long pedaled a conspiracy theory about the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting. Yiannopoulus, a member of the alt-right and already banned by Twitter and the country of Australia, publicly praised McInnes this year.

As for Farrakhan, he is widely regarded as an anti-Semitic figure, and Ohio Republican Paul Nehlen is also known for his anti-Semitic and white nationalist views. Paul Joseph Watson, a British member of the alt-right who works with Infowars, has also been banned.

The company said it will continue to review pages, groups, content and individuals for potential violations of its hate policies.

Williamson, Victor Davis Hanson, Jonah Goldberg, Yuval Levin","Let ’ s ponder a disturbing question : What if the crisis of free speech on college campuses , with their often extreme intolerance for conservative points of view , represents the high point for free expression in a student ’ s life ? In other words , what if the “ real world ” is more repressive , more ignorant , and more punitive toward dissenting speech ? What if entire corporations adopt the ideologies and norms of the most ruthless campus social-justice warriors , ruining careers and depriving employees of their livelihoods when those employees dissent from the dominant ideology ?
In other words , what if the rest of corporate America starts acting like Google ?
Yesterday former Google employee James Damore filed a class-action lawsuit against Google , alleging systematic race , gender , and political bias against white , male , and conservative employees . Damore , you may recall , was summarily terminated after writing a lengthy memorandum noting that disproportionate male representation in tech fields may be more the result of individual choice and innate differences between men and women than of invidious discrimination . He also suggested some non-discriminatory methods for increasing diversity at Google . Scientists argued about his conclusions — some agreed with Damore , others vigorously disagreed — but rather than engage with Damore , Google proved one of his points ( that Google is hostile to dissenting views ) by summarily terminating his employment .
Damore has now answered Google with a legal broadside , and it ’ s extraordinary . Most people don ’ t have time to read his entire 181-page complaint , but those who do will find a comprehensive argument that Google ’ s corporate culture encourages , sanctions , and facilitates an extraordinary amount of abuse against conservative white males . And he has the receipts . Much of the complaint consists of screen shots of internal Google communications and postings on internal Google message boards that would constitute strong evidence of hostile-environment race-and-gender harassment if the the races and genders were reversed .
For example , “ Googlers ” ( that ’ s what employees call themselves , using Google ’ s silly corporate language ) relentlessly enforce a so-called “ Googley ” culture where employees blacklist conservatives ( blocking them from in-house communications ) , actually boo white-male hires , and openly discuss committing acts of violence against political opponents . The “ punch a Nazi ” debate is alive and well at Google , and the definition of “ Nazi ” is extraordinarily broad . In one posting , an employee proposes a “ moratorium on hiring white cis heterosexual abled men who aren ’ t abuse survivors. ” In another , an employee advertises a workshop on “ healing from toxic whiteness. ” Another post mocks “ white fragility. ” The examples go on and on , for page after page .
Damore also alleges ( and again , provides screenshots of emails and other communications to support his claims ) that managers actively attacked conservative employees , encouraged punitive actions against dissenters , and even awarded “ peer bonuses ” for speech attacking conservatives .
At the same time that Googlers crack down on standard conservative speech , mock white men , and deride whiteness , they exhibit a remarkable level of tolerance for unusual behavior . For example , Damore claims that “ an employee who sexually identifies as a ‘ yellow-scale wingless dragonkin ’ and an ‘ expansive ornate building ’ presented a talk entitled ‘ living as a plural being ’ at an internal company event . ”
It ’ s important to remember that Damore ’ s complaint represents his side of the story , and Google has yet to file a response , but the screenshots and images present a compelling prima facie case of racial and gender bias that would be intolerable and illegal in the vast majority of American jurisdictions , including under federal law . It ’ s important to remember that American civil-rights law is generally color-blind . In other words , it protects white employees every bit as much as it protects black employees , and conduct that would be unlawful if applied to African Americans or women is also unlawful if applied to whites or males .
Google is of course disproportionately male , but even disproportionately male organizations can commit unlawful acts of discrimination depending on the measures taken to diversify the workplace . Claiming a desire to diversify a workplace can ’ t justify , for example , hostile-environment harassment ; nor can it justify explicitly discriminatory hiring and firing decisions in any given department .
In addition , California ( unlike many states ) provides a limited degree of protection against political discrimination .

Social-justice warriors dominate a leading tech company.

Let’s ponder a disturbing question: What if the crisis of free speech on college campuses, with their often extreme intolerance for conservative points of view, represents the high point for free expression in a student’s life? In other words, what if the “real world” is more repressive, more ignorant, and more punitive toward dissenting speech? What if entire corporations adopt the ideologies and norms of the most ruthless campus social-justice warriors, ruining careers and depriving employees of their livelihoods when those employees dissent from the dominant ideology?

Scientists argued about his conclusions — some agreed with Damore, others vigorously disagreed — but rather than engage with Damore, Google proved one of his points (that Google is hostile to dissenting views) by summarily terminating his employment.

Damore has now answered Google with a legal broadside, and it’s extraordinary. Most people don’t have time to read his entire 181-page complaint, but those who do will find a comprehensive argument that Google’s corporate culture encourages, sanctions, and facilitates an extraordinary amount of abuse against conservative white males. And he has the receipts. Much of the complaint consists of screen shots of internal Google communications and postings on internal Google message boards that would constitute strong evidence of hostile-environment race-and-gender harassment if the the races and genders were reversed.

We live in a civilized society and civilized people don ’ t do things like that .

3 . Stupid people who work at colleges : The Left has ruined colleges . Is that a shock ? They basically ruin anything they touch ( think Venezuela ) . There appears to be only one group of grownups running a university today – The University of Chicago . Most colleges have a laundry list of imaginary rights people supposedly have and ways not to offend people of race , color , sex or sexual orientation .
They need to start with the first right ( free speech ) and tell students that they will be expelled ( no refund of their outrageous fees ) if you disrupt a speaker who is a guest in our home ( the campus ) . If you do any physical damage , we will have you arrested and prosecuted to the full extent of the law . They need to know they have no right to do either .
If reinforcing to the children ( and they are children ) who go to these colleges basic laws of civility is not the first responsibility of the college , then what is ? As many would say , the problem is the people running colleges are children themselves who have never experienced the harsh realities of life and/or have been protected for so long they forgot what those realities are and are ill-prepared to educate their students to those realities .
The Left has caused this problem and they have to cure it or it will be the death of the university system in the U.S. Parents need to start demanding that schools enforce free speech and not in restricted areas . The federal government needs to assert the power of the purse to withhold funds from universities that abuse the First Amendment and do not protect the free speech of all people on campus .

""Rather, we must model our values of inclusion — that means upholding the rights of others to have different perspectives and ensuring there is space in our community for differing viewpoints and ideologies, even those that may be in direct conflict with our own.""

The school and Chick-fil-A signed a 5-year contract extension in 2018.



Despite attacks, Chick-fil-A just keeps forging ahead



Chick-fil-A has been enduring left-wing attacks for years. But it seems that as the punches increase in number and intensity, the success of the franchise just keeps increasing: To wit, Chick-fil-A just became the third-largest restaurant chain in America, behind McDonald's and Starbucks.

But some folks are nevertheless doing their darndest to keep Chick-fil-A down:

Push to remove Chick-fil-A from Cal Poly campus gains momentum with faculty vote youtu.be

The rampaging mob forced the university to shut down an event featuring gay conservative firebrand and Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos.

“I’m outraged that Milo has been given a platform at UC Berkeley, and there should be no place for him here,” visiting assistant art professor Samara Haplerin told the Daily Californian. “He should be scared that people aren’t going to stand for this.”

Ironically, Milo had planned to deliver remarks defending free speech.

The British conservative journalist called the violence a “horrible spectacle and very humiliating for American higher education.”

The crowd hurled fireworks at police officers and smashed windows at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Student Union. They also damaged buildings in downtown Berkeley – including a Starbucks and a number of banks.

The bloodthirsty mob targeted several supporters of President Trump. One young lady wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat was attacked during a television interview. An unknown man sprayed some sort of liquid in her face.

The Daily Californian reports another Trump supporter was grabbed by a crowd of agitators and thrown to the ground. He escaped, but they grabbed his red hat and set it on fire. And police had to rescue another man who was bloodied and beaten.

The university released a statement blaming the violence on outsiders who they allege came to the campus to cause mayhem.

They also affirmed Milo’s right to speak on the liberal campus.

“Chancellor Nicholas Dirks made it clear that while Yiannopoulos’ views, tactics and rhetoric are profoundly contrary to those of the campus, UC Berkeley is bound by the Constitution, the law and the university’s values and Principles of Community, which include the enabling of free expression across the full spectrum of opinion and perspective.”

Those are very nice words – but they are meaningless – unless they are enforced. According to the university, not a single person was arrested. Not a single arrest, folks.

Did someone order the police officers to stand down? If so, who gave that order – and why?

So here's what needs to happen: President Trump should immediately issue an executive order blocking Berkeley students from receiving any federal funding. And the same goes for any other public universities that want to silence conservative voices.

Universities must guarantee free speech for all students – conservative and liberal. It’s time for the federal government to eradicate this un-American infestation in higher education.

So shut down Berkeley, Mr. President. Shut it down.

“No one’s safety is at risk from different opinions,” Milo told “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” “No one’s physical safety is endangered by political ideas from a speaker on campus, but universities have sort of allowed this stuff to happen, and even in some cases encouraged it.”

The event proceeded relatively peacefully , with minimal disruption .
But there were many who believed Stanford should never have allowed Spencer to speak in the first place , including a group of Stanford faculty and students who published an open letter urging the university to block Spencer 's talk .
The argument of the letter 's authors is that while they `` fully support the principle of academic freedom that allows us to disagree about issues , '' Spencer 's views on Islam are `` not debatable '' because they are `` fundamentally dehumanizing . ''
Whenever the claim is made that an identity group is inherently less worthy of full personhood — whether that claim is made about people who are Muslim , Rohingya , Jewish , Black , trans or gender non-conforming , Bosnian , queer , immigrants , Mexican , etc . — it is always unacceptable .

Consider students at the University of Florida who earlier this week vandalized promotional materials for an upcoming pro-life event on campus put on by the university 's Young Americans for Freedom . In a Facebook message bragging about the vandalism , one student wrote : `` just poured water on your lovely creations that are an insult to my entire major and life experiences ! ''

Meanwhile , after Laura Kipnis — the feminist Northwestern professor who was twice investigated by Northwestern for Title IX violations over her criticism of campus sexual politics — spoke at Wellesley College , the faculty on the school 's Commission for Ethnicity , Race , and Equity issued a statement calling for changes to the outside speaker policy . Speakers like Kipnis , the statement said , require students to `` invest time and energy in rebutting the speakers ' arguments… in order to affirm their humanity . ''
When Heather Mac Donald , a vocal critic of the Black Lives Matter movement , spoke last spring at Claremont McKenna College , violent protesters attempted to shut down the event , forcing the Manhattan Institute fellow to give her talk via livestream .

And who can forget the reaction of Yale students to Erika Christakis 's thoughtfully worded email , in October of 2015 , questioning whether an institution of higher education should police the Halloween costumes of adult college students ?
Students blasted Christakis and her husband , Nicholas , for failing to create a `` safe space '' for them , despite their reputations as nurturing residence mentors . In one article describing how her world was `` shaken '' by Christakis 's `` offensive '' email , a Yale student wrote , `` This kind of racism in disguise — where a false debate about 'free speech ' is used to question people of color 's humanity — needs to stop . ''
Two months after her email , Erika Christakis resigned from her teaching role at Yale , later explaining that she had `` lost confidence '' in her ability to teach in an environment where `` full discussion of certain topics… has almost become taboo .

[pullquote]

The sitting government, angry that dissenting citizens are challenging its hold on power, decides to subject those citizens to a long string of abuses, including bureaucratic delays that limit free speech rights, targeted audits designed for intimidation, and selective leaks of private information, for the purpose of humiliation.

When those efforts fail to stem the tide of dissent, the frustrated government tries to criminalize disagreement, handing over voluminous files on individual citizens to a powerful law enforcement agency, all in the hopes that law enforcement will take action, possibly even imprisoning dissenters.

Yet this is exactly the scenario that’s unfolding in the Obama administration’s IRS, where partisan zealots not only targeted conservatives for all the pain the IRS can inflict, it also dumped over 1.1 million documents taxpayer documents on the FBI in the hopes that the FBI would actively work to criminalize dissent.

It’s difficult to overstate the chilling effect of this recent revelation. Obama Administration officials were willing to go to the greatest of lengths – even to violate the law themselves – to suppress the Tea Party and limit Americans’ First Amendment rights.

And they did this without any evidence of Tea Party wrongdoing but rather because the Obama administration and key Democrats in Congress hated the Tea Party’s message and – even more – hated that Americans were responding.

Here’s what we now know: In response to blatant and overwhelming political pressure, the IRS launched a campaign to not just suppress Tea Party speech but also to effectively overrule a Supreme Court case that it did not like – Citizens United v. FEC.

In this effort it was cheered on not only by Congressional Democrats who specifically called for IRS action against named conservative groups, but also by the President of the United States, who publicly attacked Americans for exercising their First Amendment rights in speech after speech.

Using all the power inherent in America’s sprawling, unaccountable bureaucracies, it delayed applications, launched audits, leaked documents, and even attempted to enlist other agencies (like the Federal Election Commission) in its speech-suppressing effort.

All of this is bad enough, but attempting to enlist the FBI crosses a dangerous line.

To be clear, the IRS was not simply dedicated to stopping free speech, it was trying to use the full power of federal law enforcement to destroy lives. Prison sentences tear apart families, end careers, and destroy marriages. Prison sentences change people irrevocably. Yet the IRS was willing to take that step, to inflict that kind of punishment on American citizens, simply because it hated a growing conservative movement.

Did the FBI take the bait? Did it investigate the Tea Party in response to the IRS’s document dump? Is the FBI investigating the Tea Party even as it investigates the IRS for its own misconduct?

These are just some of the questions that the FBI and IRS now must answer. I’m hopeful that the FBI did the right thing and refused to participate in the IRS’s misconduct. I’m hopeful, but I can’t be certain.

In February, I called for a special counsel to investigate the IRS targeting scheme. Now that the IRS pulled the FBI into its own misconduct, a special counsel is more critical than ever. Can the public have confidence that the same FBI the IRS sought to turn on the Tea Party can it now properly investigate the IRS?

But I’m not waiting for a special counsel. As I’ve written before, at the ACLJ we represent 41 conservative groups in 22 states in a civil action against the IRS and its key officials. We intend to discover exactly how the IRS attempted to abuse the criminal justice system to punish conservative speech. We intend to hold the IRS accountable.

A movement is arising , undirected and driven largely by students , to scrub campuses clean of words , ideas , and subjects that might cause discomfort or give offense . Last December , Jeannie Suk wrote in an online article for The New Yorker about law students asking her fellow professors at Harvard not to teach rape law—or , in one case , even use the word violate ( as in “ that violates the law ” ) lest it cause students distress . In February , Laura Kipnis , a professor at Northwestern University , wrote an essay in The Chronicle of Higher Education describing a new campus politics of sexual paranoia—and was then subjected to a long investigation after students who were offended by the article and by a tweet she ’ d sent filed Title IX complaints against her . In June , a professor protecting himself with a pseudonym wrote an essay for Vox describing how gingerly he now has to teach . “ I ’ m a Liberal Professor , and My Liberal Students Terrify Me , ” the headline said . A number of popular comedians , including Chris Rock , have stopped performing on college campuses ( see Caitlin Flanagan ’ s article in this month ’ s issue ) . Jerry Seinfeld and Bill Maher have publicly condemned the oversensitivity of college students , saying too many of them can ’ t take a joke .
Listen to the audio version of this article : Feature stories , read aloud : download the Audm app for your iPhone . Two terms have risen quickly from obscurity into common campus parlance . Microaggressions are small actions or word choices that seem on their face to have no malicious intent but that are thought of as a kind of violence nonetheless . For example , by some campus guidelines , it is a microaggression to ask an Asian American or Latino American “ Where were you born ? , ” because this implies that he or she is not a real American . Trigger warnings are alerts that professors are expected to issue if something in a course might cause a strong emotional response . For example , some students have called for warnings that Chinua Achebe ’ s Things Fall Apart describes racial violence and that F. Scott Fitzgerald ’ s The Great Gatsby portrays misogyny and physical abuse , so that students who have been previously victimized by racism or domestic violence can choose to avoid these works , which they believe might “ trigger ” a recurrence of past trauma .
Some recent campus actions border on the surreal . In April , at Brandeis University , the Asian American student association sought to raise awareness of microaggressions against Asians through an installation on the steps of an academic hall . The installation gave examples of microaggressions such as “ Aren ’ t you supposed to be good at math ? ” and “ I ’ m colorblind ! I don ’ t see race. ” But a backlash arose among other Asian American students , who felt that the display itself was a microaggression . The association removed the installation , and its president wrote an e-mail to the entire student body apologizing to anyone who was “ triggered or hurt by the content of the microaggressions. ” According to the most-basic tenets of psychology , helping people with anxiety disorders avoid the things they fear is misguided . This new climate is slowly being institutionalized , and is affecting what can be said in the classroom , even as a basis for discussion . During the 2014–15 school year , for instance , the deans and department chairs at the 10 University of California system schools were presented by administrators at faculty leader-training sessions with examples of microaggressions . The list of offensive statements included : “ America is the land of opportunity ” and “ I believe the most qualified person should get the job. ” Read Follow-Up Notes Haidt and Lukianoff respond to critics
Debating the campus protests over race and free speech The press has typically described these developments as a resurgence of political correctness . That ’ s partly right , although there are important differences between what ’ s happening now and what happened in the 1980s and ’ 90s . That movement sought to restrict speech ( specifically hate speech aimed at marginalized groups ) , but it also challenged the literary , philosophical , and historical canon , seeking to widen it by including more-diverse perspectives . The current movement is largely about emotional well-being . More than the last , it presumes an extraordinary fragility of the collegiate psyche , and therefore elevates the goal of protecting students from psychological harm . The ultimate aim , it seems , is to turn campuses into “ safe spaces ” where young adults are shielded from words and ideas that make some uncomfortable . And more than the last , this movement seeks to punish anyone who interferes with that aim , even accidentally . You might call this impulse vindictive protectiveness . It is creating a culture in which everyone must think twice before speaking up , lest they face charges of insensitivity , aggression , or worse . We have been studying this development for a while now , with rising alarm . ( Greg Lukianoff is a constitutional lawyer and the president and CEO of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education , which defends free speech and academic freedom on campus , and has advocated for students and faculty involved in many of the incidents this article describes ; Jonathan Haidt is a social psychologist who studies the American culture wars . The stories of how we each came to this subject can be read here . ) The dangers that these trends pose to scholarship and to the quality of American universities are significant ; we could write a whole essay detailing them . But in this essay we focus on a different question : What are the effects of this new protectiveness on the students themselves ? Does it benefit the people it is supposed to help ? What exactly are students learning when they spend four years or more in a community that polices unintentional slights , places warning labels on works of classic literature , and in many other ways conveys the sense that words can be forms of violence that require strict control by campus authorities , who are expected to act as both protectors and prosecutors ? Power , identity , and speech in the new American university
Read more There ’ s a saying common in education circles : Don ’ t teach students what to think ; teach them how to think . The idea goes back at least as far as Socrates . Today , what we call the Socratic method is a way of teaching that fosters critical thinking , in part by encouraging students to question their own unexamined beliefs , as well as the received wisdom of those around them . Such questioning sometimes leads to discomfort , and even to anger , on the way to understanding . But vindictive protectiveness teaches students to think in a very different way . It prepares them poorly for professional life , which often demands intellectual engagement with people and ideas one might find uncongenial or wrong . The harm may be more immediate , too . A campus culture devoted to policing speech and punishing speakers is likely to engender patterns of thought that are surprisingly similar to those long identified by cognitive behavioral therapists as causes of depression and anxiety . The new protectiveness may be teaching students to think pathologically .
How Did We Get Here ? It ’ s difficult to know exactly why vindictive protectiveness has burst forth so powerfully in the past few years . The phenomenon may be related to recent changes in the interpretation of federal antidiscrimination statutes ( about which more later ) . But the answer probably involves generational shifts as well . Childhood itself has changed greatly during the past generation . Many Baby Boomers and Gen Xers can remember riding their bicycles around their hometowns , unchaperoned by adults , by the time they were 8 or 9 years old . In the hours after school , kids were expected to occupy themselves , getting into minor scrapes and learning from their experiences . But “ free range ” childhood became less common in the 1980s . The surge in crime from the ’ 60s through the early ’ 90s made Baby Boomer parents more protective than their own parents had been . Stories of abducted children appeared more frequently in the news , and in 1984 , images of them began showing up on milk cartons . In response , many parents pulled in the reins and worked harder to keep their children safe . The flight to safety also happened at school . Dangerous play structures were removed from playgrounds ; peanut butter was banned from student lunches . After the 1999 Columbine massacre in Colorado , many schools cracked down on bullying , implementing “ zero tolerance ” policies . In a variety of ways , children born after 1980—the Millennials—got a consistent message from adults : life is dangerous , but adults will do everything in their power to protect you from harm , not just from strangers but from one another as well .
These same children grew up in a culture that was ( and still is ) becoming more politically polarized . Republicans and Democrats have never particularly liked each other , but survey data going back to the 1970s show that on average , their mutual dislike used to be surprisingly mild . Negative feelings have grown steadily stronger , however , particularly since the early 2000s . Political scientists call this process “ affective partisan polarization , ” and it is a very serious problem for any democracy . As each side increasingly demonizes the other , compromise becomes more difficult . A recent study shows that implicit or unconscious biases are now at least as strong across political parties as they are across races . So it ’ s not hard to imagine why students arriving on campus today might be more desirous of protection and more hostile toward ideological opponents than in generations past . This hostility , and the self-righteousness fueled by strong partisan emotions , can be expected to add force to any moral crusade . A principle of moral psychology is that “ morality binds and blinds. ” Part of what we do when we make moral judgments is express allegiance to a team . But that can interfere with our ability to think critically . Acknowledging that the other side ’ s viewpoint has any merit is risky—your teammates may see you as a traitor . Social media makes it extraordinarily easy to join crusades , express solidarity and outrage , and shun traitors . Facebook was founded in 2004 , and since 2006 it has allowed children as young as 13 to join . This means that the first wave of students who spent all their teen years using Facebook reached college in 2011 , and graduated from college only this year . Andrew B. Myers These first true “ social-media natives ” may be different from members of previous generations in how they go about sharing their moral judgments and supporting one another in moral campaigns and conflicts . We find much to like about these trends ; young people today are engaged with one another , with news stories , and with prosocial endeavors to a greater degree than when the dominant technology was television . But social media has also fundamentally shifted the balance of power in relationships between students and faculty ; the latter increasingly fear what students might do to their reputations and careers by stirring up online mobs against them .
We do not mean to imply simple causation , but rates of mental illness in young adults have been rising , both on campus and off , in recent decades . Some portion of the increase is surely due to better diagnosis and greater willingness to seek help , but most experts seem to agree that some portion of the trend is real . Nearly all of the campus mental-health directors surveyed in 2013 by the American College Counseling Association reported that the number of students with severe psychological problems was rising at their schools . The rate of emotional distress reported by students themselves is also high , and rising . In a 2014 survey by the American College Health Association , 54 percent of college students surveyed said that they had “ felt overwhelming anxiety ” in the past 12 months , up from 49 percent in the same survey just five years earlier . Students seem to be reporting more emotional crises ; many seem fragile , and this has surely changed the way university faculty and administrators interact with them . The question is whether some of those changes might be doing more harm than good . The Thinking Cure For millennia , philosophers have understood that we don ’ t see life as it is ; we see a version distorted by our hopes , fears , and other attachments . The Buddha said , “ Our life is the creation of our mind. ” Marcus Aurelius said , “ Life itself is but what you deem it. ” The quest for wisdom in many traditions begins with this insight . Early Buddhists and the Stoics , for example , developed practices for reducing attachments , thinking more clearly , and finding release from the emotional torments of normal mental life .
Cognitive behavioral therapy is a modern embodiment of this ancient wisdom . It is the most extensively studied nonpharmaceutical treatment of mental illness , and is used widely to treat depression , anxiety disorders , eating disorders , and addiction . It can even be of help to schizophrenics . No other form of psychotherapy has been shown to work for a broader range of problems . Studies have generally found that it is as effective as antidepressant drugs ( such as Prozac ) in the treatment of anxiety and depression . The therapy is relatively quick and easy to learn ; after a few months of training , many patients can do it on their own . Unlike drugs , cognitive behavioral therapy keeps working long after treatment is stopped , because it teaches thinking skills that people can continue to use . The goal is to minimize distorted thinking and see the world more accurately . You start by learning the names of the dozen or so most common cognitive distortions ( such as overgeneralizing , discounting positives , and emotional reasoning ; see the list at the bottom of this article ) . Each time you notice yourself falling prey to one of them , you name it , describe the facts of the situation , consider alternative interpretations , and then choose an interpretation of events more in line with those facts . Your emotions follow your new interpretation . In time , this process becomes automatic . When people improve their mental hygiene in this way—when they free themselves from the repetitive irrational thoughts that had previously filled so much of their consciousness—they become less depressed , anxious , and angry .
The parallel to formal education is clear : cognitive behavioral therapy teaches good critical-thinking skills , the sort that educators have striven for so long to impart . By almost any definition , critical thinking requires grounding one ’ s beliefs in evidence rather than in emotion or desire , and learning how to search for and evaluate evidence that might contradict one ’ s initial hypothesis . But does campus life today foster critical thinking ? Or does it coax students to think in more-distorted ways ? Let ’ s look at recent trends in higher education in light of the distortions that cognitive behavioral therapy identifies . We will draw the names and descriptions of these distortions from David D. Burns ’ s popular book Feeling Good , as well as from the second edition of Treatment Plans and Interventions for Depression and Anxiety Disorders , by Robert L. Leahy , Stephen J. F. Holland , and Lata K. McGinn . Higher Education ’ s Embrace of “ Emotional Reasoning ” Burns defines emotional reasoning as assuming “ that your negative emotions necessarily reflect the way things really are : ‘ I feel it , therefore it must be true. ’ ” Leahy , Holland , and McGinn define it as letting “ your feelings guide your interpretation of reality. ” But , of course , subjective feelings are not always trustworthy guides ; unrestrained , they can cause people to lash out at others who have done nothing wrong . Therapy often involves talking yourself down from the idea that each of your emotional responses represents something true or important .
Emotional reasoning dominates many campus debates and discussions . A claim that someone ’ s words are “ offensive ” is not just an expression of one ’ s own subjective feeling of offendedness . It is , rather , a public charge that the speaker has done something objectively wrong . It is a demand that the speaker apologize or be punished by some authority for committing an offense . There have always been some people who believe they have a right not to be offended . Yet throughout American history—from the Victorian era to the free-speech activism of the 1960s and ’ 70s—radicals have pushed boundaries and mocked prevailing sensibilities . Sometime in the 1980s , however , college campuses began to focus on preventing offensive speech , especially speech that might be hurtful to women or minority groups . The sentiment underpinning this goal was laudable , but it quickly produced some absurd results . What are we doing to our students if we encourage them to develop extra-thin skin just before they leave the cocoon of adult protection ? Among the most famous early examples was the so-called water-buffalo incident at the University of Pennsylvania . In 1993 , the university charged an Israeli-born student with racial harassment after he yelled “ Shut up , you water buffalo ! ” to a crowd of black sorority women that was making noise at night outside his dorm-room window . Many scholars and pundits at the time could not see how the term water buffalo ( a rough translation of a Hebrew insult for a thoughtless or rowdy person ) was a racial slur against African Americans , and as a result , the case became international news . Claims of a right not to be offended have continued to arise since then , and universities have continued to privilege them . In a particularly egregious 2008 case , for instance , Indiana University–Purdue University at Indianapolis found a white student guilty of racial harassment for reading a book titled Notre Dame vs. the Klan . The book honored student opposition to the Ku Klux Klan when it marched on Notre Dame in 1924 . Nonetheless , the picture of a Klan rally on the book ’ s cover offended at least one of the student ’ s co-workers ( he was a janitor as well as a student ) , and that was enough for a guilty finding by the university ’ s Affirmative Action Office .
These examples may seem extreme , but the reasoning behind them has become more commonplace on campus in recent years . Last year , at the University of St. Thomas , in Minnesota , an event called Hump Day , which would have allowed people to pet a camel , was abruptly canceled . Students had created a Facebook group where they protested the event for animal cruelty , for being a waste of money , and for being insensitive to people from the Middle East . The inspiration for the camel had almost certainly come from a popular TV commercial in which a camel saunters around an office on a Wednesday , celebrating “ hump day ” ; it was devoid of any reference to Middle Eastern peoples . Nevertheless , the group organizing the event announced on its Facebook page that the event would be canceled because the “ program [ was ] dividing people and would make for an uncomfortable and possibly unsafe environment. ” Because there is a broad ban in academic circles on “ blaming the victim , ” it is generally considered unacceptable to question the reasonableness ( let alone the sincerity ) of someone ’ s emotional state , particularly if those emotions are linked to one ’ s group identity . The thin argument “ I ’ m offended ” becomes an unbeatable trump card . This leads to what Jonathan Rauch , a contributing editor at this magazine , calls the “ offendedness sweepstakes , ” in which opposing parties use claims of offense as cudgels . In the process , the bar for what we consider unacceptable speech is lowered further and further .
Since 2013 , new pressure from the federal government has reinforced this trend . Federal antidiscrimination statutes regulate on-campus harassment and unequal treatment based on sex , race , religion , and national origin . Until recently , the Department of Education ’ s Office for Civil Rights acknowledged that speech must be “ objectively offensive ” before it could be deemed actionable as sexual harassment—it would have to pass the “ reasonable person ” test . To be prohibited , the office wrote in 2003 , allegedly harassing speech would have to go “ beyond the mere expression of views , words , symbols or thoughts that some person finds offensive. ” But in 2013 , the Departments of Justice and Education greatly broadened the definition of sexual harassment to include verbal conduct that is simply “ unwelcome. ” Out of fear of federal investigations , universities are now applying that standard—defining unwelcome speech as harassment—not just to sex , but to race , religion , and veteran status as well . Everyone is supposed to rely upon his or her own subjective feelings to decide whether a comment by a professor or a fellow student is unwelcome , and therefore grounds for a harassment claim . Emotional reasoning is now accepted as evidence . If our universities are teaching students that their emotions can be used effectively as weapons—or at least as evidence in administrative proceedings—then they are teaching students to nurture a kind of hypersensitivity that will lead them into countless drawn-out conflicts in college and beyond . Schools may be training students in thinking styles that will damage their careers and friendships , along with their mental health .
Fortune-Telling and Trigger Warnings Burns defines fortune-telling as “ anticipat [ ing ] that things will turn out badly ” and feeling “ convinced that your prediction is an already-established fact. ” Leahy , Holland , and McGinn define it as “ predict [ ing ] the future negatively ” or seeing potential danger in an everyday situation . The recent spread of demands for trigger warnings on reading assignments with provocative content is an example of fortune-telling . The idea that words ( or smells or any sensory input ) can trigger searing memories of past trauma—and intense fear that it may be repeated—has been around at least since World War I , when psychiatrists began treating soldiers for what is now called post-traumatic stress disorder . But explicit trigger warnings are believed to have originated much more recently , on message boards in the early days of the Internet . Trigger warnings became particularly prevalent in self-help and feminist forums , where they allowed readers who had suffered from traumatic events like sexual assault to avoid graphic content that might trigger flashbacks or panic attacks . Search-engine trends indicate that the phrase broke into mainstream use online around 2011 , spiked in 2014 , and reached an all-time high in 2015 . The use of trigger warnings on campus appears to have followed a similar trajectory ; seemingly overnight , students at universities across the country have begun demanding that their professors issue warnings before covering material that might evoke a negative emotional response .
In 2013 , a task force composed of administrators , students , recent alumni , and one faculty member at Oberlin College , in Ohio , released an online resource guide for faculty ( subsequently retracted in the face of faculty pushback ) that included a list of topics warranting trigger warnings . These topics included classism and privilege , among many others . The task force recommended that materials that might trigger negative reactions among students be avoided altogether unless they “ contribute directly ” to course goals , and suggested that works that were “ too important to avoid ” be made optional . It ’ s hard to imagine how novels illustrating classism and privilege could provoke or reactivate the kind of terror that is typically implicated in PTSD . Rather , trigger warnings are sometimes demanded for a long list of ideas and attitudes that some students find politically offensive , in the name of preventing other students from being harmed . This is an example of what psychologists call “ motivated reasoning ” —we spontaneously generate arguments for conclusions we want to support . Once you find something hateful , it is easy to argue that exposure to the hateful thing could traumatize some other people . You believe that you know how others will react , and that their reaction could be devastating . Preventing that devastation becomes a moral obligation for the whole community . Books for which students have called publicly for trigger warnings within the past couple of years include Virginia Woolf ’ s Mrs. Dalloway ( at Rutgers , for “ suicidal inclinations ” ) and Ovid ’ s Metamorphoses ( at Columbia , for sexual assault ) .
Jeannie Suk ’ s New Yorker essay described the difficulties of teaching rape law in the age of trigger warnings . Some students , she wrote , have pressured their professors to avoid teaching the subject in order to protect themselves and their classmates from potential distress . Suk compares this to trying to teach “ a medical student who is training to be a surgeon but who fears that he ’ ll become distressed if he sees or handles blood. ” However , there is a deeper problem with trigger warnings . According to the most-basic tenets of psychology , the very idea of helping people with anxiety disorders avoid the things they fear is misguided . A person who is trapped in an elevator during a power outage may panic and think she is going to die . That frightening experience can change neural connections in her amygdala , leading to an elevator phobia . If you want this woman to retain her fear for life , you should help her avoid elevators . But if you want to help her return to normalcy , you should take your cues from Ivan Pavlov and guide her through a process known as exposure therapy . You might start by asking the woman to merely look at an elevator from a distance—standing in a building lobby , perhaps—until her apprehension begins to subside . If nothing bad happens while she ’ s standing in the lobby—if the fear is not “ reinforced ” —then she will begin to learn a new association : elevators are not dangerous . ( This reduction in fear during exposure is called habituation . ) Then , on subsequent days , you might ask her to get closer , and on later days to push the call button , and eventually to step in and go up one floor . This is how the amygdala can get rewired again to associate a previously feared situation with safety or normalcy .
Students who call for trigger warnings may be correct that some of their peers are harboring memories of trauma that could be reactivated by course readings . But they are wrong to try to prevent such reactivations . Students with PTSD should of course get treatment , but they should not try to avoid normal life , with its many opportunities for habituation . Classroom discussions are safe places to be exposed to incidental reminders of trauma ( such as the word violate ) . A discussion of violence is unlikely to be followed by actual violence , so it is a good way to help students change the associations that are causing them discomfort . And they ’ d better get their habituation done in college , because the world beyond college will be far less willing to accommodate requests for trigger warnings and opt-outs . The expansive use of trigger warnings may also foster unhealthy mental habits in the vastly larger group of students who do not suffer from PTSD or other anxiety disorders . People acquire their fears not just from their own past experiences , but from social learning as well . If everyone around you acts as though something is dangerous—elevators , certain neighborhoods , novels depicting racism—then you are at risk of acquiring that fear too . The psychiatrist Sarah Roff pointed this out last year in an online article for The Chronicle of Higher Education . “ One of my biggest concerns about trigger warnings , ” Roff wrote , “ is that they will apply not just to those who have experienced trauma , but to all students , creating an atmosphere in which they are encouraged to believe that there is something dangerous or damaging about discussing difficult aspects of our history. ” The new climate is slowly being institutionalized , and is affecting what can be said in the classroom , even as a basis for discussion or debate . In an article published last year by Inside Higher Ed , seven humanities professors wrote that the trigger-warning movement was “ already having a chilling effect on [ their ] teaching and pedagogy. ” They reported their colleagues ’ receiving “ phone calls from deans and other administrators investigating student complaints that they have included ‘ triggering ’ material in their courses , with or without warnings. ” A trigger warning , they wrote , “ serves as a guarantee that students will not experience unexpected discomfort and implies that if they do , a contract has been broken. ” When students come to expect trigger warnings for any material that makes them uncomfortable , the easiest way for faculty to stay out of trouble is to avoid material that might upset the most sensitive student in the class . Magnification , Labeling , and Microaggressions Burns defines magnification as “ exaggerat [ ing ] the importance of things , ” and Leahy , Holland , and McGinn define labeling as “ assign [ ing ] global negative traits to yourself and others. ” The recent collegiate trend of uncovering allegedly racist , sexist , classist , or otherwise discriminatory microaggressions doesn ’ t incidentally teach students to focus on small or accidental slights . Its purpose is to get students to focus on them and then relabel the people who have made such remarks as aggressors .
The term microaggression originated in the 1970s and referred to subtle , often unconscious racist affronts . The definition has expanded in recent years to include anything that can be perceived as discriminatory on virtually any basis . For example , in 2013 , a student group at UCLA staged a sit-in during a class taught by Val Rust , an education professor . The group read a letter aloud expressing their concerns about the campus ’ s hostility toward students of color . Although Rust was not explicitly named , the group quite clearly criticized his teaching as microaggressive . In the course of correcting his students ’ grammar and spelling , Rust had noted that a student had wrongly capitalized the first letter of the word indigenous . Lowercasing the capital I was an insult to the student and her ideology , the group claimed . Even joking about microaggressions can be seen as an aggression , warranting punishment . Last fall , Omar Mahmood , a student at the University of Michigan , wrote a satirical column for a conservative student publication , The Michigan Review , poking fun at what he saw as a campus tendency to perceive microaggressions in just about anything . Mahmood was also employed at the campus newspaper , The Michigan Daily . The Daily ’ s editors said that the way Mahmood had “ satirically mocked the experiences of fellow Daily contributors and minority communities on campus … created a conflict of interest. ” The Daily terminated Mahmood after he described the incident to two Web sites , The College Fix and The Daily Caller . A group of women later vandalized Mahmood ’ s doorway with eggs , hot dogs , gum , and notes with messages such as “ Everyone hates you , you violent prick. ” When speech comes to be seen as a form of violence , vindictive protectiveness can justify a hostile , and perhaps even violent , response .
In March , the student government at Ithaca College , in upstate New York , went so far as to propose the creation of an anonymous microaggression-reporting system . Student sponsors envisioned some form of disciplinary action against “ oppressors ” engaged in belittling speech . One of the sponsors of the program said that while “ not … every instance will require trial or some kind of harsh punishment , ” she wanted the program to be “ record-keeping but with impact. ” Surely people make subtle or thinly veiled racist or sexist remarks on college campuses , and it is right for students to raise questions and initiate discussions about such cases . But the increased focus on microaggressions coupled with the endorsement of emotional reasoning is a formula for a constant state of outrage , even toward well-meaning speakers trying to engage in genuine discussion . What are we doing to our students if we encourage them to develop extra-thin skin in the years just before they leave the cocoon of adult protection and enter the workforce ? Would they not be better prepared to flourish if we taught them to question their own emotional reactions , and to give people the benefit of the doubt ? Teaching Students to Catastrophize and Have Zero Tolerance Burns defines catastrophizing as a kind of magnification that turns “ commonplace negative events into nightmarish monsters. ” Leahy , Holland , and McGinn define it as believing “ that what has happened or will happen ” is “ so awful and unbearable that you won ’ t be able to stand it. ” Requests for trigger warnings involve catastrophizing , but this way of thinking colors other areas of campus thought as well .
Catastrophizing rhetoric about physical danger is employed by campus administrators more commonly than you might think—sometimes , it seems , with cynical ends in mind . For instance , last year administrators at Bergen Community College , in New Jersey , suspended Francis Schmidt , a professor , after he posted a picture of his daughter on his Google+ account . The photo showed her in a yoga pose , wearing a T-shirt that read I will take what is mine with fire & blood , a quote from the HBO show Game of Thrones . Schmidt had filed a grievance against the school about two months earlier after being passed over for a sabbatical . The quote was interpreted as a threat by a campus administrator , who received a notification after Schmidt posted the picture ; it had been sent , automatically , to a whole group of contacts . According to Schmidt , a Bergen security official present at a subsequent meeting between administrators and Schmidt thought the word fire could refer to AK-47s . Then there is the eight-year legal saga at Valdosta State University , in Georgia , where a student was expelled for protesting the construction of a parking garage by posting an allegedly “ threatening ” collage on Facebook . The collage described the proposed structure as a “ memorial ” parking garage—a joke referring to a claim by the university president that the garage would be part of his legacy . The president interpreted the collage as a threat against his life .
It should be no surprise that students are exhibiting similar sensitivity . At the University of Central Florida in 2013 , for example , Hyung-il Jung , an accounting instructor , was suspended after a student reported that Jung had made a threatening comment during a review session . Jung explained to the Orlando Sentinel that the material he was reviewing was difficult , and he ’ d noticed the pained look on students ’ faces , so he made a joke . “ It looks like you guys are being slowly suffocated by these questions , ” he recalled saying . “ Am I on a killing spree or what ? ” After the student reported Jung ’ s comment , a group of nearly 20 others e-mailed the UCF administration explaining that the comment had clearly been made in jest . Nevertheless , UCF suspended Jung from all university duties and demanded that he obtain written certification from a mental-health professional that he was “ not a threat to [ himself ] or to the university community ” before he would be allowed to return to campus . All of these actions teach a common lesson : smart people do , in fact , overreact to innocuous speech , make mountains out of molehills , and seek punishment for anyone whose words make anyone else feel uncomfortable . Mental Filtering and Disinvitation Season As Burns defines it , mental filtering is “ pick [ ing ] out a negative detail in any situation and dwell [ ing ] on it exclusively , thus perceiving that the whole situation is negative. ” Leahy , Holland , and McGinn refer to this as “ negative filtering , ” which they define as “ focus [ ing ] almost exclusively on the negatives and seldom notic [ ing ] the positives. ” When applied to campus life , mental filtering allows for simpleminded demonization .
Students and faculty members in large numbers modeled this cognitive distortion during 2014 ’ s “ disinvitation season. ” That ’ s the time of year—usually early spring—when commencement speakers are announced and when students and professors demand that some of those speakers be disinvited because of things they have said or done . According to data compiled by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education , since 2000 , at least 240 campaigns have been launched at U.S. universities to prevent public figures from appearing at campus events ; most of them have occurred since 2009 . Consider two of the most prominent disinvitation targets of 2014 : former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the International Monetary Fund ’ s managing director , Christine Lagarde . Rice was the first black female secretary of state ; Lagarde was the first woman to become finance minister of a G8 country and the first female head of the IMF . Both speakers could have been seen as highly successful role models for female students , and Rice for minority students as well . But the critics , in effect , discounted any possibility of something positive coming from those speeches . Members of an academic community should of course be free to raise questions about Rice ’ s role in the Iraq War or to look skeptically at the IMF ’ s policies . But should dislike of part of a person ’ s record disqualify her altogether from sharing her perspectives ?","Something strange is happening at America’s colleges and universities. A movement is arising, undirected and driven largely by students, to scrub campuses clean of words, ideas, and subjects that might cause discomfort or give offense. Last December, Jeannie Suk wrote in an online article for The New Yorker about law students asking her fellow professors at Harvard not to teach rape law—or, in one case, even use the word violate (as in “that violates the law”) lest it cause students distress. In February, Laura Kipnis, a professor at Northwestern University, wrote an essay in The Chronicle of Higher Education describing a new campus politics of sexual paranoia—and was then subjected to a long investigation after students who were offended by the article and by a tweet she’d sent filed Title IX complaints against her. In June, a professor protecting himself with a pseudonym wrote an essay for Vox describing how gingerly he now has to teach. “I’m a Liberal Professor, and My Liberal Students Terrify Me,” the headline said. A number of popular comedians, including Chris Rock, have stopped performing on college campuses (see Caitlin Flanagan’s article in this month’s issue). Jerry Seinfeld and Bill Maher have publicly condemned the oversensitivity of college students, saying too many of them can’t take a joke.

Listen to the audio version of this article: Feature stories, read aloud: download the Audm app for your iPhone. Two terms have risen quickly from obscurity into common campus parlance. Microaggressions are small actions or word choices that seem on their face to have no malicious intent but that are thought of as a kind of violence nonetheless. For example, by some campus guidelines, it is a microaggression to ask an Asian American or Latino American “Where were you born?,” because this implies that he or she is not a real American. Trigger warnings are alerts that professors are expected to issue if something in a course might cause a strong emotional response. For example, some students have called for warnings that Chinua Achebe’s Things Fall Apart describes racial violence and that F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby portrays misogyny and physical abuse, so that students who have been previously victimized by racism or domestic violence can choose to avoid these works, which they believe might “trigger” a recurrence of past trauma.

Some recent campus actions border on the surreal. In April, at Brandeis University, the Asian American student association sought to raise awareness of microaggressions against Asians through an installation on the steps of an academic hall. The installation gave examples of microaggressions such as “Aren’t you supposed to be good at math?” and “I’m colorblind! I don’t see race.” But a backlash arose among other Asian American students, who felt that the display itself was a microaggression. The association removed the installation, and its president wrote an e-mail to the entire student body apologizing to anyone who was “triggered or hurt by the content of the microaggressions.” According to the most-basic tenets of psychology, helping people with anxiety disorders avoid the things they fear is misguided. This new climate is slowly being institutionalized, and is affecting what can be said in the classroom, even as a basis for discussion. During the 2014–15 school year, for instance, the deans and department chairs at the 10 University of California system schools were presented by administrators at faculty leader-training sessions with examples of microaggressions. The list of offensive statements included: “America is the land of opportunity” and “I believe the most qualified person should get the job.” Read Follow-Up Notes Haidt and Lukianoff respond to critics

Debating the campus protests over race and free speech The press has typically described these developments as a resurgence of political correctness. That’s partly right, although there are important differences between what’s happening now and what happened in the 1980s and ’90s. That movement sought to restrict speech (specifically hate speech aimed at marginalized groups), but it also challenged the literary, philosophical, and historical canon, seeking to widen it by including more-diverse perspectives. The current movement is largely about emotional well-being. More than the last, it presumes an extraordinary fragility of the collegiate psyche, and therefore elevates the goal of protecting students from psychological harm. The ultimate aim, it seems, is to turn campuses into “safe spaces” where young adults are shielded from words and ideas that make some uncomfortable. And more than the last, this movement seeks to punish anyone who interferes with that aim, even accidentally. You might call this impulse vindictive protectiveness. It is creating a culture in which everyone must think twice before speaking up, lest they face charges of insensitivity, aggression, or worse. We have been studying this development for a while now, with rising alarm. (Greg Lukianoff is a constitutional lawyer and the president and CEO of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, which defends free speech and academic freedom on campus, and has advocated for students and faculty involved in many of the incidents this article describes; Jonathan Haidt is a social psychologist who studies the American culture wars. The stories of how we each came to this subject can be read here.) The dangers that these trends pose to scholarship and to the quality of American universities are significant; we could write a whole essay detailing them. But in this essay we focus on a different question: What are the effects of this new protectiveness on the students themselves? Does it benefit the people it is supposed to help? What exactly are students learning when they spend four years or more in a community that polices unintentional slights, places warning labels on works of classic literature, and in many other ways conveys the sense that words can be forms of violence that require strict control by campus authorities, who are expected to act as both protectors and prosecutors? Power, identity, and speech in the new American university

Read more There’s a saying common in education circles: Don’t teach students what to think; teach them how to think. The idea goes back at least as far as Socrates. Today, what we call the Socratic method is a way of teaching that fosters critical thinking, in part by encouraging students to question their own unexamined beliefs, as well as the received wisdom of those around them. Such questioning sometimes leads to discomfort, and even to anger, on the way to understanding. But vindictive protectiveness teaches students to think in a very different way. It prepares them poorly for professional life, which often demands intellectual engagement with people and ideas one might find uncongenial or wrong. The harm may be more immediate, too. A campus culture devoted to policing speech and punishing speakers is likely to engender patterns of thought that are surprisingly similar to those long identified by cognitive behavioral therapists as causes of depression and anxiety. The new protectiveness may be teaching students to think pathologically.

How Did We Get Here? It’s difficult to know exactly why vindictive protectiveness has burst forth so powerfully in the past few years. The phenomenon may be related to recent changes in the interpretation of federal antidiscrimination statutes (about which more later). But the answer probably involves generational shifts as well. Childhood itself has changed greatly during the past generation. Many Baby Boomers and Gen Xers can remember riding their bicycles around their hometowns, unchaperoned by adults, by the time they were 8 or 9 years old. In the hours after school, kids were expected to occupy themselves, getting into minor scrapes and learning from their experiences. But “free range” childhood became less common in the 1980s. The surge in crime from the ’60s through the early ’90s made Baby Boomer parents more protective than their own parents had been. Stories of abducted children appeared more frequently in the news, and in 1984, images of them began showing up on milk cartons. In response, many parents pulled in the reins and worked harder to keep their children safe. The flight to safety also happened at school. Dangerous play structures were removed from playgrounds; peanut butter was banned from student lunches. After the 1999 Columbine massacre in Colorado, many schools cracked down on bullying, implementing “zero tolerance” policies. In a variety of ways, children born after 1980—the Millennials—got a consistent message from adults: life is dangerous, but adults will do everything in their power to protect you from harm, not just from strangers but from one another as well.

These same children grew up in a culture that was (and still is) becoming more politically polarized. Republicans and Democrats have never particularly liked each other, but survey data going back to the 1970s show that on average, their mutual dislike used to be surprisingly mild. Negative feelings have grown steadily stronger, however, particularly since the early 2000s. Political scientists call this process “affective partisan polarization,” and it is a very serious problem for any democracy. As each side increasingly demonizes the other, compromise becomes more difficult. A recent study shows that implicit or unconscious biases are now at least as strong across political parties as they are across races. So it’s not hard to imagine why students arriving on campus today might be more desirous of protection and more hostile toward ideological opponents than in generations past. This hostility, and the self-righteousness fueled by strong partisan emotions, can be expected to add force to any moral crusade. A principle of moral psychology is that “morality binds and blinds.” Part of what we do when we make moral judgments is express allegiance to a team. But that can interfere with our ability to think critically. Acknowledging that the other side’s viewpoint has any merit is risky—your teammates may see you as a traitor. Social media makes it extraordinarily easy to join crusades, express solidarity and outrage, and shun traitors. Facebook was founded in 2004, and since 2006 it has allowed children as young as 13 to join. This means that the first wave of students who spent all their teen years using Facebook reached college in 2011, and graduated from college only this year. Andrew B. Myers These first true “social-media natives” may be different from members of previous generations in how they go about sharing their moral judgments and supporting one another in moral campaigns and conflicts. We find much to like about these trends; young people today are engaged with one another, with news stories, and with prosocial endeavors to a greater degree than when the dominant technology was television. But social media has also fundamentally shifted the balance of power in relationships between students and faculty; the latter increasingly fear what students might do to their reputations and careers by stirring up online mobs against them.

We do not mean to imply simple causation, but rates of mental illness in young adults have been rising, both on campus and off, in recent decades. Some portion of the increase is surely due to better diagnosis and greater willingness to seek help, but most experts seem to agree that some portion of the trend is real. Nearly all of the campus mental-health directors surveyed in 2013 by the American College Counseling Association reported that the number of students with severe psychological problems was rising at their schools. The rate of emotional distress reported by students themselves is also high, and rising. In a 2014 survey by the American College Health Association, 54 percent of college students surveyed said that they had “felt overwhelming anxiety” in the past 12 months, up from 49 percent in the same survey just five years earlier. Students seem to be reporting more emotional crises; many seem fragile, and this has surely changed the way university faculty and administrators interact with them. The question is whether some of those changes might be doing more harm than good. The Thinking Cure For millennia, philosophers have understood that we don’t see life as it is; we see a version distorted by our hopes, fears, and other attachments. The Buddha said, “Our life is the creation of our mind.” Marcus Aurelius said, “Life itself is but what you deem it.” The quest for wisdom in many traditions begins with this insight. Early Buddhists and the Stoics, for example, developed practices for reducing attachments, thinking more clearly, and finding release from the emotional torments of normal mental life.

Cognitive behavioral therapy is a modern embodiment of this ancient wisdom. It is the most extensively studied nonpharmaceutical treatment of mental illness, and is used widely to treat depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, and addiction. It can even be of help to schizophrenics. No other form of psychotherapy has been shown to work for a broader range of problems. Studies have generally found that it is as effective as antidepressant drugs (such as Prozac) in the treatment of anxiety and depression. The therapy is relatively quick and easy to learn; after a few months of training, many patients can do it on their own. Unlike drugs, cognitive behavioral therapy keeps working long after treatment is stopped, because it teaches thinking skills that people can continue to use. The goal is to minimize distorted thinking and see the world more accurately. You start by learning the names of the dozen or so most common cognitive distortions (such as overgeneralizing, discounting positives, and emotional reasoning; see the list at the bottom of this article). Each time you notice yourself falling prey to one of them, you name it, describe the facts of the situation, consider alternative interpretations, and then choose an interpretation of events more in line with those facts. Your emotions follow your new interpretation. In time, this process becomes automatic. When people improve their mental hygiene in this way—when they free themselves from the repetitive irrational thoughts that had previously filled so much of their consciousness—they become less depressed, anxious, and angry.

The parallel to formal education is clear: cognitive behavioral therapy teaches good critical-thinking skills, the sort that educators have striven for so long to impart. By almost any definition, critical thinking requires grounding one’s beliefs in evidence rather than in emotion or desire, and learning how to search for and evaluate evidence that might contradict one’s initial hypothesis. But does campus life today foster critical thinking? Or does it coax students to think in more-distorted ways? Let’s look at recent trends in higher education in light of the distortions that cognitive behavioral therapy identifies. We will draw the names and descriptions of these distortions from David D. Burns’s popular book Feeling Good, as well as from the second edition of Treatment Plans and Interventions for Depression and Anxiety Disorders, by Robert L. Leahy, Stephen J. F. Holland, and Lata K. McGinn. Higher Education’s Embrace of “Emotional Reasoning” Burns defines emotional reasoning as assuming “that your negative emotions necessarily reflect the way things really are: ‘I feel it, therefore it must be true.’ ” Leahy, Holland, and McGinn define it as letting “your feelings guide your interpretation of reality.” But, of course, subjective feelings are not always trustworthy guides; unrestrained, they can cause people to lash out at others who have done nothing wrong. Therapy often involves talking yourself down from the idea that each of your emotional responses represents something true or important.

Emotional reasoning dominates many campus debates and discussions. A claim that someone’s words are “offensive” is not just an expression of one’s own subjective feeling of offendedness. It is, rather, a public charge that the speaker has done something objectively wrong. It is a demand that the speaker apologize or be punished by some authority for committing an offense. There have always been some people who believe they have a right not to be offended. Yet throughout American history—from the Victorian era to the free-speech activism of the 1960s and ’70s—radicals have pushed boundaries and mocked prevailing sensibilities. Sometime in the 1980s, however, college campuses began to focus on preventing offensive speech, especially speech that might be hurtful to women or minority groups. The sentiment underpinning this goal was laudable, but it quickly produced some absurd results. What are we doing to our students if we encourage them to develop extra-thin skin just before they leave the cocoon of adult protection? Among the most famous early examples was the so-called water-buffalo incident at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1993, the university charged an Israeli-born student with racial harassment after he yelled “Shut up, you water buffalo!” to a crowd of black sorority women that was making noise at night outside his dorm-room window. Many scholars and pundits at the time could not see how the term water buffalo (a rough translation of a Hebrew insult for a thoughtless or rowdy person) was a racial slur against African Americans, and as a result, the case became international news. Claims of a right not to be offended have continued to arise since then, and universities have continued to privilege them. In a particularly egregious 2008 case, for instance, Indiana University–Purdue University at Indianapolis found a white student guilty of racial harassment for reading a book titled Notre Dame vs. the Klan. The book honored student opposition to the Ku Klux Klan when it marched on Notre Dame in 1924. Nonetheless, the picture of a Klan rally on the book’s cover offended at least one of the student’s co-workers (he was a janitor as well as a student), and that was enough for a guilty finding by the university’s Affirmative Action Office.

These examples may seem extreme, but the reasoning behind them has become more commonplace on campus in recent years. Last year, at the University of St. Thomas, in Minnesota, an event called Hump Day, which would have allowed people to pet a camel, was abruptly canceled. Students had created a Facebook group where they protested the event for animal cruelty, for being a waste of money, and for being insensitive to people from the Middle East. The inspiration for the camel had almost certainly come from a popular TV commercial in which a camel saunters around an office on a Wednesday, celebrating “hump day”; it was devoid of any reference to Middle Eastern peoples. Nevertheless, the group organizing the event announced on its Facebook page that the event would be canceled because the “program [was] dividing people and would make for an uncomfortable and possibly unsafe environment.” Because there is a broad ban in academic circles on “blaming the victim,” it is generally considered unacceptable to question the reasonableness (let alone the sincerity) of someone’s emotional state, particularly if those emotions are linked to one’s group identity. The thin argument “I’m offended” becomes an unbeatable trump card. This leads to what Jonathan Rauch, a contributing editor at this magazine, calls the “offendedness sweepstakes,” in which opposing parties use claims of offense as cudgels. In the process, the bar for what we consider unacceptable speech is lowered further and further.

Since 2013, new pressure from the federal government has reinforced this trend. Federal antidiscrimination statutes regulate on-campus harassment and unequal treatment based on sex, race, religion, and national origin. Until recently, the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights acknowledged that speech must be “objectively offensive” before it could be deemed actionable as sexual harassment—it would have to pass the “reasonable person” test. To be prohibited, the office wrote in 2003, allegedly harassing speech would have to go “beyond the mere expression of views, words, symbols or thoughts that some person finds offensive.” But in 2013, the Departments of Justice and Education greatly broadened the definition of sexual harassment to include verbal conduct that is simply “unwelcome.” Out of fear of federal investigations, universities are now applying that standard—defining unwelcome speech as harassment—not just to sex, but to race, religion, and veteran status as well. Everyone is supposed to rely upon his or her own subjective feelings to decide whether a comment by a professor or a fellow student is unwelcome, and therefore grounds for a harassment claim. Emotional reasoning is now accepted as evidence. If our universities are teaching students that their emotions can be used effectively as weapons—or at least as evidence in administrative proceedings—then they are teaching students to nurture a kind of hypersensitivity that will lead them into countless drawn-out conflicts in college and beyond. Schools may be training students in thinking styles that will damage their careers and friendships, along with their mental health.

Fortune-Telling and Trigger Warnings Burns defines fortune-telling as “anticipat[ing] that things will turn out badly” and feeling “convinced that your prediction is an already-established fact.” Leahy, Holland, and McGinn define it as “predict[ing] the future negatively” or seeing potential danger in an everyday situation. The recent spread of demands for trigger warnings on reading assignments with provocative content is an example of fortune-telling. The idea that words (or smells or any sensory input) can trigger searing memories of past trauma—and intense fear that it may be repeated—has been around at least since World War I, when psychiatrists began treating soldiers for what is now called post-traumatic stress disorder. But explicit trigger warnings are believed to have originated much more recently, on message boards in the early days of the Internet. Trigger warnings became particularly prevalent in self-help and feminist forums, where they allowed readers who had suffered from traumatic events like sexual assault to avoid graphic content that might trigger flashbacks or panic attacks. Search-engine trends indicate that the phrase broke into mainstream use online around 2011, spiked in 2014, and reached an all-time high in 2015. The use of trigger warnings on campus appears to have followed a similar trajectory; seemingly overnight, students at universities across the country have begun demanding that their professors issue warnings before covering material that might evoke a negative emotional response.

In 2013, a task force composed of administrators, students, recent alumni, and one faculty member at Oberlin College, in Ohio, released an online resource guide for faculty (subsequently retracted in the face of faculty pushback) that included a list of topics warranting trigger warnings. These topics included classism and privilege, among many others. The task force recommended that materials that might trigger negative reactions among students be avoided altogether unless they “contribute directly” to course goals, and suggested that works that were “too important to avoid” be made optional. It’s hard to imagine how novels illustrating classism and privilege could provoke or reactivate the kind of terror that is typically implicated in PTSD. Rather, trigger warnings are sometimes demanded for a long list of ideas and attitudes that some students find politically offensive, in the name of preventing other students from being harmed. This is an example of what psychologists call “motivated reasoning”—we spontaneously generate arguments for conclusions we want to support. Once you find something hateful, it is easy to argue that exposure to the hateful thing could traumatize some other people. You believe that you know how others will react, and that their reaction could be devastating. Preventing that devastation becomes a moral obligation for the whole community. Books for which students have called publicly for trigger warnings within the past couple of years include Virginia Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway (at Rutgers, for “suicidal inclinations”) and Ovid’s Metamorphoses (at Columbia, for sexual assault).

Jeannie Suk’s New Yorker essay described the difficulties of teaching rape law in the age of trigger warnings. Some students, she wrote, have pressured their professors to avoid teaching the subject in order to protect themselves and their classmates from potential distress. Suk compares this to trying to teach “a medical student who is training to be a surgeon but who fears that he’ll become distressed if he sees or handles blood.” However, there is a deeper problem with trigger warnings. According to the most-basic tenets of psychology, the very idea of helping people with anxiety disorders avoid the things they fear is misguided. A person who is trapped in an elevator during a power outage may panic and think she is going to die. That frightening experience can change neural connections in her amygdala, leading to an elevator phobia. If you want this woman to retain her fear for life, you should help her avoid elevators. But if you want to help her return to normalcy, you should take your cues from Ivan Pavlov and guide her through a process known as exposure therapy. You might start by asking the woman to merely look at an elevator from a distance—standing in a building lobby, perhaps—until her apprehension begins to subside. If nothing bad happens while she’s standing in the lobby—if the fear is not “reinforced”—then she will begin to learn a new association: elevators are not dangerous. (This reduction in fear during exposure is called habituation.) Then, on subsequent days, you might ask her to get closer, and on later days to push the call button, and eventually to step in and go up one floor. This is how the amygdala can get rewired again to associate a previously feared situation with safety or normalcy.

Students who call for trigger warnings may be correct that some of their peers are harboring memories of trauma that could be reactivated by course readings. But they are wrong to try to prevent such reactivations. Students with PTSD should of course get treatment, but they should not try to avoid normal life, with its many opportunities for habituation. Classroom discussions are safe places to be exposed to incidental reminders of trauma (such as the word violate). A discussion of violence is unlikely to be followed by actual violence, so it is a good way to help students change the associations that are causing them discomfort. And they’d better get their habituation done in college, because the world beyond college will be far less willing to accommodate requests for trigger warnings and opt-outs. The expansive use of trigger warnings may also foster unhealthy mental habits in the vastly larger group of students who do not suffer from PTSD or other anxiety disorders. People acquire their fears not just from their own past experiences, but from social learning as well. If everyone around you acts as though something is dangerous—elevators, certain neighborhoods, novels depicting racism—then you are at risk of acquiring that fear too. The psychiatrist Sarah Roff pointed this out last year in an online article for The Chronicle of Higher Education. “One of my biggest concerns about trigger warnings,” Roff wrote, “is that they will apply not just to those who have experienced trauma, but to all students, creating an atmosphere in which they are encouraged to believe that there is something dangerous or damaging about discussing difficult aspects of our history.” The new climate is slowly being institutionalized, and is affecting what can be said in the classroom, even as a basis for discussion or debate. In an article published last year by Inside Higher Ed, seven humanities professors wrote that the trigger-warning movement was “already having a chilling effect on [their] teaching and pedagogy.” They reported their colleagues’ receiving “phone calls from deans and other administrators investigating student complaints that they have included ‘triggering’ material in their courses, with or without warnings.” A trigger warning, they wrote, “serves as a guarantee that students will not experience unexpected discomfort and implies that if they do, a contract has been broken.” When students come to expect trigger warnings for any material that makes them uncomfortable, the easiest way for faculty to stay out of trouble is to avoid material that might upset the most sensitive student in the class. Magnification, Labeling, and Microaggressions Burns defines magnification as “exaggerat[ing] the importance of things,” and Leahy, Holland, and McGinn define labeling as “assign[ing] global negative traits to yourself and others.” The recent collegiate trend of uncovering allegedly racist, sexist, classist, or otherwise discriminatory microaggressions doesn’t incidentally teach students to focus on small or accidental slights. Its purpose is to get students to focus on them and then relabel the people who have made such remarks as aggressors.

The term microaggression originated in the 1970s and referred to subtle, often unconscious racist affronts. The definition has expanded in recent years to include anything that can be perceived as discriminatory on virtually any basis. For example, in 2013, a student group at UCLA staged a sit-in during a class taught by Val Rust, an education professor. The group read a letter aloud expressing their concerns about the campus’s hostility toward students of color. Although Rust was not explicitly named, the group quite clearly criticized his teaching as microaggressive. In the course of correcting his students’ grammar and spelling, Rust had noted that a student had wrongly capitalized the first letter of the word indigenous. Lowercasing the capital I was an insult to the student and her ideology, the group claimed. Even joking about microaggressions can be seen as an aggression, warranting punishment. Last fall, Omar Mahmood, a student at the University of Michigan, wrote a satirical column for a conservative student publication, The Michigan Review, poking fun at what he saw as a campus tendency to perceive microaggressions in just about anything. Mahmood was also employed at the campus newspaper, The Michigan Daily. The Daily’s editors said that the way Mahmood had “satirically mocked the experiences of fellow Daily contributors and minority communities on campus … created a conflict of interest.” The Daily terminated Mahmood after he described the incident to two Web sites, The College Fix and The Daily Caller. A group of women later vandalized Mahmood’s doorway with eggs, hot dogs, gum, and notes with messages such as “Everyone hates you, you violent prick.” When speech comes to be seen as a form of violence, vindictive protectiveness can justify a hostile, and perhaps even violent, response.

In March, the student government at Ithaca College, in upstate New York, went so far as to propose the creation of an anonymous microaggression-reporting system. Student sponsors envisioned some form of disciplinary action against “oppressors” engaged in belittling speech. One of the sponsors of the program said that while “not … every instance will require trial or some kind of harsh punishment,” she wanted the program to be “record-keeping but with impact.” Surely people make subtle or thinly veiled racist or sexist remarks on college campuses, and it is right for students to raise questions and initiate discussions about such cases. But the increased focus on microaggressions coupled with the endorsement of emotional reasoning is a formula for a constant state of outrage, even toward well-meaning speakers trying to engage in genuine discussion. What are we doing to our students if we encourage them to develop extra-thin skin in the years just before they leave the cocoon of adult protection and enter the workforce? Would they not be better prepared to flourish if we taught them to question their own emotional reactions, and to give people the benefit of the doubt? Teaching Students to Catastrophize and Have Zero Tolerance Burns defines catastrophizing as a kind of magnification that turns “commonplace negative events into nightmarish monsters.” Leahy, Holland, and McGinn define it as believing “that what has happened or will happen” is “so awful and unbearable that you won’t be able to stand it.” Requests for trigger warnings involve catastrophizing, but this way of thinking colors other areas of campus thought as well.

Catastrophizing rhetoric about physical danger is employed by campus administrators more commonly than you might think—sometimes, it seems, with cynical ends in mind. For instance, last year administrators at Bergen Community College, in New Jersey, suspended Francis Schmidt, a professor, after he posted a picture of his daughter on his Google+ account. The photo showed her in a yoga pose, wearing a T-shirt that read I will take what is mine with fire & blood, a quote from the HBO show Game of Thrones. Schmidt had filed a grievance against the school about two months earlier after being passed over for a sabbatical. The quote was interpreted as a threat by a campus administrator, who received a notification after Schmidt posted the picture; it had been sent, automatically, to a whole group of contacts. According to Schmidt, a Bergen security official present at a subsequent meeting between administrators and Schmidt thought the word fire could refer to AK-47s. Then there is the eight-year legal saga at Valdosta State University, in Georgia, where a student was expelled for protesting the construction of a parking garage by posting an allegedly “threatening” collage on Facebook. The collage described the proposed structure as a “memorial” parking garage—a joke referring to a claim by the university president that the garage would be part of his legacy. The president interpreted the collage as a threat against his life.

It should be no surprise that students are exhibiting similar sensitivity. At the University of Central Florida in 2013, for example, Hyung-il Jung, an accounting instructor, was suspended after a student reported that Jung had made a threatening comment during a review session. Jung explained to the Orlando Sentinel that the material he was reviewing was difficult, and he’d noticed the pained look on students’ faces, so he made a joke. “It looks like you guys are being slowly suffocated by these questions,” he recalled saying. “Am I on a killing spree or what?” After the student reported Jung’s comment, a group of nearly 20 others e-mailed the UCF administration explaining that the comment had clearly been made in jest. Nevertheless, UCF suspended Jung from all university duties and demanded that he obtain written certification from a mental-health professional that he was “not a threat to [himself] or to the university community” before he would be allowed to return to campus. All of these actions teach a common lesson: smart people do, in fact, overreact to innocuous speech, make mountains out of molehills, and seek punishment for anyone whose words make anyone else feel uncomfortable. Mental Filtering and Disinvitation Season As Burns defines it, mental filtering is “pick[ing] out a negative detail in any situation and dwell[ing] on it exclusively, thus perceiving that the whole situation is negative.” Leahy, Holland, and McGinn refer to this as “negative filtering,” which they define as “focus[ing] almost exclusively on the negatives and seldom notic[ing] the positives.” When applied to campus life, mental filtering allows for simpleminded demonization.

Students and faculty members in large numbers modeled this cognitive distortion during 2014’s “disinvitation season.” That’s the time of year—usually early spring—when commencement speakers are announced and when students and professors demand that some of those speakers be disinvited because of things they have said or done. According to data compiled by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, since 2000, at least 240 campaigns have been launched at U.S. universities to prevent public figures from appearing at campus events; most of them have occurred since 2009. Consider two of the most prominent disinvitation targets of 2014: former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the International Monetary Fund’s managing director, Christine Lagarde. Rice was the first black female secretary of state; Lagarde was the first woman to become finance minister of a G8 country and the first female head of the IMF. Both speakers could have been seen as highly successful role models for female students, and Rice for minority students as well. But the critics, in effect, discounted any possibility of something positive coming from those speeches. Members of an academic community should of course be free to raise questions about Rice’s role in the Iraq War or to look skeptically at the IMF’s policies. But should dislike of part of a person’s record disqualify her altogether from sharing her perspectives?",www.theatlantic.com,left,Lw9iXBDXLdkzKmZf

Last weekend President Trump took aim at the rising trend of censorship on social media platforms. ""Social Media is totally discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices,"" the president Tweeted on Saturday. ""Speaking loudly and clearly for the Trump administration, we won’t let that happen."" He said that ""[c]ensorship is a very dangerous thing,"" and urged social media companies to ""let everybody participate, good & bad, and we will all just have to figure it out!"" Ironically this used to be the position of the ACLU, before it decided to start balancing speech against its possible impact on the progressive agenda.

Most reporting on this topic has focused on the banning of conspiracy-monger Alex Jones from many social media platforms. But the censorship drive goes well beyond Infowars. Conservative author Doug Wead published a detailed analysis showing how Google systematically stifled his content from being available on Youtube and in Google search results. John Hinderaker writes how Google did the same to Dennis Prager and his Prager University videos, and when Prager went to court over it, Facebook piled on and reduced the reach among his 3 million followers to zero. And a confidential memo by Media Matters from 2017 detailing how major social media platforms can collude to eliminate “right-wing propaganda"" and ""fake news” was recently exposed.

Social media has become a public menace

Social media companies say that the people they ban have violated the terms of service, such as engaging in hate speech, or being suspected of being a Russian bot. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey admitted that his company skews leftward, but denies that this has any impact on what content is allowed on the platform. And since these are private companies in theory they should be free to establish whatever content policies they want.

But private companies can become a public menace. It is becoming clearer that these social media platforms are having a corrosive effect on public debate and expression generally. Paradoxically, greater access to information has not led to more informed public discourse. Even with all the world’s information at our fingertips, discussion has gotten coarser, more superficial, more vulgar, and more prone to threats, insults and violence. Social media also pull together and empower radicals of all stripes by making it easier for them to collaborate and pass on their toxic brews.

People who browse through information on their tablets and mobile phones are more likely to respond to histrionic headlines and vivid graphics. Journalists know that dramatic stories get more clicks, which has led to a general decline in temperate reporting and a rise in Jim Acosta-style grandstanding — not to mention lower public trust in the media. And it isn’t just journalists — anyone in the virtual world can zap out thoughtless, angry comments that they might never express in person. If Twitter banned all hateful speech they would probably lose 75 percent of their traffic.

It would be a mistake to look to the government to control the information flow, as some Senate Democrats are discussing. Once we start down that road we could wind up in a situation like China, where the government rates citizens using a system of “social credits” that rewards behavior the state approves of and punishes that which Beijing frowns on. The expression “Facebook jail” could take on a new, more literal meaning.

Government could take action

This doesn’t mean the government has no role to play. The White House could ban these firms from government contracts until they clean up their act. Congress could investigate the threat to privacy social media present through buying and selling personal information. The Justice Department could consider instigating antitrust actions. Compare what Google is doing today to what Microsoft was charged with in the 1990s and the case makes itself.

For conservatives, the answer is to tune out. There are social media alternatives, and there is nothing is stopping people from developing their own networks if they want. It is a fantastic business opportunity. Facebook, Twitter and other such platforms are 100 percent dependent on the users who voluntarily provide information to them. The algorithms that increasingly control your life are your fault. And if people stopped using these services, they would go away.

OK, now try to share this article on Facebook. It has probably already been banned.

In August , Paula Bolyard , a supervising editor at the conservative news outlet PJ Media , published a story reporting that 96 % of Google search results for Donald Trump prioritized “ left-leaning and anti-Trump media outlets ” .
Bolyard ’ s results were generated according to her own admittedly unscientific methodology . She searched for “ Trump ” in Google ’ s News tab , and then used a highly questionable media chart that separated outlets into “ left ” and “ right ” to tabulate the results . She reported that 96 of 100 results returned were from so-called “ left-leaning ” news outlets , with 21 of those from CNN alone . Despite this dubious methodology , Bolyard ’ s statistic spread , and her story was picked up by a Fox Business Network show .
Are Google search results politically biased ? | Jeff Hancock et al Read more
A few days later , Donald Trump tweeted that Google results were “ RIGGED ” against him , citing Bolyard ’ s figure .
Trump was using the statistic to validate speculation that technology companies are encoding anti-conservative bias into the architecture of their businesses . “ Google & others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good , ” he added to his initial tweet .
But by citing Bolyard ’ s anecdotal evidence as reliable data , he inadvertently revealed how the claim of anti-conservative bias is being spread through the media as conspiracy theory rather than verifiable fact .
Since technology companies ensure that their content moderation practices remain undisclosed , there is no way of definitively proving that algorithmic anti-conservative bias exists from the outside . In the absence of evidence , hyper-partisan news outlets like PJ Media , Breitbart , the Daily Caller , and the Washington Examiner foreground stories of Silicon Valley being “ hostile ” towards conservatives – the firing of James Damore and Sergey Brin ’ s anti-Trump comments are favorite examples – and from this , infer a concerted suppression of conservative views through the companies ’ technical infrastructure .
The Creepy Line , a documentary released this year by the director MA Taylor and the former Breitbart editor Peter Schweizer , offers an extended exploration of this argument .
The movie hinges on the research of the psychologist Robert Epstein , who since 2013 has published a number of studies demonstrating how search engines could be used to manipulate political opinion through ordering and filtering search results . Epstein calls this the “ search engine manipulation effect ” .
While Epstein proposes that this effect could theoretically be used for any political agenda , an insidious subtext throughout the movie insinuates that this type of manipulation is explicitly being used in favor of Democrats and liberal causes .
News headlines about anti-conservative bias at big tech companies flash across the screen . The film ’ s narrator , Peter Schweizer , makes provocative statements about how “ these companies have a far deeper agenda than they want to let on ” or how they are “ governments trying to steer us towards some utopia ” . Images of Barack Obama with Mark Zuckerberg and Eric Schmidt suddenly appear as Epstein describes how Google and Facebook could rig an election in favor of one candidate .
Jordan Peterson , the controversial Canadian psychology professor , is given ample screen time to tell the story of how Google supposedly censored him for objecting to gender-neutral terminology . “ When you ’ re powerful enough to change the political landscape , it isn ’ t a question of whether you want to if you can , ” Peterson says . “ It ’ s a question of : convince me that you ’ re not doing it . ”
This collage of impressions builds throughout the documentary to paint a picture of Google and Facebook as liberal silos that are antagonistic to conservative thought . Linking this to Epstein ’ s research implies that this ideology has a direct impact on how information is filtered and moderated .
“ The political leaning of the company usually wouldn ’ t matter to me , ” Taylor , the movie ’ s director , told me . “ No one cares how many Democrats work at Honda . But when you control the ebb and flow of information and have a political leaning that informs whether certain information should be out there or not , that ’ s when bias starts entering the conversation . ”
While the narrative of anti-conservative bias emerges from these right-leaning media sources , it is beginning to hit home with more mainstream audiences . In the past year , several Republican politicians have publicly questioned whether social media platforms skew their algorithms to discriminate against conservatives .
Google , Facebook and Twitter have all emphatically denied any technological anti-conservative bias . While trust in these companies is justifiably low after recent scandals , Ari Ezra Waldman , director of the Innovation Center for Law and Technology at the New York Law School , says that there is “ zero evidence ” to suggest that they ’ re lying . “ The fact that individual conservatives get less play or banned [ from platforms ] is not evidence of a pattern of bias , ” he says . “ Those are anecdotes , and anecdotes do not make a case . ”
For Francesca Tripodi , professor of sociology at James Madison University , anecdotal evidence of anti-conservative bias spreads as fact through the media in part because of a deep misunderstanding of how bias in search engines and content moderation practices work . “ These algorithms are very complex and not at all intuitive , ” she says . “ They weigh things like how many people are linking to an article , what key words appear in the headline , and what specific phrases people are using in their search .
If you search for Donald Trump and receive mostly negative results , Tripodi explains , it isn ’ t because Google executives are censoring pro-Trump voices , but because most Google users are seeking or linking to this particular type of news item . “ In other words , Google is biased but its bias skews towards the type of results people want to see . Search results are kind of like a public opinion poll about what news matters . The company depends on being good at measuring precisely this . If they weren ’ t , we wouldn ’ t keep using their services . ”
Tripodi , who published a report on media manipulation for the New York-based research institute Data & Society , also explains that so-called anti-conservative “ censorship ” on social media can often be explained by random glitches in moderation practices taking place at scale .
This year , the conservative media company PragerU accused YouTube and Facebook of “ deliberate censorship of conservative ideas ” after a number of their videos were taken down . Tripodi reviewed several of the videos and found that there were plausible , non-ideologically motivated explanations for why they were removed .
“ One of the videos began with a woman saying the word ‘ rape ’ . This might ’ ve been picked up by some automated system and then sent for review to a third-party moderator in the Philippines . When you only have three seconds to make a decision about content , you ’ re not questioning whether the video is promoting conservative views , ” she says . “ You ’ re mostly worried about the word ‘ rape ’ . ”
Google , Facebook and other big tech companies have offered similar explanations when accused of anti-conservative bias and censorship , admitting that figuring out how to moderate and filter such enormous amounts of content is , as Jack Dorsey put it , “ a work in progress ” .
“ What we ’ re coming to realize is that these systems are not neutral and often amplify biases , ” Tripodi says . “ But this impacts all of us. ” Indeed , faulty content moderation practices have affected many progressive causes . Activists associated with Black Lives Matter have been banned from platforms for calling out racism and LGBT activists have had videos referencing same-sex marriage filtered off YouTube .
“ A big part of this problem is that these processes are not transparent , ” Tripodi says . “ Maybe if we knew more about why content is promoted , removed , flagged , or demonetized , there would be less room for all of this counterproductive conjecture . ”
In the absence of transparency , the idea of anti-conservative bias thrives .
In September , Alex Jones gatecrashed a congressional hearing where Republicans were questioning tech executives Jack Dorsey and Sheryl Sandberg about political bias on their platforms . Jones was protesting against his recent ban from YouTube and Facebook for spreading hate speech , including the conspiracy theory that the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary shooting had never happened .
“ The real election meddling is by Facebook and Google , ” Jones said . “ They are outright banning people and they are blocking conservatives involved in their own first amendment political speech . ”
As danah boyd explained in a speech given at the Online News Association conference a week after this outburst , Jones ’ s hate speech does not constitute conservative values . But he cynically manipulates the narrative of anti-conservative bias to give his online presence legitimacy under “ the false flag of conservatism ” .
“ It ’ s about using nominal conservatism as a cloak to promote toxic masculinity and white supremacy . It ’ s about extremists using conservatives , ” she said . “ Fundamentally , it ’ s a technique to grab power by gaslighting the public and making reality seem fuzzy . ”
The same tactic has been used by other far-right trolls including Mike Cernovich , Milo Yiannopoulos , and Laura Loomer ( who also interrupted proceedings by beseeching Donald Trump to “ save ” conservatives from social media censorship ) .
The strategy appears to be working . Social media companies have become more hesitant to ban users even if they flagrantly violate their terms of service out of fear of being painted as censors . And there has been an emergence of professed “ alternative ” social media platforms , like Gab , which promote themselves as bastions of free speech and havens for conservatives , while actually serving as a breeding ground for hate speech .

Not all claims of anti-conservative bias are as straightforwardly malicious as Jones and co . When I spoke to Bolyard and Taylor , they both claimed that they were most concerned with how algorithmic bias could destabilize the democratic process . “ No matter who you are , or how you lean politically , or what gender you are , the idea that one day the company can just point at you and say , you ’ re out , you ’ re gone – that ’ s not good for society , ” Taylor told me .
Yet , according to Safiya U Noble , a professor at the University of Southern California ’ s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism , those spreading the narrative of anti-conservative bias without sufficient evidence have a responsibility to understand that their assertions do not exist in a political vacuum . “ I think this is a nuanced issue , ” she told me in an email . “ But the claims about conservative bias don ’ t hold up given the rise of conservative and rightwing political power in modern democracies . ”
Noble ’ s broader point , which is laid out in her book Algorithms of Oppression , is that while all algorithmic systems are embedded with pre-existing social biases , these biases reinforce power and thus work against those who are systemically disenfranchised . She shows , for instance , how Google searches for “ black girls ” return a disproportionately high number of pornographic results .
As Noble explains , unsubstantiated cries of anti-conservative bias distracts from these more pressing forms of algorithmic oppression . “ We have to understand the values at play in these notions of conservative bias , ” Noble says , “ and understand this is nothing more than a red herring . ”","Accusations of encoded anti-conservative prejudice are gaining traction, but experts say the claims are just a red herring

Clinton campaign denies access to pool reporter

The Hillary Clinton campaign denied access to the print pool reporter on Monday, reigniting reporters' longstanding concerns about the campaign's commitment to running an open and transparent campaign.

David Martosko, the U.S. political editor for London's Daily Mail, reported showing up at the campaign's breakfast stop in New Hampshire only to be told that he would not be allowed to pool the day's events. Pool reporters are responsible for sending reports from the trail to the rest of the press corps.

""Your pooler showed up at the Puritan Backroom in Manchester on a rainy New Hampshire morning at 7:45 and was greeted in the parking lot by Meredith Thatcher, a press staffer with the New Hampshire Democratic Party. Thatcher told your pooler that he wasn’t the approved print pool reporter for today’s pooled events,"" Martosko reported in his first pool report. (Note: Thatcher is actually a press staffer for ""Hillary for New Hampshire,"" not the state's Democratic Party.)

""Asked to call her boss, Harrell Kirstein, she did so and then reported: 'So I'm afraid it's a no. You're not on the list.' She said [campaign press secretary] Nick Merrill should be phoned with questions,"" Martosko continued. ""Asked if the print pooler was being prohibited from getting on either of the pool vans, Thatcher replied: 'I'm afraid that's right.' Asked why, she responded: 'All I know is what Harrell has told me. I got an email saying the print pooler would be changed for today. Sorry.'""

Daily Mail spokesperson Sean Walsh said the organization is ""seeking an explanation from the Clinton campaign as to why this occurred as Mr. Martosko was scheduled to be the designated print pool reporter in New Hampshire this morning.""

Secret Service at the main entrance refused to let your pooler in and advised to go in through another entrance near a playground. ... Visiting that doorway, another agent asked for your pooler’s name and outlet, to which the pool replied “David Martosko with The Daily Mail.” A voice from behind the door, whom your pool later learned was the head of Mrs. Clinton's Secret Service detail, was heard saying “Oh. No.” ... The first agent sent your pooler back to the front door, advising that the head of the detail insisted. At the front door again, your pooler was asked to wait while the first agent on duty checked to see if the pool would be admitted. ... The answer: ""No. You can't come in.""

Pooler was advised by that Secret Service agent that he had contacted someone “with the campaign” named “Pollard,” who personally said no, your pooler could not come in. It’s unclear who Pollard is. ... Your pooler asked if he could come inside to use the restroom. The Secret Service agent advised that the area had been swept already, so he should “hit the woods.” ... Pool saw a WMUR-TV truck outside and confirmed with a reporter from a competing local station that there were indeed pool journalist inside from photo and video. ... With a light rain falling, your pooler went back to his rental car to file this report, after counting about 210 cars in the parking lots and on the street. ... Both press pool vans from Manchester were visible outside, along with the now-famous black “Scooby” van and a contingent of New Hampshire state trooper vehicles.

UPDATE (11:27 a.m.): Merrill emails:

""We have been working to create an equitable system, and have had some concerns expressed by foreign outlets about not being a part of the rotation. The journalists who coordinate the pool are in touch with them as are we, and we simply asked that until we can work all of that out that we send an outlet in keeping with previous precedents.""",www.politico.com,left,VQj92EhluJ6pjBnc

PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP'S THREE GREATEST CHALLENGES

The situation with regard to flag burning is exactly where it should be in a Democracy: nearly everyone despises flag burners, but the constitution forbids us from making it a crime.

The Constitution would also forbid President-elect Trump to take away the citizenship of flag burners.

The Supreme Court has not only held that flag burning is constitutionally protected, but also that citizenship cannot be taken away even if a flag burner could be convicted of a crime. Denial of citizenship based on a criminal conviction has been ruled to be unconstitutional.

So President-Elect Trump is wrong on at least two counts: you can’t criminalize flag burning; and you can’t take away the citizenship of flag burners.

As president, Trump may have the power to change the constitutional status of flag burning, by appointing justices who agree with the minority in the most recent 5-4 flag burning decision.

The late Justice Scalia was in the majority in that case, and if his replacement takes the minority view, the Supreme Court may change its decision. That would be a serious mistake, because of respect for precedent and because it would open a slippery slope for denying other basic freedoms of expression.

Candidate Trump would seem content with that, since he advocated changing the libel laws to make it easier to sue his critics. But any such change may boomerang against Trump himself, who uses defamation as a political weapon.

If the constitutional rules were loosened, Trump might be subject to defamation actions for calling people crooked, corrupt and other defamatory epithets. Being president doesn’t immunize the incumbent from being sued for mouthing off against his opponents.

So let’s leave the First Amendment alone. Let flag burners be ridiculed and despised in the court of public opinion. Let’s not make martyrs of them by hauling them before our courts of law.

The First Amendment has served us well for two and a quarter centuries. It has protected extremists both on the right and left. Most Americans, when polled, would prefer to ban speech they dislike: “Free speech for me, but not for thee.”

If Donald Trump had his druthers, he would interpret the First Amendment to protect what he says and does, while at the same time, permitting the government to punish what his critics – and those with whom he disagrees – say and do. But that is not the way freedom operates. Freedom of speech for anyone is freedom of speech for everyone. And denying freedom, of speech to anyone, has the potential of denying it to everyone.

The First Amendment is not broken so let’s not try to fix it. Freedom of expression is a principle that liberals and conservatives alike can and should support. Historically it has always been opposed by extremists on both the right and the left, who have no patience for dissenting points of view.

So President-elect Trump, please withdraw your tweet, develop a thicker skin for criticism, and stop tinkering with our freedom of expression.

free_speech,Reuters,1,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trump-cnn/cnn-sues-white-house-over-revoked-credentials-of-correspondent-idUSKCN1NI1SM,CNN sues White House over revoked credentials of correspondent,2018-11-13,David Shepardson,"WASHINGTON ( ███ ) - A federal judge said he would hold a hearing on Wednesday on CNN ’ s lawsuit against the Trump administration seeking the speedy reinstatement of press credentials for White House correspondent Jim Acosta , a frequent target of President Donald Trump .
In its lawsuit filed on Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Washington , the cable news network said the White House violated the First Amendment right to free speech as well as the due process clause of the Constitution providing fair treatment through judicial process . The network asked for a temporary restraining order .
Sarah Sanders , the White House press secretary , dismissed the action as “ just more grandstanding from CNN , and we will vigorously defend against this lawsuit . ”
U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly on Tuesday ordered the Trump administration to respond to the lawsuit by 11 a.m. ( 1600 GMT ) on Wednesday and he set a hearing for 3:30 p.m. ( 2030 GMT ) that day on the request for a restraining order . Kelly , a former lawyer for the Senate Judiciary Committee , was nominated to the bench by Trump last year .
The White House revoked Acosta ’ s credentials last week in an escalation of the Republican president ’ s attacks on the news media , which he has dubbed the “ enemy of the people . ”
Trump has intensified his criticism of the reporters who cover him , making personal jabs in response to questions he does not like , including those about Special Counsel Robert Mueller ’ s probe of whether his campaign worked with Russia to sway the 2016 presidential election . Trump denies any collusion took place .
CNN , and Acosta in particular , have been regular targets of the president .
The day after the Nov. 6 congressional elections , Trump erupted into anger during a news conference when Acosta questioned him about the Russia probe and a migrant caravan traveling through Mexico .
“ That ’ s enough , that ’ s enough , ” Trump told Acosta last Wednesday , as a White House intern attempted to take the microphone away from the correspondent . “ You are a rude , terrible person . ”
The White House suspended his credentials later that day , with Sanders alleging that Acosta had put his hands on the intern who was trying to take the microphone from him . Videos of the encounter show Acosta pulling back as the intern moved to take the microphone .
“ While the suit is specific to CNN and Acosta , this could have happened to anyone , ” CNN said in a statement . “ If left unchallenged , the actions of the White House would create a dangerous chilling effect for any journalist who covers our elected officials . ”
The lawsuit noted that Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday there “ could be others also . ”
Theodore Boutrous , a lawyer for CNN and Acosta , said the White House was punishing Acosta for the contents of his reporting . “ The White House can not be permitted to cast out and punish reporters with whom it disagrees , ” CNN said in its court filing .
The White House Correspondents Association said revoking Acosta ’ s credentials was a disproportionate reaction to what happened at the news conference .
“ The President of the United States should not be in the business of arbitrarily picking the men and women who cover him , ” it said .
U.S. Representative Jerrold Nadler , who is likely to become the Democratic chairman of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee in January , supported the CNN lawsuit .
“ @ CNN is right to fight back against the cynical , unfair , and authoritarian treatment of @ Acosta for doing his job , ” he said in a Twitter post .","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge said he would hold a hearing on Wednesday on CNN’s lawsuit against the Trump administration seeking the speedy reinstatement of press credentials for White House correspondent Jim Acosta, a frequent target of President Donald Trump.

U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly on Tuesday ordered the Trump administration to respond to the lawsuit by 11 a.m. (1600 GMT) on Wednesday and he set a hearing for 3:30 p.m. (2030 GMT) that day on the request for a restraining order. Kelly, a former lawyer for the Senate Judiciary Committee, was nominated to the bench by Trump last year.

The White House revoked Acosta’s credentials last week in an escalation of the Republican president’s attacks on the news media, which he has dubbed the “enemy of the people.”

Trump has intensified his criticism of the reporters who cover him, making personal jabs in response to questions he does not like, including those about Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of whether his campaign worked with Russia to sway the 2016 presidential election. Trump denies any collusion took place.

CNN, and Acosta in particular, have been regular targets of the president.

The day after the Nov. 6 congressional elections, Trump erupted into anger during a news conference when Acosta questioned him about the Russia probe and a migrant caravan traveling through Mexico.

“That’s enough, that’s enough,” Trump told Acosta last Wednesday, as a White House intern attempted to take the microphone away from the correspondent. “You are a rude, terrible person.”

The White House suspended his credentials later that day, with Sanders alleging that Acosta had put his hands on the intern who was trying to take the microphone from him. Videos of the encounter show Acosta pulling back as the intern moved to take the microphone.

‘COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO ANYONE’

“While the suit is specific to CNN and Acosta, this could have happened to anyone,” CNN said in a statement. “If left unchallenged, the actions of the White House would create a dangerous chilling effect for any journalist who covers our elected officials.”

The lawsuit noted that Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday there “could be others also.”

Theodore Boutrous, a lawyer for CNN and Acosta, said the White House was punishing Acosta for the contents of his reporting. “The White House cannot be permitted to cast out and punish reporters with whom it disagrees,” CNN said in its court filing.

The White House Correspondents Association said revoking Acosta’s credentials was a disproportionate reaction to what happened at the news conference.

“The President of the United States should not be in the business of arbitrarily picking the men and women who cover him,” it said.

U.S. Representative Jerrold Nadler, who is likely to become the Democratic chairman of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee in January, supported the CNN lawsuit.

“@CNN is right to fight back against the cynical, unfair, and authoritarian treatment of @Acosta for doing his job,” he said in a Twitter post.",www.reuters.com,center,bktUUQiWjI4ZMwvb

Writing in response to the trial court ’ s ruling against Trump last year , law professor Greg Dolin compared Twitter to a radio call-in show that is hosting a government official as a guest . The politician has no right to be on the show , the host can send the politician packing at any time , and the host has ultimate control over not only the politician ’ s presence but also any callers ’ speech . In other words , Trump remains on Twitter entirely at Twitter ’ s discretion .
In that circumstance , there is no “ public forum. ” There is instead a public official using a private platform to attempt to amplify his specific message , with the permission of the entity that controls the platform . The court ’ s ruling , in this circumstance , represents government intervention in Twitter ’ s control of its own service . The court is overriding the permissions Twitter gave its own user .
Moreover , the court gives short shrift to Trump ’ s own free-speech rights under the government-speech doctrine . Again , to borrow one of Professor Dolin ’ s analogies , “ If a politician is holding a rally in a park ( a traditional public forum ) , it doesn ’ t follow that he must permit critics to share the stage with him. ” The Twitter thread beneath any tweet can undermine or amplify the president ’ s chosen message . So long as Twitter grants the user the ability to regulate his or her Twitter replies , then that regulation is an integral part of the user ’ s expression .
If , say , Kamala Harris wins the White House and Twitter permits her to use its services to announce that she ’ s forming a committee to study the feasibility of reparations for slavery , does she then have to allow that thread to be hijacked by white nationalists and other vile alt-right voices ? I say no . The Second Circuit says yes .
It ’ s common for social-media users to use phrases like “ my Facebook page ” or “ my Twitter feed. ” Yes , it is “ my ” speech on social media , but it is not my page or my feed . A private company is allowing a public official to use the private company ’ s services to amplify his message . The private company is in legal control , not the public official , and if members of the public don ’ t want to be blocked on a Twitter feed , they should take their objections to Twitter , not to federal court .

Here’s why.

Earlier today the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled unanimously that Donald Trump cannot block Twitter users from following his @realDonaldTrump account. It’s an interesting decision from an ideologically diverse judicial panel that at first glance appears to be a straightforward application of conventional First Amendment law. It’s also wrong. It makes a crucial error that reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of speech on private social-media platforms.

Boiled down to its essence, the court’s reasoning contained two key elements. First, it ruled that Trump’s Twitter account represents an outlet for official communications and interactions that is controlled by President Trump. Second, it found that under these circumstances, Trump’s decision to block users represents impermissible state action undertaken to suppress dissent.

The first element is fundamentally mistaken. By no traditional legal measure of “control” does Trump control his Twitter account. Twitter owns and controls his account, and he has no legal right to wrest control of it from Twitter. The court’s misunderstanding of the platform is made evident by this deeply flawed analysis:

The fact that government control over property is temporary, or that the government does not “own” the property in the sense that it holds title to the property, is not determinative of whether the property is, in fact, sufficiently controlled by the government to make it a forum for First Amendment purposes. See Se. Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U.S. 546, 547‐52 (1975) (holding privately‐owned theater leased to and operated by city was public forum). Temporary control by the government can still be control for First Amendment purposes.

There is no “control” at all, temporary or otherwise. When a politician rents a theater or other private venue, there is typically an exchange of money and a rental agreement that explicitly grants enforceable legal rights to access the property and control others’ access to the property, and — critically — limits the landlord’s power during the course of the rental.

Compare that level of control to the absolute lack of rights the user has under Twitter’s terms of service:

There is no exchange of money, the user has no right to the platform, and Twitter can not only eliminate your access entirely but censor any single tweet. If it chooses, it can even remove Trump’s ability to block, mute, or take any other action. And that’s not all — when you use Twitter, your speech isn’t even purely “your” speech any longer.

By submitting, posting or displaying Content on or through the Services, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display and distribute such Content in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed).

Writing in response to the trial court’s ruling against Trump last year, law professor Greg Dolin compared Twitter to a radio call-in show that is hosting a government official as a guest. The politician has no right to be on the show, the host can send the politician packing at any time, and the host has ultimate control over not only the politician’s presence but also any callers’ speech. In other words, Trump remains on Twitter entirely at Twitter’s discretion.

In that circumstance, there is no “public forum.” There is instead a public official using a private platform to attempt to amplify his specific message, with the permission of the entity that controls the platform. The court’s ruling, in this circumstance, represents government intervention in Twitter’s control of its own service. The court is overriding the permissions Twitter gave its own user.

Moreover, the court gives short shrift to Trump’s own free-speech rights under the government-speech doctrine. Again, to borrow one of Professor Dolin’s analogies, “If a politician is holding a rally in a park (a traditional public forum), it doesn’t follow that he must permit critics to share the stage with him.” The Twitter thread beneath any tweet can undermine or amplify the president’s chosen message. So long as Twitter grants the user the ability to regulate his or her Twitter replies, then that regulation is an integral part of the user’s expression.

If, say, Kamala Harris wins the White House and Twitter permits her to use its services to announce that she’s forming a committee to study the feasibility of reparations for slavery, does she then have to allow that thread to be hijacked by white nationalists and other vile alt-right voices? I say no. The Second Circuit says yes.

It’s common for social-media users to use phrases like “my Facebook page” or “my Twitter feed.” Yes, it is “my” speech on social media, but it is not my page or my feed. A private company is allowing a public official to use the private company’s services to amplify his message. The private company is in legal control, not the public official, and if members of the public don’t want to be blocked on a Twitter feed, they should take their objections to Twitter, not to federal court.

For Americans, freedom of speech has always been among our most cherished freedoms. Why? Because free speech and a free press provide a guardrail for all of our other freedoms. Free speech keeps us informed and connected, and it lets us hold our government accountable. Our commitment to free speech is the envy and example of the world. Yet, each generation faces a renewed struggle to preserve that freedom. Today, we’re seeing that struggle, especially in our government’s attempts to censor the Internet.

The regulatory threats to Internet freedom in America are getting more serious. True, Congress finally shelved two highly controversial bills, the Stop Online Piracy Act and the Protect Intellectual Property Act, in 2012. More recently, Congress dropped the Cyber Information Sharing and Protection Act. Yet, already they are starting to work on similar legislation. The main intention behind each of these bills may be good — to protect against online piracy and cyberattacks — but they all give government far too much control over what can and cannot be said online, opening the door to greater restrictions. Censorship is not the way to fight piracy or protect against threats to security or privacy.

Free speech is a fundamental American right. The First Amendment to the Constitution states, “Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.” This includes speaking or writing in public or private, in books, newspapers and certainly on the Internet. We have a duty to protect and preserve this freedom for ourselves and our children. This year, my organization, the Consumer Electronics Association, is co-sponsoring Free Speech Week. This week serves as a reminder to all of us about the importance of free speech.

First Amendment protections also encourage innovation. As many innovations threaten existing business models, free speech ensures that government efforts to squelch innovation can and will be exposed by the press. Moreover, the First Amendment combined with other constitutional protections, such as due process, protect new businesses targeted by threatened old businesses.

An uncensored Internet is a critical indicator of a nation’s commitment to free speech and a tool to keep that freedom alive. Sadly, around the world there are still many nations that do not enjoy free speech, and many governments jealously censor the Internet to make sure people aren’t saying or reading anything considered dangerous or unacceptable. Unsurprisingly, North Korea, China and Iran are among the worst offenders in blocking their citizens’ access to the Internet.

Still, the problem of censoring the Internet is widespread around the world. According to a report released by the independent watchdog Freedom House, “Freedom on the Net 2013,” global Internet freedom has been in decline for the past three years. This isn’t just the case in nations under authoritarian governments, either. America’s rating worsened by five points this year, to 17 on a scale of zero to 100, with zero being completely free.

Keeping America’s Internet uncensored is vital to protect and perpetuate free speech. The Internet creates a platform for individuals to express themselves and say what’s on their minds. It brings people together from across the globe, allowing them to unite with like-minded individuals and to converse openly with people they may not agree with. Additionally, the Internet allows people to organize and act in defense of their freedoms and the issues they care about.

One of the most important aspects of an uncensored Internet is that it lets people hold their government accountable.

These same governments have a track record of punishing — and even killing — their citizens for speaking out online. Authoritarian regimes are afraid to hear criticism, so they silence it. They also monitor content and block anything they consider offensive instead of letting people make decisions for themselves.

That kind of censorship happens in nations that are not free. It should never be allowed to happen in America. If we want to hold on to our prized tradition of free speech, we have to ensure that our Internet remains uncensored and free. We have to speak out ourselves and teach others to do the same. As we celebrate Free Speech Week, let’s remember that we have the right to free speech in America because we fought for it, and we must remain vigilant if we want to protect and keep it for future generations.

Collins","Americans may take free speech for granted , but they couldn ’ t do so a century ago . Courts convicted newspapermen , pamphleteers and politicians for nothing more—and sometimes less—than trying to sway the public against U.S. involvement in World War I . On Nov. 10 , 1919 , the Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of antiwar protesters under a law that made it a crime to “ hinder ” the war effort . But a dissent in Abrams v. U.S. laid the foundation for today ’ s robust protection of controversial speech .
The idea that speech could pose a “ clear and present danger ” to the government , and thus lacked First Amendment protection , came from a quartet of 1919 cases , three of which were unanimous . In March , in Schenck v. U.S. , the court , led by archprogressive Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. , upheld the convictions of pamphleteers who encouraged draft-dodging . A week later , Frohwerk v. U.S. upheld the conviction of a newspaperman who criticized U.S. involvement in foreign wars , while Debs v. U.S. affirmed the conviction of Socialist Party leader Eugene Debs for denouncing the war in a speech . ( Debs went on to receive 3.4 % of the 1920 presidential vote from prison . )
In October the court in Abrams upheld another antiwar protest conviction—but this time not unanimously . Like Charles Schenck , Jacob Abrams was a socialist who had distributed antiwar pamphlets . His group criticized U.S. military support for the anti-Communist White movement in the Russian Civil War . As socialists of the time often did , the pamphleteers urged a general strike in New York , on grounds that workers were making weapons to use against their Bolshevik comrades .
But those same weapons had an alternative—and likelier—use in the allied war effort against the Germans . The defendants were convicted under the Sedition Act of 1918 , which made it a crime to “ urge , incite , or advocate any curtailment of production . . . with intent by such curtailment to cripple or hinder . . . the prosecution of the war . ”
The court affirmed the convictions over the surprising dissent of Schenck ’ s author , Holmes , joined by Justice Louis Brandeis . It ’ s unclear why Holmes put aside his majoritarian impulses to support a constitutional restriction on legislative action . Some scholars have posited that Holmes acted not out of a commitment to the Constitution but because of the disparate impact of speech restrictions on progressive icons . Even so , the dissent is steeped in libertarian ideas . It draws implicitly on John Stuart Mill and asserts that “ the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market . ”
Abrams and the other cases were effectively overturned in Brandenburg v. Ohio ( 1969 ) , which held that speech can be prosecuted only if intended to foment “ imminent lawless action. ” Since then , the court has vigorously defended speech that offends or provokes , ranging from the publication of the Pentagon Papers , to violent rap lyrics , from pornographic humor to burning the American flag .
These strong protections give Americans confidence in our right to express and hear unpopular opinions . The experience of a century ago should warn us against being complacent about it .

These strong protections give Americans confidence in our right to express and hear unpopular opinions. The experience of a century ago should warn us against being complacent about it.

Tens of thousands of anti-racism protesters have opposed the ""Free Speech"" rally in the US city of Boston that featured right-wing speakers.

The rally on Boston Common, which attracted only a small crowd, disbanded early and the participants were escorted out by police.

The organisers had said they would not give a platform to racism or bigotry.

Tensions are high after violent demonstrations in Charlottesville, Virginia last weekend turned deadly.

The Boston Herald reported that up to 30,000 people attended the protest. Demonstrators had gathered at a Boston sports centre and then marched en masse to the common.

Those at the conservative rally were confined to the bandstand area on Boston Common. Crowds of anti-racism protesters surrounded the bandstand but were kept some distance away.

Hundreds of police were deployed and clashes broke out later between some police and anti-rally protesters.

For real news, you can only rely on Trump.

Trump mentioned well-documented terrorist attacks in Europe alongside an apparently sinister occurrence we had not heard about — in Sweden. ""We've got to keep our country safe.

They’re having problems like they never thought possible.”

What happened in Sweden? Something terrible. So terrible those lying Swedes deny anything happened at all.

San Francisco Cops Literally Raided a Reporter's Home.,2019-05-31,"Steven Greenhut, Scott Shackford, David Post, Josh Blackman, Shikha Dalmia, Jacob Sullum, Elizabeth Nolan Brown, Eric Boehm, Ilya Somin, Mike Riggs","Reporters have long denounced Donald Trump 's `` war on journalists '' given the president 's routine Twitter attacks about `` fake news , '' his kind words about authoritarian rulers who have abused the media , and his idea to `` open '' libel laws so politicians can more easily sue publications . He praised a congressional candidate accused of assaulting a reporter . `` Any guy who can do a body slam—he 's my kind of guy , '' Trump said at a 2018 Montana rally .
`` In Donald Trump 's America , the mere act of reporting news unflattering to the president is held up as evidence of bias , '' intoned a 2017 Los Angeles Times editorial . `` Journalists are slandered as 'enemies of the people . ' '' The American Prospect complained last October that `` the president is dehumanizing journalists on the campaign trail and priming his base for more assaults on the First Amendment . ''
As a journalist , I 'm likewise disgusted by Trump 's words and believe they could incite his angriest supporters . He 's playing with fire , but the president has n't actually done anything to abridge press freedom , even if we fear what he might like to do . It 's all words and bluster . Frankly , those concerned about this `` war '' should hope that Trump does n't take lessons from several disturbing recent actions against reporters here in California .
The latest example came in Democratic San Francisco , but the scene is n't particularly uplifting of the city 's oft-touted liberal values . After the unexpected death of the city 's elected public defender , Jeff Adachi , a freelance reporter secured a copy of the related police report and apparently sold the information—some of it pretty salacious—to news outlets . The San Francisco Police Department wants to find the source of the leak .
`` Police used a sledgehammer to try to get into ( the reporter 's ) home and office and cuffed him for hours as they searched and subsequently removed dozens of cameras , cellphones , computers and other equipment used to gather news , '' the Associated Press reported . Police are trying to figure out his role in getting the report . The AP notes that it 's not illegal for reporters to receive or publish information , even if it were improperly obtained by a third party . Police reports are supposed to be public records .
This is a heavy-handed approach to a leaked document . `` The impact of trying to criminalize disclosure of public records , whether or not it violated internal policy or practice , will have a profound effect on public employees ' willingness to disclose public records , '' said attorney Duffy Carolan , quoted by AP . This is more chilling of free speech than some ill-tempered presidential tweets .
I 'm not the first person to notice the irony . In his recent column , CALmatters ' Dan Walters noted that if something similar happened at the federal level , `` Democratic politicians and civil libertarians would erupt in outrage at a heavy-handed government act intended to discourage journalists from delving into areas that officialdom considered off-limits . '' Indeed . There has been criticism , but nothing compared to the `` Trump 's war on journalists '' rhetoric . What gives ?
Walters also pointed to an ongoing case that , in my estimation , is far more disturbing than the San Francisco raid . Early in the year , reporters from UC Berkeley 's Investigative Reporting Program made a public-records request to the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training for a list of the 12,000 California police officers , police applicants and former officers who were convicted of crimes , many of them serious . POST did the right thing and provided the records .
When California Attorney General Xavier Becerra found out , he threatened to criminally prosecute the reporters unless they destroy records that were provided by a public agency . Becerra claims the information is confidential even though it involves public records about official verdicts . And to reiterate , state law forbids prosecution of reporters merely for receiving records—and they received the info from an agency within Becerra 's own department .
U.S. Attorney General William Barr has been accused of behaving like Trump 's personal attorney rather than an impartial top cop regarding the Mueller report . But Becerra makes Barr look like a font of impartiality by contrast . A close ally of police unions , Becerra is shielding records that are uncomfortable to police even though the records protect public safety . Should n't you get to know if the cop pulling over your wife on a dark highway has a rap sheet ?
Beyond threatening to prosecute reporters , Becerra has refused to fully comply with a new law that requires the release of police disciplinary records . Becerra does n't attack the media with words , of course , but his actions speaker loudly . This is n't anything new , either .
Becerra has pursued criminal charges against reporters who produced embarrassing undercover videos of Planned Parenthood back in 2015 . The Times , which criticized the reporters ' message and methods , nevertheless called the prosecutions a `` disturbing overreach . '' But there 's too-little coverage of that situation . There 's no defense of President Trump 's most vile anti-media rhetoric , but we should be even more upset at actions that are much worse .
This column was first published in the Orange County Register .","Reporters have long denounced Donald Trump's ""war on journalists"" given the president's routine Twitter attacks about ""fake news,"" his kind words about authoritarian rulers who have abused the media, and his idea to ""open"" libel laws so politicians can more easily sue publications.

The American Prospect complained last October that ""the president is dehumanizing journalists on the campaign trail and priming his base for more assaults on the First Amendment.""

As a journalist, I'm likewise disgusted by Trump's words and believe they could incite his angriest supporters. He's playing with fire, but the president hasn't actually done anything to abridge press freedom, even if we fear what he might like to do. It's all words and bluster. Frankly, those concerned about this ""war"" should hope that Trump doesn't take lessons from several disturbing recent actions against reporters here in California.

The latest example came in Democratic San Francisco, but the scene isn't particularly uplifting of the city's oft-touted liberal values. After the unexpected death of the city's elected public defender, Jeff Adachi, a freelance reporter secured a copy of the related police report and apparently sold the information—some of it pretty salacious—to news outlets. The San Francisco Police Department wants to find the source of the leak.

""Police used a sledgehammer to try to get into (the reporter's) home and office and cuffed him for hours as they searched and subsequently removed dozens of cameras, cellphones, computers and other equipment used to gather news,"" the Associated Press reported. Police are trying to figure out his role in getting the report. The AP notes that it's not illegal for reporters to receive or publish information, even if it were improperly obtained by a third party. Police reports are supposed to be public records.

This is a heavy-handed approach to a leaked document. ""The impact of trying to criminalize disclosure of public records, whether or not it violated internal policy or practice, will have a profound effect on public employees' willingness to disclose public records,"" said attorney Duffy Carolan, quoted by AP. This is more chilling of free speech than some ill-tempered presidential tweets.

I'm not the first person to notice the irony. In his recent column, CALmatters' Dan Walters noted that if something similar happened at the federal level, ""Democratic politicians and civil libertarians would erupt in outrage at a heavy-handed government act intended to discourage journalists from delving into areas that officialdom considered off-limits."" Indeed. There has been criticism, but nothing compared to the ""Trump's war on journalists"" rhetoric. What gives?

Walters also pointed to an ongoing case that, in my estimation, is far more disturbing than the San Francisco raid. Early in the year, reporters from UC Berkeley's Investigative Reporting Program made a public-records request to the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training for a list of the 12,000 California police officers, police applicants and former officers who were convicted of crimes, many of them serious. POST did the right thing and provided the records.

When California Attorney General Xavier Becerra found out, he threatened to criminally prosecute the reporters unless they destroy records that were provided by a public agency. Becerra claims the information is confidential even though it involves public records about official verdicts. And to reiterate, state law forbids prosecution of reporters merely for receiving records—and they received the info from an agency within Becerra's own department.

U.S. Attorney General William Barr has been accused of behaving like Trump's personal attorney rather than an impartial top cop regarding the Mueller report. But Becerra makes Barr look like a font of impartiality by contrast. A close ally of police unions, Becerra is shielding records that are uncomfortable to police even though the records protect public safety. Shouldn't you get to know if the cop pulling over your wife on a dark highway has a rap sheet?

Beyond threatening to prosecute reporters, Becerra has refused to fully comply with a new law that requires the release of police disciplinary records. Becerra doesn't attack the media with words, of course, but his actions speaker loudly. This isn't anything new, either.

Becerra has pursued criminal charges against reporters who produced embarrassing undercover videos of Planned Parenthood back in 2015. The Times, which criticized the reporters' message and methods, nevertheless called the prosecutions a ""disturbing overreach."" But there's too-little coverage of that situation. There's no defense of President Trump's most vile anti-media rhetoric, but we should be even more upset at actions that are much worse.

''
Allison Stanger , a Middlebury political science professor and a known Democrat , wrote on Facebook days later that she viewed her appearance with Murray — author of `` The Bell Curve '' — as `` a chance to demonstrate publicly my commitment to a free and fair exchange of views in my classroom . ''
That apparently is more than can be said for some of her faculty colleagues , whom Stanger revealed had already judged `` Murray ’ s work and character '' before the event `` while openly admitting that they had not read anything he had written . ''
Stanger went on to describe what she witnessed from the stage Thursday :
I want you to know what it feels like to look out at a sea of students yelling obscenities at other members of my beloved community . There were students and faculty who wanted to hear the exchange , but were unable to do so , either because of the screaming and chanting and chair-pounding in the room , or because their seats were occupied by those who refused to listen , and they were stranded outside the doors . I saw some of my faculty colleagues who had publicly acknowledged that they had not read anything Dr. Murray had written join the effort to shut down the lecture . All of this was deeply unsettling to me . What alarmed me most , however , was what I saw in student eyes from up on that stage . Those who wanted the event to take place made eye contact with me . Those intent on disrupting it steadfastly refused to do so . It was clear to me that they had effectively dehumanized me . They couldn ’ t look me in the eye , because if they had , they would have seen another human being . There is a lot to be angry about in America today , but nothing good ever comes from demonizing our brothers and sisters .
Stanger and Murray eventually exited the venue and livestreamed their Q & A from a private location — a contingency plan agreed upon ahead of time in case things got out of control . You can even faintly hear protesters still shouting outside the new venue in the video of their talk .

But when Stanger and Murray exited the room , protesters were ready for them .
`` We confronted an angry mob as we tried to exit the building , '' Stanger wrote . `` Most of the hatred was focused on Dr. Murray , but when I took his right arm both to shield him from attack and to make sure we stayed together so I could reach the car too , that ’ s when the hatred turned on me . ''
Stanger said that a `` thug grabbed me by the hair and another shoved me in a different direction . I noticed signs with expletives and my name on them . ... For those of you who marched in Washington the day after the inauguration , imagine being in a crowd like that , only being surrounded by hatred rather than love . I feared for my life . ''
Murray also wrote about the experience , noting the mob attack came despite the presence of `` two large and capable security guards . '' Seems that among the mob `` a big man with a sign was standing right in front of us and wasn ’ t going to let us pass , '' Murray said . Their only option ? Walking right toward the guy as a security guard `` pushed him aside , '' he recalled .
`` The three of us got to the car , with the security guards keeping protesters away while we closed and locked the doors , '' Murray said . `` Then we found that the evening wasn ’ t over . So many protesters surrounded the car , banging on the sides and the windows and rocking the car , climbing onto the hood . ''
They actually had to take a `` decoy route '' to their post-event dinner , Stanger wrote , adding she told a colleague she `` felt proud of myself for not having slugged someone . '' But the respite was short-lived . Stanger said they were told the protesters knew where they were and that they should leave .
`` We raced back to the car , driving over the curb and sidewalk to escape quickly , '' Stanger recalled . `` It was then we decided that it was probably best to leave town . ''
After all was said and done , Stanger needed a trip to the emergency room and was diagnosed with a concussion .
`` This was the saddest day of my life , '' she added .
A college ’ s faculty is the obvious resource for keeping the bubble translucent and the intellectual thugs from taking over . A faculty that is overwhelmingly on the side of free intellectual exchange , stipulating only that it be conducted with logic , evidence , and civility , can easily lead each new freshman class to understand that ’ s how academia operates . If faculty members routinely condemn intellectual thuggery , the majority of students who also oppose it will feel entitled to say “ sit down and shut up , we want to hear what he has to say ” when protesters try to shut down intellectual exchange . That leads me to two critical questions for which I have no empirical answers : What is the percentage of tenured faculty on American campuses who are still unambiguously on the side of free intellectual exchange ? What is the percentage of them who are willing to express that position openly ? I am confident that the answer to the first question is still far greater than fifty percent . But what about the answer to the second question ? My reading of events on campuses over the last few years is that a minority of faculty are cowing a majority in the same way that a minority of students are cowing the majority .
Peter Beinart , a journalism and political science professor at City University of New York — and a liberal — wrote a piece for The Atlantic condemning the Middlebury incident , saying it `` suggests that something has gone badly wrong on the campus left . ''
Beinart observed that liberals who are actively shutting down free speech may find themselves silenced one day , too :
Liberals may be tempted to ignore these incidents , either because they are uncomfortable appearing to defend Charles Murray , or because , in the age of Donald Trump , they ’ re worried about bigger things . That would be a mistake . If what happened at Berkeley , and now at Middlebury , goes unchallenged , sooner or later , liberals will get shouted down too . To many on the campus left , after all , Zionism is a racist ideology . Drone attacks constitute war crimes . Barack Obama was the deporter-in-chief . Hillary Clinton supported a racist crime bill . Joe Biden disrespected Anita Hill . There will always be justifications .
Middlebury College President Laurie Patton said Monday the school `` will follow a process of determining a course of action for each individual understood to be involved in some way in the events of last Thursday '' and Middlebury police `` will investigate the confrontation '' after the livestream , which `` we believe involved individuals from both on and off campus . ''
Here 's a lengthy clip of the event that was eventually shut down . The fun really starts just after the 19-minute mark . ( Content warning : Rough language , from mouths and on signs ) :","After a student protest at Vermont's Middlebury College managed to shut down an event last week featuring conservative writer Charles Murray, a liberal professor who had agreed to engage Murray onstage described the ""hatred"" unleashed upon her by protesting students, how she feared for her life — and that the incident is ""a metaphor for what is wrong with our country.""

More from Murray:

A college’s faculty is the obvious resource for keeping the bubble translucent and the intellectual thugs from taking over. A faculty that is overwhelmingly on the side of free intellectual exchange, stipulating only that it be conducted with logic, evidence, and civility, can easily lead each new freshman class to understand that’s how academia operates. If faculty members routinely condemn intellectual thuggery, the majority of students who also oppose it will feel entitled to say “sit down and shut up, we want to hear what he has to say” when protesters try to shut down intellectual exchange. That leads me to two critical questions for which I have no empirical answers: What is the percentage of tenured faculty on American campuses who are still unambiguously on the side of free intellectual exchange? What is the percentage of them who are willing to express that position openly? I am confident that the answer to the first question is still far greater than fifty percent. But what about the answer to the second question?

Peter Beinart, a journalism and political science professor at City University of New York — and a liberal — wrote a piece for The Atlantic condemning the Middlebury incident, saying it ""suggests that something has gone badly wrong on the campus left.""

Beinart observed that liberals who are actively shutting down free speech may find themselves silenced one day, too:

Liberals may be tempted to ignore these incidents, either because they are uncomfortable appearing to defend Charles Murray, or because, in the age of Donald Trump, they’re worried about bigger things. That would be a mistake. If what happened at Berkeley, and now at Middlebury, goes unchallenged, sooner or later, liberals will get shouted down too. To many on the campus left, after all, Zionism is a racist ideology. Drone attacks constitute war crimes. Barack Obama was the deporter-in-chief. Hillary Clinton supported a racist crime bill. Joe Biden disrespected Anita Hill. There will always be justifications.

free_speech,National Review,2,http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/455205/fake-news-real-censorship,"Fake News, Real Sensorship.",2018-01-05,"Andrew Stuttaford, David French, Jordan Sillars, Jay Nordlinger, Kevin D. Williamson, Victor Davis Hanson, Jonah Goldberg, Yuval Levin","There is little over the Atlantic that bears much of a resemblance to the First Amendment , an absence ( envied , sadly , by quite a few over here ) that has often been exploited by a European political establishment that shows every sign of willingness to exploit the often deliberately exaggerated fear of ‘ fake news ’ , a phenomenon—such as it is—far more healthily tackled by argument than by a gag , as a new excuse for shutting down speech of which it disapproves .
Here ’ s France ’ s President Macron , a defender , we are often told , of Europe ’ s liberal order .
In his new year ’ s speech to journalists at the Élysée palace , Macron said he would shortly present the new law in order to fight the spread of fake news , which he said threatened liberal democracies… . For fake news published during election seasons , an emergency legal action could allow authorities to remove that content or even block the website , Macron said . “ If we want to protect liberal democracies , we must be strong and have clear rules , ” he added .
Quite who decides what is—or is not—fake news is an interesting question : Quis custodiet ipsos custodes and all that .
What makes it even more ‘ interesting ’ is the notion that news defined as fake should be suppressed with particular speed during an election campaign that may be over before the decision of the relevant authorities—whoever they may be—can be subjected to proper review . That could be…convenient .
“ Only authoritarian regimes try to control what the truth is , ” said senior conservative senator Bruno Retailleau . Freedom of expression carries risks , but that ’ s better “ than the temptation to control minds , ” he said .
The same Reuters report also notes that the EU Commission is looking at how to deal with fake news . Writing in Euractiv , Aline Robert and Catherine Stupp argue that Macron ’ s speech might encourage the Brussels bureaucracy to propose tougher measures than might otherwise have been the case .
A German satirical magazine ’ s Twitter account was blocked after it parodied anti-Muslim comments , the publication said on Wednesday , in what the national journalists association said showed the downside of a new law against online hate speech . Titanic magazine was mocking Beatrix von Storch , a member of the right-wing Alternative for Germany ( AfD ) party , who accused police of trying “ to appease the barbaric , Muslim , rapist hordes of men ” by putting out a tweet in Arabic . Twitter briefly suspended her account and prosecutors are examining if her comments amount to incitement to hatred . Titanic magazine published its send-up late on Tuesday , in a tweet purporting to be from von Storch to the police , saying : “ The last thing that I want is mollified barbarian , Muslim , gang-raping hordes of men. ” Titanic said on Wednesday its Twitter account had been blocked over the message , which it assumed was a result of a law that came into full force on Jan. 1 that can impose fines of up to 50 million euros ( $ 60 million ) on social media sites that fail to remove hate speech [ and fake news ] promptly . “ We are shocked , ” Titanic editor Tim Wolff said on the magazine ’ s website , adding that Chancellor Angela Merkel and Justice Minister Heiko Maas had promised that the new law would not have this kind of effect .
If Wolff was truly shocked , he is truly naïve . Merkel , another ( supposed ) champion of ‘ liberal ’ values , has been Germany ’ s Chancellor since 2005 . That ’ s long enough for anyone paying any attention to realize that she is reflexively authoritarian and , when it suits her , less than honest .
As for von Storch ’ s comments about the tweet , DW gives some context here :
The Cologne police tweeted New Year ’ s greetings and linked to information on celebrating safely in a series of messages in German and other languages , including Arabic . Cologne was the scene two years ago of mass sexual assaults on New Year ’ s Eve in which most of the suspects were described as young men of North African and Arab origin . “ What the hell is happening in this country ? Why is an official police site tweeting in Arabic ? Do you think it is to appease the barbaric , gang-raping hordes of Muslim men ? ” wrote Beatrix von Storch , the deputy leader of the AfD ’ s parliamentary group . The tweet was later deleted after Twitter froze von Storch ’ s account and informed her she had violated hate speech rules . Her account was shut down for 12 hours . The Cologne police said on Monday that they had filed a criminal complaint against von Storch for hate speech .
Whatever one might think about von Storch ’ s comments , which read to me ( and I ’ m not exactly a fan of Merkel ’ s immigration policies ) as a harsh and intemperate response to a well-intentioned gesture by the police , she is the deputy leader of the AfD ’ s parliamentary group . And the AfD is no longer just a party of the fringe . Given an enormous boost both by Merkel ’ s Willkommenspolitik and the attempts by the media and political establishments to stifle criticism of the approach that the Chancellor had taken , the AfD secured nearly 13 percent of the vote in Germany ’ s recent elections . There is thus something particularly unsettling about von Storch ’ s ( brief ) silencing on Twitter , and something infinitely more sinister ( and , probably counter-productive – more on that later ) about the filing of a police complaint .
So far as Twitter is concerned , it ’ s understandable enough why the company did what it did . To be sure , Twitter is less even-handed in its approach to free speech than it pretends , but it ’ s hard to imagine that its decision will not have been influenced by the prospect of a massive fine should it have contravened Germany ’ s new censorship laws , laws so broadly drawn that even the UN was concerned .
“ Many of the violations covered by the bill are highly dependent on context , context which platforms are in no position to assess , ” the U.N. Special Rapporteur to the High Commissioner for Human Rights David Kaye wrote of the law in the run up to its passage .
The Association of German Journalists ( DJV ) said the Twitter move [ against Titanic ] amounted to censorship , adding it had warned of this danger when the law was drawn up last year . “ A private company based in the United States decides the boundaries of freedom of the press and opinion in Germany , ” DJV Chairman Frank Ueberall said in a statement , calling on parliament to reverse the hate speech law . Twitter , Facebook and other social media platforms are scrambling to adapt to the law , and its implementation is being closely watched after warnings that the threat of fines could prompt websites to block more content than necessary . Germany has some of the world ’ s toughest laws on defamation , incitement to commit crimes and threats of violence , with prison sentences for Holocaust denial or inciting hatred against minorities . Merkel ’ s conservatives accused the AfD of undermining the post-war democratic consensus in Germany . “ The racism that AfD lawmakers have been tweeting for days is intentionally violating , with criminal intent , the basic consensus which democrats have built up since 1949 despite all disagreements , ” Armin Laschet , party deputy of Merkel ’ s Christian Democrats , tweeted . “ By doing this , they want to pave the way to a totally different republic . ”
No-one should need reminding of Germany ’ s terrible history ( to which , it may be unfair to note , von Storch has an unsettling family connection ) and the circumstances that gave birth to the postwar republic ’ s attitude to free speech .
Created in 1949 , the West German federal constitution , also known as the Basic Law or Grundgesetz , contained a central paradox . Many West German politicians—conservatives and social democrats alike—believed in a “ militant democracy , ” one where free speech could be constrained to protect democratic norms . Essentially , democrats had to use undemocratic means to protect democracy . Article 18 of the constitution states that anyone abusing rights like freedom of speech to undermine a free democratic order might forfeit those basic rights .
In that same post , I agreed that , in the specific circumstances of Germany just after the fall of the Third Reich , that might ( just ) be understandable , but now ?
Then there ’ s this from Flemming Rose of Jyllands-Posten , the Danish newspaper that published the Mohammed cartoons , in an interview with The New Yorker in 2015 ( my emphasis added ) :
I found that , contrary to what most people think , Weimar Germany did have hate-speech laws , and they were applied quite frequently . The assertion that Nazi propaganda played a significant role in mobilizing anti-Jewish sentiment is , of course , irrefutable . But to claim that the Holocaust could have been prevented if only anti-Semitic speech and Nazi propaganda had been banned has little basis in reality . Leading Nazis such as Joseph Goebbels , Theodor Fritsch , and Julius Streicher were all prosecuted for anti-Semitic speech . Streicher served two prison sentences . Rather than deterring the Nazis and countering anti-Semitism , the many court cases served as effective public-relations machinery , affording Streicher the kind of attention he would never have found in a climate of a free and open debate . In the years from 1923 to 1933 , Der Stürmer [ Streicher ’ s newspaper ] was either confiscated or editors taken to court on no fewer than thirty-six occasions . The more charges Streicher faced , the greater became the admiration of his supporters . The courts became an important platform for Streicher ’ s campaign against the Jews .
The precedent is far from strictly comparable , but there could still be a lesson there .","There is little over the Atlantic that bears much of a resemblance to the First Amendment, an absence (envied, sadly, by quite a few over here) that has often been exploited by a European political establishment that shows every sign of willingness to exploit the often deliberately exaggerated fear of ‘fake news’, a phenomenon—such as it is—far more healthily tackled by argument than by a gag, as a new excuse for shutting down speech of which it disapproves.

Here’s France’s President Macron, a defender, we are often told, of Europe’s liberal order.

The Guardian:

In his new year’s speech to journalists at the Élysée palace, Macron said he would shortly present the new law in order to fight the spread of fake news, which he said threatened liberal democracies…. For fake news published during election seasons, an emergency legal action could allow authorities to remove that content or even block the website, Macron said. “If we want to protect liberal democracies, we must be strong and have clear rules,” he added.

Quite who decides what is—or is not—fake news is an interesting question: Quis custodiet ipsos custodes and all that.

What makes it even more ‘interesting’ is the notion that news defined as fake should be suppressed with particular speed during an election campaign that may be over before the decision of the relevant authorities—whoever they may be—can be subjected to proper review. That could be…convenient.

Reuters:

“Only authoritarian regimes try to control what the truth is,” said senior conservative senator Bruno Retailleau. Freedom of expression carries risks, but that’s better “than the temptation to control minds,” he said.

The same Reuters report also notes that the EU Commission is looking at how to deal with fake news. Writing in Euractiv, Aline Robert and Catherine Stupp argue that Macron’s speech might encourage the Brussels bureaucracy to propose tougher measures than might otherwise have been the case.

Censors stick together.

Meanwhile, Reuters (my emphasis added):

A German satirical magazine’s Twitter account was blocked after it parodied anti-Muslim comments, the publication said on Wednesday, in what the national journalists association said showed the downside of a new law against online hate speech. Titanic magazine was mocking Beatrix von Storch, a member of the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, who accused police of trying “to appease the barbaric, Muslim, rapist hordes of men” by putting out a tweet in Arabic. Twitter briefly suspended her account and prosecutors are examining if her comments amount to incitement to hatred. Titanic magazine published its send-up late on Tuesday, in a tweet purporting to be from von Storch to the police, saying: “The last thing that I want is mollified barbarian, Muslim, gang-raping hordes of men.” Titanic said on Wednesday its Twitter account had been blocked over the message, which it assumed was a result of a law that came into full force on Jan. 1 that can impose fines of up to 50 million euros ($60 million) on social media sites that fail to remove hate speech [and fake news] promptly. “We are shocked,” Titanic editor Tim Wolff said on the magazine’s website, adding that Chancellor Angela Merkel and Justice Minister Heiko Maas had promised that the new law would not have this kind of effect.

If Wolff was truly shocked, he is truly naïve. Merkel, another (supposed) champion of ‘liberal’ values, has been Germany’s Chancellor since 2005. That’s long enough for anyone paying any attention to realize that she is reflexively authoritarian and, when it suits her, less than honest.

As for von Storch’s comments about the tweet, DW gives some context here:

The Cologne police tweeted New Year’s greetings and linked to information on celebrating safely in a series of messages in German and other languages, including Arabic. Cologne was the scene two years ago of mass sexual assaults on New Year’s Eve in which most of the suspects were described as young men of North African and Arab origin. “What the hell is happening in this country? Why is an official police site tweeting in Arabic? Do you think it is to appease the barbaric, gang-raping hordes of Muslim men?” wrote Beatrix von Storch, the deputy leader of the AfD’s parliamentary group. The tweet was later deleted after Twitter froze von Storch’s account and informed her she had violated hate speech rules. Her account was shut down for 12 hours. The Cologne police said on Monday that they had filed a criminal complaint against von Storch for hate speech.

Whatever one might think about von Storch’s comments, which read to me (and I’m not exactly a fan of Merkel’s immigration policies) as a harsh and intemperate response to a well-intentioned gesture by the police, she is the deputy leader of the AfD’s parliamentary group. And the AfD is no longer just a party of the fringe. Given an enormous boost both by Merkel’s Willkommenspolitik and the attempts by the media and political establishments to stifle criticism of the approach that the Chancellor had taken, the AfD secured nearly 13 percent of the vote in Germany’s recent elections. There is thus something particularly unsettling about von Storch’s (brief) silencing on Twitter, and something infinitely more sinister (and, probably counter-productive – more on that later) about the filing of a police complaint.

So far as Twitter is concerned, it’s understandable enough why the company did what it did. To be sure, Twitter is less even-handed in its approach to free speech than it pretends, but it’s hard to imagine that its decision will not have been influenced by the prospect of a massive fine should it have contravened Germany’s new censorship laws, laws so broadly drawn that even the UN was concerned.

Newsweek:

“Many of the violations covered by the bill are highly dependent on context, context which platforms are in no position to assess,” the U.N. Special Rapporteur to the High Commissioner for Human Rights David Kaye wrote of the law in the run up to its passage.

Reuters:

The Association of German Journalists (DJV) said the Twitter move [against Titanic] amounted to censorship, adding it had warned of this danger when the law was drawn up last year. “A private company based in the United States decides the boundaries of freedom of the press and opinion in Germany,” DJV Chairman Frank Ueberall said in a statement, calling on parliament to reverse the hate speech law. Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms are scrambling to adapt to the law, and its implementation is being closely watched after warnings that the threat of fines could prompt websites to block more content than necessary. Germany has some of the world’s toughest laws on defamation, incitement to commit crimes and threats of violence, with prison sentences for Holocaust denial or inciting hatred against minorities. Merkel’s conservatives accused the AfD of undermining the post-war democratic consensus in Germany. “The racism that AfD lawmakers have been tweeting for days is intentionally violating, with criminal intent, the basic consensus which democrats have built up since 1949 despite all disagreements,” Armin Laschet, party deputy of Merkel’s Christian Democrats, tweeted. “By doing this, they want to pave the way to a totally different republic.”

No-one should need reminding of Germany’s terrible history (to which, it may be unfair to note, von Storch has an unsettling family connection) and the circumstances that gave birth to the postwar republic’s attitude to free speech.

In an earlier post, I quoted Foreign Affairs:

Created in 1949, the West German federal constitution, also known as the Basic Law or Grundgesetz, contained a central paradox. Many West German politicians—conservatives and social democrats alike—believed in a “militant democracy,” one where free speech could be constrained to protect democratic norms. Essentially, democrats had to use undemocratic means to protect democracy. Article 18 of the constitution states that anyone abusing rights like freedom of speech to undermine a free democratic order might forfeit those basic rights.

In that same post, I agreed that, in the specific circumstances of Germany just after the fall of the Third Reich, that might (just) be understandable, but now?

Then there’s this from Flemming Rose of Jyllands-Posten, the Danish newspaper that published the Mohammed cartoons, in an interview with The New Yorker in 2015 (my emphasis added):

I found that, contrary to what most people think, Weimar Germany did have hate-speech laws, and they were applied quite frequently. The assertion that Nazi propaganda played a significant role in mobilizing anti-Jewish sentiment is, of course, irrefutable. But to claim that the Holocaust could have been prevented if only anti-Semitic speech and Nazi propaganda had been banned has little basis in reality.

Rather than deterring the Nazis and countering anti-Semitism, the many court cases served as effective public-relations machinery, affording Streicher the kind of attention he would never have found in a climate of a free and open debate. In the years from 1923 to 1933, Der Stürmer [Streicher’s newspaper] was either confiscated or editors taken to court on no fewer than thirty-six occasions. The more charges Streicher faced, the greater became the admiration of his supporters. The courts became an important platform for Streicher’s campaign against the Jews.

And indeed , as if on cue , two gunmen with apparent ties to Islamic militants overseas tried to storm the heavily secured event in a similar fashion , before being shot dead by a local police officer Sunday night .

“ Her words are not just free speech , ” says Linda Sarsour , executive director of the Arab American Association of New York . “ They are inciteful ; they incite hate against our whole community .

In one of the cartoons, the prophet is depicted as contorted and snarling and as a hook-nosed man in a turban holding a bloody knife. The caption reads, “When it comes to religion ...

President Trump ’ s schoolboy forensics is here particularly embarrassing . From Abraham Lincoln to Donald Trump : Evolution runs backward for American political parties .
We should not , in any case , accept the fiction that what is transpiring at the moment is a moral crusade rather than political opportunism .
Monuments have a way of being repurposed : Rome is an overwhelmingly Christian city , and its most famous monument is the Colosseum , where Christians were put to death for sport and for political gain . ( It was , however , more common for martyrs to meet their fate at the Circus Maximus . ) A famous Roman obelisk , originally brought from Egypt by Caligula as a symbol of imperial power , today stands in St. Peter ’ s Square , crowned by a small reliquary believed to contain fragments of the True Cross . The Roman Catholics might have proceeded in the same way as the Taliban with Buddhist monuments , smashing every relic of their pagan forebears . The Christian world has undergone such paroxysms from time to time : Iconoclasm is puritanism in vandalism .
The alternative mode is that associated with the ongoing — 492 years and counting — fight over the Babri mosque in India , which was , according to Hindu tradition , built on the site of a temple to Rama . In 1992 , Hindu activists sacked the mosque , setting off riots that claimed the lives of at least 2,000 people . In April of this year , India ’ s supreme court reinstated criminal conspiracy charges against a number of politicians involved in the episode , including L. K. Advani , a major national figure who cofounded the current ruling party . They ’ ll fight another 500 years over it . And Babur ’ s empire was a slave empire , too .
The older and wiser cultures learn to absorb , to repurpose , and to allow the patina of age to cover up the lingering pangs of historical wrongs . Which is good : You can not walk 25 feet in Rome without seeing a monument associated with some ancient horror or a statue of some god-awful emperor , but it would be a shame if they ’ d all been knocked down for political or moralistic purposes . And not all of these are important works of art : Some of them are simply old .
But conservatives have a soft spot for old things . We might look at those monuments the way Chesterton looked at a fence , trying to understand why they were put up in the first place before we decide to knock them down . They were not always put up for good reasons , but the conquering North indulged Southern jealousy of Southern honor for a pretty good reason : the desire for peace . The Civil War had been brutal , and the South was — this part of the story is not as widely understood as it should be — desperately poor , and remained essentially a Third World country within the United States until the post-war era . No sense poking them for no good reason .
The older and wiser cultures learn to absorb , to repurpose , and to allow the patina of age to cover up the lingering pangs of historical wrongs .
Anti-Southern sentiment among Democrats has grown , predictably , with the migration of Southern voters to the Republican party , a very long process that began in the early days of the New Deal and was confirmed only toward the end of the 20th century . ( Mississippi had one Republican governor in all the 20th century . ) As the country moved politically in a more conservative direction , and as the locus of conservative power moved south , anti-Southern invective became more common among progressives who a generation or two before had been all too happy to do business with a William Fulbright or a Woodrow Wilson . National panics over Confederate revanchism , like New York Times crusades against homelessness , tend to coincide with Republican presidencies . That is not coincidence .
The war on statuary serves two purposes : The first is to humiliate Southerners in retribution for their support of Republican politicians and conservative causes , particularly religious and social causes . The second is to help Democrats win elections without white men . If only whites voted , the last Democratic president would have been Lyndon Johnson . If only white men voted , Mitt Romney would have won 45 states and 501 electoral votes in 2012 . Donald Trump ’ s victory in 2016 showed Democrats that political math behind the Obama coalition — assembling enough groups of aggrieved minorities to create a majority — is no guarantee of victory in the Electoral College , especially when the charismatic young black man is replaced by a degenerate little old lady from Park Ridge . Keeping non-whites in a state of panic and agitation is necessary to Democrats ’ political aspirations . Twenty years of economic prosperity and social peace would do grievous damage to the Left : The Reagan boom , which lasted from the early 1980s until nearly the turn of the century , reduced the Left to little more than a few deans of students and had Bill Clinton complaining that he ’ s been forced to become an Eisenhower Republican to win and keep the presidency .
The war on statuary serves two purposes : The first is to humiliate Southerners in retribution for their support of Republican politicians and conservative causes
The Democrats ’ motives here are tawdry and self-serving , for the most part . As cheap and silly as Southern sentimentality can be , the desire to reduce and humiliate one ’ s fellow citizens is distasteful . We would all do better to take Abraham Lincoln ’ s advice : “ We are not enemies , but friends . We must not be enemies. ” Friends overlook one another ’ s little vices .
And friends do not terrorize one another by torchlight . Republicans would do well to remember what the alternative to being the party of Lincoln really is .
What ought conservatives to do ? They should listen to the oldest and most widely applicable of all the councils of conservatism and do — exactly — nothing . The ancient conservative bias in favor of inertia here points toward the wiser course . There is no need to join in with the vandals and the iconoclasts , even if we sympathize with some of their good-faith reservations about Confederate memorials . But to the extent that the iconoclasm here mainly consists of local authorities making democratic decisions about the disposition of public property , there is a case for political quietism in this matter . This isn ’ t Yalta . The Left ’ s vandalism is intended mainly to get a rise out of the Right , in the hopes of getting some Republican to wrong-foot himself over a racial question . Trump ’ s easy pickin ’ s for that , but there isn ’ t any reason actual Republicans have to go along with him . In the words of the conservative philosopher Paul McCartney : Let it be .
Republicans were on the winning side of the Civil War the first time around . There is no need to join the losing side after the fact .","Workers prepare to remove a statue of Robert E. Lee in New Orleans. (Reuters photo: Jonathan Bachman)

There were honorable men fighting on the Southern side, to be sure, and their fight was an honorable one to the extent that risking life and limb on behalf of one’s home and people is generally honorable. General Lee is widely considered to have been an honorable military man, and so was Field Marshal Rommel. But General Lee’s cause was destroying the United States of America to facilitate slavery. The historical record, including practically every Confederate document explaining Southern separation, makes that clear enough. That the abolitionists were imperfect in their commitment to the liberation of the slaves and that there were Southern men of conscience who detested slavery and yet fought on behalf of its preserver does not change any of that.

Rather than embrace their party’s proudest and finest legacy, Republicans are now trying to explain away President Trump’s insistence that there were some very fine gentlemen among the tiki-Nazis in Charlottesville. President Trump’s schoolboy forensics is here particularly embarrassing. From Abraham Lincoln to Donald Trump: Evolution runs backward for American political parties.

We should not, in any case, accept the fiction that what is transpiring at the moment is a moral crusade rather than political opportunism.

Monuments have a way of being repurposed: Rome is an overwhelmingly Christian city, and its most famous monument is the Colosseum, where Christians were put to death for sport and for political gain. (It was, however, more common for martyrs to meet their fate at the Circus Maximus.) A famous Roman obelisk, originally brought from Egypt by Caligula as a symbol of imperial power, today stands in St. Peter’s Square, crowned by a small reliquary believed to contain fragments of the True Cross. The Roman Catholics might have proceeded in the same way as the Taliban with Buddhist monuments, smashing every relic of their pagan forebears. The Christian world has undergone such paroxysms from time to time: Iconoclasm is puritanism in vandalism.

The alternative mode is that associated with the ongoing — 492 years and counting — fight over the Babri mosque in India, which was, according to Hindu tradition, built on the site of a temple to Rama. In 1992, Hindu activists sacked the mosque, setting off riots that claimed the lives of at least 2,000 people. In April of this year, India’s supreme court reinstated criminal conspiracy charges against a number of politicians involved in the episode, including L. K. Advani, a major national figure who cofounded the current ruling party. They’ll fight another 500 years over it. And Babur’s empire was a slave empire, too.

The older and wiser cultures learn to absorb, to repurpose, and to allow the patina of age to cover up the lingering pangs of historical wrongs. Which is good: You cannot walk 25 feet in Rome without seeing a monument associated with some ancient horror or a statue of some god-awful emperor, but it would be a shame if they’d all been knocked down for political or moralistic purposes. And not all of these are important works of art: Some of them are simply old.

But conservatives have a soft spot for old things. We might look at those monuments the way Chesterton looked at a fence, trying to understand why they were put up in the first place before we decide to knock them down. They were not always put up for good reasons, but the conquering North indulged Southern jealousy of Southern honor for a pretty good reason: the desire for peace. The Civil War had been brutal, and the South was — this part of the story is not as widely understood as it should be — desperately poor, and remained essentially a Third World country within the United States until the post-war era. No sense poking them for no good reason.

The older and wiser cultures learn to absorb, to repurpose, and to allow the patina of age to cover up the lingering pangs of historical wrongs.

Anti-Southern sentiment among Democrats has grown, predictably, with the migration of Southern voters to the Republican party, a very long process that began in the early days of the New Deal and was confirmed only toward the end of the 20th century. (Mississippi had one Republican governor in all the 20th century.) As the country moved politically in a more conservative direction, and as the locus of conservative power moved south, anti-Southern invective became more common among progressives who a generation or two before had been all too happy to do business with a William Fulbright or a Woodrow Wilson. National panics over Confederate revanchism, like New York Times crusades against homelessness, tend to coincide with Republican presidencies. That is not coincidence.

The war on statuary serves two purposes: The first is to humiliate Southerners in retribution for their support of Republican politicians and conservative causes, particularly religious and social causes. The second is to help Democrats win elections without white men. If only whites voted, the last Democratic president would have been Lyndon Johnson. If only white men voted, Mitt Romney would have won 45 states and 501 electoral votes in 2012. Donald Trump’s victory in 2016 showed Democrats that political math behind the Obama coalition — assembling enough groups of aggrieved minorities to create a majority — is no guarantee of victory in the Electoral College, especially when the charismatic young black man is replaced by a degenerate little old lady from Park Ridge. Keeping non-whites in a state of panic and agitation is necessary to Democrats’ political aspirations. Twenty years of economic prosperity and social peace would do grievous damage to the Left: The Reagan boom, which lasted from the early 1980s until nearly the turn of the century, reduced the Left to little more than a few deans of students and had Bill Clinton complaining that he’s been forced to become an Eisenhower Republican to win and keep the presidency.

The Democrats’ motives here are tawdry and self-serving, for the most part. As cheap and silly as Southern sentimentality can be, the desire to reduce and humiliate one’s fellow citizens is distasteful. We would all do better to take Abraham Lincoln’s advice: “We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies.” Friends overlook one another’s little vices.

And friends do not terrorize one another by torchlight. Republicans would do well to remember what the alternative to being the party of Lincoln really is.

What ought conservatives to do? They should listen to the oldest and most widely applicable of all the councils of conservatism and do — exactly — nothing. The ancient conservative bias in favor of inertia here points toward the wiser course. There is no need to join in with the vandals and the iconoclasts, even if we sympathize with some of their good-faith reservations about Confederate memorials. But to the extent that the iconoclasm here mainly consists of local authorities making democratic decisions about the disposition of public property, there is a case for political quietism in this matter. This isn’t Yalta. The Left’s vandalism is intended mainly to get a rise out of the Right, in the hopes of getting some Republican to wrong-foot himself over a racial question. Trump’s easy pickin’s for that, but there isn’t any reason actual Republicans have to go along with him. In the words of the conservative philosopher Paul McCartney: Let it be.

Republicans were on the winning side of the Civil War the first time around. There is no need to join the losing side after the fact.

Schwartz Distinguished Professor of Law at UCLA, and the co-founder of the Volokh Conspiracy, which is hosted at Reason.com.

The first episode looks at the seven things you should know about how the First Amendment is applied in schools:

Script:

Here are the Seven Rules of Free Speech in Schools

1. Political and religious speech is protected (Mostly)

Students, from first grade to twelfth, can't be punished based on their political or religious speech. As the Supreme Court said in the Tinker case, ""It can hardly be argued that … students … shed their constitutional rights… at the schoolhouse gate.""

This protects, for instance,

Wearing black armbands to protest a war

Distributing religious messages to classmates between classes.

Or criticizing a teacher over lunch.

2. Disruptive speech is not protected

But schools can punish speech that ""materially disrupts schoolwork,"" for instance because it prompts fights.

That's why some lower courts have let schools ban clothing that displays Confederate flags, and in one case even clothing that displays an American flag on Cinco de Mayo, when that display led to violence.

That's a kind of ""heckler's veto,"" where threats against a speaker are used by the government to justify restricting the speaker rather than the threateners. Usually the government can't impose such a heckler's veto—but the rule in schools seems to be different.

That may not seem right to you, but I don't make the law—I just make videos about it.

3. Vulgar or sexual speech is not protected

Schools can also punish students for using vulgarities or sexual innuendos. So if you do criticize that teacher over lunch, be… you know… polite about it.

4. Praising drugs is not protected

Schools can punish speech that seems to praise drug use, and probably also alcohol use and other crimes, at least when the speech doesn't seem political. That's from Morse v. Frederick, where the Supreme Court said a school could suspend a student for holding up a banner that read ""BONG HiTS 4 JESUS."" Yes, this is a real case. In fact, you actually can find audio of Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer saying (audio: ""Bong Hits for Jesus, heh, heh, heh""). Which is completely surreal.

So ""legalize marijuana"" is probably okay; while ""marijuana is awesome"" probably isn't.

5. Official school newspapers are the school's own speech

You may have the right to speak at school, but you don't have the right so speak in the school newspaper. Courts see the newspaper as the school's own speech, even if students are the ones who write it. The principal has ultimate control over what goes in the newspaper, and can delete or edit any article for pretty much any reason.

6. This Only Applies to Public Schools

Everything said so far deals with public schools. Under the so-called ""state action doctrine"" the First Amendment doesn't limit private schools, even ones that get tax breaks or government funds.

The first words of the First Amendment are ""Congress shall make no law …""—that applies to the federal government. The Fourteenth Amendment basically says no ""state"" shall violate people's rights—that applies the First Amendment to state and local governments. But the Constitution generally doesn't constrain private property owners, private landlords, private schools, or anyone else.

That's why, when your parents told you to stop saying rude things at the dinner table, and you asked, ""What about my First Amendment rights?,"" they said, ""Let's talk about the state action doctrine.""

Or at least, that's what they should have said.

7. California is different

And…it's all different in California. Sure, everything is different in California, but what I mean is that everything I've said so far is the constitutional minimum that all states must provide. Some states have passed laws that provide more protection to students. In California, for instance,

High school students generally can't be punished for their speech even if it provokes other students into acting disruptively.

They generally can't be punished for speech about drugs or alcohol, or even vulgar speech

And public school newspapers are mostly free from being censored by the administration. Student newspapers are protected in some other states, too

Indeed, in California, all the student speech protections—but not the student newspaper speech protections—apply to private high school students as well (but not in religious high schools.)

So there you have it:

Political and religious speech is protected, but not Disruptive speech, Vulgar speech, sexual speech, or speech praising drugs.

Also, official school newspapers are the school's own speech, this stuff really only applies to Public Schools, and of course, California is different

That's the law of free speech in school, cobbled together by the Court and a few legislatures over the last 50 years or so.

free_speech,Politico,0,https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/17/zuckerberg-georgetown-speech-050110,The meaning behind Mark Zuckerberg’s aggressive plea for ‘free expression’,2019-10-17,,"This is ███ ’ s breakdown of the highlights from Zuckerberg ’ s speech , what they mean and how they may play in Washington ’ s tech debate :
“ We did n't have the broad free speech protections that we have now until the 1960s , when the Supreme Court ruled in opinions like New York Times vs. Sullivan that they can criticize public figures as long as they 're not doing so with actual malice , even if what you 're saying is false . ”
Here , he is citing a landmark 1964 Supreme Court decision that freed the news media to aggressively cover public officials without the threat of libel suits for inadvertent mistakes . By nodding to a court case that 's a staple of journalism schools , Zuckerberg is aiming for some common ground with the news media , even as that industry lobbies Congress to help news companies compete with Facebook and Google for digital ad money .
Zuckerberg also points out an often-overlooked aspect of the SCOTUS case : It involved an ad , much like the ones Facebook sells .
“ Now , some people believe that giving more people a voice is driving division rather than bringing people together . More people across the spectrum believe that achieving the political outcomes that they think matter is more important than every person having a voice and being heard . And I think that that ’ s dangerous . ”
Zuckerberg alludes to recent criticisms from Democratic leaders , most notably presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren , who say the platform has done too little to crack down on misinformation from politicians such as President Donald Trump . Zuckerberg tries to flip the critics ' arguments on their head , saying it 's `` dangerous '' — not just politically expedient — for a candidate to urge a social media company to take down a foe 's message .
“ In times of social tension , our impulse is often to pull back from free expression because we want the progress that comes in from free expression but we do n't want this tension . We saw this when Martin Luther King Jr. wrote his famous letter from a Birmingham Jail when he was unconstitutionally jailed for protesting peacefully . And we saw this in the effort to shut down campus protests during the Vietnam war . We saw this way back when America was deeply polarized about its role in World War I and the Supreme Court ruled at the time that the socialist leader Eugene Debs could be imprisoned for making an anti-war speech . In the end all of these decisions were wrong . ”
Martin Luther King 's letter is a foundational text for civil rights activists and a revered part of American history . Citing it , as well as the experience of dissenters stretch back to Debs , is a way to remind the left that its own heritage has relied on free speech .
The short version of Zuckerberg 's message : `` People in power often roll back human rights when times get tough and scary . Do n't be those people . ''
But the CEO is on potentially treacherous ground if people think he 's trying to liken his hugely profitable corporation to a hero like King .
“ Take livestreaming for example . This allows families to be together for moments like birthdays . We 've even had a few weddings . It allows schoolteachers to read children bedtime stories they might not otherwise have read to . Of course it allows us to witness some really important cultural moments . But we ’ ve also seen people broadcast self harm and suicide , some terrible acts . ”
Zuckerberg 's company faced huge criticism after a gunman used Facebook Live to stream the video of two mosque massacres that killed 51 people last March in Christchurch , New Zealand — including demands that Facebook just yank the service . Zuckerberg 's effort to paint a picture of people celebrating their birthdays via Facebook Live — how often does that really happen ? — suggests that he has n't really figured out his argument for not shutting it down .
“ I believe that we have two responsibilities : to remove content when it can cause real danger as effectively as we can and to fight to uphold as wide of a definition of freedom of expression as possible and to not allow the definition of what is considered dangerous to expand beyond what is absolutely necessary . ”
The funny thing here is that Congress , too , thought online platforms had those same two responsibilities when it passed Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act , a law that protects online companies from lawsuits over content from their users .
The thinking back then : If all these new websites did a decent job handling the worst of what people post , they could otherwise be largely left alone . Silicon Valley regularly cites that law as the only reason the internet has flourished as it has .
But in recent years many Democrats and at least some Republicans have argued that Facebook — plus Google , Twitter and others — have failed to maintain a basic level of decency on their platforms , letting everything from ads for sexual slavery to terrorist recruitment materials run rampant . And because of it , Congress has started rolling back Section 230 .
“ We do n't fact check political ads and we do n't do this to help politicians , but because we think people should be able to see for themselves what politicians are saying . For the same reason , if content is newsworthy , we also wo n't take it down . ”
Zuckerberg has argued again and again that Facebook does n't want the company 's moderators serving as `` arbiters of truth . '' For one thing , that would require the company to hire on or contract a whole lot of moderators .
But here , Zuckerberg 's trying to align himself with those who find his own power over the speech of 2 billion people to be unsettling . Of course , he gave himself much of that power by structuring Facebook , from its founding , as almost totally under his control .
“ We do n't fact check political ads and we do n't do this to help politicians , but because we think people should be able to see for themselves what politicians are saying . For the same reason , if content is newsworthy , we also wo n't take it down . ”
Part of what Zuckerberg was trying to pull off with this speech was cleaning up for Nick Clegg , the company 's head of global public policy ( and a former deputy prime minister in the United Kingdom ) . In remarks a few weeks ago in D.C. , Clegg laid out the company 's policy of not pulling down politicians ' misleading content . The result was n't what Facebook intended — Clegg 's remarks caused much confusion and anger from its critics , including Democratic frontrunners Warren and Joe Biden .
But Zuckerberg 's message was n't much different from Clegg 's . Facebook is betting on the broader arc of Zuckerberg 's speech to help the rest of us make sense of the policy . But a punchier talking point here would probably have helped , too .
“ I know many people disagree with this , but in general , I don ’ t think it ’ s right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy . And we are not an outlier here . The other major internet platforms and the vast majority of media also run the same ads . ”
Facebook has faced the brunt of criticism from Democrats for running a misleading Trump campaign ad attacking Biden . Here , Zuckerberg points out that competitors like Google-owned YouTube and Twitter , plus mainstream news outlets like Fox News and MSNBC , also signed off on the advertisement .
“ Given the sensitivity around political ads , I ’ ve considered whether we should stop allowing them altogether . From a business perspective , the controversy certainly is not worth the very small part of our business that they make up . But political ads can be an important part of voice , especially for local candidates and up-and-coming challengers and advocacy groups the media might not otherwise cover so that way they can get their voice into the debate . Banning political ads favors incumbents and whoever the media chooses to cover . But practically , even if we wanted to ban political ads , it ’ s not even clear where you draw the line . ”
Zuckerberg addresses the elephant in the room : Facebook profits from having more relaxed rules for political advertising . The company has already pocketed more than $ 50 million from 2020 candidates running ads on its platform , according to figures compiled by ███ . Even though that amount might just be a `` small part '' of Facebook 's business , as Zuckerberg notes , it still calls into question the notion that it 's willingness to greenlight nearly all political ads is rooted purely in high-minded ideals . And his all-or-nothing framing sets up a bit of a false dichotomy ; not everyone objecting to Facebook letting candidates including Trump lie in ads wants a total ban on political advertising .
“ I wanted our services in China because I believe in connecting the whole world . And I thought maybe we could help create a more open society . This is something I worked hard on for a long time . But we could never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there . And they never let us in . And now we have more freedom to speak out and stand up for the values that we believe in and fight for free expression around the world . ”
These comments highlight the tech industry 's challenging relationship with China , a hugely lucrative market where competitors like Google have struggled with how to navigate Beijing 's strict controls on free speech . Not to mention the endless political headaches in Washington .
Zuckerberg 's criticism of China may also play well in the Trump White House , which has been waging a trade war in an attempt to counter Chinese influence around the world . And it may resonate with people alarmed at the way other organizations , most recently the NBA , have tiptoed around China 's speech crackdowns .","The big question: Will it work?

This is POLITICO’s breakdown of the highlights from Zuckerberg’s speech, what they mean and how they may play in Washington’s tech debate:

JOURNALISTS NEED FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION TOO

“We didn't have the broad free speech protections that we have now until the 1960s, when the Supreme Court ruled in opinions like New York Times vs. Sullivan that they can criticize public figures as long as they're not doing so with actual malice, even if what you're saying is false.”



Here, he is citing a landmark 1964 Supreme Court decision that freed the news media to aggressively cover public officials without the threat of libel suits for inadvertent mistakes. By nodding to a court case that's a staple of journalism schools, Zuckerberg is aiming for some common ground with the news media, even as that industry lobbies Congress to help news companies compete with Facebook and Google for digital ad money.

Zuckerberg also points out an often-overlooked aspect of the SCOTUS case: It involved an ad, much like the ones Facebook sells.

NO, YOU'RE DANGEROUS

“Now, some people believe that giving more people a voice is driving division rather than bringing people together. More people across the spectrum believe that achieving the political outcomes that they think matter is more important than every person having a voice and being heard. And I think that that’s dangerous.”



Zuckerberg alludes to recent criticisms from Democratic leaders, most notably presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, who say the platform has done too little to crack down on misinformation from politicians such as President Donald Trump. Zuckerberg tries to flip the critics' arguments on their head, saying it's ""dangerous"" — not just politically expedient — for a candidate to urge a social media company to take down a foe's message.

LEARN THE LESSONS OF HISTORY

“In times of social tension, our impulse is often to pull back from free expression because we want the progress that comes in from free expression but we don't want this tension. We saw this when Martin Luther King Jr. wrote his famous letter from a Birmingham Jail when he was unconstitutionally jailed for protesting peacefully. And we saw this in the effort to shut down campus protests during the Vietnam war. We saw this way back when America was deeply polarized about its role in World War I and the Supreme Court ruled at the time that the socialist leader Eugene Debs could be imprisoned for making an anti-war speech. In the end all of these decisions were wrong.”



Martin Luther King's letter is a foundational text for civil rights activists and a revered part of American history. Citing it, as well as the experience of dissenters stretch back to Debs, is a way to remind the left that its own heritage has relied on free speech.

The short version of Zuckerberg's message: ""People in power often roll back human rights when times get tough and scary. Don't be those people.""

But the CEO is on potentially treacherous ground if people think he's trying to liken his hugely profitable corporation to a hero like King.

LIVESTREAMING ISN'T JUST ABOUT ATROCITIES

“Take livestreaming for example. This allows families to be together for moments like birthdays. We've even had a few weddings. It allows schoolteachers to read children bedtime stories they might not otherwise have read to. Of course it allows us to witness some really important cultural moments. But we’ve also seen people broadcast self harm and suicide, some terrible acts.”



Zuckerberg's company faced huge criticism after a gunman used Facebook Live to stream the video of two mosque massacres that killed 51 people last March in Christchurch, New Zealand — including demands that Facebook just yank the service. Zuckerberg's effort to paint a picture of people celebrating their birthdays via Facebook Live — how often does that really happen? — suggests that he hasn't really figured out his argument for not shutting it down.

A MESSAGE TAILORED FOR LAWMAKERS

“I believe that we have two responsibilities: to remove content when it can cause real danger as effectively as we can and to fight to uphold as wide of a definition of freedom of expression as possible and to not allow the definition of what is considered dangerous to expand beyond what is absolutely necessary.”



The funny thing here is that Congress, too, thought online platforms had those same two responsibilities when it passed Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, a law that protects online companies from lawsuits over content from their users.

The thinking back then: If all these new websites did a decent job handling the worst of what people post, they could otherwise be largely left alone. Silicon Valley regularly cites that law as the only reason the internet has flourished as it has.

But in recent years many Democrats and at least some Republicans have argued that Facebook — plus Google, Twitter and others — have failed to maintain a basic level of decency on their platforms, letting everything from ads for sexual slavery to terrorist recruitment materials run rampant. And because of it, Congress has started rolling back Section 230.

WE'RE NOT THE 'TRUTH' POLICE

“We don't fact check political ads and we don't do this to help politicians, but because we think people should be able to see for themselves what politicians are saying. For the same reason, if content is newsworthy, we also won't take it down.”



Zuckerberg has argued again and again that Facebook doesn't want the company's moderators serving as ""arbiters of truth."" For one thing, that would require the company to hire on or contract a whole lot of moderators.

But here, Zuckerberg's trying to align himself with those who find his own power over the speech of 2 billion people to be unsettling. Of course, he gave himself much of that power by structuring Facebook, from its founding, as almost totally under his control.

LET'S TRY THIS ARGUMENT AGAIN

“We don't fact check political ads and we don't do this to help politicians, but because we think people should be able to see for themselves what politicians are saying. For the same reason, if content is newsworthy, we also won't take it down.”



Part of what Zuckerberg was trying to pull off with this speech was cleaning up for Nick Clegg, the company's head of global public policy (and a former deputy prime minister in the United Kingdom). In remarks a few weeks ago in D.C., Clegg laid out the company's policy of not pulling down politicians' misleading content. The result wasn't what Facebook intended — Clegg's remarks caused much confusion and anger from its critics, including Democratic frontrunners Warren and Joe Biden.

But Zuckerberg's message wasn't much different from Clegg's. Facebook is betting on the broader arc of Zuckerberg's speech to help the rest of us make sense of the policy. But a punchier talking point here would probably have helped, too.

OTHER COMPANIES RAN TRUMP'S AD TOO

“I know many people disagree with this, but in general, I don’t think it’s right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy. And we are not an outlier here. The other major internet platforms and the vast majority of media also run the same ads.”



Facebook has faced the brunt of criticism from Democrats for running a misleading Trump campaign ad attacking Biden. Here, Zuckerberg points out that competitors like Google-owned YouTube and Twitter, plus mainstream news outlets like Fox News and MSNBC, also signed off on the advertisement.

HITTING THE BOTTOM LINE

“Given the sensitivity around political ads, I’ve considered whether we should stop allowing them altogether. From a business perspective, the controversy certainly is not worth the very small part of our business that they make up. But political ads can be an important part of voice, especially for local candidates and up-and-coming challengers and advocacy groups the media might not otherwise cover so that way they can get their voice into the debate. Banning political ads favors incumbents and whoever the media chooses to cover. But practically, even if we wanted to ban political ads, it’s not even clear where you draw the line.”



Zuckerberg addresses the elephant in the room: Facebook profits from having more relaxed rules for political advertising. The company has already pocketed more than $50 million from 2020 candidates running ads on its platform, according to figures compiled by POLITICO. Even though that amount might just be a ""small part"" of Facebook's business, as Zuckerberg notes, it still calls into question the notion that it's willingness to greenlight nearly all political ads is rooted purely in high-minded ideals. And his all-or-nothing framing sets up a bit of a false dichotomy; not everyone objecting to Facebook letting candidates including Trump lie in ads wants a total ban on political advertising.

TECH AND CHINA: 'IT'S COMPLICATED'

“I wanted our services in China because I believe in connecting the whole world. And I thought maybe we could help create a more open society. This is something I worked hard on for a long time. But we could never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there. And they never let us in. And now we have more freedom to speak out and stand up for the values that we believe in and fight for free expression around the world.”



These comments highlight the tech industry's challenging relationship with China, a hugely lucrative market where competitors like Google have struggled with how to navigate Beijing's strict controls on free speech. Not to mention the endless political headaches in Washington.

Zuckerberg's criticism of China may also play well in the Trump White House, which has been waging a trade war in an attempt to counter Chinese influence around the world. And it may resonate with people alarmed at the way other organizations, most recently the NBA, have tiptoed around China's speech crackdowns.

Authorities in Britain now seem more interested in fighting hate speech on the internet than fighting crime and are warning social media users that their comments are being monitored.

Sweden 'Moving Toward Authoritarianism'

But Sweden is taking the most aggressive approach against free speech with a proposed new law that would make it a serious offense to publish material that would embarrass the Swedish government internationally. Another law would make it harder to show that immigrants are responsible for most violent crime.

Crime is now so bad in some parts of Sweden there has been talk of calling out the army to help the police.

But the new law would ban public use of government data that could be used to identify the ethnic origins of criminals.

""We are moving toward authoritarianism,"" warns Swedish blogger Johan Westerholm.

Phillips, David French, Jordan Sillars, Jay Nordlinger, Kevin D. Williamson, Victor Davis Hanson, Jonah Goldberg, Yuval Levin","A too-broad interpretation of the Constitution ’ s free-speech clause protects things that have nothing to do with speech and makes other clauses superfluous .
Earlier this year , the Defense Department limited the right of the transgendered to serve in the military . Three federal courts blocked the policy for infringing the constitutional rights of the transgender individuals . One of the judges relied on the same clause of the Constitution as the cake maker who refused to bake a wedding cake for a gay marriage . The Supreme Court has invoked that same clause to defend the right to burn the American flag , dance in the nude , and make unlimited campaign contributions .
The Supreme Court ’ s current law of free speech will perplex the ordinary American . After all , changing sex , making a cake , burning the flag , dancing nude , and contributing money have little in common , least of all speech .
The imperialistic expansion of free speech would not just surprise most 21st-century Americans ; it would also make little sense to the 18th-century Americans who ratified the First Amendment . They would find it astounding that the courts have not just read speech to include many forms of conduct , but also have failed to establish any objective test for what constitutes speech . The Supreme Court appears to apply the perpetually malleable standard that emerged when it has sought to identify obscenity : It knows it when it sees it .
When the Court agrees that something is speech , however , it gives it the highest of protections known to constitutional law . The Court allows government to restrict the time , place , and manner of speech , as long as the state does not discriminate based on its content or the speaker . But if government tries to regulate content or discriminate between speakers , it must demonstrate that the law is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest . Observers once thought that this “ strict scrutiny ” test was “ strict in theory , fatal in fact ” because no law could survive it .
The Court ’ s failure to apply a consistent test for conduct-as-speech is not really the problem . Rather , the problem is that its First Amendment standards are judicial inventions . The Court ’ s definition of speech is unmoored from the Constitution ’ s text and original understanding , which should set the only lodestar for the Roberts Court , now up to full conservative strength with the addition of Justice Brett Kavanaugh .
The First Amendment declares that “ Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or of the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. ” This text protects four distinct rights : speech , press , assembly , and petition . Yet the Court has allowed free-speech imperialism to expand so far as to swallow up these other First Amendment rights .
Take the assembly clause . There are few cases where the Supreme Court has protected a right to assembly . Instead , the Court has replaced it with a judicially invented “ freedom of association ” that it somehow discovered in the constitutional language of “ freedom of speech. ” This is not only wrong as a matter of interpretive principle , but John Inazu has persuasively shown that the right of assembly was both broader and more concrete than the Court ’ s creation of a free-speech right of “ association . ”
For example , the Court ’ s freedom of association limits constitutional protection through adjectives : “ expressive ” or “ intimate. ” But there are no qualifiers in front of the Constitution ’ s prohibition on “ abridging . . . the right of the people peaceably to assemble. ” All types of assembly are protected , as long as they are peaceable . In fact , the Congress that passed the First Amendment rejected an attempt to add the limiting language “ and consult for the common good ” to the freedom of assembly .
Likewise , as Inazu has pointed out , by treating the right of assembly as derivative of the right to speak freely , the analysis turns on the what of a message rather than the who or the where of assembly . This enables government discrimination among groups so long as it is “ reasonable ” and a group ’ s message is not targeted .
According to the original meaning unearthed by Inazu , the right to assembly is also broader than free speech because it protects a group ’ s right to use public space for gatherings . The original right further protected the right to plan an assembly via perpetual associations that controlled the selection of their own leaders . Christian student groups would no longer have to accept a leader , as required by many colleges and universities , who does not agree with their religious beliefs . Thus , as Michael McConnell has argued , much “ is lost when the courts reduce the freedom of groups to a freedom of speech and protect groups only from regulations that would impair their public messages . ”
The freedoms of press and petition are stand-alone rights just as much as the right to assembly . If the free-speech clause were as broad as the Court now reads it , these rights would have been redundant . But , as Chief Justice John Marshall reminded us in the foundational McCullough v. Maryland , every word of the Constitution must have a meaning . Just as the Court has incorrectly expanded federal power under the commerce clause so as to make Congress ’ s other constitutional powers redundant , so too has the free-speech clause grown past its original confines to render irrelevant other constitutional provisions . To give meaning to the press , petition , and assembly clauses , we must restore a narrower scope of the free-speech clause ’ s original meaning .
The Framers believed that the freedom to speak , write , and publish were natural rights . The government could not regulate speech unless it directly injured others . But , as Jud Campbell has recently shown , this allowed the state to regulate speech that misled or directly harmed others , such as “ libel , defamation , conspiracy , threats , profanity , blasphemy , perjury , sedition , and so forth . ”
Nor did the Framers believe the right to free speech included “ expressive conduct. ” Thus , for instance , some Founders criticized theater bans not because they infringed speech , but rather because they infringed the natural right to spend one ’ s time and money as one pleased . In the mid-1790s , some argued that the raising of liberty poles was protected speech , but such views were the minority position .
Some scholars , such as Yale law professor Akhil Amar , take the even narrower view that the free-speech clause stemmed from traditional protections for the official speech and debate of legislators . Article II , section 6 , clause 1 protects official speech in Congress : “ and for any Speech or Debate in either House , they shall not be questioned in any other Place. ” Thus , Amar argues , the First Amendment ’ s use of the word speech should also be understood as protecting only similar speech . Whatever James Madison and the other Framers ’ intentions , however , the constitutional text protects just “ speech , ” rather than “ political speech ” or “ legislative speech or debate . ”
Ironically , while the Court has diverged from the First Amendment ’ s original meaning by watering down the definition of speech , the Court has determined that commercial speech deserves lesser protection . But again , the Constitution makes no distinction between types of speech . Speech is speech under the First Amendment , whether political , religious , commercial , ideological , academic , or other . The only way that commercial speech could receive less protection under the Constitution is , under the natural-rights framework , because it is more prone to certain harm than other types of speech , and thus can trigger government regulation . But that ’ s a correlation , not a categorical distinction — and must be determined case by case .
Given this original meaning , some of the Court ’ s canonical , if not controversial , free-speech decisions have wandered far beyond the Constitution ’ s text and history . Certainly the Court ’ s 1972 decision finding a constitutional right to nude dancing is wrong ( California v. LaRue ) . Similarly , Texas v. Johnson , in which the Court concluded that flag burning is speech , is also probably wrong .
Restricting free speech to just that — speech — rather than conduct , cuts both ways . For example , liberals want sexual orientation to be speech . Conservatives want cake baking to be speech . Neither would have constituted speech at the time of the ratification of the Bill of Rights . The Constitution ’ s original meaning is not necessarily conservative or liberal .
Conservatives have arguably pushed an erroneous free-speech argument as to why limits on campaign contributions , such as those upheld in Buckley v. Valeo , violate the First Amendment . They sometimes reason that financial contributions facilitate candidate speech ; thus , limiting donations unconstitutionally limits speech . And in McCutcheon v. FEC , the Supreme Court struck down overall limits on how much an individual may donate to compaigns ( though it left in place limits on how much an individual may donate to a single candidate ) , arguing that donations constitute both “ political expression ” and “ political association . ”
We think the Founders might have disagreed that money equals speech . Money facilitates speech . So does a megaphone , or a personal computer . Nor does all money constitute speech ; we do not speak when we buy an apple at the supermarket . Not all money given to candidates even goes towards electoral speech .
It would be different if a law banned spending money on speech directly by individuals or entities . Imagine a law making it illegal to buy billboard space or take out an ad in a newspaper . Such a law prohibits spending money to speak in a forum that one has to first pay to use . This would violate the free-speech clause .
Still , that doesn ’ t mean conservative arguments are wrong regarding the constitutionality of campaign-contribution laws . These arguments just look at the wrong part of the Constitution .
The first question one should always ask in constitutional analysis is : Under which enumerated power did Congress act ? No doubt Congress claims its authority to regulate campaign contributions derived from its power to regulate “ The Times , Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives . ”
Notice , though , that Congress is not authorized to regulate campaigns , but the “ times , places , and manner of holding elections. ” As research on the framing suggests , regulating the manner of holding elections only included the actual running of the election , such as whether to have secret or voice voting , not the campaign leading up to the election . McCutcheon may have reached the right result but taken the wrong path by neglecting to demand constitutional authority for the federal campaign laws .
What is more , there may be a free-press problem with some campaign-finance statutes , such as the one struck down in Citizens United . That statute prevented corporations from paying for a political ad within 30 days of a campaign election . Today ’ s television , radio , and Internet ads are the equivalent of the pamphlets and handbills of 18th-century politics . It ’ s hard to believe that the founding generation would have understood the Constitution to tolerate a government ban on private ownership of printing presses , or the prevention of the use of money to buy them . Citizens United makes more sense under the original understanding of the First Amendment as a protection of the right to a free press than as a right to make unlimited campaign contributions .
The Court ’ s errant course will leave it at sea for the most important free-speech issues coming over the horizon . While past cases focused on whether cities could ban nude dancing or the government could stop flag burning , future cases will ask whether the First Amendment regulates the most important arenas for the communication of ideas today : universities and the Internet .
Traditional paradigms of free-speech cases involve the government pretextually using neutral laws to target unpopular views . But our future controversies will not fit that familiar form . Congressional hearings have already sought to determine whether Facebook , Google , and Twitter have suppressed speech by conservatives . Universities have attempted to prevent controversial conservatives from speaking on campus , punished conservative professors for their speech ( including in the classroom ) , or generally suppressed conservative student groups ’ attempt to communicate to the greater campus a message that does not stick to the views of the liberal orthodoxy . Corporate chieftains or university presidents will play the censors of the future .
Does this violate the free-speech clause ? Under its original meaning , often not . The clause applies only to government actors , so it wouldn ’ t apply to private companies or private universities , just public ones . On the other hand , both the Internet and universities are intertwined with the government . The federal government created the Internet and provides important support for its operation , such as protecting Internet firms from liability and excessive state regulation . Many universities , similarly , received their founding land grants from the national government and continue to receive millions in federal research grants and scholarship monies .
UC Berkeley can not restrict speech because of its content unless the speech causes physical injury to individuals or the public — a riot , not offended feelings . Harvard , by contrast , can suppress speech all it wants . But once Harvard accepts federal funds , under the condition that recipients not discriminate on the basis of ideology , it has placed itself under the same obligations to respect speech as public schools . While the Framers might not have understood the Constitution ’ s spending clause to include the massive educational-grant programs of our time , so long as colleges and universities accept the funds , they must accept the nondiscrimination conditions attached .
It would be a different world if the Court returned to the original meaning of the free-speech clause . Some “ speech ” would not be as protected . Other speech would be more protected . And other constitutional clauses could be restored to their original meaning and again have some reason for existing . That will be the mission of the Roberts Court , just as much for free speech as for other rights .

For example, the Court’s freedom of association limits constitutional protection through adjectives: “expressive” or “intimate.” But there are no qualifiers in front of the Constitution’s prohibition on “abridging . . . the right of the people peaceably to assemble.” All types of assembly are protected, as long as they are peaceable. In fact, the Congress that passed the First Amendment rejected an attempt to add the limiting language “and consult for the common good” to the freedom of assembly.

Likewise, as Inazu has pointed out, by treating the right of assembly as derivative of the right to speak freely, the analysis turns on the what of a message rather than the who or the where of assembly. This enables government discrimination among groups so long as it is “reasonable” and a group’s message is not targeted.

According to the original meaning unearthed by Inazu, the right to assembly is also broader than free speech because it protects a group’s right to use public space for gatherings. The original right further protected the right to plan an assembly via perpetual associations that controlled the selection of their own leaders. Christian student groups would no longer have to accept a leader, as required by many colleges and universities, who does not agree with their religious beliefs. Thus, as Michael McConnell has argued, much “is lost when the courts reduce the freedom of groups to a freedom of speech and protect groups only from regulations that would impair their public messages.”

The freedoms of press and petition are stand-alone rights just as much as the right to assembly. If the free-speech clause were as broad as the Court now reads it, these rights would have been redundant. But, as Chief Justice John Marshall reminded us in the foundational McCullough v. Maryland, every word of the Constitution must have a meaning. Just as the Court has incorrectly expanded federal power under the commerce clause so as to make Congress’s other constitutional powers redundant, so too has the free-speech clause grown past its original confines to render irrelevant other constitutional provisions. To give meaning to the press, petition, and assembly clauses, we must restore a narrower scope of the free-speech clause’s original meaning.

The Framers believed that the freedom to speak, write, and publish were natural rights. The government could not regulate speech unless it directly injured others. But, as Jud Campbell has recently shown, this allowed the state to regulate speech that misled or directly harmed others, such as “libel, defamation, conspiracy, threats, profanity, blasphemy, perjury, sedition, and so forth.”

Nor did the Framers believe the right to free speech included “expressive conduct.” Thus, for instance, some Founders criticized theater bans not because they infringed speech, but rather because they infringed the natural right to spend one’s time and money as one pleased. In the mid-1790s, some argued that the raising of liberty poles was protected speech, but such views were the minority position.

Some scholars, such as Yale law professor Akhil Amar, take the even narrower view that the free-speech clause stemmed from traditional protections for the official speech and debate of legislators. Article II, section 6, clause 1 protects official speech in Congress: “and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place.” Thus, Amar argues, the First Amendment’s use of the word speech should also be understood as protecting only similar speech. Whatever James Madison and the other Framers’ intentions, however, the constitutional text protects just “speech,” rather than “political speech” or “legislative speech or debate.”

Modern Controversies

Ironically, while the Court has diverged from the First Amendment’s original meaning by watering down the definition of speech, the Court has determined that commercial speech deserves lesser protection. But again, the Constitution makes no distinction between types of speech. Speech is speech under the First Amendment, whether political, religious, commercial, ideological, academic, or other. The only way that commercial speech could receive less protection under the Constitution is, under the natural-rights framework, because it is more prone to certain harm than other types of speech, and thus can trigger government regulation. But that’s a correlation, not a categorical distinction — and must be determined case by case.

Given this original meaning, some of the Court’s canonical, if not controversial, free-speech decisions have wandered far beyond the Constitution’s text and history. Certainly the Court’s 1972 decision finding a constitutional right to nude dancing is wrong (California v. LaRue). Similarly, Texas v. Johnson, in which the Court concluded that flag burning is speech, is also probably wrong.

Restricting free speech to just that — speech — rather than conduct, cuts both ways. For example, liberals want sexual orientation to be speech. Conservatives want cake baking to be speech. Neither would have constituted speech at the time of the ratification of the Bill of Rights. The Constitution’s original meaning is not necessarily conservative or liberal.

Conservatives have arguably pushed an erroneous free-speech argument as to why limits on campaign contributions, such as those upheld in Buckley v. Valeo, violate the First Amendment. They sometimes reason that financial contributions facilitate candidate speech; thus, limiting donations unconstitutionally limits speech. And in McCutcheon v. FEC, the Supreme Court struck down overall limits on how much an individual may donate to compaigns (though it left in place limits on how much an individual may donate to a single candidate), arguing that donations constitute both “political expression” and “political association.”

We think the Founders might have disagreed that money equals speech. Money facilitates speech. So does a megaphone, or a personal computer. Nor does all money constitute speech; we do not speak when we buy an apple at the supermarket. Not all money given to candidates even goes towards electoral speech.

It would be different if a law banned spending money on speech directly by individuals or entities. Imagine a law making it illegal to buy billboard space or take out an ad in a newspaper. Such a law prohibits spending money to speak in a forum that one has to first pay to use. This would violate the free-speech clause.

Still, that doesn’t mean conservative arguments are wrong regarding the constitutionality of campaign-contribution laws. These arguments just look at the wrong part of the Constitution.

The first question one should always ask in constitutional analysis is: Under which enumerated power did Congress act? No doubt Congress claims its authority to regulate campaign contributions derived from its power to regulate “The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives.”

Notice, though, that Congress is not authorized to regulate campaigns, but the “times, places, and manner of holding elections.” As research on the framing suggests, regulating the manner of holding elections only included the actual running of the election, such as whether to have secret or voice voting, not the campaign leading up to the election. McCutcheon may have reached the right result but taken the wrong path by neglecting to demand constitutional authority for the federal campaign laws.

What is more, there may be a free-press problem with some campaign-finance statutes, such as the one struck down in Citizens United. That statute prevented corporations from paying for a political ad within 30 days of a campaign election. Today’s television, radio, and Internet ads are the equivalent of the pamphlets and handbills of 18th-century politics. It’s hard to believe that the founding generation would have understood the Constitution to tolerate a government ban on private ownership of printing presses, or the prevention of the use of money to buy them. Citizens United makes more sense under the original understanding of the First Amendment as a protection of the right to a free press than as a right to make unlimited campaign contributions.

The Future

The Court’s errant course will leave it at sea for the most important free-speech issues coming over the horizon. While past cases focused on whether cities could ban nude dancing or the government could stop flag burning, future cases will ask whether the First Amendment regulates the most important arenas for the communication of ideas today: universities and the Internet.

Traditional paradigms of free-speech cases involve the government pretextually using neutral laws to target unpopular views. But our future controversies will not fit that familiar form. Congressional hearings have already sought to determine whether Facebook, Google, and Twitter have suppressed speech by conservatives. Universities have attempted to prevent controversial conservatives from speaking on campus, punished conservative professors for their speech (including in the classroom), or generally suppressed conservative student groups’ attempt to communicate to the greater campus a message that does not stick to the views of the liberal orthodoxy. Corporate chieftains or university presidents will play the censors of the future.

Does this violate the free-speech clause? Under its original meaning, often not. The clause applies only to government actors, so it wouldn’t apply to private companies or private universities, just public ones. On the other hand, both the Internet and universities are intertwined with the government. The federal government created the Internet and provides important support for its operation, such as protecting Internet firms from liability and excessive state regulation. Many universities, similarly, received their founding land grants from the national government and continue to receive millions in federal research grants and scholarship monies.

UC Berkeley cannot restrict speech because of its content unless the speech causes physical injury to individuals or the public — a riot, not offended feelings. Harvard, by contrast, can suppress speech all it wants. But once Harvard accepts federal funds, under the condition that recipients not discriminate on the basis of ideology, it has placed itself under the same obligations to respect speech as public schools. While the Framers might not have understood the Constitution’s spending clause to include the massive educational-grant programs of our time, so long as colleges and universities accept the funds, they must accept the nondiscrimination conditions attached.

It would be a different world if the Court returned to the original meaning of the free-speech clause. Some “speech” would not be as protected. Other speech would be more protected. And other constitutional clauses could be restored to their original meaning and again have some reason for existing. That will be the mission of the Roberts Court, just as much for free speech as for other rights.

So you 're telling me that it 's now just a fashion accessory and not a religious thing ? Or are you just trying to get women used to being oppressed under Islam ? ''
MWA also took issue when Zhu tweeted , `` Did you know the majority of black deaths are caused by other blacks ? Fix problems within your own community before blaming others , '' according to the Detroit Free Press .
Zhu serves as the vice president of the College Republicans student group at the University of Michigan . The former Miss Michigan told a group of Bloomfield , Michigan Republicans about her `` coming out '' as a conservative in high school , according to the website Michigan Live .
`` After I came out as a conservative , which I think is very hard to do nowadays – it 's harder than coming out as openly gay , '' she told the group . `` Ever since junior year , I 've been ridiculed online , bullied online , on Twitter and Facebook . … People ( told me ) I was a white supremacist , even though I 'm Asian . I do n't know why that 's even a thing . ''
Zhu said she has mostly received support during the controversy which has been reported by several media outlets .
She said she stands behind her comments and would refuse the crown if the MWA reversed its decision .
`` If they were to ( offer the crown back ) I would n't want to take it , '' she told Michigan Live . `` I would rather be real about my stances and my beliefs than to than to back down and say , 'yeah , I 'll accept this crown . ' ''
Zhu said she likes President Trump because he expresses what he believes .
`` I think that Trump is a very big role model for a lot of people because he openly expresses what he believes in , '' Zhu said . `` I think that for me to stand here as an Asian-American , to come here and say , ' I am a conservative , I support Trump , ' I guess the left finds it hysterical that I 'm doing this , but a lot of people have reached out to me and said 'you inspired me to be a conservative , ' and I 'm so glad I was able to do that . ''","Just a week after Kathy Zhu was stripped of her Miss Michigan crown by Miss World America (MWA) pageant officials because of her tweets that the organization claimed were ""inappropriate,"" she strengthened her resolve telling an audience of Trump supporters, ""It's harder to come out as conservative than gay.""

As CBN News reported, the MWA took away Zhu's crown over several social media posts that the organization said contained offensive, insensitive and inappropriate content.

That was especially fitting in the wake of the 60 Minutes Stormy Daniels interview . As I pointed out in my column last week , Judge Starr was the special counsel ( then called “ independent counsel ” ) whose jurisdiction to investigate the Clintons ’ involvement in the Whitewater scheme was expanded in 1998 to include President Clinton ’ s Monica Lewinsky scandal . Starr is a good person to consult regarding the possibility that today ’ s special counsel , Robert Mueller , may expand his Russia probe to investigate whether laws were broken in the cover-up of President Trump ’ s alleged relationship with Daniels ( whose real name is Stephanie Clifford ) .
Starr ’ s erudition , good cheer , and practical experience in the independent-counsel role , coupled with the reporters ’ sharp questions , makes the whole interview worth your while . I want to home in , though , on the discussion of obstruction .
It was broad-ranging , with Isikoff and Klaidman probing along the now-familiar line of anti-Trump thinking that a president could be charged with obstruction based even on ostensibly lawful acts — such as issuing pardons to potential witnesses like Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort — if a prosecutor could credibly allege a corrupt intent .
Starr essentially rejected this proposition , theorizing that obstruction , particularly in the pardon context , would have to be based on illegal acts ( such as bribery ) . Under the Constitution , the executive ’ s pardon power is plenary ; it is not supposed to be judicially reviewable and the president does not need a reason to extend clemency . Therefore , Starr reasoned , we should presume that the president pardons for legitimate reasons ( e.g. , based on his sincere belief that the prosecution was overbearing or that the pardon petitioner was innocent ) unless there is a patently criminal inducement . ( The podcast recounted Clinton ’ s pardons of Susan McDougal and some other potential witnesses against him whom Starr had prosecuted . )
I agree with Judge Starr . Having made a similar argument a number of times ( see , for instance , here and here ) , I don ’ t want to belabor the point . Instead , I want to address a slightly different variation on the anti-Trump obstruction theory , pressed by the Yahoo journalists : the notion that a president may be guilty of actionable obstruction if he attempts to “ delegitimize ” an investigation .
The issue arises due to President Trump ’ s recent barrage of tweets against Special Counsel Mueller . Trump ’ s then-attorney , John Dowd ( who has since withdrawn from his legal team ) , also called for an end to Mueller ’ s probe . Starr poured cold water on the idea that this could constitute obstruction . Recalling that he and his investigation were subjected to a relentless , often vicious delegitimation campaign by the Clinton camp , Starr observed that such attacks are protected speech in our system — lawful , even if unsavory .
I don ’ t think Starr could have been more right about this . I just want to add three points to his assessment .
First , rhetoric that aims to delegitimize the government ’ s investigation and prosecution is a staple of criminal defense . Far from obstructing justice , it is routinely part of the judicial process . I daresay that , were it not for Trump derangement , normally sensible anti-Trump critics would easily see that criminalizing such rhetoric would unconstitutionally erode the presumption of innocence .
To suggest that the prosecution may not be subjected to harsh criticism — whether or not deserved — would create a presumption of prosecutorial propriety . There is no such thing in our system ( due-process safeguards protect us from the government ; they don ’ t protect the government from us ) . If the prosecution started out with a presumption in its favor , the accused would not be presumed innocent — the presumption would be that to suspect the defendant of criminal misconduct was entirely reasonable . That would get the prosecutor at least 80 percent of the way to a conviction .
Second , it is standard fare for the defense to attack the investigators and prosecutors as corrupt or rabid at trial — i.e. , after a grand jury has already found probable cause for the charges . How , then , could it possibly be unlawful to attack the investigators and prosecutors as corrupt or rabid during the investigation ? At that early stage , no grounds for charges have been established — and in Trump ’ s specific situation , no crime predicated the investigation , and none has been demonstrated after nearly two years of digging . Moreover , it can not be that the same tactic — attempting to delegitimize the investigation — is simultaneously a felony and a common approach to criminal defense .
Third and finally , while lawful , attacking the investigation is frequently a very foolish move .
To be sure , if the prosecutor and investigators have in fact engaged in corrupt or overbearing behavior , they should be called on it . And if a defendant can demonstrate that his claims of misconduct are justified , it will redound to his benefit . Most of the time , though , such claims are fabrications or exaggerations , and when all the relevant facts are revealed , it becomes clear that the prosecution ’ s actions were within the bounds of reason .
While no one likes to be maligned , I was usually very content as a prosecutor to be attacked , for two reasons . First , if defendants were reproaching me or my agents , it signaled that they needed to distract attention from the evidence because they had no real answer for it . Second , I knew that once the proof started to be revealed , the defense claims of misconduct would be exposed as nonsense that had been intended to mislead the public and the jury . This meant the defense would lose credibility , which is close to impossible to get back . It made it much more likely that the prosecution would prevail .
In a high-profile investigation involving a suspect who can command public attention at will ( as a president can ) , I learned that it was extremely important for the prosecutor to keep pushing information into the public record . I am not talking about leaks , which are improper .

The sooner investigative information can be revealed publicly , the sooner the media will be armed with facts that counter what the suspects and their sympathizers are saying . Until that point , the suspects and their apologists are the only ones talking .
This is not always easy to do . In an investigation , building the case is paramount , and secrecy is often necessary . If investigative information is disclosed prematurely , suspects may destroy evidence , flee , tamper with witnesses , etc . And you can ’ t always rush arrests or indictments — until the prosecutor has sufficient evidence , charges must not be filed ; and even when there is enough evidence to charge one suspect , a prosecutor resists arresting any one suspect until he is in a position to charge all the suspects ( otherwise , again , there may be destruction of evidence , flight , witness-tampering , etc . ) .
But all that said , the sooner investigative information can legitimately be revealed publicly , the sooner the media ( in particular , journalists sympathetic to the prosecution or skeptical about defense claims of government misconduct ) will be armed with facts that counter what the suspects and their sympathizers are saying .

free_speech,CNN - Editorial,0,https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/10/opinions/free-speech-on-campus-roth/index.html,Free speech wars miss the point of college,2019-09-10,,"( CNN ) As the new school year gets underway and the presidential campaign heats up , it wo n't be long before we hear once again critics bewailing that free speech is no longer a core value at colleges and universities . Through a well-funded effort by conservative political organizations , already more than a dozen state legislatures have passed so-called campus free speech bills .
Major research universities will likely be under a spotlight , criticized for supposedly providing a platform for political craziness rather than innovative research , and surely there will be liberal arts college professors labeled `` illiberal liberals '' ( or worse ) before the first semester is out . Those with political beliefs they believe unpopular on campus will defend themselves by simultaneously saying they feel forced to self-censor while also calling for more freedom of expression .
Along with appeals to free speech , we will also ( paradoxically ) hear calls for civility , for soft self-censorship in the name of decorum . In fact , we already have , with Cindy McCain 's Acts of Civility initiative and in the wake of Bret Stephens ' reaction to a tweet from a George Washington professor . At a time when violent racism has become ingrained in immigration policy , at a time when hatred in public discourse has become an accepted part of national politics , it seems both naïve and inconsistent to tell college students that embracing civility along with a rough and tumble marketplace of ideas is a cure for our ills .
The unregulated free market approach to speech is not a viable path for higher education -- it 's both misleading and airily abstract . Real harm to real people results when racism and sexism amplify hateful speech . Giving a platform to overtly racist groups , or to speakers intent on targeting particular portions of a student body , is an exercise in intimidation more than intellectual debate . Nor will the free market approach likely result in giving conservative traditions more consideration on campus .
Those who simply call for `` more speech '' in the marketplace of ideas can be oblivious to the difficulties that under-represented conservative ideas face in getting a fair hearing . It 's not enough to set procedures that claim to allow anybody to come to a campus to say anything at all . For example , given the prejudicial filters for access to campus platforms , we need an affirmative action program to bring thoughtful conservative and religious scholars to institutions that pride themselves on research and selectivity . Without proactive leadership , we 'll wind up with only the occasional outrageous right-wing pseudo-scholar coming to campus to incite outraged reactions from students , followed by puffed-up indignation from opinion writers .
As I argue in Safe Enough Spaces , a deeper problem with the free market approach -- and the protests that free speech on campus is no more -- stems from a fundamental misconception about what goes on at colleges . The classroom has never been an unregulated market , and neither are scientific laboratories or academic journals . They all have procedures to ensure that inquiry and discussion are legitimately used to advance work in a particular area , and there are judgments to be made by those with qualifications about what counts as legitimate . Avoiding the appearance of making judgments by appealing to the marketplace of ideas is , at best , disingenuous .
Older liberals today making the case for free speech and civility on campus are far more likely to talk about Berkeley in the 1960s than they are to discuss the more recent weaponization of libertarian approaches to expression adopted by the courts since the Citizens United ruling protecting the speech rights of corporations . And when they talk about civility , they seem to be thinking of dinner table conversations rather than student protest . Some older liberals may wax eloquent about the Free Speech movement and People 's Park , but they rarely repeat the powerful words of its leader , Mario Savio : `` There is a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious , makes you so sick at heart , that you ca n't take part . You ca n't even passively take part ! And you 've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels , upon the levers , upon all the apparatus , and you 've got to make it stop ! '' It was n't civility this leftist icon of free speech was calling for ; it was passionate disruption .
Freedom of expression is absolutely crucial for inquiry and teaching , but many of those who wave the flag for free speech on campus today mistakenly argue that any regulation of content , even when the intention is to protect the vulnerable , puts us on a path to authoritarian censorship . The call for the free exchange of ideas at all costs is n't persuasive to many college students today who recognize that when markets are unregulated , real pollution , and sometimes lasting damage , occurs -- and that historically it 's groups that have been vulnerable who are most consistently wounded by hate speech ( and worse ) .
In the last several years , such pollution has often come from right-wing provocateurs who speak at institutions of higher learning to add credence and energy to racist , homophobic , and sexist attitudes and practices . This dynamic increases in intensity as harmful effects are repeated . When those from dominant groups or in positions of campus authority insist that this is not real harm because it 's not physical violence , or when First Amendment fundamentalists claim that any constraint on speech is a step on the slippery slope toward tyranny , we can detect the ideology of market deregulation at the heart of free speech dogmatism . Students who have seen deregulators ' bold attempts to solidify existing hierarchies recognize that power matters in regard to speech as well as other things . It 's never the case that everybody gets to speak ; not everyone gets heard .

Through a well-funded effort by conservative political organizations, already more than a dozen state legislatures have passed so-called campus free speech bills.

Major research universities will likely be under a spotlight, criticized for supposedly providing a platform for political craziness rather than innovative research, and surely there will be liberal arts college professors labeled ""illiberal liberals"" (or worse) before the first semester is out. Those with political beliefs they believe unpopular on campus will defend themselves by simultaneously saying they feel forced to self-censor while also calling for more freedom of expression.

Along with appeals to free speech, we will also (paradoxically) hear calls for civility, for soft self-censorship in the name of decorum. In fact, we already have, with Cindy McCain's Acts of Civility initiative and in the wake of Bret Stephens' reaction to a tweet from a George Washington professor. At a time when violent racism has become ingrained in immigration policy, at a time when hatred in public discourse has become an accepted part of national politics, it seems both naïve and inconsistent to tell college students that embracing civility along with a rough and tumble marketplace of ideas is a cure for our ills.

The unregulated free market approach to speech is not a viable path for higher education -- it's both misleading and airily abstract. Real harm to real people results when racism and sexism amplify hateful speech. Giving a platform to overtly racist groups, or to speakers intent on targeting particular portions of a student body, is an exercise in intimidation more than intellectual debate. Nor will the free market approach likely result in giving conservative traditions more consideration on campus.

Those who simply call for ""more speech"" in the marketplace of ideas can be oblivious to the difficulties that under-represented conservative ideas face in getting a fair hearing. It's not enough to set procedures that claim to allow anybody to come to a campus to say anything at all. For example, given the prejudicial filters for access to campus platforms, we need an affirmative action program to bring thoughtful conservative and religious scholars to institutions that pride themselves on research and selectivity. Without proactive leadership, we'll wind up with only the occasional outrageous right-wing pseudo-scholar coming to campus to incite outraged reactions from students, followed by puffed-up indignation from opinion writers.

As I argue in Safe Enough Spaces , a deeper problem with the free market approach -- and the protests that free speech on campus is no more -- stems from a fundamental misconception about what goes on at colleges. The classroom has never been an unregulated market, and neither are scientific laboratories or academic journals. They all have procedures to ensure that inquiry and discussion are legitimately used to advance work in a particular area, and there are judgments to be made by those with qualifications about what counts as legitimate. Avoiding the appearance of making judgments by appealing to the marketplace of ideas is, at best, disingenuous.

Older liberals today making the case for free speech and civility on campus are far more likely to talk about Berkeley in the 1960s than they are to discuss the more recent weaponization of libertarian approaches to expression adopted by the courts since the Citizens United ruling protecting the speech rights of corporations. And when they talk about civility, they seem to be thinking of dinner table conversations rather than student protest. Some older liberals may wax eloquent about the Free Speech movement and People's Park, but they rarely repeat the powerful words of its leader , Mario Savio: ""There is a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part. You can't even passively take part! And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make it stop!"" It wasn't civility this leftist icon of free speech was calling for; it was passionate disruption.

Freedom of expression is absolutely crucial for inquiry and teaching, but many of those who wave the flag for free speech on campus today mistakenly argue that any regulation of content, even when the intention is to protect the vulnerable, puts us on a path to authoritarian censorship. The call for the free exchange of ideas at all costs isn't persuasive to many college students today who recognize that when markets are unregulated, real pollution, and sometimes lasting damage, occurs -- and that historically it's groups that have been vulnerable who are most consistently wounded by hate speech (and worse).

In the last several years, such pollution has often come from right-wing provocateurs who speak at institutions of higher learning to add credence and energy to racist, homophobic, and sexist attitudes and practices. This dynamic increases in intensity as harmful effects are repeated. When those from dominant groups or in positions of campus authority insist that this is not real harm because it's not physical violence, or when First Amendment fundamentalists claim that any constraint on speech is a step on the slippery slope toward tyranny, we can detect the ideology of market deregulation at the heart of free speech dogmatism. Students who have seen deregulators' bold attempts to solidify existing hierarchies recognize that power matters in regard to speech as well as other things. It's never the case that everybody gets to speak; not everyone gets heard.

The task of colleges and universities is neither to produce a pure, unregulated market of ideas nor to champion the civility of the drawing room. Our task is to promote inquiry, not outrage -- to promote critical engagement, not condescension. In that regard, we have to do more to increase intellectual diversity in higher education.

free_speech,Reason,2,https://reason.com/volokh/2018/05/02/freedom-of-the-press-and-non-professiona,'Freedom of the Press' and Non-Professional-Media Speakers: Why It Matters,2018-05-02,"Eugene Volokh, Scott Shackford, David Post, Josh Blackman, Shikha Dalmia, Jacob Sullum, Elizabeth Nolan Brown, Eric Boehm, Ilya Somin, Mike Riggs","I 've been blogging recently about how `` the freedom of the press '' has long been understood as securing the freedom of all to use mass communications technology ( the printing press and its modern heirs ) and not as a freedom limited to those who belong to a favored industry ( `` the press '' in the sense of the professional media ) . Why does this matter ? Do some judges really take the latter view , and seek to exclude speakers from protection because the speakers do n't publish regularly for a living ?
Indeed they do . Let me offer just a few examples .
[ 1 . ] Restrictions on campaign-related expenditures : Many campaign finance laws have sought to limit people 's ability to spend money to support or oppose candidates . The law struck down in Buckley v. Valeo barred people generally from spending more than $ 1000 on such speech . The law struck down in Citizens United barred corporations and unions from spending any of their general treasury funds on such speech .
Now of course newspapers routinely spend money to support or oppose candidates—anything newspapers write costs money . Under any sensible accounting scheme , an editorial supporting a candidate would cost a lot in labor costs and the editorial 's share of newsprint , ink , and distribution costs . That would often far exceed $ 1000 ; and most newspapers are of course organized as corporations . Likewise for extended coverage supporting or opposing a candidate , when engaged in by an opinion magazine .
Campaign finance laws generally exempt `` broadcasting station [ s ] , newspaper [ s ] , magazine [ s ] , or other periodical publication [ s ] , '' precisely to avoid this result . But those are just statutory exemptions , created as a matter of legislative grace . What if Congress or a state legislature decided to omit any such exemption , so that on its face the law did bar expensive editorializing for or against candidates by newspapers , just as it was intended to do for other spenders ?
There are three possible answers . One—the one associated these days with conservatives—is that the First Amendment forbids all such restrictions on independent expenditures ( independent , that is to say , of the candidate ) . Newspapers are free to speak about candidates , but only because everyone is .
Another , which one might take if one were really hard-core about such restrictions , is that the First Amendment allows all such restrictions , including on newspapers , magazines , and the like . After all , if one is concerned about the influence of spending on politics , one can be equally concerned about the influence of media spending—it , too , is inegalitarian and potentially corrupting , just as others ' spending would be . But very few people are willing to go that far .
The third option , which is associated these days with many liberals , is that the First Amendment allows restrictions on spending by most speakers , but not by `` the press . '' Most speakers can be barred from spending over $ 1000 ( or some such amount ) on advocacy for or against a candidate or a ballot measure , many pro-campaign-finance-restriction advocates say—but not newspapers or magazines . Most speakers can be barred from spending corporate money on such advocacy , the argument goes ; but not newspapers or magazines .
Indeed , consider Justice Stevens ' dissent ( for four Justices ) in Citizens United . Justice Scalia 's concurrence argued that , `` under the Government 's reasoning '' supporting the ban on corporate independent spending for or against candidates , `` wealthy media corporations could have their voices diminished to put them on par with other media entities . '' No , said the dissent :
It is a claim about what the text of the First Amendment meant to its drafters , so originalist evidence is important to it . ( Justice Stevens , like many Justices , views original meaning as highly relevant , though not dispositive . ) It is a claim about the Free Press Clause providing special protection to the press-as-industry ( speakers `` that are part of the press '' ) rather than to all who use the press-as-technology . It is , in this passage , a claim specifically about the press-as-industry-vs.-technology issue , and not the separate issues of how the Framers would have viewed the rights of corporations , or how they would have viewed the right to spend money . ( Those are interesting and important historical questions , but ones that I 'm not focusing on in these posts , or in my article . )
And I think the evidence I 've been pointing to is relevant to evaluating Justice Stevens ' argument . If I 'm right that the freedom of the press was understood at the time of the Framing as protecting people who write one-off books or pamphlets as much as those who are in the business of publishing , then it would analogously protect speakers such as Citizens United ( who make occasional videos rather ) as much as day-to-day cable broadcasters . If I 'm right that the freedom of the press was understood as covering those who submitted items to newspapers , or bought ads in newspapers , as much as the newspaper publishers themselves—and I 'll cite some such early cases in upcoming posts—then it would likewise cover those who spend , say , $ 5000 on a political ad in a newspaper as much as it would cover editors who spend $ 5000 on a political editorial in a newspaper .
Now maybe you think Justice Stevens is right on the history here and I 'm wrong ; or maybe you think the history does n't matter , and Justice Stevens is right for other reasons . But passages such as the one I quote show that people are arguing that the First Amendment 's text and history shows that the press-as-industry should get special protection , so that the modern analogs of Framing-era book authors , pamphleteers , newspaper advertisers , and the like should indeed get lesser protection that does the institutional press .
[ 2 . ] Limitations on libel law protections . The Supreme Court has , since 1964 , developed a set of important protections for speakers who are sued for libel . Should all these protections be available for all speakers , rather than being reserved just for those who are members of the institutional press and denied to one-off speakers ? The great bulk of modern lower court cases say yes , they should be available for all . The Supreme Court has also said yes : Five Justices took that view in a libel case , Dun & Bradstreet v. Greenmoss Builders ( 1985 ) , and though that was n't binding precedent ( since some of those five Justices were dissenting , and the formal rule is that dissenters are n't usually counted for precedential purposes ) , the Citizens United majority expressly endorsed it . Five Supreme Court cases from 1979 to 1990 noted that the question was unresolved then , but it is resolved now .
Still , there are a few lower court decisions starting with the 1970s that deny non-professional-media speakers the First Amendment protections that professional media speakers get . For instance , a 1981 Virginia Supreme Court decision concluded that a real estate developer who bought a newspaper ad to criticize a citizen opponent of a development project was a `` non-media defendant , '' and thus was n't protected under the Gertz v. Robert Welch , Inc. rule ( under which plaintiffs in such cases ca n't recover presumed or punitive damages absent a showing of `` actual malice '' ) . A 1979 Oregon Supreme Court case and a 2007 federal district court case held the same as to a authors of letters to the editor . A 2005 Michigan appellate case held the same as to a professor who posted material on his website . A 2006 federal district court case held that an author of a self-published book could n't assert First Amendment defenses because she was n't a member of the media . Five more cases took the same view as to people 's statements to reporters or interviewers . And the Minnesota case that indirectly prompted this recent series of posts took a similar view as to a nonprofit organization 's newsletter , and a woman who wrote one article for that newsletter .
Again , these speakers are closely analogous to Framing-era book authors , pamphleteers , and writers who submitted articles or ads to newspapers . If my analysis is right , and one thinks that historical understandings of the freedom of the press matter ( both such understandings from the Framing era , and from the rest of American history , which I 'll discuss soon ) , then these cases are mistaken in treating the professional media differently for First Amendment purposes from other users of mass communication technology .
[ 3 . ] The newsgatherer 's privilege . Federal courts have also debated whether journalists and others who gather information for publication should have a limited First Amendment privilege to refuse to disclose the identities of their confidential sources ( and sometimes other information ) . Branzburg v. Hayes ( 1972 ) rejected such a privilege , and in the process rejected the view that the professional media has special First Amendment rights . But many lower courts have recognized such a privilege nonetheless , based ( I think incorrectly ) on some language in Justice Powell 's concurrence . ( Note that many newsgatherer 's privilege claims are brought not under the First Amendment but under special statutes that provide extra protection ; some such statutes are limited to professional journalists , but that is a separate question from the one I 'm discussing here . )
As it happens , nearly all the cases that have recognized such a First Amendment privilege have extended it to all who gather information for publication , including would-be book authors , professors doing research for a possible future article , a film student and a professor trying to produce a documentary film , a political candidate , and political advocacy groups . The common threshold requirement seems to be that the newsgatherer , `` at the inception of the investigatory process , had the intent to disseminate to the public the information obtained through the investigation . '' The newsgatherer need not be a member of the press-as-industry . But one case ( a 1979 New York intermediate appellate court decision ) disagreed , and held that book authors were n't covered . Here too the evidence I gather may be relevant to the analysis , to the extent courts care about such historical evidence .
I hope , then , that this shows that the debate I 'm discussing—how was the `` freedom of the press '' historically understood ? —continues , and that the particular evidence I 'm introducing is potentially helpful : Whether or not , say , book authors or pamphleteers or advertisers were viewed as covered , even though they were n't professional members of `` the press , '' may bear on analogous questions today .","I've been blogging recently about how ""the freedom of the press"" has long been understood as securing the freedom of all to use mass communications technology (the printing press and its modern heirs) and not as a freedom limited to those who belong to a favored industry (""the press"" in the sense of the professional media).

Likewise for extended coverage supporting or opposing a candidate, when engaged in by an opinion magazine.

Campaign finance laws generally exempt ""broadcasting station[s], newspaper[s], magazine[s], or other periodical publication[s],"" precisely to avoid this result. But those are just statutory exemptions, created as a matter of legislative grace. What if Congress or a state legislature decided to omit any such exemption, so that on its face the law did bar expensive editorializing for or against candidates by newspapers, just as it was intended to do for other spenders?

But very few people are willing to go that far.

Justice Scalia's concurrence argued that, ""under the Government's reasoning"" supporting the ban on corporate independent spending for or against candidates, ""wealthy media corporations could have their voices diminished to put them on par with other media entities."" No, said the dissent:

Justice Scalia would seemingly read out the Free Press Clause [from the First Amendment]: How else could he claim that my purported views on newspapers must track my views on corporations generally? [Footnote:] In fact, the Free Press Clause might be turned against Justice Scalia, for two reasons. First, we learn from it that the drafters of the First Amendment did draw distinctions—explicit distinctions—between types of ""speakers,"" or speech outlets or forms. Second, the Court's strongest historical evidence all relates to the Framers' views on the press, yet while the Court tries to sweep this evidence into the Free Speech Clause, the Free Press Clause provides a more natural textual home. The text and history highlighted by our colleagues suggests why one type of corporation, those that are part of the press, might be able to claim special First Amendment status, and therefore why some kinds of ""identity""-based distinctions might be permissible after all. Once one accepts that much, the intellectual edifice of the majority opinion crumbles.

Note the nature of Justice Stevens' argument:

It is a claim about what the text of the First Amendment meant to its drafters, so originalist evidence is important to it. (Justice Stevens, like many Justices, views original meaning as highly relevant, though not dispositive.) It is a claim about the Free Press Clause providing special protection to the press-as-industry (speakers ""that are part of the press"") rather than to all who use the press-as-technology. It is, in this passage, a claim specifically about the press-as-industry-vs.-technology issue, and not the separate issues of how the Framers would have viewed the rights of corporations, or how they would have viewed the right to spend money. (Those are interesting and important historical questions, but ones that I'm not focusing on in these posts, or in my article.)

And I think the evidence I've been pointing to is relevant to evaluating Justice Stevens' argument. If I'm right that the freedom of the press was understood at the time of the Framing as protecting people who write one-off books or pamphlets as much as those who are in the business of publishing, then it would analogously protect speakers such as Citizens United (who make occasional videos rather) as much as day-to-day cable broadcasters. If I'm right that the freedom of the press was understood as covering those who submitted items to newspapers, or bought ads in newspapers, as much as the newspaper publishers themselves—and I'll cite some such early cases in upcoming posts—then it would likewise cover those who spend, say, $5000 on a political ad in a newspaper as much as it would cover editors who spend $5000 on a political editorial in a newspaper.

Now maybe you think Justice Stevens is right on the history here and I'm wrong; or maybe you think the history doesn't matter, and Justice Stevens is right for other reasons.

Other purged pages included Cop Block , which is critical of law-enforcement practices , conservative Right Wing News , and progressive Reverb Press . Photography Is Not a Crime , which advocates for the right to record government officials in public places , was `` severely restricted , '' according to former Reasoner Radley Balko .
Facebook accused the hundreds of pages it purged of distributing `` spam , '' though the social media company used a curious definition of the word .

Such selective treatment was reportedly a result not of official policy , but of workers marinating in a shared mindset that affected their judgment .
Concern over that shared mindset inspired senior Facebook engineer Brian Amerige to complain in an August 2018 message to co-workers that `` We are a political monoculture that 's intolerant of different views . '' He added , `` We claim to welcome all perspectives , but are quick to attack — often in mobs — anyone who presents a view that appears to be in opposition to left-leaning ideology . ''

But the timing appears to have been coincidental , and perhaps just more evidence of the controlling direction in which the company is moving .
`` I do n't have much context on this one , '' Amerige told me about the purge , `` and it was n't specifically related to my departure , no . ''
But if earlier concerns were about left-wing bias , the latest purge seems to represent more of a bias in favor of establishment voices .

The establishment may be battered , but it 's not out , and muzzling anti-establishment voices could well look like a safe bet .
`` We 've accepted the inevitability of government regulation , '' Amerige lamented in his resignation letter . `` Our policy strategy is pragmatism—not clear , implementable long-term principles—and our PR strategy is appeasement—not morally earned pride and self-defense . ''
And if Facebook manages to net a few more eyeballs for its own advertising instead of losing them to other websites , so be it .
Many of the purged pages have their own websites , and they 're scrambling to find other platforms for disseminating their messages .

free_speech,Christian Science Monitor,1,https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2017/0825/Free-speech-challenge-Can-First-and-Second-Amendments-be-exercised-simultaneously,Free-speech challenge: Can First and Second Amendments be exercised simultaneously?,2017-08-25,Henry Gass,"The year was 1977 , and a group of neo-Nazis wanted to march through Skokie , Ill. – a Chicago suburb where , at the time , one out of every six Jewish residents was either a Holocaust survivor or directly related to one .
The American Civil Liberties Union successfully argued that the march should be allowed , despite the town ’ s vehement objections . ( The rally was ultimately moved to Chicago . ) Its defense of free speech , even when it qualifies as hate speech , cost the ACLU about 30,000 members – but the organization stayed consistent with a policy it held since the late 1930s .
Last week , though , the ACLU decided to change that policy in response to a violent white supremacist protest in Charlottesville , Va . Dozens of protesters marched through the town with guns – some armed better than police , according to state officials – illustrating a troubling new challenge for First Amendment guardians : what to do now when people want to exercise their right to protest at the same time as their right to openly carry guns in public ?
“ The Charlottesville events have triggered a classic American debate that has been part of our constitutional conversation for well over 100 years , ” says Rodney Smolla , dean of Widener University Delaware Law School .
“ You have the right to engage in racist speech , and there may be a state legal right to carry a gun , but when you put the two together in a mass demonstration you create a dangerous combination , ” he adds .
The intertwining of the First and Second Amendments is not unheard of in the US ( perhaps most famously with the Black Panthers in the 1970s , which led to gun control laws being enacted in states such as California ) . Today , though , 46 states have some form of open-carry laws on the books – complicating the debate , according to legal scholars . For its part , the ACLU says it is trying to adapt to the times .
Prior to the Charlottesville rally , the ACLU of Virginia successfully defended rally organizers when the town went to court to have it moved to a location outside the town center . The rally turned violent – with 35 people reported injured and a woman killed , police say , after a neo-Nazi sympathizer drove his car into a crowd – and was declared an unlawful assembly . Days later – after widespread public condemnation , including among its own members – the national organization announced that it will now not defend groups seeking to march with firearms .
They will also “ screen clients more closely for violence at their rallies , ” executive director Anthony Romero told The Wall Street Journal .
“ It ’ s neither a blanket no or a blanket yes , ” Mr. Romero added , saying the ACLU will continue to deal with requests on a case-by-case basis . But the events of Charlottesville , he said , require “ any legal group to look at the facts of any white supremacy protests with a much finer comb . ”
The shifting legal landscape around gun rights is what makes today ’ s free speech debate so much tougher for groups like the ACLU , experts say .
“ The simple dedication to the principles of free speech become a little more murky when people are carrying guns , ” says William Marshall , the Kenan Professor of Law at the University of North Carolina ( UNC ) .
“ You can be a strong believer in Second Amendment rights and a strong believer in First Amendment rights , but even if you are you might want to think about how those two work together in highly volatile demonstrations , ” he adds .
Ahead of two protests by the self-described `` alt-right '' this weekend in California , ACLU affiliates in California released their own separate statement headlined , “ White Supremacist Violence Is Not Free Speech . ”
“ If white supremacists march into our towns armed to the teeth and with the intent to harm people they are not engaging in activity protected by the United States Constitution , ” the statement concluded .
In Charlottesville , dozens of civilians carried semi-automatic weapons during the protest . Some “ had better equipment than our state police , ” Virginia Gov . Terry McAuliffe ( D ) said , while critics suggested the heavily armed protesters made police too afraid to intervene .
But an early consensus among free speech scholars is beginning to emerge that a protest with guns can not be treated , for First Amendment purposes , the same as a rally without guns .
“ A march or rally by people who are heavily armed is not an exercise of what the First Amendment calls ‘ the right of the people peaceably to assemble , ’ ” writes Michael Dorf , a professor at Cornell Law School in Ithaca , N.Y. , in the Take Care blog .
Aspiring protesters can “ as individuals , exercise their putative Second Amendment right to carry arms in public or they can , as a group , exercise their First Amendment right to peaceable assemble … in which they are not armed , ” he adds . “ The attempt to combine those two rights will , in the typical case , be unprotected . ”
Exactly how rallies with guns should be treated by courts remains to be seen . This legal terrain is complicated even further by the fact that there isn ’ t yet a definitive Supreme Court ruling regarding the right to carry guns in public .
Both the Heller ( 2008 ) and the McDonald ( 2010 ) decisions – the most recent Second Amendment cases heard by the high court – avoided answering whether Americans are allowed to openly carry guns in public . Last term , the justices declined to take up a case out of California that would have directly addressed it .
Samuel Walker , an emeritus professor at the University of Nebraska and a former ACLU board member , says the ACLU needs to keep protecting free speech for even the most extreme groups because “ social progress has advanced in part because our law protects strong and often offensive language. ” But he also agrees with the new change in policy .
“ It ’ s a new aspect of this whole ongoing controversy , ” says Professor Walker , author of “ In Defense of American Liberties , ” a history of the ACLU . “ I do not think the ACLU should defend any demonstration or march where protesters plan to carry guns . ”
The boundaries of free speech have been evolving in the United States for more than 100 years .
Prior to World War II , the country was much tougher on offensive speech . In 1919 , the US Supreme Court ruled that speaking out against the draft was not protected by the First Amendment , and in 1942 the justices ruled that “ fighting words ” ( words that “ inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace ” ) are not protected either .
Since then , the views of Justices Oliver Wendell Holmes and Louis Brandeis have prevailed . ( At least in the public square . In areas such as schools and government buildings there are more restrictions on free speech . ) Those justices believed “ that the good speech will drown out the bad speech ” in the “ marketplace of ideas , ” says Professor Smolla , author of “ Free Speech in an Open Society . ”
So as it stands , as far as the First Amendment is concerned , free speech includes hate speech . Unlike in Europe , “ hate speech ” has no legal definition in America .
The ACLU ’ s commitment to defending free speech rights is driven by the concern that carving out exceptions , even for the most repulsive language , could later be used to censor other , more acceptable , forms of speech .
Yet it ’ s that position that has provoked ire – even among some members – time and again . There 's also a shift among younger Americans regarding the importance of protecting offensive speech : 40 percent of Millennials believe the federal government should be able to limit speech offensive to minorities , according to a 2015 survey by the Pew Research Center .
Even prior to Charlottesville , the ACLU had been under fire internally over its decision to defend Milo Yiannopoulos , a high-profile figure in the self-proclaimed “ alt right ” – a coalition that combines white nationalism , anti-Semitism , and populism – in a dispute with the Washington , D.C. , public transportation authority . The authority had refused to display his ads on public transit . ( Mr. Yiannopoulos is one of several plaintiffs in the case , including Carafem , a group that helps women access birth control and medication abortions ; People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ; and the ACLU itself . )
Many have called on supporters to stop donating to the organization . A board member of the ACLU of Virginia , Waldo Jaquith , resigned after the Charlottesville protests , tweeting that he “ won ’ t be a fig leaf for the Nazis . ”
What ’ s legal and what ’ s right are sometimes different . I won ’ t be a fig leaf for Nazis . — Waldo Jaquith ( @ waldojaquith ) August 13 , 2017
We need the ACLU . We need it * so much * . But we also need it to change , just a tiny bit : don ’ t defend Nazis to allow them to kill people . — Waldo Jaquith ( @ waldojaquith ) August 13 , 2017
The ACLU ’ s new tack leaves untouched the principle that hate speech is constitutionally protected – a principle some on the left are again calling into question – but the new dynamic introduced by shifting and still unsettled gun rights laws may introduce another boundary to America ’ s unique free speech protections in the future .
“ The way the Second Amendment and First Amendment intertwine is really a new area of law , ” says Professor Marshall , from UNC . “ I think anyone approaching this area is sitting back and trying to think about what the ramifications are . ”","The year was 1977, and a group of neo-Nazis wanted to march through Skokie, Ill. – a Chicago suburb where, at the time, one out of every six Jewish residents was either a Holocaust survivor or directly related to one.

Prior to the Charlottesville rally, the ACLU of Virginia successfully defended rally organizers when the town went to court to have it moved to a location outside the town center. The rally turned violent – with 35 people reported injured and a woman killed, police say, after a neo-Nazi sympathizer drove his car into a crowd – and was declared an unlawful assembly. Days later – after widespread public condemnation, including among its own members – the national organization announced that it will now not defend groups seeking to march with firearms.

They will also “screen clients more closely for violence at their rallies,” executive director Anthony Romero told The Wall Street Journal.

“It’s neither a blanket no or a blanket yes,” Mr. Romero added, saying the ACLU will continue to deal with requests on a case-by-case basis. But the events of Charlottesville, he said, require “any legal group to look at the facts of any white supremacy protests with a much finer comb.”

The shifting legal landscape around gun rights is what makes today’s free speech debate so much tougher for groups like the ACLU, experts say.

“The simple dedication to the principles of free speech become a little more murky when people are carrying guns,” says William Marshall, the Kenan Professor of Law at the University of North Carolina (UNC).

“You can be a strong believer in Second Amendment rights and a strong believer in First Amendment rights, but even if you are you might want to think about how those two work together in highly volatile demonstrations,” he adds.

Ahead of two protests by the self-described ""alt-right"" this weekend in California, ACLU affiliates in California released their own separate statement headlined, “White Supremacist Violence Is Not Free Speech.”

“If white supremacists march into our towns armed to the teeth and with the intent to harm people they are not engaging in activity protected by the United States Constitution,” the statement concluded.

In Charlottesville, dozens of civilians carried semi-automatic weapons during the protest. Some “had better equipment than our state police,” Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) said, while critics suggested the heavily armed protesters made police too afraid to intervene.

But an early consensus among free speech scholars is beginning to emerge that a protest with guns cannot be treated, for First Amendment purposes, the same as a rally without guns.

“A march or rally by people who are heavily armed is not an exercise of what the First Amendment calls ‘the right of the people peaceably to assemble,’” writes Michael Dorf, a professor at Cornell Law School in Ithaca, N.Y., in the Take Care blog.

Aspiring protesters can “as individuals, exercise their putative Second Amendment right to carry arms in public or they can, as a group, exercise their First Amendment right to peaceable assemble … in which they are not armed,” he adds. “The attempt to combine those two rights will, in the typical case, be unprotected.”

Exactly how rallies with guns should be treated by courts remains to be seen. This legal terrain is complicated even further by the fact that there isn’t yet a definitive Supreme Court ruling regarding the right to carry guns in public.

Both the Heller (2008) and the McDonald (2010) decisions – the most recent Second Amendment cases heard by the high court – avoided answering whether Americans are allowed to openly carry guns in public. Last term, the justices declined to take up a case out of California that would have directly addressed it.

Samuel Walker, an emeritus professor at the University of Nebraska and a former ACLU board member, says the ACLU needs to keep protecting free speech for even the most extreme groups because “social progress has advanced in part because our law protects strong and often offensive language.” But he also agrees with the new change in policy.

“It’s a new aspect of this whole ongoing controversy,” says Professor Walker, author of “In Defense of American Liberties,” a history of the ACLU. “I do not think the ACLU should defend any demonstration or march where protesters plan to carry guns.”

Shifting boundaries of free speech

The boundaries of free speech have been evolving in the United States for more than 100 years.

Prior to World War II, the country was much tougher on offensive speech. In 1919, the US Supreme Court ruled that speaking out against the draft was not protected by the First Amendment, and in 1942 the justices ruled that “fighting words” (words that “inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace”) are not protected either.

Since then, the views of Justices Oliver Wendell Holmes and Louis Brandeis have prevailed. (At least in the public square. In areas such as schools and government buildings there are more restrictions on free speech.) Those justices believed “that the good speech will drown out the bad speech” in the “marketplace of ideas,” says Professor Smolla, author of “Free Speech in an Open Society.”

So as it stands, as far as the First Amendment is concerned, free speech includes hate speech. Unlike in Europe, “hate speech” has no legal definition in America.

The ACLU’s commitment to defending free speech rights is driven by the concern that carving out exceptions, even for the most repulsive language, could later be used to censor other, more acceptable, forms of speech.

Yet it’s that position that has provoked ire – even among some members – time and again. There's also a shift among younger Americans regarding the importance of protecting offensive speech: 40 percent of Millennials believe the federal government should be able to limit speech offensive to minorities, according to a 2015 survey by the Pew Research Center.

Even prior to Charlottesville, the ACLU had been under fire internally over its decision to defend Milo Yiannopoulos, a high-profile figure in the self-proclaimed “alt right” – a coalition that combines white nationalism, anti-Semitism, and populism – in a dispute with the Washington, D.C., public transportation authority. The authority had refused to display his ads on public transit. (Mr. Yiannopoulos is one of several plaintiffs in the case, including Carafem, a group that helps women access birth control and medication abortions; People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals; and the ACLU itself.)

But Charlottesville triggered a much larger backlash.

Many have called on supporters to stop donating to the organization. A board member of the ACLU of Virginia, Waldo Jaquith, resigned after the Charlottesville protests, tweeting that he “won’t be a fig leaf for the Nazis.”

I just resigned from the ACLU of Virginia board.



What’s legal and what’s right are sometimes different. I won’t be a fig leaf for Nazis. — Waldo Jaquith (@waldojaquith) August 13, 2017

We need the ACLU. We need it *so much*. But we also need it to change, just a tiny bit: don’t defend Nazis to allow them to kill people. — Waldo Jaquith (@waldojaquith) August 13, 2017

The ACLU’s new tack leaves untouched the principle that hate speech is constitutionally protected – a principle some on the left are again calling into question – but the new dynamic introduced by shifting and still unsettled gun rights laws may introduce another boundary to America’s unique free speech protections in the future.

“The way the Second Amendment and First Amendment intertwine is really a new area of law,” says Professor Marshall, from UNC. “I think anyone approaching this area is sitting back and trying to think about what the ramifications are.”",www.csmonitor.com,center,shFVkT3p1dBELlCg

""The Proud Boys contacted us or contacted the units on the ground saying that they wanted to leave and so we facilitated for them to leave the area,"" Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office Sgt. Brandon White told the newspaper. ""It wasn’t planned. It wasn’t orchestrated. We had a request that they would like to leave the area and so we facilitated.""

But hundreds of people remained downtown and on nearby streets, and there were skirmishes throughout the day. At around 4:15 p.m., police declared a gathering of mostly left-wing protesters near Pioneer Courthouse Square a ""civil disturbance"" and told people to leave.

Later in the afternoon, The Oregonian also reported that a group of left-wing counter-demonstrators had surrounded two people wearing American flag-themed clothing and were ""taunting, threatening, and chasing them.""

Among those attending the demonstration was Patriot Prayer's Joey Gibson, who organized similar rallies in 2017 and 2018 that erupted in clashes. Gibson surrendered Friday on an arrest warrant for felony rioting but was released on bail hours later.

""I’m just here for the ride,"" Gibson told The Oregonian.

Organizer Joe Biggs told the paper that the demonstrators ""wanted national attention and we got it.""

""Go look at President Trump’s Twitter,” Biggs said. “He talked about Portland, said he’s watching Antifa. That’s all we wanted ... Mission success.""

President Trump tweeted Saturday morning that he is considering designating Antifa a domestic terror group.

""Major consideration is being given to naming ANTIFA an ‘ORGANIZATION OF TERROR,’” Trump said. “Portland is being watched very closely. Hopefully the Mayor will be able to properly do his job!”

Late Saturday, the Proud Boys issued a statement vowing to return to Portland every month until Wheeler “takes charge and removes the scourge of violent domestic terrorists from his city,” referring to Antifa.

Wheeler responded Saturday night by imploring Biggs to think about the millions of dollars in taxpayer money used to police and provide security for demonstrations. The mayor also said that Biggs' rhetoric was stoking an ""environment of fear nationally.""

""We do not want him here in my city. Period,"" Wheeler said.

Wheeler's message was similar to his warning to protesters on both sides prior to the demonstrations.

""We don't want your hatred, we don't want your violence, but if you come here, we're going to be prepared,"" he said in an interview on Fox News' ""Outnumbered Overtime"" on Friday.

""Again, when it comes to enforcement of our community standards, we support people's rights to demonstrate, but we don't care about who you are or your politics are,"" he said. ""If you engage in violence in this city, you will be held accountable.""

Now Both Republicans and Democrats Want To Take It Away.,2019-07-29,"Elizabeth Nolan Brown, David Post, Josh Blackman, Shikha Dalmia, Jacob Sullum, Eric Boehm, Ilya Somin, Mike Riggs","Imagine , for a moment , the following series of online exchanges . This is n't a real conversation . But it 's the sort of chaotic , revealing , and messy back and forth that could spread across the internet on any given day in 2019 :
A nonprofit immigrant rights group creates and publishes a Facebook invite for an upcoming event : a rally calling on city cops to stop carrying out sex stings at immigrant-owned massage businesses . An LGBTQ activist shares the invite link on Twitter , adding a note about how transgender and undocumented immigrant sex workers both face especially high rates of abuse .
The activist is retweeted by a number of people . Some of them add additional comments , many of them supportive . Someone is spamming their mentions with rude memes , but the activist does n't see it because that jerk has already been muted . When a friend points out the new replies , this is upgraded to a block .
A parenting and religion blogger using the handle @ ChristianMama96 shares a link to a blog post titled `` Biblical Views of Sex and Gender , '' which she wrote and published on her WordPress blog .
In the comments of Christian Momma 's blog post—hosted with a Bluehost plan and a URL purchased via GoDaddy—someone who has been banned from Twitter for violating its misgendering policy is holding court about Caitlyn Jenner . A new commenter calls the first an asshole—a comment Christian Mama deletes because it violates her no-profanity policy .
Christian Mama 's blog gets some new readers from Twitter , where the guy whose comment she deleted has been tweeting at her as part of an extended riff on the religious right . ( She stays quiet and lets her fans push back , but keeps screenshots for next week 's newsletter . )
Meanwhile , the sex worker rights rally that was the focus of the initial Facebook invite is well attended and gets picked up by several media outlets , some of whom embed Instagram posts from the event and video that 's been uploaded to YouTube . The articles are indexed by search engines and get shared on social media .
In the end , none of the people , tools , nor tech companies mentioned get forced off the internet or hit with lawsuits and criminal charges .
Tomorrow , the event invite in such a scenario might be for a Black Lives Matter rally , a Libertarian Party fundraiser , a Mormon church group outing , an anti-war protest , or a pro-life march . The blogger and newsletter creator might be a podcaster , an Instagram model , a Facebook group moderator , a popular YouTuber , or an indie press website . The Twitter tribes might be arguing about the latest rape allegations against someone powerful , the drug war , Trump 's tweets , immigration , internet regulation , or whether a hot dog counts as a sandwich .
These sorts of fictitious exchanges are , probably , no one 's ideal of online speech . Like real-world conversations , they will frequently be unpredictable , uncontrollable , and frustrating . Which is to say , they are something like the way people actually communicate—online and off⁠—in a world without top-down government control of our every utterance and interaction . People talk , argue , and disagree , sometimes in florid or outrageous terms , sometimes employing flat-out insults . It can be messy and irritating , outrageous and offensive , but also illuminating and informative—the way free speech always is .
At the end of the day , a diverse array of values and causes has space to coexist , and no faction gets to dictate the terms by which the entire internet has to play . It is n't always perfectly comfortable , but online , there is room for everyone .
In the digital realm , that freedom is only possible because of a decades-old provision of the Communications Decency Act , known as Section 230 . Signed into law by President Bill Clinton , when both Democrats and Republicans were mostly worried about online indecency , it has enabled the internet to flourish as a cultural and economic force .
Widely misunderstood and widely misinterpreted , often by those with political ambitions and agendas , Section 230 is , at its core , about making the internet safe for both innovation and individual free speech . It is the internet 's First Amendment—possibly better . And it is increasingly threatened by the illiberal right and the regressive left , both of which are now arguing that Section 230 gives tech industry giants unfair legal protection while enabling political bias and offensive speech .
Ending or amending Section 230 would n't make life difficult just for Google , Facebook , Twitter , and the rest of today 's biggest online platforms . Eroding the law would seriously jeopardize free speech for everyone , particularly marginalized groups whose ideas do n't sit easily with the mainstream . It would almost certainly kill upstarts trying to compete with entrenched tech giants . And it would set dangerous precedents , with ripple effects that extend to economic and cultural areas in the U.S. and around the world .
As Sen. Ron Wyden ( D–Ore . ) , one of the provision 's initial sponsors , put it during a March 2018 debate on the Senate floor : `` In the absence of Section 230 , the internet as we know it would shrivel . ''
Section 230 is one of the few bulwarks of liberal free speech and radically open discourse in a political era increasingly hostile to both .
The Communications Decency Act ( CDA ) came into being as part of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 , and was intended to address `` obscene , lewd , lascivious , filthy , or indecent '' materials . At the time , mainstream discourse around telecom regulation was primarily concerned with rules regarding telephone companies and TV broadcasts . To the extent lawmakers considered the CDA 's effect on the internet , the focus was on curbing the then-new phenomenon of online pornography .
Under the CDA , telecommunications facilities could face criminal charges if they failed to take `` good faith , reasonable , effective , and appropriate actions '' to stop minors from seeing indecent content . The law faced a First Amendment challenge , and the U.S. Supreme Court in late 1997 struck down many of the decency provisions entirely . But an amendment introduced by Rep. Chris Cox ( R–Calif . ) and Wyden , then in the House of Representatives , survived . That amendment was what we now know as Section 230 .
After touting the unprecedented benefit of digital communication mediums , the statute notes in a preamble that `` the Internet and other interactive computer services have flourished…with a minimum of government regulation . '' The legislation states that it 's congressional policy `` to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market '' online .
The point of Section 230 was to protect the openness of online culture while also protecting kids from online smut , and protecting the web at large from being overrun by defamatory , hateful , violent , or otherwise unwanted content . Section 230 would do this by setting up a legal framework to encourage `` the development of technologies which maximize user control over what information is received '' and removing `` disincentives for the development and utilization of blocking and filtering technologies that empower parents . '' Rather than tailoring the entire internet to be suitable for children or majority sensibilities , Congress would empower companies , families , and individuals to curate their own online experiences .
Section 230 stipulates , in essence , that digital services or platforms and their users are not one and the same and thus should n't automatically be held legally liable for each other 's speech and conduct .
Which means that practically the entire suite of products we think of as the internet—search engines , social media , online publications with comments sections , Wikis , private message boards , matchmaking apps , job search sites , consumer review tools , digital marketplaces , Airbnb , cloud storage companies , podcast distributors , app stores , GIF clearinghouses , crowdsourced funding platforms , chat tools , email newsletters , online classifieds , video sharing venues , and the vast majority of what makes up our day-to-day digital experience—have benefited from the protections offered by Section 230 .
Without it , they would face extraordinary legal liability . A world without Section 230 could sink all but the biggest companies , or force them to severely curtail the speech of their users in order to avoid legal trouble .
There are two parts of Section 230 that give it power . The first specifies :
No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider .
The second part says voluntary and `` good faith '' attempts to filter out or moderate some types of user content do n't leave a company on the hook for all user content . Specifically , it protects a right to `` restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene , lewd , lascivious , filthy , excessively violent , harassing , or otherwise objectionable . ''
Without that second provision , internet companies wishing to avoid trouble would be better off making no attempts to police user content , since doing so would open them up to much greater legal liability . `` Indecent '' and `` offensive '' material—the stuff social giants at least try to filter or moderate—could proliferate even more than they already do .
Santa Clara University law professor Eric Goldman argues that Section 230 is `` better than the First Amendment , '' at least where modern communication and technology are concerned .
`` In theory , the First Amendment—the global bellwether protection for free speech—should partially or substantially backfill any reductions in Section 230 's coverage , '' Goldman wrote on his blog recently . `` In practice , the First Amendment does no such thing . ''
To be legally shielded on First Amendment grounds , offline distributors like bookstores and newsstands must be almost entirely ignorant about materials found to be illegal . A store is legally protected so long as its owners do n't know about specific offensive material in a publication , even if they know they are stocking the publication . But legal blame can shift if a court determines that owners should have known something was wrong .
And all it can take to reach that should have known threshold is an alert that something might be off . Once a distributor is alerted , by anyone , that a work is problematic or that those involved with it have a problematic history , the distributor may be legally liable for the content—possibly as liable as the work 's creator and the parties directly responsible for its very existence .
In an analog world—with limited content suppliers and limited means of distribution—this expectation may effectively balance free speech and preventing criminality . Because a bookstore can not hold infinite books , we expect bookstore owners to know what they have in stock . But that expectation does n't scale to the digital world , where users are continuously uploading content and companies receive notice about thousands ( or more ) of potentially problematic posts per day .
`` Congress passed Section 230 because the First Amendment did not adequately protect large online platforms that processed vast amounts of third-party content , '' writes Jeff Kosseff in his 2019 book on Section 230 , The 26 Words That Created the Internet .
As far back as 1997 , courts understood that Section 230 was essential to online innovation and expression . In a world without it , computer service providers `` would be faced with ceaseless choices of suppressing controversial speech [ or ] sustaining prohibitive liability , '' wrote 4th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson in his decision on Zeran v. America Online , a case involving defamatory messages posted to an AOL message board by a third party .
Some third-party content moderation calls are easy , such as when outright threats of violence or child pornography are concerned . But some—like allegations of defamation—require facts beyond what is immediately obvious . Many require context calls that are n't readily apparent across cultures or cliques .
Without Section 230 , any complaint could thus be sufficient to make a company liable for user-created content . Companies would have every incentive to simply take down content or ban any users whom others flagged . Platforms are already overly deferential to companies and parties that file copyright takedown requests , since Section 230 does not protect against intellectual property law violations . Repealing Section 230 could cause them to show the same deference to people who complain about political or cultural content they do n't like . The result would be a dramatically less permissive environment for online speech .
`` Section 230 extends the scope of protection for 'intermediaries ' more broadly than First Amendment case law alone , '' says tech lawyer and ███ contributing editor Mike Godwin in a new book of essays , The Splinters of our Discontent . And more protection for intermediaries means more free speech for all of us .
The free-speech merits of the law have n't stopped lawmakers on both sides of the aisle from attacking 230 , using varying justifications . Some claim it allows companies to be too careless in what they allow . Others claim it encourages `` politically correct '' censorship by tech-world titans .
`` If they 're not going to be neutral and fair , if they 're going to be biased , we should repeal '' Section 230 , argued Sen. Ted Cruz ( R–Texas ) last fall . Cruz has helped popularize the idea that only through increased government control over online speech can speech really be free .
No U.S. politician has been more aggressive in pushing this idea than Sen. Josh Hawley , the 39-year-old Republican from Missouri who ousted Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in the 2018 midterms . McCaskill was also prone to fits over Section 230 , but mostly as part of a tough-on-crime charade against `` online sex trafficking . '' Hawley has almost single-handedly turned tech industry `` arrogance '' generally—and Section 230 specifically—into a leading front in the culture war .
Hawley has repeatedly suggested big social media platforms should lose Section 230 protection , claiming ( incorrectly ) that there 's a legal distinction between online publishers and online platforms . According to Hawley—but not the plain text of Section 230 or the many court decisions considering it—platforms lose Section 230 protection if they do n't practice political neutrality .
`` Twitter is exempt from liability as a 'publisher ' because it is allegedly ' a forum for a true diversity of political discourse , ' '' tweeted Hawley last November , in a call for Congress to investigate the company . `` That does not appear to be accurate . ''
It 's actually Hawley 's interpretation of the law that is inaccurate . Section 230 protections are simply not conditioned on a company offering `` true diversity of political discourse '' ( whatever that means ) , or anything like it .
The Communications Decency Act does say that `` the Internet and other interactive computer services '' can be venues for a `` true diversity of political discourse , '' `` cultural development , '' and `` intellectual activity '' —but this comes in a preamble to the actual lawmaking part of Section 230 . It merely sums up congressional dreams for the web at large .
Nonetheless , Hawley 's incorrect characterization of Section 230 has been echoed by numerous Republicans , including President Donald Trump and those on the fringe right . They say digital companies are biased against conservatives and Washington must take action .
In June , Hawley did just that , introducing a bill that would require tech companies to act like he 's already been insisting they have to . Under his proposal , dubbed the `` Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act , '' web services of a certain size would have to apply to the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) every two years for Section 230 protection , which would only be granted to companies that could prove perfectly neutral moderation practices .
The bill , in other words , would put the federal government in charge of determining what constitutes political neutrality—and correct modes of expression , generally ; it would then grant government the power to punish companies that fail at this subjective ideal . Hawley 's bill would replace the imperfect-but-market-driven content moderation practices at private companies with state-backed speech police .
In talking about tech generally , Hawley makes no concession to the conscience rights of entrepreneurs , freedom of association , or personal responsibility—values Republicans have historically harped on when it comes to private enterprise . Rather , Hawley insinuates that permissible technology and business practices should be contingent on their social benefit .
In a May speech titled `` The Big Tech Threat , '' Hawley criticized not only social media content moderation but the entire business model , which he condemned as `` hijacking users ' neural circuitry to prevent rational decision making . '' He implied individuals have little free will when confronted with algorithmic wizardry , blaming Facebook for making `` our attention spans dull '' and killing social and familial bonds .
For Hawley , overhauling Section 230 is part of a larger war on `` Big Tech , '' in which Silicon Valley has been cast in the role once occupied by Hollywood , violent games and music , or `` liberal media elites . '' It 's a battle over control of culture , and Hawley wants to use the power of the federal government to advance the conservative cause . ( Hawley 's office did not respond to multiple requests for comment . )
Hawley is n't the only one . Arizona Republican Rep. Paul Gosar—also parroting Hawley 's falsehoods about the publisher/platform distinction—recently introduced his own version of an anti-Section 230 bill . In January , Rep. Louie Gohmert ( R–Texas ) proposed conditioning Section 230 protection on sites displaying user content in chronological order .
From Fox News host Tucker Carlson , who has railed that `` screens are poison , '' to Trump boosters like American Majority CEO Ned Ryun , Hawley 's anti-tech , anti-230 sentiment is gaining traction across the right . Like the social conservatives who once demonized comic books and rap music , contemporary conservatives are siding with censors—but not for the protection of any particular values . They champion regulation as leverage against companies that have made high-profile decisions to suspend or `` demonetize '' right-leaning content creators .
It 's an impulse borne of bitterness , nurtured by carefully stoked culture war outrage , and right in line with the trendy illiberalism of the MAGA-era right . Their movement has plenty to say about what they would n't allow so long as Republicans are wearing the censor hat , but these conservatives are strangely silent about how the same control would be used by a Democratic administration .
What Democrats would do with the power Republicans are seeking matters too , because Democrats have their own plans for Section 230 and just as many excuses for why it needs to be gutted : Russian influence , `` hate speech , '' sex trafficking , online pharmacies , gun violence , `` deepfake '' videos , and so on .
After Facebook declined to take down deceptively edited video of Nancy Pelosi ( D–Calif . ) , the House Speaker called Section 230 `` a gift '' to tech companies that `` could be a question mark and in jeopardy '' since they were not , in her view , `` treating it with the respect that they should . ''
Senator and presidential candidate Kamala Harris ( D–Calif . ) has been pushing for the demise of Section 230 since she was California 's attorney general . In 2013 , she signed on to a group letter asking Congress to revise or repeal the law so they could go after Backpage for its Adult ad section .
Like Hawley , Harris and bipartisan crusaders against sex-work ads offered their own misinformation about Section 230 , implying again and again that it allows websites to offer blatantly illegal goods and services—including child sex trafficking—with impunity .
Section 230 `` permits Internet and tech companies like Backpage.com to profit from the sale of children online '' and `` gives them immunity in doing so , '' wrote law professor Mary Leary in The Washington Post two years ago .
`` Backpage and its executives purposefully and unlawfully designed Backpage to be the world 's top online brothel , '' Kamala Harris claimed in 2016 . Xavier Becerra , California 's current attorney general , said in 2017 that the law lets criminals `` prey on vulnerable children and profit from sex trafficking without fully facing the consequences of their crimes . ''
But attorneys like Harris and Becerra should know that nothing in Section 230 protects web platforms from prosecution for federal crimes . When passing Section 230 , Congress explicitly exempted federal criminal law from its purview ( along with all intellectual property statutes and certain communications privacy laws ) . If Backpage executives were really guilty of child sex trafficking , the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) could have brought trafficking charges at any time .
Nor does Section 230 protect web operators who create illegal content or participate directly in illegal activities . Those operators can be prosecuted by the feds , sued in civil court , and are subject to state and local criminal laws .
Finding deep-pocketed and directly criminal websites is pretty rare , however . And state attorneys general do n't get settlement and asset forfeiture money—nor their names in the headlines—when DOJ does the prosecuting . Hence , AGs have pushed hard against Section 230 , asking Congress for its destruction once again in 2017 .
In 2018 , Congress did honor that request ( at least in part ) by passing a bipartisan and widely lauded bill—known by the shorthand FOSTA—that carved out a special exception to Section 230 where violations of sex trafficking laws are concerned . The Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act also made it a federal crime to `` operate an interactive computer service with the intent to promote or facilitate the prostitution of another person . ''
After the law passed , Craigslist shuttered its personals section almost immediately , explaining that the new law opened `` websites to criminal and civil liability when third parties ( users ) misuse online personals unlawfully . '' The risk was n't worth it . Since then , there 's been ample evidence of a FOSTA chilling effect on non-criminal speech . But the law has failed to curb forced and underage prostitution , and police , social service agents , and sex workers say that FOSTA has actually made things worse .
Proponents portrayed FOSTA as a one-time edit of Section 230 that was necessary due to the special nature of underage prostitution and the existence of companies that allow online ads for legal sex work . But this year , state attorneys general asked Congress to amend Section 230 for the alleged sake of stopping `` opioid sales , ID theft , deep fakes , election meddling , and foreign intrusion . ''
The range of reasons anti-230 crusaders now give belies the idea that this was ever really about stopping sex trafficking . And they will keep taking bites out of the apple until there 's nothing left .
Harris has since suggested that we must `` hold social media platforms accountable for the hate infiltrating their platforms . '' Sen. Mark Warner ( D–Va . ) said companies could see changes to Section 230 if they do n't address political disinformation . Senator and 2020 presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar ( D–Minn . ) said it `` would be a great idea '' to punish social media platforms for failing to detect and remove bots .
What both the right and left attacks on the provision share is a willingness to use whatever excuses resonate—saving children , stopping bias , preventing terrorism , misogyny , and religious intolerance—to ensure more centralized control of online speech . They may couch these in partisan terms that play well with their respective bases , but their aim is essentially the same . And it 's one in which only Washington , state prosecutors , and fire-chasing lawyers win .
`` There 's a lot of nonsense out there about what [ Section 230 ] is all about , '' Wyden said in a May interview with Recode . In reality , `` it 's just about the most libertarian , free speech law on the books . ''
Let 's go back to the hypothetical online arguments from the beginning . All of the characters involved benefit from Section 230 in crucial ways .
Because of Section 230 , digital platforms can permit some sex work content without fearing prosecution . Without it , any information by and about sex workers , including content essential to their health and safety , could trigger takedown alarms from skittish companies worried about running afoul of local vice laws . The same goes for content concerning noncommercial sexual and romantic relationships , as well as stigmatized legal businesses like massage .
Because of Section 230 , bloggers and other independent content creators can moderate their own comment sections as they see fit , even if that means deleting content that 's allowable elsewhere or vice versa . Big companies like Twitter can set their own moderation rules , too , as well as provide users with customizable filtering tools . Meanwhile , blogging platforms , domain name providers , and web hosting companies need n't worry that all of this puts them at risk .
Without Section 230 , all sorts of behind-the-scenes web publishing and speech dissemination tools would be in legal jeopardy . Twitter could lose the many recent lawsuits from former users challenging their respective suspensions in court . And online communities large and small could lose the right to discriminate against disruptive , prurient , or `` otherwise objectionable '' content .
Without Section 230 , companies would thus be more likely to simply delete all user-flagged content , whether the report has merit or not , or at least immediately hide reported content as a review proceeds . It 's easy to imagine massive backlogs of challenged content , much of it flagged strategically by bad actors for reasons having nothing to do with either safety or veracity . Silencing one 's opponents would be easy .
Finally , because of Section 230 , search engines need n't vet the content of every news article they provide links to ( the same goes for news aggregation apps and sites like Reddit and Wikipedia ) . And embedding or sharing someone else 's social content does n't make you legally liable for it .
Without Section 230 , finding and sharing information online would be much harder . And a retweet might legally be considered an endorsement , with the shared liability that entails .
Yet for all the protections it provides to readers , writers , academics , shitposters , entrepreneurs , activists , and amateur political pundits of every persuasion , Section 230 has somehow become a political pariah .

CORRECTION : This post previously misidentified the state Cox represented in Congress .","Imagine, for a moment, the following series of online exchanges. This isn't a real conversation. But it's the sort of chaotic, revealing, and messy back and forth that could spread across the internet on any given day in 2019:

A nonprofit immigrant rights group creates and publishes a Facebook invite for an upcoming event: a rally calling on city cops to stop carrying out sex stings at immigrant-owned massage businesses. An LGBTQ activist shares the invite link on Twitter, adding a note about how transgender and undocumented immigrant sex workers both face especially high rates of abuse.

The activist is retweeted by a number of people. Some of them add additional comments, many of them supportive. Someone is spamming their mentions with rude memes, but the activist doesn't see it because that jerk has already been muted. When a friend points out the new replies, this is upgraded to a block.

A parenting and religion blogger using the handle @ChristianMama96 shares a link to a blog post titled ""Biblical Views of Sex and Gender,"" which she wrote and published on her WordPress blog.

In the comments of Christian Momma's blog post—hosted with a Bluehost plan and a URL purchased via GoDaddy—someone who has been banned from Twitter for violating its misgendering policy is holding court about Caitlyn Jenner. A new commenter calls the first an asshole—a comment Christian Mama deletes because it violates her no-profanity policy.

Christian Mama's blog gets some new readers from Twitter, where the guy whose comment she deleted has been tweeting at her as part of an extended riff on the religious right. (She stays quiet and lets her fans push back, but keeps screenshots for next week's newsletter.)

Meanwhile, the sex worker rights rally that was the focus of the initial Facebook invite is well attended and gets picked up by several media outlets, some of whom embed Instagram posts from the event and video that's been uploaded to YouTube. The articles are indexed by search engines and get shared on social media.

In the end, none of the people, tools, nor tech companies mentioned get forced off the internet or hit with lawsuits and criminal charges.

Tomorrow, the event invite in such a scenario might be for a Black Lives Matter rally, a Libertarian Party fundraiser, a Mormon church group outing, an anti-war protest, or a pro-life march. The blogger and newsletter creator might be a podcaster, an Instagram model, a Facebook group moderator, a popular YouTuber, or an indie press website. The Twitter tribes might be arguing about the latest rape allegations against someone powerful, the drug war, Trump's tweets, immigration, internet regulation, or whether a hot dog counts as a sandwich.

These sorts of fictitious exchanges are, probably, no one's ideal of online speech. Like real-world conversations, they will frequently be unpredictable, uncontrollable, and frustrating. Which is to say, they are something like the way people actually communicate—online and off⁠—in a world without top-down government control of our every utterance and interaction. People talk, argue, and disagree, sometimes in florid or outrageous terms, sometimes employing flat-out insults. It can be messy and irritating, outrageous and offensive, but also illuminating and informative—the way free speech always is.

At the end of the day, a diverse array of values and causes has space to coexist, and no faction gets to dictate the terms by which the entire internet has to play. It isn't always perfectly comfortable, but online, there is room for everyone.

In the digital realm, that freedom is only possible because of a decades-old provision of the Communications Decency Act, known as Section 230. Signed into law by President Bill Clinton, when both Democrats and Republicans were mostly worried about online indecency, it has enabled the internet to flourish as a cultural and economic force.

Widely misunderstood and widely misinterpreted, often by those with political ambitions and agendas, Section 230 is, at its core, about making the internet safe for both innovation and individual free speech. It is the internet's First Amendment—possibly better. And it is increasingly threatened by the illiberal right and the regressive left, both of which are now arguing that Section 230 gives tech industry giants unfair legal protection while enabling political bias and offensive speech.

Ending or amending Section 230 wouldn't make life difficult just for Google, Facebook, Twitter, and the rest of today's biggest online platforms. Eroding the law would seriously jeopardize free speech for everyone, particularly marginalized groups whose ideas don't sit easily with the mainstream. It would almost certainly kill upstarts trying to compete with entrenched tech giants. And it would set dangerous precedents, with ripple effects that extend to economic and cultural areas in the U.S. and around the world.

As Sen. Ron Wyden (D–Ore.), one of the provision's initial sponsors, put it during a March 2018 debate on the Senate floor: ""In the absence of Section 230, the internet as we know it would shrivel.""

Section 230 is one of the few bulwarks of liberal free speech and radically open discourse in a political era increasingly hostile to both.

The How and Why of Section 230

The Communications Decency Act (CDA) came into being as part of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, and was intended to address ""obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent"" materials. At the time, mainstream discourse around telecom regulation was primarily concerned with rules regarding telephone companies and TV broadcasts. To the extent lawmakers considered the CDA's effect on the internet, the focus was on curbing the then-new phenomenon of online pornography.

Under the CDA, telecommunications facilities could face criminal charges if they failed to take ""good faith, reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions"" to stop minors from seeing indecent content. The law faced a First Amendment challenge, and the U.S. Supreme Court in late 1997 struck down many of the decency provisions entirely. But an amendment introduced by Rep. Chris Cox (R–Calif.) and Wyden, then in the House of Representatives, survived. That amendment was what we now know as Section 230.

After touting the unprecedented benefit of digital communication mediums, the statute notes in a preamble that ""the Internet and other interactive computer services have flourished…with a minimum of government regulation."" The legislation states that it's congressional policy ""to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market"" online.

The point of Section 230 was to protect the openness of online culture while also protecting kids from online smut, and protecting the web at large from being overrun by defamatory, hateful, violent, or otherwise unwanted content. Section 230 would do this by setting up a legal framework to encourage ""the development of technologies which maximize user control over what information is received"" and removing ""disincentives for the development and utilization of blocking and filtering technologies that empower parents."" Rather than tailoring the entire internet to be suitable for children or majority sensibilities, Congress would empower companies, families, and individuals to curate their own online experiences.

Section 230 stipulates, in essence, that digital services or platforms and their users are not one and the same and thus shouldn't automatically be held legally liable for each other's speech and conduct.

Which means that practically the entire suite of products we think of as the internet—search engines, social media, online publications with comments sections, Wikis, private message boards, matchmaking apps, job search sites, consumer review tools, digital marketplaces, Airbnb, cloud storage companies, podcast distributors, app stores, GIF clearinghouses, crowdsourced funding platforms, chat tools, email newsletters, online classifieds, video sharing venues, and the vast majority of what makes up our day-to-day digital experience—have benefited from the protections offered by Section 230.

Without it, they would face extraordinary legal liability. A world without Section 230 could sink all but the biggest companies, or force them to severely curtail the speech of their users in order to avoid legal trouble.

There are two parts of Section 230 that give it power. The first specifies:

No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.

The second part says voluntary and ""good faith"" attempts to filter out or moderate some types of user content don't leave a company on the hook for all user content. Specifically, it protects a right to ""restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable.""

Without that second provision, internet companies wishing to avoid trouble would be better off making no attempts to police user content, since doing so would open them up to much greater legal liability. ""Indecent"" and ""offensive"" material—the stuff social giants at least try to filter or moderate—could proliferate even more than they already do.

Beyond the First Amendment

Santa Clara University law professor Eric Goldman argues that Section 230 is ""better than the First Amendment,"" at least where modern communication and technology are concerned.

""In theory, the First Amendment—the global bellwether protection for free speech—should partially or substantially backfill any reductions in Section 230's coverage,"" Goldman wrote on his blog recently. ""In practice, the First Amendment does no such thing.""

To be legally shielded on First Amendment grounds, offline distributors like bookstores and newsstands must be almost entirely ignorant about materials found to be illegal. A store is legally protected so long as its owners don't know about specific offensive material in a publication, even if they know they are stocking the publication. But legal blame can shift if a court determines that owners should have known something was wrong.

And all it can take to reach that should have known threshold is an alert that something might be off. Once a distributor is alerted, by anyone, that a work is problematic or that those involved with it have a problematic history, the distributor may be legally liable for the content—possibly as liable as the work's creator and the parties directly responsible for its very existence.

In an analog world—with limited content suppliers and limited means of distribution—this expectation may effectively balance free speech and preventing criminality. Because a bookstore cannot hold infinite books, we expect bookstore owners to know what they have in stock. But that expectation doesn't scale to the digital world, where users are continuously uploading content and companies receive notice about thousands (or more) of potentially problematic posts per day.

""Congress passed Section 230 because the First Amendment did not adequately protect large online platforms that processed vast amounts of third-party content,"" writes Jeff Kosseff in his 2019 book on Section 230, The 26 Words That Created the Internet.

As far back as 1997, courts understood that Section 230 was essential to online innovation and expression. In a world without it, computer service providers ""would be faced with ceaseless choices of suppressing controversial speech [or] sustaining prohibitive liability,"" wrote 4th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson in his decision on Zeran v. America Online, a case involving defamatory messages posted to an AOL message board by a third party.

Some third-party content moderation calls are easy, such as when outright threats of violence or child pornography are concerned. But some—like allegations of defamation—require facts beyond what is immediately obvious. Many require context calls that aren't readily apparent across cultures or cliques.

Without Section 230, any complaint could thus be sufficient to make a company liable for user-created content. Companies would have every incentive to simply take down content or ban any users whom others flagged. Platforms are already overly deferential to companies and parties that file copyright takedown requests, since Section 230 does not protect against intellectual property law violations. Repealing Section 230 could cause them to show the same deference to people who complain about political or cultural content they don't like. The result would be a dramatically less permissive environment for online speech.

""Section 230 extends the scope of protection for 'intermediaries' more broadly than First Amendment case law alone,"" says tech lawyer and Reason contributing editor Mike Godwin in a new book of essays, The Splinters of our Discontent. And more protection for intermediaries means more free speech for all of us.

The Threat From the Right

The free-speech merits of the law haven't stopped lawmakers on both sides of the aisle from attacking 230, using varying justifications. Some claim it allows companies to be too careless in what they allow. Others claim it encourages ""politically correct"" censorship by tech-world titans.

""If they're not going to be neutral and fair, if they're going to be biased, we should repeal"" Section 230, argued Sen. Ted Cruz (R–Texas) last fall. Cruz has helped popularize the idea that only through increased government control over online speech can speech really be free.

No U.S. politician has been more aggressive in pushing this idea than Sen. Josh Hawley, the 39-year-old Republican from Missouri who ousted Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in the 2018 midterms. McCaskill was also prone to fits over Section 230, but mostly as part of a tough-on-crime charade against ""online sex trafficking."" Hawley has almost single-handedly turned tech industry ""arrogance"" generally—and Section 230 specifically—into a leading front in the culture war.

Hawley has repeatedly suggested big social media platforms should lose Section 230 protection, claiming (incorrectly) that there's a legal distinction between online publishers and online platforms. According to Hawley—but not the plain text of Section 230 or the many court decisions considering it—platforms lose Section 230 protection if they don't practice political neutrality.

""Twitter is exempt from liability as a 'publisher' because it is allegedly 'a forum for a true diversity of political discourse,'"" tweeted Hawley last November, in a call for Congress to investigate the company. ""That does not appear to be accurate.""

It's actually Hawley's interpretation of the law that is inaccurate. Section 230 protections are simply not conditioned on a company offering ""true diversity of political discourse"" (whatever that means), or anything like it.

The Communications Decency Act does say that ""the Internet and other interactive computer services"" can be venues for a ""true diversity of political discourse,"" ""cultural development,"" and ""intellectual activity""—but this comes in a preamble to the actual lawmaking part of Section 230. It merely sums up congressional dreams for the web at large.

Nonetheless, Hawley's incorrect characterization of Section 230 has been echoed by numerous Republicans, including President Donald Trump and those on the fringe right. They say digital companies are biased against conservatives and Washington must take action.

In June, Hawley did just that, introducing a bill that would require tech companies to act like he's already been insisting they have to. Under his proposal, dubbed the ""Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act,"" web services of a certain size would have to apply to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) every two years for Section 230 protection, which would only be granted to companies that could prove perfectly neutral moderation practices.

The bill, in other words, would put the federal government in charge of determining what constitutes political neutrality—and correct modes of expression, generally; it would then grant government the power to punish companies that fail at this subjective ideal. Hawley's bill would replace the imperfect-but-market-driven content moderation practices at private companies with state-backed speech police.

In talking about tech generally, Hawley makes no concession to the conscience rights of entrepreneurs, freedom of association, or personal responsibility—values Republicans have historically harped on when it comes to private enterprise. Rather, Hawley insinuates that permissible technology and business practices should be contingent on their social benefit.

In a May speech titled ""The Big Tech Threat,"" Hawley criticized not only social media content moderation but the entire business model, which he condemned as ""hijacking users' neural circuitry to prevent rational decision making."" He implied individuals have little free will when confronted with algorithmic wizardry, blaming Facebook for making ""our attention spans dull"" and killing social and familial bonds.

For Hawley, overhauling Section 230 is part of a larger war on ""Big Tech,"" in which Silicon Valley has been cast in the role once occupied by Hollywood, violent games and music, or ""liberal media elites."" It's a battle over control of culture, and Hawley wants to use the power of the federal government to advance the conservative cause. (Hawley's office did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)

Hawley isn't the only one. Arizona Republican Rep. Paul Gosar—also parroting Hawley's falsehoods about the publisher/platform distinction—recently introduced his own version of an anti-Section 230 bill. In January, Rep. Louie Gohmert (R–Texas) proposed conditioning Section 230 protection on sites displaying user content in chronological order.

From Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who has railed that ""screens are poison,"" to Trump boosters like American Majority CEO Ned Ryun, Hawley's anti-tech, anti-230 sentiment is gaining traction across the right. Like the social conservatives who once demonized comic books and rap music, contemporary conservatives are siding with censors—but not for the protection of any particular values. They champion regulation as leverage against companies that have made high-profile decisions to suspend or ""demonetize"" right-leaning content creators.

It's an impulse borne of bitterness, nurtured by carefully stoked culture war outrage, and right in line with the trendy illiberalism of the MAGA-era right. Their movement has plenty to say about what they wouldn't allow so long as Republicans are wearing the censor hat, but these conservatives are strangely silent about how the same control would be used by a Democratic administration.

The Threat From the Left

What Democrats would do with the power Republicans are seeking matters too, because Democrats have their own plans for Section 230 and just as many excuses for why it needs to be gutted: Russian influence, ""hate speech,"" sex trafficking, online pharmacies, gun violence, ""deepfake"" videos, and so on.

After Facebook declined to take down deceptively edited video of Nancy Pelosi (D–Calif.), the House Speaker called Section 230 ""a gift"" to tech companies that ""could be a question mark and in jeopardy"" since they were not, in her view, ""treating it with the respect that they should.""

Senator and presidential candidate Kamala Harris (D–Calif.) has been pushing for the demise of Section 230 since she was California's attorney general. In 2013, she signed on to a group letter asking Congress to revise or repeal the law so they could go after Backpage for its Adult ad section.

Like Hawley, Harris and bipartisan crusaders against sex-work ads offered their own misinformation about Section 230, implying again and again that it allows websites to offer blatantly illegal goods and services—including child sex trafficking—with impunity.

Section 230 ""permits Internet and tech companies like Backpage.com to profit from the sale of children online"" and ""gives them immunity in doing so,"" wrote law professor Mary Leary in The Washington Post two years ago.

""Backpage and its executives purposefully and unlawfully designed Backpage to be the world's top online brothel,"" Kamala Harris claimed in 2016. Xavier Becerra, California's current attorney general, said in 2017 that the law lets criminals ""prey on vulnerable children and profit from sex trafficking without fully facing the consequences of their crimes.""

But attorneys like Harris and Becerra should know that nothing in Section 230 protects web platforms from prosecution for federal crimes. When passing Section 230, Congress explicitly exempted federal criminal law from its purview (along with all intellectual property statutes and certain communications privacy laws). If Backpage executives were really guilty of child sex trafficking, the Department of Justice (DOJ) could have brought trafficking charges at any time.

Nor does Section 230 protect web operators who create illegal content or participate directly in illegal activities. Those operators can be prosecuted by the feds, sued in civil court, and are subject to state and local criminal laws.

Finding deep-pocketed and directly criminal websites is pretty rare, however. And state attorneys general don't get settlement and asset forfeiture money—nor their names in the headlines—when DOJ does the prosecuting. Hence, AGs have pushed hard against Section 230, asking Congress for its destruction once again in 2017.

In 2018, Congress did honor that request (at least in part) by passing a bipartisan and widely lauded bill—known by the shorthand FOSTA—that carved out a special exception to Section 230 where violations of sex trafficking laws are concerned. The Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act also made it a federal crime to ""operate an interactive computer service with the intent to promote or facilitate the prostitution of another person.""

After the law passed, Craigslist shuttered its personals section almost immediately, explaining that the new law opened ""websites to criminal and civil liability when third parties (users) misuse online personals unlawfully."" The risk wasn't worth it. Since then, there's been ample evidence of a FOSTA chilling effect on non-criminal speech. But the law has failed to curb forced and underage prostitution, and police, social service agents, and sex workers say that FOSTA has actually made things worse.

Proponents portrayed FOSTA as a one-time edit of Section 230 that was necessary due to the special nature of underage prostitution and the existence of companies that allow online ads for legal sex work. But this year, state attorneys general asked Congress to amend Section 230 for the alleged sake of stopping ""opioid sales, ID theft, deep fakes, election meddling, and foreign intrusion.""

The range of reasons anti-230 crusaders now give belies the idea that this was ever really about stopping sex trafficking. And they will keep taking bites out of the apple until there's nothing left.

Harris has since suggested that we must ""hold social media platforms accountable for the hate infiltrating their platforms."" Sen. Mark Warner (D–Va.) said companies could see changes to Section 230 if they don't address political disinformation. Senator and 2020 presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar (D–Minn.) said it ""would be a great idea"" to punish social media platforms for failing to detect and remove bots.

What both the right and left attacks on the provision share is a willingness to use whatever excuses resonate—saving children, stopping bias, preventing terrorism, misogyny, and religious intolerance—to ensure more centralized control of online speech. They may couch these in partisan terms that play well with their respective bases, but their aim is essentially the same. And it's one in which only Washington, state prosecutors, and fire-chasing lawyers win.

""There's a lot of nonsense out there about what [Section 230] is all about,"" Wyden said in a May interview with Recode. In reality, ""it's just about the most libertarian, free speech law on the books.""

Is it any wonder most politicians hate it?

How 230 Makes Online Argument Possible

Let's go back to the hypothetical online arguments from the beginning. All of the characters involved benefit from Section 230 in crucial ways.

Because of Section 230, digital platforms can permit some sex work content without fearing prosecution. Without it, any information by and about sex workers, including content essential to their health and safety, could trigger takedown alarms from skittish companies worried about running afoul of local vice laws. The same goes for content concerning noncommercial sexual and romantic relationships, as well as stigmatized legal businesses like massage.

Because of Section 230, bloggers and other independent content creators can moderate their own comment sections as they see fit, even if that means deleting content that's allowable elsewhere or vice versa. Big companies like Twitter can set their own moderation rules, too, as well as provide users with customizable filtering tools. Meanwhile, blogging platforms, domain name providers, and web hosting companies needn't worry that all of this puts them at risk.

Without Section 230, all sorts of behind-the-scenes web publishing and speech dissemination tools would be in legal jeopardy. Twitter could lose the many recent lawsuits from former users challenging their respective suspensions in court. And online communities large and small could lose the right to discriminate against disruptive, prurient, or ""otherwise objectionable"" content.

Without Section 230, companies would thus be more likely to simply delete all user-flagged content, whether the report has merit or not, or at least immediately hide reported content as a review proceeds. It's easy to imagine massive backlogs of challenged content, much of it flagged strategically by bad actors for reasons having nothing to do with either safety or veracity. Silencing one's opponents would be easy.

Finally, because of Section 230, search engines needn't vet the content of every news article they provide links to (the same goes for news aggregation apps and sites like Reddit and Wikipedia). And embedding or sharing someone else's social content doesn't make you legally liable for it.

Without Section 230, finding and sharing information online would be much harder. And a retweet might legally be considered an endorsement, with the shared liability that entails.

Yet for all the protections it provides to readers, writers, academics, shitposters, entrepreneurs, activists, and amateur political pundits of every persuasion, Section 230 has somehow become a political pariah. While antitrust actions, data protection laws, and other regulatory schemes have gained some momentum, abrogating Section 230 is now a central front in the digital culture war.

With both major parties having been thrown into identity crises in the Trump era, it's not surprising they would somehow converge on a pseudo-populist crusade against Big Tech. The political class now wants everyone to believe that the way the U.S. has policed the internet for the past quarter-century—the way that's let so many of the world's biggest internet companies be founded and flourish here, midwifed the birth of participatory media we know today, helped sustain and make visible protest movements from Tunisia to Ferguson, and shined a light on legalized brutality around the world—has actually been lax, immoral, and dangerous. They want us to believe that America's political problems are Facebook's fault rather than their own.

Don't believe them. The future of free speech—and a lot more—may depend on preserving Section 230.

free_speech,Vox,0,https://www.vox.com/2017/8/20/16167870/aclu-hate-speech-nazis-charlottesville,Why the ACLU is adjusting its approach to “free speech” after Charlottesville,2017-08-20,"Dara Lind, Li Zhou, Aja Romano, Anna North, Dylan Matthews, Ian Millhiser, Sean Collins","It was a not-uncommon sentiment in the wake of last week ’ s Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville , in which 32-year-old Heather Heyer was killed ( allegedly at the hands of white supremacist James Alex Fields Jr. ) and far-right activists assaulted and intimidated counterprotesters .
The ACLU had sued the city of Charlottesville to allow the Unite the Right rally to happen downtown . And now , it had happened , and blood had been spilled .
The ACLU ’ s been through this cycle before . When the ACLU famously defended the rights of a Nazi group to march through a largely Jewish neighborhood in Skokie , Illinois , in the 1970s — a case that ’ s set the parameters of First Amendment protections for protests for the last 50 years — it lost thousands of members and faced bitter questions from liberal American Jews about how it could defend the group that had killed their relatives ( and in some cases tortured them ) just a few decades before .
But these aren ’ t the same Nazis who marched through Skokie , and this isn ’ t the same progressive movement — and it isn ’ t the same ACLU , either . The backlash has already spurred other ACLU chapters to declare that they don ’ t believe free-speech protections apply to events like the one in Charlottesville , and led the ACLU ’ s national director , Anthony Romero , to declare the group will no longer defend the right to protest when the protesters want to carry guns .
The ACLU ’ s response didn ’ t resolve the underlying problem . It didn ’ t fully address a criticism put forward everywhere from Twitter to the New York Times , which published a column from former ACLU volunteer K-Sue Park on Thursday called “ The ACLU Needs to Rethink Free Speech . ”
And with city governments already moving to restrict future far-right rallies to prevent a recurrence of what happened in Charlottesville — the city of Berkeley just passed an emergency ordinance allowing the police to dissolve gatherings that don ’ t have permits , for example , in anticipation of a forthcoming “ alt-right ” rally there — the ACLU is going to have to make some very quick decisions about when and how it will defend the far right in 2017 .
The ACLU seemed like it was in the midst of a partial reinvention as an explicitly progressive organization for the Donald Trump era . It was one of the biggest beneficiaries from the # resistance groundswell of small donations and grassroots interest after the 2016 election , and it ’ s leaned into the idea of itself as a movement organization rather than just the country ’ s most powerful public-interest law firm .
But the Charlottesville rally called attention to an important fault line between the ACLU ’ s traditional vision of justice and the way the progressive grassroots movement sees justice in 2017 : a fight over whether the best way to protect the powerless is to stand against the principles that could be used to crush them , or simply to stand on the side of people seeking social equality by whatever means are necessary .
The ACLU ’ s new line post-Charlottesville : firearms and free speech don ’ t mix
In the days before the Unite the Right rally , it became clear that Charlottesville would be a gathering point for both right-wing rallygoers and left-wing counterprotesters . The city of Charlottesville attempted to defuse the situation by moving the Unite the Right rally away from its original location — Lee Square , in downtown Charlottesville , featuring the statue of Robert E. Lee that was the ostensible cause of the rally — to a location farther away from the center of the city .
The city argued it was trying to prevent confrontation . But to free-speech activists — including the ACLU of Virginia — it was a pretty standard attempt to use a rally permit to marginalize unpopular speech . So the organizers of the rally sued , with the ACLU ’ s support , and won the right to keep the rally downtown .
You know what happened next . The Unite the Right rally was disbanded before it had officially begun , after the hours before the rally were marked by clashes between rallygoers and counterprotesters . The bulk of the violence was initiated by rallygoers , and as counterprotesters marched down a street hours after the rally , a car ( allegedly driven by Fields , who had attended the rally carrying a shield with the logo of white-supremacist group Vanguard America ) killed Heyer and injured 19 other counterprotesters .
Almost immediately , some progressives began to ask why the ACLU had fought to allow this to happen . ACLU of Virginia board member Waldo Jaquith resigned , alleging on Twitter that the organization ignored signs that rally organizers were encouraging violence — and that “ what is legal is not always right . ”
What ’ s legal and what ’ s right are sometimes different . I won ’ t be a fig leaf for Nazis . — Waldo Jaquith ( @ waldojaquith ) August 13 , 2017
With more “ alt-right ” rallies planned for the weeks after Charlottesville , and mounting pressure on the ACLU to stop “ defending Nazis , ” the ACLU ’ s California affiliates issued a statement on Wednesday declaring , “ We review each request for help on a case-by-case basis , but take the clear position that the First Amendment does not protect people who incite or engage in violence . If white supremacists march into our towns armed to the teeth and with the intent to harm people , they are not engaging in activity protected by the United States Constitution . ”
At first , it seemed like the California affiliates were subtweeting , or even splitting with , their Virginia counterpart . But on Thursday , the national organization appeared to side with the Californians — and draw a new line that would have prevented them from defending Unite the Right . ACLU director Anthony Romero told the Wall Street Journal : “ If a protest group insists , ‘ No , we want to be able to carry loaded firearms , ’ well , we don ’ t have to represent them . They can find someone else . ”
The ACLU ’ s apparent shift of position angered some of the civil-libertarians who ’ d been defending it most forcefully early in the week . “ Until now , ” lawyer and blogger Scott Greenfield wrote , the ACLU has “ never quite come out and announced that they will refuse to defend a constitutional right . This announcement says that when someone seeks to exercise two rights at the same time , the ACLU is outta there . ”
At the same time , though , it ’ s not clear that Romero ’ s statement is enough to appease the progressives who believe that the ACLU has blood on its hands for Charlottesville . Because not only is what ’ s legal not always the same as what ’ s right ( as Waldo Jaquith said ) , but in this case , the answers to both of those questions are hotly contested .
Legally , the relationship between the 1st and 2nd Amendments is complicated — and the ACLU stepped in it
In practice , freedom of speech isn ’ t exactly absolute : “ Government may not censor speech because of its viewpoint , ” says former ACLU director Nadine Strossen , “ but it may censor speech because of its effects . ”
To be specific , government can prevent speech in the case of an “ emergency ” — when it ’ s clear that there ’ s no other way to prevent or protect against violence . But for more than a century , the courts have wrestled with what responsibility someone has when their speech results in violence — and when it ’ s okay to outlaw the former to prevent the latter .
One speech emergency is a “ true threat ” — speech that is intended to provoke a “ reasonable fear that you are going to be attacked or harmed by the person engaging in the expression. ” Another ( the one that the ACLU ’ s California affiliates appeared to be invoking in their statement ) is incitement : as defense lawyer and blogger Ken White puts it , “ Is it intended to , and likely to , cause imminent lawless action ? ”
The “ imminent ” is important . “ Speech about why it ’ s morally appropriate to do lawless things is not incitement , ” White says .
An earlier legal standard held that the government could prohibit speech that had a “ bad tendency ” to result in lawless action down the road — a standard that was used to censor Communists and antiwar protesters , among other groups . But in 1969 , the Supreme Court ruled that the state of Ohio couldn ’ t prosecute speakers at a KKK rally simply for advocating for “ reveangeance ” against “ n * * * * * rs ” and “ Jews. ” The reason , as Strossen puts it : “ They were having a rally just for themselves . There was nobody else there , and nobody could see it , ” so there wasn ’ t an imminent danger . ( The KKK , in that case , was represented by the ACLU . )
But as that case makes clear , incitement isn ’ t just about what someone says but the context in which they say it . The same is true for “ true threats ” — the question is what about the context in which the speech is offered makes it clear that it ’ s reasonable for someone to feel afraid of harm .
And in the 21st century , the context in which this sort of speech is being delivered as part of a public protest is different for one big reason : guns .
“ The cases acknowledging an individual right to bear arms are very recent , ” White points out . After decades of maintaining that the Second Amendment applies to groups of people ( a “ well-organized militia ” ) instead of individuals seeking to own and carry guns , the Supreme Court sided with the “ individual right ” in the 2008 case Heller v. District of Columbia . That puts it “ like 50 years behind where the First Amendment is , ” White says , in terms of case law about what that right actually means : who it refers to , when it applies , and what if any “ emergencies ” justify the government curtailing it .
In other words , when groups of people decide to rally at a location for political purposes , and many of those people decide to bring guns , they ’ re sitting at the intersection of two different rights . And , White says , “ I don ’ t think that we ’ ve really developed the law yet very well on the connection between ” them .
And there isn ’ t an obvious bright line about what kind of speech is turned into a threat or an incitement when there ’ s a gun involved .
“ I can certainly imagine if I were for example a counterdemonstrator , and I ’ m demonstrating against people who are there brandishing firearms , I think I would feel very frightened and I think that would be a reasonable fear , ” says Strossen . “ Even as I ’ m describing it , I think my imagination ’ s pretty good , because I ’ m feeling a little chill go down my body . ”
But White is adamant that “ carrying weapons isn ’ t in itself incitement , ” and that someone can ’ t argue they face “ reasonable fear ” from a demonstrator simply carrying a weapon in a place where it ’ s legal to do so . “ Combine open carry with a statement like ‘ we are coming for you , ’ and you 've got something , ” he says . “ But you still need a threat . ”
In other words , all of these cases are inevitably going to come down to the details of who said what and when — details that are hard enough to figure out in advance , when the question is whether government will allow a future event to happen , and that are certainly not easy to draw a general principle on .
Strossen interprets Romero ’ s statement of the ACLU ’ s new policy as a commitment to “ look even closer at the facts ” before deciding which cases to take on . But “ at a time when legal specificity is needed , ” says White , “ they ’ re being dangerously vague about what they think the law is . ”
He points out that the California affiliates ’ statement “ was issued in the context of imminent ( right-wing ) marches in California . Are they saying it isn ’ t constitutionally protected ? Are they saying it shouldn ’ t be ? ”
And are they saying that the real problem is the guns , or that the people holding them are white supremacists ?
The people mad at the ACLU don ’ t believe there ’ s an easy distinction between speech and violence
Without being vague enough to drive lawyers like Ken White crazy , though , the ACLU ’ s statements would have seemed totally tone-deaf and non-responsive to the controversy raging around them . Because the question that ’ s engulfed the progressive movement in the week after Charlottesville is whether the mere existence of outspoken white supremacy , in public performance , is an existential threat .
From a leftist perspective , there ’ s more to violence than physical aggression — it ’ s also violent to promote ideas that see other groups of people as less than human , marginalize them , or prevent them from speaking . Those are the people who believe that “ hate speech ” either isn ’ t protected as free speech , or that it shouldn ’ t be — because in the case of “ hate speech , ” speech and violence are the same thing .
The NYU law professor Jeremy Waldron laid out this case in a 2012 book , The Harm in Hate Speech . He argued that the message sent by “ hate speech ” was “ to negate the implicit assurance that a society offers to the members of vulnerable groups — that they are accepted ” and that they can go about their day “ with no need to face hostility , violence , discrimination or exclusion by others. ” To Waldron , that ’ s an assurance the government is obligated to provide to all people equally , and if hate speech undermines it then hate speech ought to be curtailed .
Even some progressives who don ’ t believe in outlawing “ hate speech ” in general believe that white supremacy and Naziism are inherently violent ideologies , and therefore that adhering to them is a call for violence in its own right .
Not with words -- you can ’ t fight it with words . With fists . — C.A . Punchallnazis ( @ EyePatchGuy ) August 17 , 2017
The debate isn ’ t over punching Nazis with guns , it ’ s over punching Nazis .
But the ACLU has built its reputation , for decades , on the idea that there is no ideology so dangerous it doesn ’ t deserve vigorous First Amendment protections . “ Going back to the organization ’ s founding in 1920 , ” says Strossen , “ it was defending freedom of speech for anti-civil-libertarians , everybody from fascists to communists. ” ( This is something of a whitewash of the ACLU ’ s institutional history — like a lot of other establishment liberal organizations in the 1950s , it was too afraid of McCarthyism to defend Communists and even required members to abjure Communism in an oath — but it ’ s a decent account of its impact on the current state of free-speech law . )
From the perspective of civil libertarians , those cases — and the Skokie Nazi case — prevented a dangerous slippery slope : any legal precedent that gets set restricting speech because of what it says can easily be turned against any other speech the government doesn ’ t favor . If the paradigmatic free-speech cases of 50 years ago protected racist right-wingers , the precedents they overturned had prosecuted communists , pacifists , labor unionists , and civil-rights and racial-justice advocates .
It ’ s mind-boggling to civil libertarians like Strossen and White that any progressive , in the Trump era , would be okay with the government deciding what speech is inherently hateful or violent and what isn ’ t .
Advocating for punching Nazis is your 1st Amendment right ! Though it probably would n't be if we expand the legal definition of 'incitement ' . — Trevor Timm ( @ trevortimm ) August 17 , 2017
“ If people understood that US law draws very sensible lines between punishable and protected speech , ” says Strossen , “ I think they would have a lot more confidence that current law is the way to go. ” The unspoken counterpart : if people tried to move those lines , they wouldn ’ t end up being able to control where the law ended up .
Civil libertarians see a bright line in terms of law — they have to protect a particular legal principle unconditionally , because otherwise the principle will disappear . Meanwhile , their critics see a bright line in terms of power . To many progressives , the question of who needs to be protected is much more important than the ideas being used to justify it — and they feel it ’ s simply not all that difficult to step in when a principle is being used to benefit the powerless , and step back when it ’ s used to benefit the powerful .
This won ’ t be the last time the ACLU comes under fire for whose rights it chooses to defend
In retrospect , it ’ s a little surprising that the ACLU wasn ’ t better prepared to come under fire from the left over Charlottesville ; after all , it had just survived another progressive uproar about taking on a right-wing client .
The week before the Charlottesville rally , the national ACLU and the DC and Virginia affiliates announced that they were suing the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority , which regulates the Metro subway system in DC , for rejecting ads deemed “ political . ”
The group of rejected advertisers represented by the ACLU included a women ’ s-health network that specializes in contraceptives and abortion — but it also included right-wing firebrand Milo Yiannopoulos , who ’ s managed to squeeze 15 minutes of fame out of saying inflammatory things and being protested on ( and banned from ) college campuses because of them .
Perhaps unsurprisingly , the headline became “ ACLU defends Milo. ” And several progressives were annoyed at best and outraged at worst — not because they were particularly invested in keeping Yiannopoulos ’ ads off the DC Metro , but because they didn ’ t understand why the ACLU was choosing to take him on as a client ( especially when they could have taken a lower-key approach , like filing a brief on his behalf ) .
This is the root of the progressive objection to the ACLU : not that the things it is doing are legally wrong , but that by picking battles that don ’ t always align with progressive objectives it ’ s missing the forest of justice for the trees .
“ The danger that communities face because of their speech isn ’ t equal , ” K-Sue Park wrote in her Thursday New York Times column . “ The A.C.L.U. ’ s decision to offer legal support to a right-wing cause , then a left-wing cause , won ’ t make it so . ”
It ’ s a charge that ’ s been leveled against the ACLU since Skokie and earlier . In a post-Skokie debate between the ACLU ’ s then-director and a leftist lawyer from the National Lawyers Guild , the leftist lawyer opened with : “ The law is not neutral . The courts are not neutral . The A.C.L.U . is not as neutral as it pretends . ”
But the progressive critique now , as articulated by Park , is actually that the ACLU is neutral , and reality isn ’ t . It ’ s an argument progressives also made in 2010 , when the ACLU supported the Supreme Court ’ s controversial decision in Citizens United , which struck down restrictions on campaign finance as a First Amendment violation . Park writes that power determines whose speech matters , and that a real defense of “ free speech ” would “ imagine a holistic picture of how speech rights are under attack right now ” — for everything from corporations to criminal law and voting restrictions — “ not focus on only First Amendment case law . ”
From this perspective , allowing the government to pick and choose whose speech is protected isn ’ t a slippery slope — it ’ s already happening . ( The fact that state legislatures in Tennessee and Florida considered bills in 2017 that would give immunity from civil lawsuits to drivers who ran into protesters blocking streets was used both by Ken White in arguing for “ viewpoint-neutral ” free speech protection , and by Park in her op-ed arguing against it — with both of them using the example to make the case that the current power structure is biased against left-leaning dissent . ) The difference is that it ’ s happening in ways that they allege are too subtle for the ACLU ’ s current strategy .
The ACLU rebranded itself for the resistance . And now it ’ s reaping the backlash .
What ’ s odd about Park ’ s critique is that the ACLU is involved in many , if not most , of the issues she thinks are posing a more urgent threat to free speech than attempts to restrain Nazis from marching on Lee Square . The contemporary ACLU has whole divisions dedicated to voting rights , criminal justice , and LGBTQ rights . It consistently advocates for affirmative action . It ’ s poured millions into an effort to protect immigrant rights at the state level . It has become , in many ways , enmeshed with the rest of the progressive movement .
But that ’ s also what makes Park ’ s critique , and the critique of others who agree with her , hit so close to home . Because the ACLU does look like a progressive organization right now , it ’ s particularly striking when it disagrees with the rest of the progressive movement .
This was true before the 2016 election ( it ’ s why the ACLU took so much heat for Citizens United ) . But in the wake of the election of Donald Trump , it really looked like the ACLU itself was embracing an identity as a leader of the progressive movement .
In the immediate aftermath of the election , the ACLU became a touchstone organization for progressives ( from people on Twitter to celebrities ) to broadcast their support for and call for donations to . After all , it was an umbrella organization working on a range of issues that tracked with the people most likely to be made vulnerable under a Trump administration , but the fact that it was not explicitly on the Democrats ’ “ side ” made it look like a symbol of the transpartisan decency that the country had lost by electing Trump .
By February , the organization had raised $ 79 million since the election ( from 1 million donors ) . Its membership had more than doubled . But along with that flood of support came the expectation that the ACLU actually do something with it , and become a # resistance leader .
Grassroots movement-building wasn ’ t the organization ’ s traditional strength , but it became a new focus . Visit the ACLU ’ s website today , and this is the banner you ’ ll see , above a picture of Trump and the headline “ THE FIGHT IS ON ” :
And they ’ ve used that network to mobilize on progressive economic issues beyond the organization ’ s traditional mission — during the fight over Congressional repeal of the Affordable Care Act , for example , the ACLU fought hard to resist cuts to Medicaid .
If someone didn ’ t know anything about the ACLU before the election — or if they believed , with some reason , that the group was remaking itself for the Trump era — it makes sense they ’ d be alarmed to see the ACLU defending Trump allies like Milo Yiannopoulos , or helping the white supremacists who Trump was excoriated for calling “ very fine people ” in Charlottesville . That doesn ’ t seem like resistance , it seems like helping the people trying to crush the resistance .
As far as the ACLU ’ s traditional values are concerned , resistance is what you do , not the side you ’ re on . And they ’ re used to members not agreeing with everything they ’ re working on : “ no thinking person could possibly agree with every single thing that the ACLU does , ” says Strossen .
But she hastens to add , “ I think it ’ s essential that there be at least one organization that is striving to do what our government is required to do , which is to defend all fundamental freedoms for all people regardless of the color of skin and regardless of the color of your ideology . ”
Traditionally , that principle has been immune to pressure from members . But with more members — and members with higher expectations , than ever before — it ’ s not yet clear whether the post-Charlottesville reset the ACLU ’ s attempting is a way to smooth over the difference between their vision of justice and many of their members ’ — or a step to bring themselves in line with the progressive resistance group members may want them to be .","“The ACLU has blood on its hands.”

It was a not-uncommon sentiment in the wake of last week’s Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, in which 32-year-old Heather Heyer was killed (allegedly at the hands of white supremacist James Alex Fields Jr.) and far-right activists assaulted and intimidated counterprotesters.

The ACLU had sued the city of Charlottesville to allow the Unite the Right rally to happen downtown. And now, it had happened, and blood had been spilled.

The ACLU’s been through this cycle before. When the ACLU famously defended the rights of a Nazi group to march through a largely Jewish neighborhood in Skokie, Illinois, in the 1970s — a case that’s set the parameters of First Amendment protections for protests for the last 50 years — it lost thousands of members and faced bitter questions from liberal American Jews about how it could defend the group that had killed their relatives (and in some cases tortured them) just a few decades before.

But these aren’t the same Nazis who marched through Skokie, and this isn’t the same progressive movement — and it isn’t the same ACLU, either. The backlash has already spurred other ACLU chapters to declare that they don’t believe free-speech protections apply to events like the one in Charlottesville, and led the ACLU’s national director, Anthony Romero, to declare the group will no longer defend the right to protest when the protesters want to carry guns.

The ACLU’s response didn’t resolve the underlying problem. It didn’t fully address a criticism put forward everywhere from Twitter to the New York Times, which published a column from former ACLU volunteer K-Sue Park on Thursday called “The ACLU Needs to Rethink Free Speech.”

And with city governments already moving to restrict future far-right rallies to prevent a recurrence of what happened in Charlottesville — the city of Berkeley just passed an emergency ordinance allowing the police to dissolve gatherings that don’t have permits, for example, in anticipation of a forthcoming “alt-right” rally there — the ACLU is going to have to make some very quick decisions about when and how it will defend the far right in 2017.

The ACLU seemed like it was in the midst of a partial reinvention as an explicitly progressive organization for the Donald Trump era. It was one of the biggest beneficiaries from the #resistance groundswell of small donations and grassroots interest after the 2016 election, and it’s leaned into the idea of itself as a movement organization rather than just the country’s most powerful public-interest law firm.

But the Charlottesville rally called attention to an important fault line between the ACLU’s traditional vision of justice and the way the progressive grassroots movement sees justice in 2017: a fight over whether the best way to protect the powerless is to stand against the principles that could be used to crush them, or simply to stand on the side of people seeking social equality by whatever means are necessary.

The ACLU’s new line post-Charlottesville: firearms and free speech don’t mix

In the days before the Unite the Right rally, it became clear that Charlottesville would be a gathering point for both right-wing rallygoers and left-wing counterprotesters. The city of Charlottesville attempted to defuse the situation by moving the Unite the Right rally away from its original location — Lee Square, in downtown Charlottesville, featuring the statue of Robert E. Lee that was the ostensible cause of the rally — to a location farther away from the center of the city.

The city argued it was trying to prevent confrontation. But to free-speech activists — including the ACLU of Virginia — it was a pretty standard attempt to use a rally permit to marginalize unpopular speech. So the organizers of the rally sued, with the ACLU’s support, and won the right to keep the rally downtown.

You know what happened next. The Unite the Right rally was disbanded before it had officially begun, after the hours before the rally were marked by clashes between rallygoers and counterprotesters. The bulk of the violence was initiated by rallygoers, and as counterprotesters marched down a street hours after the rally, a car (allegedly driven by Fields, who had attended the rally carrying a shield with the logo of white-supremacist group Vanguard America) killed Heyer and injured 19 other counterprotesters.

Almost immediately, some progressives began to ask why the ACLU had fought to allow this to happen. ACLU of Virginia board member Waldo Jaquith resigned, alleging on Twitter that the organization ignored signs that rally organizers were encouraging violence — and that “what is legal is not always right.”

I just resigned from the ACLU of Virginia board.



What’s legal and what’s right are sometimes different. I won’t be a fig leaf for Nazis. — Waldo Jaquith (@waldojaquith) August 13, 2017

With more “alt-right” rallies planned for the weeks after Charlottesville, and mounting pressure on the ACLU to stop “defending Nazis,” the ACLU’s California affiliates issued a statement on Wednesday declaring, “We review each request for help on a case-by-case basis, but take the clear position that the First Amendment does not protect people who incite or engage in violence. If white supremacists march into our towns armed to the teeth and with the intent to harm people, they are not engaging in activity protected by the United States Constitution.”

At first, it seemed like the California affiliates were subtweeting, or even splitting with, their Virginia counterpart. But on Thursday, the national organization appeared to side with the Californians — and draw a new line that would have prevented them from defending Unite the Right. ACLU director Anthony Romero told the Wall Street Journal: “If a protest group insists, ‘No, we want to be able to carry loaded firearms,’ well, we don’t have to represent them. They can find someone else.”

The ACLU’s apparent shift of position angered some of the civil-libertarians who’d been defending it most forcefully early in the week. “Until now,” lawyer and blogger Scott Greenfield wrote, the ACLU has “never quite come out and announced that they will refuse to defend a constitutional right. This announcement says that when someone seeks to exercise two rights at the same time, the ACLU is outta there.”

At the same time, though, it’s not clear that Romero’s statement is enough to appease the progressives who believe that the ACLU has blood on its hands for Charlottesville. Because not only is what’s legal not always the same as what’s right (as Waldo Jaquith said), but in this case, the answers to both of those questions are hotly contested.

Legally, the relationship between the 1st and 2nd Amendments is complicated — and the ACLU stepped in it

In practice, freedom of speech isn’t exactly absolute: “Government may not censor speech because of its viewpoint,” says former ACLU director Nadine Strossen, “but it may censor speech because of its effects.”

To be specific, government can prevent speech in the case of an “emergency” — when it’s clear that there’s no other way to prevent or protect against violence. But for more than a century, the courts have wrestled with what responsibility someone has when their speech results in violence — and when it’s okay to outlaw the former to prevent the latter.

One speech emergency is a “true threat” — speech that is intended to provoke a “reasonable fear that you are going to be attacked or harmed by the person engaging in the expression.” Another (the one that the ACLU’s California affiliates appeared to be invoking in their statement) is incitement: as defense lawyer and blogger Ken White puts it, “Is it intended to, and likely to, cause imminent lawless action?”

The “imminent” is important. “Speech about why it’s morally appropriate to do lawless things is not incitement,” White says.

An earlier legal standard held that the government could prohibit speech that had a “bad tendency” to result in lawless action down the road — a standard that was used to censor Communists and antiwar protesters, among other groups. But in 1969, the Supreme Court ruled that the state of Ohio couldn’t prosecute speakers at a KKK rally simply for advocating for “reveangeance” against “n*****rs” and “Jews.” The reason, as Strossen puts it: “They were having a rally just for themselves. There was nobody else there, and nobody could see it,” so there wasn’t an imminent danger. (The KKK, in that case, was represented by the ACLU.)

But as that case makes clear, incitement isn’t just about what someone says but the context in which they say it. The same is true for “true threats” — the question is what about the context in which the speech is offered makes it clear that it’s reasonable for someone to feel afraid of harm.

And in the 21st century, the context in which this sort of speech is being delivered as part of a public protest is different for one big reason: guns.

“The cases acknowledging an individual right to bear arms are very recent,” White points out. After decades of maintaining that the Second Amendment applies to groups of people (a “well-organized militia”) instead of individuals seeking to own and carry guns, the Supreme Court sided with the “individual right” in the 2008 case Heller v. District of Columbia. That puts it “like 50 years behind where the First Amendment is,” White says, in terms of case law about what that right actually means: who it refers to, when it applies, and what if any “emergencies” justify the government curtailing it.

In other words, when groups of people decide to rally at a location for political purposes, and many of those people decide to bring guns, they’re sitting at the intersection of two different rights. And, White says, “I don’t think that we’ve really developed the law yet very well on the connection between” them.

And there isn’t an obvious bright line about what kind of speech is turned into a threat or an incitement when there’s a gun involved.

“I can certainly imagine if I were for example a counterdemonstrator, and I’m demonstrating against people who are there brandishing firearms, I think I would feel very frightened and I think that would be a reasonable fear,” says Strossen. “Even as I’m describing it, I think my imagination’s pretty good, because I’m feeling a little chill go down my body.”

But White is adamant that “carrying weapons isn’t in itself incitement,” and that someone can’t argue they face “reasonable fear” from a demonstrator simply carrying a weapon in a place where it’s legal to do so. “Combine open carry with a statement like ‘we are coming for you,’ and you've got something,” he says. “But you still need a threat.”

In other words, all of these cases are inevitably going to come down to the details of who said what and when — details that are hard enough to figure out in advance, when the question is whether government will allow a future event to happen, and that are certainly not easy to draw a general principle on.

Strossen interprets Romero’s statement of the ACLU’s new policy as a commitment to “look even closer at the facts” before deciding which cases to take on. But “at a time when legal specificity is needed,” says White, “they’re being dangerously vague about what they think the law is.”

He points out that the California affiliates’ statement “was issued in the context of imminent (right-wing) marches in California. Are they saying it isn’t constitutionally protected? Are they saying it shouldn’t be?”

And are they saying that the real problem is the guns, or that the people holding them are white supremacists?

Without being vague enough to drive lawyers like Ken White crazy, though, the ACLU’s statements would have seemed totally tone-deaf and non-responsive to the controversy raging around them.

After all, it was an umbrella organization working on a range of issues that tracked with the people most likely to be made vulnerable under a Trump administration, but the fact that it was not explicitly on the Democrats’ “side” made it look like a symbol of the transpartisan decency that the country had lost by electing Trump.

By February, the organization had raised $79 million since the election (from 1 million donors). Its membership had more than doubled. But along with that flood of support came the expectation that the ACLU actually do something with it, and become a #resistance leader.

Grassroots movement-building wasn’t the organization’s traditional strength, but it became a new focus. Visit the ACLU’s website today, and this is the banner you’ll see, above a picture of Trump and the headline “THE FIGHT IS ON”:

And they’ve used that network to mobilize on progressive economic issues beyond the organization’s traditional mission — during the fight over Congressional repeal of the Affordable Care Act, for example, the ACLU fought hard to resist cuts to Medicaid.

If someone didn’t know anything about the ACLU before the election — or if they believed, with some reason, that the group was remaking itself for the Trump era — it makes sense they’d be alarmed to see the ACLU defending Trump allies like Milo Yiannopoulos, or helping the white supremacists who Trump was excoriated for calling “very fine people” in Charlottesville. That doesn’t seem like resistance, it seems like helping the people trying to crush the resistance.

As far as the ACLU’s traditional values are concerned, resistance is what you do, not the side you’re on. And they’re used to members not agreeing with everything they’re working on: “no thinking person could possibly agree with every single thing that the ACLU does,” says Strossen.

But she hastens to add, “I think it’s essential that there be at least one organization that is striving to do what our government is required to do, which is to defend all fundamental freedoms for all people regardless of the color of skin and regardless of the color of your ideology.”

Traditionally, that principle has been immune to pressure from members. But with more members — and members with higher expectations, than ever before — it’s not yet clear whether the post-Charlottesville reset the ACLU’s attempting is a way to smooth over the difference between their vision of justice and many of their members’ — or a step to bring themselves in line with the progressive resistance group members may want them to be.",www.vox.com,left,at3NfgOlmn4TXi8W

free_speech,Pacific Standard,0,https://psmag.com/social-justice/understanding-antifa,WHY THE MEDIA REFUSES TO UNDERSTAND ANTIFA,2017-08-31,Malcolm Harris,"For months , the American public has debated how best to confront the fascist right as its members attempt to build power . Now , after being chased out of Boston and then the Bay Area , America 's white-power activists seem to be on their collective back foot for the first time in over a year . How did this happen , and what can we learn about how to keep them in retreat ?
Among those on the broadly defined left , the main strategic split with regard to fascists has been between those who favor prevention by any means ( up to and including physical confrontation ) , and those who think it 's best to let the marketplace of ideas take care of their worthless ideology . Call it antifa versus free speech . A lot of people have changed their position on this in reaction to unfolding events , but the poles have remained intact . Antifa still wants to bash the fash , and free-speechers still want to tease the KKK into obscurity like Superman did . Somehow , both sides still think they 're right .
It 's important to note the antifa/free speech division does n't split evenly between liberals and the far left . There are capital-D Democrats like former congressman John Dingell , who tweeted `` I signed up to fight Nazis 73 years ago and I 'll do it again if I have to , '' and there are ex-revolutionaries like Todd Gitlin who think antifascism is `` alienating . ''
The free speech crowd certainly does know how to speak , and their central success has been publishing articles that reinforce the idea that antifa scares away allies and emboldens the right . These pundits clearly do speak for a segment of the population , and it 's possible that black bloc outfits and videos of street fighting—touted incessantly by right-wing media—are turning them away from the antifascist cause . The more alienated these observers feel , the more correct they consider themselves in condemning antifa . But antifa is n't trying to earn the support of 51 percent of any electorate . Our main concern is winning , and we do n't need nearly that many people to do it .
The chaos and brutality in Charlottesville showed what 's at stake , and what happens when antifascists are outnumbered . Fascists showed up hoping to hurt people , a posture that gave them a fighting advantage when both sides were equal in strength . Antifascists were able to protect other activists from further harm and possible death , while the struggle of Corey Long and Deandre Harris and the martyrdom of Heather Heyer inspired nationwide introspection—even if President Donald Trump thought about it and landed on the wrong answer . It 's hard to watch this footage and not conclude that standing up to white supremacists—literally just standing—requires conscious self-defense .
People were horrified by the white-nationalist show of strength in Charlottesville . But since then , fascists attempting to maintain their momentum have instead crashed into a brick wall . In Boston and San Francisco , thousands of antifascists flooded the streets to shut them down , leading to a reversal of the infamous torch march pictures : a few dozen white supremacists , surrounded by the outraged citizenry . Compared to Charlottesville , the violence was minimal , and that 's how it 's supposed to work . When antifa wins , there 's little fighting , and participants move on to other things , like disaster relief ; when the fascists win , there are death camps .
Luckily , the free speech side is right about one thing : Fascists are not a dominant force in American politics , their West Wing access notwithstanding . If we want to make them feel deeply unwelcome and vastly outnumbered , antifascists do n't need everyone to the left of the KKK to show up ready to throw down . A 10- or 20-to-one anti-to-fa ratio is sufficient , which means we 're talking about minor-league baseball attendance numbers here , tops . And I do n't mean a 10,000-person black bloc : a small militant core can protect a broad diversity of antifascists . That 's what Mother Jones reporter Shane Bauer saw in Berkeley : `` Many attendees expressed surprise at the unprecedented level of coordination between groups that do n't always get along , '' he wrote .
That visibility means Donald Trump and Fox News now love to cite the menace of antifa , but as ideologically and venally motivated liars , they will always find their bogeymen on the left—whether that 's college professors , the ( irrelevant ) New Black Panthers , or a pizza parlor in Washington , D.C . Worrying about whether we 're giving them material for their lies is a fool 's neuroticism . They 're going to make up fake news anyway—turning a fascist who lost a fight into an innocent bystander or lending credence to the guy who stabbed himself and blamed antifa . The truth is that most pundits ( on the right and supposed left ) are happy to fall for these `` vicious antifa '' stories because these pundits are more concerned with order than justice . For them , people fighting in the street over politics will always conjure images of other countries where they do n't want to live . It upsets them .
That 's not a serious analysis of the situation on the ground ; it 's a visceral , emotional reaction—the same one that inevitably arises against every group or movement that upsets the order of things . The pundits are card-carrying members of the order of things , and they are upset . But they have not and will not stop the people who are refusing to hand their communities over to fascists , not for a day , not for an hour , not for a minute .
There is no such thing as a non-violent fascist march . Maybe some people feel safe with bands of armed Nazis roaming their streets , but I certainly do n't . The key to preventing violence is n't ceding public space to the torch-bearers because they 're willing to hurt people , it 's making sure they have no room at all . The proof is in the pudding : After being overwhelmed in Boston , the alt-right canceled a 67-rally day of action scheduled for September 9th . If masses of people had n't showed up to confront them in Boston and the Bay , we do n't know the kind of violence and brutality we would be preparing for . It 's a victory for peace that we wo n't have to find out .
For all the self-righteous talk on the free speech side , the antifa ranks are swelling . While the pundits and right-wing politicians spin themselves into a tizzy over black masks , antifascists are winning credibility , building alliances , and earning the admiration of everyday people . Clergy members at Charlottesville—some of them strictly committed to non-violence—credited antifa with saving their lives . A Lutheran parish administrator named Logan Rimel summed up his experience : `` White Christians , if you are n't willing to personally take a bat to the head , shut up about antifa . ''
University of Virginia professor Siva Vaidhyanathan regretted his decision not to stand with antifa during the Charlottesville chaos : `` A young man named Dre Harris was ambushed in a parking lot and took dozens of blows by club-wielding thugs . He took them so I would n't have to , '' Vaidhyanathan wrote . `` Next time I will stand on the street with my neighbors , even at the risk of injury or death . '' The needle is moving , and open-minded people in good faith have begun to recognize antifa for the defensive formation that it is .
I 'm sure the people who want to let the Nazis fizzle out on their own have good intentions . I do n't believe my argument , or any argument , will change their minds . And I 'm sure they wo n't have any trouble finding microphones to amplify their concerns . But even if the antifascist ranks never grow beyond groups like Black Lives Matter , progressive communities of faith , and people to the left of Bernie Sanders , that will be more than enough to win . If winning this fight means those groups can build trust , solidarity , and interdependence , they can set themselves up to do a lot more than that—and it will be the fascists who are sorry they ever showed up .","Antifa members gather to protest the right-wing No to Marxism rally in Berkeley, California, on August 27th, 2017.

Now, after being chased out of Boston and then the Bay Area, America's white-power activists seem to be on their collective back foot for the first time in over a year. How did this happen, and what can we learn about how to keep them in retreat?

There are capital-D Democrats like former congressman John Dingell, who tweeted ""I signed up to fight Nazis 73 years ago and I'll do it again if I have to,"" and there are ex-revolutionaries like Todd Gitlin who think antifascism is ""alienating.""

The free speech crowd certainly does know how to speak, and their central success has been publishing articles that reinforce the idea that antifa scares away allies and emboldens the right. These pundits clearly do speak for a segment of the population, and it's possible that black bloc outfits and videos of street fighting—touted incessantly by right-wing media—are turning them away from the antifascist cause. The more alienated these observers feel, the more correct they consider themselves in condemning antifa. But antifa isn't trying to earn the support of 51 percent of any electorate. Our main concern is winning, and we don't need nearly that many people to do it.

The chaos and brutality in Charlottesville showed what's at stake, and what happens when antifascists are outnumbered. Fascists showed up hoping to hurt people, a posture that gave them a fighting advantage when both sides were equal in strength. Antifascists were able to protect other activists from further harm and possible death, while the struggle of Corey Long and Deandre Harris and the martyrdom of Heather Heyer inspired nationwide introspection—even if President Donald Trump thought about it and landed on the wrong answer. It's hard to watch this footage and not conclude that standing up to white supremacists—literally just standing—requires conscious self-defense.

People were horrified by the white-nationalist show of strength in Charlottesville. But since then, fascists attempting to maintain their momentum have instead crashed into a brick wall. In Boston and San Francisco, thousands of antifascists flooded the streets to shut them down, leading to a reversal of the infamous torch march pictures: a few dozen white supremacists, surrounded by the outraged citizenry. Compared to Charlottesville, the violence was minimal, and that's how it's supposed to work. When antifa wins, there's little fighting, and participants move on to other things, like disaster relief; when the fascists win, there are death camps.

Luckily, the free speech side is right about one thing: Fascists are not a dominant force in American politics, their West Wing access notwithstanding. If we want to make them feel deeply unwelcome and vastly outnumbered, antifascists don't need everyone to the left of the KKK to show up ready to throw down. A 10- or 20-to-one anti-to-fa ratio is sufficient, which means we're talking about minor-league baseball attendance numbers here, tops. And I don't mean a 10,000-person black bloc: a small militant core can protect a broad diversity of antifascists. That's what Mother Jones reporter Shane Bauer saw in Berkeley: ""Many attendees expressed surprise at the unprecedented level of coordination between groups that don't always get along,"" he wrote.

That visibility means Donald Trump and Fox News now love to cite the menace of antifa, but as ideologically and venally motivated liars, they will always find their bogeymen on the left—whether that's college professors, the (irrelevant) New Black Panthers, or a pizza parlor in Washington, D.C. Worrying about whether we're giving them material for their lies is a fool's neuroticism. They're going to make up fake news anyway—turning a fascist who lost a fight into an innocent bystander or lending credence to the guy who stabbed himself and blamed antifa. The truth is that most pundits (on the right and supposed left) are happy to fall for these ""vicious antifa"" stories because these pundits are more concerned with order than justice. For them, people fighting in the street over politics will always conjure images of other countries where they don't want to live. It upsets them.

That's not a serious analysis of the situation on the ground; it's a visceral, emotional reaction—the same one that inevitably arises against every group or movement that upsets the order of things. The pundits are card-carrying members of the order of things, and they are upset. But they have not and will not stop the people who are refusing to hand their communities over to fascists, not for a day, not for an hour, not for a minute.

Hundreds of people dressed in black converge on Berkeley, California, on August 27th, 2017. The park became a center of left-wing protest when hundreds of people opposed to President Donald Trump and hundreds more aligned with antifa descended on it after a planned right-wing rally was canceled.

There is no such thing as a non-violent fascist march. Maybe some people feel safe with bands of armed Nazis roaming their streets, but I certainly don't. The key to preventing violence isn't ceding public space to the torch-bearers because they're willing to hurt people, it's making sure they have no room at all. The proof is in the pudding: After being overwhelmed in Boston, the alt-right canceled a 67-rally day of action scheduled for September 9th. If masses of people hadn't showed up to confront them in Boston and the Bay, we don't know the kind of violence and brutality we would be preparing for. It's a victory for peace that we won't have to find out.

For all the self-righteous talk on the free speech side, the antifa ranks are swelling. While the pundits and right-wing politicians spin themselves into a tizzy over black masks, antifascists are winning credibility, building alliances, and earning the admiration of everyday people. Clergy members at Charlottesville—some of them strictly committed to non-violence—credited antifa with saving their lives. A Lutheran parish administrator named Logan Rimel summed up his experience: ""White Christians, if you aren't willing to personally take a bat to the head, shut up about antifa.""

University of Virginia professor Siva Vaidhyanathan regretted his decision not to stand with antifa during the Charlottesville chaos: ""A young man named Dre Harris was ambushed in a parking lot and took dozens of blows by club-wielding thugs. He took them so I wouldn't have to,"" Vaidhyanathan wrote. ""Next time I will stand on the street with my neighbors, even at the risk of injury or death."" The needle is moving, and open-minded people in good faith have begun to recognize antifa for the defensive formation that it is.

I'm sure the people who want to let the Nazis fizzle out on their own have good intentions. I don't believe my argument, or any argument, will change their minds. And I'm sure they won't have any trouble finding microphones to amplify their concerns. But even if the antifascist ranks never grow beyond groups like Black Lives Matter, progressive communities of faith, and people to the left of Bernie Sanders, that will be more than enough to win. If winning this fight means those groups can build trust, solidarity, and interdependence, they can set themselves up to do a lot more than that—and it will be the fascists who are sorry they ever showed up.",www.psmag.com,left,HDVorAmm6VlPesVy

'' Although Cole 's op-ed piece is explicitly directed at `` liberals or progressives , '' it can also be read as an oblique rejoinder to libertarians and conservatives who worry that the ACLU itself has lost faith in the First Amendment .
That concern is not new . Back in 1990 , ███ published a cover story in which Charles Oliver argued that the ACLU 's commitment to freedom of speech had been compromised by its pursuit of progressive causes . `` In recent years , '' he wrote , `` the ACLU has adopted an expansive definition of 'civil liberties ' that dilutes its absolutist commitment to free speech . The ACLU , critics say , is now more committed to goals such as comparable worth , government aid to the homeless , and nuclear disarmament than to defending the First Amendment . '' Oliver noted that critics , including longtime ACLU members such as Nat Hentoff and Alan Dershowitz , were complaining that `` greed and left-wing ideology have corrupted the union , '' which had `` diluted its message , compromised its mission , and , in some instances , abandoned its commitment to the First Amendment . ''
Nearly three decades later , the argument about the ACLU 's support for freedom of speech continues , which tells us two things : The organization is still divided on the question , and the stalwarts are influential enough that the ACLU is still willing to defend the First Amendment rights of people who offend progressives .
As Robby Soave noted in June , the latest evidence of internal qualms about free speech is a staff memo revealed by Wendy Kaminer , a former member of the ACLU 's national board , that says the organization 's lawyers , in selecting First Amendment cases , should consider the impact of speech on `` other values advanced by the ACLU , '' such as equality and racial justice . While the memo repeatedly affirms the ACLU 's commitment to defending speakers whose views its members find repugnant , the very idea that the organization 's goals conflict with each other is an inivitation to prioritize some of those `` other values '' over freedom of speech . `` In deciding how to use our limited resources , '' the memo says , `` no civil liberties or civil rights value should automatically be privileged over any other . There is no presumption that the First Amendment trumps all other amendments , or vice versa . ''
The assumption that the `` rights '' defended by the ACLU inevitably conflict with each other is not only troubling but incoherent , since the whole point of rights is to avoid conflict by delineating each person 's legally enforceable claims . If one person has a right to spout racist bile , it can not be true that another person has a right to silence him . Yet the memo implies that freedom of speech conflicts with other rights . `` Speech that denigrates [ marginalized ] groups can inflict serious harms , '' it says , `` and is intended to and often will impede progress toward equality . '' It is not hard to see why such loose , compromise-inviting talk bothers critics like Kaminer and former ACLU Executive Director Ira Glasser .
Cole 's response to Kaminer reaffirmed `` our commitment to defending speech with which we disagree , '' but it also repeated the memo 's thesis that First Amendment cases can `` pose conflicts between our values . '' In his New York Times piece , Cole argues that the ACLU still takes a viewpoint-neutral approach to First Amendment cases :
In just the last year or so , my organization…has invoked the First Amendment to defend high school students disciplined for walking out from school to call for gun control , as well as other students penalized for posting pictures of guns on social media ; a student newspaper denied funding after publishing a satire of `` safe spaces , '' as well as fans of a hip-hop band labeled gang members ; Milo Yiannopoulos and the animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals , both of whom were denied permission to advertise on the subway by the Washington Metro Authority ; and anti-Trump as well as pro-Trump demonstrators . We 've defended flag desecraters , union organizers , and citizens blocked from their representatives ' Facebook sites for their criticism .
Cole wants progressives to understand the value of this approach , which defends a principle that is useful to the left as well as the right . `` When the Roberts court ruled that the First Amendment prohibited holding the Westboro Baptist Church liable for displaying anti-gay signs outside a military funeral , '' he writes , `` its rationale would equally protect Revolutionary Communist Party demonstrators holding anti-Christian signs outside the Westboro Baptist Church . ''
Cole rebuts the idea that neutrality is suspect because it favors the rich and powerful . Actually , he says , `` the First Amendment favors people without power and influence . In a democracy , the rich and those in the majority do n't need constitutional protections ; they can generally enact their desires through ordinary political processes . The targets of censorship are typically dissidents , outsiders , the marginalized . ''
All of this is good to hear from the ACLU 's national legal director , although Cole 's defense of the First Amendment is purely instrumental . He says progressives should support freedom of speech because it helps advance their goals , not because using force to silence offensive speakers is unjust or immoral .
That omission may just mean Cole knows his audience . `` The fact that conservatives benefit from the First Amendment is not something to bemoan , '' he says . `` It is part of the constitutional bargain . '' Cole does not assume that so-called liberals will understand there is a principle at stake here , or even what a principle means . That would indeed be a dangerous assumption , judging from the grumbling within his own organization about the freedom that white supremacists and other unsavory characters enjoy under the First Amendment . While Cole 's defense of free speech is encouraging , the need for it is depressing .","David Cole, the American Civil Liberties Union's national legal director, tells New York Times readers they shouldn't ""lose faith in the First Amendment.""

Cole wants progressives to understand the value of this approach, which defends a principle that is useful to the left as well as the right. ""When the Roberts court ruled that the First Amendment prohibited holding the Westboro Baptist Church liable for displaying anti-gay signs outside a military funeral,"" he writes, ""its rationale would equally protect Revolutionary Communist Party demonstrators holding anti-Christian signs outside the Westboro Baptist Church.""

Cole rebuts the idea that neutrality is suspect because it favors the rich and powerful. Actually, he says, ""the First Amendment favors people without power and influence. In a democracy, the rich and those in the majority don't need constitutional protections; they can generally enact their desires through ordinary political processes. The targets of censorship are typically dissidents, outsiders, the marginalized.""

All of this is good to hear from the ACLU's national legal director, although Cole's defense of the First Amendment is purely instrumental. He says progressives should support freedom of speech because it helps advance their goals, not because using force to silence offensive speakers is unjust or immoral.

That omission may just mean Cole knows his audience. ""The fact that conservatives benefit from the First Amendment is not something to bemoan,"" he says. ""It is part of the constitutional bargain."" Cole does not assume that so-called liberals will understand there is a principle at stake here, or even what a principle means. That would indeed be a dangerous assumption, judging from the grumbling within his own organization about the freedom that white supremacists and other unsavory characters enjoy under the First Amendment. While Cole's defense of free speech is encouraging, the need for it is depressing.",www.reason.com,right,ePAw7k5buHAO1V61

Damore is joined in the 161-page suit by another former Google engineer named David Gudeman , who spent three years with Google working on a query engine . According to Gudeman ’ s LinkedIn profile , he left the company in December 2016 and has been self-employed since .
The lawsuit , filed by Dhillon Law Group , says it aims to represent all employees of Google who ’ ve been discriminated against due to their “ perceived conservative political views by Google , ” due to “ their male gender by Google ” and “ due to their Caucasian race by Google . ”
More specifically , it accuses Google of singling out , mistreating and systematically punishing and terminating employees who “ expressed views deviating from the majority view at Google on political subjects raised in the workplace and relevant to Google ’ s employment policies and its business , such as ‘ diversity ’ hiring policies , ‘ bias sensitivity ’ or ‘ social justice ’ … ”
Damore isn ’ t holding back any punches here .

The suit also claims that the “ numerical presence of women celebrated at Google ” was based “ solely due to their gender ” while the “ presence of Caucasians and males was mocked with ‘ boos ’ during companywide weekly meetings . ”
Somewhat redundantly , it adds that Damore , Gudeman and “ other class members ” were “ ostracized , belittled , and punished for their heterodox political views , and for the added sin of their birth circumstances of being Caucasians and/or males . ”

James Damore vs. Google : Class Action Lawsuit by ███ on Scribd","James Damore, a former Google engineer who was fired in August after posting a memo to an internal Google message board arguing that women may not be equally represented in tech because they are biologically less capable of engineering, has filed a class action lawsuit against the company in Santa Clara Superior Court in Northern California.

His claims: that Google unfairly discriminates against white men whose political views are unpopular with its executives.

Damore is joined in the 161-page suit by another former Google engineer named David Gudeman, who spent three years with Google working on a query engine. According to Gudeman’s LinkedIn profile, he left the company in December 2016 and has been self-employed since.

The lawsuit, filed by Dhillon Law Group, says it aims to represent all employees of Google who’ve been discriminated against due to their “perceived conservative political views by Google,” due to “their male gender by Google” and “due to their Caucasian race by Google.”

More specifically, it accuses Google of singling out, mistreating and systematically punishing and terminating employees who “expressed views deviating from the majority view at Google on political subjects raised in the workplace and relevant to Google’s employment policies and its business, such as ‘diversity’ hiring policies, ‘bias sensitivity’ or ‘social justice’…”

Damore isn’t holding back any punches here. According to his filing, Google employs “illegal hiring quotas to fill its desired percentages of women and favored minority candidates, and openly shames managers of business units who fail to meet their quotas—in the process, openly denigrating male and Caucasian employees as less favored than others.”

The suit also claims that the “numerical presence of women celebrated at Google” was based “solely due to their gender” while the “presence of Caucasians and males was mocked with ‘boos’ during companywide weekly meetings.”

Somewhat redundantly, it adds that Damore, Gudeman and “other class members” were “ostracized, belittled, and punished for their heterodox political views, and for the added sin of their birth circumstances of being Caucasians and/or males.”

The lawsuit is seeking monetary, non-monetary and punitive remedies.

Damore’s firing last summer became the talk of the nation, with many in Silicon Valley outraged that Google didn’t act even more swiftly to terminate him. Elsewhere, many wondered whether the firing would have a chilling effect on employees’ ability to openly discuss their viewpoints.

Google said it fired Damore for violating its code of conduct and advancing “harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace.” Damore meanwhile began a kind of press tour, denouncing the company for being close-minded and worse. In an interview with CNBC, for example, he compared being a conservative at Google to “being gay in the 1950s.”

In a press conference this afternoon, Damore’s attorney, Harmeet Dhillon, a California representative for the Republican National Committee, elaborated more on the very lengthy complaint and argued that her current clients are far from alone.

In fact, she said she spoke with “dozens” of employees at Google to formulate the lawsuit and that she expects there will be “future lawsuits” to explore, as well.

To underscore her point that Google’s policies need to be amended, she cited so-called TGIF meetings at Google, telling reporters that during Damore’s tenure, “managers were called out and shamed and mocked if they didn’t have 50/50 gender parity in [their respective] units.” She called the goal “fair” but asked, rhetorically: “How do you get there?

The new suit isn’t the only one Google is having to defend itself against. In September, three female former Google employees filed a lawsuit against the company, saying it discriminates against women. To wit, says the suit, Google pays women at all levels of the company less than men, as well as assigns them lower job tiers with less opportunity for upward mobility.

Last month, a fourth complainant joined their suit.

The Labor Department is separately investigating systemic pay discrimination at Google. The company says it hasn’t found a pay gap in its own analysis.

UCB said there was a credible threat of a repeat performance if Coulter spoke.

Many of my more liberal Twitter followers, loathe to support Coulter on … well … anything, have resisted -- sometimes with desperately creative logic -- the notion that this is an issue of free speech. Here are some of their arguments and my answers:

Them: The First Amendment applies only to government censorship.

Me: You’re right. And UCB is a public institution, supported by taxpayer money, which makes this a government issue.

Them: She’s milking this for publicity.

Me: Maybe. So what?

Them: She doesn’t care about free speech. She’s getting paid.

Me: I get paid when I speak, too. Again, so what?

Them: UCB never actually said she couldn’t speak.

Though the News will keep going, weakened and threatened, this is awful for obvious reasons, not least of all because a two-vigorous-tabloid town is a very good thing. Day to day, there’s a battle fought on the Daily News and Post front pages — “the wood,” in tabloid-speak. Which grabs your attention? Which makes the better joke about de Blasio? Sometimes one fronts the Yankees as the other goes with international news.

The wood reveals more than just straightforward competition. Going back decades, one sees a visual manifestation of fundamentally distinct voices in New York. The News put the legalization of same-sex marriage on the wood (“U.S. GAY!”) as the Post ran a story about a prison escapee gunned down by Border Patrol (“GOTCHA!”). The former Observer editor Tom McGeveran, known for his daily tabloid head-to-heads, pointed this out on Twitter: “The News was always the paper of the ‘people,’ ” he wrote. “Which at one point meant the Union memberships. The Post was the paper of management and power brokers.” That’s often manifested these days in a left-right split, though not always.

These brash, loud instruments force us to interpret the news of the day in public. Two disparate readings are presented on the newsstand, with peerless brevity, and you are pushed into their debate. To see both papers every day is to be drawn into a conversation about what matters, about what news is skewed and what incomplete. Most journalists, as everyone but our president knows, are not out to make any of it fake. But rivalry helps keep things honest, even when they’re utterly sensational.

Here’s a look at their dueling worldviews over the years.

Sessions warned that the media could be a part of that crackdown, and the Justice Department could ask for sources behind leaks. The investigation will include a review of the Justice Department's policies on subpoenas for media outlets that publish sensitive information.

I know . I know . Let me break it down for you :
Merriam-Webster ’ s dictionary defines fascism as “ a political philosophy , movement , or regime ( such as that of the Fascisti ) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader , severe economic and social regimentation , and forcible suppression of opposition . ”
When most people refer to fascism , they are talking about the political ideology of Benito Mussolini , which in turn inspired a little-known up-and-comer named Adolf Hitler , who modeled his Nazi regime after the fascist movement .
At the core of fascism is “ nationalism ” —the belief that a country is a single unit bound together by a common ancestry . I know it sounds antithetical to the entire idea of America , but you know how “ they ” do : They will talk about freedom and liberty while screaming for the Jews to go home . They will talk about their constitutional right to free speech while ignoring the part about equal protection under the law . They can write “ all men are created equal ” while they keep slaves shackled on their plantations .
I understand . Now get to the anti-fascist part , bruh . I ain ’ t got all day .
As the Nazis were taking over Germany , groups like the “ Antifaschistische Komittees ” and “ Antifaschistische Aktionen ” rose in opposition . If you took eighth-grade history , you know they failed . But the groups didn ’ t die out . Instead , these “ antifa ” organizations started hunting down Nazis , because ... well ... they were motherfucking Nazis .
But that was in Germany , right ? What about here in America ?
You know how there ’ s one aunt or uncle who you let come to the cookout , but you let everyone know not to give them a drink because they ’ ll start fighting ... or stripping ... or stripping while they ’ re fighting ? But someone always does , and you ’ re not as mad at Auntie for throwing punches in her bra and panties as you are at the cousin who gave her a cup of Hennessy ?
Well , the antifa movement saw what happened at the last Hitler cookout in Germany and said , “ Before we allow fascism to seep into America and start a naked nationalist strip-fight at America ’ s cookout , we ’ ll just punch the motherfucker in the mouth who ’ s handing out racism in cups of Henny . ”
Basically , they believe ( and rightly so ) that there is nothing worse than fascism . They saw what happened in Germany , and they have pledged to do anything to stop it before it gets going—even if that means violence .
OK , I get it . It ’ s like Malcolm X said : “ By any means necessary . ”

It is hard to say for sure . One of the distinguishing characteristics of wypipo is their infallible ability to lump people into groups and project their notions onto said group . If you speak above a whisper about oppression , Fox News and Caucasians , in general , will label you “ a member of Black Lives Matter . ”
The problem with the antifa movement is that many of them are anarchists who don ’ t believe in organized institutions , so it is hard to tell what their beliefs are . Some of them believe that if the public sees that there are more anti-fascists than there are white supremacists , regular , fence-riding citizens won ’ t feel pressured to join the fascist movements out of popularity . Some of them believe in fighting fascism with education . And some of them believe that the only way to fight tyranny is with force .
And by “ force , ” you mean violence ? Isn ’ t that stooping down to their level ?
Maybe . Or maybe the only way to fight bullies is to stand up to them . Remember all the groups we talked about earlier ? Nazis , the Klan , neo-Confederates , skinheads and white nationalists all have one thing in common : a desire to “ make America great again ” by slowly ridding the county of ethnic diversity . Whether it is anti-immigration laws , lynching , marginalization or radical Caucasian terrorism , they all advocate some version of ethnic cleansing that is , at its base , violent .
It is impossible to stop this kind of violence with signs , freedom songs and nonviolent resistance . Anti-fascists know that tactic has never worked in the history of the world .
But what about the civil rights struggle ? Wasn ’ t that nonviolent ?
Nope . The civil rights movement was extremely violent . Ask the people in Birmingham , Ala. , who had their skin ripped away by police dogs and fire hoses . Ask the Freedom Riders who were firebombed . Ask the children beaten with police batons on the Edmund Pettus Bridge . Ask the crack in John Lewis ’ skull .

In his defense of terrorist extremist factions, the president also lumped in the anti-fascist (or “antifa”) movement.

“It’s an especially ridiculous overreach coming from a president who supposedly hates regulation. It’s built on anecdotes about bias rather than research. It pretends that the liability shield Congress provided in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act enabled Big Tech companies to become global behemoths, rather than feckless antitrust enforcement. And it ignores the fact that the tech giants can survive without Section 230, while the upstarts that would compete with them cannot…



“We all have complaints about how powerful Big Tech has become and how the various companies do and do not enforce their terms of service. But having the government regulate those decisions won’t make them better. It will only force the companies to bend their policies to the whims of whichever administration happens to be in power.”

He begins with an anecdote :
When I was a youngish teenager , I went to the bank one day . ( This was pre-ATM machines , kids . ) I stood in line behind a very old , very properly dressed white lady , complete with the sort of fancy hat that I still don ’ t know the proper name for . When she got to the teller , I didn ’ t pay attention at first but , very quickly , my ears perked up . She earned my attention because this prim old woman was passionately raining racial epithets at the bank teller , who was an Asian-American woman . I have no idea what the bank teller ’ s specific ethnicity was . But the old lady seemed to roam the waterfront between “ nips , ” “ gooks , ” “ slants , ” etc . “ You damn gooks killed my husband and my son ! ” I distinctly remember her saying .
The moral , Goldberg says , is this : “ The old lady was wrong to do what she did . She may have had plenty of rationalizations and explanations for why she tormented that young woman — but none of them added up to an excuse . ”
Much of the Jeong furor has been about actually racist alt-right trolls weaponizing old tweets in bad faith to get an Asian woman fired from an important job . The New York Times refused to be cowed , and good for them . ( Also do read my ███ Media colleagues at The Verge , who wrote a powerful statement condemning the cynicism of these tactics , and defending Jeong ’ s excellent work . )
But Goldberg ’ s piece traces another fault line in the Jeong debate , one that I see people of good faith struggling with even days after the initial frenzy , and that has implications far beyond this single controversy . Are Jeong ’ s tweets the equivalent of Goldberg ’ s old woman yelling racial slurs at a bank teller — that is to say , are they an actual expression of animus towards real people ? Or are the critics making that argument engaged in an absurd form of literalism , refusing to recognize ironic discourse even though it ’ s been repeatedly pointed out to them ?
Goldberg got to tell a story , so now I ’ d like to tell one . A few years ago , it became popular on feminist Twitter to tweet about the awful effects of patriarchal culture and attach the line # KillAllMen . This became popular enough that a bunch of people I know and hang out with and even love began using it in casual conversation .
And you know what ? I didn ’ t like it . It made me feel defensive . It still makes me feel defensive . I ’ m a man , and I recoil hearing people I care about say all men should be killed .
But I also knew that wasn ’ t what they were saying . They didn ’ t want me put to death . They didn ’ t want any men put to death . They didn ’ t hate me , and they didn ’ t hate men . “ # KillAllMen ” was another way of saying “ it would be nice if the world sucked less for women. ” It was an expression of frustration with pervasive sexism . I didn ’ t enjoy the way they said it , but that didn ’ t mean I had to pretend I couldn ’ t figure out what they meant . And if I had any questions , I could , you know , ask , and actually listen to the answer .
Here ’ s the other thing , though : all that was happening inside my community , which both inclined me towards generosity , and gave me more context for what was going on . If I had been on the outside of it , perhaps my ultimate reaction would ’ ve been different , perhaps I would ’ ve let my initial offense drive my interpretation .
The same dynamic seems to me to be at play in the way “ white people ” is used in Jeong ’ s jokes . On social justice Twitter , the term means something closer to “ the dominant power structure and culture ” than it does to actual white people . To read “ # CancelWhitePeople ” and think Jeong is calling for genocide , as New York magazine ’ s Andrew Sullivan apparently does , is absurd . And to sit around wondering how the social justice left would respond if you completely changed the context , intent , and meaning of the tweets by subbing in the names of different groups , well , read Zack Beauchamp on that .
But after reading take after take after take on the latest round of our ongoing Twitter wars , I ’ m struck by how inexplicable both sides seem to the other . To much of the right , it ’ s obvious that Jeong ’ s tweets represented anti-white racism in its purest form ; to much of the left , it ’ s obvious they were jokes that anyone with an iota of self-awareness could parse , and the affront taken at them is pure bad faith .
Jeong ’ s statement seemed , to me , to offer a much more persuasive middle road : These were satirical tweets framed in a way that could reasonably offend people who didn ’ t understand the context for what they were reading :
The real villain here , as it so often is , is Twitter .
We ’ ve had a lot of Twitter dustups in recent months , and most of them seem to hinge on the same problem : We don ’ t know how to interpret what ’ s written on Twitter , and that ’ s been repeatedly weaponized by people who do know how to interpret what ’ s on Twitter .
Twitter is weird . A huge amount of what ’ s written there is metatextual commentary on other tweets intended for a knowing audience reading in a specific moment . It ’ s an ephemeral , self-referential mode of discourse that is unfortunately not ephemeral or tied to reference points at all — in fact , it ’ s designed to be broadcast , archived , searched , and embedded by anyone , in any context , at any point in the future .
There ’ s a term for this : It ’ s called “ context collapse. ” danah boyd , who may or may not have coined the term , explained it in a paper co-written with Alice Marwick :
Every participant in a communicative act has an imagined audience . Audiences are not discrete ; when we talk , we think we are speaking only to the people in front of us or on the other end of the telephone , but this is in many ways a fantasy . ( Social norms against eavesdropping show how ‘ privacy ’ requires the participation of bystanders . ) Technology complicates our metaphors of space and place , including the belief that audiences are separate from each other . We may understand that the Twitter or Facebook audience is potentially limitless , but we often act as if it were bounded . Our understanding of the social media audience is limited . While anyone can potentially read or view a digital artifact , we need a more specific conception of audience than ‘ anyone ’ to choose the language , cultural referents , style , and so on that comprise online identity presentation .
We write for an audience we think we know , in a vernacular they ’ ll understand , using reference points they ’ re familiar with . Six years later , our tweets are weaponized to an audience we don ’ t know , thick with terms they understand differently , with the reference points completely absent .
There happened to be a particularly amusing bit of context collapse buried in this whole saga . One of Jeong ’ s most vocal critics was Sullivan , who wrote a slashing column accusing her of “ eliminationist ” rhetoric , among other sins . Turns out one of the tweets he was referencing was about him , though he didn ’ t know it and certainly didn ’ t take the time to trace it back and find out :

It ’ s not just context collapse , though . Part of constructing your community on Twitter is bounding it . Part of winning retweets and likes is sending missives your community will love . Given how human beings police group boundaries , that means making jokes only your friends understand , slamming common enemies , expressing sentiments in ways that signal group belonging .
Twitter is a medium that rewards us for snark , for sick burns , for edgy jokes and cruel comments that deepen the grooves of our group . And then it ’ s designed to make the sickest of those burns and the worst of those jokes go viral , reaching far beyond their intended audience , with untold consequences . That ’ s good for engagement on the platform , but it ’ s often bad for the people it happens to .
The canonical example is Justine Sacco , a PR executive who was bored during a 2013 layover at Heathrow and tweeted the bad joke , “ Going to Africa . Hope I don ’ t get AIDS . Just kidding . I ’ m white ! ” The tweet went viral , Sacco ’ s name was trending nationally as she was in the air , and she ’ d lost her job by the time she landed .
Sacco ’ s joke fell flat ( clearly ) , but it was meant as a commentary on privilege for an audience of people she thought she knew , whom she thought would read her generously . Then , of course , it was flung across the world , to audiences that didn ’ t know her and had no interest in reading her generously , and it upended her life .
In the aftermath , the internet has more or less admitted that it went way too far with that one , and some of the instigators apologized . But we ’ ve learned few of the lessons , as the recent James Gunn fiasco proved .
Twitter is not your friend . It is built to reward us for snarky in-group communication and designed to encourage unintended out-group readership . It fosters both tribalism and tribal collision . It seduces you into thinking you ’ re writing for one community but it gives everyone the ability to search your words and project them forward in time and space and outward into another community at the point when it ’ ll do you maximum damage . It leaves you explaining jokes that can ’ t be explained to employers that don ’ t like jokes anyway .
And it ’ s not just what we write . It ’ s what we see . Our feeds are filled with reasonable , funny , thoughtful comments from our groups and the most unreasonable , offensive tweets sent by our out-groups .
If you ’ re a conservative , the liberal tweets that get shot into your sightline aren ’ t the most thoughtful or representative missives ; they ’ re the ones designed to make you think liberals hate you , are idiots , or both . The same is true if you ’ re a liberal : you see the worst of the right , not the best . And after you ’ ve seen enough of these kinds of comments from the other side , you begin to think that ’ s who they are , that you ’ re getting a true picture of what your opponents are really like , and what they really think of you — but it ’ s not a true picture , it ’ s a distortion built to deepen your attachment to your friends , your resentment of your opponents , and your engagement on the platform . And it ’ s one that plays on our tendencies to read the other side with much less generosity than we read our own side .
The very first tweet was sent in 2006 . This is a young medium , and over time , we ’ ll ( hopefully ) figure it out — how to interpret it , how to couch it , how to delete old tweets automatically . But for now , the lesson is clear : # NeverTweet .

And there is a growing movement across our college campuses to shut down free speech of teachers , students and invited guests . This should scare the hell out of all us all .
I ’ ve been doing talk radio for more than three decades and I host a daily podcast . This means I constantly have guests on who disagree with me on many subjects . Challenging their ideas and points of views — while they do the same to me — is an important part of the public discourse . One thing I ’ ve learned about Americans from talking with them for more than 30 years is that we like to argue and debate , even among friends — and we ’ re damn good at it .
The element of debate is a hallmark of our country , from the time of Sam Adams . By the way , he was not named after the beer , the beer was named after him . So , if you learn nothing else from today , hang on to that .

This right has been reaffirmed through our history . It ’ s been fought for , and people have died for it . We must understand that we have the right to free expression , not the right to not be offended . This fundamental difference is being lost on today ’ s college campuses .
We should not be teaching students to retreat from debate , but to charge intellectually into it . This is one of the most valuable and profound gifts given to us in the founding of America .
When we enter into robust debate , the best ideas will most often rise . It ’ s when ideas and points of view are censored that our country loses , because we may miss new ideas or other ones may not have been properly examined .
I used to love to play colleges as a comedian . College campuses were a fantastic place to perform , but today the negatively-charged environment where everyone is offended has made it toxic . It ’ s so bad that some of the top comedians , including Jerry Seinfeld , Bill Maher and Chris Rock — not exactly a right-wing cabal — have noted that performing on a college campus is no longer a real option due to the labyrinth of speech codes and hurt feelings .
As comedians , we find subjects , which often includes stereotypes . Then , we make social commentary or a joke about it . String enough of those together and you have a routine . And here ’ s a window into my business : Offending people is the foundation of what comedians do . Finding a moment , person , group or idea and holding it up for ridicule has been a part of comedy since the very first joke ever told .
Someone will almost always be offended ; it ’ s risky , but if you ’ re a good comedian the joke will reveal a truth we can all recognize . Without this , we ’ re all just sitting in a dark theater buying two overpriced drinks . Comedians are the modern-day court jesters holding the mirror of truth back up to society .
I also know that what happens at college does not stay at college . Given this generation ’ s impulse to post every moment of life online , nothing they do will stay in college . In fact , it will haunt them from job interview to job interview . There seems to be a growing movement to shut down differing points of view that are not politically correct or fit neatly into today ’ s “ speech codes , ” which are nothing short of thought-regulation .
The centrifuge of this movement is ironically the college campus — the place that has traditionally been the center of the free exchange of ideas . Instead , colleges now have places known as “ safe spaces ” where students who feel threatened by concepts , ideas , differing views , other ethnicities or different economic or geographical backgrounds may retreat .
We currently have more than 20 million people attending colleges or degree-granting programs . This is up from 17.8 million in 2006 . That ’ s a lot of trigger warnings and play-doh and puppy crap to pick up from safe spaces if we continue down the coddling road . But I digress .
I ’ ve also seen how speakers have faced being shut down , intimidated from speaking and even physically assaulted on campus . I recently faced being shut down when nationally-syndicated radio host Dennis Prager and I planned to hold an event at Cal State Northridge in California . The producers of the event confirmed the rental of the facilities , and then , suddenly , two weeks prior to the event , were told the school did not want to have controversial speakers such as Dennis and myself on campus .
Me , I can understand the offense , but Dennis , he ’ s just really tall and really smart . This was later deemed a “ scheduling conflict ” not a “ content conflict ” . Eventually , after lawyers jumped in , the scheduling conflict was resolved , and the event was held . It also produced a No . 1 iTunes comedy album . But it showed me up close what is happening on campus . To be candid , it shocked me , because our colleges should be an important place that embraces free speech , intellectual diversity and challenging ideas .
What is provided in these safe spaces , and why is it a problem ? Instead of fostering the development of young adults , colleges are providing coloring books , play-doh , puppies and stuffed animals . It ’ s basically your four-year-old daughter ’ s bedroom where one can shut out the challenges , facts and outside world . Providing this bubble-wrapped type of education does not prepare the next generation for the challenges of life . It prepares them for failure .
Can you imagine a student like this getting a job in customer service for an IT company where millions of dollars are on the line , and rather than being able to address or fix a problem , they will need play-do and puppies to get through the day ?
We also hear a cry for diversity on college campuses , which is total boloney . Diversity by definition doesn ’ t just mean differing races , genders or ethnicities coexisting . True diversity is intellectual diversity , where differing points of view and ideas can be discussed , even the ones we vehemently disagree with . True diversity requires points of view we disagree with , otherwise it won ’ t be diverse , only self re-affirming .
But this definition of diversity does not seem to fit within the current college campus . The definition being pushed is not one of true diversity , but reaffirming already approved thoughts . It ’ s basically like we ’ re dressing ideological uniformity in a cheap supermarket costume but calling it diversity . We all know the real kid behind the mask , but students and teachers are forced to go along with the charade .
This point couldn ’ t be made any clearer than by Sol Stern , one of the co-founders of the Berkeley Free Speech Movement in the 1960s . Stern , looking back 50 years later on what he saw as the failure of the original Free Speech Movement observed , “ Because the claim that the FSM was fighting for free speech for all ( i.e. , the First Amendment ) was always a charade . Within weeks of FSM ’ s founding , it became clear to the leadership that the struggle was really about clearing barriers to using the campus as a base for radical political activity . Our movement ignored Orwell ’ s warning that ‘ political language is designed to make lies sound truthful . ’ ”
Orwell was right , and 50 years later , the climate on college campuses is growing worse . The stated goal of diversity has been one of inclusion , but the recent growth of “ identity politics ” has reversed this to ultimately promote exclusion , nearly indiscernible from Jim Crow laws of the 1940s .
While our national motto is “ E Pluribus Unum , ” or “ out of many , one , ” identity politics creates a divisive power play on the pattern of basing one ’ s identity on characterizations like race , gender , class , sexual orientation , religion and on down the line in as many divided categories of oppression as one can imagine .
Ultimately this movement against challenging ideas is a disservice to students , as they ’ re not being prepared for the world outside their “ safe spaces. ” Instead , their diplomas — some of which cost in the mid-six figures — will have actually set them back . I think the only thing worse than being uneducated is being mis-educated .
Adam Carolla is a comedian , television host , actor , podcaster , author and director . He hosts `` The Adam Carolla Show , '' which set the Guinness World record in 2011 for `` most downloaded podcast . '' He and Dennis Prager are currently filming a documentary , `` No Safe Spaces , '' which explores political correctness on college campuses .
Th views expressed by contributors are their own and not the views of The Hill .","As someone who makes his living by challenging ideas through humor, social commentary and, if warranted, ridicule, I care deeply about free speech. And there is a growing movement across our college campuses to shut down free speech of teachers, students and invited guests. This should scare the hell out of all us all.

The element of debate is a hallmark of our country, from the time of Sam Adams. By the way, he was not named after the beer, the beer was named after him. So, if you learn nothing else from today, hang on to that.

But seriously, America has been that “safe space” where truth can be spoken to power. Where “We the People” can challenge a king and a corrupt idea like a monarchy. This right has been reaffirmed through our history. It’s been fought for, and people have died for it. We must understand that we have the right to free expression, not the right to not be offended. This fundamental difference is being lost on today’s college campuses.

We should not be teaching students to retreat from debate, but to charge intellectually into it. This is one of the most valuable and profound gifts given to us in the founding of America.

When we enter into robust debate, the best ideas will most often rise. It’s when ideas and points of view are censored that our country loses, because we may miss new ideas or other ones may not have been properly examined.

Finding a moment, person, group or idea and holding it up for ridicule has been a part of comedy since the very first joke ever told.

Someone will almost always be offended; it’s risky, but if you’re a good comedian the joke will reveal a truth we can all recognize. Without this, we’re all just sitting in a dark theater buying two overpriced drinks. Comedians are the modern-day court jesters holding the mirror of truth back up to society.

I also know that what happens at college does not stay at college. Given this generation’s impulse to post every moment of life online, nothing they do will stay in college. In fact, it will haunt them from job interview to job interview. There seems to be a growing movement to shut down differing points of view that are not politically correct or fit neatly into today’s “speech codes,” which are nothing short of thought-regulation.

The centrifuge of this movement is ironically the college campus — the place that has traditionally been the center of the free exchange of ideas. Instead, colleges now have places known as “safe spaces” where students who feel threatened by concepts, ideas, differing views, other ethnicities or different economic or geographical backgrounds may retreat.

We currently have more than 20 million people attending colleges or degree-granting programs. This is up from 17.8 million in 2006. That’s a lot of trigger warnings and play-doh and puppy crap to pick up from safe spaces if we continue down the coddling road. But I digress.

I’ve also seen how speakers have faced being shut down, intimidated from speaking and even physically assaulted on campus. I recently faced being shut down when nationally-syndicated radio host Dennis Prager and I planned to hold an event at Cal State Northridge in California. The producers of the event confirmed the rental of the facilities, and then, suddenly, two weeks prior to the event, were told the school did not want to have controversial speakers such as Dennis and myself on campus.

Me, I can understand the offense, but Dennis, he’s just really tall and really smart. This was later deemed a “scheduling conflict” not a “content conflict”. Eventually, after lawyers jumped in, the scheduling conflict was resolved, and the event was held. It also produced a No. 1 iTunes comedy album. But it showed me up close what is happening on campus. To be candid, it shocked me, because our colleges should be an important place that embraces free speech, intellectual diversity and challenging ideas.

What is provided in these safe spaces, and why is it a problem? Instead of fostering the development of young adults, colleges are providing coloring books, play-doh, puppies and stuffed animals. It’s basically your four-year-old daughter’s bedroom where one can shut out the challenges, facts and outside world. Providing this bubble-wrapped type of education does not prepare the next generation for the challenges of life. It prepares them for failure.

Can you imagine a student like this getting a job in customer service for an IT company where millions of dollars are on the line, and rather than being able to address or fix a problem, they will need play-do and puppies to get through the day?

We also hear a cry for diversity on college campuses, which is total boloney. Diversity by definition doesn’t just mean differing races, genders or ethnicities coexisting. True diversity is intellectual diversity, where differing points of view and ideas can be discussed, even the ones we vehemently disagree with. True diversity requires points of view we disagree with, otherwise it won’t be diverse, only self re-affirming.

But this definition of diversity does not seem to fit within the current college campus. The definition being pushed is not one of true diversity, but reaffirming already approved thoughts. It’s basically like we’re dressing ideological uniformity in a cheap supermarket costume but calling it diversity. We all know the real kid behind the mask, but students and teachers are forced to go along with the charade.

This point couldn’t be made any clearer than by Sol Stern, one of the co-founders of the Berkeley Free Speech Movement in the 1960s. Stern, looking back 50 years later on what he saw as the failure of the original Free Speech Movement observed, “Because the claim that the FSM was fighting for free speech for all (i.e., the First Amendment) was always a charade. Within weeks of FSM’s founding, it became clear to the leadership that the struggle was really about clearing barriers to using the campus as a base for radical political activity. Our movement ignored Orwell’s warning that ‘political language is designed to make lies sound truthful.’”

Orwell was right, and 50 years later, the climate on college campuses is growing worse. The stated goal of diversity has been one of inclusion, but the recent growth of “identity politics” has reversed this to ultimately promote exclusion, nearly indiscernible from Jim Crow laws of the 1940s.

While our national motto is “E Pluribus Unum,” or “out of many, one,” identity politics creates a divisive power play on the pattern of basing one’s identity on characterizations like race, gender, class, sexual orientation, religion and on down the line in as many divided categories of oppression as one can imagine.

Ultimately this movement against challenging ideas is a disservice to students, as they’re not being prepared for the world outside their “safe spaces.” Instead, their diplomas — some of which cost in the mid-six figures — will have actually set them back. I think the only thing worse than being uneducated is being mis-educated.

Adam Carolla is a comedian, television host, actor, podcaster, author and director. He hosts ""The Adam Carolla Show,"" which set the Guinness World record in 2011 for ""most downloaded podcast."" He and Dennis Prager are currently filming a documentary, ""No Safe Spaces,"" which explores political correctness on college campuses.

Former Charlottesville, Va., mayor Michael Signer argues that we must restrict speech to maintain the rule of law. He couldn’t be more wrong.

‘Two things form the bedrock of any open society,” Salman Rushdie once noted, “freedom of expression and rule of law. If you don’t have those things, you don’t have a free country.”

Well, in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed, “How Free Speech Dogma Failed Us in Charlottesville,” Michael Signer, the former mayor of Charlottesville, makes the argument that restricting speech is necessary for the rule of law.

The first problem with Signer’s case is the premise itself. Sorry, but we have no uniquely pressing need to “keep pace” with violent or threatening “political disruptions.” Americans live in era of relatively little political violence. A person doesn’t even have to go back to the brutality of the1860s and 1870s to understand this; they can just look back at the 1960s and 1970s, or maybe even the 1990s.

When a few hundred Nazis, in a nation of 350 million, get together and march down Main Street, that isn’t a particularly compelling reason to rethink our rights. In 1939, well after Hitler’s tyrannical intentions were known, 20,000 Nazi sympathizers filled up Madison Square Garden. There will always be extremists in America. Which is one reason why we must always do our best to safeguard natural rights.

Signer, though, seems to feel differently:

With white nationalists chanting “Jews will not replace us” in the streets of Charlottesville and far-left demonstrators vandalizing college campuses in response to speakers they don’t like, we need First Amendment rules that return to common sense, not high-minded ideas that seem sound on paper but fail to keep us safe and free in practice.

Far-left demonstrators’ “vandalizing college campuses” in response to speakers they dislike are attempting to suppress speech, not engaging in speech. They are criminals whose actions make a great argument for free-speech absolutism and the rule of law. Does Signer believe that we should restrict speech to pacify the would-be criminal censor or placate the would-be bigot and murderer? That would set a destructive precedent for reasons beyond protecting speech. The Nazi who rammed his car into a crowd at the “Unite the Right” rally in 2017, murdering a woman and injuring dozens of others, was sentenced to over 400 years in jail, not given a say over how we mete out speech rights.

The bottom line is that once we start creating “rules” for speech — once we abandon the principled protection of content-neutral expression — our words will be subjected to the vagaries of politics, the biases of voters, and the interpretations of bureaucrats.

free_speech,American Spectator,2,https://spectator.org/silicon-valleys-libertarian-paradise-lost/,Silicon Valley’s Libertarian Paradise Lost,,"Daniel J. Flynn, Greg Jones, Chris Talgo, Emma Kaden, Dominick Sansone, Jeffrey Lord, Melissa Mackenzie","Not since Jerry Maguire circulated his mission statement at Sports Management International has an internal memo so backfired on its author as James Damore ’ s written thoughts on the tech world ’ s groupthink did .
The Google engineer wrote that “ when it comes to diversity and inclusion , Google ’ s left bias has created a politically correct monoculture that maintains its hold by shaming dissenters into silence . This silence removes any checks against encroaching extremist and authoritarian policies . ”
More chilling than the actions of the executives are the opinions of the employees . Just a slight majority of Google ’ s employees disagreed with the company axing the engineer for reasons unrelated to his job . A minority of Apple , Lyft , and LinkedIn workers disagreed with Google ’ s actions . Silicon Valley ’ s libertarian paradise lost more closely resembles the college campuses from where its credentialed inhabitants came . Company men ( and company women here and there ) toil in the massive Northern California company town .
“ Google ’ s Ideological Echo Chamber , ” the controversial 3,000+ word firing offense , argued that we should not reflexively attribute differences in gender representation in the workplace to discrimination . Men and women exhibit different traits . Perhaps nature draws males to such fields and women to other fields .
“ Only facts and reason can shed light on these biases , ” Damore writes , “ but discriminating just to increase the representation of women in tech is as misguided and biased as mandating increases for women ’ s representation in the homeless , work-related and violent deaths , prisons , and school dropouts . ”
Damore explains that a 12-hour flight back to the United States from a diversity seminar in China catalyzed the memo . Apparently , the sensitivity training did not affect him as intended .
And that ’ s the rub with diversity , tolerance , sensitivity , and other progressive shibboleths . Proselytizing occasionally unleashes the opposite of the intended effect . And the people committed to those principles often violate them in pursuit of them ( hence James Damore standing in the unemployment line ) .
Some people miss their own irony . They silence in the name of tolerance , discriminate in the name of fighting discrimination , and react to microaggressions with macroaggressions . The glorious ends justify the ignoble means . Unfortunately , the ends never come . We get the mean means over and over again .
Google grew into a $ 200 billion behemoth befitting of its name because its founders cultivated it in the United States , the most fertile ground for freedom of speech . Its popularity springs not from it excluding controversial topics from its search engine but because it exists as an index of everything . If the government adopted the intolerant principles of Google , then Google would not exist . Google welcomes pornographers , skinheads , libelers , and other loathsome types in its cyberspace . Google can not endure James Damore working for it . Hmmm .
Web surfers thankfully possess the power to look up any topic through Google .

Big PC Bro is watching.

Not since Jerry Maguire circulated his mission statement at Sports Management International has an internal memo so backfired on its author as James Damore’s written thoughts on the tech world’s groupthink did.

The Google engineer wrote that “when it comes to diversity and inclusion, Google’s left bias has created a politically correct monoculture that maintains its hold by shaming dissenters into silence. This silence removes any checks against encroaching extremist and authoritarian policies.”

Google quickly terminated Damore (Maybe Brendan Eich is hiring).

Point proved. But at what cost?

More chilling than the actions of the executives are the opinions of the employees. Just a slight majority of Google’s employees disagreed with the company axing the engineer for reasons unrelated to his job. A minority of Apple, Lyft, and LinkedIn workers disagreed with Google’s actions. Silicon Valley’s libertarian paradise lost more closely resembles the college campuses from where its credentialed inhabitants came. Company men (and company women here and there) toil in the massive Northern California company town.

“Google’s Ideological Echo Chamber,” the controversial 3,000+ word firing offense, argued that we should not reflexively attribute differences in gender representation in the workplace to discrimination. Men and women exhibit different traits. Perhaps nature draws males to such fields and women to other fields.

“Only facts and reason can shed light on these biases,” Damore writes, “but discriminating just to increase the representation of women in tech is as misguided and biased as mandating increases for women’s representation in the homeless, work-related and violent deaths, prisons, and school dropouts.”

Damore explains that a 12-hour flight back to the United States from a diversity seminar in China catalyzed the memo. Apparently, the sensitivity training did not affect him as intended.

And that’s the rub with diversity, tolerance, sensitivity, and other progressive shibboleths. Proselytizing occasionally unleashes the opposite of the intended effect. And the people committed to those principles often violate them in pursuit of them (hence James Damore standing in the unemployment line).

Some people miss their own irony. They silence in the name of tolerance, discriminate in the name of fighting discrimination, and react to microaggressions with macroaggressions. The glorious ends justify the ignoble means. Unfortunately, the ends never come. We get the mean means over and over again.

Google grew into a $200 billion behemoth befitting of its name because its founders cultivated it in the United States, the most fertile ground for freedom of speech. Its popularity springs not from it excluding controversial topics from its search engine but because it exists as an index of everything. If the government adopted the intolerant principles of Google, then Google would not exist. Google welcomes pornographers, skinheads, libelers, and other loathsome types in its cyberspace. Google cannot endure James Damore working for it. Hmmm.

Web surfers thankfully possess the power to look up any topic through Google. They also retain the power to search through Bing, Yahoo, and even AskJeeves (though he now goes by another web moniker). Why signal to such a large portion of humanity that they welcome their page visits to Google but forbid their views in the Googleplex?

Big Google, like Big Government, senses that it is too big to fail, too big to fall, and too big to boycott. Maybe the company’s executives are right. But that doesn’t make them right to do wrong — even when, as a private entity, they possess the right to commit such a wrong.

Leon Trotsky, an idea man behind the Russian Revolution, reflected on the total state’s intolerance after falling afoul of the one he helped create.

“In a country where the sole employer is the state, opposition means death by slow starvation,” Trotsky, who felt the ice pick as sure as Robespierre felt the guillotine, famously observed. “The old principle: who does not work shall not eat, has been replaced by a new one: who does not obey shall not eat.”

Believe it or not, ‘housewife’ is still a badge of honor for some.

Cardiff Metropolitan University in Wales is instructing its students and teachers to not use “potentially discriminatory” words like “homosexual” and “housewife.”

There are a total of 34 no-no words listed on the school’s “Code of Practice on Using Inclusive Language” list, which aims to promote “fairness and equality through raising awareness about the effects of potentially discriminatory vocabulary,” according to an article in The Independent.

Other forbidden words include “mankind,” “forefathers,” and “Miss/Mrs.” The code also suggests some replacements. For example: The guide deems the words “homosexual” and “heterosexual” to be “laden with the values of a previous time,” and so it recommends “referring to ‘same-sex’ and ‘other-sex’ relationships” instead. Other suggested swaps include using “Ms.” instead of “Miss/Mrs.” (“unless a specific preference has been stated”), “humanity, humankind, human race, people” instead of “mankind,” “and “shopper, consumer, homemaker (depends on context)” instead of “housewife.”

free_speech,Matt Welch,2,http://reason.com/blog/2018/04/06/newspapers-care-much-more-about-bashing,Newspapers Care Much More About Bashing Sinclair Than Criticizing an Unconstitutional Attack on Free Speech,2018-04-06,"Scott Shackford, David Post, Josh Blackman, Shikha Dalmia, Jacob Sullum, Elizabeth Nolan Brown, Eric Boehm, Ilya Somin, Mike Riggs","If Jesus was right about how ye shall know them by their fruits , then we might have a good test case for gleaning what the journalism establishment ( such as a thing exists ) considers an important threat to a free press .
In one corner we have a must-run cookie-cutter anti- '' fake news '' promotional video ordered up by the conservative-leaning Sinclair Broadcast Group to its most-in-the-nation 193 local-TV-news outlets , at a time when the company 's controversial merger with Tribune Co. is being held up by anti-trust regulators at the Justice Department . In the other we have a Sex Trafficking Act passed overwhelmingly by Congress ( 388-25 in the House , 97-2 in the Senate ) despite being vociferously opposed on free speech grounds by the American Civil Liberties Union , the Electronic Frontier Foundation , and reliable civil libertarians such as Sen. Rand Paul ( R-Ky. ) and Sen. Ron Wyden ( D-Oregon ) , the latter of whom warned that `` Civic organizations protecting their right to free speech could be [ ruined ] by their more powerful political opponents '' and that subsequently there could be `` an enormous chilling effect on speech in America . ''
So : The act of an individual company possibly flattering its regulator while mandating politically tinged content , versus the act of the federal government knowingly limiting speech in such a way the Justice Department has warned might be unconstitutional , and that has already prompted some prominent websites to self-censor . The choice seems clear to me .
As a stand-in for what the journalism class prioritizes , I 'll use newspaper editorials . Searching both Nexis and Google News on `` editorial '' and `` sex trafficking act '' and `` Sinclair , '' here is what I found over the past couple of months :
* Sex Trafficking Act : 3 4 * newspaper editorials , 2 of them in favor .
* Sinclair Broadcast : 15 newspaper editorials , 14 of them critical of Sinclair , 5 supporting federal government intervention , and exactly 1 criticizing Sinclair while telling the feds to back off .
Let 's reward the good behavior first . Here is an Orange County Register editorial concluding that the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act ( FOSTA ) is `` well-meaning '' but `` wrong . '' Sample :
FOSTA 's penalties not only use the precautionary principle to justify a sweeping suppression of consensual communication , they also force private online companies like Craigslist to unwillingly shoehorn the precautionary principle into their business model . On top of these flaws , FOSTA commits one more sin . Now that websites face a one-strike-you're-out law on precautionary grounds , the door is open to more laws doing the same . In a free society , that 's impermissible . FOSTA is a big mistake .
That 's it ! There 's your one American newspaper * editorial criticizing a probably unconstitutional clampdown on free speech . By contrast , this Kansas City Star mastheader does not even mention that a free-speech objection exists , instead exulting in the `` bipartisan win '' and how `` this fight was worth it '' :
Ever since the wildly lucrative world of sex trafficking moved from the streets to the internet , market leaders in commercial sex advertising like Backpage have hidden behind an antiquated section of the Communications Decency Act . The act provided Backpage with what [ Sen. Claire ] McCaskill called `` complete and total immunity from being held accountable for their bad behavior . ''
As for the Sinclair dogpile , I previously pointed out the Boston Globe 's remarkably shortsighted conclusion that political slant itself is one good reason for the federal government to block the company 's expansion . But do n't sleep on the St. Louis Post-Dispatch : `` In reality , the eerily Orwellian video , which quickly went viral , makes the case against the Sinclair-Tribune deal , '' the paper wrote . `` Trump told a verified average of 5.6 public lies per day in his first year in office . Yet Sinclair avoids questioning his veracity . Talk about dangerous for democracy . '' Talk about non-hyperlinked assertions !
Sinclair is already `` too big '' ( The Riverdale Press ) , its proposed merger is `` chilling to contemplate '' ( Chicago Daily Herald ) and downright `` dangerous '' ( Modesto Bee ) , `` not just because it 's anti-competitive but because it represents a danger to ethical broadcast journalism . ''
Demonstrating an apparently rare ability to separate journalistic revulsion from a will to government power was the Richmond Times Dispatch , in an editorial headlined `` The Sinclair story just got worse , thanks to U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin . '' Excerpt :
Sinclair 's mistake was to turn a platitude into creepy Orwellian propaganda . But some things are worse than creepy Orwellian propaganda . Actual Orwellian behavior by government officials , for instance . The other day Sen. Dick Durbin sent a letter to Sinclair . `` I 'm calling on Sinclair to explain itself , '' Durbin tweeted . Durbin is upset that Sinclair told Durbin 's staff it does n't dictate local content . In other words , Sinclair lied . ( Members of Congress would never do such a thing themselves , right ? ) Durbin instructs Sinclair to `` clarify '' its policies concerning both content and personnel . Stop right there… . We 're no fans of Sinclair 's message or its methods . But principles of press freedom matter more than petty spats . So we hope Sinclair will tell Durbin to go jump in a lake .

* Update : I 'm both happy and not surprised to learn that my former colleagues at the L.A. Times gave an editorial warning about the sex trafficking bills last month .","If Jesus was right about how ye shall know them by their fruits, then we might have a good test case for gleaning what the journalism establishment (such as a thing exists) considers an important threat to a free press.

In one corner we have a must-run cookie-cutter anti-""fake news"" promotional video ordered up by the conservative-leaning Sinclair Broadcast Group to its most-in-the-nation 193 local-TV-news outlets, at a time when the company's controversial merger with Tribune Co. is being held up by anti-trust regulators at the Justice Department. In the other we have a Sex Trafficking Act passed overwhelmingly by Congress (388-25 in the House, 97-2 in the Senate) despite being vociferously opposed on free speech grounds by the American Civil Liberties Union, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and reliable civil libertarians such as Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon), the latter of whom warned that ""Civic organizations protecting their right to free speech could be [ruined] by their more powerful political opponents"" and that subsequently there could be ""an enormous chilling effect on speech in America.""

So: The act of an individual company possibly flattering its regulator while mandating politically tinged content, versus the act of the federal government knowingly limiting speech in such a way the Justice Department has warned might be unconstitutional, and that has already prompted some prominent websites to self-censor. The choice seems clear to me.

As a stand-in for what the journalism class prioritizes, I'll use newspaper editorials. Searching both Nexis and Google News on ""editorial"" and ""sex trafficking act"" and ""Sinclair,"" here is what I found over the past couple of months:

* Sex Trafficking Act: 3 4* newspaper editorials, 2 of them in favor.

* Sinclair Broadcast: 15 newspaper editorials, 14 of them critical of Sinclair, 5 supporting federal government intervention, and exactly 1 criticizing Sinclair while telling the feds to back off.

Let's reward the good behavior first. Here is an Orange County Register editorial concluding that the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA) is ""well-meaning"" but ""wrong."" Sample:

FOSTA's penalties not only use the precautionary principle to justify a sweeping suppression of consensual communication, they also force private online companies like Craigslist to unwillingly shoehorn the precautionary principle into their business model. On top of these flaws, FOSTA commits one more sin. Now that websites face a one-strike-you're-out law on precautionary grounds, the door is open to more laws doing the same. In a free society, that's impermissible. FOSTA is a big mistake.

That's it! There's your one American newspaper* editorial criticizing a probably unconstitutional clampdown on free speech. By contrast, this Kansas City Star mastheader does not even mention that a free-speech objection exists, instead exulting in the ""bipartisan win"" and how ""this fight was worth it"":

Ever since the wildly lucrative world of sex trafficking moved from the streets to the internet, market leaders in commercial sex advertising like Backpage have hidden behind an antiquated section of the Communications Decency Act. The act provided Backpage with what [Sen. Claire] McCaskill called ""complete and total immunity from being held accountable for their bad behavior.""

As for the Sinclair dogpile, I previously pointed out the Boston Globe's remarkably shortsighted conclusion that political slant itself is one good reason for the federal government to block the company's expansion. But don't sleep on the St. Louis Post-Dispatch: ""In reality, the eerily Orwellian video, which quickly went viral, makes the case against the Sinclair-Tribune deal,"" the paper wrote. ""Trump told a verified average of 5.6 public lies per day in his first year in office. Yet Sinclair avoids questioning his veracity. Talk about dangerous for democracy."" Talk about non-hyperlinked assertions!

Sinclair is already ""too big"" (The Riverdale Press), its proposed merger is ""chilling to contemplate"" (Chicago Daily Herald) and downright ""dangerous"" (Modesto Bee), ""not just because it's anti-competitive but because it represents a danger to ethical broadcast journalism.""

Demonstrating an apparently rare ability to separate journalistic revulsion from a will to government power was the Richmond Times Dispatch, in an editorial headlined ""The Sinclair story just got worse, thanks to U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin."" Excerpt:

Sinclair's mistake was to turn a platitude into creepy Orwellian propaganda. But some things are worse than creepy Orwellian propaganda. Actual Orwellian behavior by government officials, for instance. The other day Sen. Dick Durbin sent a letter to Sinclair. ""I'm calling on Sinclair to explain itself,"" Durbin tweeted. Durbin is upset that Sinclair told Durbin's staff it doesn't dictate local content. In other words, Sinclair lied. (Members of Congress would never do such a thing themselves, right?) Durbin instructs Sinclair to ""clarify"" its policies concerning both content and personnel. Stop right there…. We're no fans of Sinclair's message or its methods. But principles of press freedom matter more than petty spats. So we hope Sinclair will tell Durbin to go jump in a lake. We'd be glad to give him directions.

That wasn't so hard, was it?

free_speech,Reason,2,https://reason.com/blog/2018/02/13/wired-magazine-thinks-free-speech-has-be,Wired Thinks Free Speech Has Been Tried and Failed,2018-02-13,"Brian Doherty, Scott Shackford, David Post, Josh Blackman, Shikha Dalmia, Jacob Sullum, Elizabeth Nolan Brown, Eric Boehm, Ilya Somin, Mike Riggs","John Perry Barlow famously declared that cyberspace , as we used to call it , was , should be , and must remain a realm of absolute intellectual freedom . It is a bitter irony that he died the same month that Wired , which for years celebrated the liberatory power of digital culture , features a terrible and terrifying cover feature deriding `` The Golden Age of Free Speech . ''
The package 's polemical point ? That free speech has failed us and deserves no particular further respect in this digital , social-networked world .
From the dark heart of their framing essay , Zeynep Tufekci 's `` It 's the ( Democracy-Poisoning ) Golden Age of Free Speech '' :
The most noble old ideas about free speech simply do n't compute in the age of social media . John Stuart Mill 's notion that a `` marketplace of ideas '' will elevate the truth is flatly belied by the virality of fake news . And the famous American saying that `` the best cure for bad speech is more speech '' —a paraphrase of Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis—loses all its meaning when speech is at once mass but also nonpublic . How do you respond to what you can not see ? How can you cure the effects of `` bad '' speech with more speech when you have no means to target the same audience that received the original message ?
Mill 's defenses of free expression are more complicated and subtle than the notion that a marketplace of ideas `` will elevate the truth . '' Mill argues as well in On Liberty that grappling with error is all that allows a human mind to remain intellectually active and acute , and that this is desirable in itself .
`` Truth gains more even by the errors of one who , with due study and preparation , thinks for himself , than by the true opinions of those who only hold them because they do not suffer themselves to think , '' Mill wrote . The search for truth has a value larger than merely getting people to believe what 's true .
The theory and philosophy of free expression should not be myopically focused on `` the truth . '' Plenty of expression—some might say the most important expression—are creative fictions that do not express facts about reality , empirical or moral . We must also defend tenaciously the ability to think and express even things we do not truly think and feel and believe , for the sake of exploration and play ( even though such expression can undoubtedly aggravate and anger people ) .
But even if you think ending up at the truth is all that matters—if you are willing to admit you believe truth spoken through broken teeth from the hobnailed boot of authority rings as sweetly as truth spoken through sincere belief earned through free investigation—Mill argued that your ability to grasp the truth of what you `` believe '' is weak indeed if never honed against the best arguments for opposite ideas . Humanity , he wrote , `` ought to have a rational assurance that all objections have been satisfactorily answered , and how are they to be answered if that which requires to be answered is not spoken ? '' ( Jonathan Rauch explained along Mill 's lines how gay acceptance and rights were in fact furthered by the fact that people are legally allowed to spew idiotic prejudices and false beliefs about homosexuality , in his classic 2013 Atlantic article `` The Case for Hate Speech . '' )
Tufekci doubts the value of free expression when one can not guarantee that those striving to counter falsehoods can reach `` the same audience that received the original message , '' a difficult or impossible task when that first communication was `` nonpublic . '' This is supposed to be a freshly sinister aspect of the digital age . Yet never in the history of the debate over free expression was any such guarantee possible . Nor was it ever thought necessary by people who supported ( or opposed ! ) free speech . Tufekci writes as if she is unfamiliar with , say , targeted political direct mail , which has long allowed partisans to gin up beliefs that the `` other side '' might not even have known existed , much less be able to counter tit-for-tat to the exact same audience .

Beyond that , Tufekci offers a series of complaints about speech in the modern era . First , that false claims and faked evidence can be distributed worldwide . ( She may be interested in some social science evidence downplaying the existential threat of `` fake news '' on the internet . ) Second , that such things , or anything , might be spread by Russian bots or alt-right trolls . Third , that any information someone spreads might not go as far or to the people they hoped it would thanks to perplexing or opaque social network algorithms .

''
`` Not to put too fine a point on it , '' Tufekci concludes , `` but all of this invalidates much of what we think about free speech—conceptually , legally and ethically . ''
freedom of speech is an important democratic value , but it 's not the only one . In the liberal tradition , free speech is usually understood as a vehicle—a necessary condition for achieving certain other societal ideals : for creating a knowledgeable public ; for engendering healthy , rational , and informed debate ; for holding powerful people and institutions accountable ; for keeping communities lively and vibrant . What we are seeing now is that when free speech is treated as an end and not a means , it is all too possible to thwart and distort everything it is supposed to deliver .
Is it true that free speech `` in the liberal tradition '' is merely a vehicle for greater goods , not a good in and of itself ? Not really . As well explicated in an essay by Alex Daniel , `` Speech Locked Up : John Locke , Liberalism , and the Regulation of Speech , '' Locke and many Lockeans ( such as those who thought a First Amendment to the Constitution was appropriate ) believed that `` speech was not simply a means to arrive at the truth , but rather it was an absolute right guaranteed to citizens by virtue of their status of autonomous , individual beings living in a free society . ''
Freedom , blessedly , helps many people live happy , wealthy , fulfilled lives . That is why many people of authoritarian temperament tolerate it . But that sort of `` objective '' betterment is not the sole ███ for liberty . An individual 's freedom to choose how to live , what to think , and how to express it is not contingent on a mass of others deciding they are happy with the outcome . It is a matter of an inherent right to be who you are , and to express it . Our culture is suffused with powerful works of art , from 1984 to A Clockwork Orange , that work from a core understanding that something vital and irreducible to our selves and our identities as intelligent human beings is attached to being able to think and express those things we think and feel and believe ; that it is a hideous evil to force someone to spout things they do n't believe , to suppress who they really are through their view of the world . As human beings , our thoughts and expressions are intimately and ineluctably woven with who we are ; squashing or banning or regulating them is as intimately invasive as one can be .
That said , Locke did more than merely huff and puff about rights . He strove as well for arguments that might convince even doubters that laws restricting expression were a bad idea . Notably , Locke argued against statutes barring `` religious insult '' on the grounds that , as the Oxford political scientist Teresa Bejan writes , `` laws against uncivil speech in and around religion were essentially counterproductive . ''
Locke 's argument in essence was , as Bejan put it , that `` restrictions on 'offensive ' speech encouraged an individual to act as judge in his own case concerning the degree or nature of the offense and then tempted him with the use of the civil sword in punishing the offender . A tolerant society in which different 'persuasions ' existed side by side would inevitably be home to many hot tempers , bruised egos , and hurt feelings . Legal limits on religious insult would be impossible to apply impartially and would necessarily invite abuse . '' ( In our secular age , add race/gender concerns to on-the-surface religious ones . )
Tufekci is n't worried about petty things like the human ability to be who we are , think what we think , and express it freely , to forge our identities and worldviews in freely chosen exchanges with fellow free and independent individuals . She 's got big tech business practices in her sight :
But we do n't have to be resigned to the status quo . Facebook is only 13 years old , Twitter 11 , and even Google is but 19 . At this moment in the evolution of the auto industry , there were still no seat belts , airbags , emission controls , or mandatory crumple zones . The rules and incentive structures underlying how attention and surveillance work on the internet need to change . But in fairness to Facebook and Google and Twitter , while there 's a lot they could do better , the public outcry demanding that they fix all these problems is fundamentally mistaken . There are few solutions to the problems of digital discourse that do n't involve huge trade-offs—and those are not choices for Mark Zuckerberg alone to make . These are deeply political decisions . In the 20th century , the US passed laws that outlawed lead in paint and gasoline , that defined how much privacy a landlord needs to give his tenants , and that determined how much a phone company can surveil its customers . We can decide how we want to handle digital surveillance , attention-­channeling , harassment , data collection , and algorithmic decision­making . We just need to start the discussion . Now .
The people to whom expression is clearly and always seen as most dangerous are dictators , who to this day from China to Venezuela to Russia try to lock people up for stating the wrong thing . No doubt Tufekci would insist that the sophistical Wired vision of how to manage the way people express themselves online will have nothing to do with squashing political dissent . But there is a ███ why the American tradition has paid at least lip service to `` no law . '' Once the principle is punctured , state power and state interests are quickest to fill the space .
The most casual gloss on the history of First Amendment litigation in America should make it obvious , especially for Trump- and GOP-haters , exactly how dangerous it is to casually toss aside the principle of legal protection for free speech .
Consider , for just a handful of examples , the Supreme Court cases Gitlow v. New York ( 1925 ) , involving a man arrested for publishing a revolutionary `` Left-Wing Manifesto '' ; Whitney v. California ( 1927 ) , involving a woman prosecuted for helping found a Communist Labor Party ; Stromberg v. California ( 1931 ) , involving prosecuting people for displaying a red flag ; and Near v. Minnesota ( 1931 ) , involving prosecution for issuing a newspaper the state decided was merely `` malicious , scandalous , and defamatory . ''
The above limn what letting slip the principle of `` no law '' tends to mean in practice : state power deciding what people can say , how they can use their symbols , how they can criticize the powers that be , and how they can organize to affect politics .
As Bejan points out , `` many academics and public intellectuals would rather rely on the inertia of strong institutional commitments to academic freedom , free expression , and civility while critiquing them into oblivion—only to complain , when we find ourselves hoist by our own petards . ''
It seems that the likes of Wired , though alarmed by a world of Russian bots and alt-right trolls ( which one imagines , though they do n't spell this out , that they blame for President Trump ) manages to perceive the worlds of media and expression as so ineluctably Theirs—their sensitive , progressive , smart , techno-elite but not beholden to Facebook selves—that they ca n't see the disconnect between `` let us manage expression through politics '' and `` expressive practices we do n't like have handed the government over to dangerous people . ''
The `` deeply political decisions '' Tufekci wants to control expression can and will be made by people who do not necessarily share Wired 's beliefs or sensitivities , and it is dangerous even on its own terms to call for making such decisions politically .
Wired 's editors are sadly not pathbreaking pioneers in this illiberalism . I noted the same phenomenon in a forthcoming book review in ███ 's April issue ( subscribe today ! ) . Noam Cohen , a New York Times reporter who covered the Silicon Valley scene for decades , presents as utterly uncontroversial in his new book The Know It Alls : The Rise of Silicon Valley as a Political Powerhouse and Social Wrecking Ball that one of the greatest sins of digital culture is it does not sufficiently squash speech he thinks deserves to be squashed .
That we must rapidly deploy the powers of state violence against people for saying certain things on the internet , or at least to stop them from saying them , is rapidly becoming conventional wisdom in certain circles , and not just stereotypical `` hysterical campus Marxist '' ones . What has been lost is any belief in inalienable human rights ( except , apparently , not to feel aggrieved or offended by things other people think and say or to see political outcomes shaped by the `` wrong '' information ) . That loss is real and serious .
As Katherine Mangu-Ward wrote in ███ 's January issue , an alarmingly large portion of American political culture would like to see the end of free speech . ███ has long noted this alarming trend toward annihilating free speech as a cultural and political imperative even in the West , from gay rights activists turning rapidly from heretics to heretic hunters , to respectable journalists scoffing at harmful `` speech nuts , '' to Canada acting on the belief that some attempts at persuasion need to be met with violence , to prominent American press kowtowing to violent threats from Islamists .
The Enlightenment skeptics are happy to remind you that John Milton , one of the founding thinkers of free expression in the West , did n't want to extend full political freedom to Catholics . That 's true , that 's regrettable , and that 's irrelevant to the stunning and life-saving sea change he helped generate in attitudes toward expression . The specific circumstances under which Milton did his thinking are quite relevant to Wired 's vague calls for restricting , in some unknown way , how people can use the `` publishing '' abilities of the internet .
As explained by Vincent Blasi in his essay `` Milton 's Areopagitica and the Modern First Amendment , '' the key that makes the highly religious Milton and his debate rooted in ecclesiastical pre-emptive censorship still relevant to this modern debate is he recognized more was at stake than just reaching the truth . `` The liberal case for free speech has suffered in recent years from misplaced emphasis , '' Blasi writes :
Contemporary critics have rightly punctured extravagant claims for expressive liberty made in the name of truth and democracy . Some of these critics , flushed with forensic success , have produced their own…schemes for regulating speech anew , this time on the side of the angels . The Areopagitica suggests , however , that one would have to `` sequester out '' of `` this world of evil '' to believe that the power to censor will ever be employed other than in a partial and vindictive spirit . It suggests also that political and social enervation—the collective weakening of aspiration , will , and taste for controversy—is the risk most to be feared from the regulation of speech . Those messages of Milton 's dated polemic remain timeless .
Pre-Enlightenment , post-Enlightenment , all too many people genuinely believe that it is only OK to say and think OK things , things that `` help democracy '' or do n't lead to `` bad outcomes . '' The nature of what 's OK changes ; the overarchingly illiberal attitude remains . Wired at least helps clarify the debate by stating outright that free speech is not a good in itself , but sometimes merely a means to a desired end .","John Perry Barlow famously declared that cyberspace, as we used to call it, was, should be, and must remain a realm of absolute intellectual freedom. It is a bitter irony that he died the same month that Wired, which for years celebrated the liberatory power of digital culture, features a terrible and terrifying cover feature deriding ""The Golden Age of Free Speech.""

The package's polemical point? That free speech has failed us and deserves no particular further respect in this digital, social-networked world.

From the dark heart of their framing essay, Zeynep Tufekci's ""It's the (Democracy-Poisoning) Golden Age of Free Speech"":

The most noble old ideas about free speech simply don't compute in the age of social media. John Stuart Mill's notion that a ""marketplace of ideas"" will elevate the truth is flatly belied by the virality of fake news. And the famous American saying that ""the best cure for bad speech is more speech""—a paraphrase of Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis—loses all its meaning when speech is at once mass but also nonpublic. How do you respond to what you cannot see? How can you cure the effects of ""bad"" speech with more speech when you have no means to target the same audience that received the original message?

Mill's defenses of free expression are more complicated and subtle than the notion that a marketplace of ideas ""will elevate the truth."" Mill argues as well in On Liberty that grappling with error is all that allows a human mind to remain intellectually active and acute, and that this is desirable in itself.

""Truth gains more even by the errors of one who, with due study and preparation, thinks for himself, than by the true opinions of those who only hold them because they do not suffer themselves to think,"" Mill wrote. The search for truth has a value larger than merely getting people to believe what's true.

The theory and philosophy of free expression should not be myopically focused on ""the truth."" Plenty of expression—some might say the most important expression—are creative fictions that do not express facts about reality, empirical or moral. We must also defend tenaciously the ability to think and express even things we do not truly think and feel and believe, for the sake of exploration and play (even though such expression can undoubtedly aggravate and anger people).

But even if you think ending up at the truth is all that matters—if you are willing to admit you believe truth spoken through broken teeth from the hobnailed boot of authority rings as sweetly as truth spoken through sincere belief earned through free investigation—Mill argued that your ability to grasp the truth of what you ""believe"" is weak indeed if never honed against the best arguments for opposite ideas. Humanity, he wrote, ""ought to have a rational assurance that all objections have been satisfactorily answered, and how are they to be answered if that which requires to be answered is not spoken?"" (Jonathan Rauch explained along Mill's lines how gay acceptance and rights were in fact furthered by the fact that people are legally allowed to spew idiotic prejudices and false beliefs about homosexuality, in his classic 2013 Atlantic article ""The Case for Hate Speech."")

Tufekci doubts the value of free expression when one cannot guarantee that those striving to counter falsehoods can reach ""the same audience that received the original message,"" a difficult or impossible task when that first communication was ""nonpublic."" This is supposed to be a freshly sinister aspect of the digital age. Yet never in the history of the debate over free expression was any such guarantee possible. Nor was it ever thought necessary by people who supported (or opposed!) free speech. Tufekci writes as if she is unfamiliar with, say, targeted political direct mail, which has long allowed partisans to gin up beliefs that the ""other side"" might not even have known existed, much less be able to counter tit-for-tat to the exact same audience. It's pure concern-trolling, holding up a phony ideal of free speech then regretfully concluding that since that can't be reached, any actual and real free speech isn't worth worrying about.

Beyond that, Tufekci offers a series of complaints about speech in the modern era. First, that false claims and faked evidence can be distributed worldwide. (She may be interested in some social science evidence downplaying the existential threat of ""fake news"" on the internet.) Second, that such things, or anything, might be spread by Russian bots or alt-right trolls. Third, that any information someone spreads might not go as far or to the people they hoped it would thanks to perplexing or opaque social network algorithms. Fourth, that speaking on the internet could lead trolls to harass you, either via computer messages or real-world pranking, including potentially fatal ""SWATting."" (Laws against actually harming people through things like SWATting need not impact speech as speech.) Fifth, that no larger authoritative body is marking what should be perceived as what, with everything just undifferentiated ""content.""

""Not to put too fine a point on it,"" Tufekci concludes, ""but all of this invalidates much of what we think about free speech—conceptually, legally and ethically.""

Only Good Speech is Good

For Tufekci,

freedom of speech is an important democratic value, but it's not the only one. In the liberal tradition, free speech is usually understood as a vehicle—a necessary condition for achieving certain other societal ideals: for creating a knowledgeable public; for engendering healthy, rational, and informed debate; for holding powerful people and institutions accountable; for keeping communities lively and vibrant. What we are seeing now is that when free speech is treated as an end and not a means, it is all too possible to thwart and distort everything it is supposed to deliver.

Is it true that free speech ""in the liberal tradition"" is merely a vehicle for greater goods, not a good in and of itself? Not really. As well explicated in an essay by Alex Daniel, ""Speech Locked Up: John Locke, Liberalism, and the Regulation of Speech,"" Locke and many Lockeans (such as those who thought a First Amendment to the Constitution was appropriate) believed that ""speech was not simply a means to arrive at the truth, but rather it was an absolute right guaranteed to citizens by virtue of their status of autonomous, individual beings living in a free society.""

Freedom, blessedly, helps many people live happy, wealthy, fulfilled lives. That is why many people of authoritarian temperament tolerate it. But that sort of ""objective"" betterment is not the sole reason for liberty. An individual's freedom to choose how to live, what to think, and how to express it is not contingent on a mass of others deciding they are happy with the outcome. It is a matter of an inherent right to be who you are, and to express it. Our culture is suffused with powerful works of art, from 1984 to A Clockwork Orange, that work from a core understanding that something vital and irreducible to our selves and our identities as intelligent human beings is attached to being able to think and express those things we think and feel and believe; that it is a hideous evil to force someone to spout things they don't believe, to suppress who they really are through their view of the world. As human beings, our thoughts and expressions are intimately and ineluctably woven with who we are; squashing or banning or regulating them is as intimately invasive as one can be.

That said, Locke did more than merely huff and puff about rights. He strove as well for arguments that might convince even doubters that laws restricting expression were a bad idea. Notably, Locke argued against statutes barring ""religious insult"" on the grounds that, as the Oxford political scientist Teresa Bejan writes, ""laws against uncivil speech in and around religion were essentially counterproductive.""

A tolerant society in which different 'persuasions' existed side by side would inevitably be home to many hot tempers, bruised egos, and hurt feelings. Legal limits on religious insult would be impossible to apply impartially and would necessarily invite abuse."" (In our secular age, add race/gender concerns to on-the-surface religious ones.)

Tufekci isn't worried about petty things like the human ability to be who we are, think what we think, and express it freely, to forge our identities and worldviews in freely chosen exchanges with fellow free and independent individuals. She's got big tech business practices in her sight:

But we don't have to be resigned to the status quo. Facebook is only 13 years old, Twitter 11, and even Google is but 19.

Speech Restrictions Are Always Tools of Power

The most casual gloss on the history of First Amendment litigation in America should make it obvious, especially for Trump- and GOP-haters, exactly how dangerous it is to casually toss aside the principle of legal protection for free speech.

Consider, for just a handful of examples, the Supreme Court cases Gitlow v. New York (1925), involving a man arrested for publishing a revolutionary ""Left-Wing Manifesto""; Whitney v. California (1927), involving a woman prosecuted for helping found a Communist Labor Party; Stromberg v. California (1931), involving prosecuting people for displaying a red flag; and Near v.

Dennis","Facebook Inc. told a Senate panel that it has detected “ only what appears to be insignificant overlap ” between targeting of ads and content promoted by a pro-Kremlin Russia group and by the presidential campaign of Donald Trump .
The social-media company said it “ does not believe it is in a position to substantiate or disprove allegations of possible collusion ” between Russia and the Trump campaign , as part of a written response to questions from the Senate Intelligence Committee released Thursday evening by the panel . Facebook didn ’ t go into further detail , saying it was willing to schedule a meeting with Senate staff to discuss the matter .
The remarks go beyond what the company told Congress during public hearings on Nov. 1 as part of probes into Russian election meddling . At that time , Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch said , “ We have not seen overlap in the targeting -- that was relatively rudimentary -- used in the advertising that was disclosed , and any other advertiser on the site , including the Trump campaign . ”
In responding to the Senate panel , Facebook , Twitter Inc. and Alphabet Inc. ’ s Google defended their efforts to combat malicious content on their networks and touted new disclosure efforts for election-related content that should be up and running for the 2018 midterm elections .
The company answers aren ’ t likely to quell concerns from lawmakers that the companies may not have found all of the abuse of its networks by Russians or taken enough steps to prevent future actions .
Facebook said it has no evidence that the Russian Internet Research Agency , which disseminated fake news and ads , targeted its efforts based on U.S. voter registration data .
Their targeting was “ relatively rudimentary , targeting broad locations and interests , ” the company said . Any revenue that Facebook made from ads run by the IRA was “ immaterial , ” it added , noting that it was contributing hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Defending Digital Democracy Project .
Facebook also said that the IRA organized 129 real-world events , viewed by approximately 338,300 people , with 62,500 people saying they were planning to attend . Facebook said that in some cases , its algorithm did automatically recommend that people view , follow or join Russian-linked pages , because the company wasn ’ t aware that they were not legitimate .
Twitter and Google didn ’ t address the possibility of overlap between the Russian-backed IRA and the Trump campaign in their latest answers .
But Twitter did say it wasn ’ t aware of `` any specific state-sponsored attempts to interfere in any American elections in 2017 , including the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial elections . ''

Facebook Inc. told a Senate panel that it has detected “only what appears to be insignificant overlap” between targeting of ads and content promoted by a pro-Kremlin Russia group and by the presidential campaign of Donald Trump.

The social-media company said it “does not believe it is in a position to substantiate or disprove allegations of possible collusion” between Russia and the Trump campaign, as part of a written response to questions from the Senate Intelligence Committee released Thursday evening by the panel. Facebook didn’t go into further detail, saying it was willing to schedule a meeting with Senate staff to discuss the matter.

The remarks go beyond what the company told Congress during public hearings on Nov. 1 as part of probes into Russian election meddling. At that time, Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch said, “We have not seen overlap in the targeting -- that was relatively rudimentary -- used in the advertising that was disclosed, and any other advertiser on the site, including the Trump campaign.”

In responding to the Senate panel, Facebook, Twitter Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google defended their efforts to combat malicious content on their networks and touted new disclosure efforts for election-related content that should be up and running for the 2018 midterm elections.

The company answers aren’t likely to quell concerns from lawmakers that the companies may not have found all of the abuse of its networks by Russians or taken enough steps to prevent future actions.

Facebook said it has no evidence that the Russian Internet Research Agency, which disseminated fake news and ads, targeted its efforts based on U.S. voter registration data.

Their targeting was “relatively rudimentary, targeting broad locations and interests,” the company said. Any revenue that Facebook made from ads run by the IRA was “immaterial,” it added, noting that it was contributing hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Defending Digital Democracy Project.

Facebook also said that the IRA organized 129 real-world events, viewed by approximately 338,300 people, with 62,500 people saying they were planning to attend. Facebook said that in some cases, its algorithm did automatically recommend that people view, follow or join Russian-linked pages, because the company wasn’t aware that they were not legitimate.

Twitter and Google didn’t address the possibility of overlap between the Russian-backed IRA and the Trump campaign in their latest answers.

But Twitter did say it wasn’t aware of ""any specific state-sponsored attempts to interfere in any American elections in 2017, including the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial elections.""

Twitter said it was unable to monitor every tweet posted in relation to real-time events, but that it dedicated nearly the entire engineering, product and design teams to address malicious automation, bots and other coordinated activities in the beginning of 2017. Its automated systems are supplemented by internal, manual reviews conducted by Twitter employees, the company said.

""We are committed to addressing the spread of misinformation on our platform — and to prevent future attempts to interfere with U.S. elections — but we recognize that spam and malicious automation are not limited to political content and can undermine the positive user experience we seek to offer irrespective of the content,"" the company said.

Google told Senate investigators it is working on ""greater transparency"" for news in its search results, including labeling sources that receive funding from governments. RT and Sputnik, prominent publishers backed by the Russian government, are now labeled in search, the company said. Google also said it’s planning to apply the same disclosures on YouTube, its massive video site, although it didn’t offer specifics.

Facebook said it has no problem with RT and Sputnik maintaining pages on Facebook and using its advertising tools, as long as they comply with the company’s policies and local laws.

Facebook was also asked how much news content on its site was ""hyper-partisan.""

“Defining what is hyper-partisan is difficult and controversial, and we do not have an estimate,” the company said. “We have not conducted any formal studies on how such content spreads on the platform.”

In response to a question from Republican Senator Tom Cotton, Twitter defended hosting accounts from Wikileaks and its founder Julian Assange, as well as former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who stole and released a trove of highly classified data.

""Consistent with our values and commitment to fostering an open exchange of ideas, unless the activity or posted content violates our Terms of Service or Twitter Rules, we do not bar controversial figures from our platform or prohibit accounts from posting controversial content,” the company said.

In response to another question, Google and Twitter said they don’t use products made by Kaspersky Lab, a security-software maker that has been working with Russian intelligence. Facebook said that in October it stopped offering Kaspersky anti-virus software to users when its systems detect they may have malware, but said it still uses a Kaspersky product that provides the company with information about threat activity.

Members of the One Free Press Coalition will publish on their platforms each month a `` 10 Most Urgent '' list of journalists who have been jailed , threatened or attacked for their work .
The group 's mission is to use the voices of its members to `` stand up for journalists under attack for pursuing the truth , '' the organization said .
Among the first group of journalists the coalition is spotlighting are the late Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi , who was killed in October 2018 by Saudi agents at the country 's consulate in Istanbul , and Maria Ressa , the founder of the news site Rappler who has faced arrest and legal threats in the Philippines .
AP Executive Editor Sally Buzbee praised the effort as a way to bring attention to `` the vital cause of reporting without harassment or threat . ''
`` Journalism is under attack around the world , '' Buzbee said . `` We believe journalists must be permitted to pursue facts fearlessly for the greater good of society and democracy , and we are happy that the One Free Press Coalition will join us in that fight . ''
Other coalition members include EURACTIV , Forbes , HuffPost , Le Temps , Sueddeutsche Zeitung , Time , Wired , and Yahoo News .
The importance of a free press is seen daily around the world , especially in countries ruled by authoritarian regimes , said Wolfgang Krach , Sueddeutsche Zeitung editor-in-chief .
`` Intimidation , violence , incendiary speech against journalists and preventing reporters from doing their jobs are crucial issues for our profession in these times , '' Mr. Krach said .
The group 's reach , including online and on social media , will allow it to signal its solidarity for journalism colleagues and simultaneously tell those who threaten free speech that they are being watched , said Randall Lane , Forbes ' chief content officer who championed the concept of the coalition at a meeting of the International Media Council at the World Economic Forum .
`` With the One Free Press Coalition , we are shining an enduring light from all corners of the globe on our fellow journalists who are being persecuted , punished or worse in the pursuit of truth , '' Mr. Lane said .
Other coalition partners include the Committee to Protect Journalists and the International Women 's Media Foundation .

• Tran Thi Nga , a Vietnamese human rights blogger who has been sentenced on charges of `` spreading propaganda . ''","A coalition of more than a dozen global news organizations, including The Associated Press, The Financial Times and Reuters, will spotlight the world's most threatened journalists in a new freedom of speech initiative, the group announced Friday in New York.

Members of the One Free Press Coalition will publish on their platforms each month a ""10 Most Urgent"" list of journalists who have been jailed, threatened or attacked for their work.

The group's mission is to use the voices of its members to ""stand up for journalists under attack for pursuing the truth,"" the organization said.

Among the first group of journalists the coalition is spotlighting are the late Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed in October 2018 by Saudi agents at the country's consulate in Istanbul, and Maria Ressa, the founder of the news site Rappler who has faced arrest and legal threats in the Philippines.

AP Executive Editor Sally Buzbee praised the effort as a way to bring attention to ""the vital cause of reporting without harassment or threat.""

""Journalism is under attack around the world,"" Buzbee said. ""We believe journalists must be permitted to pursue facts fearlessly for the greater good of society and democracy, and we are happy that the One Free Press Coalition will join us in that fight.""

Other coalition members include EURACTIV, Forbes, HuffPost, Le Temps, Sueddeutsche Zeitung, Time, Wired, and Yahoo News.

The importance of a free press is seen daily around the world, especially in countries ruled by authoritarian regimes, said Wolfgang Krach, Sueddeutsche Zeitung editor-in-chief.

""Intimidation, violence, incendiary speech against journalists and preventing reporters from doing their jobs are crucial issues for our profession in these times,"" Mr. Krach said.

The group's reach, including online and on social media, will allow it to signal its solidarity for journalism colleagues and simultaneously tell those who threaten free speech that they are being watched, said Randall Lane, Forbes' chief content officer who championed the concept of the coalition at a meeting of the International Media Council at the World Economic Forum.

""With the One Free Press Coalition, we are shining an enduring light from all corners of the globe on our fellow journalists who are being persecuted, punished or worse in the pursuit of truth,"" Mr. Lane said.

Other coalition partners include the Committee to Protect Journalists and the International Women's Media Foundation.

The other journalists whose stories are being highlighted Friday are:

Williamson, Jonah Goldberg, Yuval Levin, Nro Contributor","Leftists love Johnnie Reb in movies and songs . But statues ? Not so much .
How exactly did the Left romanticize the Lost Cause Confederacy , and by extension its secession and efforts to preserve slavery ?
Well before the end of Jim Crow , post-war leftist Hollywood still largely continued its soft mythologies of the Confederate Lost Cause . Perhaps the cinematic romance arose because of the lucrative fumes of earlier Gone with the Wind fantasies , which themselves might ’ ve come from an understandable desire to play a part in “ binding up the nation ’ s wounds . ”
In George Stevens ’ s mythic Shane ( 1953 ) , the tragedy of the post–Civil War heroic gunslinger seems eerily tied to his past as an against-the-odds ex-Reb . In contrast , the movie ’ s odious villain , Unionist Jack Wilson , is a hired gun and company man ( brilliantly portrayed by then newcomer Jack Palance ) .
Wilson shows off his bought cred by gunning down a naïve southern sodbuster , “ Stonewall ” Torrey ( played by Elisha Cook Jr. ) , accompanied by slurs about the Confederacy . ( “ I ’ m saying that Stonewall Jackson was trash himself . Him and Lee and all the rest of them Rebs . You too . ” )
In the movie ’ s final shootout , replaying the Civil War provides the catalyst for more violence . This time Shane — and the heroic South — wins for good , with a payback Civil War exchange with Wilson :
Shane : I ’ ve heard about you , Jack Wilson . Wilson : What have you heard , Shane ? Shane : I ’ ve heard that you ’ re a low-down Yankee liar . Wilson : Prove it .
Wilson is then blown back across the barroom under a hail of bullets . Even out on the Wyoming range , the Hollywood subtext is that sodbuster homesteaders can find a former Confederate loser to protect them , with courage and chivalry , against the northern corporatists trying to steamroll them . The noble savior Shane , we are assumed to believe , had no part in slavery or insurrection but was fighting for his southern soil in service to the Confederacy .
Part of the dark mystery and tragedy of John Ford ’ s anti-hero Ethan Edwards in The Searchers originates in Edwards ’ s edgy Lost Cause mettle — and acts of bravery that never seem to result in his own positive outcome . His prior stint with the Confederacy is alluded to not just to remind the audience of his unrepentant side but also to emphasize the origins of Edwards ’ s formidable skills , doggedness , and principles — especially valuable in times ( and only during such times ) when frontier law fails and such assets are necessary , even if acquired in nihilist service to the losing side .
John Ford drew on that Confederate romance of noble opponents in several films , from Stagecoach ( 1939 ) to The Horse Soldiers ( 1959 ) . A common theme is audacity fueled by admirable past loyalty to a bad cause , a key ingredient in classic portraits of the tragic hero from Homer to Erwin Rommel .
Hollywood Westerns — often in the 1950s and early 1960s — increasingly saw in the Confederate romance a way of reuniting the country , and they partook of the leftist pushback against a federal establishment . Indeed , it is hard to watch a Western in which a southern officer is portrayed purely negatively . At worst , they are daydreamers plotting to rebuild a western confederacy ( Rio Conchos ) . At best , they play into the stereotypes that the better fighters of the South lost the war only because of overwhelming industrial output and manpower of the North — and thus former Confederates are especially valuable Indian fighters on the frontier , a safe space for them that is the United States but not the North .
The True Grit movies have a larger-than-life Rooster Cogburn character , an anti-hero and former member of the Quantrill Raiders , the pro-Confederate rangers ’ gang that included Jesse and Frank James . John Wayne first portrayed Cogburn in 1969 , in a finale to his earlier southern roles in John Ford ’ s cavalry movies .
In 1969 ’ s The Good , The Bad and The Ugly , Clint Eastwood mastered the art of portraying Confederates as noble opponents , especially in a haunting scene of an oppressive Union POW camp overseen by a psychopathic criminal commandant , set to the moving lyrics of Ennio Morricone ’ s “ Story of a Soldier . ”
Eastwood later went the full Confederate , in The Outlaw Josey Wales ( 1976 ) . The former son of the South , Wales becomes a 1970s cowboy version of Dirty Harry , serving as a jack-of-all-trades multiculturalist equalizer — fighting back against vicious northern red-leg marauders and in behalf of abandoned women , the poor , and Native Americans .
The supposedly left-wing 1960s and 1970s , in fact , were the heyday of Confederate Chic .

Leftists love Johnnie Reb in movies and songs. But statues? Not so much.

How exactly did the Left romanticize the Lost Cause Confederacy, and by extension its secession and efforts to preserve slavery?

To use a shopworn phrase, “It’s complicated.”

Good Ol’ Rebels

Well before the end of Jim Crow, post-war leftist Hollywood still largely continued its soft mythologies of the Confederate Lost Cause. Perhaps the cinematic romance arose because of the lucrative fumes of earlier Gone with the Wind fantasies, which themselves might’ve come from an understandable desire to play a part in “binding up the nation’s wounds.”

In George Stevens’s mythic Shane (1953), the tragedy of the post–Civil War heroic gunslinger seems eerily tied to his past as an against-the-odds ex-Reb. In contrast, the movie’s odious villain, Unionist Jack Wilson, is a hired gun and company man (brilliantly portrayed by then newcomer Jack Palance).

Wilson shows off his bought cred by gunning down a naïve southern sodbuster, “Stonewall” Torrey (played by Elisha Cook Jr.), accompanied by slurs about the Confederacy. (“I’m saying that Stonewall Jackson was trash himself. Him and Lee and all the rest of them Rebs. You too.”)

In the movie’s final shootout, replaying the Civil War provides the catalyst for more violence. This time Shane — and the heroic South — wins for good, with a payback Civil War exchange with Wilson:

Shane: I’ve heard about you, Jack Wilson. Wilson: What have you heard, Shane? Shane: I’ve heard that you’re a low-down Yankee liar. Wilson: Prove it.

Wilson is then blown back across the barroom under a hail of bullets. Even out on the Wyoming range, the Hollywood subtext is that sodbuster homesteaders can find a former Confederate loser to protect them, with courage and chivalry, against the northern corporatists trying to steamroll them. The noble savior Shane, we are assumed to believe, had no part in slavery or insurrection but was fighting for his southern soil in service to the Confederacy.

Part of the dark mystery and tragedy of John Ford’s anti-hero Ethan Edwards in The Searchers originates in Edwards’s edgy Lost Cause mettle — and acts of bravery that never seem to result in his own positive outcome. His prior stint with the Confederacy is alluded to not just to remind the audience of his unrepentant side but also to emphasize the origins of Edwards’s formidable skills, doggedness, and principles — especially valuable in times (and only during such times) when frontier law fails and such assets are necessary, even if acquired in nihilist service to the losing side.

John Ford drew on that Confederate romance of noble opponents in several films, from Stagecoach (1939) to The Horse Soldiers (1959). A common theme is audacity fueled by admirable past loyalty to a bad cause, a key ingredient in classic portraits of the tragic hero from Homer to Erwin Rommel.

Hollywood Westerns — often in the 1950s and early 1960s — increasingly saw in the Confederate romance a way of reuniting the country, and they partook of the leftist pushback against a federal establishment. Indeed, it is hard to watch a Western in which a southern officer is portrayed purely negatively. At worst, they are daydreamers plotting to rebuild a western confederacy (Rio Conchos). At best, they play into the stereotypes that the better fighters of the South lost the war only because of overwhelming industrial output and manpower of the North — and thus former Confederates are especially valuable Indian fighters on the frontier, a safe space for them that is the United States but not the North.

The True Grit movies have a larger-than-life Rooster Cogburn character, an anti-hero and former member of the Quantrill Raiders, the pro-Confederate rangers’ gang that included Jesse and Frank James. John Wayne first portrayed Cogburn in 1969, in a finale to his earlier southern roles in John Ford’s cavalry movies.

In 1969’s The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, Clint Eastwood mastered the art of portraying Confederates as noble opponents, especially in a haunting scene of an oppressive Union POW camp overseen by a psychopathic criminal commandant, set to the moving lyrics of Ennio Morricone’s “Story of a Soldier.”

Eastwood later went the full Confederate, in The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976). The former son of the South, Wales becomes a 1970s cowboy version of Dirty Harry, serving as a jack-of-all-trades multiculturalist equalizer — fighting back against vicious northern red-leg marauders and in behalf of abandoned women, the poor, and Native Americans.

The supposedly left-wing 1960s and 1970s, in fact, were the heyday of Confederate Chic. True, there were plenty of In the Heat of the Night portraits of the now-familiar racist white Neanderthals, but with the passage of the Voting Rights Act and the end of Jim Crow segregation, the romance of the Old South reappeared, updated and tweaked for the era of counterculture protest.

The hippie style of long hair, beards and mustaches, resistance to government authority, twangy folk-song strains, and hard-edged metal all fed into the rural, down-home Confederate romance.

In Walter Hill’s post-Vietnam The Long Riders (1980), the murderous Jesse James gang morphs into a sort of mix of Lynyrd Skynyrd with Bonnie and Clyde — noble outlaws fighting the grasping northern banks and the railroad companies’ “Pinkerton Men.” David Carradine and his siblings, playing members of the gang, appear like Woodstock rockers, with exaggerated southern accents, long unkempt hair, hippie buckskin, and a don’t-give-a-damn Bay Area resistance attitude.

When a clueless Unionist musician is caught in a cathouse playing “The Battle Cry of Freedom” (“Rally Round the Flag, boys”), a Younger brother (Randy Quaid) in the gang forces him to substitute “I’m a Good Old Rebel,” sung by no less than California hipster Ry Cooder. The lyrics are unabashedly treasonous:

I hate the Yankee nation And everything they do. I hates the Declaration of Independence too. I hates the glorious Union ’Tis dripping with our blood. And I hates their striped banner. I fought it all I could.

Hipster Confederates

An earlier melodic and hit rendition of Robbie Robertson’s (of The Band) “The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,” sung by civil-rights activist Joan Baez, helped resurrect and mainstream Baez’s folk career. But Robertson’s song is about the Union’s slashing and burning its way through the sacred ground of the empathetic and slave-owning South — it’s an unapologetic and romantic defense of Confederate rebellion:

Like my father before me, I will work the land And like my brother above me, who took a Rebel stand. He was just 18, proud and brave, but a Yankee laid him in his grave. I swear by the mud below my feet, You can’t raise a Caine back up when he’s in defeat. The night they drove old Dixie down, and the bells were ringing The night they drove old Dixie down, and all the people were singing They went, “Na, la, na, la, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.”

The unlikely common denominator that brought together left-wing Sixties popular culture with Confederate cool was a mutual hatred of a supposedly big, square, soulless, and powerful Washington, hated for its insolence in Vietnam and for stifling the individual — as if the poor lost South had been once as defenseless as the Vietnamese in the face of such a godless steamroller, or as if the Carradine clan were like the Allman Brothers with six-shooters.

Were rockers from the South popular versions of the 1920s and ’30s Southern Agrarians (“I’ll take my stand”) critics?

Few pop icons (but see Neil Young’s “Southern Man”) dared in the 1980s to suggest that southern chic was somehow blind to the racism of the Confederacy rather than just defiant and anti-government.

Ummm… Thanks for that , Twitter . I 'd hate to think that I 'm paying attention to the `` wrong '' people .
But maybe I 'm also not paying attention to the right people—as decided by the powers-that-be .
`` We work with respected organizations… to empower credible non-governmental voices against violent extremism , '' Twitter 's Carlos Monje Jr. , director of public policy and philanthropy in the U.S. and Canada , told the Senate Committee on Commerce , Science , and Transportation last week .
`` Over the past three years , we have commissioned research on what types of counterspeech are the most effective at combating hate and violent extremism , '' Monika Bickert , Facebook 's head of global policy management , assured senators at the same hearing . `` We have therefore partnered with non-governmental organizations and community groups around the world to empower positive and moderate voices .

YouTube 's Juniper Downs , Director Public Policy and Government Relations , also promised lawmakers that her company was quarantining what she termed `` borderline content '' to achieve `` a substantial reduction in watch time of those videos . '' YouTube is also actively producing `` counterspeech , '' Downs testified . `` We are expanding our counter-extremism work to present counternarratives and elevate the voices that are most credible in speaking out against terrorism , hate , and violence . ''
To be sure , working against violent extremism sounds , on its face , like a good thing . But let 's be clear that these are executives of media companies going before government officials to promise to suppress officially disapproved speech and to promote ideas and messages that the government supports . Historically , the sort of `` hate speech '' government officials tend to dislike most is that directed at them , and their definitions of `` positive and moderate voices '' most commonly apply to anything that strokes their egos .
Need an example ? Let 's peek at our friends across the Atlantic . Unhampered by strong protections for free speech , they 're openly most concerned when the targets are themselves .
`` In recent years , the intimidation experienced by Parliamentary candidates , and others in public life , has become a threat to the diversity , integrity , and vibrancy of representative democracy in the UK , '' fretted the UK government 's Committee on Standards in Public Life in a report published last month . `` Intimidatory behaviour is already affecting the way in which MPs are relating to their constituents , has put off candidates who want to serve their communities from standing for public offices , and threatens to damage the vibrancy and diversity of our public life .

`` We propose legislative changes that the government should bring forward on social media companies ' liability for illegal content online , and an electoral offence of intimidating Parliamentary candidates and party campaigners . ''

`` Thousands of propaganda accounts on social networks are spreading all over the world , in all languages , lies invented to tarnish political officials , personalities , public figures , journalists , '' Macron complained earlier this month .
Macron also has Russkies on the mind . He bitterly complained during his successful presidential campaign last year that Moscow had targeted him with `` fake news '' that did nothing to prevent his victory , but left him very annoyed indeed .
Or maybe blaming `` les Russes '' is just a handy way of pushing through laws that would , among other things , empower judges to suppress any content these government officials deemed to be `` fake '' during election periods . Government regulators would also gain more power to `` fight any destabilization attempt '' via television content .
`` The first question is : What is fake news ? Who will define it ? '' asked Daniel Schneidermann , a media columnist for the French newspaper Libération , in just the sort of destabilizing comment tending to tarnish political officials that gets Macron 's goat .
Germans could answer that question , based on the laws they already have on the books . Government officials will define it , of course , and they wo n't be shy about doing so .
When Beatrix von Storch , a lawmaker from the Alliance for Germany party , greeted the new year with a dyspeptic anti-Muslim tweet , Twitter promptly suspended her account , followed by Facebook , after she reposted her comments there . The social media companies acted under threat of 50 million euro fines under the country 's new censorship law , which requires media companies to delete `` hate speech '' without defining the term .
Next to be suppressed was Titanic , a satire magazine which poked fun at von Storch .
`` Why are [ North-Rhine-Westphalia ] police using Arabic numbers for their emergency hotline ? '' the magazine asked , in a tweet purporting to be from the lawmaker .
Of course Titanic was suspended . They tweaked a legislator in a country that bans hate speech , and it 's clear from the examples of Britain and France that the speech politicians hate most is that directed at them .
Yeah , it 's `` creepy '' when media companies mold and twist the news we see to please their political masters . Worse , it 's chilling when governments take the logical next step to promote speech they favor and punish speakers who anger them .
Because when politicians tell us that they 're trying to make the world a better place with censorship , that 's the fakest news of all . But here 's a bit of real news : when government officials suppress critics , they do so only to help themselves .","The folks from the government are here to protect us from extremism, fake news, and hate speech, and they've strong-armed some media company friends to help.

Germans could answer that question, based on the laws they already have on the books. Government officials will define it, of course, and they won't be shy about doing so.

When Beatrix von Storch, a lawmaker from the Alliance for Germany party, greeted the new year with a dyspeptic anti-Muslim tweet, Twitter promptly suspended her account, followed by Facebook, after she reposted her comments there. The social media companies acted under threat of 50 million euro fines under the country's new censorship law, which requires media companies to delete ""hate speech"" without defining the term.

Next to be suppressed was Titanic, a satire magazine which poked fun at von Storch.

""Why are [North-Rhine-Westphalia] police using Arabic numbers for their emergency hotline?"" the magazine asked, in a tweet purporting to be from the lawmaker.

Of course Titanic was suspended. They tweaked a legislator in a country that bans hate speech, and it's clear from the examples of Britain and France that the speech politicians hate most is that directed at them.

Yeah, it's ""creepy"" when media companies mold and twist the news we see to please their political masters. Worse, it's chilling when governments take the logical next step to promote speech they favor and punish speakers who anger them.

Because when politicians tell us that they're trying to make the world a better place with censorship, that's the fakest news of all. But here's a bit of real news: when government officials suppress critics, they do so only to help themselves.",www.reason.com,right,Azbn5IqQ6mowh13b

It’s not the Left, despite what some leftists seem to think.

Sloppy thinking usually isn’t a criminal offense. Then again, Sarah Jones at the New Republic has written an essay called “How Donald Trump Poisons Free Speech.” Jones, the magazine’s social-media editor, asks the empirical question, “Is it ever possible to define, and then fairly restrict, dangerous speech?” She winds up answering a different, normative one: “Free speech isn’t a pure and abstract good,” Jones says, and “no law, even when it is enshrined in the Constitution, can alone justify an absolute position on free speech.” If Jones, a leftist (don’t call her a liberal!), had stuck to answering the question she asked, she might have arrived at a different conclusion. For the very same “absolutism” that Jones thinks should be abandoned is what stops government officials such as Donald Trump from declaring ideas such as hers to be dangerous and throwing their exponents in jail.

But I don’t need to tell her that. No leftist can forget Schenck v. United States or the American public’s sundry red scares, and Jones is apparently intimately familiar with the history: To support her proposition that free-speech “absolutism” needs to be “re-examined,” Jones borrows logic from the Supreme Court’s opinion in Schenck. In short, the political climate is what it is, and white-supremacist ideas are what they are; consequently, the expression of those ideas carries a clear and present danger of criminal activity. Where Oliver Wendell Holmes said in Schenck that “the character of every act depends upon the circumstances in which it is done,” Jones puts her own riff on it: Free speech, “like all civil liberties, is shaped by the context in which it occurs.”

White-supremacist terrorism sometimes follows white-supremacist demonstrations, and Jones draws a straight line between the speech and the violence. For one, the alt-right is “radicalizing whites online.” They also tend to to carry guns. There’s even evidence that “rhetoric that dehumanizes and stigmatizes” causes hate crimes. All of this, Jones says, means that “speech can harm” when it comes from Nazis. The recent decision by the ACLU not to represent armed protestors, the apparent occasion for her piece, is a logical consequence of that argument.

It’s clear that Jones is sympathetic to the ACLU’s newfound reticence to defend two rights at once. She’s also sympathetic to its critics, who contend that the organization’s still-expansive reading of the First Amendment needs a revision. And while the activity of legal advocacy groups has consequences for policy and the law — consider the ACLU’s history — Jones is circumspect about what exactly those should be.

That’s ultimately to the detriment of her fellow comrades on the left. An alternative reading of the First Amendment, one in which speech only deserves protection if it accords with a holistic picture of who is and isn’t marginalized, would be ripe for abuse precisely because of today’s political climate. Sure, the front of white nationalism continues to advance, which Jones says “chills free speech for those on the left.” But a more direct way to squash free speech for those on the left would be for free-speech absolutists to listen to Sarah Jones.

The new rules come as Google faces increasing scrutiny from politicians , the public , and its employees on a number of issues . Republicans , including President Donald Trump , continue to make unfounded accusations that the company ’ s products display a bias against conservatives . Employees on both sides of the political aisle have accused Google of retaliating against workers on the basis of their ethical and political beliefs . And internal debates over controversial projects , like a censored search engine for China , and company decisions , like how to moderate abusive content on YouTube , have created a growing rift between employees and leadership .
In an email sent to employees Thursday evening , Google CEO Sundar Pichai explained the company ’ s revised community guidelines , which now explicitly discourage workers from discussing politics on Google ’ s thousands of internal mailing lists and forums , several of which are devoted exclusively to discussing politics and related topics .
“ While sharing information and ideas with colleagues helps build community , disrupting the workday to have a raging debate over politics or the latest news story does not , ” the guidelines state . They warn employees that their primary responsibility is to “ do the work ” that they ’ ve been hired to do — “ not to spend working time on debates about non-work topics . ”
The new rules are a radical departure from how the historically open company has always functioned , and they demonstrate how seriously Google is confronting its ongoing struggle with internal dissent among its rank and file and external accusations of political bias .
Google has long been known for allowing and even encouraging employees to debate and organize around controversial topics , including its product launches and national politics . That ’ s caused problems for the company , particularly as it ’ s scaled in size in an increasingly polarized political climate .
Shortly after President Trump was elected in 2016 , Google co-founder Sergey Brin said in an all-hands company meeting that he found the election “ deeply offensive ” as “ an immigrant and a refugee. ” He remarked that “ many people apparently don ’ t share the values that we have. ” Almost two years later , Breitbart News leaked video of that meeting , fueling conservative claims ( including from President Trump himself ) that the company is biased against Republicans .
Under the new policies , Google employees will be prevented from making statements that “ insult , demean , or humiliate ” the company ’ s employees , business partners , or “ others ” — including public figures . A Google spokesperson confirmed to Recode that those public figures would include elected officials such as Trump .
Employees won ’ t be allowed to engage in heated political debates that , for example , encourage or organize employees to vote for or against a specific candidate .
The company will also create enforcement mechanisms to police and discipline employees who don ’ t follow the new guidelines — including a “ central flagging tool ” where employees can report each other ’ s comments as inappropriate . A new team of internal community managers will then review these posts and help determine if they violate Google ’ s community standards . If they do , employees involved with the posts could face disciplinary action .
A spokesperson for the company said that in most cases , the company would first try to educate employees before disciplining them . Part of the community managers ’ jobs will also be to work with moderators of internal listservs to help make sure those messages are following the new guidelines .
Google first introduced internal community guidelines to regulate discussion on its many internal forums and email lists last year . While some employees appreciated the guidelines and saw them as an attempt to limit harassment between colleagues , others criticized the move for forcing Google employees to respect uncivil speech from their colleagues on the basis of respecting all sides .
These new guidelines are similarly likely to raise concern with employees , particularly that they could stifle workers ’ ability to speak out against Google ’ s own policies and practices . Last November , in what ’ s considered one of the largest moments of worker activism in the tech industry , 20,000 Google employees walked out of their offices to protest news that the company paid millions in buyout packages to executives who were accused of sexual harassment . And when employees raised concerns over controversial initiatives — such as Project Maven , Google ’ s plans to use its artificial intelligence to enhance US military drones , and Project Dragonfly , its efforts to build a censored search engine in China — Google eventually halted both projects .
The new guidelines state that employees “ are all free to raise concerns and respectfully question and debate the company ’ s activities , ” and that it ’ s “ part of [ Google ’ s ] culture. ” But at the same time , they warn employees that they ’ re forbidden from accessing or sharing “ need-to-know ” information or making “ false or misleading statements about Google ’ s products or business. ” Such guidelines reinforce the limitations on employees who engage in what they view as whistleblowing activity . ( Projects like Maven and Dragonfly were not widely known within or outside the company until employees made them public . )
Reining in Google ’ s unique workplace culture is a leviathan task that no single set of community rules could accomplish all on its own . But the company ’ s new restrictions show Google knows it can ’ t simply dismiss the political controversies surrounding its workplace and products . The world , and politics , have changed since Google was founded 21 years ago . It seems Google decided it was time to change , too .
Community guidelines exist to support the healthy and open discussion that has always been a part of our culture . They help create an environment where we can come together as a community in pursuit of our shared mission and serve our users . Working at Google comes with tremendous responsibility . Billions of people rely on us every day for high-quality , reliable information . It ’ s critical that we honor that trust and uphold the integrity of our products and services .

Here are Google’s revised community guidelines in full:

Community guidelines exist to support the healthy and open discussion that has always been a part of our culture. They help create an environment where we can come together as a community in pursuit of our shared mission and serve our users. Working at Google comes with tremendous responsibility. Billions of people rely on us every day for high-quality, reliable information. It’s critical that we honor that trust and uphold the integrity of our products and services. The following guidelines are official policy and apply when you’re communicating in the workplace.

Here are some key things to remember as you communicate:

Be responsible. What you say and do matters. You’re responsible for your words and actions and you’ll be held accountable for them.

What you say and do matters. You’re responsible for your words and actions and you’ll be held accountable for them. Be helpful. Your voice is your contribution — make it productive.

Your voice is your contribution — make it productive. Be thoughtful. Your statements can be attributed to Google regardless of your intent, and you should be thoughtful about making statements that could cause others to make incorrect assumptions.

1. When communicating, follow the three Google Values.

Respect the user, respect the opportunity, respect each other. Our Values govern how we conduct ourselves in the pursuit of our mission. We each need to own them personally; we all need to own them collectively.

2. Do your part to keep Google a safe, productive, and inclusive environment for everyone.

While sharing information and ideas with colleagues helps build community, disrupting the workday to have a raging debate over politics or the latest news story does not. Our primary responsibility is to do the work we’ve each been hired to do, not to spend working time on debates about non-work topics.

Avoid conversations that are disruptive to the workplace or otherwise violate Google’s workplace policies. Managers are expected to address discussions that violate those rules.

3. Discussions that make other Googlers feel like they don’t belong have no place here.

Don’t troll, name call, or engage in ad hominem attacks — about anyone. This includes making statements that insult, demean, or humiliate (whether individually or by reference to groups) other employees, our extended workforce, our business partners, or others (including public figures), or that violate other standards of conduct or policies against harassment and bullying.

4. You are responsible for your words and your reach.

What you say and do matters and can have lasting impact. Be respectful in your comments about (and to) your fellow Googlers.

As a Googler, your comments — wherever you make them — can have a serious impact on other Googlers, yourself, and our company. We’re all free to raise concerns and respectfully question and debate the company’s activities — that’s part of our culture. Be sure to speak with good information. Don’t assume you have the full story, and take care not to make false or misleading statements about Google’s products or business that could undermine trust in our products and the work that we do.

5. Treat our data with care.

Keep in mind that our communications can be rapidly and broadly disseminated. Do not access, disclose, or disseminate Need-to-Know or Confidential information in violation of our Data Security Policy.

You are responsible for adhering to these guidelines, our Code of Conduct, and other workplace policies. If discussions or behavior don’t align with this policy, managers and discussion owners/moderators are expected to intervene. If necessary we will remove particular discussion forums, revoke commenting, viewing, or posting privileges, or take disciplinary action.

Iran clearly did not want a repeat of the iconic image from a 2009 protest that showed the killing of a young female student by security forces . Its attempt to hide the truth about last month ’ s violence failed .
Yet Iran is hardly alone in the way it indirectly honors global standards by hiding its actions against protesters . In August , India shut down electronic communications in Kashmir after it changed the territory ’ s legal status in order to prevent the world from seeing a crackdown on thousands of dissidents . China , too , has tried to block information about its human rights abuses against millions of minority Uyghurs in Xinjiang . In fact , China ’ s concern about international opinion may be a big reason it has not massacred pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong the way it did during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests .
Since 2009 , as global access to the internet has increased by 27 % , the use of disinformation by governments has increased by 10 % , according to the Institute for Economics and Peace , a nonprofit think tank . Yet the free flow of information is a main reason a majority of countries are more at peace than in the past , finds the institute .
As democracy has spread , and with it prosperity and literacy , so has the sunlight on nondemocratic actors who still see state violence as legitimate .

In effect, it imposed an information blackout to the rest of the world. Now we know why. Videos and other reports sent out since then show police on a killing spree against peaceful protesters. At least 208 people were killed, estimates Amnesty International.

Yet the crackdown is not a big surprise, especially for a regime with declining popularity at home and a rising tendency for violence abroad. What’s new is the degree to which Iran’s leaders tried to shield their atrocities from the world’s eyes.

It is as if they know global norms favoring the protection of innocent civilians are getting stronger and the stakes for breaking those norms are getting higher. Iran clearly did not want a repeat of the iconic image from a 2009 protest that showed the killing of a young female student by security forces. Its attempt to hide the truth about last month’s violence failed.

Yet Iran is hardly alone in the way it indirectly honors global standards by hiding its actions against protesters. In August, India shut down electronic communications in Kashmir after it changed the territory’s legal status in order to prevent the world from seeing a crackdown on thousands of dissidents. China, too, has tried to block information about its human rights abuses against millions of minority Uyghurs in Xinjiang. In fact, China’s concern about international opinion may be a big reason it has not massacred pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong the way it did during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.

Since 2009, as global access to the internet has increased by 27%, the use of disinformation by governments has increased by 10%, according to the Institute for Economics and Peace, a nonprofit think tank. Yet the free flow of information is a main reason a majority of countries are more at peace than in the past, finds the institute.

As democracy has spread, and with it prosperity and literacy, so has the sunlight on nondemocratic actors who still see state violence as legitimate. And as more tyrants act in ways to avoid shame, the more they admit they live within humanity’s moral circles. Their attempts at darkness are a sign of light.",www.csmonitor.com,center,BvTOF1tCo6YAxdbY

The statement was met with resounding applause . I mentally prepared for the response to what I was going to say next .
It was September , and I was at a forum at which several professors , including me , discussed free speech issues before a large audience of students at the University of California Berkeley . Several faculty and students had already implored Chancellor Carol Christ to revoke the invitations of conservative provocateurs Milo Yiannopoulos and Ann Coulter to speak on campus , and their declarations were met with enthusiasm .
Read Robert Post ’ s argument that it makes little sense to apply the First Amendment to colleges here .
Finally , I spoke up . “ Be clear that if Chancellor Christ were to exclude speakers based on their viewpoint , she would get sued and lose , ” I said . “ The speakers would get an injunction and be allowed to speak . They would recover attorneys ’ fees and maybe money damages . They would be portrayed as victims . And since they would get to speak anyway , nothing would be gained . ”
I have been dean of Berkeley ’ s law school for several months . But before I arrived at campus , the university , home of the free speech movement of the 1960s , had become a battleground for a new kind of campus speech debate .
In late September , elaborate security precautions were taken when conservative commentator Ben Shapiro spoke at Berkeley ; $ 600,000 had to be spent so he could deliver his remarks without disruption . When conservative student groups attempted to host a “ Free Speech Week , ” and invited conservative speakers like Coulter and Steve Bannon , the campus steeled itself to spend in excess of $ 1 million to allow them to speak while ensuring safety on the campus . ( In the end , “ Free Speech Week ” was canceled by the student group that had organized it . )
I have been teaching First Amendment law to law students and undergraduates for more than 37 years . I have also litigated free speech cases , including at the Supreme Court . I believe that Chancellor Christ and the campus have done a superb job of adhering to the First Amendment , protecting free speech while ensuring the safety of students , staff , and faculty . But it ’ s also become clear to me that current college students are often ambivalent , or even hostile , to the idea of free speech on campus .
Students today are driven by a desire to protect their classmates from hate speech
Disputes over free speech on campus have long occurred , but today is different . Usually in the past , it was students who wanted to speak out and campus administrators who tried to stop demonstrations . Now it often is about outside speakers and outside disruptors , like the radical leftist protest group antifa . The campus is just the place for their battle .
At Berkeley and elsewhere , it is now often students and faculty calling for preventing the speakers while campus officials are steadfastly protecting freedom of expression .
In my seminars the past two years ( before Berkeley , I was at UC Irvine ’ s law school ) , I was surprised by how much the students wanted campuses to stop offensive speech — and the degree to which they trusted campus officials to have the power to do so . A 2015 survey by the Pew Research Institute said that four in 10 college students believe the government should be able to prevent people from publicly making statements that are offensive to minority groups .
While teaching our class on free speech on campus at UC Irvine , Chancellor Howard Gillman and I realized that the students ’ desire to restrict hurtful speech came from laudable instincts . This is the first generation of college students to be taught from a young age that bullying is wrong ; they have internalized this message . Many spoke powerfully of instances in which they or their friends had suffered from hurtful speech . They want to make campuses inclusive for all , and they know that hate speech causes great harm , especially among those who have been traditionally underrepresented in higher education .
But I worry , too , that students do not realize the degree to which free speech has been essential for the advancement of rights and equality . There would not have been a 19th Amendment , which gave women the right to vote , without the women ’ s suffrage movement and its widespread demonstrations . The civil rights protests of the 1960s — lunch counter sit-ins , the march on Selma , demonstrations on campuses — were essential to bringing about the end of segregation .
Those events , though , are ancient history for my students . I worry that they equate freedom of speech more with the vitriol of the anonymous messaging app Yik Yak than the anti-Vietnam War protests I participated in when I was in college . I was surprised by how little our students knew about the history of free speech , including the outbreak of McCarthyism , when faculty and students suffered greatly from the lack of legal protection for expression and academic freedom .
Although all of this makes the context different today , the law of the First Amendment and the principles of academic freedom are clear and long established . The Supreme Court repeatedly has said that the First Amendment means public institutions can not punish speech , or exclude speakers , on the grounds that it is hateful or deeply offensive . This includes public colleges and universities .
Every effort by the government to regulate hate speech has been declared unconstitutional . Over 25 years ago , more than 350 colleges and universities adopted hate speech codes . But every court to consider such a hate speech code declared it to be unconstitutional . The codes inevitably were far too vague in terms of what speech was permitted and what was prohibited . Of course , free speech is not absolute and can be punished when it incites illegal activity , constitutes a “ true threat ” that causes a person to fear imminent harm to his or her physical safety , or rises to the level of prohibited harassment .
This does not mean that campuses are powerless in the face of disruptive or hateful speech . Even though there is a First Amendment right to speak , that does not mean that protesters have the right to demonstrate in the middle of a freeway at rush hour . A campus surely could prohibit a large demonstration in a classroom building while classes are in session . Campuses can regulate when and where speech takes place in order to prevent disruption of school activities . Controversial speakers can be placed in auditoriums where it is easier to assure safety and prevent disruptions . Demonstrations can be placed in areas away from where classes are in session .
Although the First Amendment applies only to the government , including public universities , private universities should follow these same principles . They are essential to academic freedom , which is at the very core of a university ’ s mission .
There might be a point at which it is impossible to simultaneously protect public safety and allow controversial speech to occur . Then campus officials have no choice but to prevent the speech , given that they must provide for the safety of students , staff , and faculty . But canceling a speaker should truly be a last resort and never based on the viewpoint expressed .
At what point should a campus cancel a speaker because it can not afford to ensure the safety of students , staff , and faculty ? Chancellor Christ has estimated that already this semester , the campus has spent more than $ 2 million to protect free speech . I believe Berkeley campus officials made the right choice in protecting these speakers from harm , but I also know that such expenditures are not sustainable .
Although speakers have a right to express hateful messages on campus , that does not mean that campus officials should silently tolerate such speech . It is important that campus officials denounce hate when it occurs and explain why it is inconsistent with the type of community we desire .
Education is enhanced when there is more speech , not when speech is regulated by campus officials
The law is clear that a public university may not exclude a speaker based on his or her views , nor may students or faculty be punished for the views they express . In a separate piece for ███ , professor Robert Post challenges this by suggesting that usual free speech principles should not apply on campus . He argues that campuses must of course engage in content-based judgments in evaluating a faculty member ’ s scholarship or a student ’ s work . From this , he concludes that universities are justified in excluding outside speakers that do not serve the educational mission of the campus .
Post ’ s premise is undoubtedly correct : Universities must evaluate the content of faculty and student work . But it does not follow that outside of this realm , free speech principles do not apply on campus . It is a logical fallacy to say that because basic free speech principles sometimes do not apply on campus , they must never apply .
First , it is important to distinguish what the law is from what Post thinks the law should be . Under current First Amendment law , a public university clearly would be acting unconstitutionally if it excluded a speaker from campus based on his or her viewpoint . When Auburn University attempted to prevent white supremacist Richard Spencer from speaking , a federal court ruled against the university .
Second , Post ignores the distinction between the university ’ s ability to regulate speech in professional settings ( such as in grading students ’ papers or in evaluating teaching and scholarship ) and its ability to regulate speech in other contexts . The former does not justify a university ’ s ability to restrict campus speakers based on viewpoint or to punish student or faculty speech in a nonprofessional setting .
Professor Post also argues that a primary purpose of a university is to educate students — so a campus would be justified in excluding speakers that it perceives as interfering with this mission . But the law says quite the contrary . It does not allow a public university to exclude a speaker by claiming that the viewpoint expressed would be so offensive to students that it would interfere with their education . Also , this would seem to give unlimited discretion to campus officials to exclude or punish any speaker that they deemed to be inconsistent with students ’ education . The assumption of freedom of speech , and of academic freedom , is that education is enhanced when there is more speech , not when government officials have the power to censor and punish speech they don ’ t like .
Having seen the enormous amount of time and money invested by the Berkeley campus to deal with the appearances of Ben Shapiro and Milo Yiannopoulos , I can not help but wish this had happened someplace else . But I know that Berkeley , especially because of its history with the free speech movement of the 1960s , is a unique place for expression . This is why it is so important that the campus did all it could to ensure freedom of speech . It is also why this campus has the chance to be a model for other schools in upholding the principle that all ideas and views can be expressed at colleges and universities .

Tyranny can arrive fast in the form of tanks and jackboots. Or it can come gradually, snuffing out liberty and replacing it with fear.

The latter is what we’re facing today, as cultural Marxists advance their doctrines and silence any dissension.

Each day brings new examples, but here are a few that show why a sleeping church and any friend of liberty had better wake up before it’s too late.

Social media giants Facebook, Twitter, Vimeo, Google’s YouTube and even Pinterest have all been caught censoring Christians and conservatives. Most of it is being done at the behest of LGBTQ activists.

If that particular issue is of no concern, consider the famous quote by once-Nazi supporter and then-foe Martin Niemoller.

I have some thoughts . Here ’ s what happened . — Kyle Kashuv ( @ KyleKashuv ) June 17 , 2019
2/ A few weeks ago , I was made aware of egregious and callous comments classmates and I made privately years ago – when I was 16 years old , months before the shooting – in an attempt to be as extreme and shocking as possible . I immediately apologized . Here is my apology : pic.twitter.com/eI38ziiQE8 — Kyle Kashuv ( @ KyleKashuv ) June 17 , 2019
3/ After I issued this apology , speculative articles were written , my peers used the opportunity to attack me , and my life was once again reduced to a headline . It sent me into one of the darkest spirals of my life . — Kyle Kashuv ( @ KyleKashuv ) June 17 , 2019
4/ After the story broke , former peers & political opponents began contacting Harvard urging them to rescind me . Harvard then sent this letter stating that Harvard “ reserves the right to withdraw an offer of admission ” and requested a written explanation within 72 hours . pic.twitter.com/RfEQCvjgDX — Kyle Kashuv ( @ KyleKashuv ) June 17 , 2019
5/ I responded to the letter with a full explanation , apology , and requested documents . pic.twitter.com/yWd6FeKWOJ — Kyle Kashuv ( @ KyleKashuv ) June 17 , 2019

9/ After receiving Harvard ’ s letter revoking my acceptance , I responded by asking for the opportunity to have an in-person meeting to make my case face to face and work towards any possible path of reconciliation . Harvard responded by declining my meeting request . pic.twitter.com/rdsGU7BhjD — Kyle Kashuv ( @ KyleKashuv ) June 17 , 2019
10/ Harvard deciding that someone can ’ t grow , especially after a life-altering event like the shooting , is deeply concerning . If any institution should understand growth , it ’ s Harvard , which is looked to as the pinnacle of higher education despite its checkered past . — Kyle Kashuv ( @ KyleKashuv ) June 17 , 2019
11/ Throughout its history , Harvard ’ s faculty has included slave owners , segregationists , bigots and antisemites . If Harvard is suggesting that growth isn ’ t possible and that our past defines our future , then Harvard is an inherently racist institution . But I don ’ t believe that . — Kyle Kashuv ( @ KyleKashuv ) June 17 , 2019
12/ I believe that institutions and people can grow . I ’ ve said that repeatedly . In the end , this isn ’ t about me , it ’ s about whether we live in a society in which forgiveness is possible or mistakes brand you as irredeemable , as Harvard has decided for me . — Kyle Kashuv ( @ KyleKashuv ) June 17 , 2019
13/ So what now ? I ’ m figuring it out . I had given up huge scholarships in order to go to Harvard , and the deadline for accepting other college offers has ended . I ’ m exploring all options at the moment . — Kyle Kashuv ( @ KyleKashuv ) June 17 , 2019
As far as his Harvard qualifications , they weren ’ t based on his activism . Kashuv was ranked second in his class , with a weighted GPA of 5.345 and an unweighted GPA of 3.9 ; he scored a 1550 on his SATs . But Kashuv ’ s activism has been impressive nonetheless : he has worked consistently across the aisle to bring about school safety measures to protect other high schoolers , and that his terrible comments were written before the life-changing event the mass shooting at Parkland represented .
Kashuv ’ s comments were originally surfaced by fellow students who oppose him politically , in an overt attempt to damage him . Kashuv did the right thing and issued an immediate apology :
A quick note on callous comments I made a few years ago in high school that are circulating . pic.twitter.com/E6Ki6XIhtc — Kyle Kashuv ( @ KyleKashuv ) May 23 , 2019
In a normal world , this would have been enough . Kashuv is 18 years old , and he wrote the comments when he was 16 . He didn ’ t commit a crime ; he didn ’ t espouse his gross views publicly ; his behavior since has not mimicked any of the content or attitude of the comments . He also underwent a life-changing trauma — the kind of trauma that has provided an unbreakable shield of protection from the media for all other Parkland survivors . Hell , criticizing outspoken anti-gun activist David Hogg was considered an act of extreme evil by the mainstream media , an act worthy of advertiser boycott .
His apology wasn ’ t sufficient , Harvard determined . Instead , Harvard University issued a letter asking Kashuv to explain his comments or face the rescinding of his attendance .
Before responding to the main email , Kashuv wrote this one to the Office of Diversity Education and Support :
Around two years ago , when I was 16 years old , before the mass shooting that occurred at my high school , Marjory Stoneman Douglas , I was part of a group in which we used abhorrent racial slurs . We did so out of a misplaced sense of humor : we treated the words themselves as though they bore little weight , and used them only for their shock value . Looking back two years later , I can not recognize that person . I make absolutely no excuse for those comments . I said them , and I regret them deeply . I bore no racial animus whatsoever : the context was a group of adolescents trying to use the worst words and say the most insane things imaginable . The horrible things I said were not directed to any specific person or individual , and my intent was never to hurt anyone . I do not have access to the electronic record of that conversation and do not recall other things that may have been said ; I have only seen what has appeared in the media . When reminded of those comments , I immediately apologized publicly , knowing that there would be an immediate media uproar , given that I have become a public figure over the past year . That uproar did ensue , and I have continued to accept responsibility for my comments , and I accept fully the resulting legitimate criticism . I am entirely embarrassed and do not recognize the person who wrote those things . As you may not know , I had already intended to take a gap year to continue my school safety activism , before beginning my studies in the fall of 2020 . I will hope to enter Harvard as a more mature member of the community , with three years and many life experiences between the foolish child who said those things two years ago and the man I am today and wish to become in the future . I am deeply sorry for my past comments , I know I am not the same person . But I realize there is always more I can do to understand and learn about the struggle and pain of minority communities in America and worldwide . During my gap year , I will supplement my activism to include reaching out to minority communities . I am open to any advice or suggestions on activities I might pursue during my gap year in pursuit of that goal . I am committed to engaging on this issue , and I plan to visit your office when I arrive at Harvard in the fall of 2020 after I complete my gap year .
Then Kashuv wrote this response to William Fitzsimmons , dean of admissions and financial aid :
Dear Mr. Fitzsimmons : Thank you for the opportunity to elaborate on what has been a very difficult and painful public controversy , which has left me with feelings of deep regret over an episode I had long forgotten . Let me first state that I apologize unequivocally for my comments , which were made two years ago in private among equally immature high school students . In the attached document , I have attached all the comments I have been able to record . I do not have access to the electronic record of that conversation and do not recall other things that may have been said ; I have only seen what has appeared in the media . I take full responsibility for the idiotic and hurtful things I wrote two years ago . I make absolutely no excuse for those comments . I said them , I regret them , and by explaining the context and my subsequent experiences I am not trying to excuse them . Instead , I am seeking to demonstrate the hurtful things I said do not represent the man I am today . I understand Harvard ’ s concern over these offensive statements from my past , and I further understand that Harvard has been contacted about them by people expressing concern about them . I am very sorry to have put the College in this position . I am determined to take whatever steps are necessary to rectify this past wrong and to reassure Harvard of my commitment to values of tolerance , diversity , and inclusion , which I hope to advance as a member of the class of 2024 . This is the context in which I made these comments . While this does not excuse my comments , I made poor choices with regards to the people I surrounded myself with , I became part of a group in which those words bore little weight and were used only in a means for their shock value . I bore no racial animus ; the context was a group of adolescents trying to use the worst words and say the most insane things imaginable . Until these writings were disclosed , I had long forgotten about them . While I will forever bear incredible shame for typing them , I especially feel remorse now that they have been made public knowing they have caused terrible pain to people I care about . I gave no consideration to the meaning and weight of the words I wrote in an effort to impress then friends and classmates , and looking back I know clearly know I wrote terrible things I can never unwrite . My intent was never to hurt anyone , and to do so would have magnified the harm immensely . I also feel I am no longer the same person , especially in the aftermath of the Parkland shooting and all that has transpired since . I had to mature not only to address that horrible situation but to fulfill my new role as a school safety activist . I have tried hard to be a better man in honor of the friends I lost , and I believe I have grown and matured significantly through this experience . I am proud of some of the things I have accomplished in the wake of that tragedy , and I do not recognize the person who wrote those things . When I was reminded of the writings I was mortified and embarrassed . My parents raised me to be better than what is represented in those screenshots from about two years ago . In an effort to be as honest and transparent as possible , I immediately apologized publicly when reminded of those messages , while knowing the media uproar that would ensue . It did ensue , and I have continued to accept responsibility and the resulting legitimate criticism . As you know , I intend to take a gap year before beginning my studies to continue my work promoting school safety . I will continue to mature and will enter Harvard with three years and many life experiences between the foolish child who said those things and the man I am today . As an aspiring member of the Harvard community , I aspire to the values that the community strives to uphold . Therefore I have already written to the Harvard College Office of Diversity Education and Support both to express my deepest apologies and remorse , and to reach out to begin a dialogue that I hope will be the foundation of future growth . While I am no longer the same person who wrote those comments , there is always more to learn : especially about the legacy of racism in our society . Thank you again for this opportunity to address these issues . I hope this fully addresses your concerns , but if not I would be happy to provide any further information or discussion you require .
No good . Harvard sent Kashuv a blunt letter kicking him out of Harvard :
Dear Mr. Kashuv , Thank you for your response to our letter of May 24 . The Admissions Committee has discussed at length your account of the communications about which we asked , and we appreciated your candor and your expressions of regret for sending them . As you know , the Committee takes seriously the qualifies of maturity and moral character . After careful consideration the Committee voted to rescind your admission to Harvard College . We are sorry about the circumstances that have led us to withdraw your admission , and we wish you success in your future academic endeavors and beyond .
This is , to put it mildly , gutless . There are ex-convicts who , quite properly , have been admitted to Harvard — they earned forgiveness . There are current students who undoubtedly have said things privately that would shock the conscience . There are likely administrators who have said things when they were 16 years old that embarrass them now . Is the new standard that if you said something on a private message board when you were 16 years old that we should deny you the possibility of a degree at a top college , so long as those who join you on that message board decide to out you ?
This isn ’ t about Kashuv ’ s politics . I ’ ve worked with other Parkland survivors including Cameron Kasky , with whom I disagree politically , but who happens to be a wonderful young man — I would certainly defend him if something similar happened to him . I ’ ve defended Sarah Jeong of The New York Times from calls to be fired over her old tweets ; I ’ ve done the same with James Gunn ; I ’ ve even suggested that Virginia Governor Ralph Northam ought to be judged based on his lifelong career record on race , not based on a racist yearbook photo . I ’ ve stumped against the social media bannings of people with whom I virulently disagree — people who have in fact targeted me personally .
This move by Harvard is the worst move I ’ ve ever seen in academia — and it represents the establishment of a standard so insane that no one can possibly withstand it . All those who have never written an embarrassing thing privately , please step forward . Not so fast , SJWs .
The move comes just three weeks after Harvard University fired Professor Ronald Sullivan and his wife Stephanie from their deanships at Winthrop House over the apparently unforgiveable sin of Sullivan ’ s representation of alleged rapist Harvey Weinstein . Sullivan was ousted because students said they were offended by Sullivan doing what he ’ s always done : defending alleged criminals . Over at Yale , Professor Nicholas Christakis and his wife Erica were effectively ousted from their roles as co-masters of Silliman House because they suggested that perhaps students shouldn ’ t take offense at Halloween costumes . Over at Evergreen College , Professor Bret Weinstein and his wife Professor Heather Heying were forced out over Weinstein ’ s refusal to stop teaching for a “ Day of Absence ” for white teachers .
Our colleges are irreparably broken ; the inmates are in charge of the asylum .
Kyle Kashuv acted like a dumb kid . He ’ s remorseful . Denying him the chance to prove it is horrifying . And if the new standard is that anyone whose old comments are resurfaced for fun and games can have their life ruined , no one will survive . I look forward to tasking my reporters with digging up everything everyone on the admissions committee has ever said . If these are the new rules , so be it .
But these are , apparently , the new rules . Kashuv is the first to feel the brunt . He certainly won ’ t be the last .","Our universities may be irrevocably broken.

On Monday, Parkland survivor and outspoken conservative Kyle Kashuv announced that Harvard University had withdrawn his admission from the school over the revelation of racist, offensive, idiotic posts written on a private Google document with friends when he was sixteen years old. Never mind that Kashuv apologized publicly for the comments; never mind that his public behavior has evinced no racism whatsoever.

Forgiveness must be withheld.

Kashuv explained:

Not quite seven weeks ago , conservative journalist Andy Ngo was attacked while covering an Antifa protest in Portland , Oregon . Mayor Tom Wheeler ordered police to stand down at the time and received backlash for doing so . The city prepared for the Proud Boys to hold a rally on Saturday , with Antifa showing up to counter protest .

ORIGINAL POST:

Not quite seven weeks ago, conservative journalist Andy Ngo was attacked while covering an Antifa protest in Portland, Oregon. Mayor Tom Wheeler ordered police to stand down at the time and received backlash for doing so. The city prepared for the Proud Boys to hold a rally on Saturday, with Antifa showing up to counter protest. Wheeler made it clear that Portland is taking a ""zero tolerance"" policy during Saturday's activities.

Despite the warning, Antifa, once again, became violent.

At one point, Antifa protestors had The Washington Examiner's Julio Rosas surrounded. They wanted him to report on what was taking place from the other side of the street because he ""wasn't with"" them.

Rosas attempted to explain that he was simply reporting on the events for his job but Antifa didn't care. They thought he was ""spying"" on them.

At one point an ad hoc march began in the park , with clumps of activists driving off some individuals by chanting , `` Go home , Nazis ! ''
In some places , individuals faced off with heated , verbal exchanges , with one person in a red `` Make America Great Again '' hat exchanging words with an African-American man in a red cap .
During some tense moments , a black street-preacher would emerge to defuse arguments . `` We 're going to surprise America , '' he told the crowd . `` They thought there would be a bloodbath , but we are going to love each other . ''

In his tweet , Trump echoed the event 's theme by noting that `` major consideration '' is being given to declaring the militant leftist group `` antifa '' as a terrorist organization .
On the other side , Rose City Antifa , whose activists normally wear masks to remain anonymous , have also said the goal of the far-right was to have antifa declared a domestic terrorist organization .
In Washington , Republican Sens . Ted Cruz of Texas and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana have introduced a congressional resolution calling for anti-fascists to be declared domestic terrorists .
The event , which had not been given a permit , was organized by Biggs and supported by Enrique Tarrio , national head of the Proud Boys , an all-male , far-right group that describes itself as `` Western chauvinists . ''
Some key bridges and roads were closed or blocked off and the city erected a half-mile of concrete barriers along the streets near the waterfront rally area .

In addition to the Proud Boys , the white nationalist American Guard and the Three Percenters , a far-right militia , have said they will have members in Portland . Hate group watchdogs say the Daily Stormers , a neo-Nazi group , are also expected .
The Oath Keepers , another far-right militia group , said in a statement they were pulling out of the rally because organizers have not done enough to keep white supremacist groups away .
Patriot Prayer ’ s Joey Gibson , who is not involved in this weekend ’ s event but organized similar rallies in the past two years that ended in clashes , turned himself in to police Friday on an arrest warrant for felony rioting . He was at a confrontation that broke out on May 1 outside a bar where members of the antifa movement had gathered after a May Day demonstration .
In a video he livestreamed on Facebook , Gibson accused the police of playing politics by arresting him but not the masked demonstrators who beat up conservative blogger Andy Ngo at a June 29 rally that drew national attention to this small , liberal city .
Ngo has not indicated whether he would attend Saturday 's rally , but said on Fox News 's `` The Ingraham Angle '' this week that `` the whole thing is a powder keg . ''

“ What I ’ m saying to everybody who ’ s listening to this ( is ) they ’ re trying to shut you guys up . They want you to not show up in Portland , they want to put fear in your hearts , ” Gibson said .
Why Portland ? It is viewed by many as an outpost of West Coast liberalism that has been particularly tolerant of free public expression in the past . Some critics argue that the police have not taken tough enough measures to head off clashes .

`` I think they come to Portland because it gives them a platform , ” says Wheeler , the mayor , according to The Oregonian . “ They know that if they come here conflict is almost guaranteed . ”
Portland 's feared confrontation Saturday is only the latest in a string of political skirmishes downtown . In June , three people were arrested as protesters and counter-protesters battled during random marches that followed two separate demonstrations .
The exchanges also deteriorated into attacks on police , with some antifa protesters throwing eggs and liquids at police officers , who responded with pepper spray near the Pioneer Courthouse Square .

Three people were treated for injuries at local hospitals , including Andy Ngo , a conservative writer who , The Oregonian reports , appeared to be attacked by antifa forces .

Some key bridges and roads were closed or blocked off and the city erected a half-mile of concrete barriers along the streets near the waterfront rally area.

Portland's feared confrontation Saturday is only the latest in a string of political skirmishes downtown. In June, three people were arrested as protesters and counter-protesters battled during random marches that followed two separate demonstrations.

The exchanges also deteriorated into attacks on police, with some antifa protesters throwing eggs and liquids at police officers, who responded with pepper spray near the Pioneer Courthouse Square.

Crowds eventually dispersed after police declared the gathering a civil disturbance and unlawful assembly.

Three people were treated for injuries at local hospitals, including Andy Ngo, a conservative writer who, The Oregonian reports, appeared to be attacked by antifa forces.

The June rally came almost a year after masked antifa forces threw eggs, water bottles and firecrackers at a march by the right-wing group Patriot Prayer, prompting police to declare a riot and revoke the march permit. Officers also seized knives, clubs and chemical spray from antifa supporters.

The law was created almost 30 years ago to protect internet platforms from liability for many of the things third parties say or do on them . And now it ’ s under threat by one of its biggest beneficiaries : President Trump , who hopes to use his new executive order to fight back against the social media platforms he believes are unfairly censoring him and other conservative voices .
Section 230 says that internet platforms that host third-party content — think of tweets on Twitter , posts on Facebook , photos on Instagram , reviews on Yelp , or a news outlet ’ s reader comments — are not liable for what those third parties post ( with a few exceptions ) . For instance , if a Yelp reviewer were to post something defamatory about a business , the business could sue the reviewer for libel , but it couldn ’ t sue Yelp . Without Section 230 ’ s protections , the internet as we know it today would not exist . If the law were taken away , many websites driven by user-generated content would likely go dark .
The gravity of the situation might be lost on the president . Trump is using this threat to bully social media platforms like Twitter into letting him post whatever he wants after Twitter put a warning label that links to a fact-checking site on two of his recent tweets . To illustrate why there ’ s much more at stake than Trump ’ s tweets , here ’ s a look at how Section 230 went from an amendment to a law about internet porn to the pillar of internet free speech to Trump ’ s latest weapon against perceived anti-conservative bias in the media .
In the early ’ 90s , the internet was still in its relatively unregulated infancy . There was a lot of porn floating around platforms like AOL and the World Wide Web where anyone , including our nation ’ s impressionable children , could see it . This alarmed some lawmakers . In an attempt to regulate this situation , in 1995 lawmakers introduced a bipartisan bill called the Communications Decency Act which would extend to the internet laws governing obscene and indecent use of telephone services . This would also make websites and platforms responsible for any indecent or obscene things their users posted .
In the midst of this was a lawsuit between two companies you might recognize : Stratton Oakmont and Prodigy . The former is featured in The Wolf of Wall Street , and the latter was a pioneer of the early internet . But in 1995 , Stratton Oakmont sued Prodigy for defamation after an anonymous user claimed on a Prodigy bulletin board that the financial company ’ s president engaged in fraudulent acts . As the New York Times explains the court ’ s decision :
The New York Supreme Court ruled that Prodigy was “ a publisher ” and therefore liable because it had exercised editorial control by moderating some posts and establishing guidelines for impermissible content . If Prodigy had not done any moderation , it might have been granted free speech protections afforded to some distributors of content , like bookstores and newsstands .
Fearing that the Communications Decency Act would stop the burgeoning internet in its tracks and mindful of the court ’ s decision , then-Rep. ( now Sen. ) Ron Wyden and Rep. Chris Cox authored an amendment that said that “ interactive computer services ” were not responsible for what their users posted , even if those services engaged in some moderation of that third-party content . The internet companies , in other words , were mere platforms , not publishers .
“ What I was struck by then is that if somebody owned a website or a blog , they could be held personally liable for something posted on their site , ” Wyden explained to ███ ’ s Emily Stewart last year . “ And I said then — and it ’ s the heart of my concern now — if that ’ s the case , it will kill the little guy , the startup , the inventor , the person who is essential for a competitive marketplace . It will kill them in the crib . ”
Section 230 also allows those services to “ restrict access ” to any content they deem objectionable . In other words , the platforms themselves get to choose what is and what is not acceptable content , and they can decide to host it or moderate it accordingly . That means the free speech argument frequently employed by people who are suspended or banned from these platforms — that the Constitution says they can write whatever they want — doesn ’ t apply , no matter how many times Laura Loomer tries to test it . As Harvard Law professor Laurence Tribe points out , the First Amendment argument is also generally misused in this context :
1 . The First Amendment limits only the Government , not private entities like Twitter .
2 . Anyway , Twitter ’ s tagging of Trump ’ s claims about write-in voting is itself absolutely protected under the First Amendment as an expression of opinion . — Laurence Tribe ( @ tribelaw ) May 27 , 2020
Wyden likens the dual nature of Section 230 to a sword and a shield for platforms : They ’ re shielded from liability for user content , and they have a sword to moderate it as they see fit .
The Communications Decency Act was signed into law in 1996 . The indecency and obscenity provisions , which made it a crime to transmit such speech if it could be viewed by a minor , were immediately challenged by civil liberty groups . The Supreme Court would ultimately strike them down , saying they were too restrictive of free speech . Section 230 stayed , and the law that was initially meant to restrict free speech on the internet instead became the law that protected it .
This protection has allowed the internet to thrive . Think about it : Websites like Facebook , Reddit , and YouTube have millions and even billions of users . If these platforms had to monitor and approve every single thing every user posted , they simply wouldn ’ t be able to exist . No website or platform can moderate at such an incredible scale , and no one wants to open themselves up to the legal liability of doing so .
That doesn ’ t mean Section 230 is perfect . Some argue that it gives platforms too little accountability , allowing some of the worst parts of the internet — think 8chan or sites that promote racism — to flourish along with the best . Simply put , internet platforms have been happy to use the shield to protect themselves from lawsuits , but they ’ ve largely ignored the sword to moderate the bad stuff their users upload .
In recent years , Section 230 has come under threat . In 2018 , two bills — the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act ( FOSTA ) and the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act ( SESTA ) — were signed into law , which changed parts of Section 230 . Now , platforms could be deemed responsible for prostitution ads posted by third parties . These were ostensibly meant to make it easier for authorities to go after websites that were used for sex trafficking , but they did this by carving out an exception to Section 230 . The law was vulnerable .
Amid all of this was a growing public sentiment that social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook were becoming too powerful . In the minds of many , Facebook even influenced the outcome of the 2016 presidential election by offering up its user data to shady outfits like Cambridge Analytica . There were also allegations of anti-conservative bias . Right-wing figures who once rode the internet ’ s relative lack of moderation to fame and fortune were being held accountable for various infringements of hateful content rules and kicked off the very platforms that helped created them . Alex Jones and his expulsion from Facebook and other social media platforms is perhaps the most illustrative example of this .
Republican Sen. Ted Cruz , demonstrating a profound misunderstanding of Section 230 , claimed in a 2018 op-ed that the law required the internet platforms it was designed to protect to be “ neutral public forums. ” Lawmakers have tried to introduce legislation that would fulfill that promise ever since .
Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert introduced the Biased Algorithm Deterrence Act in 2019 , which would consider any social media service that used algorithms to moderate content without the user ’ s permission or knowledge to be legally considered a publisher , not a platform , thereby removing Section 230 ’ s protections . ( Remember the Stratton Oakmont v. Prodigy case ? This bill would have hearkened back to that era . ) Later that year , Republican Sen. Josh Hawley introduced the Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act , which would require that , in order to be granted Section 230 protections , social media companies would have to show the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) that their content moderation practices were politically neutral .
Neither of those bills went anywhere , but the implications were obvious : Emboldened by FOSTA-SESTA , the two sex-trafficking bills from 2018 , lawmakers not only wanted to chip away at Section 230 but were actively testing out ways to do it .
Their latest attempt — and the most likely to succeed — is a bipartisan bill introduced in March called the Eliminating Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies ( EARN IT ) Act , from Sens . Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal . Here , the lawmakers used the prevention of child pornography as an avenue to both erode Section 230 and end encryption by requiring companies to follow a set of “ best practices ” or else lose their Section 230 immunity from child pornography charges .
Some privacy advocates worry that these best practices would extend to requiring tech companies to provide law enforcement with access to all user content . A law like this would effectively force websites to comply with those “ best practices , ” as they ’ d be sued out of existence if they didn ’ t . The law has bipartisan support , with Hawley and Democrat Dianne Feinstein among its nine cosponsors .
And now President Trump , who has benefited greatly from social media , is trying to dial back Section 230 ’ s protections through an executive order . Trump signed the order roughly 48 hours after Twitter applied a new policy of flagging potentially false or misleading content to two of the president ’ s tweets . At the signing ceremony , Trump referred to Twitter ’ s actions as “ editorial decisions , ” and Attorney General Bill Barr referred to social media companies as “ publishers . ”
Barr is not a fan of Section 230 , and his Department of Justice has been looking into the law and how he believes it allows “ selective ” removal of political speech . Barr added that he thinks there is bipartisan support that Section 230 “ has been stretched way beyond its original intention ” and was allowing “ behemoths ” that controlled massive amounts of information to censor it and “ act as editors and publishers . ”
“ They ’ ve had unchecked power to censure , restrict , edit , shape , hide , alter virtually any form of communication between private citizens or large public audiences , ” Trump said in the Oval Office on Thursday . “ We can not allow that to happen , especially when they go about doing what they ’ re doing . ”
It ’ s unclear if Trump ’ s executive order could stop social media companies from doing much at all . The White House did not immediately release the full text of the executive order after Trump signed it . The order says that platforms that engage in anything beyond “ good faith ” moderation of content should be considered publishers and therefore not entitled to Section 230 ’ s protections . It also calls on the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) to propose regulations that clarify what constitutes “ good faith ; ” the FTC to take action against “ large internet platforms ” that “ restrict speech ; ” and the attorney general to work with state attorneys general to see if those platforms violate any state laws regarding unfair business practices .
While the order talks a big game , legal experts don ’ t seem to think much — or even any — of it can be backed up , citing First Amendment concerns . It ’ s also unclear whether or not the FCC has the authority to regulate Section 230 in this way , or if the president can change the scope of a law without any congressional approval .
“ I have warned for years that this administration was threatening 230 in order to chill speech and bully companies like Facebook , YouTube , and Twitter into giving him favorable treatment , ” Wyden said in a statement . “ Today Trump proved me right . I expect those companies , and every American who participates in online speech , to resist this illegal act by all possible means . Giving in to bullying by this president may be the single most unpatriotic act an American could undertake . ”
“ As the co-author of Section 230 , let me make this clear : There is nothing in the law about political neutrality , ” Wyden added . “ It does not say companies like Twitter are forced to carry misinformation about voting , especially from the president . Efforts to erode Section 230 will only make online content more likely to be false and dangerous . ”

Needless to say, Section 230’s creator isn’t thrilled.

It all started with President Woodrow Wilson . On April 2 , 1917 , Wilson urged the nation into battle against Germany in order to `` make the world safe for democracy . '' But the president also set his sights on certain enemies located much closer to home . `` Millions of men and women of German birth and native sympathy…live among us , '' Wilson observed . `` If there should be disloyalty , it will be dealt with with a firm hand of repression . ''
That firm hand came in the form of the Espionage Act , which Congress passed in June 1917 and Wilson eagerly signed into law . Among other things , the act made it illegal to `` convey information with intent to interfere with the operation or success of the armed forces of the United States or to promote the success of its enemies . '' That sweeping language effectively criminalized most forms of anti-war speech . If convicted of obstructing the war effort , the guilty party faced up to $ 10,000 in fines and up to 20 years in prison .
With that law in place , Wilson 's threats of repression soon became reality . In August , the federal government arrested and imprisoned Charles Schenck , the general secretary of the Socialist Party . His crime ? Printing and distributing thousands of anti-war leaflets . Schenck maintained that the First Amendment clearly protected his right to speak out in that manner against U.S. militarism , but his arguments fell on deaf ears .
On March 3 , 1919 , the U.S. Supreme Court upheld his conviction . `` When a nation is at war , '' declared Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. in Schenck v. United States , `` many things that might be said in time of peace are such a hindrance to its effort that their utterance will not be endured so long as men fight . '' He waved away the First Amendment consideration . `` The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic , '' he wrote . Censors have been quoting that sentence ever since .
One week later , Holmes dismissed the First Amendment yet again , this time upholding an Espionage Act conviction of the union leader and perennial Socialist Party presidential candidate Eugene Debs , who had been arrested in 1917 after giving a mildly anti-war speech at an afternoon picnic . `` This man is the palpitating pulse of the sedition crusade , '' federal prosecutor F.B . Kavanaugh had declared during the trial .
`` One purpose of [ Debs ' ] speech , whether incidental or not does not matter , was to oppose not only war in general but this war , '' Holmes wrote in Debs v. United States , `` and that the opposition was so expressed that its natural and intended effect would be to obstruct recruiting . ''
So much for `` Congress shall make no law…abridging the freedom of speech . '' Debs would languish in prison until 1921 , when he was finally pardoned by President Warren G. Harding .
These old cases have important lessons to teach us today . For starters , they demonstrate why the exercise of fundamental rights should never be subject to majority approval . The Espionage Act was passed by a democratically elected legislature and enforced by a democratically elected president , and it was probably in tune with the will of most Americans at that time . But of course , the whole point of the First Amendment is to place certain rights beyond the reach of the majority .
These cases also demonstrate the importance of an independent judiciary that is prepared to check the other branches of government when they go too far . It is no coincidence that Holmes was the justice who led the Court in trashing the First Amendment in Schenck and Debs . Far too often throughout his long career on the bench , he advocated judicial deference to majoritarian government .
`` A law should be called good , '' Holmes once wrote , `` if it reflects the will of the dominant forces of the community , even if it will take us to hell . '' That sort of judicial pacifism should have no place on the Supreme Court .","One hundred years ago, the U.S. government declared war on the First Amendment.

These cases also demonstrate the importance of an independent judiciary that is prepared to check the other branches of government when they go too far. It is no coincidence that Holmes was the justice who led the Court in trashing the First Amendment in Schenck and Debs. Far too often throughout his long career on the bench, he advocated judicial deference to majoritarian government.

""A law should be called good,"" Holmes once wrote, ""if it reflects the will of the dominant forces of the community, even if it will take us to hell."" That sort of judicial pacifism should have no place on the Supreme Court.",www.reason.com,right,yfKW1nPf5eTLD17T

Shame on Berkeley, cradle of the Free Speech Movement, and shame on lefty protesters who succeeded in thwarting conservative provocateur Ann Coulter’s right to speak there Thursday night.

Wednesday afternoon, officials at the University of California campus canceled the event fearing violent protests that would threaten students' safety. What’s alarming is this is part of a disturbing trend across some college campuses to silence conservative speakers whose ideas are unpopular. Three times since February, masked protesters at Berkeley have turned demonstrations into violent confrontations.

Something similar happened earlier this month at Claremont McKenna in southern California, when protesters disrupted Heather MacDonald of the conservative Manhattan Institute as she attempted to share her critical views on the Black Lives Matter movement. Last month, protesters rudely interrupted Charles Murray of the conservative American Enterprise Institute while speaking at Middlebury College. Administrators were forced to whisk him away to a safe location.

Academic environments should be a place for all students to learn and debate a robust variety of viewpoints — particularly if they contradict one’s own beliefs. Universities should do all they can to create an atmosphere for a free and fair exchange of ideas — and that means making it safe for controversial speakers and students.

Coulter, as many know, is an ultra-conservative, uber-Trump supporter whose ubiquitous presence drives the left wing crazy. She epitomizes and invites controversy. She’s made hundreds of outrageous statements that make one wonder if she actually believes them or is just a master at turning divisive remarks into an attention-getting art form.

America’s growing interest in soccer, she said, is a sign of “the nation’s moral decay.” And that “liberals love America like O.J. loved Nicole.” Coulter suggested if we took away women’s right to vote, “we'd never have to worry about another Democrat president.” Google her name and ‘ridiculous’ and up pops “Crazy Ann Coulter Quotes and Statements.”

But it doesn’t matter. She still has a right to express her thoughts. It’s called the First Amendment, and it protects her right to free speech.

Berkeley College Republicans and Young America's Foundation invited Coulter, a huge Trump supporter and right-wing darling, to speak Thursday night. Her attraction might be that she believes there are “no good democrats,” while acknowledging there are a “lot of bad Republicans.” Or they are drawn to her 2015 book, Adios, America: The Left's Plan to Turn Our Country into a Third World Hellhole.

First the university tried to push off the speaking engagement to the fall. But a backlash ensued, and Coulter threatened to speak anyway on the iconic Sproul Plaza, which ironically is outside of Sproul Hall, where the Free Speech Movement of the 1960s began.

Coulter should have been allowed to speak at the birthplace of a movement that began because students in 1964 were angry that the university banned on-campus political activities. Students then were demanding their right to free speech.

The same right to free speech Berkeley College Republicans are demanding for themselves and Coulter. The university offered to try to allow her to speak next week in the afternoon — but that’s when classes will be over and students madly studying for exams.

“What are you afraid of ― her ideas?” asked Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a fan of the liberal college wing. “Ask her the hard questions,” he concluded. “Confront her intellectually. Booing people down, or intimidating people, or shutting down events, I don’t think that that works in any way.”

The right to free speech, enshrined in our Constitution, is one of the hallmarks that proudly differentiates America from more restrictive governments. It means anyone has the right to spew abhorrent political views on the right or left without fear of a violent crowd turning on them — especially on a university campus.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

“Freedom of speech means freedom for those who you despise, and freedom to express the most despicable views,” said noted legal scholar Alan Dershowitz.

Berkeley said that there are two principles that are non-negotiable on its campus: free speech and campus safety. But this time, campus safety trumps free speech. It’s hard to believe that a campus such as Berkeley couldn’t find a way to protect Coulter, or that this invitation came as a surprise to them.

Regardless of our political beliefs, we should all stand firmly behind Coulter. Even a few strange bedfellows support Coulter: Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, MSNBC’s Chris Matthews, HBO’s Bill Maher and Bloomberg View columnist Margaret Carlson.

“I’m very sad about Berkeley's cancelation, but my sadness is greater than that,” tweeted Coulter. “It is a dark day for free speech in America.”

Hard to argue against her on that.

Throughout the 2000s , then–Harvard professor Elizabeth Warren wanted desperately to influence members of Congress . She wanted the government to enact stricter regulations on banks and home loans , and she vigorously advocated that policy . She testified before Congress , worked with a number of groups to promote her plans , and shared her perspectives with as many policymakers as possible . As she recounted in a presidential town hall this year : “ I was waving my arms , ringing the bell , doing everything I could . I said families are getting cheated all over this country . . . . I went everywhere I could . I talked about it to anyone who would listen — a crisis is coming . ”
“ Anyone who would listen ” included members of Congress . NBC News reported that Warren “ bent the ear of [ then-senator ] Hillary Clinton , ” and by the Democratic primary campaign in 2007 Warren was “ lobbying candidates behind the scenes to create what would become the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau . ”
In 2019 , Senator Elizabeth Warren is proposing legislation that would restrict , tax , regulate , and otherwise impede the activities of Americans who want to advocate public policies , just as she herself did ten years ago . She calls it a plan to end corruption . It won ’ t work ; in fact it will hurt the very people it is supposed to help , and will establish deeply rooted government bureaucrats who can shut down — or even jail — Americans who speak out or support groups that speak out . Whether or not it becomes law , the proposal offers a window into the way all too many progressives ( and even some conservatives ) approach the regulation of politics and political speech .
Senator Warren frames her measure as an attack on the influence of the wealthy , but it is really an attack on the influence of anyone outside government . The proposed law would regulate as lobbying virtually any activity intended to influence any government action . It would tax any organization , no matter how large , that spends more than $ 500,000 per year on “ lobbying. ” Anything more than that is “ excessive , ” she writes .
Does that look good on paper ? It won ’ t in practice . For comparison ’ s sake , note that the federal government spent over $ 4 trillion in 2018 alone . Federal regulations impose additional costs on Americans each year amounting to trillions of dollars . Major government projects are enormously expensive : The Trump administration recently diverted $ 3.6 billion in military funds for the construction of a border wall , and that only scratches the surface of the wall ’ s total projected cost .
Most Americans don ’ t hold a prestigious post at Harvard University and never receive an invitation to testify before Congress . They must make their voices heard by joining membership organizations , pooling their resources , and speaking as a group . Imposing a special tax on groups that spend less than 0.000012 percent of what the leviathan they ’ re up against spends insulates the powerful from critique and opposition , accomplishing exactly the opposite of the proposal ’ s anti-corruption goals .
Progressives imagine that such a law would sap the political strength of groups such as the National Rifle Association and the Chamber of Commerce . Then they would have a better chance of passing aggressive policies on gun control and climate change . But the same law would kneecap the ACLU and Planned Parenthood . Both organizations spend over a million dollars per year on lobbying . The proposed law ’ s expanded definition of lobbying would also harm groups with little involvement in partisan politics , such as the American Red Cross and United Way of America .
Senator Warren writes that “ the goal of these measures is straightforward : To take power away from the wealthy and the well-connected in Washington and put it back where it belongs — in the hands of the people. ” But what about the people who support groups such as the NRA or the ACLU — organizations with over a million members each — or any one of the thousands of groups that keep a watchful eye on the government while their members are busy living their lives ?
Working together , those Americans have a real voice . Will the federal bureaucracy listen to them better when their voice is reduced to a whisper ? Or will it turn to fellow bureaucrats and friendly “ experts ” — maybe university professors — to lead the way ?
Senator Warren ’ s proposal tells the government to fill the gaps her plan would leave in civil society . It creates a “ National Public Advocate ” to “ help the public engage ” with the regulatory-
rulemaking process . In the process for public comment on proposed regulations , it also would withhold any non-peer-reviewed research deemed to have “ conflicts of interest. ” What does that even mean ? Groups that file comments with regulatory agencies have no decision-making power over those agencies , which is the standard that would traditionally establish a conflict-of-interest concern . Senator Warren ’ s proposal appears aimed at silencing those who stand to gain or lose from a proposed regulation . Shouldn ’ t the government hear from people who will be affected by its actions ?
This gets to the fundamental flaw in Warren ’ s approach : It misdiagnoses the problems in our democracy . Advocacy groups are not the enemy of the people . They are the voices of the people , amplified so that government can not easily ignore them . In aiming to restrict those voices , Senator Warren ’ s bill would weaken our democracy to strengthen the bureaucracy . What she calls power for the people is actually power for politicians .
True small- “ d ” democratic reforms would make it easier to participate in the political process . We should reduce and simplify the hundreds of pages of statutes and regulations that make up our federal campaign-finance laws . Americans should not need to consult an attorney to promote a policy idea or a campaign . This approach would put real power in the hands of the people . Maybe that ’ s why politicians shy away from it .
Instead , they propose plans that would wreak havoc on constitutional rights in order to limit the ability to oppose government action . But just as the government can not tax the “ excessive ” exercise of religion , or the “ excessive ” publishing of newspaper editorials , it has no business imposing a special tax on groups that exercise their petition rights “ excessively. ” The Supreme Court has consistently struck down limits on how much private individuals and organizations can spend to promote or oppose a candidate for office . Similarly , bans on some types of lobbying and a tax on “ excessive lobbying ” are likely to face constitutional challenges . Senator Warren ’ s proposal also would ban lobbyists from making campaign contributions , serving as bundlers , or hosting fundraisers . Yet the First Amendment protects both the right to petition and the right to give to candidates . The government can not demand that you sacrifice one First Amendment right to exercise another .
Far from being a bold path forward , Warren ’ s proposed law doubles down on the same flawed approach that has driven efforts to regulate campaign finance for nearly 50 years : regulate more activity and punish violations more harshly .

The Senate Judiciary Committee grilled the companies ' top execs over a perceived anti-conservative bias , with some Republicans renewing calls for government regulation of social media platforms .
Sen. Ted Cruz ( R–Texas ) opened the hearing , saying that `` nobody—or at least nobody in their right mind—wants to see a government speech police . '' But he outlined several ways where he wants government intervention . Most notably , he suggested that social media networks could lose their status under Section 230 , which protects the content-sharing companies from various lawsuits .
If that happened , Facebook and Twitter would be liable for any and all libelous comments made on their sites—a tall order , especially when you remember that Facebook gets a billion new posts each day . Such a move would almost certainly lead to increased censorship , with tech companies actively seeking to quash comments that might attract lawsuits .
Cruz also proposed using antitrust laws to break up big tech , and he said that cases of alleged censorship could be litigated as fraud .
Whether or not social media platforms push an anti-conservative agenda has been a matter of ongoing debate , as much of the evidence is anecdotal . Sen. Marsha Blackburn ( R–Tenn . ) mentioned that her campaign announcement video was temporarily removed from Twitter in 2017 after it was deemed inflammatory . She likened social media to a `` town square , '' saying a sheriff—in this case the federal government—is necessary to preserve fairness and order . Carlos J. Monje , Jr. , the director of public policy and philanthropy for Twitter 's presence in U.S. and Canada , apologized and said the company had `` made the wrong call '' in taking down her ad .
Meanwhile , ranking member Mazie Hirono ( D–Hawaii ) lambasted the notion that social media platforms discriminate against conservatives . She named a number of anti-bias efforts undertaken by social media platforms to appease Republicans and listed a range of experts who had found no evidence to support such claims . That social media companies are blind to ideology can be seen in the case of Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D–Mass . ) , Hirono argued . Not unlike Blackburn , the liberal presidential hopeful recently had a campaign ad removed by Facebook .
Hirono claimed that the real threat is the online proliferation of conspiracy theories and hate speech , which she said requires more rigorous moderation . `` I hope that going forward , this subcommittee will focus on the real issues facing America , like hate speech , like voter suppression , like looking into the emoluments clause , '' noted Hirono .
Francesca Tripodi , a sociologist at James Madison University , testified that her research shows `` conservative content creators excel at search engine and social media optimization . ''
Throughout the hearing , Cruz focused heavily on pro-life sentiment , which has been at the center of the censorship dispute . The senator introduced a briefly blocked tweet from Marjorie Dannenfelser , president of the Susan B. Anthony List , which features a Mother Teresa quote characterizing abortion as `` profoundly anti-women . '' Monje said that pro-choice groups have had content removed when they , too , were in violation of Twitter 's policies—although what those policies are remains unclear .
He also rejected allegations that Twitter has a bias against any political ideology , referencing an internal study that found no statistically significant difference in the number of people that see tweets from Democrats versus Republicans .
Neil Potts , the public policy director at Facebook , also pushed back on the accusations of bias . `` We are committed to encouraging dialogue and the free flow of ideas , '' he said , citing a laundry list of internal efforts meant to ensure ideological diversity in content review efforts . `` We take that neutrality seriously . ''
But Cruz pressed Potts on Facebook 's stance against hate speech , raising concerns over the company 's history of removing posts that are deemed emotionally injurious .
Not all Republicans on the committee expressed a desire to monitor social media practices . `` I differ from some of my colleagues in the approach I take to this , '' said Sen. Mike Lee ( R–Utah ) . `` I do n't view you as a public utility . I do n't view you as being owned by the government , but some of my colleagues see it differently . '' Yet in a moment of cringeworthy political theatre , Lee angrily pressed both execs to concede that their respective companies are dominated by liberal employees . They almost certainly are , as both are based in Silicon Valley . But it 's information that neither is privy to .
The hearing likely accomplished very little—if anything—as Democrats and Republicans stood firm in their respective positions . Even so , they came to a rare area of agreement , with both sides calling for the tech giants to be more transparent .
`` To be sure , we must take seriously the fact that YouTube , Facebook , and Twitter play an increasingly important role in how our society gains access to news and information , '' said Tripodi . `` Unfortunately , the opaqueness of their operational tactics allow unsubstantiated conspiracies to hold weight . ''","Facebook and Twitter were in the spotlight again on Wednesday.

Throughout the hearing, Cruz focused heavily on pro-life sentiment, which has been at the center of the censorship dispute. The senator introduced a briefly blocked tweet from Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which features a Mother Teresa quote characterizing abortion as ""profoundly anti-women."" Monje said that pro-choice groups have had content removed when they, too, were in violation of Twitter's policies—although what those policies are remains unclear.

He also rejected allegations that Twitter has a bias against any political ideology, referencing an internal study that found no statistically significant difference in the number of people that see tweets from Democrats versus Republicans.

Neil Potts, the public policy director at Facebook, also pushed back on the accusations of bias. ""We are committed to encouraging dialogue and the free flow of ideas,"" he said, citing a laundry list of internal efforts meant to ensure ideological diversity in content review efforts. ""We take that neutrality seriously.""

But Cruz pressed Potts on Facebook's stance against hate speech, raising concerns over the company's history of removing posts that are deemed emotionally injurious.

Not all Republicans on the committee expressed a desire to monitor social media practices. ""I differ from some of my colleagues in the approach I take to this,"" said Sen. Mike Lee (R–Utah). ""I don't view you as a public utility. I don't view you as being owned by the government, but some of my colleagues see it differently."" Yet in a moment of cringeworthy political theatre, Lee angrily pressed both execs to concede that their respective companies are dominated by liberal employees. They almost certainly are, as both are based in Silicon Valley. But it's information that neither is privy to.

The hearing likely accomplished very little—if anything—as Democrats and Republicans stood firm in their respective positions. Even so, they came to a rare area of agreement, with both sides calling for the tech giants to be more transparent.

""To be sure, we must take seriously the fact that YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter play an increasingly important role in how our society gains access to news and information,"" said Tripodi. ""Unfortunately, the opaqueness of their operational tactics allow unsubstantiated conspiracies to hold weight.""",www.reason.com,center,pZ0X13a4ic79llxD

In a pair of critical First Amendment cases, the Court will soon decide whether the state can trample on citizens’ free-speech and conscience rights.

Today, we must pause and consider an important constitutional moment.

Earlier this morning the Supreme Court granted review in a case called National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Xavier Becerra. The issue is simple: Can the state of California require a pro-life crisis-pregnancy center to advertise the availability of free or reduced-cost abortions?

It’s an inherently punitive project, and often an unfair one (no one is the sum of their tweets). But the rules of this game were established by the Left long ago. It should either change them — or stop whining.

A handful of pro-Trump protesters were chased from a park in Berkeley, California, by counter-protesters clad in black garb and masks on Sunday, after a planned “No Marxism in America” rally fizzled out amid opposition and police pressure.



Organisers called off the rally, planned for Civic Center park, after police issued strict rules including searches for banned items such as weapons, helmets and even water bottles.

As in San Francisco on Saturday, when a planned rally was pushed out of the city by counter-protesters who threatened to use dog poo to make a venue unsuitable, hundreds of counter-protesters gathered nonetheless. Some carried signs that aimed to use humor against the racially charged invective that has marked such “free speech” rallies in cities including Berkeley.

“Viva Marx,” read signs held by protesters wearing thick, fake mustaches. “Berkeley stands with Groucho.” “Those poor fascists,” read another sign. “First they lose WWII and then Trump befriends them.”

Other protesters carried a giant rainbow with fluffy cotton clouds. Overhead, an airplane hauled a banner that read: “CA won’t tolerate hate.”

“This is, I think, the seventh rally that white supremacists have organized in our town square,” said Kim Anno, an artist who lives two blocks from the park. “They told us to ignore it. We ignored the first four rallies. Now we mean to stand up to it. We’re not just going to ignore it, because their numbers are growing.”

A small group of rightwing protesters gathered in the center of the park, regardless of the official cancellation. Three rows of barricades and dozens of police officers shielded them as, some wearing Trump campaign “Make America Great Again” caps, they conducted debates with small groups of counter-protesters.

Black-clad counter-protesters who chased the pro-Trump protesters also spotted and attacked with pepper spray Joey Gibson, the founder of the Patriot Prayer group who cancelled the San Francisco event on Saturday, the Associated Press reported. Police wearing riot gear set off smoke bombs to thwart the black-clad counter-protesters’ efforts, the AP said.

In San Francisco on Saturday, Mayor Ed Lee faced criticism from rightwing groups over his decision to police their planned event so heavily. He said people who wanted to speak needed to “contribute to people’s lives rather than find ways to hurt them”.



In Berkeley, residents have been arguing for months about how best to counter rightwing protests without resorting to violence.

On Sunday, two blocks to the east to the park and at the edge of the University of California campus, thousands of residents held a peaceful protest, closing Oxford Street.

“It’s interesting that these groups chose Berkeley to come stage these protests,” said Sevgo Fernandez, leader of a local group promoting racial equality. “If their intent is to bring about violence, we have to do something.”

In Xi Jinping’s China the question is no question. Government’s power is limitless. What the party says, goes: Got that?

The protests come after several days of escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran that started with the killing of an American contractor.

It's also the latest in a broader dispute between the two nations, including Trump's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear pact in 2018 and subsequent sanctions he imposed on Iran in order to make them come to a new deal.

Thousands of Iranians protested Friday against the U.S. airstrike in the capital of Tehran, shouting ""death to America."" Meanwhile, dozens of people in Iraq and Syria sang and danced to celebrate the general's death. Protests weren't confined to the U.S.

In Berlin, Germany, about 50 people demonstrated against U.S. actions, according to the Coalition Berlin, which co-organized the protest.

Oregon's largest city was calm and quiet Sunday after a day of chaotic, competing protests that clogged Portland streets, crippled public transit and left at least eight people injured.

Police in riot gear broke up the demonstrations as clashes developed among law enforcers, anti-fascist ""antifa"" protesters and right-wing groups. Three people were charged with crimes ranging from assault on a police officer to harassment, police said.

As the violence increased, police declared a civil disturbance and ordered the protests dispersed. Pepper spray was used by demonstrators and police, Assistant Chief Chris Davis said.

""Demonstration events are very fluid in nature and the management of these events is complex,"" Davis said late Saturday. ""There are hundreds of peaceful free speech events in the city in a given year that do not result in violence. Unfortunately, today some community members and officers were injured.""

The protests came a day after avowed white supremacist James Fields Jr. was sentenced to life in prison in Charlottesville, Virginia, for ramming his car into counter-protesters of a “Unite the Right” rally in 2017, killing one and injuring dozens more.

In Portland, Davis said officers were investigating several assaults during Saturday's protests and asked the public for help in identifying more suspects.

Andy Ngo, an editor with the conservative website ""Quillette,"" tweeted photos of cuts and bruises on his face. He said on Twitter he was hit multiple times with fists and weapons.

""Attacked by antifa. Bleeding,"" he tweeted. ""They stole my camera equipment. No police until after. waiting for ambulance. If you have evidence of attack please help.""

A Canadian professor questions a key tenet of current Leftist thinking .
Earlier this week , Professor Jordan Peterson of the University of Toronto burst into the international headlines again , this time thanks to a shockingly polite interview with British interviewer Cathy Newman . The entire interview was an insipid exercise in Newman attempting to cram her own words into Peterson ’ s mouth ; as Conor Friedersdorf of The Atlantic points out , Newman ’ s technique was to “ restate what [ Peterson ] said so as to make it seem as if [ his ] view is offensive , hostile , or absurd. ” Peterson , with the patience and mildness of a saint , doggedly refused to be boxed in that way .
But the segment of the interview that grabbed the public ’ s imagination wasn ’ t Peterson ’ s discussion of the wage gap or the biology of hierarchical relationships . It was a very simple exchange over the value of truth . Newman questioned Peterson on why he refused to go along with the trendy leftist cause du jour : using pronouns chosen by individuals rather than pronouns that describe their biology . “ Why should your freedom of speech trump a trans person ’ s right not to be offended ? ” Newman asked . Peterson , ever the gentleman , answered the question without guffawing : “ Because in order to be able to think , you have to risk being offensive . I mean , look at the conversation we ’ re having right now . You ’ re certainly willing to risk offending me in the pursuit of truth . Why should you have the right to do that ?

Newman misdirected : “ Well , I ’ m very glad I ’ ve put you on the spot. ” But Peterson pursued : “ Well , you get my point .

But you ’ re exercising your freedom of speech to certainly risk offending me , and that ’ s fine . More power to you , as far as I ’ m concerned . ”
But despite Peterson ’ s obvious logic , the Left refuses to concede this particular point . Any statement — any statement — must be gauged not only on the basis of its truth-value , according to the Left , but on the basis of whether such truth is likely to offend — or , at least , whether such truth is likely to offend groups the Left perceives as victimized .

But the segment of the interview that grabbed the public’s imagination wasn’t Peterson’s discussion of the wage gap or the biology of hierarchical relationships. It was a very simple exchange over the value of truth. Newman questioned Peterson on why he refused to go along with the trendy leftist cause du jour: using pronouns chosen by individuals rather than pronouns that describe their biology. “Why should your freedom of speech trump a trans person’s right not to be offended?” Newman asked.

Newman had no answer. Point to Peterson.

But despite Peterson’s obvious logic, the Left refuses to concede this particular point. Any statement — any statement — must be gauged not only on the basis of its truth-value, according to the Left, but on the basis of whether such truth is likely to offend — or, at least, whether such truth is likely to offend groups the Left perceives as victimized.

Yet his administration seems determined to demonstrate that suppression of opposing views is a bipartisan impulse .
Berkeley College Republicans ( BCR ) , which invited conservative commentator Ann Coulter to speak on campus this Thursday evening , and Young America 's Foundation ( YAF ) , which underwrote her visit , argue that Berkeley 's vague , unwritten policy regarding `` high-profile speakers '' unconstitutionally discriminates against unpopular viewpoints . As a result of that policy , which was adopted after violent protests prompted the university to shut down a February 1 appearance by former Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos , Berkeley canceled Coulter 's speech , then offered to reschedule it for next Tuesday afternoon , in the middle of the `` dead week '' between classes and exams .
BCR says it felt compelled to cancel an April 12 talk by another conservative journalist , David Horowitz , after the university insisted that it take place at an inconvenient location and end by 3 p.m. , meaning most students would be in class while Horowitz was speaking . BCR and YAF say the restrictions imposed by Berkeley in the name of public safety have not been applied to left-leaning speakers and amount to an `` unlawful heckler 's veto '' that marginalizes conservative voices .
After the Milo melee in February , Trump suggested on Twitter that Berkeley risks losing federal funds if it `` does not allow free speech . '' If the president were sincerely committed to protecting First Amendment rights , he would issue similar warnings to the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) , which recently demanded that Twitter reveal the identity of a DHS gadfly , and the Justice Department , which is considering criminal charges against people who share classified information leaked by others .

DHS dropped the summons the day after Twitter filed a lawsuit arguing that it threatened the First Amendment right to engage in pseudonymous political speech . Last week , in response to inquiries by Sen. Ron Wyden ( D-Ore. ) , DHS Inspector General John Roth revealed that his office is investigating whether the CBP summons was `` improper . ''
The day before Roth expressed concern about government inquiries that might have `` a chilling effect on individuals ' free speech rights , '' CNN and The Washington Post reported that the Justice Department is once again looking for a way to prosecute WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange for sharing classified documents with the public .

Trump said it was `` sad '' that the `` history and culture '' of the United States is `` being ripped apart '' by the removal of Confederate statues and monuments after ripping two GOP senators earlier in the morning over their criticism of his remarks this week blaming white supremacists and counterprotesters alike for Saturday 's violence .
It was a defiant move by a president who has come under fierce criticism , even from members of his own party , for not placing enough blame on white supremacists who marched through the Virginia college town on Saturday .
Yet in defending the Confederate statues , Trump could be seeking to consolidate support within at least a portion of his base , which has looked at the removal of Confederate statues and memorials with anger .
`` Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments , '' Trump tweeted . `` You ca n't change history , but you can learn from it .
`` Robert E Lee , Stonewall Jackson — who 's next , Washington , Jefferson ? So foolish ! Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities , towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced ! ''

... the beauty that is being taken out of our cities , towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) August 17 , 2017
The president 's tweets revived his claim on Tuesday that by removing Confederate statues , local governments and activists are `` changing history , you ’ re changing culture . ''
Efforts to remove memorials to the losing side in the Civil War have stepped up since hundreds of white supremacists descended on Charlottesville . The city of Baltimore overnight Tuesday took down four memorials . Another statue in Durham , N.C. , was pulled down by protestors .
In a defiant news conference on Tuesday , Trump defended those who gathered in Charlottesville last weekend to protest the city 's decision to take down a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee .
He suggested that allowing the statue 's removal could lead to the removal of other monuments to the country 's Founding Fathers , like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson .
Trump also appeared to equate counterprotesters with the white supremacists and neo-Nazi groups who incited violence in the college town Saturday .
The remarks disappointed many Republicans , who believed Trump was moving beyond the controversy on Monday with a statement blaming white supremacists and neo-Nazis specifically for their roles in Charlottesville 's violence .

It was a defiant move by a president who has come under fierce criticism, even from members of his own party, for not placing enough blame on white supremacists who marched through the Virginia college town on Saturday.

Yet in defending the Confederate statues, Trump could be seeking to consolidate support within at least a portion of his base, which has looked at the removal of Confederate statues and memorials with anger.

""Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,"" Trump tweeted. ""You can't change history, but you can learn from it.

""Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson — who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!""

...the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2017

The president's tweets revived his claim on Tuesday that by removing Confederate statues, local governments and activists are ""changing history, you’re changing culture.""

Efforts to remove memorials to the losing side in the Civil War have stepped up since hundreds of white supremacists descended on Charlottesville. The city of Baltimore overnight Tuesday took down four memorials. Another statue in Durham, N.C., was pulled down by protestors.

In a defiant news conference on Tuesday, Trump defended those who gathered in Charlottesville last weekend to protest the city's decision to take down a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.

He suggested that allowing the statue's removal could lead to the removal of other monuments to the country's Founding Fathers, like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.

Trump also appeared to equate counterprotesters with the white supremacists and neo-Nazi groups who incited violence in the college town Saturday.

The remarks disappointed many Republicans, who believed Trump was moving beyond the controversy on Monday with a statement blaming white supremacists and neo-Nazis specifically for their roles in Charlottesville's violence.

A resolution aimed at public universities addresses what amounts to growing government censorship.

In our age of hyper–political correctness, America’s colleges and universities are increasingly committing themselves to illiberal policies that clash directly with the freedoms of speech and expression guaranteed by the First Amendment. Representative Phil Roe (R., Tenn.) of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce hopes to do something about this. Roe recently introduced a resolution expressing the House’s sentiment against such policies and in favor of “protecting freedom of speech, thought, and expression at institutions of higher education.”

Roe’s resolution draws on several recent incidents that have illustrated the harms caused by public universities’ choosing to impinge on the Constitution.

Roe, who considers his resolution a “first step,” may ultimately have his eyes on strengthening the Higher Education Act of 1965, which was reauthorized in 2008.

free_speech,CBS News,0,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/no-clear-cut-outcome-for-supreme-courts-internet-free-speech-case/,No clear cut outcome for Supreme Court's Internet free speech case,,,"The nine justices on the Supreme Court gave no clear indication on Monday of how they might rule in a potentially significant case regarding free speech on the Internet .
Anthony Elonis was convicted of making threats of violence and sentenced to nearly four years in prison after posting hostile messages on Facebook about his community and his then-estranged wife , after she obtained a protective order against him . Elonis claims his threats were n't serious and that he was merely posting original rap lyrics . The conviction was a violation of his First Amendment right to freedom of speech , his lawyers argue .
The case is the first major test of free speech rights on the Internet , but the court 's eventual ruling could apply to more traditional forms of communication . ███ correspondent Jan Crawford reports that after hearing complicated and convoluted arguments from both Elonis ' lawyers and government lawyers , the justices seemed skeptical of both sides .
`` The justices were all over the place because this is a really complex issue , '' Crawford reported after the arguments . `` No one could tell you after this argument how the court is going to decide this case because I do n't think the justices know . ''
John Elwood , an attorney for Elonis , said after the arguments that he thought they went `` reasonably well '' but agreed the outcome would be `` very hard to tell . ''
He said that a victory for the government in this case could have far-reaching consequences for communications online , where the intent of one 's message is not always clear .
A sketch from the Supreme Court on Dec. 1 , 2014 , during arguments in Elonis v. United States , a case about free speech rights online . AP
`` Increasingly people who speak on the Internet , which is where much speech happens today ... could be held subject to felony liability not because they intended to , you know , threaten anybody but because somebody misinterpreted their comments as a threat , '' Elwood said . `` That is a risk on the Internet , where you 're frequently speaking to people , you know , without the context of tone of voice , body gestures , and frequently talking to people who you do n't even know in the physical world . ''
Jeff Dion , deputy executive director of the National Center for Victims of Crime , said after Monday 's arguments that the government made a strong case .
Throwing out Elonis ' conviction would effectively `` make a rulebook on how to legally threaten your spouse , '' Dion argued . Justice Samuel Alito indicated he agreed with that point , according to Scotusblog .
Should Elonis win , it would invalidate a majority of stalking statutes in the U.S. , Dion said .
If `` there is a requirement that the defendant actually intended to place the victim in fear , it could become much more difficult for the government ever to get a conviction for stalking , '' he said .
Stalking is a precursor crime which often leads to sexual assault and homicide , he pointed out . The majority of women who were murdered by current or former intimate partners were stalked in the 12 months preceding their death .
Paulette Sullivan Moore of the National Network to End Domestic Violence added that `` a threat is a threat , '' whether it comes via social media or otherwise .
`` If I leave the message on your windshield , or post it on your door , or post it on the Internet -- however I communicate , whatever medium I use to communicate the threat -- does n't make it any less a threat , '' she said .
According to Scotusblog , `` The Justices did not spend a lot of time analyzing whether the Internet was different from other forums of communications , [ although ] now and then a Justice would throw in a presumably knowing reference to Eminem or to rappers more generally . ''","The nine justices on the Supreme Court gave no clear indication on Monday of how they might rule in a potentially significant case regarding free speech on the Internet.

Elonis claims his threats weren't serious and that he was merely posting original rap lyrics. The conviction was a violation of his First Amendment right to freedom of speech, his lawyers argue.

The case is the first major test of free speech rights on the Internet, but the court's eventual ruling could apply to more traditional forms of communication. CBS News correspondent Jan Crawford reports that after hearing complicated and convoluted arguments from both Elonis' lawyers and government lawyers, the justices seemed skeptical of both sides.

""The justices were all over the place because this is a really complex issue,"" Crawford reported after the arguments. ""No one could tell you after this argument how the court is going to decide this case because I don't think the justices know.""

John Elwood, an attorney for Elonis, said after the arguments that he thought they went ""reasonably well"" but agreed the outcome would be ""very hard to tell.""

He said that a victory for the government in this case could have far-reaching consequences for communications online, where the intent of one's message is not always clear.

""Increasingly people who speak on the Internet, which is where much speech happens today... could be held subject to felony liability not because they intended to, you know, threaten anybody but because somebody misinterpreted their comments as a threat,"" Elwood said. ""That is a risk on the Internet, where you're frequently speaking to people, you know, without the context of tone of voice, body gestures, and frequently talking to people who you don't even know in the physical world.""

Jeff Dion, deputy executive director of the National Center for Victims of Crime, said after Monday's arguments that the government made a strong case.

Throwing out Elonis' conviction would effectively ""make a rulebook on how to legally threaten your spouse,"" Dion argued. Justice Samuel Alito indicated he agreed with that point, according to Scotusblog.

Should Elonis win, it would invalidate a majority of stalking statutes in the U.S., Dion said.

If ""there is a requirement that the defendant actually intended to place the victim in fear, it could become much more difficult for the government ever to get a conviction for stalking,"" he said.

Stalking is a precursor crime which often leads to sexual assault and homicide, he pointed out. The majority of women who were murdered by current or former intimate partners were stalked in the 12 months preceding their death.

Paulette Sullivan Moore of the National Network to End Domestic Violence added that ""a threat is a threat,"" whether it comes via social media or otherwise.

""If I leave the message on your windshield, or post it on your door, or post it on the Internet -- however I communicate, whatever medium I use to communicate the threat -- doesn't make it any less a threat,"" she said.

According to Scotusblog, ""The Justices did not spend a lot of time analyzing whether the Internet was different from other forums of communications, [although] now and then a Justice would throw in a presumably knowing reference to Eminem or to rappers more generally.""",www.cbsnews.com,left,9MiveUeeneUcsmhz

The suit alleged that Oz wrongly disparaged the corrupt olive oil industry .
The lawsuit was brought against Oz by an industry trade group , the New Jersey-based North American Olive Oil Association ( NAOOA ) , under Georgia 's so-called veggie libel law . It 's one of about a dozen states with these awful laws—which allow a party to sue for damages if a person allegedly disparages their agricultural products—on the books .

In the past decade , The New Yorker has dedicated at least two lengthy pieces to the issue of fraudulent olive oil . And Congress recently held hearings on the issue .

How does such fraud play out ? An olive oil might be misbranded , claiming to be of higher quality than it really is—from an earlier pressing , for example—or to be from one country but hail from another . Or it might be adulterated , containing—for example—a mix of olive oil and other less expensive food oils .
In fact , the NAOOA , which represents many foreign olive oil producers , whose products make up the bulk of the olive oil sold in the United States , is itself keen to identify and prevent such fraud in the industry . A 2015 report issued by the group , for example , raises `` significant questions '' about the quality of California olive oils tested by NAOOA .

That would be troubling enough , since Citizens United , which involved a film that was banned from TV because it was too critical of Hillary Clinton , simply recognized that Americans do not lose their First Amendment rights when they organize themselves in a disfavored way . But the so-called Democracy for All Amendment goes much further than nullifying one Supreme Court decision . It would radically rewrite the constitutional treatment of political speech , allowing Congress and state legislatures to impose any restrictions on election-related spending they consider reasonable .
`` To advance democratic self-government and political equality , and to protect the integrity of government and the electoral process , '' Section 1 says , `` Congress and the States may regulate and set reasonable limits on the raising and spending of money by candidates and others to influence elections . '' By allowing restrictions on money spent by anyone to influence elections , that provision would nullify a principle set forth in the landmark 1976 case Buckley v. Valeo .
In Buckley , the Supreme Court upheld the Federal Election Campaign Act 's limits on campaign contributions , which it said were justified by the desire to prevent `` corruption and the appearance of corruption .

Carper and Coons are not saying that every American should get an equal vote .

free_speech,The Week - News,1,http://theweek.com/articles/684166/illiberal-injustice-against-charles-murray,OPINION: The illiberal injustice against Charles Murray,2017-03-07,"Noah Millman, Kathryn Krawczyk, Brendan Morrow, Joel Mathis","The violent protests that greeted the conservative political scientist when he tried to speak at Middlebury College last week could be easily dismissed as the latest episode in the by-now tiresome campus speech wars . They should n't be . Murray is n't just another right-wing gadfly who enjoys provoking left-wing outrage . In a very real sense , if the left thinks he is n't worth debating , then one has to wonder who they think is .
The story sounds like one we 've heard before . Murray was invited to speak by a conservative campus student group . Protesters assembled to prevent him from speaking . They disrupted the speech to the point where it had to be canceled . Murray then repaired to a room to have his speech recorded so that those who wanted to hear it could do so . Protesters continued to disrupt the proceedings , and Murray was physically threatened as he attempted to leave the building . One of the professors who accompanied him was injured by the mob .
Murray 's account of the events makes for distressing reading , but one point he makes is worth reiterating : This has not been his experience with past protests . He notes that the college did all the right things in advance . They attempted to negotiate with the protesters to give them the opportunity to make their points while allowing the speech to continue . They arranged for the backup plan of recording the speech if the protests proved too disruptive . The college administration stood firmly and unequivocally for free speech and the marketplace of ideas . In his past experience , these have been adequate to ensure that protest was civil and did not ultimately prevent him from speaking . This time , that was n't enough .
Murray is no stranger to protest ; if he says something has changed , it 's worth taking him seriously . He is infamous primarily for his 1994 book The Bell Curve , which argued that IQ measured important differences in intelligence between individuals that were highly predictive of success across multiple dimensions , and because of this our society was becoming increasingly stratified by cognitive ability . The primary locus of the controversy around the book related to his comments on differences in IQ between racial and ethnic groups , which Murray believes to be at least partly innate .

Charles Murray deserved better.

The violent protests that greeted the conservative political scientist when he tried to speak at Middlebury College last week could be easily dismissed as the latest episode in the by-now tiresome campus speech wars. They shouldn't be. Murray isn't just another right-wing gadfly who enjoys provoking left-wing outrage. In a very real sense, if the left thinks he isn't worth debating, then one has to wonder who they think is.

The story sounds like one we've heard before. Murray was invited to speak by a conservative campus student group. Protesters assembled to prevent him from speaking. They disrupted the speech to the point where it had to be canceled. Murray then repaired to a room to have his speech recorded so that those who wanted to hear it could do so. Protesters continued to disrupt the proceedings, and Murray was physically threatened as he attempted to leave the building. One of the professors who accompanied him was injured by the mob.

Murray's account of the events makes for distressing reading, but one point he makes is worth reiterating: This has not been his experience with past protests. He notes that the college did all the right things in advance. They attempted to negotiate with the protesters to give them the opportunity to make their points while allowing the speech to continue. They arranged for the backup plan of recording the speech if the protests proved too disruptive. The college administration stood firmly and unequivocally for free speech and the marketplace of ideas. In his past experience, these have been adequate to ensure that protest was civil and did not ultimately prevent him from speaking. This time, that wasn't enough.

Murray is no stranger to protest; if he says something has changed, it's worth taking him seriously. He is infamous primarily for his 1994 book The Bell Curve, which argued that IQ measured important differences in intelligence between individuals that were highly predictive of success across multiple dimensions, and because of this our society was becoming increasingly stratified by cognitive ability. The primary locus of the controversy around the book related to his comments on differences in IQ between racial and ethnic groups, which Murray believes to be at least partly innate. It is understandable why such a view would invite a furious response. But the larger point about class stratification has only proved increasingly evident over time, and became the focus of his most recent book, Coming Apart. And with the election of Donald Trump, the cultural consequences of that stratification have powered the most astonishing political upheaval of our time.

All of which is to say: Murray is someone students need to hear from. He may be utterly wrong in his explanations for the phenomena he is studying. He may be thoroughly misguided in his proposed solutions. But he is asking questions that must be asked — and that must be asked in particular of a community of higher education which is a primary vehicle for the stratification he worries about.

Moreover, the concerns Murray is airing should be of particular interest to the left, which historically stands against the concentration of economic and political power, and against domination by a ruling class. If meritocracy and equality of opportunity does not increase social mobility and reduce class stratification, but the opposite, that would seem to be at least as powerful an argument for old-school left-wing solutions, like strong labor unions and the redistribution of wealth, as it is for Murray's own conservative libertarianism.

But that's why you have a debate.

Left-wingers should want to hear Murray — and hear what answers can be had from his analysis — more than conservatives should, because he is asking precisely the questions they need to answer. By ruling Murray unworthy of consideration, the radicals who protested him have not just traduced important norms related to free speech and civil respect (which would be bad enough), they have traduced those norms in the name of preserving themselves from having to question the institution they attend and its place in our society. A less-radical agenda than theirs is hard to imagine.

This is, of course, not a phenomenon limited to the left by any means. The same week that Murray was attacked at Middlebury, a bill was introduced into the Arkansas legislature to ban the work of radical historian Howard Zinn from public schools. But the right has an anti-liberal tradition to justify the notion that people should be ""protected"" from subversive, unpatriotic, or blasphemous views. And a right-wing legislator seeking to protect the existing power structure is at least acting in their own interest. The radical left is doing precisely the opposite.

At some point in an article like this, the writer typically says that they abjure Murray's abhorrent views but stand firmly for his right to air them, or that by engaging in violent and disruptive protest you merely turn him into a martyr and thereby enhance his stature rather than silencing him. And if I were writing about an odious troll like Milo Yiannopoulos, and I bothered to write an article about him at all, I might say something like that.

But I'm not going to say that about Charles Murray. He deserves to be debated not only because free speech belongs to everyone, but because he is asking absolutely vital questions.

Under pressure, Facebook and Google regulate content

The tech giants have implemented a series of internal changes in response to the outside pressure.

Changes have the effect of censoring and suppressing conservatives

Conservatives and Christians across YouTube have repeatedly seen their videos and channels demonetized or censored, especially within the last year.

The lawsuit was filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois by the advocacy group Speech First, which is based in Virginia. It names university President Timothy Kileen, the Board of Trustees, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and other school officials as defendants.

“As a public university, UIUC is bound to uphold the First Amendment, and these policies violate both the spirit and the letter of the law,” said Speech First President Nicole Neily.

The university said it had not yet received notification of the lawsuit.

“The University of Illinois is deeply committed to the core values of free speech and free expression and to the open exchange of competing ideas and perspectives,” a spokesman said in an email.

The lawsuit seeks injunctions to stop university officials from:

⦁ Prohibiting the distribution of noncampus campaign leaflets without prior approval.

⦁ Requiring Bias Assessment Response Teams (BARTs) to investigate claims of harmful language or action on campus.

⦁ Issuing “no-contact” directives against students who have been reported as offenders.

“[T]he University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and its officials have created a series of rules and regulations — along with an elaborate investigative and enforcement regime — designed to restrain, deter, suppress, and punish speech concerning political and social issues,” states the lawsuit, which was filed on behalf of four anonymous students.

Over the weekend , a group of neo-Nazis and white supremacists marched through Portland . Members of left-wing groups in black clothes showed up to confront them . Hundreds of non-masked counterprotesters came , too , along with 700 police officers . Ad Policy
The police far outnumbered both the Nazis and masked groups . They spent most of the day protecting the white supremacists—ushering them around the city , and even over a bridge closed to pedestrian and car traffic so they could escape the wrath of Portland residents . Portland police tweeted that they were there to “ protect everyone ’ s safety while facilitating everyone ’ s 1st Amendment right to gather and speak . It is the foundation of our democracy and critical to Portland ’ s identity . ”
Events like this one happen like clockwork these days : A small number of Nazis protest somewhere , usually under the guise of freely expressing their opinions , and the police protect them under a mandate of upholding the First Amendment . By bolstering the narrative that speech should be protected at all costs , the police , perhaps unwittingly , help smuggle white supremacist thought , policy , and action into the American mainstream . Conservatives and many liberals , on their part , lambast “ antifa ” for not respecting free speech . Trump even tweeted that antifa might be considered a terrorist organization for interrupting the supposed rights of white supremacists to march .
Over the last three years , I ’ ve been researching and writing a book about free speech in the United States—going to the front lines of free speech battles in Charlottesville and at other far-right protests , on college campuses , and at flashpoints of police repression like Standing Rock . What I ’ ve found through my research and reporting is that free speech has become a rhetorical tool to elide something much more sinister : the state ’ s support and protection of white supremacists , and this country ’ s unwillingness to grapple with its racism and vast inequality .
I ’ ve been disheartened to see not only conservatives and fascists but also liberals criticizing those who protest against the free speech rights of the most vile groups in America . The New York Times op-ed pages—really , every paper ’ s op-ed pages—have been filled with ostensible liberals warning that young , leftist , and progressive activists are pushing America toward fascism .
Their argument usually harks back to the oft-misattributed quote : “ I disapprove of what you say , but I will defend to the death your right to say it. ” Their reasoning makes clear that most of the United States has a deep misunderstanding of what free speech means .
Let ’ s start with the letter of the law : Nothing in the First Amendment prevents citizens ( members of antifa or otherwise ) from interrupting someone ’ s protest . Nor does it guarantee police protection for white nationalists . It only limits the ability of Congress from passing laws that interfere with speech . Current Issue View our current issue
Most leftists I talk to do not wish that the government would ban Nazi speech , as governments in Germany and France have . Instead , they wish that police departments would not spend vast amounts of resources protecting Nazis , something that they have no legal mandate to do . When the First Amendment is invoked by the Portland police and other government officials , they ’ re simply misinterpreting the law , or reinterpreting it to be extremely broad in a way that ’ s become acceptable largely thanks to decades of work on the part of right-wing think tanks .
The other problem with the state ’ s defense of Nazis ’ right to free speech is that it belies the fact that the state is itself suppressing speech in countless ways every day . We have already decided , for example , that private property rights supersede speech rights : I can not protest in a Walmart without being kicked out or arrested , and I can even be shot if I decide to protest in someone ’ s home in a Stand Your Ground state .
State and local governments have decided , and courts have upheld , that requiring permits for protests is an acceptable limit on free speech , and that requiring insurance for any possible damage caused by protests is too—often limiting legal protest to groups that can afford it .
And of course , there are many instances when police actively work against people ’ s ability to speak , whether it be at the January 20 , 2017 , protests during which hundreds of people were arrested and charged with felony rioting for being in the vicinity of some broken windows , or at Standing Rock , where police and federal forces broke up a peaceful demonstration at the behest of a private corporation .
How did we get here ? Very intentionally , as it turns out : For decades , the right has claimed a monopoly on the idea of “ freedom ” more broadly—and speech is no exception .
Until 2015 , the Koch brothers employed a man named Richard Fink as a political adviser . In 1996 Fink outlined his philosophy of conservative revolution in Philanthropy Monthly : First , you invest in the “ intellectual raw materials ” of national discourse—professorships , books , student groups . These institutions go on to produce ideas that , in a “ middle stage of production , ” think tanks disseminate in digestible forms to the public . Then , according to Fink , it ’ s the work of lobbyists and politicians to enact the final product : policy . In 1978 , another conservative policy man named William Simon , who headed the archconservative Olin Foundation , wrote that “ ideas are weapons ” that do not just naturally bloom : They must be funded through “ grants , grants , and more grants , in exchange for books , books , and more books. ” In other words , ideas were investments as worthy to the right-wing cause as political influence or corporate power .
These conservative influencers knew they couldn ’ t simply push for environmental deregulation or tax cuts for the rich , ideas that were at the time odious to much of the public . And some conservative intellectuals insisted that they needed to be disingenuous , to frame their arguments in universally appealing terms like “ freedom ” or “ prosperity , ” in order to win over Americans .
The best way to do this was to fund a long-term pipeline of academic research that would make its way into the mainstream . By 2015 , the Kochs were subsidizing programs in at least 307 higher education institutions like Brown University ’ s Political Theory Project and the Mercatus Center at George Mason University . The DeVos family ( led by the parents of the current secretary of education , Betsy DeVos ) also spent about $ 200 million on conservative education and research efforts , and helped found the James Madison Center for Free Speech , which was instrumental in defining money as a form of speech through the Citizens United ruling .
Fundamental to all these centers for research was a conflation of freedom for corporations to do whatever they want with political and First Amendment freedom . The billionaires pushed a version of free speech that posited that limiting carbon emissions , taxing the rich , and any form of redistribution were equivalent to infractions on our constitutional rights . To do this , they not only needed to talk about market and economic deregulation ; they needed to present their ideas as a radical remedy to the overbearing liberal state . So they funded dozens of books that argued that liberals were essentially limiting far-right speech through political correctness .
Welcome to the era of our supposed free speech crisis .
The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the publication of plenty of “ books , books , and more books ” that claimed conservative speech was being trampled on by the left . Most popular was Allan Bloom ’ s 1987 The Closing of the American Mind , which argued that college students no longer wanted to learn about American and European classics . Though the book ’ s scope was relatively narrow , it was used as a jumping-off point for a media onslaught of anti-PC takes , including a cover story in Newsweek called “ Thought Police ” and features in New York magazine and The New York Times claiming that college students were out to suppress anyone who didn ’ t agree with them .
Bloom ’ s scholarship was funded by the John M. Olin Center for Inquiry into the Theory and Practice of Democracy at the University of Chicago . It was straight out of the Kochs ’ raw material-to-public discourse pipeline .
Today , the same manufactured “ free speech crisis ” can be seen across the United States , with conservative groups funded by the same people claiming their rights have been similar infringed upon on college campuses . The same groups have bankrolled provocateurs like Milo Yiannopoulos , and fund media outlets like Breitbart News whose coverage accentuates these supposed violations . Meanwhile , the mainstream media , along with many liberals , takes the conservatives at their word , not realizing it ’ s playing a part in a multi-decade campaign to frame conservatives and white supremacists as victims , as opposed to perpetrators of hate .
The billion-dollar investment in what is essentially right-wing propaganda has worked : We no longer think of free speech logically or accurately . Is a college protest over a conservative speaker really a violation of free speech ? What about the college students ’ right to protest—is that not as important a free speech issue ? Colleges are already some of the most restrictive speech environments in the world , deciding who can enter the campus via an admissions process , what gets taught in every classroom , and who gets to teach it .
Is my rejection from UC Berkeley a free speech violation ? I might disagree with their decision , but no , it ’ s not . I don ’ t expect to be invited to conservative Christian universities , and I don ’ t view that as a violation of my free speech either . Why should conservatives expect an open invitation wherever they please ? And more importantly , why are so many liberals defending them ?
Similarly : Are counterprotests and antifa tactics a violation of free speech ? We limit protest all the time , and give the state permission to limit the speech of countless people without much of a fuss . I ’ d argue , for example , that mass incarceration and the disappearing of immigrants is a much bigger threat to free speech than the confrontation of Nazis on the streets .
Even if you do believe that antifa ’ s tactics amount to a free speech violation , you must then question why those violations retain your attention–and the ire of the political establishment and the mainstream media—while so many other limits on free speech have gotten a pass . Is it because they are the most important free speech battles in the country—or because we ’ ve been convinced , through decades of ingenious campaigning , to believe they are ?","Ready to fight back?

Barton Hinkle, Scott Shackford, David Post, Josh Blackman, Shikha Dalmia, Jacob Sullum, Elizabeth Nolan Brown, Eric Boehm, Ilya Somin, Mike Riggs","Last week the Department of Homeland Security 's Customs and Border Protection division demanded that Twitter reveal the identity of the person behind an account that has been criticizing the Trump administration . The agency had no authority to issue such a demand , and quickly retracted it . But you could not have scripted a better incident to confirm the worst fears of Trump administration critics about its neo-fascist tendencies .
As a Washington Post story last week noted , Twitter 's `` primary objection , the company said , is that allowing the government to unmask Twitter critics violates the Constitution 's First Amendment right to free speech… That right , the company said , is particularly important when discussing political speech . 'First Amendment interests are at their zenith when , as here , the speech at issue touches on matters of public political life , ' [ Twitter 's court ] filing said . ''
Twitter fretted that the demand `` may reflect the very sort of official retaliation that can result from speech that criticizes government officials and agencies . ''
Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden ( Ore. ) called the DHS demand a `` witch hunt . '' In a letter to CPB , he pronounced himself `` gravely alarmed '' by an apparent attempt to `` squelch the exercise of First Amendment rights to comment on U.S. policy , and to make those comments anonymously . ''
The case was `` about the broader right to speak anonymously on the internet , '' said Esha Bhandari , a staff lawyer with the ACLU . In a subsequent statement , she told The Washington Post , `` Speaking anonymously about issues of the day is a longstanding American tradition , dating back to when the framers of the Constitution wrote under pseudonyms . The anonymity that the First Amendment guarantees is often most essential when people criticize the government , and this free speech right is as important today as ever . ''
Alex Howard , deputy director of the Sunlight Foundation , praised Twitter 's rebuff of the CBP demand : `` The choices they made to stand up for their users set important precedents for other companies now and into the future . ''
This is all very good to hear , especially in light of the hand-wringing over `` dark money '' in political campaigns . Dark money consists of donations to groups such as Americans for Prosperity , the League of Conservation Voters , and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund . Those politically oriented nonprofit groups can use the money for independent expenditures urging the public to vote for or against a political candidate .
Dark-money expenditures have increased in recent years , but they still represent only a tiny fraction of total campaign spending . The vast majority of the money—more than 90 percent—gets spent by candidates , political parties , and groups formed to support specific candidates .
Nevertheless , `` dark money '' sounds despicable . It summons images of robber barons twirling their mustaches as they plot world domination—even though it is just as likely to be spent by NARAL Pro-Choice America or the Environmental Defense Action Fund .
Because it sounds awful , it has elicited calls for `` disclosure . '' Legislation has been introduced in Congress and in more than half the states that would require such incorporated nonprofits to disclose their donors . One New York proposal would require nonprofits to disclose the identities of anyone who gave them more than $ 1,000 if they express any opinion about any position taken on any issue by any candidate , legislature , or executive agency . If Friends of the Earth says State Sen. Smith is wrong to support fracking , the group would have to reveal the identity of all its donors , submit internal communications to the government for review , and more .
Right : Ron Wyden . The senator says he was proud to sponsor legislation that `` would require all entities that engage in election-related activity to report their significant donors . ''
And the Sunlight Foundation , which wants Congress to pass the DISCLOSE Act , which it says would require `` secretive nonprofits '' to reveal the names of significant donors , unless those donors specify that their money ca n't be used for political purposes .
To its credit , the ACLU has criticized dark-money disclosure laws , at least those like the one in New York , as overly broad measures that `` could chill constitutionally protected speech . ''
Campaign-finance reformers like to pretend their concern has to do with money , especially corporate money—not political speech . But it 's impossible to separate the two . When NARAL Pro-Choice America blasts a Republican for his stance on abortion rights , it spends money to do so . The money is n't speech . But it makes the speech possible , and you ca n't limit the expenditure without limiting the speech too—any more than you could cap the amount of money spent on abortions without limiting abortion rights .
Indeed , that 's precisely the question that lay at the heart of the Supreme Court 's widely reviled , and even more widely misunderstood , ruling in Citizens United : whether the government could stop a non-profit corporation from publishing criticism of a politician in the weeks leading into an election .
Twitter is a for-profit corporation that recently published criticism of a politician by the name of Donald Trump . Let 's hope those who were horrified by the administration 's demand that the user be unmasked think long and hard about whether they want the government unmasking other critics , too .","Last week the Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection division demanded that Twitter reveal the identity of the person behind an account that has been criticizing the Trump administration. The agency had no authority to issue such a demand, and quickly retracted it.

Civil libertarians were—quite properly—outraged.

Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden (Ore.) called the DHS demand a ""witch hunt."" In a letter to CPB, he pronounced himself ""gravely alarmed"" by an apparent attempt to ""squelch the exercise of First Amendment rights to comment on U.S. policy, and to make those comments anonymously.""

The case was ""about the broader right to speak anonymously on the internet,"" said Esha Bhandari, a staff lawyer with the ACLU. In a subsequent statement, she told The Washington Post, ""Speaking anonymously about issues of the day is a longstanding American tradition, dating back to when the framers of the Constitution wrote under pseudonyms. The anonymity that the First Amendment guarantees is often most essential when people criticize the government, and this free speech right is as important today as ever.""

Alex Howard, deputy director of the Sunlight Foundation, praised Twitter's rebuff of the CBP demand: ""The choices they made to stand up for their users set important precedents for other companies now and into the future.""

This is all very good to hear, especially in light of the hand-wringing over ""dark money"" in political campaigns. Dark money consists of donations to groups such as Americans for Prosperity, the League of Conservation Voters, and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. Those politically oriented nonprofit groups can use the money for independent expenditures urging the public to vote for or against a political candidate.

Dark-money expenditures have increased in recent years, but they still represent only a tiny fraction of total campaign spending. The vast majority of the money—more than 90 percent—gets spent by candidates, political parties, and groups formed to support specific candidates.

Nevertheless, ""dark money"" sounds despicable. It summons images of robber barons twirling their mustaches as they plot world domination—even though it is just as likely to be spent by NARAL Pro-Choice America or the Environmental Defense Action Fund.

Because it sounds awful, it has elicited calls for ""disclosure."" Legislation has been introduced in Congress and in more than half the states that would require such incorporated nonprofits to disclose their donors. One New York proposal would require nonprofits to disclose the identities of anyone who gave them more than $1,000 if they express any opinion about any position taken on any issue by any candidate, legislature, or executive agency. If Friends of the Earth says State Sen. Smith is wrong to support fracking, the group would have to reveal the identity of all its donors, submit internal communications to the government for review, and more.

And guess who supports such disclosure?

Right: Ron Wyden. The senator says he was proud to sponsor legislation that ""would require all entities that engage in election-related activity to report their significant donors.""

And the Sunlight Foundation, which wants Congress to pass the DISCLOSE Act, which it says would require ""secretive nonprofits"" to reveal the names of significant donors, unless those donors specify that their money can't be used for political purposes.

To its credit, the ACLU has criticized dark-money disclosure laws, at least those like the one in New York, as overly broad measures that ""could chill constitutionally protected speech.""

Campaign-finance reformers like to pretend their concern has to do with money, especially corporate money—not political speech. But it's impossible to separate the two. When NARAL Pro-Choice America blasts a Republican for his stance on abortion rights, it spends money to do so. The money isn't speech. But it makes the speech possible, and you can't limit the expenditure without limiting the speech too—any more than you could cap the amount of money spent on abortions without limiting abortion rights.

Indeed, that's precisely the question that lay at the heart of the Supreme Court's widely reviled, and even more widely misunderstood, ruling in Citizens United: whether the government could stop a non-profit corporation from publishing criticism of a politician in the weeks leading into an election.

Twitter is a for-profit corporation that recently published criticism of a politician by the name of Donald Trump. Let's hope those who were horrified by the administration's demand that the user be unmasked think long and hard about whether they want the government unmasking other critics, too.

Fans of the internet ’ s contrarian wing don ’ t want Patreon taking a cut of the money they send to their heroes for premium content and have stopped making pledges .
The boycott may be hurting Patreon ’ s bottom line , but it ’ s also hurting personalities like right-wing author Jordan Peterson , comedian Dave Rubin , and other big names—who have resorted to begging their acolytes to keep the cash coming or are looking for another way to raise money .
Peterson , for his part , in a video posted online Sunday , begged his fans to be “ reasonably patient ” and keep up the monthly payments they send him through the crowdfunding site .
“ It ’ s not so good for me on the financial front , ” said Peterson , who lost nearly 10 percent of his Patreon supporters over the past week .
“ My business side is going : that ’ s not great , ” Rubin added in the same video .
Peterson , Rubin , and other pillars of the Intellectual Dark Web , an amorphous group of conservative internet political personalities defined by their willingness to buck political correctness and tweak liberals , have seen their Patreon payments battered this month by a controversy starring one of their movement ’ s own members .
Now Intellectual Dark Webbers like Rubin and Peterson are faced with a tough choice .
They can follow their fans and leave Patreon , abandoning the platforms that earns them each hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in exchange for another crowdfunding platform that could be shut down at any moment . Or they can stay , and risk being branded as sellouts to their free speech-obsessed fanbases .
The Intellectual Dark Web ’ s Patreon gravy train is under threat over Patreon ’ s treatment of Carl Benjamin , a pugnacious right-wing personality who poses as ancient Mesopotamian ruler “ Sargon of Akkad ” online . On Dec. 7 , Patreon banned Benjamin , who was making more than $ 12,000 a month on the platform .
Patreon kicked Benjamin off for “ racist and homophobic slurs , ” an apparent reference to a February rant in which Benjamin called his foes on the extreme right “ niggers ” and “ faggots . ”
Peterson , Benjamin , and Rubin , as well as Patreon ’ s press office , didn ’ t respond to requests for comment .
Benjamin ’ s supporters on the right have mostly ignored his hate speech , framing him instead as just the latest right-wing figure to be kicked off a tech platform over his politics .
Despite his use of racial and homophobic slurs , Benjamin ’ s friends in the Intellectual Dark Web have cast him as a martyr to free speech . Peterson , who has been lauded in mainstream outlets like the New York Times , called Benjamin “ a brave guy ” and said he was “ extremely upset ” by the ban .
On Sunday night , “ new atheist ” author and Intellectual Dark Web figure Sam Harris , who had one of Patreon ’ s highest-earning accounts until Monday , said that he was quitting the fundraising platform over recent Patreon bans .
`` These recent expulsions seem more readily explained by political bias , ” Harris said in a statement .
Benjamin ’ s ouster left fans of the Intellectual Dark Web urging other personalities like Rubin and Peterson to quit Patreon , too . But their options are limited .

That puts SubscribeStar in the same spot as other crowdfunding sites that have courted the extreme right , only to be banned from the major financial tech platforms . Over the weekend , SubscribeStar stopped accepting new members .
Other personalities are attempting to raise money through membership programs of their own . Some have urged their fans to just send them money directly through PayPal , while Harris has directed his thousands of Patreon subscribers to sign up to pay for his content through his own website .

“ We have not been sleeping on this front , man , ” Peterson said in a video . “ People are trying to figure out what to do so this stops happening . ”

In fact , people are less willing to discuss important issues on social media , than they are in real life , a new report from Pew Research Center has found .
It may seem like an obvious conclusion : of course , people are more hesitant to speak up with a contrary opinion when all their friends , family or colleagues feel differently . But there ’ s been little research that quantifies just how unwilling people are to take a potentially unpopular stance on outlets like Facebook and Twitter .
Pew refers to the this tendency to keep opinions to yourself , when you believe they ’ re not widely shared , as the “ spiral of silence ” – a term coined in the mid-70 ’ s by a researcher studying the nature of public opinion .
“ Some social media creators and supporters have hoped that social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter might produce different enough discussion venues that those with minority views might feel freer to express their opinions , thus broadening public discourse and adding new perspectives to everyday discussion of political issues , ” explains Pew .
But as it turns out that optimistic desire is not quite the reality . If anything , social media is encouraging users to keep opinions to themselves .
In its study , Pew focused on the controversial topic involving Edward Snowden ’ s revelations of widespread government surveillance , because that topic saw a variety of opinions across the U.S. as to whether his actions were justified , and whether the government ’ s policies themselves were good or bad .
Only 42 % of users said they were willing to discuss the surveillance program on social media , while a much larger 86 % were willing to have an in-person discussion about it . Meanwhile , the 14 % who were unwilling to discuss the topic in person didn ’ t turn to social media as a backup – only 0.3 % did .
This , explains the report , “ challenges the notion that social media spaces might be considered useful venues for people sharing views they would not otherwise express when they are in the physical presence of others . ”
And in both online and offline discussions , people were more willing to share their views if they believed their audience agreed with them . For instance , if someone believed their Facebook network agreed with them , they were twice as likely to join a discussion about the issue .
But here ’ s the kicker : not only did social media silence users online , or fail to be a place where they could more freely discuss topics when they couldn ’ t do so with real-world friends , it also seemed to change people ’ s offline behavior , making them less willing to engage in potentially controversial discussions .
Social media users , says Pew , were less willing to share their opinions in face-to-face settings than others . The typical Facebook user was half as likely to have a discussion about the topic in the offline world , while Twitter users were 0.24 times less likely to do the same .
Of course , it ’ s worth pointing out that the choice to use the Snowden situation as the basis for this particular study could be flawed – after all , social platforms , including Facebook , were implicated as being among the places the government tapped to listen in on citizens ’ conversations . Perhaps citizens didn ’ t want to publicize an opinion on this particular matter , but would be more willing to do so on others .
The study , for what it ’ s worth , didn ’ t get into the “ why ” question regarding people ’ s decision to stay silent , but theorized it could be attributed to a number of factors , including not wanting to disappoint or get into arguments with friends or post things that HR departments or prospective employers could one day discover . Plus , Pew says that an individual ’ s decision to share an opinion could also relate to their confidence and understanding of the subject as well as how intense or apathetic they felt .
Because of its sample methods ( 1,801 people via survey ) and choice of topic , Pew ’ s study might not be a fully accurate example of social media ’ s silencing effects , but it ’ s definitely fodder for discussion – if you dare ! – as well as further research .","Social media is not living up to its promise of being an online outlet for discussion that mirrors our communications and conversations that take place in the offline world.

President Donald Trump, addressing his 53.8 million Twitter followers, charged Saturday that social media discriminates against Republican and conservative voices and that his administration would not let that happen.

""They are closing down the opinions of many people on the RIGHT, while at the same time doing nothing to others,"" he said on Twitter. He did not specify who ""they"" are.

""Speaking loudly and clearly for the Trump Administration, we won’t let that happen,"" he said.

The president did not elaborate on how the government might intervene.

His Saturday morning tweets follow a week in which Apple, Facebook, Spotify and YouTube have removed shows and video posted by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Twitter suspended Jones from its platform for a week.

In response to continued calls for Twitter to ban Jones from the site , Dorsey bluntly explained why Twitter has not joined Apple , Facebook , YouTube , and many other companies in barring Jones for disseminating hate speech , among other things . In a lengthy thread , Dorsey not only maintained that Jones has not violated any of Twitter ’ s policies but framed the backlash against Jones as “ political ” and suggested that it ’ s up to the news media , not Twitter staff , to police accounts like Jones ’ s that “ sensationalize issues and spread unsubstantiated rumors . ”
It ’ s a sobering read — but much more for what it says about Twitter than for what it says about Jones .
Jones is currently facing a precedent-setting lawsuit brought by the parents of a child who died in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting , who ’ ve experienced years of harassment due to a conspiracy theory Jones popularized which argues that the shooting never happened and that the victims ’ parents are “ crisis actors. ” In response to growing public contempt of him , Apple , Facebook , Spotify , YouTube , Stitcher , and even Pinterest and MailChimp have all summarily banned Jones and Infowars from their platforms , citing various violations of their content policies ranging from child endangerment to harassment .
Jones ’ s collective ouster has left him with only one major online refuge : Twitter , where he has 800,000 followers . Twitter , however , has taken a strikingly different — and hands-off —approach to mitigating Jones and his content .
This response is breathtakingly amoral , as well as regressive , terrible decision-making — for Twitter , for the internet , for all of us . It should be a moment of reckoning for everyone who uses Twitter . Let ’ s break down why .
Dorsey ’ s statement is a startling attempt to frame Twitter as an apolitical neutral party
In Dorsey ’ s thread , which immediately drew intense backlash , he effectively stated that Twitter will not get involved in “ political ” debates , and that it ’ s up to the news media and other users , not social media companies , to police accounts like Jones ’ s .
We didn ’ t suspend Alex Jones or Infowars yesterday . We know that ’ s hard for many but the reason is simple : he hasn ’ t violated our rules . We ’ ll enforce if he does . And we ’ ll continue to promote a healthy conversational environment by ensuring tweets aren ’ t artificially amplified . — jack ( @ jack ) August 8 , 2018
Truth is we ’ ve been terrible at explaining our decisions in the past . We ’ re fixing that . We ’ re going to hold Jones to the same standard we hold to every account , not taking one-off actions to make us feel good in the short term , and adding fuel to new conspiracy theories . — jack ( @ jack ) August 8 , 2018
If we succumb and simply react to outside pressure , rather than straightforward principles we enforce ( and evolve ) impartially regardless of political viewpoints , we become a service that ’ s constructed by our personal views that can swing in any direction . That ’ s not us . — jack ( @ jack ) August 8 , 2018
Accounts like Jones ' can often sensationalize issues and spread unsubstantiated rumors , so it ’ s critical journalists document , validate , and refute such information directly so people can form their own opinions . This is what serves the public conversation best . — jack ( @ jack ) August 8 , 2018
In addition to Dorsey ’ s thread , Twitter ’ s Safety team issued its own lengthy statement attempting to clarify the site ’ s content policies and how they do or do not apply with regard to Jones . Most significant was its assertion that Twitter can not be “ the arbiter of truth ” around what is and isn ’ t false information .
As we have stated publicly , we strongly believe Twitter should not be the arbiter of truth nor do we have scalable solutions to determine and action what ’ s true or false . — Twitter Safety ( @ TwitterSafety ) August 7 , 2018
This is all a lot to unpack , and it touches on many aspects of the cultural conversation that has centered on social media , and Twitter specifically , over the past two years — including the proliferation of fake news , Twitter ’ s lackluster attempts to “ ban the Nazis , ” and the question of whether sites like Twitter and Facebook are publishers who are ethically responsible for the content they serve readers .
But above all , Dorsey ’ s and Twitter ’ s statements seem to be a striking reversal of the site ’ s previous progress . The company ’ s approach to disruptive elements and abusive users ranging from run-of-the-mill trolls to well-established hate groups has always been haphazard and inconsistent at best . But until now , the company has at least presented itself as generally committed to fighting the good fight in quashing those elements on the site .
What ’ s most jarring — and disturbing — about Dorsey ’ s statement is its latent suggestion that all of Twitter ’ s progress has been a mistake . Instead , it seems to insist that the better approach should be a hands-off one , which pretends the major issues the website faces in 2018 are not inherently and irreparably politicized .
In essence , Twitter is choosing to treat the question of whether Alex Jones ’ s presence on the site is harmful as an issue of semantics rather than an issue of morality .
Twitter is actively choosing to ignore Jones ’ s long history of hate and harassment
Jones and Infowars ’ content is built around far-right extremism and conspiracy theories . His shows are frequently loaded with Islamophobia , anti-Semitism , racism , homophobia , and sexism . Many of Jones ’ s followers take his words very seriously , and they often respond by harassing his perceived enemies , on and off the internet .
The parents of Noah Pozner , a 6-year-old killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting , have had to move seven times in five years in an attempt to evade harassment from people who believe the shooting never happened . Jones also propagated the 2016 Pizzagate conspiracy , which culminated in a man invading a Washington , DC , pizza joint with an AR-15 assault rifle because he believed Hillary Clinton had organized a pedophilia ring there .
And apart from the dangerous real-life harassment that has arisen as a consequence of Jones ’ s broadcasts , there ’ s the harassment that Jones initiates himself . Less than two weeks ago , Jones appeared to threaten FBI special counsel Robert Mueller during a broadcast of The Alex Jones Show , saying Mueller was “ a demon I will take down , or I ’ ll die trying . ... It ’ s not a joke . It ’ s not a game . It ’ s the real world . Politically . You ’ re going to get it , or I ’ m going to die trying , bitch . ”
In short , Jones ’ s platform is a well-established conduit for hate and harassment . Ignoring that fact is disingenuous , and in doing so , Twitter is suggesting it would rather profit from Jones — by being the only major internet platform to continue to host him , thus gaining a chance to draw new users and combat its extremely flat user growth — than treat Jones as a disruptive and dangerous figure .
This is in direct contrast to the actions it ’ s taken in the recent past . Though Twitter has been utterly inconsistent — okay , more like whiplash-inducing — in confronting multiple leading alt-right and white supremacist figures on its platforms , we have plenty of examples of Twitter dealing with members belonging to or affiliated with hate groups . Less than a year ago , it even established a clear precedent for how to deal with hate groups and individuals affiliating themselves with such groups — a process that included looking at their behavior both on and offline .
Twitter could easily choose to frame Infowars as a nexus of hate speech , in which case it would have a clear reason to ban Jones and his networks . Instead , it has chosen to ignore the harm Jones has done , off platform , on platform , and in the real world .
By framing the backlash against Jones as solely political , Twitter is washing its hands of the fight against fake news and fake reality
If we succumb and simply react to outside pressure , rather than straightforward principles we enforce ( and evolve ) impartially regardless of political viewpoints , we become a service that ’ s constructed by our personal views that can swing in any direction .
This suggests that political viewpoints and unsourced lies made up for political reasons are the same thing . They are not .
No one should need to explain this , let alone in response to the CEO of Twitter , but not all conservative thinkers are conspiracists . What ’ s more , there are endless reasons to fight against Jones ’ s warped version of reality , which is built on lie after lie , that have nothing to do with politics .
Even more disturbing is that Dorsey and Twitter are trying to frame the site ’ s position as a principled one — as a morally upright stance it is adopting to avoid “ taking one-off actions to make us feel good in the short term , and adding fuel to new conspiracy theories. ” The idea here seems to be that if Twitter bans Jones in haste , it would give credence to his followers ’ already pervasive paranoia . But a ) that ’ s bullshit — you don ’ t create two conspiracies by stamping one out ; and b ) guarding against the distortion of reality is not a political agenda , and to suggest otherwise is incredibly dangerous .
And then there ’ s the issue of Dorsey ’ s attempt to leave the policing of reality in the hands of journalists and users rather than Twitter staff . As multiple journalists have already noted , that idea rejects all the work that professional journalists do daily to combat unsourced lies and fake news — precisely so that companies like Twitter can respond to and act on their information .
As pundit Jon Lovett noted , it also sounds like a recipe for the Twitter experience to become absolutely miserable .
You know @ jack , I like twitter . It ’ s addicting and can be harmful . But I see the good in it . You say it ’ s up to us to police the endless malicious lies of your worst users . OK . Does that sound fun ? Does that sound like a place people will want to spend their time ? — Jon Lovett ( @ jonlovett ) August 8 , 2018
And as journalist Caroline Moss made abundantly clear , individual Twitter users can ’ t police reality against people who are determined to disbelieve anything they say in its defense .
Hey @ jack did I do this right pic.twitter.com/OafLJsO12F — Caroline Moss ( @ socarolinesays ) August 8 , 2018
It should be noted that Dorsey ’ s response doesn ’ t just consign everyone who uses Twitter to having to deal with Jones and people like Jones ; it consigns them to deal with the spread of fake news across the platform . And given that fake news travels faster than real news on Twitter , any policy decision that involves the company choosing not to fight that spread could deeply impact Twitter culture .
Earlier this week , Siva Vaidhyanathan , the author of Antisocial Media , gave an interview that seems deeply prophetic just days later . Asked what we can do to combat “ misinformation and lies and hate speech on our social media platforms , ” he responded , “ nothing ” :
There is nothing “ we ” can do , as in you and me , and nothing that Twitter or Facebook would do to fix the situation for two reasons . One , anything that would effectively cleanse Facebook and Twitter of harmful material would put such a heavy burden on what are fairly small staffs [ relative to the companies ’ size ] and violate their core founding principles ... One , to provide everyone a voice , and two , to remain neutral between contested positions . ... This problem [ of hate speech online ] — and that ’ s too light a word — reveals that social media was a bad idea in the first place , and there really is no fixing it ! If we want social media as it ’ s been imagined and constructed , we have to live with this garbage . And we have to accept that Facebook and Twitter will be vulnerable to sabotage and pollution as long as we have it .
Vaidhyanathan went on to say that if we want Twitter to make meaningful changes , we must communicate that in the classic way — by “ sham [ ing ] its advertisers ” and “ limit [ ing ] its distribution. ” In response to Dorsey on Tuesday night , it seemed some Twitter users were already taking this approach :
# Twitter is a private company and it ’ s 100 % your choice whether or not to enforce your rules against targeted abuse ( which Infowars violates ) . Just like it ’ s our choice as private consumers whether or not to boycott all your fucking advertisors . # Twitler pic.twitter.com/GPYu4oL6DG — ÆMarling ( @ AEMarling ) August 8 , 2018
In effect , Twitter is at a moral crossroads — and choosing the wrong path . The choice to allow Jones and his rhetoric to remain active on the platform suggests that there is no point at which a situation will become morally reprehensible enough for the company to take a stand .
Anyone who ’ s followed Twitter ’ s actions in the past two years can easily see how the site has walked a very thin ethical line during Donald Trump ’ s presidency , one that allows it to pay court to racists and fascists while occasionally appeasing those who protest . And that ’ s an appalling , unacceptable truth , but it ’ s one that many of us have generally come to accept and expect — probably because we simply lack the stamina to be as perpetually outraged as we should by the fact that we have to share so much of the world with actual Nazis .
But Jones represents what is perhaps the clearest opportunity to draw a moral line that Twitter will ever have . Forget the Nazis for a second ; Alex Jones is a man who has seen his followers harass the parents of dead 6-year-olds and continued to egg them on , using the completely fabricated claim that these parents ’ grief is just an act .
There is nothing redeemable here ; there ’ s no useful idea , no political concept worth debating — there ’ s only a lie told purely in order to spread harm , confusion , disorder , and pain .
Jones is sound and fury , signifying nothing . Twitter ’ s choice to defend his place on its site , however , signifies everything about what Twitter is choosing to be .

Two important cases will be argued before the U.S. Supreme Court today . One of them involves a high-stakes , high-tech battle that has raised the possibility of major TV networks no longer broadcasting over the air . The other case involves the future of lying in political campaigns . Here 's NPR 's legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg .
NINA TOTENBERG , BYLINE : Is there a constitutional right to lie ? Ohio and about a third of all the states have laws that make certain kinds of campaign lies illegal . The Buckeye State version imposes potential fines on organizations convicted of violating the law . During the 2010 midterm elections , the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List wanted to put up a billboard ad targeting then-Congressman Steven Driehaus or his vote on the Affordable Care Act .
The ad said , quote , `` Shame on Steve Driehaus . Driehaus voted for taxpayer-funded abortions . '' In fact , Driehaus and other anti-abortion Democrats supported the Obama health care bill only after the president agreed to issue an executive order that specified tax dollars could not be used for abortion except in cases of rape , incest or to save the life of the woman .
Driehaus filed a complaint with the Ohio Elections Commission , and the commission found probable cause of a violation . But the ad never went up because the advertising company that owned the billboard space refused to allow it . Driehaus subsequently lost his reelection bid , and his complaint to the state elections commission was withdrawn . The Susan B.

The Supreme Court on Tuesday hears arguments in two high-profile cases that could affect video sharing on the Internet, and the telling of untruths in the political marketplace.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

Two important cases will be argued before the U.S. Supreme Court today. One of them involves a high-stakes, high-tech battle that has raised the possibility of major TV networks no longer broadcasting over the air. The other case involves the future of lying in political campaigns. Here's NPR's legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg.

NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: Is there a constitutional right to lie? Ohio and about a third of all the states have laws that make certain kinds of campaign lies illegal. The Buckeye State version imposes potential fines on organizations convicted of violating the law. During the 2010 midterm elections, the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List wanted to put up a billboard ad targeting then-Congressman Steven Driehaus or his vote on the Affordable Care Act.

The ad said, quote, ""Shame on Steve Driehaus. Driehaus voted for taxpayer-funded abortions."" In fact, Driehaus and other anti-abortion Democrats supported the Obama health care bill only after the president agreed to issue an executive order that specified tax dollars could not be used for abortion except in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the woman.

Driehaus filed a complaint with the Ohio Elections Commission, and the commission found probable cause of a violation. But the ad never went up because the advertising company that owned the billboard space refused to allow it. Driehaus subsequently lost his reelection bid, and his complaint to the state elections commission was withdrawn. The Susan B. Anthony List was never prosecuted, but it nonetheless continued its legal challenge to the law. The lower court dismissed the suit, and the group appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, contending that its free speech rights had been violated. The group argues that under our Constitution, the government cannot decide what is false speech in the context of a political campaign.

Before the court actually gets to that question, however, those challenging the law must clear an important procedural hurdle. The court's conservative members have in the past been very strict about requiring a showing of actual harm to justify getting in the courtroom door. But the same justices who stress this test have also been the most aggressive in asserting the First Amendment right of free speech. They've used that principal in striking down laws that limit corporate and union campaign spending, for instance.

In the Ohio case being argued today, civil libertarians on the left and right have filed briefs opposing the law against lying. They point a lot of famously false statements by those in public life. President Nixon, who later resigned in disgrace.

PRESIDENT RICHARD NIXON: People have got to know whether or not their president is a crook. Well, I'm not a crook.

TOTENBERG: President Clinton, accused of having an extramarital affair in the White House.

PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON: I did not have sexual relations with that woman.

TOTENBERG: President George H.W. Bush, speaking at the convention that nominated him for the presidency in 1988, made this pledge on taxes.

PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH: Read my lips: no new taxes.

TOTENBERG: And President Obama, campaigning for his health care plan.

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: If you like your private health insurance plan, you can keep your plan, period.

TOTENBERG: Whether each of these statements was made knowing it was false is at least debatable, but just listing them makes the point that falsity in politics may sometimes be hard to define.

Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky is the Senate Majority Leader.

Throughout August, senators had the opportunity to travel around their states and listen to the concerns of their constituents. The American people have a lot on their minds these days — important issues they expect the Democrat-run Senate to address: things like high unemployment, threats of terrorism, rising health care costs and the ongoing crisis at the border.

Unfortunately, hardly any of those things will be on the Senate’s agenda when it returns Monday.

Story Continued Below

That’s because the Democrats who control the Senate say they’re more interested in repealing the free speech protections the First Amendment guarantees to all Americans. Their goal is to shut down the voices of their critics at a moment when they fear the loss of their fragile Senate majority. And to achieve it, they’re willing to devote roughly half of the remaining legislative days before November to this quixotic anti-speech gambit.

The proposal they want to consider would empower incumbent politicians to write the rules on who gets to speak and who doesn’t. And while no one likes to be criticized, the way for Senate Democrats to avoid it is to make better arguments, or even better, to come up with better ideas — not shut up their constituents.

Not surprisingly, a proposal as bad as the one Senate Democrats are pushing won’t even come close to garnering the votes it would need to pass. But to many Democrats, that’s just the point. They want this proposal to fail because they think that somehow would help them on Election Day — they think it will help drive to the polls more left-wing voters who don’t like having to defend their ideas.

If all this seems like an object lesson in why most Americans are so disgusted with Washington right now, that’s because it is. With legislative priorities like this, it’s no wonder a recent Quinnipiac poll found that just 14 percent of respondents say they think the government in Washington can be counted on to do what’s right most or all of the time.

A more sensible approach would be for the Democrats who run the Senate to take up the slew of job-creation bills the Republican-controlled House already has passed, some with overwhelming bipartisan support. But Senate Democrats prefer to spend their time on bizarre sideshows like trying to take an eraser to the First Amendment.

None of this should be surprising to even the most casual observer of the Senate these days. Earlier this year, the Democratic leadership rolled out a partisan playbook drafted by campaign staffers that spelled out just how they planned to run the Senate in the run-up to November. It was filled with partisan proposals designed specifically to fail so Democrats could campaign on the failure of that legislation, blaming Republicans for what wasn’t done.",www.politico.com,left,sGShrpvH1aldZVtU

The four plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority are from across the political spectrum : the American Civil Liberties Union , a health care group called Carafem that provides abortions , People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos .
What they have in common is that the transit agency known as WMATA has rejected their advertisements , saying the ads ran counter to its guidelines . They have now banded together , saying the guidelines introduced in 2015 violate their First Amendment right to free speech .
In fact , the ACLU 's rejected advertisement displays the text of the First Amendment in English , Arabic and Spanish , with the ACLU 's logo and the slogan `` We the People . ''
WMATA did not explain in writing why it rejected the ACLU 's ad , according to the complaint . Outfront Media , which manages the system 's advertising , initially told the ACLU that it was rejected because it `` does not take any issue oriented advertising . '' Outfront later stated that `` you 'll need to dramatically change your creative in order to resubmit , '' the complaint says .
`` In its zeal to avoid hosting offensive and hateful speech , the government has eliminated speech that makes us think , including the text of the First Amendment itself , '' said ACLU senior staff attorney Lee Rowland . `` The ACLU could not more strongly disagree with the values that Milo Yiannopoulos espouses , but we ca n't allow the government to pick and choose which viewpoints are acceptable . ''
The D.C. metro system changed its advertising policy in 2015 . According to the ACLU , it happened `` following controversy surrounding a set of anti-Muslim advertisement . '' The ACLU , Carafem and PETA had previously advertised with Metro .
The guidelines on commercial advertising , which are published on WMATA 's website , say medical messages are allowed `` only from government health organizations , or if the substance of the message is currently accepted by the American Medical Associated and/or the Food and Drug Administration . ''
It also blocks ads `` intended to influence members of the public regarding an issue on which there are varying opinions , '' those `` that support or oppose an industry position or industry goal without any commercial benefit to the advertiser '' and those `` that are intended to influence public policy . ''
In a statement about the lawsuit to NPR , WMATA pointed to its change in policy and said it `` intends to vigorously defend its commercial advertising guidelines , which are reasonable and viewpoint neutral . ''
The Carafem advertisement says it sells the FDA-approved mifeprex/misoprostol regimen used to end pregnancy at up to 10 weeks . The `` 10-week-after pill , '' it reads , `` for abortion up to 10 weeks . ''
WMATA rejected multiple PETA ads , including one saying `` I 'm ME , not MEAT . See the Individual . Go Vegan , '' next to a photo of a pig .

Critics have long decried efforts to stifle or disrupt conservative speakers at college campuses , such as the University of California at Berkeley , which cited safety concerns in canceling speeches by right-wing commentator Milo Yiannopoulos in 2017 . That same year , a student group also pulled its sponsorship for a speech by Ann Coulter , facing stiff criticism .
But the notedly liberal university , which was plagued with violence by mostly off-campus activists in 2017 , has since hosted several conservative speakers such as Ben Shapiro , Candace Owens and Rick Santorum , and has paid for their security details .
“ In the last year alone , this university spent more than $ 4 million to ensure that our conservative students could safely and successfully hold events on campus and invite speakers of their choice to these events , ” UC Berkeley spokesman Dan Mogulof said in an email .
What ’ s more , in the Feb. 19 assault on conservative organizer Hayden Williams , university officials denounced the violence and called for upholding free speech , while campus police worked with Berkeley law enforcement to identify and arrest the suspect — Zachary Greenberg , who , like Mr. Williams , is not a student at the university .
“ If [ colleges ] want our dollars , and we give it to them by the billions , they ’ ve got to allow people like Hayden and many other great young people and old people to speak , ” Mr. Trump said this month at the Conservative Political Action Conference near Washington .
However , Lynn C. Pasquerella , president of the Association of American Colleges and Universities , questions how the university itself can be blamed — and punished — for the incident .
“ Hayden Williams , an outside speaker , is invited to campus , is allowed to speak , and somebody — Zachary Greenberg — hits him and is arrested immediately . What could they do ? What could they have done to provide further protection ? ” Ms. Pasquerella told The ███ .
“ The absurd allegations regarding UC Berkeley ’ s support for free speech and all of its students , regardless of their perspectives , have no basis in fact , ” said Mr. Mogulof .
At CPAC , Mr. Trump vowed to issue an executive order that would cut off federal funding for research grants awarded to universities that don ’ t support free speech on their campuses .
“ We reject oppressive speech codes , censorship , political correctness and every other attempt by the hard left to stop people from challenging ridiculous and dangerous ideas , ” the president said . “ Instead , we believe in free speech , including online and including on campus . ”
The White House declined to provide specifics or a timeline for an executive order .
Several states , including Florida and Colorado , have banned restrictive “ free speech zones ” on college campuses , and several universities have adopted the “ Chicago statement , ” an affirmation of free expression ’ s importance to higher learning . An executive order would be an additional tool to scrutinize schools on free speech issues .
“ This is a false crisis narrative that has been created by President Trump and his administration , ” Ms. Pasquerella said . “ Everybody is concerned about First Amendment issues and freedom . You can ’ t have a liberal education without this free exchange . ”
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that academic centers perform $ 35 billion in research and development annually for the federal government . Small technical schools , state-run colleges and big-league research institutions such as Johns Hopkins University are among the sources of studies on topics such as nanotechnology and literacy teaching in elementary schools .
For many large state colleges , discussions about free speech on campus have long been couched in partisan terms . J.B. Bird , a spokesman for the University of Texas at Austin , described a visit this fall by conservative commentator Charlie Kirk , who offered students an opportunity to debate him .
“ It ’ s hard to experience from the outside , but there was a great free speech exchange between students and Kirk , ” Mr. Bird said .
Near the event ’ s end , a student who disagreed with Mr. Kirk threw a cup of water on an event staff member . Campus police “ immediately swooped in ” to take the student to the side and converse with him , Mr. Bird said . The student was charged with a class C misdemeanor , but some media outlets jumped on the incident .
“ The whole event showed you that there was really positive interaction and [ it was ] a great example of freedom of speech in action , ” Mr. Bird said . “ But different people characterize the event differently . ”","President Trump has promised to end federal research grants for universities that don’t “support free speech,” but determining which colleges support a marketplace of ideas can present a kind of political Rorschach test.

“This is a false crisis narrative that has been created by President Trump and his administration,” Ms. Pasquerella said. “Everybody is concerned about First Amendment issues and freedom. You can’t have a liberal education without this free exchange.”

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that academic centers perform $35 billion in research and development annually for the federal government. Small technical schools, state-run colleges and big-league research institutions such as Johns Hopkins University are among the sources of studies on topics such as nanotechnology and literacy teaching in elementary schools.

For many large state colleges, discussions about free speech on campus have long been couched in partisan terms. J.B. Bird, a spokesman for the University of Texas at Austin, described a visit this fall by conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, who offered students an opportunity to debate him.

“It’s hard to experience from the outside, but there was a great free speech exchange between students and Kirk,” Mr. Bird said.

Near the event’s end, a student who disagreed with Mr. Kirk threw a cup of water on an event staff member. Campus police “immediately swooped in” to take the student to the side and converse with him, Mr. Bird said. The student was charged with a class C misdemeanor, but some media outlets jumped on the incident.

“The whole event showed you that there was really positive interaction and [it was] a great example of freedom of speech in action,” Mr. Bird said. “But different people characterize the event differently.”

The U.S. Supreme Court struggled Monday with conflicting notions of where to draw the line between free speech and criminal threats in the Internet age . At issue was the conviction of a Pennsylvania man for making threats against his estranged wife and an FBI agent .
After Anthony Elonis ' wife left him , he began posting grisly messages on his Facebook page , promising not to rest until her body was `` soaked in blood and dying . '' She then got a court order barring him from threatening and harassing her , even indirectly . But he continued to post on Facebook , asking if the court order was `` thick enough to stop a bullet '' and musing about making a name for himself by shooting up a kindergarten . After a visit from a female FBI agent , he posted on Facebook , saying it `` took all the strength I had not to ... slit her throat , leave her bleedin ' from her jugular . ''
Elonis was convicted of making illegal threats and sentenced to 44 months in prison . But he contends that he is an aspiring rap artist , and that his comments were just his way of venting and expressing himself .
The case has become a test of what the prosecution must prove to win a conviction in Internet threat cases . The government , backed by victims ' rights groups , contends that the prosecution must show only that a reasonable person would interpret the Facebook posts as threats to commit bodily harm . But Elonis ' lawyer , John Elwood , told the court that the prosecution must make a far more rigorous showing .
`` How does one prove what 's in somebody else 's mind ? '' asked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , who was back on the bench just five days after having a heart stent implanted .
Elwood answered that you can examine a person 's computer and cellphone records .
`` Yeah , you are going to find a lot of information on the cellphone that the guy is really angry at his ex-wife and would like her to suffer , '' Chief Justice John Roberts observed , and when he puts some of that online , he 's going to claim that the post was `` therapeutic '' venting .
`` I 'm trying to figure out what 'level of intent ' you want , '' Justice Elena Kagan said to lawyer Elwood . The highest level , she noted , would require proof that the purpose was to put `` this person in fear . '' A step down would be that `` I know that I am going to place this person in fear , '' but I am `` fulfilling my artistic fantasies . '' And a third level would be recklessness , meaning that `` you know there is a substantial probability that you will place that person in fear , '' but you do n't know it `` to a certainty . ''
Elwood picked the second option , knowledge that you would put someone in fear .
`` What would be wrong with a recklessness standard ? '' Kagan asked . `` It gets you up one level from what the government wants . ''
Elwood argued that it would allow people , many of them teenagers , who are just `` shooting off their mouths , '' to be thrown in jail .
Justice Samuel Alito , however , countered that Elwood 's standard would provide `` a road map for threatening a spouse and getting away with it . '' You would only have to say `` just kidding '' at the end of a post , or call yourself `` an aspiring rap artist , '' he said .
When Elonis threatened to shoot up a kindergarten , Justice Alito added , would the jury have to `` get into the mind of this obsessed , somewhat disturbed individual '' and try to figure out whether he really knew that this would cause a panic on the part of the school officials and parents ?
`` Yes , exactly , '' Elwood said. `` It 's the same thing that juries do all the time . ''
Arguing the contrary position , Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben contended that people like Elonis should be held accountable for the `` ordinary and natural meaning of the words '' they use , in context .
Chief Justice Roberts , the father of teenagers , asked if the reasonable person standard would also mean a reasonable teenager .
What about an older audience ? Would the person posting on Facebook have to know how rap lyrics are interpreted by a `` general audience ? ''
Roberts then read aloud some explicit lyrics from rapper Eminem about what he would like to do to his ex-wife . Would those words justify prosecution , asked the chief justice .
No , Dreeben replied , because Eminem 's lyrics are said `` at a concert where people are going to be entertained . '' The critical context here is that Eminem did n't voice his lyrics privately , said Dreeben , nor had the rapper 's wife gotten a protection-from-abuse order .
Justice Stephen Breyer , noting that a lot of these threat cases arise in domestic relations matters , observed that `` people do say things in domestic disputes that they are awfully sorry about later . ''
Justice Antonin Scalia took issue with that proposition . `` I do n't agree ... that in marital disputes people make physical threats ... I think that 's rather unusual . ''
Scalia was the only justice to suggest that the speech at issue in the Elonis case `` is not worth a whole lot anyway , '' regardless of its intent or context .
Justice Kagan , in contrast , seemed to suggest that the government 's position is too broad . We typically require a kind of buffer zone in First Amendment cases , she said , to make sure that `` even stuff that is wrongful maybe is permitted because we do n't want to chill '' the right to speak freely .
But Dreeben replied that the rule of law applied by the lower courts in the Elonis case is also used in most of the country and there is `` no evidence '' anyone 's speech has been chilled .
`` The proof is in the pudding , '' he contended . But the justices did n't seem so sure the pudding he presented was to their liking .

As of last week , however , you can not get any of Dr. Joseph Nicolosi Sr. ’ s books about leaving homosexuality—because Amazon just banned them all .
From 1981 until his death in 2017 , my father was the driving force behind reparative therapy . He invented , refined , and used this innovative counseling method to help thousands of men overcome the effects of sexual abuse and other deep-seated childhood traumas .
These men told my father that his scientifically sound practices helped re-orient their sexuality away from obsessions with pornography , and helped them reduce their unwanted same-sex attractions .
The books Amazon banned are the continuation of my father ’ s legacy and of the changes that can take place through his methods . The books have hundreds of endorsements , from typical readers to past presidents of the American Psychological Association .
In one comment , which Amazon has now “ banned , ” a man said the book “ Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality ” saved his marriage .

As of last week, however, you cannot get any of Dr. Joseph Nicolosi Sr.’s books about leaving homosexuality—because Amazon just banned them all.



From 1981 until his death in 2017, my father was the driving force behind reparative therapy. He invented, refined, and used this innovative counseling method to help thousands of men overcome the effects of sexual abuse and other deep-seated childhood traumas.



These men told my father that his scientifically sound practices helped re-orient their sexuality away from obsessions with pornography, and helped them reduce their unwanted same-sex attractions.



The books Amazon banned are the continuation of my father’s legacy and of the changes that can take place through his methods. The books have hundreds of endorsements, from typical readers to past presidents of the American Psychological Association.

In one comment, which Amazon has now “banned,” a man said the book “Reparative Therapy of Male Homosexuality” saved his marriage.



Luckily for that man, he was able to find marital help before Amazon became the PC police. Today, he and many other families will now find fewer online resources than ever—not because science dictates their removal, but because LGBT ideology has shouted down sound science.



While Amazon is banning books—and restricting choice among those with unwanted same-sex attractions—some state governments are banning my father’s therapeutic practices.

But it’s clear that no government official who is voting to restrict client choice actually knows what reparative therapy entails. And with Amazon banning his books, radical LGBT activists hope to prevent even more lawmakers from ever finding out the truth.



Contrary to what these activists and their allies at Amazon claim, my father never advocated so-called conversion therapy.

Conversion therapy is broad, ill-defined, has no ethics code, no governing body, and is typically practiced by unlicensed individuals. My father had nothing to do with these or any similar practices, and as a therapist myself, I wholeheartedly condemn such a concept.



What my father did do was use his psychological training and his Judeo-Christian worldview to help men overcome traumas that they—and he—believed were leading them into a life that did not reflect the men they were truly designed by their creator to be.

He counseled families who were struggling with accepting their children, and he always told them, “Love your child, whatever the outcome of therapy may be.”



This week’s book ban by Amazon and radical LGBT activists reveals the blatant hypocrisy of today’s leaders of the LGBT movement: They celebrate exploration of every kind of sexuality they can imagine, unless that exploration happens to lead an individual toward a traditional, heterosexual lifestyle. That sort of exploration, of course, must be banned.



My hope is that there will be a large enough outcry from consumers that Amazon will rethink its decision. If it doesn’t, my dad’s books won’t be the last to get blacklisted.

Writers like Jordan Peterson and Ben Shapiro appeal to the growing number of Americans who feel left behind by mainstream American culture.

It’s been interesting to watch and read the many critics of Bari Weiss’s instantly controversial piece on the leaders of the so-called Intellectual Dark Web. Rarely have more people more contemptuously missed the point. Rarely have more people inadvertently confirmed the need for a movement of intellectual free-thinkers.

Much of the criticism has centered on whether the few very successful, sometimes wealthy pundits who comprise this “movement” can in any real way be considered “renegades” or “outcasts.” They write best-selling books. Their podcasts are downloaded tens of millions of times. They appear all over mainstream media. Isn’t it just silly to believe that modern American political correctness in any way silences or inhibits their voices?

Of course, as Weiss notes, the path to prominence for many of these now-popular people has sometimes been painful. Bret Weinstein faced down the mob at Evergreen State College. Before Jordan Peterson became an international sensation, he battled (at great professional risk) for free speech in Canada. My friend Ben Shapiro resigned from Breitbart and endured an unholy avalanche of anti-Semitic hate because he made a principled stand against Donald Trump. But all of these folks pushed through.

The acolytes of these free-thinkers aren’t powerful. They haven’t pushed through political correctness. Instead, they live in fear of speaking their minds. They are growing weary of propaganda, yet many of the standard avenues for education and self-improvement now speak with one voice and permit little dissent. They fear that even asking questions could endanger their livelihoods and ruin their public reputations.

Simply put, Title IX cannot require administrators to violate the First Amendment.

Williamson, Victor Davis Hanson, Yuval Levin","Anyone not loyal to a certain ideology must be resisted , rejected , and renounced .
Demosthenes , the Athenian rhetorician and champion of liberty , pointed out around 355 B.C . that residents of Athens were free to praise Sparta ’ s regime , but Spartans were banned from praising Athens .
In 1689 , the British passed a law guaranteeing freedom of speech in Parliament . A century later , French revolutionaries incorporated into law the Declaration of the Rights of Man , which established free speech as a universal right . Two years later , the Americans ratified the First Amendment , which guarantees that the state shall not infringe on the right to free speech . Roughly a century and half later , in 1948 , the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which says , “ Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression . . . . ”
I mention all of this because every time I read or hear about the pathetic state of affairs at the University of California , Berkeley — where conservative speakers and rabble-rousers alike are banned from speaking lest they be assaulted by a mob — journalists and other commentators insist on pointing out the irony that this is all happening “ where the Free Speech Movement was born . ”
Yes , I know there was a thing called the Free Speech Movement . And , yes , its members and leaders talked a good deal about free speech .
But the movement for free speech is thousands of years old and runs like a deep river across the landscape of Western Civilization .
Indeed , I can ’ t help but get the impression that a lot of people don ’ t realize that the Free Speech Movement in this context is a brand name . I can tell you that the “ mockumentary ” band Spinal Tap was born in a 1979 TV skit for ABC . But that is not the same thing as saying the medical procedure – a.k.a . the lumbar puncture — was born in the same skit .
Mario Savio , the leader of the Free Speech Movement at Berkeley , was committed to free speech . But so was Berkeley at the time . In the years before Savio ’ s movement , Berkeley had hosted speeches by communists , Nazis ( invited by leftists to cause a stir ) , and political and literary speakers of every stripe .
Whatever perfunctory regulations of free speech existed , then-Berkeley professor Nathan Glazer explained in his 1965 Commentary essay “ What Happened at Berkeley , ” went “ back to a time when no political activity of any kind was allowed on campus. ” Even presidential candidates were barred from politicking because , “ as a state university it was not supposed to be involved in politics. ” But by 1964 , these rules had already been loosened a great deal .
The rioters and goons — along with their pusillanimous enablers in the administration — are carrying on this tradition .
As for Savio , his mission was broader than merely wanting to allow vigorous debate . He wanted students to be able to participate as much as possible with the civil-rights movement , which , obviously , was a very political movement . He was on the right side of that argument .
But Savio was also a passionate leftist . ( When he got married to his fellow FSMer Suzanne Goldberg , the Daily Worker ’ s Mike Gold asked him what they wanted for a wedding present . “ All that we really want is for President Johnson to withdraw all our troops from Vietnam and the Dominican Republic .

Anyone not loyal to a certain ideology must be resisted, rejected, and renounced.

Demosthenes, the Athenian rhetorician and champion of liberty, pointed out around 355 B.C. that residents of Athens were free to praise Sparta’s regime, but Spartans were banned from praising Athens.

In 1689, the British passed a law guaranteeing freedom of speech in Parliament. A century later, French revolutionaries incorporated into law the Declaration of the Rights of Man, which established free speech as a universal right. Two years later, the Americans ratified the First Amendment, which guarantees that the state shall not infringe on the right to free speech. Roughly a century and half later, in 1948, the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which says, “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression. . . . ”

I mention all of this because every time I read or hear about the pathetic state of affairs at the University of California, Berkeley — where conservative speakers and rabble-rousers alike are banned from speaking lest they be assaulted by a mob — journalists and other commentators insist on pointing out the irony that this is all happening “where the Free Speech Movement was born.”

Yes, I know there was a thing called the Free Speech Movement. And, yes, its members and leaders talked a good deal about free speech.

But the movement for free speech is thousands of years old and runs like a deep river across the landscape of Western Civilization.

Indeed, I can’t help but get the impression that a lot of people don’t realize that the Free Speech Movement in this context is a brand name. I can tell you that the “mockumentary” band Spinal Tap was born in a 1979 TV skit for ABC. But that is not the same thing as saying the medical procedure – a.k.a. the lumbar puncture — was born in the same skit.

Mario Savio, the leader of the Free Speech Movement at Berkeley, was committed to free speech. But so was Berkeley at the time. In the years before Savio’s movement, Berkeley had hosted speeches by communists, Nazis (invited by leftists to cause a stir), and political and literary speakers of every stripe.

Whatever perfunctory regulations of free speech existed, then-Berkeley professor Nathan Glazer explained in his 1965 Commentary essay “What Happened at Berkeley,” went “back to a time when no political activity of any kind was allowed on campus.” Even presidential candidates were barred from politicking because, “as a state university it was not supposed to be involved in politics.” But by 1964, these rules had already been loosened a great deal.

The rioters and goons — along with their pusillanimous enablers in the administration — are carrying on this tradition.

As for Savio, his mission was broader than merely wanting to allow vigorous debate. He wanted students to be able to participate as much as possible with the civil-rights movement, which, obviously, was a very political movement. He was on the right side of that argument.

But Savio was also a passionate leftist. (When he got married to his fellow FSMer Suzanne Goldberg, the Daily Worker’s Mike Gold asked him what they wanted for a wedding present. “All that we really want is for President Johnson to withdraw all our troops from Vietnam and the Dominican Republic. Very little would make us happier.”)

Savio had a romantic hatred — in the tradition of Rousseau — for liberal democratic capitalism. His most famous statement came in his speech at Sproul Hall in 1964:

There’s a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart, that you can’t take part! You can’t even passively take part! And you’ve got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels . . . upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you’ve got to make it stop! And you’ve got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it, that unless you’re free, the machine will be prevented from working at all!

Whatever legacy Savio has for the cause of free speech is dead, but this mindset lives on. The rioters and goons — along with their pusillanimous enablers in the administration — are carrying on this tradition. It is a tradition that says this is our sacred place and anyone not loyal to our faith must be resisted, rejected, and renounced. All the talk of “hate speech” is clever marketing — like the label the “Free Speech Movement” itself.

What these petty, secular theocrats despise is heresy speech. And they will throw their bodies into the gears to silence it.

SAN FRANCISCO ( AP ) — Twitter , reacting to growing concern about misinformation spread on social media , is banning all political advertising from its service . Its move strikes a sharp contrast with Facebook , which continues to defend running paid political ads , even false ones , as a free speech priority .
“ While internet advertising is incredibly powerful and very effective for commercial advertisers , that power brings significant risks to politics , where it can be used to influence votes to affect the lives of millions , ” Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said Wednesday in a series of tweets announcing the new policy .
Facebook has taken fire since it reiterated in September that it will not fact-check ads by politicians or their campaigns , which could allow them to lie freely . CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Congress in October that politicians have the right to free speech on Facebook .
Zuckerberg wasted no time responding to Twitter ’ s move . During Facebook ’ s conference call for earnings , which began less than an hour after Dorsey ’ s tweet , the Facebook chief offered an impassioned monologue about what he called his company ’ s deep belief “ that political speech is important . ”
Zuckerberg stood by the company ’ s decision to run unchecked political ads and denied that the choice is financially motivated , saying such ads make up less than half of a percent of Facebook revenue .
Facebook ’ s recent $ 5 billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission for privacy violations was more than 10 times what it makes from political ads , he said .
“ This is complex stuff . Anyone who says the answer is simple hasn ’ t thought about the nuances and downstream challenges , ” he said . “ I don ’ t think anyone can say that we are not doing what we believe or we haven ’ t thought hard about these issues . ”

“ This is yet another attempt to silence conservatives , since Twitter knows President Trump has the most sophisticated online program ever , ” campaign manager Brad Parscale said .
The presidential campaign for former Vice President Joe Biden said it was “ unfortunate ” that companies would think the only option was to completely ban political ads .
“ When faced with a choice between ad dollars and the integrity of our democracy , it is encouraging that , for once , revenue did not win out , ” Bill Russo , the deputy communications director for Biden ’ s campaign said in a statement .
Political advertising makes up a small sliver of Twitter ’ s overall revenue . The company does not break out specific figures each quarter , but said political ad spending for the 2018 midterm election was less than $ 3 million . It reported $ 824 million in third-quarter revenue .

The issue suddenly arose in September when Twitter , along with Facebook and Google , refused to remove a misleading video ad from President Donald Trump ’ s campaign that targeted Biden .

The whole idea of a free society is based on a very simple idea that is very hard to live by: People have the right to be wrong.

This idea has ancient roots, but it was always and everywhere a minority opinion, unpopular with both the masses and the rulers, until relatively recently.

In the “modern” era, its status as one of the defining ideas of Western civilization can be traced to the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. After a century of bloody religious wars between Catholics and Protestants — with Jews often getting caught in the crossfire — the exhausted rulers of Europe reluctantly agreed to a fragile truce. While every nation would still officially follow the faith of the ruler, it was understood that religious minorities would be afforded some tolerance. Persecuting religious dissenters in one nation might reignite war, as rulers of other countries would feel obliged to defend their coreligionists abroad. (To see how that dynamic works today, just look at how Sunni and Shia governments in the Middle East send aid or troops to defend their brethren in neighboring lands.)

He beseeched Parliament to allow some measure of liberty “to all who fear God.”

Now, Europe in the 1600s wasn’t some libertarian nirvana. True freedom of conscience did not exist in England, France, or anywhere else in the world. For instance, Cromwell’s Puritan-dominated parliament declared a real “war on Christmas,” banning celebration of the holiday. The Colonial city of Boston followed a similar practice, imposing a fine on anyone who celebrated Christmas.

Why revisit this history? For two reasons. First, to underscore how culture wars are nothing new in the West, and as bad as ours are today, they could get much, much worse. Second, to illustrate a point lost on culture warriors of the left and the right. Pluralism and tolerance are not simply nice ideals, like good manners. They are what management gurus call “best practices,” learned after millennia of gory trial and error.

Very few people who embraced doctrines of religious and political liberty did so at first because they thought it was the right way to organize society. Cromwell was more a religious zealot than any Christian right-winger today. If he thought he could get away with it, he would have made mandatory compliance with his faith the law of the land.

Thomas Jefferson had strong views on religion, but his Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom disestablished the Church of England and established religious liberty for Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, even pagans. The statute became the foundation for the First Amendment.

You might think that the current controversy over NFL players refusing to stand for the National Anthem, the vandalizing or removal of statues — not just of Confederate generals, but of any real or alleged historical villains — and the P.C. firestorms erupting across American campuses aren’t about religion, so this history doesn’t have much relevance for today.

But you would be wrong.

The religious conflicts of the past were ultimately about which values, rituals, customs, and ideas should be imposed on everybody.

`` Under the guise of speech codes and safe spaces and trigger warnings , these universities have tried to restrict free thought , impose total conformity and shutdown the voices of great young Americans , '' Trump said Thursday before signing the order .
The order , however , essentially reinforces what schools are already supposed to be doing by formally requiring colleges to agree to promote free inquiry in order to get billions of dollars in federal research funding .
`` While many schools — or all schools — are frankly supposed to follow this currently , it will ensure that grant dollars are associated through the grant-making process , and schools will have to certify that they ’ re following this condition , '' a senior administration official said earlier Thursday .
Still the move , and the president 's rhetoric surrounding it , raised alarms for some civil liberties groups and conservatives — including at least one Republican lawmaker — who expressed concerns about federal overreach .
`` I don ’ t want to see Congress or the president or the department of anything creating speech codes to define what you can say on campus , '' Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R-Tenn. ) , who chairs the Senate HELP Committee , said in a statement . `` The U.S. Constitution guarantees free speech . Federal courts define and enforce it . The Department of Justice can weigh in . Conservatives don ’ t like it when judges try to write laws , and conservatives should not like it when legislators and agencies try to rewrite the Constitution . ”
The order directs 12 federal agencies that fund university research to add language to existing agreements that colleges have to sign to get the money . Public universities will have to vow to uphold the First Amendment — something they already must do — and private universities will have to promise to uphold their own `` stated institutional policies regarding freedom of speech , '' essentially setting their own rules .
It will be up to the agencies to enforce the agreements , as they already do .
`` Today we ’ re delivering a clear message to the professors and power structures trying to suppress dissent and keep young Americans — and all Americans , not just young Americans … from challenging rigid , far-left ideology , '' Trump said . `` If the university does n't allow you to speak , we will not give them money — it 's very simple . ''
The president vowed it was `` the first in a series of steps we will take to defend students ' rights . ''
The executive order is `` plainly unnecessary , '' the president of a group of public universities said .
`` Public universities are already bound by the First Amendment and work each day to defend and honor it , '' Peter McPherson , president of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities , said . “ As institutions of higher learning , public universities are constantly working to identify new ways to educate students on the importance of free expression , provide venues for free speech , and advance our world through free academic inquiry .
“ This executive order doesn ’ t do much with regard to free speech , '' ACLU Senior Legislative Counsel Kate Ruane said in a statement . `` Instead , it tells public universities to abide by the First Amendment , as they are already required to do , and private universities to abide by their existing policies .

Some conservatives , however , believe colleges have n't done that , and are regularly stifling speech — especially conservative speech — by banning speakers , creating speech zones and pushing trigger warnings .
`` College campuses are ground zero in the campaign by the liberal left to shut down conservative dissent , '' said Chandler Thornton , chairman of the College Republican National Committee . `` President Trump 's executive order is critically needed because college and university bureaucrats have absolutely failed to protect free speech on campus .

Trump previously threatened to withdraw federal funding to the University of California , Berkeley , after riots on campus led it to cancel an event at which far-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos was scheduled to speak . At Trump 's CPAC speech where he first mentioned the executive order , the president brought to the stage Hayden Williams , a conservative activist who was punched in the face while recruiting on the Berkeley campus for the conservative youth group Turning Point USA .

Some , however , remained skeptical of federal intrusions into campus speech , especially given the president ’ s framing of the issue . The conservative Charles Koch Institute pointed to a statement the White House issued in which Trump slammed “ oppressive speech codes , censorship , political correctness , and every other attempt by the hard left to stop people from challenging ridiculous and dangerous ideas .

The lawsuit is a response to the White House 's suspension of Acosta 's press pass , known as a Secret Service `` hard pass , '' last week . The suit alleges that Acosta and CNN 's First and Fifth Amendment rights are being violated by the ban .
The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Washington , D.C. on Tuesday morning . It was docketed and assigned to Judge Timothy J. Kelly , a Trump appointee . The judge has given the defendants an 11 a.m. Wednesday deadline to file responses to the suit . He has scheduled a hearing for Wednesday at 3:30 p.m .
Both CNN and Acosta are plaintiffs in the lawsuit . There are six defendants : Trump , chief of staff John Kelly , press secretary Sarah Sanders , deputy chief of staff for communications Bill Shine , Secret Service director Randolph Alles , and the Secret Service officer who took Acosta 's hard pass away last Wednesday .
The six defendants are all named because of their roles in enforcing and announcing Acosta 's suspension .
`` This is not a step we have taken lightly . But the White House action is unprecedented , '' CNN Worldwide president Jeff Zucker said in an internal memo to staff .
Sanders responded to the suit by saying that CNN is `` grandstanding '' by suing . She said the administration will `` vigorously defend '' itself . ( Read the White House 's full response here .
In a statement on Tuesday morning , CNN said it is seeking a preliminary injunction so that Acosta can return to the White House right away , and a ruling from the court preventing the White House from revoking Acosta 's pass in the future .
`` CNN filed a lawsuit against the Trump Administration this morning in DC District Court , '' the statement read . `` It demands the return of the White House credentials of CNN 's Chief White House correspondent , Jim Acosta . The wrongful revocation of these credentials violates CNN and Acosta 's First Amendment rights of freedom of the press , and their Fifth Amendment rights to due process . We have asked this court for an immediate restraining order requiring the pass be returned to Jim , and will seek permanent relief as part of this process . ''
The White House Correspondents ' Association said it `` strongly supports CNN 's goal of seeing their correspondent regain a US Secret Service security credential that the White House should not have taken away in the first place . ''
CNN also asserted that other news organizations could have been targeted by the Trump administration this way , and could be in the future .
`` While the suit is specific to CNN and Acosta , this could have happened to anyone , '' the network said . `` If left unchallenged , the actions of the White House would create a dangerous chilling effect for any journalist who covers our elected officials . ''
Sanders pointed out that lots of other CNN reporters and producers have press passes . But to many journalists and press defenders , that 's not the issue . Echoing the views of many journalists , the correspondents ' association said the president `` should not be in the business of arbitrarily picking the men and women who cover him . ''
Trump 's actions and threats fly in the face of decades of tradition and precedent . Republican and Democratic administrations alike have had a permissive approach toward press passes , erring on the side of greater access , even for obscure , partisan or fringe outlets .
The ACLU , in a statement supporting CNN , said `` it is un-American and unlawful for the president to expel a reporter from the WH briefing room for doing his job . It should n't take a lawsuit from CNN to remind the president of the First Amendment . ''
On CNN 's side , CNN Worldwide chief counsel David Vigilante is joined by two prominent attorneys , Ted Boutrous and Theodore Olson . Both men are partners at Gibson , Dunn & Crutcher .
Last week , before he was retained by CNN , Boutrous tweeted that the action against Acosta was `` angry , irrational , false , arbitrary , capricious content-based discrimination , '' and thus a clear violation of the First Amendment .
In an interview on Tuesday morning , Boutrous said CNN tried to resolve the matter privately , but the White House was not responsive so `` we really had no choice but to sue . ''
`` We did n't want to have to go to court . We wanted to just report the news , '' he said . `` Mr. Acosta wants to report the news . CNN wants to report the news . ''
CNN 's lawsuit cites , among other precedents , a 1977 ruling in favor of Robert Sherrill , a muckraking journalist who was denied access to the White House in 1966 .
Eleven years later , a D.C. Court of Appeals judge ruled that the Secret Service had to establish `` narrow and specific '' standards for judging applicants . In practice , the key question is whether the applicant would pose a threat to the president .
The code of federal regulations states that `` in granting or denying a request for a security clearance made in response to an application for a White House press pass , officials of the Secret Service will be guided solely by the principle of whether the applicant presents a potential source of physical danger to the President and/or the family of the President so serious as to justify his or her exclusion from White House press privileges . ''
There are other guidelines as well . Floyd Abrams , one of the country 's most respected First Amendment lawyers , said case law specifies that before a press pass is denied , `` you have to have notice , you have to have a chance to respond , and you have to have a written opinion by the White House as to what it 's doing and why , so the courts can examine it . ''
Acosta found out about his suspension when he walked up to the northwest gate of the White House , as usual , for a live shot last Wednesday night . He was abruptly told to turn in his `` hard pass , '' which speeds up entry and exit from the grounds .
`` I was just told to do it , '' the Secret Service officer said .
Around the same time Acosta was denied entry to the White House grounds , Sanders announced the decision and claimed that he had behaved inappropriately at a presidential news conference earlier in the day .
At first Sanders accused Acosta of `` placing his hands '' on an intern who was trying to take a microphone away from him . In reality , Acosta held onto the mic , said `` pardon me , ma'am , '' asked a followup question , then gave up the mic .
On Twitter , Sanders shared a distorted video clip of the press conference that did n't show the complete back-and-forth . The same video had been posted by an InfoWars personality two hours earlier .
The White House 's rationale was widely mocked and dismissed by journalists across the political spectrum . And Trump himself has cast doubt on the rationale : He said on Friday that Acosta was `` not nice to that young woman , '' but then he said , `` I do n't hold him for that because it was n't overly , you know , horrible . ''
In Tuesday 's response to the lawsuit , Sanders did not repeat her claim about Acosta `` placing his hands '' in the intern . Instead , she accused Acosta of being disrespectful and unprofessional .
As for the argument that Acosta is n't respectful enough , that justification `` is not sufficient as a matter of law , '' CNN 's lawsuit asserts .
`` The content and viewpoint of CNN 's and Acosta 's reporting on the Trump administration—not his interaction with the staffer at the November 7 press conference—were the real reason the White House indefinitely revoked his press credentials , '' the suit states .
Acosta is on a previously scheduled vacation this week . He declined to comment on the lawsuit . Since his pass was suspended , he has continued to do part of his job , contacting sources and filing stories , but he has been unable to attend White House events or ask questions in person -- a basic part of any White House correspondent 's role .
`` Relevant precedent says that a journalist has a First Amendment right of access to places closed to the public but open generally to the press . That includes press rooms and news conferences , '' Jonathan Peters , a media law professor at the University of Georgia , told CNN last week . `` In those places , if access is generally inclusive of the press , then access ca n't be denied arbitrarily or absent compelling reasons . And the reasons that the White House gave were wholly unconvincing and uncompelling . ''
Last Thursday , according to the suit , Zucker wrote to Kelly and requested reinstatement of Acosta 's credentials . Zucker 's message said that `` no complaints were raised with CNN and there was no attempt to reach anyone at CNN before taking this unlawful action . ''
The next day , CNN sent a formal letter to the White House repeating the request and warning of a possible lawsuit .
Over the weekend , Acosta reported on the president 's trip to France . Ahead of Trump 's planned visit to an American military cemetery , he requested and received a credential from the French government , but was denied access by the Secret Service .
`` It was not without irony to me that a U.S. White House correspondent who is an American citizen was denied access to a ceremony by his own government but was granted access by the government of France , '' CNN Washington bureau chief Sam Feist noted in a declaration attached to the lawsuit .

Correction : The original version of this article listed the former director of the Secret Service as a defendant ; the actual defendant is the current director .","New York (CNN) CNN has filed a lawsuit against President Trump and several of his aides, seeking the immediate restoration of chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta's access to the White House.

The lawsuit is a response to the White House's suspension of Acosta's press pass, known as a Secret Service ""hard pass,"" last week . The suit alleges that Acosta and CNN's First and Fifth Amendment rights are being violated by the ban.

The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday morning. It was docketed and assigned to Judge Timothy J. Kelly, a Trump appointee. The judge has given the defendants an 11 a.m. Wednesday deadline to file responses to the suit. He has scheduled a hearing for Wednesday at 3:30 p.m.

Both CNN and Acosta are plaintiffs in the lawsuit. There are six defendants: Trump, chief of staff John Kelly, press secretary Sarah Sanders, deputy chief of staff for communications Bill Shine, Secret Service director Randolph Alles, and the Secret Service officer who took Acosta's hard pass away last Wednesday.

The six defendants are all named because of their roles in enforcing and announcing Acosta's suspension.

""This is not a step we have taken lightly. But the White House action is unprecedented,"" CNN Worldwide president Jeff Zucker said in an internal memo to staff.

Sanders responded to the suit by saying that CNN is ""grandstanding"" by suing. She said the administration will ""vigorously defend"" itself. ( Read the White House's full response here.

In a statement on Tuesday morning, CNN said it is seeking a preliminary injunction so that Acosta can return to the White House right away, and a ruling from the court preventing the White House from revoking Acosta's pass in the future.

The White House Correspondents' Association said it ""strongly supports CNN's goal of seeing their correspondent regain a US Secret Service security credential that the White House should not have taken away in the first place.""

Trump's actions and threats fly in the face of decades of tradition and precedent. Republican and Democratic administrations alike have had a permissive approach toward press passes, erring on the side of greater access, even for obscure, partisan or fringe outlets.

The ACLU, in a statement supporting CNN, said ""it is un-American and unlawful for the president to expel a reporter from the WH briefing room for doing his job. It shouldn't take a lawsuit from CNN to remind the president of the First Amendment.""

The legal battle

On CNN's side, CNN Worldwide chief counsel David Vigilante is joined by two prominent attorneys, Ted Boutrous and Theodore Olson. Both men are partners at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher.

Last week, before he was retained by CNN, Boutrous tweeted that the action against Acosta was ""angry, irrational, false, arbitrary, capricious content-based discrimination,"" and thus a clear violation of the First Amendment.

In an interview on Tuesday morning, Boutrous said CNN tried to resolve the matter privately, but the White House was not responsive so ""we really had no choice but to sue.""

""We've had none of those things here,"" Abrams said.

CNN's suit makes the same point.

White House's shifting rationales

Acosta found out about his suspension when he walked up to the northwest gate of the White House, as usual, for a live shot last Wednesday night. He was abruptly told to turn in his ""hard pass,"" which speeds up entry and exit from the grounds.

""I was just told to do it,"" the Secret Service officer said.

Around the same time Acosta was denied entry to the White House grounds, Sanders announced the decision and claimed that he had behaved inappropriately at a presidential news conference earlier in the day.

At first Sanders accused Acosta of ""placing his hands"" on an intern who was trying to take a microphone away from him. In reality, Acosta held onto the mic, said ""pardon me, ma'am,"" asked a followup question, then gave up the mic.

On Twitter, Sanders shared a distorted video clip of the press conference that didn't show the complete back-and-forth. The same video had been posted by an InfoWars personality two hours earlier.

The White House's rationale was widely mocked and dismissed by journalists across the political spectrum. And Trump himself has cast doubt on the rationale: He said on Friday that Acosta was ""not nice to that young woman,"" but then he said, ""I don't hold him for that because it wasn't overly, you know, horrible.""

In Tuesday's response to the lawsuit, Sanders did not repeat her claim about Acosta ""placing his hands"" in the intern. Instead, she accused Acosta of being disrespectful and unprofessional.

Feist said ""Jim's ability to cover a public event of historic international importance was completely blocked by the White House.""

A high-stakes case

David McCraw, the top newsroom lawyer at The New York Times, said instances of news organizations suing a president are extremely rare.

Past examples are The New York Times v. U.S., the famous Supreme Court case involving the Pentagon Papers in 1971, and CNN's 1981 case against the White House and the broadcast networks, when CNN sued to be included in the White House press pool.

The backdrop to this new suit, of course, is Trump's antipathy for CNN and other news outlets. He regularly derides reporters from CNN and the network as a whole. But he also seeks out attention from CNN and other outlets.

During his presidential campaign, Trump told CNN that, if elected, he would not kick reporters out of the White House. But since moving into the White House, he has mused privately about taking away credentials, CNN reported earlier this year. He brought it up publicly on Twitter in May, tweeting ""take away credentials?"" as a question.

And he said it again on Friday, two days after blacklisting Acosta. ""It could be others also,"" he said, suggesting he may strip press passes from other reporters. Unprompted, he then named and insulted April Ryan, a CNN analyst and veteran radio correspondent.

""The revocation of Acosta's credentials is only the beginning,"" CNN's suit alleges.

""Update on our continued review–we have suspended this channel’s monetization,"" YouTube said in the tweet on Wednesday announcing Crowder will not be able to make money from ad revenue on his videos. ""We came to this decision because a pattern of egregious actions has harmed the broader community and is against our YouTube Partner Program policies.""

The announcement came one day after the company stated he wasn't in violation of any of its rules.

Social media analytics website Social Blade estimates Crowder could have been generating as much $1.29 million annually from his YouTube channel.

Students at the University of Florida , where a white nationalist leader will speak on Thursday , are facing a difficult choice .
They could listen to Richard Spencer , who wants to form a “ white ethno-state ” in North America , address the aftermath of the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville that left dozens of counter-protesters seriously injured and one young woman dead . They could protest as part of the “ No Nazis at University of Florida ” rally , which more than 2,000 people on Facebook say they plan to attend . Or they could go to Disney World .
Valery Raymond , 22 , said he believed going to Disney World with his college friends would be the best choice .

“ Protesting in this situation wouldn ’ t elicit anything positive , ” said Raymond , who is black . “ I just feel the best thing to do was just to get away , get far enough where I wouldn ’ t even think about it . ”
Spencer , he said , is “ basically like a class clown , and they just want attention . If you don ’ t give them attention , then they lose power . ”
Thursday ’ s afternoon speech in Gainesville , Florida , will be Spencer ’ s first major public event since a joint rally of far-right groups Charlottesville sparked open fighting in the streets and a fatal attack on a crowd of counter-protesters .
Florida ’ s governor , Rick Scott , has already declared a state of emergency in the county where the school is located , giving local law enforcement more resources and latitude to respond to unfolding events . On Twitter , Spencer has shared multiple posts comparing himself to a hurricane about to hit Florida .
Since Charlottesville , American public universities have split over whether to allow him to speak or deny him a platform and face a lawsuit over free speech rights .
In April , Auburn University in Alabama attempted to shut down Spencer ’ s visit to its campus over concerns that it would endanger public safety . But a federal judge handed him a victory , ordering Auburn to let Spencer speak , citing first amendment protections .
Play Video 2:27 President condemns violence 'on many sides ' – video
“ While Mr Spencer ’ s beliefs and message are controversial , Auburn presented no evidence that Mr Spencer advocates violence , ” US district judge Keith Watkins ruled . He also wrote that to cancel Spencer ’ s speech “ based on its belief that listeners and protest groups opposed to Mr Spencer ’ s ideology would react to the content of his speech by engaging in protests that could cause violence or property damage ” was not a legal justification .
For Spencer , the University of Florida speech may be a chance to try to reset the conversation from the intense public condemnation that followed Charlottesville . A speech at Texas A & M University last year offered him the opportunity to garner new media attention after the outrage over Spencer ’ s choice to shout “ Hail Trump ! Hail Victory ! ” at a conference last November , which was met with Nazi salutes .

Students at the University of Florida, where a white nationalist leader will speak on Thursday, are facing a difficult choice.

They could listen to Richard Spencer, who wants to form a “white ethno-state” in North America, address the aftermath of the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville that left dozens of counter-protesters seriously injured and one young woman dead. They could protest as part of the “No Nazis at University of Florida” rally, which more than 2,000 people on Facebook say they plan to attend. Or they could go to Disney World.

Valery Raymond, 22, said he believed going to Disney World with his college friends would be the best choice.

“Protesting in this situation wouldn’t elicit anything positive,” said Raymond, who is black. “I just feel the best thing to do was just to get away, get far enough where I wouldn’t even think about it.”

Spencer, he said, is “basically like a class clown, and they just want attention. If you don’t give them attention, then they lose power.”

Thursday’s afternoon speech in Gainesville, Florida, will be Spencer’s first major public event since a joint rally of far-right groups Charlottesville sparked open fighting in the streets and a fatal attack on a crowd of counter-protesters.

Florida’s governor, Rick Scott, has already declared a state of emergency in the county where the school is located, giving local law enforcement more resources and latitude to respond to unfolding events. On Twitter, Spencer has shared multiple posts comparing himself to a hurricane about to hit Florida.

Since Charlottesville, American public universities have split over whether to allow him to speak or deny him a platform and face a lawsuit over free speech rights.

In April, Auburn University in Alabama attempted to shut down Spencer’s visit to its campus over concerns that it would endanger public safety. But a federal judge handed him a victory, ordering Auburn to let Spencer speak, citing first amendment protections.

“While Mr Spencer’s beliefs and message are controversial, Auburn presented no evidence that Mr Spencer advocates violence,” US district judge Keith Watkins ruled. He also wrote that to cancel Spencer’s speech “based on its belief that listeners and protest groups opposed to Mr Spencer’s ideology would react to the content of his speech by engaging in protests that could cause violence or property damage” was not a legal justification.

For Spencer, the University of Florida speech may be a chance to try to reset the conversation from the intense public condemnation that followed Charlottesville. A speech at Texas A&M University last year offered him the opportunity to garner new media attention after the outrage over Spencer’s choice to shout “Hail Trump! Hail Victory!” at a conference last November, which was met with Nazi salutes.

But his visit is also part of an ongoing white nationalist strategy to force public universities to serve as platforms for extreme racist ideas under the banner of freedom of speech.
