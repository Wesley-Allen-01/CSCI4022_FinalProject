One student was recorded as saying , “ The rockets are hitting Israel every day , really ? Good for them , let ’ s keep hitting Israel until they give their [ the Palestinians ] land back. ” In the letter , New York State assemblyman Douglas Smith , a Republican , wrote that “ this video shows nearly 200 students harassing , cursing , yelling , and physically destroying tables and displays put together by the College Republicans to promote this prestigious speaker and the event. ” “ During the video , students are threatened and physically intimidated for expressing their political views , including their support for the nation of Israel , ” he wrote.Mentioned in the letter was also the way in which students reacted “ when State University Police arrived to intervene. “ [ The ] angry mob of students begin chanting , ‘ No justice . No peace . No racist police. ’ They then proceed to get into the police officer ’ s face while screaming about how they believe it is within their first amendment rights to be violent , disruptive , and destructive of the property of others , ” he recalled.Smith , who is the Ranking Minority Member of the Assembly ’ s Committee on Higher Education , stressed that he would like to know “ what steps the college will be taking to promote inclusion and diversity on campus ; this includes diversity of political opinion. ” He added that “ the halls of academia should be a place for the free exchange of ideas. ” “ I am hopeful that you will actively work to ensure that State University of New York at Binghamton students are able to peacefully exercise their first amendment rights on campus without fear of physical violence in the future , ” he concluded.Following a response from the university to the letter , Smith said that he was “ very disappointed ” that the university seemed “ to excuse their students ’ bad behavior and blame the Binghamton College Republicans for ‘ triggering ’ their students with a Second Amendment poster. ” He warned that “ if the university fails to identify and take proper disciplinary action against these students , who had a temper tantrum and physically shut down their peers ’ ability to peacefully exercise their First Amendment Rights , they will be condoning violence against their own students. ” Smith stressed that there was no excuse for this behavior.Tommy Gagliano , a Binghamton student and editor-in-chief of The Binghamton Review , told ███ that he was in class when it happened , “ but saw it all over social media. ” “ It was a ridiculous overreaction to an innocent event , ” he said . “ Far-leftists saw ‘ Make America Great Again ’ hats and flipped. “ Pipe Dream , the school ’ s mainstream newspaper , then wrote an extremely dishonest story in which they spread a false narrative that the members of the College Republicans and Turning Point USA were promoting gun rights in response to a school shooting , ” he claimed.He said that in his opinion , people trying to frame the conservative students was beyond ridiculous.He said that The Binghamton Review , which promotes free speech and has typically attracted conservative and libertarian writers , made a point of speaking to people and gathering information that was not previously reported.Binghamton University College Republicans president John Restuccia recalled the incident , citing that the almost 200 students “ mobbed our tables , verbally harassed us , knocked over our tables , threw our materials and generally threatened and intimidated us. “ There is plenty of video evidence of these dangerous and potentially criminal actions by those who mobbed the area , ” he said in a statement released on Sunday night. “ It has been suggested that the incident in question occurred because we didn ’ t have proper permitting , ” he said . “ In the past , Turning Point USA and our organization have ‘ tabled ’ without any problems and weren ’ t required to secure any sort of permits.He emphasized that “ countless other organizations have similarly ‘ tabled ’ without a permit requirement. ” Restuccia called on the university “ to protect the First Amendment ” and demanded that the University “ take action against those who committed criminal behavior clearly evidenced in the video. ” In a statement , Binghamton University president Harvey G. Stenger noted the incident and the need for university police to get involved. “ Police response was appropriate and important to make sure that every student involved in this matter was safe and remained safe , ” he said . “ The incident ended and the crowd was able to be dispersed without anyone getting injured. ” Stenger called the incident unfortunate “ from all perspectives. “ As a University , we encourage everyone to consider the perspectives of others — and the damaging impact words and images can have — even if they are protected as free speech under the First Amendment , ” Stenger continued . “ We strongly condemn any acts that impede the expression of one ’ s beliefs but also encourage everyone on this campus to enter into meaningful interactions with respectful dialogue and actions . ”","A New York State assemblyman has slammed Binghamton University for the way it has handled a group of leftist students who verbally abused and ransacked tables belonging to the campus College Republicans group.The conservative students were handing out flyers for an upcoming talk by well-known economist Dr. Arthur Laffer when the incident occurred on Thursday.During the spat, the nearly 200 leftist students began yelling slurs, swearing at the conservative students and at one point, even brought up the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

College-aged students often do not agree with conservative political beliefs . But school officials believe that letting speeches by conservatives and others take place on campus can help lead to free and open debate .
But recent protests show that beliefs about free speech on college campuses may be changing .
Since February , protests have broken out at colleges across the country -- including the University of California-Berkeley , Middlebury College , the Claremont Colleges , and California State University , Los Angeles .
The protests started because conservative speakers were set to give talks about their beliefs .
Some people have criticized the protesters for trying to prevent controversial speakers from being heard .
Will Creely is the senior vice president of legal and public advocacy at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education ( FIRE ) . He told VOA that those who support free speech are worried about the protests . He says schools should work harder to protect speakers who may have different political beliefs than many students .
Last month , a student group at Middlebury College in Vermont invited Charles Murray to speak on the campus . Murray is a political scientist and a fellow with the conservative American Enterprise Institute . His research has linked race and intelligence .
The Southern Poverty Law Center calls Murray a white nationalist .
Hundreds of protesters shouted as Murray tried to speak . Officials moved him to another building , where he spoke with Professor Allison Stanger . His discussion with her was shown online .
College spokesman Bill Burger says that as Stanger and Murray left the building , they were “ physically and violently confronted by a group of protesters ” who “ set upon [ their ] car , rocking it , pounding on it , jumping on and trying to prevent it from leaving campus . ”
Stanger was taken to a hospital . She left wearing a neck brace . She said during the dispute with protesters , one of them grabbed her hair and pulled her backward .
In a message on Facebook , Stanger wrote : “ I feared for my life . ”
Earlier this month , students at Claremont McKenna College in California targeted Heather MacDonald . She is a researcher at the conservative Manhattan Institute and a well-known critic of the Black Lives Matter movement .
Students said they disagreed with a book MacDonald published last year called The War on Cops . In it , MacDonald wrote that police officers are afraid to do their work because of increased attention from reporters following the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson , Missouri in 2014 .
Brown , who is black , was killed by a white officer .
A student group invited MacDonald to speak on campus . But protesters stopped her from entering the building where she was to speak . She was forced to instead broadcast her speech on the internet . She did so from a room that was mostly empty ; protesters had blocked people from entering .
The protesters hit the room ’ s windows and shouted until MacDonald later said , “ the cops decided that things were getting too chaotic and I should stop speaking . ”
Police officers then had to help MacDonald leave the building so she could safely escape the protesters .
After her speech , more than 20 students signed a letter to David Oxtoby , one of the school ’ s presidents . They called MacDonald a “ fascist . ”
The letter demanded that the university “ take action ” against an independent student newspaper for its reporting on the protests and for its “ continual perpetuation of hate speech . ”
Oxtoby had previously condemned the protests and defended MacDonald ’ s right to speak on campus . He said the college supports “ the exercise of free speech and academic freedom . ”
The students said MacDonald is a well-known figure and her beliefs have been reported many times by the news media . They said refusing to let her speak did not violate her rights . And they said MacDonald being on campus is “ a form of violence . ”
Creely says incidents like the ones at Middlebury and Claremont are becoming increasingly common at American colleges . He called the trend “ deeply troubling . ”
Creely also criticized university officials for accepting the demands of students . He says the students do not know enough about laws that protect free speech in the United States .
He notes that “ there is no hate speech exception to the First Amendment . There is an unfortunately prevalent problem of students being unaware of the extent of their rights and the rights of their peers , ” he said .
In 2015 , the market research group YouGov asked students about free speech . In the opinion study , 43 percent of the students questioned said “ making sure that students have an environment free from discrimination , even if that means placing some limits on what students can say , ” should be more of a concern for colleges than protecting the “ absolute right to free speech . ”
Gallup did a similar study in 2016 . It found that 52 percent of students believe their college or university should stop people from speaking on campus who have a history of making hateful comments .
Forty two percent of students did not agree with the statement , however .
The debate about First Amendment rights continued earlier this month when the University of California-Berkeley canceled a planned speech by conservative writer and speaker Ann Coulter .
University officials said they were worried that police would not be able to control a possibly violent reaction to Coulter ’ s speech .
Riots took place at Berkeley earlier this year when conservative journalist Milo Yiannopoulos was invited to speak .
The riots caused $ 100,000 in damage to buildings on campus .
The school ’ s decision to cancel Coulter ’ s speech was criticized by many people . So officials changed their decision . They set a time for her to speak , but the time they set was one during which fewer people would be on campus .

free_speech,Washington Times,2,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jul/24/political-correctness-warriors-at-berkeley-could-e/,Political correctness warriors at Berkeley could end up criminalizing language,2019-07-24,Tammy Bruce,"The modern usage of the notion of “ political correctness ” that emerged along with the American civil rights movement seems quaint considering the naked efforts at censorship in today ’ s world wielded by social justice frauds .
The latest shenanigans in the liberal bastion of Berkeley , California , don ’ t surprise anyone . The Berkeley City Council unanimously decided to eliminate gender from its law books , changing how the city interacts with its citizens .
This , like most actions taken by the left , can be excused as a well-meaning gesture , but it ’ s not . This is about training people to accept legal changes in language promoting and codifying a political agenda .
The moment you allow partisans to change language , you are unlocking the door to politicians and activists working together to control everything you say , and ultimately criminalize language itself .
The New York Times reported on Berkeley ’ s latest effort at language control . “ Manhole will be replaced with maintenance hole . Sisters and brothers will be replaced with siblings and he or she will be banished in favor of they even if referring to one person , ” The Times said . “ The law would apply to traffic , health and safety regulations , garbage collection , environmental rules , construction permits , all of the business of the city . ”
Berkeleyside , a local news site , reported on the city ’ s bizarre effort , “ The rationale for this change states ‘ amending the municipal code to include gender-neutral pronouns by illuminating any gender preference language within the municipal code will promote equality. ’ ” This includes , by the way , referring to pregnant women now as “ pregnant employees , ” because “ equality , ” or something .
That , of course , is not true . Remember , the left usually tries to convince people to accept the absurd by inserting either “ It ’ s for the children , ” “ It ’ s for the whales , ” and the ubiquitous “ It ’ s for equality , ” because who can be against any of those things ?
The left has always been desperate to make contradicting them bigoted at least and ultimately illegal . One would think they would be more interested in persuading people on issues that matter to them . But even they believe they can ’ t . The left can not win discussions and debates on the issues , so their only solution is to silence non-conformists with assignments of bigotry and “ hate , ” hoping to silence and even ruin detractors .
“ In recent years , broadening societal awareness of transgender and gendernonconforming [ yes , they have that as one word ] identities has brought to light the importance of non-binary gender inclusivity . Therefore , it is both timely and necessary to make the environment of City Hall and the language of city legislation consistent with the principles of inclusion , ” CBS News reported .
We are assured by a representative for the city that Berkeley ’ s approximately 1,500 employees , according to The Times , “ are not obliged to follow the new rules and conversation . ”
And yet with this move , touted as something to make people feel more included , yet how safe would anyone in that environment feel simply using terms like “ he ” and “ she ? ” Part of the conditioning of an act like this is to brainwash others to see a person using regular gender pronouns as a bigot , expanding the existential danger of using an unapproved pronoun .
We know the left wants to make it impossible to escape condemnation and punishment of whatever they ’ ve determined to be racism , sexism , homophobia , bigotry in general , of everyone . And the only way to do that is to change the language and definitions .
The end goal of the left everywhere is to create an environment relying on fabricated language standards allowing for the arrest and/or ruination of those who use the wrong words or communicate in a way that someone finds offensive .
You think I ’ m going too far ? It ’ s already happening . In England this past December , the Daily Mail reported that a mom was arrested for calling a transgender activist a man .
Kate Scottow was arrested in front of her children and locked in a cell for seven hours after calling a transgender woman a man on Twitter , said the newspaper .
“ Three officers detained Kate Scottow at her home before quizzing at a police station about an argument with an activist on Twitter over so-called ‘ dead naming. ’ [ as an example , if one were to refer to Caitlyn Jenner as Bruce ] . The 38-year-old … had her photograph , DNA and fingerprints taken . … More than two months after her arrest … she has had neither her mobile phone or laptop returned which she said is hampering her studies for a masters in forensic psychology , ” the newspaper reported .
Make no mistake , this is where we ’ re headed — making it possible to ruin someone ’ s life for being rude .
Moreover , Human Events reported , “ A British doctor has been sacked from his government job following his refusal to refer to a hypothetical person described as a ‘ six-foot-tall bearded man ’ with feminine pronouns . Dr. David Mackareth … alleges that the topic of transgenderism and gender fluidity came up in a conversation with a line manager who asked him : ‘ If you have a man six foot tall with a beard who says he wants to be addressed as ‘ she ’ and ‘ Mrs , ’ would you do that ? … Describing it as an “ interrogation , ” the doctor claims his boss told him that it was ‘ overwhelmingly likely ’ he would lose his job unless he complied . ”
The doctor did not comply , was fired and is now suing , Human Events reported .
Refusing to allow the left to change the language doesn ’ t make you a bigot , it makes you someone who cares about the freedom in this country that all of us count on , especially minorities who rely on the government not being powerful , intrusive and controlling . That is our fight , especially as totalitarian control continues to be masked as “ tolerance . ”

The modern usage of the notion of “political correctness” that emerged along with the American civil rights movement seems quaint considering the naked efforts at censorship in today’s world wielded by social justice frauds.

The latest shenanigans in the liberal bastion of Berkeley, California, don’t surprise anyone. The Berkeley City Council unanimously decided to eliminate gender from its law books, changing how the city interacts with its citizens.

This, like most actions taken by the left, can be excused as a well-meaning gesture, but it’s not. This is about training people to accept legal changes in language promoting and codifying a political agenda.

The moment you allow partisans to change language, you are unlocking the door to politicians and activists working together to control everything you say, and ultimately criminalize language itself.

The New York Times reported on Berkeley’s latest effort at language control. “Manhole will be replaced with maintenance hole. Sisters and brothers will be replaced with siblings and he or she will be banished in favor of they even if referring to one person,” The Times said. “The law would apply to traffic, health and safety regulations, garbage collection, environmental rules, construction permits, all of the business of the city.”

Berkeleyside, a local news site, reported on the city’s bizarre effort, “The rationale for this change states ‘amending the municipal code to include gender-neutral pronouns by illuminating any gender preference language within the municipal code will promote equality.’ ” This includes, by the way, referring to pregnant women now as “pregnant employees,” because “equality,” or something.

That, of course, is not true. Remember, the left usually tries to convince people to accept the absurd by inserting either “It’s for the children,” “It’s for the whales,” and the ubiquitous “It’s for equality,” because who can be against any of those things?

The left has always been desperate to make contradicting them bigoted at least and ultimately illegal. One would think they would be more interested in persuading people on issues that matter to them. But even they believe they can’t. The left cannot win discussions and debates on the issues, so their only solution is to silence non-conformists with assignments of bigotry and “hate,” hoping to silence and even ruin detractors.

How does the Berkeley ordinance explain itself?

“In recent years, broadening societal awareness of transgender and gendernonconforming [yes, they have that as one word] identities has brought to light the importance of non-binary gender inclusivity. Therefore, it is both timely and necessary to make the environment of City Hall and the language of city legislation consistent with the principles of inclusion,” CBS News reported.

We are assured by a representative for the city that Berkeley’s approximately 1,500 employees, according to The Times, “are not obliged to follow the new rules and conversation.”

And yet with this move, touted as something to make people feel more included, yet how safe would anyone in that environment feel simply using terms like “he” and “she?” Part of the conditioning of an act like this is to brainwash others to see a person using regular gender pronouns as a bigot, expanding the existential danger of using an unapproved pronoun.

We know the left wants to make it impossible to escape condemnation and punishment of whatever they’ve determined to be racism, sexism, homophobia, bigotry in general, of everyone. And the only way to do that is to change the language and definitions.

The end goal of the left everywhere is to create an environment relying on fabricated language standards allowing for the arrest and/or ruination of those who use the wrong words or communicate in a way that someone finds offensive.

You think I’m going too far? It’s already happening. In England this past December, the Daily Mail reported that a mom was arrested for calling a transgender activist a man.

Kate Scottow was arrested in front of her children and locked in a cell for seven hours after calling a transgender woman a man on Twitter, said the newspaper.

“Three officers detained Kate Scottow at her home before quizzing at a police station about an argument with an activist on Twitter over so-called ‘dead naming.’ [as an example, if one were to refer to Caitlyn Jenner as Bruce]. The 38-year-old … had her photograph, DNA and fingerprints taken. … More than two months after her arrest … she has had neither her mobile phone or laptop returned which she said is hampering her studies for a masters in forensic psychology,” the newspaper reported.

Make no mistake, this is where we’re headed — making it possible to ruin someone’s life for being rude.

Moreover, Human Events reported, “A British doctor has been sacked from his government job following his refusal to refer to a hypothetical person described as a ‘six-foot-tall bearded man’ with feminine pronouns. Dr. David Mackareth … alleges that the topic of transgenderism and gender fluidity came up in a conversation with a line manager who asked him: ‘If you have a man six foot tall with a beard who says he wants to be addressed as ‘she’ and ‘Mrs,’ would you do that? … Describing it as an “interrogation,” the doctor claims his boss told him that it was ‘overwhelmingly likely’ he would lose his job unless he complied.”

The doctor did not comply, was fired and is now suing, Human Events reported.

Refusing to allow the left to change the language doesn’t make you a bigot, it makes you someone who cares about the freedom in this country that all of us count on, especially minorities who rely on the government not being powerful, intrusive and controlling. That is our fight, especially as totalitarian control continues to be masked as “tolerance.”

The Cuban Mission has already demanded an investigation into how the event was allowed to take place , having called it “ a political comedy staged on false arguments and with supporting actors of a dark history at the service of a foreign power . ”
“ It is part of the actions aimed at subverting the legitimately established constitutional order and of the interventionist agenda that has gained renewed momentum under the current administration , whose fascist , racist and xenophobic ideas are a matter of grave concern in the international community , ” the statement said .

He said the U.S. had done so with regards to Tuesday 's event . He also said that it is not the role of U.N. security to remove disruptive delegates unless they pose a physical threat .
Haley welcomed the Cuban call for an investigation and said that the the U.N. should also investigate the damage and the misconduct by the Cuban and Bolivian delegations -- include removing access to the U.N. for those responsible .

He pointed out that emerging online trends such as deepfakes , misinformation , and machine-learning-based ad targeting are accelerating at a rapid pace and threaten to warp political conversations . In a final tweet , Dorsey maintained that this is not a matter of free expression , but rather the way in which money amplifies speech . Business analysts estimate that money from political ads likely does not make up a large portion of Twitter ’ s revenue .
Twitter will release the details of the new policy on Nov. 15 and being enforcing it on Nov. 22 . The ban will apply to both ads purchased by campaigns and those having to do with political issues . Dorsey indicated that the company was concerned that allowing issue ads would create a loophole in the policy .

Williamson, Victor Davis Hanson, Jonah Goldberg, Yuval Levin","The Bard was replaced with a portrait of a black lesbian poet .
Students at the University of Pennsylvania have removed a portrait of Shakespeare from its Fisher-Bennett Hall and have replaced it with a picture of a black lesbian poet Audre Lorde in the name of “ diversity . ”
According to the Daily Pennsylvanian , a group of students removed the portrait and placed it in the office of English Department chairman Jed Esty after a department “ town hall meeting discussing the election ” on December 1 .

The Bard was replaced with a portrait of a black lesbian poet.

Students at the University of Pennsylvania have removed a portrait of Shakespeare from its Fisher-Bennett Hall and have replaced it with a picture of a black lesbian poet Audre Lorde in the name of “diversity.”

According to the Daily Pennsylvanian, a group of students removed the portrait and placed it in the office of English Department chairman Jed Esty after a department “town hall meeting discussing the election” on December 1. The Penn reports that the department had actually voted to replace the Shakespeare painting for “diversity” reasons several years ago, but that nothing had been done about it until after that specific meeting.

But does that mean that a portrait of one of the world’s most important literary figures has to be removed? Why not just add the Lorde portrait somewhere else?

Jack Shafer is Politico’s senior media writer.

If CNN reporter Jim Acosta is such a troublous force inside the White House Briefing Room—a “rude, terrible person” as President Donald Trump recently put it—deserving of being banned from White House grounds, then why did Trump and press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders routinely call on him during the televised question and answer periods at the White House over the past 22 months?

Had Acosta’s behavior truly offended them, Sanders and Trump could have permanently stifled the pesky reporter by treating him like a ghost, averting their gazes and picking other reporters during question time. Acosta couldn’t have done anything about it. Instead, Sanders and Trump regularly called on Acosta, counting on the likelihood that he would do that Acosta thing of speechifying and playing microphone hog as he attempts to turn a question into an extended back-and-forth. Sanders and Trump have pretended exasperation at Acosta’s posturing—posturing that hasn’t broken much news, by the way—but not so secretly they happily wallow in his pomposity. By getting Acosta to play the preening, self-aggrandizing, sanctimonious reporter and using him as the punching bag for the White House’s anti-press strategy, Sanders and Trump have created a unique public venue to exhibit their hatred for the “fake news” of CNN.

The TV moments created by Acosta's clashes—see the Guardian's reel of their best sparring matches—have served him, too. If you’re a fan of reporters who are better at lecturing than asking a question and think White House briefings and presidential press conferences should resemble the bloodsport of duels, then you probably find the Acosta clashes sufficiently enriching to make CNN your cable news destination.

Acosta’s forced exile and the lawsuit filed by CNN today demanding that Sanders and Trump return the “hard pass” that will allow him to roam the White House grounds have turned him into a free speech martyr, which I suppose he is. Like all First Amendment radicals, I deplore the Acosta ban and look forward to the day that he’s back in the White House making a pest of himself again. The case law cited in the suit by lawyer Theodore J. Boutrous, a top cock in the First Amendment bar’s pecking order, appears to prevent the White House from arbitrarily banning reporters from White House press facilities “for less than compelling reasons.” Even Fox News Channel’s legal analyst Andrew Napolitano predicts that the matter will be resolved “quickly“ in CNN’s favor.

The original charge Sanders made when barring Acosta—that he had placed “his hands” on the White House intern trying to retrieve his microphone during the presser—has been disproved. Today, attempting to argue against the CNN suit, Sanders shifted her rationale for the de-Acostafication of the White House, accusing him additionally and accurately for not surrendering the microphone when approached by the intern.

But as Sanders herself acknowledges, this was not the first time Acosta had resisted yielding the floor. So where is the common justice in ejecting him from White House grounds without so much as a warning? Sanders and Trump have thrilled in Acosta’s bad manners not only because his acting out helped personify their critique of CNN but also because it has made great TV drama for the president. Anything that’s good for ratings is good with Trump. It’s obvious from viewing the Acosta-Trump faceoff that Trump was spoiling for a fight—“Here we go,” Trump interrupted as Acosta began the wind-up on his first question—and started swinging back from the get-go. He wanted what Acosta was bringing so he could re-assume his old reality-TV role as the heavy who banishes the pretentious upstart. When the CNN lawsuit rolled in today, Trump must have clicked his heels in joy at the prospect of kicking Acosta and CNN around some more.

Televised White House briefings have always been political theater but under Trump’s management they’ve generated as much genuine news as a low-wattage kitchen microwave. The endless bickering between Sanders and the press corps and her obfuscations have become the story, much to the detriment of journalism. I wouldn’t go so far to call the briefings useless—they can connect reporters to otherwise hard-to-find facts and get the administration on the record—but for real news you have to rely on reporters like Maggie Haberman who spend little time in the daily briefings waiting for news to arrive.

Like so many episodes of The Trump Show, the martyrdom of Jim Acosta provides an entertaining sideshow. While it’s true that he’s more of a pain in the neck than a true newshawk, we can still call for his return to the White House briefing room in good conscience because being a pain in the neck is often a necessary part of the job. Besides, Sanders and Trump already miss him.

Liberals have given up on the idea of coming up with the best argument and now work tirelessly to silence their opposition so they can win the argument by default . Liberals NEED to do this because their ideas don ’ t work very well in the real world and if their ideas are tested and evaluated logically , they will be rejected by most people . So , how do they get around that ?
1 ) Libsplaining : For every guy out there mansplaining , there are probably 500 liberals libsplaining what some conservative supposedly REALLY MEANT at exactly the same time . If you ’ re conservative , pretty much anything you say will be reinterpreted by liberals to mean something totally different . Against welfare because you think it encourages people not to work ? You must hate black people . We need to cut wasteful government programs ? You despise poor people . You weren ’ t in love with Trump , but really didn ’ t like Hillary , so you voted for him ? You obviously want to turn America into Nazi Germany AND you hate women . None of this would be more than an annoyance except for the fact that liberals then take their completely nonsensical interpretation of what conservatives say and present it to the world as reality . This is how , for example , tens of millions of liberals who have probably never listened to Rush Limbaugh in their entire lives think he furiously spews lies and racist rants against the poor for three hours per day . Liberals seem to be practically incapable of taking common conservative beliefs at face value because that could lead them to intellectually engage in a debate about the best way to handle a problem , which could lead them away from liberal doctrine , which could….uh , YOU ’ RE A RACIST ! THAT ’ S WHY .
2 ) Violence : Why are the liberal fascists in ANTIFA violently protesting ? They ’ re violently protesting that people they disagree with are allowed to speak at all . Incidentally , “ people they disagree with ” runs the gamut from Nazis to mainstream conservatives . Ultimately , the liberals who send death and rape threats to conservative women like Dana Loesch and Michelle Malkin have the same goal as ANTIFA . They want to use the threat of violence to convince them to quit and to intimidate other women who agree with them . The limits on it are determined in large part by what they believe they can escape punishment for doing . Not every liberal will get violent , but violent groups like ANTIFA would be nothing without friendly police departments and college campuses that turn a blind eye to their activities . When they think they can get away with it , liberals are perfectly comfortable with using violence to silence their political opponents . Keep that in mind when they demand that you give up your guns .
3 ) De-Platforming : If a conservative puts his opinion out there , but no one is allowed to hear it , does it really matter ? Liberals have worked hard to take over newspapers , Hollywood and the schools not just to indoctrinate people with their views , but to make sure conservative views can ’ t get out . You ’ re now starting to see that same philosophy become more public at Twitter , Facebook , Google and YouTube ( Owned by Google ) as those social media giants become increasingly unfriendly ground for conservatives . If liberals can control whom you ’ re allowed to hear , they can control your thinking :
4 ) Political Correctness / Safe Spaces / Microaggressions : Safe spaces and microaggressions are the little sisters of political correctness , but they all serve the same purpose . They ’ re designed to silence people who say things liberals don ’ t like because “ Shut up , that ’ s why ! ” You saw a great example of this with James Damore at Google who used an open forum there to make scientifically supported arguments that liberals didn ’ t like about women in STEM and then was fired for it . That ’ s the perfect world for liberals . They win by default without having to defend their arguments at all because the other side isn ’ t allowed to say anything except liberal-approved talking points .
5 ) Liberal Fakes : Besides Fox News and a few conservative newspapers , it ’ s rare to see a genuine conservative presence in the mainstream media . The vast majority of people who bring you the “ conservative ” point of view in the MSM are weak-kneed moderates at best and liberals at worst . The role of these conservatives , who seldom have any real support on the Right , is to agree with liberals about how terrible Republicans are while occasionally making watered-down arguments about issues that won ’ t offend the Left too much . People like David Brooks , David Frum , Brett Stephens , Max Boot , Michael Gerson , Jennifer Rubin , Kathleen Parker , etc . are not there to represent conservatives ; they ’ re phonies there to give the false impression that even conservatives disagree with conservative policies .
6 ) False Labeling : In America , there are certain groups that the vast majority of us simply ignore . We don ’ t pay any attention to their arguments because nobody much cares what an actual white supremacist , Nazi , Fascist or racist has to say . So naturally , if you listen to liberals , other than them , pretty much everyone is a white supremacist , Nazi , fascist or racist .

Liberals LOVE to find someone you ’ re not supposed to criticize to stick up front when there ’ s a hot political issue . The latest ones are David Hogg and the other Parkland kids they ’ re putting on TV as much as possible to push for gun control . They make their arguments and…you ’ re not supposed to respond because other kids who may not have agreed with them at all , were killed .

WASHINGTON , D.C. — The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments today in a case that will significantly impact expression on Facebook , Twitter and other social networks . In filing an amicus brief in Anthony D. Elonis v. United States of America , The Rutherford Institute argues that the First Amendment protects even inflammatory statements that may give offense or cause concern to others unless the statements were a credible threat to engage in violence against another and made by the defendant with the intent to cause fear in the alleged victim .
The case arises out of Facebook postings made by Anthony Elonis expressing his anger about events in his life , and which were based upon rap lyrics of artists such as Eminem and a comedy sketch of the group The Whitest Kids U ’ Know . Elonis was charged with making unlawful threats ( it was never proven that he intended to threaten anyone ) and sentenced to 44 months in jail after he posted allusions to popular song lyrics and comedy routines on his Facebook page .
“ Whether it ’ s a Marine arrested for criticizing the government on Facebook or an ex-husband jailed for expressing his frustrations through rap lyrics on Facebook , the end result is the same—the criminalization of free speech , ” said John W. Whitehead , president of The Rutherford Institute and author of A Government of Wolves : The Emerging American Police State . “ While social media and the Internet have become critical forums for individuals to freely share information and express their ideas , they have unfortunately also become tools for the government to monitor , control and punish the populace for behavior and speech that may be controversial but are far from criminal . ”
Anthony Elonis was an active poster on Facebook who often used references to popular culture to express his views , feelings and frustration about events in his life . In May 2010 , after Elonis ’ wife left him and took his two children , he began listening to rap music and alluding to the sometimes violent lyrics of rap songs on his Facebook page . Elonis would couple these postings with statements acknowledging that the lyrics were fictitious and that he was simply exercising his First Amendment right of expression . After his estranged wife obtained a protection order against him , Elonis posted a reference to a comedy sketch of The Whitest Kids U ’ Know about threatening language that Elonis changed to include a reference about harming his wife . In another post , Elonis used the lyrics of Eminem in which the rap artist included fantasized thoughts about shooting up a school .
After federal agents were alerted to some of his postings , an investigator was sent to speak with Elonis .

WASHINGTON, D.C. — The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments today in a case that will significantly impact expression on Facebook, Twitter and other social networks. In filing an amicus brief in Anthony D. Elonis v. United States of America, The Rutherford Institute argues that the First Amendment protects even inflammatory statements that may give offense or cause concern to others unless the statements were a credible threat to engage in violence against another and made by the defendant with the intent to cause fear in the alleged victim.

The case arises out of Facebook postings made by Anthony Elonis expressing his anger about events in his life, and which were based upon rap lyrics of artists such as Eminem and a comedy sketch of the group The Whitest Kids U’ Know. Elonis was charged with making unlawful threats (it was never proven that he intended to threaten anyone) and sentenced to 44 months in jail after he posted allusions to popular song lyrics and comedy routines on his Facebook page.

“Whether it’s a Marine arrested for criticizing the government on Facebook or an ex-husband jailed for expressing his frustrations through rap lyrics on Facebook, the end result is the same—the criminalization of free speech,” said John W. Whitehead, president of The Rutherford Institute and author of A Government of Wolves: The Emerging American Police State. “While social media and the Internet have become critical forums for individuals to freely share information and express their ideas, they have unfortunately also become tools for the government to monitor, control and punish the populace for behavior and speech that may be controversial but are far from criminal.”

Anthony Elonis was an active poster on Facebook who often used references to popular culture to express his views, feelings and frustration about events in his life. In May 2010, after Elonis’ wife left him and took his two children, he began listening to rap music and alluding to the sometimes violent lyrics of rap songs on his Facebook page. Elonis would couple these postings with statements acknowledging that the lyrics were fictitious and that he was simply exercising his First Amendment right of expression. After his estranged wife obtained a protection order against him, Elonis posted a reference to a comedy sketch of The Whitest Kids U’ Know about threatening language that Elonis changed to include a reference about harming his wife. In another post, Elonis used the lyrics of Eminem in which the rap artist included fantasized thoughts about shooting up a school.

After federal agents were alerted to some of his postings, an investigator was sent to speak with Elonis. In response, Elonis posted rap lyrics he wrote containing fantasized language about having a bomb strapped to his body and doing violence to the agent. In response to these postings, the federal government charged Elonis under a statute making it a crime to transmit in interstate commerce any communication containing a threat to injure another. Elonis was convicted on four counts of violating this statute but appealed his conviction, arguing that the government should have been required to prove that he intended to threaten the alleged victims, not simply that the victims could reasonably have believed the words were “true threats.”

This snapshot in time was perfectly captured in one of the most famous commercials in TV history.

Set in a gray, dystopian future, row after row of men stare blankly at a giant screen from which Big Brother – the all-powerful leader from George Orwell's classic novel 1984 – addresses them.

Suddenly, riot police burst into the hall, chasing a beautiful, blonde woman in a white shirt and red shorts. Before they can grab her, she hurls a sledgehammer into the screen, shattering Big Brother and his grip on the masses. The narrator informs us that Apple's breakthrough product, the Macintosh computer, will be the device that sets us all free.

Looking back, Apple largely lived up to its promise. A new wave of companies, each in its own way, followed the example set by Apple's legendary CEO, Steve Jobs.

Google gave us instant access to vast amounts of information.

Facebook gave us a new way to connect with friends, family, and the world.

Twitter brought this world to us in real time.

And YouTube allowed anyone with a smartphone to become a virtual broadcast network unto themselves.

It was glorious and empowering.

But that was yesterday. Today, it's 1984 all over again. Big Brother is back – with an important twist.

Our former liberators now want to be our masters.

Apple, Google, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, the giants of social media, are demanding conformity to their values.

It's their way or the highway. Conform or die.

This image is perfectly captured not by an ad, but by this recent real-life scene: Row after row of men and women stare up at Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, as he makes a presentation – ironically – before a civil rights group.

""We only have one message for those who seek to push hate, division, and violence: You have no place on our platforms,"" Cook tells his audience. ""You have no home here.""

""Hate""? ""Division""? According to whom?

The answer is obvious: according to Apple, Google, YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter. They are becoming the Big Brother Orwell foresaw.

Conform or die.

Cook's ideas are exactly the same as his fellow chief executives at Google, YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter.

Disagree with Big Brother on, say, politics, or morality, and Big Brother will shut you up by shutting you down.

And what is it that Big Brother doesn't like?

Well, Tim Cook, said it: anything that doesn't conform to his left-wing worldview.

The examples are numerous and growing.

Meghan Murphy, a Canadian feminist, is permanently banned from Twitter for refusing to refer to the transgendered by their preferred pronoun, and for writing ""women aren't men.""

Google, Facebook and Twitter all at various times refused to carry political ads from Tennessee Republican candidate Marsha Blackburn, promoting her conservative views. She's hardly the only one this has happened to.

And, as many of you know, YouTube continues to restrict over 100 of PragerU's videos, finding them ""inappropriate for children."" These include titles like, ""Why Did America Fight the Korean War?""

Broad-based studies by the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology and by Northwestern University have confirmed what these examples clearly suggest: bias against conservatives at Google and other Big Tech sites.

And this is the bias we can plainly see. What we don't see, what Big Brother hides from us – what is referred to as ""shadow banning"" – may be even more pernicious.

If you're on the left, maybe you're okay with this. But if you're not on the left, or even if you are and you revere the First Amendment, you should be concerned. Very concerned. We are advancing swiftly toward an Orwellian, 1984 world of stifling, one-way-of-thinking conformity. This time, it's not a fictional story. It's real.

What's the solution? Simply return to the open market of ideas that served Big Tech so well for so long. Stop the censorship and let people make up their own minds. Otherwise America – and the rest of what has been known as the Free World – will cease to be free.

That's how serious the Big Tech threat is.

Portland Police Lieutenant Tina Jones said 1,200 people representing both sides took to downtown streets and that least 13 arrests were made. Authorities were mostly able to keep the conflicting groups apart through a series of protests and counterprotests lasting about nine hours. Six people suffered minor injuries, Jones said. “We know there is the possibility that assaults or other crimes occurred outside of the view of officers,” police said in a statement. “Officers and detectives will be spending the hours and days ahead writing reports, conducting interviews and pursuing investigations.”

Penis Ballerina organizer Joe Biggs claimed that his group wanted national attention, as they are stunt dummies who will do anything for the ’gram.

Phlegm Backwash’s biggest supporter, Trump, not only gave them national shine but his bitch ass took to Twitter to point out that Portland was “being watched very closely” and that his administration was considering naming the skinny vegans a terror group, something usually reserved for foreign organizations, USA Today reports.

free_speech,Guest Writer - Right,2,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/09/ideological-discrimination-colleges-universities-complicated/,Ideological Discrimination in Academia Is More Complicated than You Think,2019-09-09,"Musa Al-Gharbi, David French, Jordan Sillars, Jay Nordlinger, Kevin D. Williamson, Jonah Goldberg, Victor Davis Hanson, Yuval Levin","Faculty feel less threatened by the opinions of undergraduates than by those of Ph.D. students and their peers .
Many right-of-center students ( especially those who are grade-obsessed ) self-censor , fearing that their professors will punish them for their political and cultural views if they were to express them in class discussions or assignments .
It ’ s easy to understand why they are concerned . The dearth of ideological diversity in the professoriate is significant ; in social-research fields , the left-to-right ratio is roughly 10:1 . Professors rarely assign readings by conservative or libertarian intellectuals , let alone engage with such thinkers in a charitable way . Faculty regularly make off-topic jabs at Trump or the Republicans , or even end up digressing into full-on rants . Professors who are moderate and charitable in the classroom may post highly political content on social media ( or occasionally write highly political opinion pieces or blog posts ) expressing antipathy toward Republicans and conservatives . And all of this is amplified , and often distorted , by an outrage-driven media industry .
In a new study , three scholars examined the backgrounds , affiliations , and institutional perceptions of more than 7,200 undergraduate students at colleges nationwide and found that liberal students do tend to have closer relationships with faculty than do conservative students . Moreover , there was a gap between the grades of liberal students and conservative students , and the difference persisted even after controlling for things such as race , gender , socioeconomic status , and SAT scores , but the gap was very small : less than one-tenth of a point on a 4-point scale ( e.g. , less than the difference between a 3.0 and 3.1 GPA ) . That is , professors may be slightly biased in grading , but not so much that it is likely to change someone ’ s final letter grade for a course .
This finding may surprise some , because there is compelling evidence that professors and administrators do engage in ideological discrimination with respect to peer review , institutional review boards , admissions to Ph.D. programs , and faculty hiring and promotion . So what ’ s up with grading ? Is the issue that we just haven ’ t been measuring grading bias well enough ? Perhaps accusations of bias are overblown across the board ? Is there even reason to suspect that faculty are less likely to ideologically discriminate against undergraduates than against other groups ?
The first thing people should understand is that most instructors do not enjoy grading — and we really hate haggling with students about the grades we assign ( let alone with the parents or administrators they often drag into disputes ) . Nor do we want to get docked on our teaching evaluations by kids who turned in mediocre work but are mad they got a C .
Instructors also understand that the vast majority of students are just passing through higher-ed institutions on their way to something else . Undergraduates overwhelmingly identify getting a better job and earning more money as their primary reasons for attending college . Most students who obtain a bachelor ’ s degree stop there ; just over a third of those who complete a B.A . go on to get an advanced degree . Even most who complete graduate or professional degrees ( especially M.A.s , J.D.s , and M.D.s ) leave the academy thereafter .
Faculty are not interested in standing in their way . Quite the opposite : Many inflate grades , bend over backward to provide accommodations , and lower their workloads and standards to enable such students to flow through their classes and out into the world with minimal friction . Put another way : Instructors often avoid giving students the ( lower ) scores they deserve , let alone give them grades below what they deserve , simply because they disagree with them on a political matter .
Also , faculty don ’ t take disagreements with undergraduates particularly seriously to begin with . It is easy ( perhaps too easy ? ) for us to write off differences in perspectives as products of students ’ relative youth , inexperience , ignorance , or unexamined beliefs . We often simply assume that they would no longer hold the views they do — that their positions would be closer to our own — if they had read all that we ’ ve read and thought about issues as long as we have .
The situation is very different with respect to Ph.D. students and faculty . Their identities and worldviews are much more fully formed than those of undergrads . They are much more sophisticated in their thinking and possess a much deeper knowledge base . Consequently , it is much more difficult to simply dismiss their views . They have read many of the books and studies one would be inclined to throw at them — they may even be more familiar with recent work in their field — and can often point out errors , limitations , and counterevidence ( perhaps even with respect to one ’ s own work ) .
Ph.D. students are not nearly as transient as undergrads . Once admitted , doctoral candidates will be around the department for at least five years . They work much more closely with faculty than an undergrad typically does . Many will become colleagues in the discipline . Similarly , if a candidate is hired as an assistant professor , he or she will be around at least six to seven years as they work through the tenure track . Once they obtain tenure , they can stick around indefinitely . In short , disputes with Ph.D. students and faculty tend to be much more challenging to refute or ignore — and can be more persistent — than disagreements with undergraduates .
Ph.D. students and ( especially ) faculty can affect the trajectory of the field through their research . They can change how others ’ work is perceived by either challenging or reinforcing published findings . A professor can attract , cultivate , and mentor students to move the department — and the field — even further in his or her preferred direction . Such efforts can have important effects , positive or negative , on the credibility and impact of one ’ s own research . That , in turn , can affect one ’ s ability to recruit students , win grants , or publish subsequent research in top journals .
A lot more is at stake in the event of deep disagreements with Ph.D. students or ( especially ) peers , and faculty react accordingly . Most ideological discrimination by professors is against other faculty , in peer review and institutional review boards as well as in hiring and promotion decisions . There is some discrimination against Ph.D. students ( i.e . future faculty ) through admissions committees . With respect to undergrads , however , instructors have very little reason to discriminate in grading — and plenty of incentives not to .
Ideological bias within the academy is a real problem . It undermines the quality and impact of research and teaching . It needs to be addressed . However , grading is probably not a major way in which the bias is expressed . That leaves us with something like a “ good-news sandwich ” for students whose backgrounds and ideologies diverge from those of the dominant group :
The first bit of good news is that undergraduates are probably not being penalized much ( or at all ) by their professors for holding or expressing views that diverge from those of their professors .
The bad news is that if these students did decide to pursue a degree after their bachelor ’ s , they likely would face more discrimination in admissions , on the job market , in tenure committees , and when submitting research for IRB approval or peer review . The self-censoring may never end : Many faculty conceal their conservative or religious leanings — and avoid work on controversial topics — in order to preserve good relations with their left-leaning colleagues , avoid being targeted by student activists , and otherwise protect their professional standing . This is unfortunate , not least because their students and colleagues could benefit from exposure to different perspectives and ideas .
However , the final bit of good news is that , despite challenges , those conservatives who do stick with academia all the way to a professorship generally feel good about their career decisions and tend to enjoy their work about as much as their left-leaning peers do . So , rather than being discouraged and perhaps exiting the academy for think tanks , conservative and religious scholars should commit themselves to being part of the solution , to staying in the system , and to playing a constructive role in reforming institutions of higher learning . We ’ ll all be better off for it .

Faculty regularly make off-topic jabs at Trump or the Republicans, or even end up digressing into full-on rants. Professors who are moderate and charitable in the classroom may post highly political content on social media (or occasionally write highly political opinion pieces or blog posts) expressing antipathy toward Republicans and conservatives. And all of this is amplified, and often distorted, by an outrage-driven media industry.

But do liberal faculty actually demonstrate bias in grading?

In a new study, three scholars examined the backgrounds, affiliations, and institutional perceptions of more than 7,200 undergraduate students at colleges nationwide and found that liberal students do tend to have closer relationships with faculty than do conservative students. Moreover, there was a gap between the grades of liberal students and conservative students, and the difference persisted even after controlling for things such as race, gender, socioeconomic status, and SAT scores, but the gap was very small: less than one-tenth of a point on a 4-point scale (e.g., less than the difference between a 3.0 and 3.1 GPA). That is, professors may be slightly biased in grading, but not so much that it is likely to change someone’s final letter grade for a course.

This finding may surprise some, because there is compelling evidence that professors and administrators do engage in ideological discrimination with respect to peer review, institutional review boards, admissions to Ph.D. programs, and faculty hiring and promotion. So what’s up with grading? Is the issue that we just haven’t been measuring grading bias well enough? Perhaps accusations of bias are overblown across the board? Is there even reason to suspect that faculty are less likely to ideologically discriminate against undergraduates than against other groups?

It’s likely the latter. Let me explain.

The first thing people should understand is that most instructors do not enjoy grading — and we really hate haggling with students about the grades we assign (let alone with the parents or administrators they often drag into disputes). Nor do we want to get docked on our teaching evaluations by kids who turned in mediocre work but are mad they got a C.

Instructors also understand that the vast majority of students are just passing through higher-ed institutions on their way to something else. Undergraduates overwhelmingly identify getting a better job and earning more money as their primary reasons for attending college. Most students who obtain a bachelor’s degree stop there; just over a third of those who complete a B.A. go on to get an advanced degree. Even most who complete graduate or professional degrees (especially M.A.s, J.D.s, and M.D.s) leave the academy thereafter.

Faculty are not interested in standing in their way. Quite the opposite: Many inflate grades, bend over backward to provide accommodations, and lower their workloads and standards to enable such students to flow through their classes and out into the world with minimal friction. Put another way: Instructors often avoid giving students the (lower) scores they deserve, let alone give them grades below what they deserve, simply because they disagree with them on a political matter.

Also, faculty don’t take disagreements with undergraduates particularly seriously to begin with. It is easy (perhaps too easy?) for us to write off differences in perspectives as products of students’ relative youth, inexperience, ignorance, or unexamined beliefs. We often simply assume that they would no longer hold the views they do — that their positions would be closer to our own — if they had read all that we’ve read and thought about issues as long as we have.

The situation is very different with respect to Ph.D. students and faculty. Their identities and worldviews are much more fully formed than those of undergrads. They are much more sophisticated in their thinking and possess a much deeper knowledge base. Consequently, it is much more difficult to simply dismiss their views. They have read many of the books and studies one would be inclined to throw at them — they may even be more familiar with recent work in their field — and can often point out errors, limitations, and counterevidence (perhaps even with respect to one’s own work).

Ph.D. students are not nearly as transient as undergrads. Once admitted, doctoral candidates will be around the department for at least five years. They work much more closely with faculty than an undergrad typically does. Many will become colleagues in the discipline. Similarly, if a candidate is hired as an assistant professor, he or she will be around at least six to seven years as they work through the tenure track. Once they obtain tenure, they can stick around indefinitely. In short, disputes with Ph.D. students and faculty tend to be much more challenging to refute or ignore — and can be more persistent — than disagreements with undergraduates.

They can also be far more consequential.

Ph.D. students and (especially) faculty can affect the trajectory of the field through their research. They can change how others’ work is perceived by either challenging or reinforcing published findings. A professor can attract, cultivate, and mentor students to move the department — and the field — even further in his or her preferred direction. Such efforts can have important effects, positive or negative, on the credibility and impact of one’s own research. That, in turn, can affect one’s ability to recruit students, win grants, or publish subsequent research in top journals.

A lot more is at stake in the event of deep disagreements with Ph.D. students or (especially) peers, and faculty react accordingly. Most ideological discrimination by professors is against other faculty, in peer review and institutional review boards as well as in hiring and promotion decisions. There is some discrimination against Ph.D. students (i.e. future faculty) through admissions committees. With respect to undergrads, however, instructors have very little reason to discriminate in grading — and plenty of incentives not to.

Ideological bias within the academy is a real problem. It undermines the quality and impact of research and teaching. It needs to be addressed. However, grading is probably not a major way in which the bias is expressed. That leaves us with something like a “good-news sandwich” for students whose backgrounds and ideologies diverge from those of the dominant group:

The first bit of good news is that undergraduates are probably not being penalized much (or at all) by their professors for holding or expressing views that diverge from those of their professors.

The bad news is that if these students did decide to pursue a degree after their bachelor’s, they likely would face more discrimination in admissions, on the job market, in tenure committees, and when submitting research for IRB approval or peer review. The self-censoring may never end: Many faculty conceal their conservative or religious leanings — and avoid work on controversial topics — in order to preserve good relations with their left-leaning colleagues, avoid being targeted by student activists, and otherwise protect their professional standing. This is unfortunate, not least because their students and colleagues could benefit from exposure to different perspectives and ideas.

However, the final bit of good news is that, despite challenges, those conservatives who do stick with academia all the way to a professorship generally feel good about their career decisions and tend to enjoy their work about as much as their left-leaning peers do. So, rather than being discouraged and perhaps exiting the academy for think tanks, conservative and religious scholars should commit themselves to being part of the solution, to staying in the system, and to playing a constructive role in reforming institutions of higher learning. We’ll all be better off for it.

Minnesota forbids voters from wearing in a polling place political badges, buttons, or other insignia designed to “influence and impact” voting, or “promoting a group with recognizable political views,” even if the things worn do not refer to any candidate or issue on that day’s ballot. Nine other states have similar laws, and all 50 states have “speech-free zones” around polling places. Cilek’s T-shirt featured the Gadsden Flag (“Don’t Tread on Me”) and a small tea-party logo. He also sported a button, from a group worried about voter fraud, that read “Please I.D.

The Supreme Court has found no constitutional infirmity in campaign-free zones, but Minnesota’s law as Cilek experienced it seems to mandate a First Amendment-free zone, which he says is unconstitutionally overbroad. Minnesota has admitted that its law also would forbid apparel bearing the logos of, for example, the Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO, which do indeed have “recognizable political views.” These might (to use the language of campus speech police) “trigger” in people who see them. . . what? Political thoughts perhaps tangentially related to candidates or propositions on the ballot?

The statement , provided to The Wrap and quoted on Twitter by CNN writer Oliver Darcy , comes more than six hours after ███ first published an exclusive expose into New York Times ’ politics editor Tom Wright-Piersanti ’ s racist and antisemitic tweets . After ███ ’ original piece , Wright-Piersanti deleted many of the tweets admitting they were “ offensive ” and apologized .
I have deleted tweets from a decade ago that are offensive . I am deeply sorry . — Tom Wright-Piersanti ( @ tomwp ) August 22 , 2019
In his apology , he does not explain why the tweets were “ offensive ” and brushes off the comments as “ from a decade ago. ” The Times , through spokeswomen Danielle Rhoades-Ha and Eileen Murphy , has not replied to repeated requests for comment from ███ on whether they think his actions are enough , or whether Executive Editor Dean Baquet has become involved in this matter .
White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham told ███ exclusively in response to the first piece exposing Wright-Piersanti that she and the White House were “ disgusted ” by the comments he made about Jews and others .
“ I am disgusted but not surprised by this latest revelation out of the New York Times , ” Grisham said in a statement provided exclusively to ███ . “ Will there be consequences ? Doubtful . The New York Times is too busy weaponizing journalism to harass this President and the people who work for him to bother holding their own people accountable . ”
Wright-Piersanti has been criticized from all sides in the wake of these revelations , as has the New York Times . In a phone interview on Thursday , Zionist Organization of America ( ZOA ) president Mort Klein called on the Times to fire him immediately and launch an internal review of the newspaper ’ s hiring practices and editorial processes .
“ First of all , the New York Times should fire this editor immediately , ” Klein , a leading pro-Israel voice in America , said . Klein continued :
If he had come out with tweets making these types of remarks against blacks or gays or women , he ’ d be gone in a nanosecond . Why is there a different standard when you attack Jewish people ? So he should be fired immediately . With respect to the New York Times , the newspaper who for decades has been biased against and hostile to the Jewish state of Israel in article after article , editorial after editorial—a newspaper that only recently had the most vicious antisemitic cartoon , it should be a newspaper that is overly sensitive to refrain from appearing hostile to Jews and immediately take action against an antisemitic editor and make a public statement concerning this issue .
Murphy and Rhoades-Ha continue to refuse to answer whether the Times will proceed with a newspaper-wide review of editorial processes , hiring practices , and staff comments to determine if others exist in a place that has harbored Wright-Piersanti for more than five years despite these publicly available antisemitic and racist views . But Klein told ███ that given this , plus the Times ’ problems with antisemitic cartoons and other recent racist and antisemitic scandals inside the newspaper , a company-wide audit is a must–especially with rising antisemitism from leftist Democrats such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D-NY ) , Rashida Tlaib ( D-MI ) , and Ilhan Omar ( D-MN ) .
“ I think given the decades of bias and bigotry against the Jewish state that has come from the New York Times , it is time to do a serious audit to determine why almost all of their reporters and all of their editorial writers are openly hostile to the Jewish state , ” Klein said . Klein continued :
Their bigotry against Israel is so consistent , so pervasive , that it has to be more than a coincidence of some sort . They really should re-evaluate why they ’ re allowing this bias that they would never allow against blacks or gays or women or hispanics . Why are they allowing this against Jews ? In an era of rising antisemitism and attacks against Jewish people , and overt antisemitism from Congresswomen like Tlaib , Omar , and AOC , it is a time where the New York Times should be especially sensitive to not increasing enmity toward the Jewish state of Israel and the Jewish people .
Trump campaign adviser Katrina Pierson added that the Times should hire an outside counsel , an independent law firm , to conduct the company-wide review into antisemitism and racism pervasive throughout the newspaper .
“ Combined with other recent scandals like the publication of antisemitic cartoons and racist tweets that led to the demotion of another political editor in the Times ’ newsroom , it is long past time for the New York Times to hire an independent outside counsel legal firm to conduct a thorough review of the newspaper ’ s entire staff , hiring practices , and all editorial processes , ” Pierson told ███ .

It remains to be seen what will happen next , but now that the Times in its first statement on the matter has confirmed the tweets were a violation of its rules , action appears to be on the horizon .","A New York Times spokesperson has responded hours later to a Breitbart News investigation into racist and antisemitic comments one of its political editors made on Twitter, saying the comments violate the newspaper’s standards and it is considering what to do next.

NYT spokesperson: ""We are aware of these tweets, which are a clear violation of our standards. We are reviewing next steps."" https://t.co/jqlx9CrzbN — Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) August 22, 2019

The statement, provided to The Wrap and quoted on Twitter by CNN writer Oliver Darcy, comes more than six hours after Breitbart News first published an exclusive expose into New York Times’ politics editor Tom Wright-Piersanti’s racist and antisemitic tweets. After Breitbart News’ original piece, Wright-Piersanti deleted many of the tweets admitting they were “offensive” and apologized.

I have deleted tweets from a decade ago that are offensive. I am deeply sorry. — Tom Wright-Piersanti (@tomwp) August 22, 2019

In his apology, he does not explain why the tweets were “offensive” and brushes off the comments as “from a decade ago.” The Times, through spokeswomen Danielle Rhoades-Ha and Eileen Murphy, has not replied to repeated requests for comment from Breitbart News on whether they think his actions are enough, or whether Executive Editor Dean Baquet has become involved in this matter.

White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham told Breitbart News exclusively in response to the first piece exposing Wright-Piersanti that she and the White House were “disgusted” by the comments he made about Jews and others.

“I am disgusted but not surprised by this latest revelation out of the New York Times,” Grisham said in a statement provided exclusively to Breitbart News. “Will there be consequences? Doubtful. The New York Times is too busy weaponizing journalism to harass this President and the people who work for him to bother holding their own people accountable.”

Wright-Piersanti has been criticized from all sides in the wake of these revelations, as has the New York Times. In a phone interview on Thursday, Zionist Organization of America (ZOA) president Mort Klein called on the Times to fire him immediately and launch an internal review of the newspaper’s hiring practices and editorial processes.

“First of all, the New York Times should fire this editor immediately,” Klein, a leading pro-Israel voice in America, said. Klein continued:

If he had come out with tweets making these types of remarks against blacks or gays or women, he’d be gone in a nanosecond. Why is there a different standard when you attack Jewish people? So he should be fired immediately. With respect to the New York Times, the newspaper who for decades has been biased against and hostile to the Jewish state of Israel in article after article, editorial after editorial—a newspaper that only recently had the most vicious antisemitic cartoon, it should be a newspaper that is overly sensitive to refrain from appearing hostile to Jews and immediately take action against an antisemitic editor and make a public statement concerning this issue.

The remedy for hateful and offensive remarks , that 1990s-vintage argument went , was more speech—or logging off .
This principle , which can be traced back through the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas and John Stuart Mill , was nicely captured in the U.S. Supreme Court 's 1997 decision striking down certain speech-chilling provisions of the Communications Decency Act . `` Through the use of chat rooms , '' Justice John Paul Stevens wrote , `` any person with a phone line can become a town crier with a voice that resonates farther than it could from any soapbox . Through the use of Web pages , mail exploders , and newsgroups , the same individual can become a pamphleteer . ''
A generation later , Stevens ' argument has been not merely discarded . It has been inverted .
Politicians now insist that the internet should be subject to increased regulations precisely because it allows that hypothetical town crier to speak with a voice that resonates farther than it could from any physical soapbox . The possibility of freewheeling online discussions has been transformed , in other words , from virtue to vice . Platforms like Facebook and YouTube increasingly face demands that they restrict content . In some cases the demands are effected through public pressure , in others through outright government censorship .
The movement to stifle online expression is still in its early stages , but it represents a fundamental threat to the principles that have allowed the internet as we know it to grow and thrive . If these efforts continue , we may soon see the end of the free and open web .
At the vanguard of the efforts to restrict online speech are , ironically , Western nations that have historically prized free expression—in particular , the European Union .
In March , members of the European Parliament approved a Copyright Directive . What 's known as Article 13 of the measure ( renumbered as Article 17 in the final version ) will require technology companies to impose `` upload filters '' to scan user-provided content and remove material viewed as unlawful . If a service provider fails to delete `` copyright-protected works and other subject matter , '' the text says , it `` shall be liable for unauthorized acts of communication . ''
Internet pioneer Vint Cerf , World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee , Electronic Frontier Foundation co-founder John Gilmore , Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales , and dozens of other prominent technologists denounced Article 13 as `` an unprecedented step towards the transformation of the Internet from an open platform for sharing and innovation , into a tool for the automated surveillance and control of its users . ''
Their arguments failed . An amendment that would have removed the upload filter requirement from the Copyright Directive was defeated by five votes .
In the short term , that will probably grant an unintended competitive advantage to large U.S.-based companies such as Facebook , Google , and Twitter , which possess the resources to devise , test , and implement automatic filtering technologies . Smaller startups will find compliance more of a challenge . Nonprofit efforts such as Wikipedia and websites run by individuals are likely to shoulder even greater burdens .
Other E.U . measures include last year 's General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) , which imposed new rules on how businesses can handle and use user data , and this year 's so-called platform-to-business rules , announced in draft form in February . The latter step is less known but arguably reaches further : Slated to take effect in February 2020 , these regulations will control the business practices of `` online platforms , '' including search engines , voice assistants , app stores , online marketplaces , price comparison tools , and some social media applications . They will be subject to new rules , including a ban on such `` unfair practices '' as suspending a user 's account without explanation .
The French government applauded the draft rules in a statement , saying that the E.U . will now be able to `` steer the market in the right direction '' —though what the `` right direction '' is was left unsaid—while lamenting that they do not go further by regulating electronic devices too .
If Brexit actually happens and the U.K. manages to extricate itself from the European Union , Britain 's internet users and businesses will be fortunate to escape the full impact of these efforts . But Westminster 's elite have not been idle .
In April , the British government published a proposal , the `` Online Harms White Paper , '' that echoes the approach of the E.U . Copyright Directive by holding tech companies , in particular social media platforms , liable for what their users post or upload . Under such a legal regime , internet censorship would be effectively privatized , as businesses would have no choice but to monitor and restrict users .
Among the online `` harms '' the U.K. proposes to outlaw are `` extremist content , '' `` disinformation , '' `` violent content , '' and `` trolling , '' which could include anything from what a government agency decrees to be fake news to remarks critical of the Prophet Muhammad . Another offensive category is `` glamorization of weapons , '' which invites questions about how it may be applied to venerable British institutions like the National Museum of Arms and Armour , the nation 's oldest museum .
In an April op-ed for CNN , Jeremy Wright , the U.K. 's secretary of state for digital , culture , media , and sport , argued for this adventure in online censorship by likening , without irony , adult internet users to young children . `` It is similar to the principle that when you take your child to a playground , you trust that the builder made sure the equipment was safe and that no harm will come to them , '' Wright wrote .
The U.K. 's free market Adam Smith Institute calls the `` Online Harms White Paper '' illiberal and incompatible with English principles of freedom : `` This proposal is about preventing Internet users from engaging in knowing and voluntary speech , and it 's about recruiting vast armies of private sector policemen to patrol their thoughts . ''
Perhaps most problematic , the Adam Smith Institute points out , is that the U.K. proposes to restrict political speech that remains legal elsewhere in the English-speaking world . It is no exaggeration to say that `` glamorization of weapons '' is a popular hobby in the United States—and is fully protected by the American First and Second Amendments .
Other nations are edging in the same illiberal direction . Soon after the Christchurch , New Zealand , mosque massacre that killed 51 people , Australia enacted a new law punishing the publication or hosting of `` abhorrent violent material '' with up to three years in prison . According to the law , it `` is immaterial whether the hosting service is provided within or outside Australia . ''
Read broadly , this suggests that executives of U.S. and other foreign hosting services—at least those failing to strictly censor their services for Australian audiences—could face legal peril if they visited Sydney on vacation . The law also allows television stations to broadcast violent material while prohibiting Twitter users from posting an identical video online .
That was too much even for Australia 's Labor Party . `` There needs to be proper consultation with not just the social media sector but also traditional media , who are also caught up by this bill and whose legitimate journalism and online news sites will also be impacted on by these laws , '' said Mark Dreyfus , a Labor representative and former attorney general , during the parliamentary debate . Dreyfus warned the law was being rushed through Parliament for political reasons `` as this chaotic and desperate government careen [ ed ] toward '' an election this spring .
For his part , New Zealand 's Chief Censor David Shanks—yes , this is an actual government title—ruled that the video recorded by the Christchurch shooter and his accompanying manifesto both fell under the category of `` objectionable '' material and would be illegal to watch or read . The censorship office 's classification decision said the manifesto `` promotes and encourages acts of terrorism in a way that is likely to be persuasive to its intended audience . '' Merely viewing the document in electronic form , even if it is not downloaded to local storage , is punishable by up to 10 years in prison .
It is possible that New Zealand 's censorship will prevent further extremist violence . But it is more likely that a formal ban will turn the Christchurch shooter into a kind of free speech martyr , bringing more attention to his loathsome ideology . Forbidden ideas have a tendency to draw the curious and the untethered .
So far , at least , the U.S. government has yet to appoint a chief censor . But Silicon Valley 's coastal elites have been eager to volunteer their services gratis .
The last year has marked a dispiriting new low in the `` deplatforming , '' or banning from various online channels , of dissident voices . The ax fell on Infowars ' Alex Jones , actor James Woods , the editorial director of AntiWar.com , the director of the Ron Paul Institute , and radio talk show host Jesse Kelly . ( Some of these accounts have since been reinstated . )
Lawmakers have encouraged these social media bans . Congressional hearings have been called to interrogate tech execs on how their products are being used . Last August , Sen. Chris Murphy ( D–Conn . ) urged an even broader crackdown , proclaiming on Twitter that `` the survival of our democracy depends on it . ''
Rep. Bennie Thompson ( D–Miss . ) , chairman of the Homeland Security Committee , must have been listening . In March , Thompson sent a letter to Facebook , YouTube , Twitter , and Microsoft insisting that they remove `` toxic and violent '' content , even if it is legal to distribute in the United States . ( The platforms already prohibit illegal content . ) If the companies are `` unwilling '' to do so voluntarily , Thompson warned , Congress will `` consider policies '' to compel their cooperation . Left unexplained was how any such requirement could comply with the First Amendment .
The Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act , better known as FOSTA , ended the federal government 's laissez faire approach to internet companies when it was enacted in April 2018 . Executives are now criminally liable if they own , manage , or operate a service `` with the intent to promote or facilitate the prostitution of another person . '' The Electronic Frontier Foundation has filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of FOSTA , saying it muzzles constitutionally protected speech and is not tailored enough to comply with the First Amendment .
Whatever threats from constitutionally challenged politicians the United States faces , it remains a beacon of freedom compared to China , which can claim the dubious honor of most effective internet censor in the world . Social media apps are blocked , political content is restricted , and activists and journalists who document human rights abuses may be arrested and held in lengthy pretrial detention . Anonymity is impeded , with real names required .
The country 's constitution says that `` Citizens of the People 's Republic of China enjoy freedom of speech , of the press , of assembly , of association , of procession and of demonstration . '' But the reality is that the internet in China is almost entirely subservient to government whims .
As Freedom House , a nonprofit group advocating for political freedom , reports , `` websites and social media accounts are subject to deletion or closure at the request of censorship authorities , and Internet companies are required to proactively monitor and delete problematic content or face punishment . '' In addition , `` officials systematically instruct Internet outlets to amplify content from state media and downplay news , even from some state-affiliated media , that might generate public criticism of the government . '' Hundreds of popular websites are blocked by the country , including Google , Facebook , Whats-App , YouTube , Flickr , Tumblr , Dropbox , Instagram , SoundCloud , WordPress , and Pinterest .
In 2017 , China reinforced its control of the web with a law that increased censorship rules and , more worryingly , required that user data be stored on the Chinese mainland . `` Data localization , '' as it 's called , means that sensitive personal records will be easily available to police and intelligence agencies . U.S.-based companies such as Airbnb and Evernote dutifully moved Chinese user data to state-controlled companies . Last year Apple announced , without elaboration , that it was shifting iCloud operations for all its mainland Chinese customers to a government-owned local partner , Guizhou-Cloud Big Data Industry .
China is not alone in its efforts to control the internet . Instead , it is leading the way among authoritarian nations . Russia and Nigeria now have similar , though less comprehensive , data localization laws .
What nearly all of these extrusions of governmental interference have in common is that they focus their attention on the large internet companies that act as common platforms .
A small number of massive , slow-moving regulatory targets is a delightful state of affairs , at least from the perspective of Brussels or Beijing . It 's far easier to pressure a few huge multinationals equipped with risk-averse legal departments than it is to control millions of unpredictable internet users , some of whom are certain to ignore bureaucratic diktats—or to invent creative ways to circumvent them .
When the U.S. government decreed that encryption was a munition—essentially a dangerous weapon subject to federal rules for exporting arms and tanks—Microsoft and Netscape complied . But programmer-activists thumbed their noses at the rules by exporting the source code of popular PGP encryption protocols in book form . Others shrunk the RSA encryption algorithm to three lines of code in the Perl programming language , which they gleefully wore on T-shirts . The Justice Department declined to make an example of these scofflaws .
Today , there 's keen interest in homebrew gunsmithing , whether local laws permit it or not , thanks to online code repositories , such as GitHub and Defense Distributed 's DefCad . These sites offer design files that allow key components of working firearms to be manufactured at home using a 3D printer .
There is no natural law of computing that says search must be centralized in Google or Baidu , social networking must happen on Facebook or WeChat , auctions must go through eBay or Alibaba , and so on . What we 're accustomed to today represents a historic shift , one that 's difficult to overstate , from an earlier era of the internet . From the moment of its public release at 2:56 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time on August 6 , 1991 , the World Wide Web was meant to be decentralized . Anyone could browse from any connected device . Every person with the technological means could set up his or her own website . The gatekeepers were gone .
It 's true that centralized platforms have advantages , including improved security and better resistance to spam and abuse . They can also be quicker to build . But centralization brings costs with it , including providing a single convenient point of control for governments eager to experiment with censorship and surveillance .
There are some tantalizing hints that decentralization will return . Bitcoin and Ethereum , two blockchain-based computing platforms , are prominent examples . Solid—an open-source project backed by World Wide Web mastermind Berners-Lee—is intended to help you keep ownership of your own data by placing it under your control . The Internet Archive has hosted a pair of Decentralized Web Summits in San Francisco . Prototypes of distributed search engines , wikis , and Slack-like chat programs exist .
If a decentralized internet does return , it will likely arise only as a response to regulatory overreach by governments—and primarily because cryptonetworks provide developers and maintainers with economic incentives in the form of digital currency if they participate . A key advantage of open-source programming is developer friendliness : Twitter , especially , is notorious for disabling features that developers had relied on . Google 's feature killing is memorialized at KilledByGoogle.com . When no one owns a platform , that sort of thing is much less likely to happen .
Chris Dixon , an entrepreneur turned venture capitalist in Silicon Valley , wrote in a well-read February 2018 post on Medium : `` Today , unaccountable groups of employees at large platforms decide how information gets ranked and filtered , which users get promoted and which get banned , and other important governance decisions . In cryptonetworks , these decisions are made by the community , using open and transparent mechanisms . ''
Decentralization is hardly a perfect solution to the internet 's ills , but it 's likely to be better than the unhappy situation we find ourselves in today .","Not too long ago, conventional wisdom held that the internet should enjoy minimal government oversight precisely because it was a technology that enabled open and free speech for everyone. The remedy for hateful and offensive remarks, that 1990s-vintage argument went, was more speech—or logging off.

A generation later, Stevens' argument has been not merely discarded. It has been inverted.

Politicians now insist that the internet should be subject to increased regulations precisely because it allows that hypothetical town crier to speak with a voice that resonates farther than it could from any physical soapbox. The possibility of freewheeling online discussions has been transformed, in other words, from virtue to vice. Platforms like Facebook and YouTube increasingly face demands that they restrict content. In some cases the demands are effected through public pressure, in others through outright government censorship.

The movement to stifle online expression is still in its early stages, but it represents a fundamental threat to the principles that have allowed the internet as we know it to grow and thrive. If these efforts continue, we may soon see the end of the free and open web.

But it is more likely that a formal ban will turn the Christchurch shooter into a kind of free speech martyr, bringing more attention to his loathsome ideology. Forbidden ideas have a tendency to draw the curious and the untethered.

The United States of Deplatforming

So far, at least, the U.S. government has yet to appoint a chief censor. But Silicon Valley's coastal elites have been eager to volunteer their services gratis.

The last year has marked a dispiriting new low in the ""deplatforming,"" or banning from various online channels, of dissident voices. The ax fell on Infowars' Alex Jones, actor James Woods, the editorial director of AntiWar.com, the director of the Ron Paul Institute, and radio talk show host Jesse Kelly. (Some of these accounts have since been reinstated.)

Lawmakers have encouraged these social media bans. Congressional hearings have been called to interrogate tech execs on how their products are being used. Last August, Sen. Chris Murphy (D–Conn.) urged an even broader crackdown, proclaiming on Twitter that ""the survival of our democracy depends on it.""

Rep. Bennie Thompson (D–Miss.), chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, must have been listening. In March, Thompson sent a letter to Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Microsoft insisting that they remove ""toxic and violent"" content, even if it is legal to distribute in the United States. (The platforms already prohibit illegal content.) If the companies are ""unwilling"" to do so voluntarily, Thompson warned, Congress will ""consider policies"" to compel their cooperation. Left unexplained was how any such requirement could comply with the First Amendment.

The Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, better known as FOSTA, ended the federal government's laissez faire approach to internet companies when it was enacted in April 2018. Executives are now criminally liable if they own, manage, or operate a service ""with the intent to promote or facilitate the prostitution of another person."" The Electronic Frontier Foundation has filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of FOSTA, saying it muzzles constitutionally protected speech and is not tailored enough to comply with the First Amendment.

The World's Most Effective Censor

Whatever threats from constitutionally challenged politicians the United States faces, it remains a beacon of freedom compared to China, which can claim the dubious honor of most effective internet censor in the world. Social media apps are blocked, political content is restricted, and activists and journalists who document human rights abuses may be arrested and held in lengthy pretrial detention. Anonymity is impeded, with real names required.

The country's constitution says that ""Citizens of the People's Republic of China enjoy freedom of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of procession and of demonstration."" But the reality is that the internet in China is almost entirely subservient to government whims.

As Freedom House, a nonprofit group advocating for political freedom, reports, ""websites and social media accounts are subject to deletion or closure at the request of censorship authorities, and Internet companies are required to proactively monitor and delete problematic content or face punishment."" In addition, ""officials systematically instruct Internet outlets to amplify content from state media and downplay news, even from some state-affiliated media, that might generate public criticism of the government."" Hundreds of popular websites are blocked by the country, including Google, Facebook, Whats-App, YouTube, Flickr, Tumblr, Dropbox, Instagram, SoundCloud, WordPress, and Pinterest.

In 2017, China reinforced its control of the web with a law that increased censorship rules and, more worryingly, required that user data be stored on the Chinese mainland. ""Data localization,"" as it's called, means that sensitive personal records will be easily available to police and intelligence agencies. U.S.-based companies such as Airbnb and Evernote dutifully moved Chinese user data to state-controlled companies. Last year Apple announced, without elaboration, that it was shifting iCloud operations for all its mainland Chinese customers to a government-owned local partner, Guizhou-Cloud Big Data Industry.

China is not alone in its efforts to control the internet. Instead, it is leading the way among authoritarian nations. Russia and Nigeria now have similar, though less comprehensive, data localization laws.

Getting Back to Our Roots

What nearly all of these extrusions of governmental interference have in common is that they focus their attention on the large internet companies that act as common platforms.

A small number of massive, slow-moving regulatory targets is a delightful state of affairs, at least from the perspective of Brussels or Beijing. It's far easier to pressure a few huge multinationals equipped with risk-averse legal departments than it is to control millions of unpredictable internet users, some of whom are certain to ignore bureaucratic diktats—or to invent creative ways to circumvent them.

When the U.S. government decreed that encryption was a munition—essentially a dangerous weapon subject to federal rules for exporting arms and tanks—Microsoft and Netscape complied. But programmer-activists thumbed their noses at the rules by exporting the source code of popular PGP encryption protocols in book form. Others shrunk the RSA encryption algorithm to three lines of code in the Perl programming language, which they gleefully wore on T-shirts. The Justice Department declined to make an example of these scofflaws.

Today, there's keen interest in homebrew gunsmithing, whether local laws permit it or not, thanks to online code repositories, such as GitHub and Defense Distributed's DefCad. These sites offer design files that allow key components of working firearms to be manufactured at home using a 3D printer.

There is no natural law of computing that says search must be centralized in Google or Baidu, social networking must happen on Facebook or WeChat, auctions must go through eBay or Alibaba, and so on. What we're accustomed to today represents a historic shift, one that's difficult to overstate, from an earlier era of the internet. From the moment of its public release at 2:56 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time on August 6, 1991, the World Wide Web was meant to be decentralized. Anyone could browse from any connected device. Every person with the technological means could set up his or her own website. The gatekeepers were gone.

It's true that centralized platforms have advantages, including improved security and better resistance to spam and abuse. They can also be quicker to build. But centralization brings costs with it, including providing a single convenient point of control for governments eager to experiment with censorship and surveillance.

There are some tantalizing hints that decentralization will return. Bitcoin and Ethereum, two blockchain-based computing platforms, are prominent examples. Solid—an open-source project backed by World Wide Web mastermind Berners-Lee—is intended to help you keep ownership of your own data by placing it under your control. The Internet Archive has hosted a pair of Decentralized Web Summits in San Francisco. Prototypes of distributed search engines, wikis, and Slack-like chat programs exist.

If a decentralized internet does return, it will likely arise only as a response to regulatory overreach by governments—and primarily because cryptonetworks provide developers and maintainers with economic incentives in the form of digital currency if they participate. A key advantage of open-source programming is developer friendliness: Twitter, especially, is notorious for disabling features that developers had relied on. Google's feature killing is memorialized at KilledByGoogle.com. When no one owns a platform, that sort of thing is much less likely to happen.

Chris Dixon, an entrepreneur turned venture capitalist in Silicon Valley, wrote in a well-read February 2018 post on Medium: ""Today, unaccountable groups of employees at large platforms decide how information gets ranked and filtered, which users get promoted and which get banned, and other important governance decisions. In cryptonetworks, these decisions are made by the community, using open and transparent mechanisms.""

Decentralization is hardly a perfect solution to the internet's ills, but it's likely to be better than the unhappy situation we find ourselves in today.",www.reason.com,right,d2zHBAZE2UlYXknn

Abrams traces the two-century history of the First Amendment , from its creation in the Bill of Rights , ratified in 1791 , three years after ratification of the Constitution ( which took nearly a year after its publication by the Framers of Philadelphia ) , The Framers were disinclined to adopt a Bill of Rights , whose protections they regarded as implicit in the text of the Constitution . Framer Roger Sherman of Connecticut said of bills of rights : “ No bill of rights ever yet bound the supreme power longer than longer than the honey moon [ sic ] of a newly married couple. ” Fortunately , Mr. Madison prevailed over such skepticism .
Abrams cites the mid-century historian Clinton Rossiter , who described the 1787 Constitution as “ plain to the point of severity , frugal to the point of austerity , laconic to the point of aphorism. ” Madison stated that the “ great object ” of bills of rights is “ to limit and qualify the powers of government , by excepting out of the grant of power those cases in which the government ought not to act , or to act only in a particular mode. ” Madison believed courts would act as an “ impenetrable barrier ” to infringement of speech . But speech is now under a sustained assault not seen since the 1798 Sedition Act saw more than 20 newspaper editors jailed by President John Adams .
Because Abrams covers only the First Amendment , he ignores the Court ’ s seminal Bill of Rights case prior to 1925 , the year the Supreme Court began to selectively incorporate clauses , thus applying them to the States . Until then the case that defined its ambit was Barron v. Baltimore ( 1833 ) , in which Chief Justice John Marshall , our most influential Justice , authored the Court ’ s opinion holding that the Bill of Rights limited only the powers of the federal government . Indeed , it was not until 1939 ( NOT a misprint ) that the final trio of the original 13 colonies — Massachusetts ( Mar . 2 ) , Georgia ( Mar . 18 ) and Connecticut ( Apr . 19 ) — ratified the document many consider our true fundamental charter . This view is widely held because the Constitution ’ s text focuses on definition and distribution of powers , many arcane to non-lawyers ; the first ten amendments collectively called the Bill of Rights is a charter that mostly defines substantive constitutional rights , to many our secular Ten Commandments .
Abrams offers six chapters : ( 1 ) the history of free speech and the First Amendment over the past 226 years ; ( 2 ) comparison of free speech protection between America and the other Western democracies ; ( 3 ) how English free speech law was explicitly rejected by the Supreme Court in a landmark decision ; ( 4 ) comparison of relative protection of a right to be forgotten ; ( 5 ) comparison of regulation of spending in political campaigns ; ( 6 ) free speech issues that evade legislative and jurisprudential solution .
Abrams notes two emerging , divergent views on free speech protections . Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in his dissent as to free speech protection in the landmark 2010 Citizens United decision : “ The First Amendment advances not only the individual ’ s right to engage in political speech , but also the public ’ s interest in preserving democratic order in which collective speech matters. ” ( Italics in original . ) As rebuttal , Abrams cited Chief Justice Roberts in a later election free speech case , that “ … the will of the majority… plainly can include laws that restrict free speech . The whole point of the First Amendment is to afford individuals protection against such infringements. ” The case for new curbs on speech was carried further by former Harvard Law School Dean Kathleen Sullivan , who identified opposing visions of free speech : one protects only such speech as is perceived to advance political equality by protecting designated rights holders ; the other is negative , and bars the government from restricting speech , with a few very narrow exceptions . Sullivan supports the former , while Abrams supports the latter . Abrams follows the Framers ; Sullivan , postmodern jurisprudential values .
The dominant limitation of speech from the founding into the 1920s was censorship . Only with the jurisprudence of Justices Oliver Wendell Holmes and Louis D. Brandeis did protection of free speech , however unpopular , came to the fore . It was only in 1925 that the Frist Amendment was applied to the states ; and not until 1965 — NOT a misprint — did the Supreme Court rely upon the First Amendment to strike down a federal statute .
Abrams is very effective in contrasting the great degree to which speech remains protected in America , versus its creeping strangulation in Europe . Prime culprits are rulings by national courts and administrative tribunals , plus pan-European international bodies . He cites several recent decisions that would not have been made on our side of the Pond . Speakers have been convicted for such offenses as calling for an end to Muslim immigration ( Britain , Belgium ) ; for putting one ’ s country first ( Britain and Belgium again ) ; and attacking Christianity ( Poland ) . But it is criticism of Islam that is most ferociously punished today . Dutch parliamentarian and unsuccessful candidate for prime minister Geert Wilders was convicted for giving speeches calling for an end to Islamicization in Holland . This is the steep price of multicultural political correctness .
Another landmark protection for American speakers and writers came with passage of laws preventing enforcement against Americans of libel judgments issued by European courts ; militant Islamist plaintiffs had targeted authors whose works sold only a few copies overseas , suing in England rather than in the U.S. , to take advantage of European speech laws . Abrams counts 23 nations in the European Union that have criminal libel laws , with 20 of them including imprisonment penalties ; several have laws calling for greater punishment for libeling public officials .
In one major area even a free speech libertarian like Abrams draws at least a partial line : national security . He recounts that during the 1971 Pentagon Papers case ( in which a massive archive of Vietnam war decision-making was published by the New York Times and the Washington Post ) the Times withheld certain classified details . Earlier , in the 1950s the Times learned that the CIA was conducting secret reconnaissance overflights of the Soviet Union , and elected not to publish . Rampant disclosure of sensitive classified information is now close to a journalistic norm . While such may prevent abuses , which undeniably exist , they can also damage national security — “ sources and methods ” regarding intelligence collection , for example .
Perhaps most dangerous of all is the growing trend towards suppressing speech by resort to mass violence . Violence is contagious , if unchecked . Democrats were silent when Madonna said on Inauguration Day that she imagined the White House exploding ; when a rapper posted a video imagining President Trump being assassinated ; and some even defended the profanation of a Julius Caesar Shakespeare in the Park production in which Caesar dressed as Trump was stabbed to death . Such attitudes spawn violence not only against the right . California Democrats , much to their surprise , have received death threats from members of their hardcore leftist base , warning them not to cede to President Trump on health care .
Many remember vividly the tragic and terrifying events leading up to November 22 , 1963 , when President Kennedy was gunned down . For at least a year before that ghastly Friday of November 22 , right-wing extremists had openly preached violence against the president . The contagion had spread , but a radical leftist was the assassin . Violent and hateful rhetoric , far from being tamped down , escalated though the massively destructive race riots of 1964-1968 . The wave crested with the spring 1968 murders of Martin Luther King by a white racist , and of Senator Robert Kennedy by a Palestinian terrorist .
In what Abrams terms “ an historical irony ” the protections of the Bill of Rights have most often been invoked on behalf of leftist dissenters , yet it is the hardcore left that today aggressively moves to curtail such protections for speakers on the right .

Yet a social network is only as valuable as , well , its network . If everyone you know insists on using a certain service , you 're probably going to use that one , too . Even if you do n't personally use a particular network , if enough people in a country or planet do use it , then its policies and priorities could have a major impact on your life .
And then there 's the value of `` free speech '' on a conceptual level . If you hold free speech to be an ideal worth fighting for , you will push platforms to protect it , even if it is costly or inconvenient .
This is a conundrum that we did n't have to seriously deal with for a long time . In their early days , social-media platforms were `` open '' merely by virtue of their limited scale . Far fewer people used these websites , and the early adopters who did were largely internet-hardened veterans of forums and IRC channels who were not exactly allergic to a good flame war .
For years , social media platforms touted this openness as a key cultural and design feature of their services . Former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo famously characterized the microblogging platform as `` the free speech wing of the free speech party . '' Mark Zuckerberg marketed Facebook as a `` place where people across the world share their views and ideas . '' And of course Reddit has long positioned itself as a `` free speech site with very few exceptions '' —even when said speech was personally revolting to its operators . Only criminal acts , `` doxing , '' IP violations , and perhaps targeted harassment were grounds for platform intervention—and even then , in a limited fashion . Other than that , users were expected to generally work things out among themselves .
This ethos of voluntary collaboration and largely laissez faire moderation characterized early optimism about our odds with `` Web 2.0 , '' as perhaps best evidenced by Time magazine 's pick for the 2006 Person of the Year : `` YOU , '' meaning all of the people who were commenting and vlogging and sharing and liking the mass of newly-generated digital content for the first time . Our future was no longer shaped primarily by `` conflict or great men , '' wrote Time 's Lev Grossman . Rather , our destiny laid in `` community and collaboration on a scale never seen before '' and `` the many wresting power from the few and helping one another for nothing…that will not only change the world , but also change the way the world changes . ''
It was a pretty picture . Unshackled by the physical restraints of paper , ink , and film , a new breed of dynamic infovores would to produce a plethora of reports and opinions on events around the clock . Walls would be broken down and new perspectives could finally see the light . Media gatekeepers would be more of a luxury—for style and sophistication—than a necessity to deliver a solid product . Children could learn Greek on YouTube ! New businesses could be launched from a blog ! The revolution—at least those amenable to U.S. foreign policy goals—would be live-Tweeted ! Do n't like it ? Do n't click . Or maybe start a change.org petition if you 're really fired up .
Initially , the social Internet seemed to deliver the promise of pure online voluntaryism so long theorized by libertarians . And in terms of delivering content and communication , it 's worked pretty well . We have more access to more media on more subjects than ever before .
But it is clear now that the relative harmony of early online platforms did not scale very well . As more people with radically diverse beliefs and backgrounds joined in , clashes and controversy were sure to follow . Today , one person 's `` free speech '' is too often another 's `` bigotry . ''
One decade on from Grossman 's love letter to the social web , we can we can observe `` the few '' struggling mightily to wrest power back from `` the many '' —and apparently being heartily cheered on by the crowds in the process . Many of the new features that social media networks roll out these days are tools for blocking controversial content and promoting more sanitized fare . Administrators act less like neutral platform providers , blind and agnostic to the value of user content , and more like editorial curators . In a way , social-media platforms have not so much `` disrupted '' the old media gatekeepers as they have merely introduced a watered-down version of the same concept .
Perhaps social media 's evolution from darling of decentralization to glorified kindergarten cop should have been obvious from the get go . Technology is only a tool . It can amplify or dampen user taste , but rarely fundamentally change it . If 40 percent of your core user base supports censoring certain types of content , you will probably need to build tools that will censor certain types of content .
The vision of a web that is fundamentally open and voluntary was a beautiful one , but perhaps one that erroneously projected its proponents ' tastes and backgrounds onto more humans than it actually appealed . Those who value the rough-and-tumble world of an uncensored Internet can still find that in particular private havens across the web . But web Balkanization is here to stay , and most people will choose a sanitized version of digital reality .","Reddit has suffered a rocky year, having weathered months of censorship concerns and subreddit shutdowns.

And then there's the value of ""free speech"" on a conceptual level. If you hold free speech to be an ideal worth fighting for, you will push platforms to protect it, even if it is costly or inconvenient.

This is a conundrum that we didn't have to seriously deal with for a long time. In their early days, social-media platforms were ""open"" merely by virtue of their limited scale. Far fewer people used these websites, and the early adopters who did were largely internet-hardened veterans of forums and IRC channels who were not exactly allergic to a good flame war.

For years, social media platforms touted this openness as a key cultural and design feature of their services. Former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo famously characterized the microblogging platform as ""the free speech wing of the free speech party."" Mark Zuckerberg marketed Facebook as a ""place where people across the world share their views and ideas."" And of course Reddit has long positioned itself as a ""free speech site with very few exceptions""—even when said speech was personally revolting to its operators. Only criminal acts, ""doxing,"" IP violations, and perhaps targeted harassment were grounds for platform intervention—and even then, in a limited fashion. Other than that, users were expected to generally work things out among themselves.

This ethos of voluntary collaboration and largely laissez faire moderation characterized early optimism about our odds with ""Web 2.0,"" as perhaps best evidenced by Time magazine's pick for the 2006 Person of the Year: ""YOU,"" meaning all of the people who were commenting and vlogging and sharing and liking the mass of newly-generated digital content for the first time. Our future was no longer shaped primarily by ""conflict or great men,"" wrote Time's Lev Grossman. Rather, our destiny laid in ""community and collaboration on a scale never seen before"" and ""the many wresting power from the few and helping one another for nothing…that will not only change the world, but also change the way the world changes.""

It was a pretty picture. Unshackled by the physical restraints of paper, ink, and film, a new breed of dynamic infovores would to produce a plethora of reports and opinions on events around the clock. Walls would be broken down and new perspectives could finally see the light. Media gatekeepers would be more of a luxury—for style and sophistication—than a necessity to deliver a solid product. Children could learn Greek on YouTube! New businesses could be launched from a blog! The revolution—at least those amenable to U.S. foreign policy goals—would be live-Tweeted! Don't like it? Don't click. Or maybe start a change.org petition if you're really fired up.

Initially, the social Internet seemed to deliver the promise of pure online voluntaryism so long theorized by libertarians. And in terms of delivering content and communication, it's worked pretty well. We have more access to more media on more subjects than ever before.

But it is clear now that the relative harmony of early online platforms did not scale very well. As more people with radically diverse beliefs and backgrounds joined in, clashes and controversy were sure to follow. Today, one person's ""free speech"" is too often another's ""bigotry.""

One decade on from Grossman's love letter to the social web, we can we can observe ""the few"" struggling mightily to wrest power back from ""the many""—and apparently being heartily cheered on by the crowds in the process. Many of the new features that social media networks roll out these days are tools for blocking controversial content and promoting more sanitized fare. Administrators act less like neutral platform providers, blind and agnostic to the value of user content, and more like editorial curators. In a way, social-media platforms have not so much ""disrupted"" the old media gatekeepers as they have merely introduced a watered-down version of the same concept.

Perhaps social media's evolution from darling of decentralization to glorified kindergarten cop should have been obvious from the get go. Technology is only a tool. It can amplify or dampen user taste, but rarely fundamentally change it. If 40 percent of your core user base supports censoring certain types of content, you will probably need to build tools that will censor certain types of content.

The vision of a web that is fundamentally open and voluntary was a beautiful one, but perhaps one that erroneously projected its proponents' tastes and backgrounds onto more humans than it actually appealed. Those who value the rough-and-tumble world of an uncensored Internet can still find that in particular private havens across the web. But web Balkanization is here to stay, and most people will choose a sanitized version of digital reality.",www.reason.com,right,tbzOqLUEudlay00S

Twitter says the new labels would be applied to tweets that may be threatening violence , engaging in `` targeted harassment , '' or inciting others to do so . ( June 27 ) AP , AP
WASHINGTON – Sen. Kamala Harris on Tuesday repeated her call for Twitter to suspend President Donald Trump 's account , sending a formal letter to the company 's CEO Jack Dorsey that said Trump 's attacks on the whistleblower who helped sparked an impeachment inquiry violate the site 's rules .
`` I write to call your attention to activity that President Trump has been engaged in on his Twitter account , which appears to violate the terms of the user agreement that your company requires all users on the platform adhere to , '' she said at the opening of her letter .
Harris pointed to tweets Trump posted in the past week that `` target , harass , and attempt to out the whistleblower who set forth credible allegations that the President has abused his power by urging a foreign government to investigate a domestic political rival . ''
The whistleblower 's complaint alleges Trump pressured the Ukrainian government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son , Hunter Biden , in what many Democrats say was an abuse of power .
`` Look let 's be honest , @ realDonaldTrump 's Twitter account should be suspended , '' reads the pinned tweet on the California Democrat 's account page .
`` Hey @ Jack . Time to do something about this , '' Harris tweeted at Dorsey on Tuesday after Trump tweeted that the impeachment inquiry against him is a `` coup '' attempt designed to `` take away '' Americans ' `` God-given rights . ''

Look let 's be honest , @ realDonaldTrump 's Twitter account should be suspended . — Kamala Harris ( @ KamalaHarris ) October 1 , 2019
In the letter , Harris cited tweets in which Trump said a `` leaker or spy '' or `` partisan operative '' was behind the complaint and when he said the whistleblower 's identity should be revealed to him . She said it was important to put the tweets in context because Trump had implied the whistleblower was a `` 'spy ' who may have committed treason , and further implied that the punishment should be death . ''
In addition . she said Trump had used tweets to intimidate the person who may have given the whistleblower information and to accuse House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff of treason .

Harris also pointed to a tweet in which Trump quoted a pastor who said his removal from office could lead to civil war .
`` These are blatant threats . We need a civil society , not a civil war , '' Harris said . `` These tweets represent a clear intent to baselessly discredit the whistleblower and officials in our government who are following the proper channels to report allegations of presidential impropriety , all while making blatant threats that put people at risk and our democracy in danger . ''
She said Twitter had suspended other users for similar violations , including InfoWars host Alex Jones and conservative actor James Woods .
`` Others have had their accounts suspended for less offensive behavior . And when this kind of abuse is being spewed from the most powerful office in the United States , the stakes are too high to do nothing , '' she wrote .

Twitter says the new labels would be applied to tweets that may be threatening violence, engaging in ""targeted harassment,"" or inciting others to do so. (June 27) AP, AP

WASHINGTON – Sen. Kamala Harris on Tuesday repeated her call for Twitter to suspend President Donald Trump's account, sending a formal letter to the company's CEO Jack Dorsey that said Trump's attacks on the whistleblower who helped sparked an impeachment inquiry violate the site's rules.

""I write to call your attention to activity that President Trump has been engaged in on his Twitter account, which appears to violate the terms of the user agreement that your company requires all users on the platform adhere to,"" she said at the opening of her letter.

Harris pointed to tweets Trump posted in the past week that ""target, harass, and attempt to out the whistleblower who set forth credible allegations that the President has abused his power by urging a foreign government to investigate a domestic political rival.""

The whistleblower's complaint alleges Trump pressured the Ukrainian government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, in what many Democrats say was an abuse of power.

""Look let's be honest, @realDonaldTrump's Twitter account should be suspended,"" reads the pinned tweet on the California Democrat's account page.

""Hey @Jack. Time to do something about this,"" Harris tweeted at Dorsey on Tuesday after Trump tweeted that the impeachment inquiry against him is a ""coup"" attempt designed to ""take away"" Americans' ""God-given rights.""

Look let's be honest, @realDonaldTrump's Twitter account should be suspended. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) October 1, 2019

In the letter, Harris cited tweets in which Trump said a ""leaker or spy"" or ""partisan operative"" was behind the complaint and when he said the whistleblower's identity should be revealed to him. She said it was important to put the tweets in context because Trump had implied the whistleblower was a ""'spy' who may have committed treason, and further implied that the punishment should be death.""

In addition. she said Trump had used tweets to intimidate the person who may have given the whistleblower information and to accuse House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff of treason.

Harris also pointed to a tweet in which Trump quoted a pastor who said his removal from office could lead to civil war.

""These are blatant threats. We need a civil society, not a civil war,"" Harris said. ""These tweets represent a clear intent to baselessly discredit the whistleblower and officials in our government who are following the proper channels to report allegations of presidential impropriety, all while making blatant threats that put people at risk and our democracy in danger.""

She said Twitter had suspended other users for similar violations, including InfoWars host Alex Jones and conservative actor James Woods.

""Others have had their accounts suspended for less offensive behavior. And when this kind of abuse is being spewed from the most powerful office in the United States, the stakes are too high to do nothing,"" she wrote.

""No user, regardless of their job, wealth, or stature should be exempt from abiding by Twitter’s user agreement, not even the President of the United States.""

America and American are offensive.

This is not my view. But an early version of a document compiled by the “Inclusive Communications Task Force at Colorado State University” actually singled out the words “America” and “American” as being potentially offensive. Here is the actual language used in the draft:

“The Americas encompass a lot more than the United States. There is South America, Central America, Mexico, Canada and the Caribbean just to name a few of 42 countries in total. That’s why the word ‘americano’ in Spanish can refer to anything on the American continent. Yet, when we talk about ‘Americans’ in the United States, we’re usually just referring to people from the United States. This erases other cultures and depicts the United States as the dominant American country.”

The conclusion in that draft was to replace “America” and “American” with “U.S. citizen” or “person from the U.S.”

You can’t make this stuff up. I mean really. What were they thinking?

Colorado State University Chancellor Tony Frank issued an official statement after the story broke defending the policy as being voluntary and saying that the final version did not include America or American. Within his statement, he said, “We consider free speech and the First Amendment the foundations of a great American public university.” Sounds nice, but how did America and American make the list in the first place?

Here is the introductory language in the original document:

“Inclusive Language Guide

“Living Document — Updates made frequently

“What this document is: This is a living resource compiled by the Inclusive Communications Task Force at Colorado State University. The document is intended to serve as a best practices guide. It is provided and will be updated with the intention of sharing meaningful and useful language suggestions. It is worth noting that language is always evolving so this document will be updated periodically.

“What this document is not: This is not an official policy or required practice. This document is intended as a resource to help our campus community reflect our Principles of Community particularly inclusion, respect, and social justice.

“The language in the guide may not apply to every individual and it is critical to take personal preference into account. The guide is not about political-correctness or policing grammar, but rather helping communicators practice inclusive language and helping everyone on our campus feel welcomed, respected, and valued.”

Instead of spending so much time worrying about ways not to offend anyone, it would be nice if our colleges and universities actually worried about teaching our students. Since 1978, college tuition has gone up 1,125 percent - four times the rate of inflation, while actual time in the classroom by tenured professors teaching undergraduates has gone down.

While we’re at it, It would be nice if the staff at our colleges and universities focused on ways to teach our students objective American history, basic economics and financial literacy. It seems that too many of the left-wing college professors and administrators have led large numbers of our young people to believe that America is a land of inequality (if they even say America anymore), capitalism is unjust and their generation is getting a raw deal.

Ironically, the opposite is true. No generation in human history has ever experienced a world with more prosperity, more freedom, more leisure time, more access to information, higher literacy rates, better life expectancy, lower child mortality, less poverty, less disease, less hunger and less violent crime that the current generation.

It is part of the reason I am so excited to be the president-elect of Young America’s Foundation. We have the truth on our side. We just need to get it out to our young Americans.

But it will not be easy. Even though the words “America” and “American” were not included in the latest version of the Inclusive Communications Task Force document, the fact that they even made an earlier draft — and the reasoning behind it — should wake us all up to the tremendous bias (intentional or not) on our campuses.

The motto of our nation is E pluribus unum (Out of many, One). People still come from all over the world to seek the freedom and prosperity found only in America.

Part of the greatness of our United States is that anyone can claim that freedom and prosperity. It doesn’t matter what class you were born into, what your parents did for a living, where you live or what you look like; everyone of us is created equal. As the U.S. Constitution says, endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.

What we do with those blessings is up to each of us. And that, is part of what makes me proud to be an American.

You need to do a better job of self-regulating",2018-08-31,Jim Hanson,"President Trump is speaking forcefully about fixing a growing problem affecting our national discourse . He says we may need to regulate the giant tech companies that control vast swaths of our information landscape , due to their bias .
The president tweeted this week : “ Google search results for ‘ Trump News ’ shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake New Media . In other words , they have it RIGGED , for me & others , so that almost all stories & news is BAD . Fake CNN is prominent . Republican/Conservative & Fair Media is shut out . Illegal ? ”
Google , Facebook and Twitter all claim they do not purposely discriminate due to political viewpoints . But it is increasingly clear that this is the outcome – whatever their intentions . Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey admitted his firm suffers from left-leaning bias and must do more work to ensure it doesn ’ t affect Twitter .
The question then becomes , what can President Trump do to affect this ?
The first thing is exactly what the president has been doing – using the bully pulpit to influence the social media companies to change their behavior .
Government intervention should occur only as a last resort , because this would infringe on free speech and expression .
The social media firms need to take it upon themselves to solve the problems they have created , in many cases due to their own success .
Google , Facebook and Twitter dominate the online world in the same way that ABC , CBS and NBC dominated the world of television prior to cable TV . There are really no alternatives to these social media companies . That gives them great power , but also great responsibility . Thus far they have done better wielding the first than honoring the second .
Hopefully , the social media companies will heed the president ’ s warning , but if not , what can he do ?
In this election season , the president could direct the Federal Election Commission to investigate the practices of the social media companies . The commission could examine whether suppressing conservative ideas – including in some cases the accounts of Republican candidates – constitutes an in-kind contribution to the Democratic Party and its candidates .
Security Studies Group submitted a complaint to the Federal Election Commission asking for this type of investigation into Twitter with a reference to the Fact Sheet on Viewpoint Discrimination we compiled .
Another avenue is to have the Federal Communications Commission look at the immunity granted to the social media companies as Internet service providers under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act .
This immunity for the companies exempts them from defamation lawsuits , because they are considered to be distributors of content rather than publishers that exert editorial control . It is reasonable to consider whether the amount of control these companies exert in deciding what content is available – or not available – changes this status .
Google , Facebook and Twitter are private companies . They have the right to have policies to promote liberal ideas and ban conservative ones from their platforms . But as publicly traded companies , they have a responsibility to speak honestly about their business practices . They can ’ t have their CEOs saying they do not discriminate if it can be shown they do .
President Trump could ask the Securities and Exchange Commission to examine whether the three companies are misleading their shareholders and the public .
There is also a question of whether the success of the social media companies has made them indispensable for businesses , organizations and many individuals . If so , there is the possibility that they could be declared to be public utilities and regulated that way to prevent discrimination .
This regulation has been imposed previously on electric power and telephone companies . If there is no alternative to their service and they are denying service to some businesses , organizations and individuals that is a legitimate government concern .
The goal here should not be to find ways for government to insert itself into the digital town square as some kind of referee . But right now , the public discourse is being limited and the social media companies are refusing to fairly serve some of their customers .

Such coercion , the court held , would violate the fundamental principle that `` an individual has autonomy over his or her speech and thus may not be forced to speak a message he or she does not wish to say . ''
The court ruled in favor of Joanna Duka and Breanna Koski , owners of Brush & Nib Studio , who were under threat of up to six months of jail time , $ 2,500 in fines , and three years of probation for each day the city would find them in violation of the law .
Alliance Defending Freedom ( ADF ) attorneys representing the two artists filed suit against the city because it interprets its law in a way that illegally controls artistic expression and disregards religious liberty . The court agreed and found that the law violates the freedom of Duka and Koski to express messages consistent with their religious beliefs through their custom wedding invitations .
As ███ News reported back in January , the law made it illegal for business owners to deny service to same-sex couples on the basis of religion . The pair specialize in creating custom artwork using hand painting , hand lettering , and calligraphy to celebrate weddings and other events .
Duka and Koski say they 'll serve anyone , regardless of sexual preference – but they draw the line at producing custom messages that violate their Christian beliefs .
`` The government should n't threaten artists with jail time and fines to force them to create custom artwork , such as wedding invitations , expressing messages that violate their beliefs , and that 's what the court has affirmed today , '' said ADF Senior Counsel Jonathan Scruggs , who argued on behalf of Duka and Koski before the Arizona Supreme Court .
`` Joanna and Breanna work with all people ; they just do n't promote all messages . They , like all creative professionals , should be free to create art consistent with their convictions without the threat of government punishment . Instead , government must protect the freedom of artists to choose which messages to express through their own creations . The court was right to find that protections for free speech and religion protect the freedom of creative professionals to choose for themselves what messages to express through their custom artwork . ''
But back in June of 2018 , the Arizona Court of Appeals ruled against the two artists , noting that `` antidiscrimination ordinances are not aimed at the suppression of speech but at the elimination of discriminatory conduct . ''
However , the Arizona high court found that the Phoenix law violates Duka and Koski 's free speech protections under the state constitution and their free exercise rights under Arizona 's Free Exercise of Religion Act .
`` The rights of free speech and free exercise , so precious to this nation since its founding , are not limited to soft murmurings behind the doors of a person 's home or church , or private conversations with like-minded friends and family , '' the court wrote in its decision in Brush & Nib Studio v. City of Phoenix .
`` These guarantees protect the right of every American to express their beliefs in public . This includes the right to create and sell words , paintings , and art that express a person 's sincere religious beliefs . With these fundamental principles in mind , today we hold that the City of Phoenix… can not apply its Human Relations Ordinance…to force Joanna Duka and Breanna Koski…to create custom wedding invitations celebrating same-sex wedding ceremonies in violation of their sincerely held religious beliefs . ''
`` So this case is not about whether businesses can decline to serve an entire class of people . It is about whether artists can freely choose which messages their own art conveys , '' the ADF attorneys explained to the court during the case .
According to the ADF , Phoenix interprets its ordinance , City Code Section 18-4 ( B ) , in a manner that forces artists , like Duka and Koski , to use their artistic talents to celebrate and promote same-sex marriage in violation of their beliefs , even when they decide what art they create based on the art 's message , not the requester 's personal characteristics . The ordinance also bans them from publicly communicating what custom artwork they can and can not create consistent with their faith .
`` We are pleased that the city can no longer enforce its ordinance in a manner that violates freedom of expression or the ability of Joanna and Breanna to live and work consistently with their faith , '' Scruggs said . `` Joanna and Breanna will now be able to create custom wedding invitations and to communicate about their beliefs without fear of government punishment , as any artist should be free to do .

Does that kind of government inquiry sound familiar ? Are we not less than a year removed from an IRS apology for inquiring about the internal workings of conservative groups ?
Last week , FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai , who believes the government has no role in how a certain story is covered , disclosed in a Wall Street Journal Op-Ed the existence of the new FCC plan that will ostensibly “ study ” how media organizations report the news .
Last May the FCC proposed an initiative to thrust the federal government into newsrooms across the country . With its `` Multi-Market Study of Critical Information Needs , '' or CIN , the agency plans to send researchers to grill reporters , editors and station owners about how they decide which stories to run . A field test in Columbia , S.C. , is scheduled to begin this spring .
The purpose of the CIN , according to the FCC , is to ferret out information from television and radio broadcasters about `` the process by which stories are selected '' and how often stations cover `` critical information needs , '' along with `` perceived station bias '' and `` perceived responsiveness to underserved populations . ''
The news was jarring , so I downloaded the FCC ’ s “ Research Design ” and read it for myself .
What I found was even more disturbing than what Mr. Pai reports .
If radio and television stations resist coughing up confidential employee data ( including demographic information ) to aid the FCC monitors , the study also ( on pages 10 and 11 ) provides helpful “ strategies ” for obtaining information -- even when employers and their Human Resources departments refuse to cooperate .
How reassuring that the federal government is devising new ways to violate the privacy of reporters , editors and their employers – all to make sure news outlets are providing Americans with the news the Obama administration says they “ need . ”
The roadmap to censorship is clear . Expect this study to show that some news organizations are failing to cover the “ right ” stories – thus failing to give the people what they “ need . ”
Then , the FCC – which owns the airwaves – will propose to swoop in and fix the “ market failure ” by making sure that Americans learn what they “ need ” to learn – regardless of their own preferences .
And what does the FCC prioritize ? If its list is any indication , it prioritizes the “ environment ” far above the “ weather , ” while war news barely makes the list .
So I suppose when storms are brewing it ’ s more important that I learn about carbon credits than where a tornado might touch down ? And just don ’ t you worry about what ’ s happening in our war against jihadists .
Given the Obama administration ’ s consistent and publicly-expressed loathing for ███ , expect to see the news lineup the Obama administration says America needs to look a lot more like MSNBC ’ s nonstop coverage of climate change and “ bridgegate ” than Fox ’ s rightful focus on lost American lives in Benghazi .
From its inception , the Obama administration has proven that it ’ s not only intolerant of critics , but that it will use the full power of an increasingly partisan bureaucracy to intimidate Americans and rein in dissent . The administration turned the IRS on the Tea Party , it unleashed the Department of Justice on wayward reporters , and now the FCC is preparing to snoop into America ’ s television and radio studios .
In an era of divided government , it ’ s sometimes difficult to stop Obama administration excess , but this call to action should be easy : Under no circumstances should the House of Representatives allocate even a single dime of taxpayer money to authorize or empower government monitors in any newsroom in America .","The FCC is launching a new study, taking upon itself the task of deciding what news the public “needs” to hear, versus the news the public wants to hear.

With its ""Multi-Market Study of Critical Information Needs,"" or CIN, the agency plans to send researchers to grill reporters, editors and station owners about how they decide which stories to run. A field test in Columbia, S.C., is scheduled to begin this spring.

The purpose of the CIN, according to the FCC, is to ferret out information from television and radio broadcasters about ""the process by which stories are selected"" and how often stations cover ""critical information needs,"" along with ""perceived station bias"" and ""perceived responsiveness to underserved populations.""

The news was jarring, so I downloaded the FCC’s “Research Design” and read it for myself.

[pullquote]

What I found was even more disturbing than what Mr. Pai reports.

If radio and television stations resist coughing up confidential employee data (including demographic information) to aid the FCC monitors, the study also (on pages 10 and 11) provides helpful “strategies” for obtaining information -- even when employers and their Human Resources departments refuse to cooperate.

How reassuring that the federal government is devising new ways to violate the privacy of reporters, editors and their employers – all to make sure news outlets are providing Americans with the news the Obama administration says they “need.”

The roadmap to censorship is clear. Expect this study to show that some news organizations are failing to cover the “right” stories – thus failing to give the people what they “need.”

Then, the FCC – which owns the airwaves – will propose to swoop in and fix the “market failure” by making sure that Americans learn what they “need” to learn – regardless of their own preferences.

And what does the FCC prioritize? If its list is any indication, it prioritizes the “environment” far above the “weather,” while war news barely makes the list.

So I suppose when storms are brewing it’s more important that I learn about carbon credits than where a tornado might touch down? And just don’t you worry about what’s happening in our war against jihadists.

Given the Obama administration’s consistent and publicly-expressed loathing for Fox News, expect to see the news lineup the Obama administration says America needs to look a lot more like MSNBC’s nonstop coverage of climate change and “bridgegate” than Fox’s rightful focus on lost American lives in Benghazi.

From its inception, the Obama administration has proven that it’s not only intolerant of critics, but that it will use the full power of an increasingly partisan bureaucracy to intimidate Americans and rein in dissent. The administration turned the IRS on the Tea Party, it unleashed the Department of Justice on wayward reporters, and now the FCC is preparing to snoop into America’s television and radio studios.

In an era of divided government, it’s sometimes difficult to stop Obama administration excess, but this call to action should be easy: Under no circumstances should the House of Representatives allocate even a single dime of taxpayer money to authorize or empower government monitors in any newsroom in America.

A University Stands Up for Free Speech — and Itself","On the Yale University campus, 2009 (Reuters photo: Shannon Stapleton)

Here’s why they're wrong.

There are a few ways to respond to radical demands for campus censorship.

One is rather simple: Enforce decades of constitutional jurisprudence, and clearly signal to disruptive protesters that lawbreaking is grounds for serious discipline. Follow the law and the debate about free speech won’t end, but the wave of shout-downs will pass. Students, after all, don’t want to sacrifice their shot at a degree to stop, say, Ben Shapiro or Charles Murray from speaking. As a general rule, they’ll do what the college allows them to do, and nothing more.

The extraordinary letter , disclosed by the Daily Beast , comes from two top Biden campaign advisers . They ask the editorial chiefs of all main TV networks and cable news channels to desist from booking Giuliani .

“ By giving him your air time , you are allowing him to introduce increasingly unhinged , unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation . ”
Giuliani has been an almost ubiquitous feature on network and cable news shows since news broke that an anonymous whistleblower had filed a complaint alleging that Trump was trying to solicit the help of the Ukraine government in his 2020 re-election bid .

Though Giuliani became a figure of national unity in the wake of 9/11 as “ America ’ s Mayor ” , he has become a symbol of the extreme partisan divide that has opened up under Trump .
His pronouncements on the Ukraine matter have grown increasingly shrill , to the point that some pundits have wondered whether he is “ melting down ” .
He called a fellow guest on Fox News a “ moron ” and an “ idiot ” . He denied to Chris Cuomo of CNN that he had asked Ukraine to investigate Biden , then said “ of course I did ” 30 seconds later .
He has also invoked wild conspiracy theories involving Hillary Clinton , the philanthropist George Soros and other rightwing bogey figures .
But the most consistent theme in his outlandish on-air comments has been his attempt to smear Biden , who for months has been a leading contender for the Democratic nomination to challenge Trump in the presidential election next year .
On ABC ’ s This Week on Sunday he repeated claims that in 2016 the then vice-president pressured Ukraine to fire its chief prosecutor because he was investigating corruption in a gas company on whose board sat Biden ’ s son , Hunter .

It’s about power.,2016-08-26,"Kevin Gannon, Jen Kirby, Li Zhou, Aja Romano, Anna North, Dylan Matthews, Ian Millhiser","A letter from the University of Chicago ’ s dean of students to the incoming students of the class of 2020 has been making the rounds on social media the past few days . Its purpose , I guess , was to let those students know they were in for a real education . More of a full-on broadside than a welcome letter , the dean let the incoming students know that the university is totally committed to academic freedom and `` freedom of expression '' from its faculty and students .
What this means in practice , the letter continues , is that `` we do not condone the creation of intellectual ‘ safe spaces ’ where individuals can retreat from ideas and perspectives at odds with their own . '' And , if you ’ ve watched students at other campuses , the dean warns , don ’ t get any crazy ideas about protesting invited speakers : `` we do not cancel invited speakers because their topics might prove controversial . '' And , for the love of Milton Friedman , `` Our commitment to academic freedom means we do not support so-called ‘ trigger warnings. ’ '' WE ARE A MIGHTY RACE OF INTELLECTUAL WARRIORS .
I ’ ve been teaching on the college level for 18 years , and I also direct my university ’ s Teaching and Learning Center , so I ’ ve been following the debate over `` trigger warnings , '' `` safe spaces , '' and the purported scourge of `` political correctness '' for quite a while . Despite the apocalyptic tone that often accompanies screeds against supposedly coddled students and their trigger-free safe spaces , the issues involved strike me as far more complicated than the overheated rhetoric suggests .
As with any conversation about teaching and learning , context and nuance matter greatly — but they ’ re not present in most of the critics ’ attempted takedowns of trigger warnings ( better called `` content advisories , '' in my estimation ) or safe spaces .
Students deserve much more credit than they get in the UChicago letter
I ’ m dismayed by how diatribes like the Chicago letter approach students in adversarial terms , implying that they don ’ t know how to make choices or approach material when it comes to their learning . Our students deserve more credit than they get in these types of polemics ; as I ’ ve argued elsewhere , they are far from the coddled , entitled softies that they ’ re often painted as . Rather than obsessing about a cartoonish version of what some hypothetical Oberlin graduate might say , we ought to engage with our students as the real and complex people that they actually are .
As you might imagine , though , there ’ s been a wave of support from the usual quarters for the Chicago letter and its sentiments ; I assume that ’ s what such a blatant attempt at elitist posturing was aiming for in the first place . On the surface , the points seem hard to argue with .
Academic freedom is the sine qua non of higher education . Students ought to be challenged , even made uncomfortable , in order to learn in deep and meaningful ways . And , of course , collegiate education is where students must encounter perspectives different from their own . No one who genuinely believes in higher education is going to dispute any of that . And that ’ s what this dean and the anti-trigger-warnings , no-safe-spaces crowd are counting on — that the surface veneer of reasonableness in these admonitions to the class of 2020 will obscure the rotten pedagogy and logical fallacies that infest this entire screed .
Even the timing of this missive raises questions . Why go full blast against this purported scourge of wimpy , touchy-feely educational malpractice right up front ? Is there a safe-spaces petition percolating in the ranks of the first-years ? Are the dean and the university worried that people will lose respect for the almighty maroon if they didn ’ t stake out the tough-guy intellectual turf from the beginning ? Did they sit around and ask themselves what Milton Friedman would have done ?
From the outside , it looks like a lot of smoke without much heat . I suspect that this letter is not intended as an orientation statement , but rather a public rebuke to what its authors see as a threat to their vision of what higher education ought to be . It ’ s not a welcome letter , it ’ s a manifesto looking for an audience .
And as a statement of principle , the letter — as does much of the general argument against trigger warnings and safe spaces — relies on caricature and bogeymen rather than reason and nuance . The document comes from a place , I imagine , where the true defenders of Academic Rigor™ man the parapets against the encroaching legions of namby-pamby liberals who want to coddle students instead of teach them .
Ohhh , you want a safe space so the mean nasty Truths of the world won ’ t hurt your wittle feewings . You want to be `` warned '' before we discuss `` sensitive '' subjects . WELL HEY JUNIOR , `` WAR AND PEACE '' HAS WAR IN IT . If you don ’ t like it , go sit on the quad and sing `` Kumbayah '' with the other flower children .
That ’ s the specter that arguments like this conjure up : The greatest threat to genuine academic freedom comes from within . Coddled students who are used to getting trophies for everything don ’ t want to engage with stuff they don ’ t like , so they wrap themselves in entitlement and demand trigger warnings to protect their feelz . Or they want safe spaces to hide from the big , bad world . Or they want the university to cancel a lecture because the speaker is from the wrong demographic . And if universities don ’ t make a stand against this foolishness , Western Civilization itself will collapse .
That ’ s a comforting narrative to the academic elite who feel like they ’ re faced with an existential crisis . Rather than seeing themselves as clinging to the last vestiges of the 1950s , they get to paint themselves as staunch advocates of all that is good and worthy . And there ’ s an audience for this fiction — people still read Allan Bloom . But as critiques of inequality have shown time and again , when you ’ re accustomed to privilege , equality feels like oppression . I don ’ t think it ’ s a coincidence that the backlash against so-called `` political correctness '' in higher education has intensified in direct variation with the diversification of the academy , areas of scholarship , and — most significantly — the student population .
What ’ s really behind the hand-wringing : the gatekeepers want to remain in place
Underlying much of the hand-wringing about the state of the academy is a simple desire to have the gatekeepers remain in place . The perception of the threat is entirely out of alignment with the reality on the ground . For every ginned-up hypothetical scenario of spoiled brats having a sit-in to protest too many white guys in the lit course , there are very real cases where trigger warnings or safe spaces aren ’ t absurdities , but pedagogical imperatives .
If I ’ m teaching historical material that describes war crimes like mass rape , shouldn ’ t I disclose to my students what awaits them in these texts ? If I have a student suffering from trauma due to a prior sexual assault , isn ’ t a timely caution the empathetic and humane thing for me to do ? And what does it cost ? A student may choose an alternate text I provide , but this material isn ’ t savagely ripped out of my course to satiate the PC police .
To move from the hypothetical to the real , the Virginia Tech students who protested their university ’ s invitation to Charles Murray to deliver a lecture weren ’ t some sort of intellectual gestapo , they were members of a community calling out other members ’ violation of the community ’ s ethos .
Murray is a racist charlatan who ’ s made a career out of pseudoscientific social Darwinist assertions that certain `` races '' are inherently inferior to others . To bring him to campus is to tell segments of your student community that , according to the ideas the university is endorsing by inviting Murray , they don ’ t belong there . This isn ’ t a violation of academic freedom . It ’ s an upholding of scientific standards and the norms of educated discourse — you know , the type of stuff that colleges and universities are supposed to stand for , right ?
These two examples — one centered in an individual classroom and the other involving institutional decisions — speak to the diversity and complexity of the issues involved . It ’ s easy to inveigh against silly scenarios . It ’ s much harder to address real things that really happen . Do I tell my student that , even though she was the victim of a brutal assault in her past , she must read testimony of gang-rape survivors in my course in order to uphold the sacred values of free intellectual inquiry ?
Sure , Charles Murray has a right to his views . But is it okay for us to use student fees paid in part by African-American students to bring him to campus , fête him , and give him a rostrum to tell those students they ’ re doomed by genetics to be inferior to whites ? Well , he makes a strong argument and isn ’ t bound by conventional `` niceties . '' Yes , that ’ s true . But that ’ s also the reason people claim to like Donald Trump , and I don ’ t see universities lining up to bring him in as a guest lecturer .
Ignoring the complexity of real-life situations is a common accusation hurled at academics and the academy in general . Why on earth would we be so eager , in this case , to prove those accusations true ? To prevent imaginary sit-down strikes against Victorian literature , we ’ re willing to force students into a predetermined path where to deviate is to compromise academic integrity ? Are we so scared of losing the intellectual heft of our curricula that we want to muzzle our students and deprive them of agency ?
Or are we just afraid of our students challenging us and holding us accountable to the very values we profess ?
Our first reaction to expressions of student agency should not be to shut them down
As a faculty member , I would be enormously dismayed if my dean sent this letter to my incoming students . Because now they ’ ll come into my class already having received a clear message about what my institution seems to value — and it isn ’ t them .
The Chicago letter reeks of arrogance , of a sense of entitlement , of an exclusionary mindset — in other words , the very things it seeks to inveigh against . It ’ s not about academic freedom ; it ’ s about power . Know your place , and acknowledge ours , it tells the students . We ’ ll be the judge of what you need to know and how you need to know it . And professors and students are thus handcuffed to a high-stakes ideological creed . Do it this way , in the name of all that is holy and true in the academy . There is no room here for empathy , for student agency , or for faculty discretion .
Displaying empathy for the different experiences our students bring to the classroom is not a threat to our academic freedom . Allowing for a diversity of perspectives to flourish , even when that diversity might challenge the very structure of our course and its material , is not a threat , but an opportunity . Our first reaction to expressions of student agency , even when they seem misguided or perhaps frivolous , should not be to shut it down . If we really value academic freedom , then we need to model that with and for our students .
Ableism , misogyny , racism , elitism , and intellectual sloppiness deserve to be called out . That ’ s not a threat , that ’ s our students doing what they ’ re supposed to as engaged citizens of an academic community . This year , we should challenge ourselves to quit fixating on caricatures and hypotheticals and instead acknowledge the actual landscape of teaching and learning in all its messiness and complexity . When we act out of fear , we do harm . When we assume the worst from our students , that ’ s what we often end up getting — from them and from ourselves . We can do better than this .

free_speech,Reason,2,https://reason.com/2019/10/04/pornography-is-protected-by-the-first-amendment/,Pornography Is Protected by the First Amendment,2019-10-04,"Damon Root, Josh Blackman, Billy Binion, John Ross, C.J. Ciaramella, Scott Shackford, Nick Gillespie, Christian Britschgi, Eric Boehm, Jacob Sullum","The specter of pornography is once again haunting the minds of certain American conservatives . `` Let 's ban porn , '' Ross Douthat of The New York Times declared last year . Porn is `` just a product , '' he wrote , `` something made and distributed and sold , and therefore subject to regulation and restriction if we so desire . '' In The Daily Caller Zak Slayback recently doubled down on Douthat . `` Unlike a Scorsese film or a newspaper , both of which are consumed for artistic enjoyment , '' he wrote , `` pornography is consumed with one outside end in mind : orgasm and masturbation . Its primary purpose is not entertainment ( in any colloquial sense of the word ) or enlightenment . In that sense , pornography is just a tool , like any other product , and can be regulated like any other product . '' Slayback added : `` Do n't let the pornography lobby and libertarians frame this as a free speech issue . It 's is n't . ''
But of course this is a free speech issue , as the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized , even in cases in which the Court allowed certain restrictions on `` obscene '' material to stand .
For more than half a century , the Supreme Court has drawn a line between pornography , which enjoys the protections of the First Amendment , and obscenity , which does not . The distinction between the two shows why any sort of all-encompassing government ban on porn would run afoul of the Constitution .
In A Book Named `` John Cleland 's Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure '' v. Attorney General of Massachusetts ( 1966 ) , the Supreme Court considered a state effort to have a sexually explicit book declared obscene and therefore banned under state law . Not so fast , the justices told the Bay State . Even a `` patently offensive '' pornographic work , the Court held , is still protected by the First Amendment . `` A book can not be proscribed unless it is found to be utterly without redeeming social value . ''
Seven years later , the Court revised its obscenity test in a landmark ruling that continues to hold sway in all legal debates over porn and censorship . According to Miller v. California ( 1973 ) , `` state statutes designed to regulate obscene materials must be carefully limited . '' A state may only prohibit a work for being obscene if the work meets all of the following criteria :
( a ) whether `` the average person , applying contemporary community standards '' would find that the work , taken as a whole , appeals to the prurient interest… ( b ) whether the work depicts or describes , in a patently offensive way , sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law ; and ( c ) whether the work , taken as a whole , lacks serious literary , artistic , political , or scientific value .
The Court applied the Miller test a year later in Jenkins v. Georgia ( 1974 ) , a case which centered on the obscenity conviction of a movie theater manager who screened the film Carnal Knowledge , which featured nudity but would hardly qualify as pornographic by today 's standards . Writing for the majority , Justice William Rehnquist—nobody 's idea of a liberal squish—struck down the conviction .
Although the Georgia Supreme Court had upheld the theater manager 's obscenity bust on the grounds that `` the First Amendment does not protect the commercial exhibition of 'hard core ' pornography , '' as Rehnquist put it , he took a different view—literally . `` Our own viewing of the film , '' Rehnquist wrote , `` satisfies us that 'Carnal Knowledge ' could not be found under the Miller standards to depict sexual conduct in a patently offensive way .

Like it or not , the debate about porn is always a debate about free speech . The hands of every would-be government censor are still bound by the First Amendment .","The specter of pornography is once again haunting the minds of certain American conservatives. ""Let's ban porn,"" Ross Douthat of The New York Times declared last year. Porn is ""just a product,"" he wrote, ""something made and distributed and sold, and therefore subject to regulation and restriction if we so desire."" In The Daily Caller Zak Slayback recently doubled down on Douthat. ""Unlike a Scorsese film or a newspaper, both of which are consumed for artistic enjoyment,"" he wrote, ""pornography is consumed with one outside end in mind: orgasm and masturbation. Its primary purpose is not entertainment (in any colloquial sense of the word) or enlightenment. In that sense, pornography is just a tool, like any other product, and can be regulated like any other product."" Slayback added: ""Don't let the pornography lobby and libertarians frame this as a free speech issue. It's isn't.""

But of course this is a free speech issue, as the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized, even in cases in which the Court allowed certain restrictions on ""obscene"" material to stand.

For more than half a century, the Supreme Court has drawn a line between pornography, which enjoys the protections of the First Amendment, and obscenity, which does not. The distinction between the two shows why any sort of all-encompassing government ban on porn would run afoul of the Constitution.

In A Book Named ""John Cleland's Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure"" v. Attorney General of Massachusetts (1966), the Supreme Court considered a state effort to have a sexually explicit book declared obscene and therefore banned under state law. Not so fast, the justices told the Bay State. Even a ""patently offensive"" pornographic work, the Court held, is still protected by the First Amendment. ""A book cannot be proscribed unless it is found to be utterly without redeeming social value.""

Seven years later, the Court revised its obscenity test in a landmark ruling that continues to hold sway in all legal debates over porn and censorship. According to Miller v. California (1973), ""state statutes designed to regulate obscene materials must be carefully limited."" A state may only prohibit a work for being obscene if the work meets all of the following criteria:

(a) whether ""the average person, applying contemporary community standards"" would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest…(b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.

The Court applied the Miller test a year later in Jenkins v. Georgia (1974), a case which centered on the obscenity conviction of a movie theater manager who screened the film Carnal Knowledge, which featured nudity but would hardly qualify as pornographic by today's standards. Writing for the majority, Justice William Rehnquist—nobody's idea of a liberal squish—struck down the conviction.

Although the Georgia Supreme Court had upheld the theater manager's obscenity bust on the grounds that ""the First Amendment does not protect the commercial exhibition of 'hard core' pornography,"" as Rehnquist put it, he took a different view—literally. ""Our own viewing of the film,"" Rehnquist wrote, ""satisfies us that 'Carnal Knowledge' could not be found under the Miller standards to depict sexual conduct in a patently offensive way."" One can only imagine the sort of conversations that Rehnquist and his colleagues had in chambers that day.

As these cases illustrate, the question of whether sexually charged material rises to the level of potentially prohibitable obscenity turns in significant part on the specific contents of the work at issue. If the government wants to ban the sale or distribution of a particular dirty movie, in other words, the government must be able to convince the courts that the movie ""taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value."" Otherwise, it is protected by the First Amendment.

A one-size-fits-all government ban on pornography, by contrast, necessarily avoids all such case-by-case determinations and thus violates both the Supreme Court's precedents and the broader First Amendment principles they endorsed.

In the aftermath of the totalitarian horrors of the 20th century, freedom of speech was embraced by all of the countries that now make up the G-7. It was even enshrined in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. Unfortunately, freedom of speech has come under siege, especially in Europe, as governments seek to eradicate “hate” and “offensiveness” at the expense of the right of their own citizens to express themselves.

In the United Kingdom, the birthplace of freedom of speech, thousands of people have been arrested and prosecuted for social media posts, often at the behest of liberal activists. In France, which embraced freedom of speech later but with much more popular enthusiasm, people have for decades faced prosecution for “inciting hatred” through free speech.

Now, along with the German government led by Angela Merkel, President Macron is trying to create a system of mandatory censorship by imposing an affirmative duty on social media platforms to remove speech deemed hateful or offensive. Through the mechanism of the G-7, these very same governments sought to impose such a system on an international level.

President Trump, however, stayed true to the unshakable principles of the First Amendment, and his actions in France have positioned the United States as the last bastion of hope for liberal democracy. A lesser leader might have caved to pressures from the media and “woke” academic and cultural elites who share in the European goal of quashing free speech.

Americans should be grateful that President Trump rose to the occasion and ignored the hectoring. So long as he remains in the White House, the United States will stand as a resolute defender of core democratic values such as freedom of speech, even if our nation has to stand on its own.

In the face of critics bent on suppression , he tells it as he sees it
When Dave Chappelle ’ s Netflix special Sticks & Stones came out in August , the overwhelming response from critics was that it was offensive , unacceptable garbage .
Inkoo Kang of Slate declared that Chappelle ’ s “ jokes make you wince. ” Garrett Martin , in the online magazine Paste , maintained that the special was “ thoughtless ” and “ terrible ” — and that Chappelle was just “ acting like an a * * hole ” and proving that he was “ thoroughly out of touch with today. ” In The Atlantic , Hannah Giorgis called it a “ temper tantrum. ” Melanie McFarland ’ s piece in Salon disparaged it for its “ cruelty . ”
The “ professionals ” agreed — the special was trash , worthy of only a pathetic 33 percent critics ’ score on Rotten Tomatoes .
The low score really shouldn ’ t be surprising . After all , Chappelle was making jokes about untouchable subjects — such as race , the LGBT community , and school shootings . He literally said he didn ’ t believe Michael Jackson ’ s accusers , and hinted that it wouldn ’ t matter even if they were right , because , and I quote , “ it ’ s Michael Jackson ! ” In a climate where the phrase “ you guys ” has been deemed problematic , there is no way a comedian could actually expect to get away with things like that .
See , while the critics ’ response might make you think that the people who watched it were so traumatized that they haven ’ t come out from under their beds since , the Rotten Tomatoes audience score tells a different story : People liked it . They liked it a lot . In fact , the audience score was a whopping 99 percent .
How can this be ? Is this some kind of crazy outlier ? Although the super-woke critics , who no doubt fancy themselves to be the experts on art and culture , would have you think that it is , all actual evidence points to the fact that it ’ s not . In reality , the Problematic Police don ’ t represent the views of most of the country — no matter how much their shrill-shrieking tweets and buzzword-salad blog posts might be drowning out the more tempered views of Regular People .
The truth is , out in the Real World , humor that isn ’ t afraid to push boundaries has always been popular . South Park ( a show that has joked about subjects ranging from Mohammed to the Virgin Mary to Caitlyn Jenner to the death of Trayvon Martin ) was just renewed through a 26th season . At the end of September , It ’ s Always Sunny in Philadelphia will begin its 14th season , even though the last one featured comedic episodes on topics that the Woke Warriors would certainly say you may not joke about , such as the transgender-bathroom debate and Me Too .
There ’ s empirical evidence suggesting that the people who support extreme levels of political correctness are the ones who are , as Martin put it in his review of Chappelle ’ s special , “ out of touch with today ” — not the other way around . A study released last year by the international research initiative More in Common , titled “ Hidden Tribes : A Study of America ’ s Polarized Landscape , ” found that 80 percent of the population believes “ political correctness is a problem in our country , ” including 61 percent of traditional liberals . Like a beautiful but mean high-school bully after losing the Student Council election , the PC Police have learned they are not as popular as they thought they were .
How , then , did they get so powerful ? It ’ s simple : Cultural censorship through fear . The social-justice crowd has become the dominant voice on cultural affairs not because their views are actually the most popular , but because they are so good at silencing the others .
For many Americans , the prospect of being called “ racist , ” “ sexist , ” “ homophobic , ” or otherwise “ problematic ” has become more terrifying than death itself . People are afraid of being “ canceled ” ; the Thought Police know that . They don ’ t have to worry about finding silly things such as “ logic ” or “ facts ” to prop up their positions — they have a much easier route : your fear .
They ’ re very , very good at it , too . They ’ ve somehow made it accepted that if you are , for example , a man , you may not comment on any accusation of sexism — even if , say , someone makes the claim that the word “ too ” is “ sexist ” and hurts women . ( This actually happened a few years ago ; the Huffington Post published a 1,200-word piece on it . ) Similarly , if you are white , you can ’ t comment on any accusation of racism — even if , say , someone makes the claim that Lord of the Rings will have “ dire consequences . . . for society ” because the way it depicts the orcs will perpetuate racism . ( This , too , actually happened ; a sci-fi writer made that exact claim on the Geek ’ s Guide to the Galaxy podcast last year . ) Effectively , you are automatically silenced on a whole host of issues just because of your identity — logic be damned .
Is this any way for us to live ? Why is the majority staying silent for fear of a tiny subgroup whose only weapon is a handful of hack words ?
I understand the fear . I understand why a person might be afraid to speak freely , knowing that a spurious accusation of racism or sexism could easily result . I also understand why the easiest response to this sort of accusation would be to simply shut up or maybe apologize , regardless of whether you actually have anything to be sorry for . The PC mob rarely stops at calling someone “ offensive. ” No — it also wants anyone associated with anything it deems offensive to be cast out of the public square . It wants “ offensive ” people to be forbidden to speak on college campuses and even to be employed .
Yes , racism and sexism are very real , very serious issues . But the truth is , a culture that accepts an obsession with baselessly , randomly declaring “ racism ” and “ sexism ” where they don ’ t exist just minimizes the real instances of it . For example : I ’ ve experienced sexism countless times in my life . In fact , it ’ s pretty much impossible for me to look at my Twitter mentions without seeing someone telling me that I should stop my life and have kids immediately , or even that having kids is all that I ’ m good for because I am a woman . There are still people out there who do not see women as equal to men , and we should be talking about that and fighting for it to change . Unfortunately , however , the true examples of sexism can get lost when you have social-justice warriors screeching about how , say , the word “ manhole ” needs to be scrubbed out of city codes ( as the city of Berkeley , Calif. , announced it would do in July ) . Although the activists behind those sorts of movements might believe they ’ re helping women , the reality is that many people are going to hear that and think , “ Gee , if that ’ s all women have to complain about , this sexism thing must not be as bad as people say it is. ” The glaring irony is that the influence of social-justice militancy ends up actually hurting the very groups it purports to want to help .
Worse , that impact is only one of many negatives of cultural censorship . An obvious one is that it makes it difficult for us to have real , open conversations — which is the only way for us ever to truly understand each other and come up with the best solutions to our problems . Of course , we might not always agree — and there are always going to be people who actually think that , say , white women wearing hoop earrings amounts to “ cultural appropriation ” ( as a residence assistant at Pitzer College declared in a campus-wide email a couple of years ago ) , but evidence suggests that these people are not as common as they are loud . ( Yes : I have enough faith in humanity to claim that most people do not believe that any culture owns a shape , be it in earring form or otherwise . ) We need to stop allowing incompetent bullies to set the standard for what ’ s “ acceptable. ” We reasonable , well-adjusted folks are the silent majority — so it ’ s about damn time we stopped being so silent .
The PC obsession is also detrimental to comedy in particular . The problem with declaring certain tough or complicated subjects to be “ taboo ” or “ off-limits ” is that comedy is the only mechanism that ’ s capable of creating laughter or joy out of tough or complicated situations . I know this from experience : Comedy can heal like nothing else . For example , some people might say that jokes about death are “ inappropriate ” or “ not okay , ” but those sorts of jokes actually have helped me cope with my mother ’ s untimely , sudden death ( which happened a little less than five years ago ) more than anything else has . I even have a joke in my standup routine that mentions both her death and the death of a pet dog . I remember being terrified the first time I told it , because I was afraid I was “ making light ” of something that could be “ triggering , ” something that was too “ dark ” to joke about . I told it anyway , and have continued to do so , and I ’ m glad I have — because not only has it gotten laughs , but people who ’ ve heard it have told me that they ’ ve been through something similar and they related to what I had to say .
Of course , not all “ offensive ” jokes have this sort of impact ; some won ’ t do anything but make you cringe . And sure , I can even admit that some of the jokes in Chappelle ’ s special were more cringe-worthy than laugh-worthy . The thing is , though , that the only way for comedians to know if a joke is going to work or fail is by trying it — and we have to be careful to protect their license to try . If you think about it , calling for the “ cancellation ” of a comedian is quite like demanding that a baseball player be fired because he struck out . Making comedians too afraid to tell a joke , any joke , could result in our missing out on some great humor . And for what ? For the sake of not having to risk feeling uncomfortable for the brief time in our lives that we might choose to be at a comedy club , or watching a standup special on Netflix ? I don ’ t think anyone with even a moderate level of emotional competence would call that a fair trade .
Chappelle intended his special to be a protest against cancel culture and oversensitivity . As a comedian , he ’ s sick of it — and , as the audience response revealed , they — we ! — are too . Chappelle did his job ; now it ’ s time for us to do ours .

free_speech,Christian Science Monitor,1,https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2017/0928/The-shifting-politics-of-free-speech-in-America,The shifting politics of free speech in America,2017-09-28,Jessica Mendoza,"The First Amendment again drew national attention this week as two high-profile right-wing personalities appeared at prestigious universities on separate coasts to denounce what they say is an attack on free speech at college campuses across the country .
On Sunday , right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos addressed a crowd at the University of California , Berkeley ’ s historic Sproul Plaza . The 20-minute speech was a decidedly truncated version of the four-day “ Free Speech Week ” Mr. Yiannopoulos had been touting since his last scheduled appearance here was canceled in April . ( According to reports , the necessary permits and fees were not filed this time . ) Still , his presence drew dozens of counter-protesters who decried racism and white supremacy and whose shouts , Yiannopoulos later wrote on Facebook , “ made it impossible for any of our speakers to be heard . ”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions , at a talk on Tuesday at Georgetown University in Washington , told his audience , “ Protesters are now routinely shutting down speeches and debates across the country in an effort to silence voices that insufficiently conform with their views. ” As he spoke , about 100 students and faculty reportedly gathered outside the closed venue with signs reading , “ Deport hate ” and “ Free speech is not hate speech . ”
In choosing to speak about what they see as the growing limits on free expression , Mr . Sessions and Yiannopoulos continue to fortify a familiar right-wing refrain : that elite liberals and their insistence on political correctness are drowning out conservative voices , especially in the university setting .

On Sunday, right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos addressed a crowd at the University of California, Berkeley’s historic Sproul Plaza. The 20-minute speech was a decidedly truncated version of the four-day “Free Speech Week” Mr. Yiannopoulos had been touting since his last scheduled appearance here was canceled in April. (According to reports, the necessary permits and fees were not filed this time.) Still, his presence drew dozens of counter-protesters who decried racism and white supremacy and whose shouts, Yiannopoulos later wrote on Facebook, “made it impossible for any of our speakers to be heard.”

Attorney General Jeff Sessions, at a talk on Tuesday at Georgetown University in Washington, told his audience, “Protesters are now routinely shutting down speeches and debates across the country in an effort to silence voices that insufficiently conform with their views.” As he spoke, about 100 students and faculty reportedly gathered outside the closed venue with signs reading, “Deport hate” and “Free speech is not hate speech.”

In choosing to speak about what they see as the growing limits on free expression, Mr. Sessions and Yiannopoulos continue to fortify a familiar right-wing refrain: that elite liberals and their insistence on political correctness are drowning out conservative voices, especially in the university setting.

The narrative, political analysts note, reflects a significant if gradual shift in the conservative position on the First Amendment. For most of the past century, conservatives aligned themselves with restrictions around speech; it was liberals who traditionally championed expansions to protected expression. (Student activists from the New Left, for instance, led the 1964 Free Speech Movement in Berkeley.)

'Card-carrying member of the ACLU'

Traditional conservatism, with its concern for morality and family values, would seem to align with a speech-restrictive attitude. And since about the end of World War I, that view was in general reflected in conservative actions and thought. Robert Bork, who served as solicitor general under President Nixon and later a circuit court judge, wrote famously in 1971 that the First Amendment should be applied only to “explicitly political” speech. Between 1955 and 1964, 73 percent of free-speech articles in The National Review – a bedrock of conservative commentary – focused on limiting expression.

Association with aggressive free-speech advocacy – such as that embodied by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) – was, to conservatives, “a political attack of the first order,” Professor Batchis writes in his 2016 book, “The Right’s First Amendment: The Politics of Free Speech & the Return of Conservative Libertarianism.” In his 1988 presidential campaign, George H.W. Bush would regularly use the phrase “card-carrying member of the ACLU” to denounce Democrat Michael Dukakis.

Universities played a major role in the shift. Through the late 1960s onward liberals, especially in academia, sought to challenge what they saw as structural injustice by giving historically marginalized groups a voice long denied them. As it grew in momentum – and some say militancy – the leftist movement led to the evolution on the right of the term “politically correct,” which “reflected a perception that conservatives … were being muzzled,” Batchis writes.

Role of courts and universities

Many political analysts say there’s nothing inherently wrong with the two parties reversing their positions on the matter of free expression. “Particular constitutional rights can be favored or disfavored by the right or left respectively at different periods in political history – and the First Amendment is no exception,” Batchis writes.

The problem, they say, occurs when elements on both sides take their arguments too far.

On the left, that has manifested as the idea that offensive, hateful, and racist speech should not be spoken at all. “It’s not a bad impulse to think that because we have a diverse student body we need to be more sensitive to other points of view,” says Lata Nott, executive director of the First Amendment Center at the Newseum Institute in Washington.

Chapman,"( CNSNews.com ) -- A new report by the Media Research Center ( MRC ) documents how the major social media sites -- Facebook , Twitter , YouTube -- and the Google search engine suppress conservative speech in a `` clear effort to censor the conservative worldview from the public conversation . ''
When asked about this censorship by Sen. Ted Cruz ( R-Texas ) on April 10 , Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified that his company “ and the tech industry are located in Silicon Valley , which is an extremely left-leaning place , ” and added that he did not know whether content from liberal groups , such as Planned Parenthood and MoveOn.org , had ever been restricted on Facebook .
These multi-billion dollar online media companies , which reach more than 1.8 billion people worldwide , have declared war on the conservative movement , states the MRC report , and `` conservatives are losing -- badly . '' If `` the right does n't fight , '' states the report , `` it is doomed -- online and off . This is more than just a free speech battle .

In the detailed , 50-page report , CENSORED ! How Online Media Companies Are Suppressing Conservative Speech , authors Ashley Rae Goldenberg and Dan Gainor examine how Facebook , Twitter , YouTube , and Google suppress conservative content online , provide numerous examples of the suppression ( and censorship ) , and then provide recommendations for the tech companies .
Twitter `` leads in censorship , '' according to the report . It `` regularly suppresses conservative points-of-view . ''
The $ 21.60 billion company manages about 6,000 tweets every second from people all over the world , and it is the go-to site for journalists . Twitter 's CEO is Jack Dorsey . He is extremely left-wing politically and he recently promoted an article from Medium to his 4.2 million Twitter followers that said America is in a `` new civil war , '' liberal vs. conservative , and there is no compromise , only one side must win .
The CENSORED ! report documents how Twitter staffers admitted on hidden camera that they censor conservatives through `` shadow banning .

Marsha Blackburn ( R-Tenn. ) , but allows Planned Parenthood advertisements . ''
Twitter hid some conservative-related hashtags during the 2016 election , such as # PodestaEmails and # DNCLeak , said the MRC . Twitter has also marked some tweets from the Drudge Report as `` sensitive . ''
Twitter uses a `` Trust and Safety Council '' to provide policy input to the company . This council is comprised of 25 U.S.-based organizations , 12 of which are liberal and only one of which is conservative , according to the report . `` [ S ] ome of its most liberal members include the Anti-Defamation League , GLAAD , and other organizations that have attacked conservatives and their opinions or values , '' said authors Goldenberg and Gainor .
“ Voices are being silenced , opinions are being censored and conservative media are being suppressed , '' said MRC President Brent Bozell in a statement . `` These tech companies claim they provide platforms to connect people and share ideas . However , when the only ideas permitted are from one side , any prospect of intellectual discourse dies . ''
`` If these platforms merely serve as an echo chamber of liberal talking points , everyone loses , '' he said . `` Our country is divided and limiting free speech only makes matters worse . ''
Facebook has 1.4 billion daily users and has a corporate worth of $ 477.93 billion . It is the third most popular social media site in the United States and in the world .

Facebook employees `` donated overwhelmingly to support Hillary Clinton 's presidential campaign over Donald Trump 's , '' reads the report . `` Facebook employees even lobbied to remove Trump 's posts for violating the site 's 'hate speech ' standards . ''
According to the report. , former Facebook employees told Gizmodo that `` topics such as the Conservative Political Action Conference , Mitt Romney and Ted Cruz were reportedly suppressed , along with links to sites including the Washington Examiner and Breitbart . '' The company also banned the private sale of guns on its site and reportedly has sought to `` censor discussion of firearms . '' Former employees also stated that Facebook hid conservative content from its `` trending '' section .
Facebook removed a comical post by conservative Todd Starnes and only later restored it , apologizing for the alleged error .
Facebook , along with Twitter , YouTube , and Google , utilizes the work of the left-wing Southern Poverty Law Center ( SPLC ) to identify `` hate '' groups and then suppress or remove them from its platform . According to the report , `` Over time , Facebook deleted the pages of at least 57 groups at the behest of the SPLC . ''
The SPLC frequently targets conservative and Christian individuals or groups because they oppose , for instance , gay marriage or radical Islam . The Family Research Council , for instance , has been labeled a `` hate '' group by the SPLC because it defends the Biblical definition of marriage as being between one man and one woman .
Testifying before the Senate on April 10 , Zuckerberg was asked by Sen. Ben Sasse ( R-Neb . ) to explain his company ’ s definition of “ hate speech , ” which Facebook uses to monitor and suppress certain content . Zuckerberg did not answer the question directly but said it was a “ really hard question ” and that “ we struggle with it . ”
YouTube , the most popular video-sharing platform in the world , `` censors conservatives and conservative content , '' according to the report . YouTube apparently is always on the watch for `` hate speech '' and relies on the anti-conservative SPLC as a `` Trusted Flagger '' to tag videos that violate content standards . YouTube moderators , for instance , took down conservative gun channels , reported Bloomberg , and the site has banned `` videos that provide links to sites where people can purchase guns and gun accessories , '' said the MRC 's Goldenberg and Gainor .
PragerU , which posts myriad videos on conservative topics , saw its videos restricted by YouTube . PragerU is now suing YouTube .

In YouTube is a $ 75 billion company and it is owned by Google , which has a corporate worth of $ 715.65 billion .
The Google website , with its popular search engine , is ranked as the No . 1 website in the world . Millions of people use its search engine every day . They may assume that the search engine is non-partisan , says the MRC report , but `` Google has suppressed conservative points-of-view within the company and in its own search results . ''
For instance , three separate studies have confirmed that search engine results on Google `` favored liberal sites or liberal candidates during the 2016 presidential election , '' said the report . For awhile ( since discontinued ) , Google `` posted fact-checks of conservative sites but not their liberal counterparts , '' according to the MRC report , `` making the conservative sites appear less reliable .

Numerous other examples of Facebook , Twitter , YouTube , and Google suppressing ( and censoring ) content posted by conservatives are detailed in 35 pages of appendices in the CENSORED ! report .
In its recommendations for these tech firms , the report calls on the companies to be truly diverse in their hiring and bring in conservatives and also `` eliminate policies and biases that discriminate against conservatives . '' The companies also need to provide transparency when it comes to restrictions on content -- let people see what was removed and why . The companies should stop partnering with anti-conservative groups , such as the SPLC and ADL because they are not neutral . In addition , the tech giants need to steer clear of left-leaning `` fact checkers '' such as Snopes.com and PolitiFact.com .
At the same time , the tech firms need to publish clear guidelines in support of free speech online . `` Algorithms , content guidelines and ad policies must be designed that do n't target political speech , '' reads the report . `` Firms must stop pretending disagreement is equivalent to hate speech . Fairness and transparency are equally essential . ''
“ Facebook , Twitter and the rest of the social media giants must allow political expression from both conservative and liberal voices , '' said the MRC 's Bozell . `` Just last week , Mark Zuckerberg told Congress that he is working to ensure Facebook is ' a platform for all ideas . ' This report is evidence that what little effort they have made is not nearly enough . ''
`` Facebook , Twitter , Google and YouTube must make real , concrete changes to guarantee conservative voices receive a fair shake , '' he said . `` We can not allow our thoughts and ideas to be barred from the global public conversation . ”

The companies also need to provide transparency when it comes to restrictions on content -- let people see what was removed and why. The companies should stop partnering with anti-conservative groups, such as the SPLC and ADL because they are not neutral. In addition, the tech giants need to steer clear of left-leaning ""fact checkers"" such as Snopes.com and PolitiFact.com.

At the same time, the tech firms need to publish clear guidelines in support of free speech online. ""Algorithms, content guidelines and ad policies must be designed that don't target political speech,"" reads the report. ""Firms must stop pretending disagreement is equivalent to hate speech. Fairness and transparency are equally essential.""

“Facebook, Twitter and the rest of the social media giants must allow political expression from both conservative and liberal voices,"" said the MRC's Bozell. ""Just last week, Mark Zuckerberg told Congress that he is working to ensure Facebook is 'a platform for all ideas.' This report is evidence that what little effort they have made is not nearly enough.""

""Facebook, Twitter, Google and YouTube must make real, concrete changes to guarantee conservative voices receive a fair shake,"" he said. ""We cannot allow our thoughts and ideas to be barred from the global public conversation.”

Ashley Rae Goldenberg was the project lead for the report. Dan Gainor is the vice president of Business and Culture at the MRC. To learn more about the report, click here.
