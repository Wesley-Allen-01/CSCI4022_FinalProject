Miller,"President Trump signed a memorandum Friday to delay — and potentially cancel — a sweeping federal rule that would impose new responsibilities on financial advisers , a move guaranteed to provoke heated objections from consumer advocates and liberal lawmakers .
The memorandum targets the Department of Labor ’ s fiduciary rule that , when it begins to phase in April 10 , would elevate all financial professionals dealing with retirement plans to the level of fiduciary , with increased ethics and legal duties that could effect the retirement accounts they offered and their relationship with clients .
The Trump administration , siding with the financial services industry , said the rule will force advisers to limit the investment choices offered to clients .
“ We think this was a complete miss on what they were trying to do . It has completely unintended consequences , ” a senior White House official said . “ It took away a huge amount of investment options . ”
Supporters of the fiduciary rule argue that it protects consumers by requiring commission-based brokers and insurance agents to disclose conflicts of interest and forcing them to recommend the lowest cost 401 ( k ) plans , individual retirement accounts or other retirement savings plans .
The rule would affect more than $ 3 trillion of retirement assets in the U.S .
Former President Barack Obama ’ s administration estimated it would protect consumers who lose an estimated $ 17 billion a year from retirement investments due to advisor conflicts of interest .
The Trump memorandum directs the labor secretary to delay implementation of the rule , review it and propose further action .
“ They might determine that it is completely unnecessary , ” the official said .
Mr. Trump also is expected to sign an executive order for a re-examination of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act and its Volcker Rule that restricts banks from making certain speculative investments .
The order directs the treasury secretary to consult with regulatory agencies about possible changes to the laws and to report back to the president with recommendations , according to the White House
The White House official described the Dodd-Frank law as a “ massive overreach ” that imposed burdensome red tape on banks while failing to address the worst problems related to the 2007 financial crisis . Those unaddressed problems included too-big-to-fail banks , taxpayer bailouts and government-sponsored enterprise ( GSE ) such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the official said .
It would take an act of Congress to repeal or significantly alter Dodd-Frank . The administration instead is looking for ways to loosen or tweak the regulatory requirements .
“ This is not an attempt to undo Dodd-Frank , ” the official said . “ There are quite a few things we can do on Dodd-Frank and Volcker Rule that we think will have a significant impact . ”","President Trump signed a memorandum Friday to delay — and potentially cancel — a sweeping federal rule that would impose new responsibilities on financial advisers, a move guaranteed to provoke heated objections from consumer advocates and liberal lawmakers.

In doing so , prosecutors are confronting the popular belief that Wall Street institutions have grown so important to the economy that they can not be charged . A lack of criminal prosecutions of banks and their leaders fueled a public outcry over the perception that Wall Street giants are “ too big to jail . ”
Addressing those concerns , prosecutors in Washington and New York have met with regulators about how to criminally punish banks without putting them out of business and damaging the economy , interviews with lawyers and records reviewed by The New York Times show .
The new strategy underpins the decision to seek guilty pleas in two of the most advanced investigations : one into Credit Suisse for offering tax shelters to Americans , and the other against France ’ s largest bank , BNP Paribas , over doing business with countries like Sudan that the United States has blacklisted . The approach applies to American banks , though those investigations are at an earlier stage .
In the talks with BNP , which has a huge investment bank in New York , prosecutors in Manhattan and Washington have outlined plans to extract a criminal guilty plea from the bank ’ s parent company , according to the lawyers , who were not authorized to speak publicly . If BNP is unable to negotiate a lesser punishment — the bank has enlisted the support of high-ranking French officials to pressure prosecutors — the case could counter congressional criticism that arose after the British bank HSBC escaped similar charges two years ago .
Such criminal cases hinge on the cooperation of regulators , some who warned that charging HSBC could have prompted the revocation of the bank ’ s charter , the corporate equivalent of the death penalty . Federal guidelines require prosecutors to weigh the broader economic consequences of charging corporations .

The prosecutors who attended the meeting and are leading the investigation — Preet Bharara , the United States attorney in Manhattan ; David O ’ Neil , the head of the Justice Department ’ s criminal division in Washington ; and Cyrus Vance Jr. , the Manhattan district attorney — left largely reassured .
During the meeting at the New York Fed ’ s headquarters in Lower Manhattan , the lawyers said , Mr. Lawsky said he planned to impose steep penalties against BNP and its employees but would not revoke the bank ’ s license . The prosecutors secured similar assurances from the New York Fed , the lawyers said , though the Fed ’ s board in Washington must still approve the decision about BNP , which has not been accused of any wrongdoing .
Depending on the regulator — American and European banks are divided among a patchwork of agencies in New York and Washington — the path to filing charges could still be difficult . While regulators might be philosophically aligned with prosecutors , some feel bound by rules that govern their response to criminal charges . At a meeting last September , a top federal regulator vowed not to interfere if Mr. Bharara obtained a guilty plea from JPMorgan Chase over its ties to Bernard L. Madoff , according to the lawyers and records of the meeting . But the regulator , Thomas J. Curry , a frequent critic of Wall Street , warned that federal law might require him to reconsider JPMorgan ’ s charter if the bank was convicted of a crime .
The discussions with regulators , recounted in interviews with the lawyers and in records obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request , offer a lens into the political and legal minefields that prosecutors navigate when investigating big banks . The interviews also demonstrate that defense lawyers continue to push prosecutors not to act without assurances that regulators will keep a bank in business .
In a recent speech to Wall Street lawyers , Mr. Bharara said this dynamic created a “ gaping liability loophole that blameworthy companies are only too willing to exploit . ”
He noted that regulators often possessed many of the same facts , including emails and documents , that underpin a criminal case . The prosecutors and regulators , he said , need to “ work in concert . ”

The bank , which would be the biggest financial institution to plead guilty since Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1989 , hopes that prosecutors will settle for a guilty plea from a BNP subsidiary .
The investigation into BNP has centered on whether the bank processed transactions for countries — including Sudan and Iran — that the United States government has placed under sanctions . The bank , which conducted its own internal investigation that “ identified a significant volume of transactions that could be considered impermissible ” between 2002 and 2009 , may have improperly routed some money through its New York branches . Prosecutors decided that the conduct warranted more than a deferred-prosecution agreement . But leery of spurring a run on the bank , the prosecutors turned to regulators for assurances — which were largely provided at the April 18 meeting at the New York Fed .
Still , to be meaningful , a guilty plea would require some consequences . Mr. Lawsky told prosecutors that he would consider temporarily suspending the bank ’ s ability to transfer money through New York branches on behalf of foreign clients , a move that could undercut the bank ’ s revenue .
A spokesman for Mr. Lawsky declined to comment , as did the spokesmen for Mr. Bharara , Mr. Curry and Mr. O ’ Neil . The Fed and Mr. Vance ’ s office also declined to comment .
In other cases , Mr. Bharara reached an impasse with regulators .
He first met with Mr. Curry , the Comptroller of the Currency , in September 2012 to discuss the potential fallout from criminal charges , records show . A year later , as Mr. Bharara ’ s investigation into JPMorgan ’ s business with Mr. Madoff was heating up , he made another visit to the regulator .
Joined by his top lieutenants — Lorin L. Reisner , Joon Kim and Richard B. Zabel — Mr. Bharara sought to clarify the potential repercussions of a JPMorgan guilty plea , according to the meeting records . Mr. Curry , flanked by his own top aides , Paul Nash and Daniel Stipano , was sympathetic to the dilemma .
But Mr. Curry stopped short of promising that JPMorgan ’ s charter would be safe . He pointed to a federal law that requires the Comptroller ’ s office to hold a hearing about potentially terminating “ all rights , privileges and franchises of the bank. ” Ultimately , JPMorgan received a roughly $ 2 billion penalty from Mr. Curry and Mr. Bharara , but did not have to plead guilty .
Moving forward , Mr. Bharara is exploring ways around the automatic hearing , which applies only to money laundering convictions . Other charges , including wire fraud , do not automatically require a hearing .
“ The revocation of a charter amounts to a death sentence for a bank , ” said Daniel Levy , a former prosecutor in Mr. Bharara ’ s office , who is now a principal at McKool Smith . “ Any rational prosecutor would want to know the consequences of a charge , if possible in advance . ”","Photo

He first met with Mr. Curry, the Comptroller of the Currency, in September 2012 to discuss the potential fallout from criminal charges, records show. A year later, as Mr. Bharara’s investigation into JPMorgan’s business with Mr. Madoff was heating up, he made another visit to the regulator.

Joined by his top lieutenants — Lorin L. Reisner, Joon Kim and Richard B. Zabel — Mr. Bharara sought to clarify the potential repercussions of a JPMorgan guilty plea, according to the meeting records. Mr. Curry, flanked by his own top aides, Paul Nash and Daniel Stipano, was sympathetic to the dilemma.

But Mr. Curry stopped short of promising that JPMorgan’s charter would be safe. He pointed to a federal law that requires the Comptroller’s office to hold a hearing about potentially terminating “all rights, privileges and franchises of the bank.” Ultimately, JPMorgan received a roughly $2 billion penalty from Mr. Curry and Mr. Bharara, but did not have to plead guilty.

Moving forward, Mr. Bharara is exploring ways around the automatic hearing, which applies only to money laundering convictions. Other charges, including wire fraud, do not automatically require a hearing.

“The revocation of a charter amounts to a death sentence for a bank,” said Daniel Levy, a former prosecutor in Mr. Bharara’s office, who is now a principal at McKool Smith. “Any rational prosecutor would want to know the consequences of a charge, if possible in advance.”",www.dealbook.nytimes.com,left,Mekjss5s2zx3hFeL

The market storm that has engulfed Wall Street to start 2016 again took aim at stock investors, with the Dow closing down nearly 400 points Friday, as increasingly jittery traders reacted to the latest swoon in oil prices and another big selloff in Chinese stocks.

The massive selloff extended the U.S. stock market's worst start to a year ever to 10 trading sessions. The slide is gaining steam amid raising investor fears of slowing global growth and even steeper losses in markets.

""Today hasn't been an easy one in the markets for the faint of heart,"" Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist for U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said.

At the closing bell, the Dow Jones industrial average, which at one point was down nearly 537 points, was off 391 points, or 2.4%, to 15,988.08, and back to levels last seen in August.

The Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 2.2% to 1880.20, after earlier falling below its August low of 1867.61, a key level Wall Street is watching and hopes will hold as it marked the bottom on the last correction. The Nasdaq composite index stumbled 2.7%. The S&P 500 is now down 8% in 2016 and the Nasdaq is off 10.4%.

The Dow:

► Finished the week down 2.2%

► Is down 8.25% for 2016

► Is 12.69% off its all-time high of May 2015

In a replay of other big down days so far in the new year, Thursday's rebound on Wall Street turned out to be short-lived and heavy selling resumed Friday.

Advice for investors during crazy stock market volatility

Market crash robs $2.3 trillion from investors

The latest sell-off is a sign that many investors, spooked by the ongoing bloodletting on Wall Street, are throwing in the towel and reducing their positions in stocks to pare risk.

""It does feel a bit like capitulation before a near-term bottom right now,"" Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, told USA TODAY.

The fact that Wall Street is closed Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day, was also cited as a reason for the heavy selling, as investors did not want to hold stocks over the long weekend, some Wall Street pros say.

A top Wall Street executive warned that stocks could slide another 10% before ending the year up higher.

BlackRock CEO and Chairman Laurence Fink in a Friday appearance on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" characterized the current financial conditions as ""a real market decline, bordering on a bear market.""

The Shanghai composite index sank 3.55% to finish at 2,900.97, its lowest close since Dec. 8, 2014, as renewed concerns about China's economy led global stocks lower.

The Shanghai composite index has dropped more than 20% from its high in December, officially entering bear market territory.

China’s official Xinhua News Agency reported that banks’ new yuan loans during the last month fell over a year earlier, in a sign that momentum for the credit that fuels economic growth was slowing.

Japan’s Nikkei 225 index lost 0.5% to close at 17,147.11 while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index dropped 1.5% to 19,520.77.

European shares were lower Friday. Germany's DAX lost 2.5%, France's CAC 40 was 2.4% lower and Britain's FTSE 100 was down 1.9%.

President Donald Trump is signaling that he 's considering loosening coronavirus social distancing guidelines amid the growing economic fallout , while public health officials warn that approach could quickly overload hospital systems and cost more lives .

Senate leaders and White House reach deal on a huge relief package amid increasingly bitter negotiations
Tuesday is the ninth day of the president 's 15-day guidelines to slow the spread

After a little under 15 hours of closed-door , bipartisan talks , White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland announced to reporters at about 1 a.m. local time that negotiators have a deal on the $ 2 trillion economic stimulus package .
They are still drafting some of this deal , but negotiators say they have an agreement .
`` Ladies and gentlemen , we are done . We have a deal , '' Ueland said . `` Much of the work on the bill text has been completed and I ’ m hopeful over the next few hours [ it will be finished ] … We will circulate it early in the morning . ”
Ueland said they “ have either clear , explicit legislative text reflecting all parties , or we know exactly where we ’ re going to land without a legislative text , as we continue to finish . ”
Sens . Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer were expected on the Senate floor overnight .
Trump says any decision to relax guidelines will be based on 'hard facts and data '
At the later afternoon White House briefing , President Trump continued to lay the groundwork for rolling back social distancing guidelines as he opened the daily coronavirus task force briefing and pointed to Easter as the end of the `` historic battle '' against COVID-19 .
`` Ultimately , the goal is to ease the guidelines and open things up to very large sections of our country as we near the end of our historic battle with the invisible enemy . It will go on for a while but we will win , '' Trump said . `` Easter is our timeline , what a great timeline that would be . ''
As Dr. Anthony Fauci stood behind him , Trump said any decision on `` opening up '' the country would be `` based on hard facts and data . ''
President Donald Trump speaks with Vice President Mike Pence and Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Anthony Fauci behind him during the coronavirus task force daily briefing at the White House in Washington , March 24 , 2020 . Jonathan Ernst/Reuters
`` Our decision will be based on hard facts and data , and I 'm also hopeful to have Americans working -- again , by that beautiful Easter day . Rest assured every decision we make is grounded solely in the health , safety and well-being of our citizens , '' he said .
The president said the administration is `` working very hard to make that a reality '' an that `` we will be meeting with a lot of people to see if it can be done '' although it was n't clear who , besides public health experts , would be advising him .
Dr. Deborah Birx said she and Fauci remain `` concerned '' about New York City and the New York metro area and said anyone who was in the region the last few days should self-quarantine for the next 14 days , based on the time they left New York .
Dr. Deborah Birx , White House coronavirus response coordinator , speaks about the coronavirus in the James Brady Briefing Room , Tuesday , March 24 , 2020 , in Washington . Alex Brandon/AP
`` About 56 % of all the cases in the United States are coming out of that metro area and 50 % of all the new cases are coming out of the metro New York area , and 31 % of the people succumbing to this disease , '' Birx said . `` It means , because they are still at the 31 % mortality compared to the other regions of the country , that we could have a huge impact if we unite together . ''
She continued that it `` will be very critical that those individuals do self quarantine in their homes over the next 14 days to make sure they do n't pass the virus to others based on the time they left New York , '' she said
Fauci emphasized the same concerns , saying they 're now seeing people spread the disease from New York to other parts of the country .
`` It 's a very serious situation and that suffered terribly through no fault of their own but what we are seeing now is understandably people want to get out of New York , '' Fauci said . `` The idea of self isolating for two weeks will be very important . ''
As reporters started asking questions , Trump was asked if Easter was a realistic timeline for ending social distancing measures . `` I would love to see it come even sooner , but I think that would be a beautiful timeline , '' Trump said .
When Fauci was asked a similar question , if 19 days from now is a realistic timeline , Fauci said it was a `` flexible situation '' and pointed to the importance of studying areas of the country where the outbreak is n't obvious .
`` That 's very flexible . We just had a conversation with the president in the Oval Office talking about -- you can look at a date but you have to be very flexible on it , on a literal day-to-day basis , Fauci said .
Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , speaks about the coronavirus in the James Brady Briefing Room , Tuesday , March 24 , 2020 , in Washington . Alex Brandon/AP
`` It 's going to be looking at the data . What we do n't have right now that we really do need is we need to know what 's going on in those areas of the country , where there is n't an obvious outbreak . Is there something underneath the surface that says , wait a minute , you better be careful and clamp down ? Or , are there things there that say you do n't have to be as harsh as you are in other areas ? '' he said .
`` When you look at the country , obviously no one is going to want to tone down things when you see what 's going on in a place like New York City . I mean , that 's just good public health practice and common sense , '' Fauci said .
Trump : Would 'love to have the country opened up by Easter '
President Trump kept up his push to have America `` open for business very soon '' on a Fox News `` virtual town hall '' Tuesday afternoon from the White House Rose Garden .
He said he would `` love to have the country opened up by Easter '' which is April 12 .

`` It 's such an important day for other reasons , but I will make it an important day for this : I would love to have the country opened up , and they are just raring to go , by Easter . ''
`` We lose thousands of people a year to the flu . We never turn the country off , '' Trump said , echoing what he said at his Monday night White House briefing . `` We lose much more than that to automobile accidents . We did n't call up the automobile companies and say , ‘ Stop making cars . We do n't want any cars anymore. ’ We have to get back to work . ''
The president issued full-throated support for people going back to work , though he said people would have to be smart about it .
`` We have to go back to work much sooner than people thought , '' Trump said , amid reports the White House is considering a gradual scaling back of social distancing guidelines based on age and location .
`` We can socially distance ourselves and go to work , and you have to work a little bit harder . And you can clean your hands five times more than you used to . You do n't have to shake hands anymore , with people . That might be something good coming out of this , '' Trump said .
`` I think it ’ s possible . Why isn ’ t it ? We ’ ve never closed the country before and we ’ ve had some pretty bad flus , '' Trump said . `` We have to get our country back to work ... In my opinion , more people are going to die if we allow this to continue . ''
`` Look , you 're going to lose a number of people to the flu . But you 're going to lose more people by putting a country into a massive recession or depression . You 're going to lose people . You 're going to have suicides by the thousands . You 're going to have all sorts of things happen , '' he said . `` You 're going to have instability . You ca n't just come in and say , 'Let 's close up the United States of America , the biggest -- the most successful country in the world by far . '
Easter is less than three weeks away meaning Trump would `` reopen '' the country right about the time New York is expected to hit its peak level of cases .
Amid fallout from public health officials that testing in the U.S. has lagged behind other countries , Trump emphasized a comment by Dr. Deborah Birx that the U.S. has now conducted more tests than South Korea .
`` In a short period of time we ’ ve done more testing than South Korea , '' the president said , turning to Birx . `` I 'd love you to say that one more time . That 's a big number . We 've done more than South Korea -- in a short period of time . We are doing more than South Korea by a lot . ''
Birx said that while the U.S. has completed over 300,000 tests , `` We have more to do . ''
`` Is everything cool with you and Dr . Fauci ? '' Trump was asked . Dr. Anthony Fauci , the nation 's top infectious disease expert and a key member of the coronavirus task force , has candidly contradicted the president on certain overstatements in recent days , including the president 's optimism over drugs for coronavirus treatment despite no drugs currently being approved to treat it .
`` He has other things to do . We get along very well ... we 're fine , we 're fine , '' Trump said , complimenting the team of doctors on the coronavirus task force as `` extraordinary . ''
`` If we delay this out , you are going to lose more people than you are losing with the situation as we know it , '' Trump said . `` I think it 's very important for our country to go back . I 've had many , many people -- when he said 'it 's a little bit controversial ' -- not to most people . Most people said I 'm right about it . ''
Hours after New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo , a Democrat , blasted the federal response , but not Trump by name -- saying FEMA sending 400 ventilators did n't cut it when New York needed tens of thousands -- Trump signaled the lack of ventilators was actually Cuomo 's fault .
Prepared to respond to Cuomo 's harsh criticism , Trump was handed a piece of paper from someone off camera and read it off :
`` This says New York Governor Cuomo rejected buying 16,000 ventilators in 2015 , '' Trump said . `` So he had a chance to buy in 2015 , 16,000 ventilators at a very low price , and he turned it down . I 'm not blaming him or anything else . But he should n't be talking about us . He 's supposed to be buying his own ventilators . ''
Later on , Trump said that the federal government 's relationship with governors is a `` two-way street , '' adding , `` Then I hear that there 's a problem with ventilators . Well we sent them ventilators . And they could have had 15 or 16,000 two years ago and all they had to do was order them . They ca n't blame us for that . ''
Asked by Fox News ’ Bill Hemmer in a one-on-one interview taped after an earlier town hall why he chose Easter as the date by which he wanted the country “ opened up , ” Trump said one reason is because it would be “ beautiful ” to have the churches full .
“ Easter ’ s a very special day for me . And I see it ’ s sort of in that timeline that I ’ m thinking about . And I say , wouldn ’ t it be great to have all of the churches full ? ” Trump said . “ I think Easter Sunday -- and you ’ ll have packed churches all over our country -- I think it would be a beautiful time . ”
“ And it ’ s just about the timeline that I think is right , ” the president continued . “ It gives us more of a chance to work on what we ’ re doing . And I ’ m not sure that ’ s going to be the day , but I would like to aim it right at Easter Sunday . ”

Moments ahead of Trump ’ s town hall , New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo , in a fiery daily news conference on COVID-19 , blasted the federal government ’ s response to the outbreak , saying that it holds the power to produce life-saving ventilators and other equipment but is n't invoking it -- at the cost of human lives .
`` FEMA says , 'we 're sending 400 ventilators . ' Really ? What am I going to do with 400 ventilators when I need 30,000 ? '' Cuomo said . `` You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators . ''
`` The only way we can obtain these ventilators is from the federal government , period , '' Cuomo continued , criticizing the Trump administration ’ s delay in using the powers of the Defense Production Act . `` I need the ventilators in 14 days . Only the federal government has that power . And not to exercise that power is inexplicable to me . ''
`` The president said 'it 's a war , it 's a war . ' Then act like it 's a war , '' Cuomo added .
Vice President Mike Pence , appearing on a Fox News 'virtual town hall '' from the White House Rose Garden after Cuomo 's complaints , said , `` I know we started our conversation this hour on the subject ventilators and the challenges the state of New York faces . I was so pleased to confirm that earlier today that FEMA , from the national stockpile , shipped 2,000 ventilators to the state of New York -- and tomorrow there will be another 2,000 ventilators shipped from the national stockpile . ''
President Trump doubled down on comments made Monday that Americans `` can not let the cure be worse than the problem itself '' referencing economic fallout amid social distancing guidelines designed to minimize fatalities due to COVID-19 .
`` Our people want to return to work , '' the president tweeted Tuesday morning . `` They will practice Social Distancing and all else , and Seniors will be watched over protectively & lovingly . We can do two things together . THE CURE CAN NOT BE WORSE ( by far ) THAN THE PROBLEM ! Congress MUST ACT NOW . We will come back strong ! ''
At Monday night 's briefing , ███ Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl asked the president if he 's worried about the virus spreading unabated if the restrictions are lifted .
`` We have two very , very powerful alternatives that we have to take into consideration , '' Trump said . `` Life is fragile and economies are fragile . ''
`` If it were up to the doctors , they may say , 'Let 's keep it shut down . Let 's shut down the entire world because again you 're up to 150 countries , ' '' Trump said , when asked whether any doctors on the task force agreed with his suggestion that social distancing guidelines will pay off in weeks not months .
`` So , let 's shut down the entire world and when we shut it down , that 'd be wonderful , and let 's keep it shut for a couple of years . We ca n't do that , '' Trump said .
The president also predicted `` there will be tremendous death '' from shutting down the economy and job losses , `` probably '' more than the disease would cause .
He 's expected to expand on the topic in a town hall with Fox News Monday afternoon -- in an event appearing to replace , for now at least , the daily coronavirus task force briefing .
State of the stimulus package : Negotiations continue , leaders signal Tuesday night vote
After Senate Democrats successfully blocked the GOP-backed `` phase three '' $ 2 trillion coronavirus relief measure in its current form twice in 24 hours , negotiations between Senate leadership and the White House continue behind closed doors ,

Patrick Semansky/AP
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell expressed hope that the Senate would successfully vote to move forward on the stimulus bill from the floor Tuesday morning and again slammed his Democratic colleagues for the unforeseen delays .
`` The clock has run out , the buzzer is sounded , the hour for bargaining as though this were business as usual has expired , '' McConnell said .
A little after midnight , Secretary Treasury Steve Mnuchin and director of White House Legislative Affairs Eric Ueland emerged from their final meeting with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and his top staff .
All parties said there were a few remaining issues to lock down but that they were nearly done -- and expect a deal .
`` There 's still a few little differences , '' Schumer said . `` Neither of us think they ’ re in any way going to get in the way of a final agreement . ''
The Democratic leader said the Senate would `` hopefully vote on it '' Tuesday evening .
Trump said in Monday 's night briefing that Republicans and Democrats `` have no choice '' but to reach a deal .
`` I got a call a little while ago . I guess they 're getting closer . Should go quickly and must go quickly , '' Trump said . `` It 's not really a choice . Do n't have a choice . They have to make a deal . ''
If and when the Senate bill passes , it will then go to the House for a vote .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unveiled her own massive economic stimulus proposal , the Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act , Monday afternoon on Capitol Hill , in case the Senate bill fails .
`` I think there is opportunity -- real optimism that we could get something done the next few hours , '' Pelosi said , complimenting Senate Democrats for their efforts to make the bill less for corporate America and more beneficial to workers .
`` If we do n't have unanimous consent , my two options with my members is to call them back to vote to amend this bill , or to pass our own bill and go to conference with that , '' she added .
The president ’ s top economic adviser Larry Kudlow expressed hope that at the end of the 15-day period , the administration can reassess and -- with the sign-off health officials -- target certain areas in the country where there ’ s a low occurrence of coronavirus spread to resume more normal economic functions .

`` We will take another look at the possibility of targeting areas that are safe enough . We have to do this with the assent and help of the health specialists . No question about that . It 's just a matter of where it 's possible to open places that are not hot zones , for example , in order to try to expand the business reach and reduce the shut-in that 's taken over the economy , '' Kudlow said on FOX Business .
He further expanded on the idea of targeting specific zones speaking with reporters , emphasizing that the president ’ s economic advisers aren ’ t advising an `` either/or scenario '' but arguing that `` public health includes economic health . ''
`` If we can target zones where viruses is less prevalent , think it ’ s safe , '' Kudlow said . `` We 're not abandoning the health professionals advice but there is a clamor to try to reopen the economy and , perhaps , cause less of a shut in . ''
I asked Kudlow specifically about the idea of letting younger people who are not in high-risk groups return to work sooner .
`` I do n't want to be specific , that 's logical , '' Kudlow told me but the added jokingly `` You got some old codgers who are pretty healthy too . ''
Asked about how the federal government – practically speaking – can reopen parts of the economy that have shuttered given that local governments are by and large the ones calling the shots , Kudlow said it would come in the form of `` guidance '' and conceded that local governments are pulling many of the levers .

FEMA administrator says Defense Production Act powers will be used 'today '
A few hours after President Trump this morning tweeted his astonishment at the difficulty of obtaining face masks and ventilators from the international marketplace , FEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor said on CNN that the administration planned to use the Defense Production Act for the first time today during the COVID-19 outbreak .
`` We 're going to use the DPA for the first time today , '' Gaynor said , adding they would use `` the allocation portion of the DPA '' for `` about 60,000 test kits '' that `` we need to get our hands on . ''
Gaynor also said they would use the DPA Tuesday to `` insert some language into these mask contracts we have for the 500 million masks . ''
Trump tweeted hours before that the market is `` Crazy , '' as he acknowledged that it is `` not easy '' obtaining the desperately needed equipment for states .

Negotiators reach deal in principle on stimulus package

After a little under 15 hours of closed-door, bipartisan talks, White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland announced to reporters at about 1 a.m. local time that negotiators have a deal on the $2 trillion economic stimulus package.

They are still drafting some of this deal, but negotiators say they have an agreement.

""Ladies and gentlemen, we are done. We have a deal,"" Ueland said. ""Much of the work on the bill text has been completed and I’m hopeful over the next few hours [it will be finished] … We will circulate it early in the morning.”

Ueland said they “have either clear, explicit legislative text reflecting all parties, or we know exactly where we’re going to land without a legislative text, as we continue to finish.”

Sens. Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer were expected on the Senate floor overnight.

Negotiations took some five days to complete.

Trump says any decision to relax guidelines will be based on 'hard facts and data'

At the later afternoon White House briefing, President Trump continued to lay the groundwork for rolling back social distancing guidelines as he opened the daily coronavirus task force briefing and pointed to Easter as the end of the ""historic battle"" against COVID-19.

""Ultimately, the goal is to ease the guidelines and open things up to very large sections of our country as we near the end of our historic battle with the invisible enemy. It will go on for a while but we will win,"" Trump said. ""Easter is our timeline, what a great timeline that would be.""

As Dr. Anthony Fauci stood behind him, Trump said any decision on ""opening up"" the country would be ""based on hard facts and data.""

""Our decision will be based on hard facts and data, and I'm also hopeful to have Americans working -- again, by that beautiful Easter day. Rest assured every decision we make is grounded solely in the health, safety and well-being of our citizens,"" he said.

The president said the administration is ""working very hard to make that a reality"" an that ""we will be meeting with a lot of people to see if it can be done"" although it wasn't clear who, besides public health experts, would be advising him.

Dr. Deborah Birx said she and Fauci remain ""concerned"" about New York City and the New York metro area and said anyone who was in the region the last few days should self-quarantine for the next 14 days, based on the time they left New York.

Dr. Deborah Birx, White House coronavirus response coordinator, speaks about the coronavirus in the James Brady Briefing Room, Tuesday, March 24, 2020, in Washington. Alex Brandon/AP

""About 56% of all the cases in the United States are coming out of that metro area and 50% of all the new cases are coming out of the metro New York area, and 31% of the people succumbing to this disease,"" Birx said. ""It means, because they are still at the 31% mortality compared to the other regions of the country, that we could have a huge impact if we unite together.""

She continued that it ""will be very critical that those individuals do self quarantine in their homes over the next 14 days to make sure they don't pass the virus to others based on the time they left New York,"" she said

Fauci emphasized the same concerns, saying they're now seeing people spread the disease from New York to other parts of the country.

""It's a very serious situation and that suffered terribly through no fault of their own but what we are seeing now is understandably people want to get out of New York,"" Fauci said. ""The idea of self isolating for two weeks will be very important.""

As reporters started asking questions, Trump was asked if Easter was a realistic timeline for ending social distancing measures. ""I would love to see it come even sooner, but I think that would be a beautiful timeline,"" Trump said.

When Fauci was asked a similar question, if 19 days from now is a realistic timeline, Fauci said it was a ""flexible situation"" and pointed to the importance of studying areas of the country where the outbreak isn't obvious.

""That's very flexible. We just had a conversation with the president in the Oval Office talking about -- you can look at a date but you have to be very flexible on it, on a literal day-to-day basis, Fauci said.

""It's going to be looking at the data. What we don't have right now that we really do need is we need to know what's going on in those areas of the country, where there isn't an obvious outbreak. Is there something underneath the surface that says, wait a minute, you better be careful and clamp down? Or, are there things there that say you don't have to be as harsh as you are in other areas?"" he said.

""When you look at the country, obviously no one is going to want to tone down things when you see what's going on in a place like New York City. I mean, that's just good public health practice and common sense,"" Fauci said.

Trump: Would 'love to have the country opened up by Easter'

President Trump kept up his push to have America ""open for business very soon"" on a Fox News ""virtual town hall"" Tuesday afternoon from the White House Rose Garden.

He said he would ""love to have the country opened up by Easter"" which is April 12.

""It's such an important day for other reasons, but I will make it an important day for this: I would love to have the country opened up, and they are just raring to go, by Easter.""

""We lose thousands of people a year to the flu. We never turn the country off,"" Trump said, echoing what he said at his Monday night White House briefing. ""We lose much more than that to automobile accidents. We didn't call up the automobile companies and say, ‘Stop making cars. We don't want any cars anymore.’ We have to get back to work.""

The president issued full-throated support for people going back to work, though he said people would have to be smart about it.

""We have to go back to work much sooner than people thought,"" Trump said, amid reports the White House is considering a gradual scaling back of social distancing guidelines based on age and location.

""We can socially distance ourselves and go to work, and you have to work a little bit harder. And you can clean your hands five times more than you used to. You don't have to shake hands anymore, with people. That might be something good coming out of this,"" Trump said.

""I think it’s possible. Why isn’t it? We’ve never closed the country before and we’ve had some pretty bad flus,"" Trump said. ""We have to get our country back to work ... In my opinion, more people are going to die if we allow this to continue.""

""Look, you're going to lose a number of people to the flu. But you're going to lose more people by putting a country into a massive recession or depression. You're going to lose people. You're going to have suicides by the thousands. You're going to have all sorts of things happen,"" he said. ""You're going to have instability. You can't just come in and say, 'Let's close up the United States of America, the biggest -- the most successful country in the world by far.'

Easter is less than three weeks away meaning Trump would ""reopen"" the country right about the time New York is expected to hit its peak level of cases.

Amid fallout from public health officials that testing in the U.S. has lagged behind other countries, Trump emphasized a comment by Dr. Deborah Birx that the U.S. has now conducted more tests than South Korea.

""In a short period of time we’ve done more testing than South Korea,"" the president said, turning to Birx. ""I'd love you to say that one more time. That's a big number. We've done more than South Korea -- in a short period of time. We are doing more than South Korea by a lot.""

Birx said that while the U.S. has completed over 300,000 tests, ""We have more to do.""

""Is everything cool with you and Dr. Fauci?"" Trump was asked. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert and a key member of the coronavirus task force, has candidly contradicted the president on certain overstatements in recent days, including the president's optimism over drugs for coronavirus treatment despite no drugs currently being approved to treat it.

""He has other things to do. We get along very well ... we're fine, we're fine,"" Trump said, complimenting the team of doctors on the coronavirus task force as ""extraordinary.""

""If we delay this out, you are going to lose more people than you are losing with the situation as we know it,"" Trump said. ""I think it's very important for our country to go back. I've had many, many people -- when he said 'it's a little bit controversial' -- not to most people. Most people said I'm right about it.""

Trump envisions “packed churches” for Easter

Asked by Fox News’ Bill Hemmer in a one-on-one interview taped after an earlier town hall why he chose Easter as the date by which he wanted the country “opened up,” Trump said one reason is because it would be “beautiful” to have the churches full.

“Easter’s a very special day for me. And I see it’s sort of in that timeline that I’m thinking about. And I say, wouldn’t it be great to have all of the churches full?” Trump said. “I think Easter Sunday -- and you’ll have packed churches all over our country -- I think it would be a beautiful time.”

“And it’s just about the timeline that I think is right,” the president continued. “It gives us more of a chance to work on what we’re doing. And I’m not sure that’s going to be the day, but I would like to aim it right at Easter Sunday.”

What’s happening

The United States Postal Service has been in financial trouble for years. The added pressure brought on by the coronavirus pandemic has brought it to the brink of collapse.

Mail volume has dropped dramatically because of the outbreak, robbing the USPS of its most profitable revenue stream. The agency expects to run out of money by September and have a net operating loss of $54 billion in the near future. Without significant help, “the Postal Service could cease to exist,” the chairwoman of the House Oversight Committee said.

The USPS has been a fixture of American life since 1775. For most of its history, it operated as a typical government service. That changed in 1970, when it was turned into an independent agency that was expected to run like a business without financial support from taxpayers. That arrangement was largely successful until the mid-2000s, when a combination of new laws that restricted its income and the emergence of digital alternatives crippled its budget.

The Postal Service frequently ranks as Americans’ favorite federal agency, with approval ratings as high as 90 percent. But it has recently drawn the ire of President Trump, who incorrectly blames its financial troubles on low prices it charges Amazon for package delivery services. “The Postal Service is a joke,” Trump said last month.

Why there’s debate

Political divisions have also informed proposed solutions for rescuing the Postal Service. According to USPS leaders and many liberal lawmakers, the best solution is a massive infusion of cash. Democrats have pushed to include billions in additional funding for the agency in the trillion-dollar stimulus packages recently passed by Congress, but Trump reportedly threatened to veto any bill that included a bailout for the USPS.

Beyond funds to survive the current crisis, the USPS needs fundamental changes to free it from the circumstances that were tanking its finances long before the pandemic came along, some argue. The agency’s current structure — in which it has all of the revenue-generating responsibilities of a private business but still has its policies dictated by Congress — is seen as unsustainable by many. In 2006, a Republican-led Congress passed a law requiring the Postal Service to put away enough funds to cover retirement and pension costs for its employees for the next 75 years. Without that law, which some argue was part of a deliberate attempt to bankrupt the agency, the Postal Service would have actually made a profit in recent years, according to analysts.

Some conservatives argue that the best path for the Postal Service is for it to no longer be part of the government at all, but instead become a private company free from congressional restraints.

What’s next

The Trump administration announced Wednesday that the current head of the USPS will be replaced by a top Republican donor in June, which could be a precursor to the service implementing some of the changes in package fees the president has demanded. Funding for the Postal Service may be a key point of contention during debate over the next congressional stimulus bill. Democrats are expected to push for $25 billion to keep the USPS afloat. But that provision may need enough Republican support to override a potential veto from Trump.

During the 2008 stimulus program , up to 90 % of the rise in durable good spending had to do with auto spending , according to previous research by the American Economic Association . ( At that time , the government paid an individual between $ 300 and $ 600 and couples received between $ 600 and $ 1,200 . The government paid $ 300 per child as well . )
When Americans received their $ 1,200 stimulus check , as many have used it to keep a roof over their head and food on the table , according to new research by a team of economists . In late March , lawmakers passed the $ 2.2 trillion CARES Act , which included $ 290 billion in direct payments . The program allowed $ 1,200 for people making less than $ 75,000 and couples making less than $ 150,000 . It also paid $ 500 per child .
“ ‘ Given the size of the 2020 stimulus checks , we might have expected large impacts on categories like automobile spending , electronics , appliances , and home furnishings . ’ ”
“ Given the size of the 2020 stimulus checks , we might have expected large impacts on categories like automobile spending , electronics , appliances , and home furnishings , ” according to economists at Columbia University , Northwestern University , the University of Chicago and the University of Southern Denmark .
“ Instead , it seems that individuals are catching up with rent and bill payments as well as engaging in spending on food , personal care , and nondurables . ”
Looking at the spending and saving habits of more than 1,600 people who received their stimulus check by April 21 in an approximate 6,000-person sample , the researchers found :
• In the first three days after the stimulus-check receipt , spending increased between $ 50 to $ 75 apiece on expenditures like food and non-durable goods , a category that includes supplies like laundry detergent , pens , paper and other items with a shorter life span .
• During that same time , the purchase of durable goods increased by $ 20 in those first three days . This category includes cars , appliances , furniture and others things meant for longer use .
• On the whole , households spent around one quarter to one third of their stimulus check money within 10 days of receipt .
See also : Do I have to pay back my $ 1,200 stimulus check ? Don ’ t fall for these 5 myths about the stimulus payments
• If people had less than $ 500 in their account , they went through almost half of their money within 10 days . People with over $ 3,000 in their accounts had essentially no extra spending after getting their check .
• A person who made less than $ 1,000 a month was twice as likely to spend money after getting their check , compared to someone making at least $ 5,000 , researchers noted . That fits a historical pattern from past stimulus programs , the study said .
In the wake of stimulus bills during 2008 and 2001 , “ households with either larger declines in net worth or households with lower levels of assets also tend to respond more strongly to stimulus checks . ”
It ’ s too soon to see what the stimulus checks accomplish for families and the economy as a whole , Columbia Business School Professor R. A. Farrokhnia , the study ’ s co-author , told ███ . “ What we can tell for fact is consumer behavior is different , ” compared to their 2008 stimulus spending habits .
“ ‘ Household spending on food delivery was one category in particular that increased following the receipt of a stimulus check . ’ ”
Researchers looked at anonymous data from users at SaverLife , a financial-technology company that incentivizes savings through things like cash rewards .
Farrokhnia noted many have been hit hard in the past two months , but didn ’ t necessarily find it alarming that more money was going to food , rent , bill and nondurables compared to durable goods . After all , he noted , a family might not want a stranger coming in to install a new washing machine or they might not have a reason to buy a new car with fewer places to visit .
Farrokhnia and his fellow authors wrote that many outlets for consumer spending were shuttered by government orders , but restaurants stayed open for pickups and deliveries . “ Household spending on food delivery was one category in particular that increased following the receipt of a stimulus check , ” the study said .
Time will tell how people use all their stimulus money , Farrokhnia said , noting the spending trailed off 10 days from receipt ; many people might be holding onto the rest to see what the future holds , he added . However , he does wonder whether these $ 1,200 checks will be enough “ to spur consumer spending to fuel economic recovery . ”
Don ’ t miss : ‘ It removes the concerns of the immediate future. ’ How some people are planning to spend their stimulus checks
The study , distributed this week by the National Bureau of Economic Research , is another look at how the coronavirus outbreak and its economic consequences suddenly left many American families cash strapped — especially those making lower incomes .
On Wednesday , Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said 40 % of people in households making less than $ 40,000 per year in February lost their jobs in March . When April ’ s rent came due , nearly one-third of renters struggled to pay it , data said .
The Internal Revenue Service has distributed more than 128 million checks and paid over $ 218 billion as of early May .
The new study comes as lawmakers debate another bill addressing the outbreak ’ s economic repercussions . The Democrat-backed $ 3 trillion HEROES act would , among other things , authorize another round of $ 1,200 direct payments per eligible individual . Payouts would be capped at $ 6,000 per household .
Senator Mitch McConnell , the Republican majority leader , is already brushing off the bill , calling it “ the aspirations of the Democratic majority in the House . ”","When Americans received stimulus checks during the Great Recession, studies indicated many spent at least of portion of their money on cars.

The Internal Revenue Service has distributed more than 128 million checks and paid over $218 billion as of early May.

The new study comes as lawmakers debate another bill addressing the outbreak’s economic repercussions. The Democrat-backed $3 trillion HEROES act would, among other things, authorize another round of $1,200 direct payments per eligible individual. Payouts would be capped at $6,000 per household.

Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, is already brushing off the bill, calling it “the aspirations of the Democratic majority in the House.”",www.marketwatch.com,right,n7e6ExNQI3nrLi8G

Konrad isn't buying that criticism: ""That's obviously complete bullshit. Consumers are absolutely certain of what they're buying when they buy our product, which is why we've seen such stratospheric growth.""

Speaking fondly of economic growth in any capacity is exceedingly rare among climate activists, where markets are often seen a major contributor to climate change. Impossible Foods takes the opposite position there. While Konrad says she has some issues with capitalism, ""the reality is that we don't have time to shift the economic system in the entire world in order to fix it, in order to then fix climate change…we need to leverage every single thing that we can. And I don't know if you're going to find a more powerful lever right now than capitalism, consumer demand, and consumers' rational behavior.""

A new playbook

Fed in focus

Mike Mayo, managing director and head of U.S. large-cap bank research at Wells Fargo Securities, said the Fed would do well to let its policies from the previous recession work: ""We've run over 200 earnings models.

What’s happening

The coronavirus pandemic is, first and foremost, a health crisis, but it has also had a profound economic impact. The unemployment rate in the U.S. was 3.5 percent in February. By April, amid a nationwide shutdown to stem the spread of the virus, it had risen to 14.7 percent, the highest rate since the Great Depression. Before the outbreak, the U.S. economy had been enjoying the longest period of growth in history.

The current recession is different from other recent downturns, like the 2008 financial collapse, which saw a more gradual decline caused by instability within the economy itself. The virus, however, caused the economy to collapse almost overnight. Some economic indicators rebounded strongly as lockdowns were lifted in parts of the country, raising hopes of a V-shaped recovery in which things return to normal as rapidly as they had declined. President Trump called the economy “a rocket ship” after the release of promising unemployment numbers in early June.

Despite those gains, there are signs that the recovery is stalling as the number of COVID-19 cases spike in several parts of the country. It’s too soon to know the full economic impact of major outbreaks that have hit states like Arizona, Florida and California. But some economists have expressed concern that the economy may be on the brink of a true collapse.

Why there’s debate

Though the recent resurgence in the virus may make a V-shaped recovery unlikely, there are still reasons for optimism. Though key economic indicators like unemployment and consumer spending suggest a dire scenario, the actual impact of the downturn on Americans may be less extreme than those numbers may indicate.

A $2 trillion stimulus package passed by Congress in March — which included $1,200 direct payments, boosted unemployment payments by $600 a week and hundreds of billions of dollars in loans for businesses — has been credited with preventing the worst-case scenario for the economy over the past few months. Bans on evictions at the federal and state level, along with mortgage relief, have helped struggling families remain in their homes. The stock market has regained most of the losses it suffered at the onset of the pandemic.

These hopeful signs may be hiding the true state of an economy on the brink of another major crash that sends the country into a depression, some economists fear. One of the major reasons for concern is the end of many measures that have kept the nation afloat. Enhanced unemployment is set to expire at the end of July, and the loans may not be enough for businesses to keep their doors open. Eviction moratoriums are also due to end soon. State budgets have cratered because of lost tax revenue.

It’s unclear whether Congress would be willing to spend more money to keep these programs running and bail out states. A worst-case scenario envisioned by economists could see federal assistance drying up at the same time businesses begin to shut down en mass, state government jobs disappear and millions of Americans lose their homes. The combined result of all these crises hitting at once could even spark another financial collapse like the one that caused the Great Recession, experts fear.

What’s next

Democrats in the House of Representatives passed a $3 trillion stimulus bill in May that would, among other things, extend enhanced unemployment and provide another round of stimulus checks. The Republicans in the Senate and the Trump administration appear to be eyeing a smaller package that totals less than $1 trillion. A final stimulus bill is expected by the end of the month, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said.

The U.S. Capitol building is seen at sunset in Washington , U.S. May 17 , 2017 . ███/Zach Gibson
Republican Vice President Mike Pence appeared on the Senate floor at 10:11 p.m. EDT ( 0211 GMT ) to cast the tie-breaking vote as the chamber ’ s president and approve the most significant roll-back of Obama-era financial policy since President Donald Trump took office vowing to loosen the leash on Wall Street . The final count was 51 to 50 .
The Republican-dominated House of Representatives has already passed the resolution repealing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) rule released in July . The resolution also bars regulators from instituting a similar ban in the future .
After a signature from Trump , expected soon , the resolution will abruptly end a years-long fight that has included multiple federal regulators , consumer advocacy groups , and financial lobbyists .
CFPB Director Richard Cordray , a Democrat appointed by former President Barack Obama , rarely comments on congressional action but on Tuesday night said “ Wall Street won and ordinary people lost . ”
“ This vote means the courtroom doors will remain closed for groups of people seeking justice and relief when they are wronged by a company , ” he added .
Customers must agree to the clauses as a condition of opening accounts , saying they will take any disputes to closed-door arbitration instead of joining class-action lawsuits , where complainants band together to share litigation costs .

Republican Vice President Mike Pence appeared on the Senate floor at 10:11 p.m. EDT (0211 GMT) to cast the tie-breaking vote as the chamber’s president and approve the most significant roll-back of Obama-era financial policy since President Donald Trump took office vowing to loosen the leash on Wall Street. The final count was 51 to 50.

The Republican-dominated House of Representatives has already passed the resolution repealing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rule released in July. The resolution also bars regulators from instituting a similar ban in the future.

After a signature from Trump, expected soon, the resolution will abruptly end a years-long fight that has included multiple federal regulators, consumer advocacy groups, and financial lobbyists.

CFPB Director Richard Cordray, a Democrat appointed by former President Barack Obama, rarely comments on congressional action but on Tuesday night said “Wall Street won and ordinary people lost.”

“This vote means the courtroom doors will remain closed for groups of people seeking justice and relief when they are wronged by a company,” he added.

Customers must agree to the clauses as a condition of opening accounts, saying they will take any disputes to closed-door arbitration instead of joining class-action lawsuits, where complainants band together to share litigation costs. The clauses are used for nearly every U.S. consumer product and service since the Supreme Court ruled them legal in 2011.

Victims of the Equifax Inc. (EFX.N) hack were outraged last month when the company included forced arbitration fine print in offering them free credit monitoring. The company later removed the clauses.

Officials say the currency , internally called `` digital currency/electronic payment '' ( DC/EP ) , is not intended to replace all money or even to be offered nationwide , and is in part an experiment to prepare for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics . At the same time , the PBOC boasts that DC/EP will `` combat money laundering , gambling and terror financing '' while `` [ improving ] the efficiency of transactions in its financial system . '' It is a good bet that if the Chinese government is pleased with the results of this experiment , it will extend DC/EP to corral more financial transactions .

Of course , convenience can be costly . There is cause for concern whenever data or property can be centralized if for no other ███ than it is easier to target .

Every day , we give companies a raw look into our lives and loves without a moment 's thought .
Formally creating a state-run digital currency is just the next logical step in China 's progression towards financial digitization . Of course , the PBOC promises that DC/EP will `` protect users ' privacy . '' Do you believe that ? Without more details on how the system will work , few people will .
As Coin Center 's Neeraj Agrawal points out , there is a big and important difference between `` private '' as in `` we promise not to look at the data '' and `` private '' as in `` we do n't have the data . '' Which setup do you think a government would prefer ?
Westerners may be tempted to assume that the surveillance risk of the PBOC 's proposed DC/EP follows from the unique authoritarianism of the Chinese state . After all , we hear story after story of the Chinese government targeting religious minorities , censoring pictures of Winnie the Pooh ( among other things ) , and cracking down on Hong Kongers . The problem is n't with a government digital currency per se , you might conclude . The problem is that the Chinese government is uniquely oppressive .

A Wall Street bundler with ties to former President Barack Obama and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, has recently noticed a surge in calls being returned by uncommitted finance executives to now give to Biden. This person has also pitched donors that if they donate, they may have a better chance at seeing their philanthropic initiatives supported by a Biden administration.

Economic anxiety

Coronavirus concerns

Some on Wall Street are slowly changing their bets to Biden, despite their financial successes under the Trump administration, is the president's handling of the coronavirus. Trump has come under scrutiny and withering criticism by lawmakers and activists for being what they see as either too slow to react to the pandemic or for not doing enough to help states. Finance executives have become infuriated watching what they believe is the U.S. struggling to overcome the pandemic while their political and business allies in Europe have had more success in combating the virus. Data cited by The Hill shows that there are now close to 30,000 new cases per day in the United States while in the European Union there are close to 3,000 cases each day. ""It's an article of faith among Wall Streeter's to know that the U.S. is structurally superior to Europe. Watching Europe outperform us on Covid-19 burns them,"" said an analyst at an asset management firm. Robert Wolf, the founder of 32 Advisors, a holding company which includes the direct investing arm 32 Ventures, told CNBC that since the coronavirus started spreading through the U.S., he's been emailing close to 175 influential people, including CEOs and politicians, giving his take on the pandemic, markets, the election – and how he sees Biden standing above Trump. Wolf is a former CEO of UBS Americas, previously an advisor to Obama and a current Biden supporter. He wrote to his email list just after Memorial Day that taxes were going to be raised under Biden, but he justified the idea because, as he puts it, fighting the coronavirus is the equivalent to how a government goes to war. Taxing the rich, then, is a necessary decision, according to Wolf. ""Everyone must do their part. Our medical professionals, front line workers, first responders and business owners who were forced to close their shops have certainly done so,"" Wolf said in a email titled ""War & Taxes."" ""We will need the wealthy and high income earners to do their part financially, as they've done following previous wars,"" the email said.

The meeting between the two presidents , which hadn ’ t been scheduled , will focus on easing tensions that have been rising since a potential trade deal fell apart in May . Mr. Trump said the U.S. and Chinese teams will pave the way for negotiations before the summit , scheduled for June 28-29 in Osaka , Japan .
“ Had a very good telephone conversation with President Xi of China , ” Mr. Trump tweeted Tuesday morning as markets opened . Stocks rose about 1.35 % on the development , with the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbing 353.01 points to close at 26.465.54 .
“ China wants a deal , ” the president told reporters as he headed for Florida for the official launch rally of his reelection campaign .
But even as Mr. Trump announced a new opening for a possible agreement with China , the president also picked a fresh fight with the European Union over monetary policy . He criticized European Central Bank President Mario Draghi for considering more monetary stimulus in Europe , saying the move would make it easier for the EU to “ compete against the USA ” by weakening the euro against the dollar .
“ They have been getting away with this for years , along with China and others , ” Mr. Trump tweeted .
The meeting with Mr. Xi moved markets partly because there had been speculation that the Chinese leader would not even show up for the summit . The president ’ s announcement put that to rest , although his administration is downplaying hopes for a deal at the summit .
“ Our position will continue to be we want structural changes here , ” White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters . “ We want structural changes on all the items — theft of [ intellectual property ] , forced transfer of technology , cyber hacking , of course trade barriers . We ’ ve got to have something that ’ s enforceable . They ’ ll have a good conversation . ”
China ’ s state broadcaster CCTV reported that Mr. Xi told Mr. Trump the bilateral relationship has “ encountered some difficulties , which is not in the interest of either side. ” Mr. Xi also told the president that “ we also hope that the U.S. will treat Chinese companies fairly , ” an apparent reference to recent U.S. actions against telecommunications giant Huawei over 5G networks ’ security .
The two sides seemed close to a deal in mid-May , but the U.S. accused China of reneging on a commitment to enshrine into law any changes to its trade policy . Mr. Trump then slapped 25 % tariffs on more than $ 200 billion worth of Chinese goods .
Beijing , which denied backing away from any commitments , retaliated with tariffs on U.S. goods , especially agricultural products . Mr. Trump approved a $ 16 billion bailout for U.S. farmers and said he is content to dig in with even more tariffs on nearly all Chinese imports .
That vow rattled the business community and lawmakers of both parties , because tariff costs often are passed on to companies and consumers .
At a hearing Tuesday , Sen. Ron Wyden , Oregon Democrat , told U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer that another round of tariffs would hurt families buying school supplies for the fall — “ school uniforms , gym clothes , sneakers , book bags , pencils , notebooks , you name it . ”
Mr. Lighthizer replied , “ I would say to those college students that if China steals your intellectual property , you ’ re not going to have jobs in the future . ”
Mr. Kudlow said the administration is “ seeing evidence ” that the tariff war is hurting China more than the U.S .
“ American customers of China products don ’ t have to stay with China , ” he said . “ They can go to Vietnam , Bangladesh , Mexico and so forth . That ’ s where the economic burden falls most heavily on the Chinese . Their companies , they ’ re losing market share . A lot of importers in the U.S. go elsewhere . ”
Mr. Trump also rebuked Mr. Draghi , who said in a speech in Portugal that he was open to printing more currency if Europe ’ s economy doesn ’ t improve . The move could result in interest-rate cuts and hurt the dollar relative to the euro , raising concern about a currency war in which both sides would lower their currencies ’ value to seek a trade advantage .
The ECB is forecasting that economic growth will slide to 1.2 % this year in the 19 countries that use the euro , compared with growth of 1.8 % in 2018 .

But we should watch what they do. The Fed can destroy your savings and your future. The current crew of Fed bureaucrats has raised the Fed’s balance sheet to a stunning $4 trillion dollars.

As Sen. Rand Paul’s father, retired Texas Congressman Ron Paul, put it, “No secret cabal of government officials should have the authority to create money out of thin air.”

He makes a good point.

For three decades, Ron Paul was virtually alone among politicians in questioning the Fed. But now there are more. This month, I struggled to find guests who would defend the Fed on my TV show.

Jim Bruce’s documentary “Money for Nothing” is a great beginner’s guide to the Fed. Bruce points out that the last two Fed chairmen, appointed by both Republicans and Democrats, have quietly increased central planning of our economy. Government now controls more of our economy than ever before. This is not a good thing.

The Fed was created to prevent bank runs. It would be a lender of last resort and create stability.

Yet 16 years after the Fed’s creation, the Fed’s low interest rates fueled the Roaring Twenties and led to the greatest stock market crash in history. Then the Fed’s tight money worsened the Depression.

I’m told they learned from their mistakes. For four decades after that, the Fed usually kept increases in the size of the money supply gradual, steady and predictable. Except for one nasty period, inflation has been kept in check.

But now the Fed is charged with two sometimes clashing missions: preserving a stable currency and reducing unemployment.

There’s great pressure for the Fed to time these decisions just right in order to avoid economic downturns and -- some argue -- to make current political officeholders look good. Increasingly, investors and Wall Street analysts obsess over what the Fed will do, instead of paying attention to inventions, productivity and real wealth-creation.

The Fed, created to shore up capitalism, has become an instrument of government economic management not so different from a socialist planning board: a tiny handful of powerful people attempt to fine-tune the entire economy. Its main mission has become continually goosing economic activity through infusions of new cash to maintain the illusion that good times will never falter.

The result isn’t stability, but one economic bubble after another.

The Fed’s manipulations fit well with President Obama’s “stimulus spending” efforts. But neither seems to do the trick. This post-recession “recovery” is among the weakest ever. Japan’s central bank tried the same stimulus for the past 15 years, since its economic crash. That didn’t work either.

The number of confirmed worldwide cases was approaching 115,000 early Tuesday. The death toll from the virus has now topped 4,000 — including 26 in the U.S.

Trump’s comment that he will seek relief for workers gave some investors an excuse to resume buying.

“This is not like the financial crisis where we don’t know the end is in sight,” said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. “This is about providing proper tools and liquidity to get through the next few months.”

One reason why stocks were poised to move higher: The biggest rebounds have historically occurred following sharp drops on Mondays, according to Bespoke Investment Group.

Since 1952, the S&P 500 index has dropped at least 5% on Mondays ten times, with yesterday’s 7.6% drop marking the eleventh time. Following all ten of those Mondays, the broad index has gained more than 2.2% the next trading day.

On Tuesday, oil prices also recovered some of their losses. Crude plunged 25% on Monday after Russia refused to roll back production in response to virus-depressed demand. Saudi Arabia signaled it will ramp up its own output.

Benchmark U.S. crude gained 3.2%, or $1.00, to $32.13 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It lost 25% on Monday to $31.13 per barrel. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, gained 5.1%, or $1.68, to $36.04 per barrel in London.

The yield on U.S. Treasury bonds edged up to 0.67% after falling as low as 0.5% as investors shifted money into safe-haven assets. It had never been below 1% until last week.

In Europe, London’s FTSE 100 rose and Frankfurt’s DAX advanced TK%. The CAC 40 in France gained 1.4%. The Shanghai Composite Index rose and the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo advanced. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng climbed 1.4%.

“ As we have put it , ‘ fix the roof while the sun shines ’ . But , like many of you , I see storm clouds building and fear the work on crisis prevention is incomplete . ”

Third , universities are great connectors of capital and culture . The presence of world-class universities played an irreplaceable role in shaping the culture of Silicon Valley ( Stanford ) , Boston ( Harvard , MIT ) , Austin ( University of Texas ) , and other centers of American innovation . Institutions of higher learning contributed a great deal to New York City and Los Angeles as well , though those metropolises are too large to be dominated by the influence of a single institution or two . Having a great university is not enough on its own — New Haven and Princeton remain backwaters — but such an institution can be a magnet for innovative people , ideas , and capital . The contemporary conservative habit of sneering at them ( as opposed to reforming what needs reforming in them , which is good and necessary work ) goes right along with the bumptious cultural posture that has cost the Republican Party the allegiance of the affluent , educated suburbanites and urban professionals who once were its bulwark .
There is more to competitiveness than a low cost of doing business — that is why so much more foreign direct investment comes to the United States than to China , and why the countries that see the most foreign direct investment are mostly not poor : Investors are not flocking to Germany or the Netherlands in search of low wages and tax rates or less regulation . There were many places in the United States where it would have been a lot cheaper to operate a stock exchange than in Manhattan .
If we want to be the home to the next Wall Street or the next Silicon Valley , then we should think about how those ecosystems came to be . And if the answers do not fit into neat ideological narratives , then the problem is probably with our ideologies rather than our history .","(Carlo Allegri/Reuters)

Second, leaders in the so-called red states who wonder why their low taxes and lighter regulatory burden isn’t enough to get an Apple or a Facebook to move there should think long and hard about culture. In Republican-leaning Texas, it is progressive Austin and internationally minded Houston that are home to the most forward-looking businesses and industry groups. Dallas does okay, too, but it is missing something at the heart of Austin’s success — and Boston’s success and Silicon Valley’s, too. Which brings us to . . .

Third, universities are great connectors of capital and culture. The presence of world-class universities played an irreplaceable role in shaping the culture of Silicon Valley (Stanford), Boston (Harvard, MIT), Austin (University of Texas), and other centers of American innovation. Institutions of higher learning contributed a great deal to New York City and Los Angeles as well, though those metropolises are too large to be dominated by the influence of a single institution or two. Having a great university is not enough on its own — New Haven and Princeton remain backwaters — but such an institution can be a magnet for innovative people, ideas, and capital. The contemporary conservative habit of sneering at them (as opposed to reforming what needs reforming in them, which is good and necessary work) goes right along with the bumptious cultural posture that has cost the Republican Party the allegiance of the affluent, educated suburbanites and urban professionals who once were its bulwark.

There is more to competitiveness than a low cost of doing business — that is why so much more foreign direct investment comes to the United States than to China, and why the countries that see the most foreign direct investment are mostly not poor: Investors are not flocking to Germany or the Netherlands in search of low wages and tax rates or less regulation. There were many places in the United States where it would have been a lot cheaper to operate a stock exchange than in Manhattan.

If we want to be the home to the next Wall Street or the next Silicon Valley, then we should think about how those ecosystems came to be. And if the answers do not fit into neat ideological narratives, then the problem is probably with our ideologies rather than our history.",www.nationalreview.com,right,5TbZcBwWe8ANeuHQ

NEW YORK ( AP ) — The billions of dollars in coronavirus relief targeted at small businesses may not prevent many of them from ending up in bankruptcy court .
Business filings under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law rose sharply in March , and attorneys who work with struggling companies are seeing signs that more owners are contemplating the possibility of bankruptcy .
Companies forced to close or curtail business due to government attempts to stop the virus ’ s spread have mounting debts and uncertain prospects for returning to normal operations . Even those owners receiving emergency loans and grants aren ’ t sure that help will be enough .
The most vulnerable companies include the thousands of restaurants and retailers that shut down , many of them more than a month ago . Some restaurants have managed to bring in a bit of revenue by serving meals for takeout and delivery , but even they are struggling financially . Small and independent retailers , including those with online stores . are similarly at risk ; clothing retailers have the added problem of winter inventory that they are unlikely to sell with spring here and summer approaching .

Even with the money , she doesn ’ t know if the revenue will cover the bills when she ’ s finally able to reopen Zazie — especially if she ’ s required to space tables six feet apart for social distancing .
“ Our occupancy is going to be cut 60 % to 65 % , ” Bennett says . “ I fear bankruptcy is a possibility . ”
Other small companies have similar anxieties , says Paul Singerman , a bankruptcy attorney with Berger Singerman in Miami .
“ There is no reliable visibility into when business operations will be able to resume the pre-COVID normal , ” Singerman says .

The number of Chapter 11 filings rose 18 percent in March from a year earlier , a dramatic swing from the 20 percent decrease in February , according to the American Bankruptcy Institute , a trade organization for attorneys and other professionals involved in bankruptcy proceedings . The numbers don ’ t break out filings by company size , but given that the vast majority of companies are small to mid-size , it does give an indication that smaller companies are struggling .
The federal government has already approved or given out more than 2 million loans and grants to small businesses totaling nearly $ 360 billion ; another $ 310 billion is on the way to one of the programs . Still , the money may be at best a stopgap for companies with little to no revenue coming in . And the new funds are expected to go so quickly that thousands of owners won ’ t get loans .
There ’ s no way to predict how many companies will file for bankruptcy . There were over 160,000 bankruptcy filings from 2008 to 2010 , during the Great Recession and its aftermath , according to statistics compiled by the federal court system .

Many companies , however , just shut their doors , and that ’ s likely to be the case again , Singerman says . According to some estimates , 170,000 companies failed during the recession .
But the Small Business Reorganization Act , which took effect in February , may encourage more companies to seek Chapter 11 . The law is aimed at allowing owners to retain their ownership rather than lose their companies to their creditors ; that is generally what happens in Chapter 11 .

Business owners will try to avoid bankruptcy by seeking leniency from landlords , lenders and vendors , bankruptcy attorney David Wander says .

NEW YORK (AP) — The billions of dollars in coronavirus relief targeted at small businesses may not prevent many of them from ending up in bankruptcy court.

Business filings under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law rose sharply in March, and attorneys who work with struggling companies are seeing signs that more owners are contemplating the possibility of bankruptcy.

Companies forced to close or curtail business due to government attempts to stop the virus’s spread have mounting debts and uncertain prospects for returning to normal operations. Even those owners receiving emergency loans and grants aren’t sure that help will be enough.

John Hickenlooper , former Maryland Rep. John Delaney and former Texas Rep. Beto O ’ Rourke , though fewally know his positions .
Bankers ’ biggest fear : The nomination goes to an anti-Wall Street crusader like Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D-Mass . ) or Sanders . “ It can ’ t be Warren and it can ’ t be Sanders , ” said the CEO of another giant bank . “ It has to be someone centrist and someone who can win . ”
Robert Wolf , an investment banker , founder of 32 Advisors and former adviser and fundraiser for Obama , echoed that sentiment but suggested it was too soon to declare anyone unelectable .
“ We just haven ’ t seen this many candidates running in our party . The Republicans went through that , but we haven ’ t , ” he said . “ There is a lot of excitement about where the party is going , and we will all have friends running , and it ’ s hard to decide who to support . Our party likes the aspirational , exciting candidate , but we also have to find someone who can do well in the swing states . ”
For Democratic candidates , seeking Wall Street support in the 2020 race will be tricky . The allure of cash to report on initial fundraising filings remains strong . Booker , Harris and Gillibrand have all taken meetings or made calls to top Democrats on Wall Street gauging potential financial support .
But news reports of such meetings often draw swift social media backlash from progressives who don ’ t want the 2020 nominee to have anything to do with Wall Street “ fat cats “ and view higher taxes on the wealthy and stronger banking regulations as sacrosanct positions for any potential nominee to hold .
After CNBC reported earlier this month on Gillibrand making calls to bankers to gauge potential support for a 2020 bid , the senator tweeted a list of her progressive credentials on the banking industry including support for a financial transactions tax , reinstating a wall between retail and investment banking and opposing the bank bailouts of 2008 .
In several interviews , Wall Street executives cited these positions as reasons they were skeptical of Gillibrand as a candidate and unlikely to support her unless she catches fire and emerges from the field . “ It will be an interesting test to see if people actually step up and support her , ” one senior executive at a large bank said . “ There is not a lot of trust there . ”
But Gillibrand does have Wall Street backers who view her as pragmatic , a centrist and preferable to Warren or Sanders .
“ She understands Wall Street , but she is not owned by Wall Street , ” said Larry Rand , a Wall Street veteran and visiting professor of economics at Brown University . “ Wall Street likes her because she is a pragmatist , not an ideologue , and of the announced candidates so far she is the most electable . ”
A person close to Gillibrand noted the senator ’ s strong support for banking regulation and said any meetings with people at financial firms should not indicate a willingness to change positions on anything .
Overall in 2020 , financial support from Wall Street and corporate America is likely to be somewhat less important . Democratic candidates are mostly swearing off any donations from corporate political action committees and are committed to raising small dollar amounts from grassroots donors , mostly online . Warren has urged all candidates to swear off support from any outside PACs and also criticized anyone who self-funds , a clear shot at Bloomberg .
Warren and Sanders both have formidable digital fundraising operations , as do Gillibrand and Harris . O ’ Rourke broke fundraising records last year in his unsuccessful Texas Senate run , drawing in $ 80 million .
But the allure of wealthy donors who can write the maximum $ 2,700 checks to candidates — and billionaires who can fund outside super PACs — will remain , especially given the competition for small dollar online donations and the pressure to put up solid fundraising numbers in early reporting periods to show momentum .
“ People are still calling and showing up . They just don ’ t want to be seen doing it , ” a senior Wall Street executive who has worked in Democratic politics said .
Pete Buttigieg , the Democratic mayor of South Bend , Ind. , who just entered the presidential race running at least in part as a voice of fiscal prudence , said in an interview that he would not shy away from seeking Wall Street cash . “ But I ’ m not sure they would be too wild about me anyway , ” he said , noting that he too is focused on small dollar , grassroots donors .
While Bloomberg represents something of the platonic ideal on Wall Street — fiscally responsible while strong on climate change and gun policy and not in need of cash — Biden represents something of a wild card .
The former vice president does not have deep relationships across Wall Street , but he ’ s viewed favorably as a candidate who could win and would take a somewhat more moderate approach on taxes and regulation . But there are concerns about his age and his penchant for gaffes .
“ Everybody likes him . I don ’ t know if you want him to be president at 78 in 2020 , but it looks like he ’ s in great shape , ” said one hedge fund manager and top Democratic donor . “ If it ’ s Biden and Beto or Biden and Harris , that might make a difference . The good news for Biden is everyone likes him . The bad news is there is not a lot of passion . ”
Among the most hardcore Democrats on Wall Street , the strong desire is to find a candidate — any candidate — who can beat Trump , even if that means getting behind someone like Warren who supports policies that bankers hate .
“ Everybody just wants to win , ” a second senior executive who has worked in Democratic politics at the presidential level said . “ It ’ s as wide open as I ’ ve ever seen it . There is no gravitational force that everyone is sort of running towards . Everyone has their candidate . Frankly , if people believed Warren would win , they ’ d jump on board . And everyone in the top tier not named Bernie Sanders could probably win . ”","Many executives are pining for a centrist candidate like former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, but realize the eventual Democratic nominee may well veer further left. | Allison Joyce/Getty Images 2020 Elections Wall Street freaks out about 2020 Many of the nation’s top bankers want Trump gone, but they’re growing anxious about some Democratic presidential contenders.

NEW YORK — Top Wall Street executives would love to be rid of President Donald Trump. But they are getting panicked about the prospect of an ultraliberal Democratic nominee bent on raising taxes and slapping regulations on their firms.

The result is a kind of nervous paralysis of executives pining for a centrist nominee like Michael Bloomberg while realizing such an outcome is unlikely from a party veering sharply to the left.

Early support from deep-pocketed financial executives could give Democrats seeking to break out of the pack an important fundraising boost. But any association with bankers also opens presidential hopefuls to sharp attacks from an ascendant left.

And it’s left senior executives on Wall Street flailing over what to do.

“I’m a socially liberal, fiscally conservative centrist who would love to vote for a rational Democrat and get Trump out of the White House,” said the CEO of one of the nation’s largest banks, who, like a dozen other executives interviewed for this story, declined to be identified by name for fear of angering a volatile president. “Personally, I’d love to see Bloomberg run and get the nomination. I’ve just never thought he could get the nomination the way the primary process works.”

Bankers’ biggest fear: The nomination goes to an anti-Wall Street crusader like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) or Sanders. “It can’t be Warren and it can’t be Sanders,” said the CEO of another giant bank. “It has to be someone centrist and someone who can win.”

Robert Wolf, an investment banker, founder of 32 Advisors and former adviser and fundraiser for Obama, echoed that sentiment but suggested it was too soon to declare anyone unelectable.

“We just haven’t seen this many candidates running in our party. The Republicans went through that, but we haven’t,” he said. “There is a lot of excitement about where the party is going, and we will all have friends running, and it’s hard to decide who to support. Our party likes the aspirational, exciting candidate, but we also have to find someone who can do well in the swing states.”

For Democratic candidates, seeking Wall Street support in the 2020 race will be tricky. The allure of cash to report on initial fundraising filings remains strong. Booker, Harris and Gillibrand have all taken meetings or made calls to top Democrats on Wall Street gauging potential financial support.

But news reports of such meetings often draw swift social media backlash from progressives who don’t want the 2020 nominee to have anything to do with Wall Street “fat cats“ and view higher taxes on the wealthy and stronger banking regulations as sacrosanct positions for any potential nominee to hold.

After CNBC reported earlier this month on Gillibrand making calls to bankers to gauge potential support for a 2020 bid, the senator tweeted a list of her progressive credentials on the banking industry including support for a financial transactions tax, reinstating a wall between retail and investment banking and opposing the bank bailouts of 2008.

In several interviews, Wall Street executives cited these positions as reasons they were skeptical of Gillibrand as a candidate and unlikely to support her unless she catches fire and emerges from the field. “It will be an interesting test to see if people actually step up and support her,” one senior executive at a large bank said. “There is not a lot of trust there.”

But Gillibrand does have Wall Street backers who view her as pragmatic, a centrist and preferable to Warren or Sanders.

“She understands Wall Street, but she is not owned by Wall Street,” said Larry Rand, a Wall Street veteran and visiting professor of economics at Brown University. “Wall Street likes her because she is a pragmatist, not an ideologue, and of the announced candidates so far she is the most electable.”

A person close to Gillibrand noted the senator’s strong support for banking regulation and said any meetings with people at financial firms should not indicate a willingness to change positions on anything.

Overall in 2020, financial support from Wall Street and corporate America is likely to be somewhat less important. Democratic candidates are mostly swearing off any donations from corporate political action committees and are committed to raising small dollar amounts from grassroots donors, mostly online. Warren has urged all candidates to swear off support from any outside PACs and also criticized anyone who self-funds, a clear shot at Bloomberg.

Warren and Sanders both have formidable digital fundraising operations, as do Gillibrand and Harris. O’Rourke broke fundraising records last year in his unsuccessful Texas Senate run, drawing in $80 million.

But the allure of wealthy donors who can write the maximum $2,700 checks to candidates — and billionaires who can fund outside super PACs — will remain, especially given the competition for small dollar online donations and the pressure to put up solid fundraising numbers in early reporting periods to show momentum.

“People are still calling and showing up. They just don’t want to be seen doing it,” a senior Wall Street executive who has worked in Democratic politics said.

Pete Buttigieg, the Democratic mayor of South Bend, Ind., who just entered the presidential race running at least in part as a voice of fiscal prudence, said in an interview that he would not shy away from seeking Wall Street cash. “But I’m not sure they would be too wild about me anyway,” he said, noting that he too is focused on small dollar, grassroots donors.

While Bloomberg represents something of the platonic ideal on Wall Street — fiscally responsible while strong on climate change and gun policy and not in need of cash — Biden represents something of a wild card.

The former vice president does not have deep relationships across Wall Street, but he’s viewed favorably as a candidate who could win and would take a somewhat more moderate approach on taxes and regulation. But there are concerns about his age and his penchant for gaffes.

“Everybody likes him. I don’t know if you want him to be president at 78 in 2020, but it looks like he’s in great shape,” said one hedge fund manager and top Democratic donor. “If it’s Biden and Beto or Biden and Harris, that might make a difference. The good news for Biden is everyone likes him. The bad news is there is not a lot of passion.”

Among the most hardcore Democrats on Wall Street, the strong desire is to find a candidate — any candidate — who can beat Trump, even if that means getting behind someone like Warren who supports policies that bankers hate.

“Everybody just wants to win,” a second senior executive who has worked in Democratic politics at the presidential level said. “It’s as wide open as I’ve ever seen it. There is no gravitational force that everyone is sort of running towards. Everyone has their candidate. Frankly, if people believed Warren would win, they’d jump on board. And everyone in the top tier not named Bernie Sanders could probably win.”",www.politico.com,left,EPu3dUJ219tB9U3e

Turkey%27s stock market has fallen 29%25 the past three months

Out of 250 companies reporting fourth-quarter earnings%2C 172 have beaten estimates

Exit, stage right: Greed. Enter, stage left: Fear.

The financial markets have taken a look at 2014 and aren't liking what they're seeing. ""We're getting slapped around here a little bit,"" says Andrew Brooks, vice president and head of U.S. equity trading at Baltimore-based T. Rowe Price. ""The world is a little nervous.""

And how. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 326.05 points Monday, a 2.1% decline, bringing its 2014 loss to 7.3%.

Making the world nervous all year: jittery emerging markets. Turkey's stock market has plunged 13.3% in U.S. dollar terms this year and 29% the past three months, according to MSCI. Russia and South Africa's markets have both fallen more than 10% this year.

STOCKS MONDAY:Indexes lose 2% or more

Investors aren't worried because they think Turkish and Russian investors will be selling their U.S. stocks. But stock investors do worry that growth in the emerging markets will slow, and that could hurt earnings for multinational consumer companies such as Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble, which have gotten much of their growth from emerging markets.

Many investors recall the emerging meltdown of 1998, which shaved nearly 20% from the Dow in a few short weeks, as emerging markets saw their interest rates soar and their economies crumble.

And, of course, there's always more to worry about:

• The Federal Reserve. The Fed has been easing back on the monetary throttle, which had been open pretty much as wide as it could go. For much of last year, the Fed bought $85 billion a month in mortgage-backed securities and Treasuries in a bid to reduce long-term interest rates, particularly mortgage rates. Since December, however, the Fed has been slowing down its purchases by $10 billion a month, and some investors fear that the market might crumble without the Fed's market-friendly bond-buying program.

• Congress. The U.S. will hit its debt ceiling limit at the end of February, making the federal government unable to pay the bills that Congress has already authorized. If Congress doesn't agree to raise the debt ceiling, the nation could default on its debt. The last time Congress came close to default, Standard & Poor's downgraded the nation's credit rating, and the Dow fell 634.76 in a single day.

• Manufacturing. The Institute of Supply Management's factory index fell to 51.3, lower than most forecasts. Although a reading above 50 indicates that the manufacturing industry is growing, Monday's report was a surprise to most market participants.

Is all this fear warranted? Not really. ""It doesn't feel good, but it's not uncommon for the market to consolidate and pull back after a year like 2013,"" Brooks says.

There are reasons to be cheerful, says Rich Weiss, senior portfolio manager at American Century. ""Earnings are showing up pretty well,"" he says. According to S&P Capital IQ, 250 companies have reported earnings for the fourth quarter of 2014, and of those, 172 have beaten analyst estimates. Analysts expect fourth-quarter S&P 500 earnings growth to gain 7.3% year over year.

Forecasts have been problematic, though, coming in somewhat more negative than expected. ""Guidance has been conservative,"" S&P's Brooks says. But companies that produce aggressively optimistic guidance get punished hard by the market when they disappoint.

Finally, bad news isn't bad news for all types of investments: 10-year Treasury yields have plunged on waves of pessimism, to 2.58% Monday from 3.03% at the end of 2013.

Stocks rose Wednesday as tech rallied and surging oil pushed energy shares higher. The dollar fell and Treasuries clawed back from an early retreat amid speculation the Federal Reserve may soften its stance on raising interest rates.

Most major U.S. equity benchmarks were up in light pre-Thanksgiving trading, although they gave back some ground in the afternoon to finish near session lows, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending flat. The small-capitalization Russell 2000 Index climbed 1.3 percent to pace the gains, and the Nasdaq 100 Index wiped out nearly half of its decline from Tuesday.

Energy was the strongest group in the S&P 500 Index, as WTI crude rebounded from a one-year low to leap back above $54 a barrel. Apple Inc. surrendered an earlier gain to close down for a third straight day, bringing its loss this week to 8.6 percent.

“The FANGs were doing all the heavy lifting for the indexes, and now that that’s come unwound somewhat,” said Craig Brothers, head of fixed income at Bel Air Investment Advisors. “Tech had an oversize effect on the rally and an oversize effect on the selloff because it’s such a big portion of the indexes.”

Here are some of the equity moves:

Foot Locker Inc. jumped 15 percent, the most since May, after posting strong third-quarter earnings.

amid speculation of a coming merger with Viacom Inc., which also saw its stock climb. Gap Inc. added almost 5 percent despite reporting weak earnings as investors appeared to finally buy the dip on a company that had lost almost 10 percent this month.

The dollar weakened after MNI reported the Fed is considering ending a cycle of interest rate hikes as early as the spring. In addition, U.S. data showed that durable goods orders declined and filings for unemployment benefits rose.

“The market is really trading on technicals, a lot of the tech names are very overvalued,” Rahul Shah, chief executive officer of Ideal Asset Management. “For a name like Apple, you could argue that some buyers are coming in at this level. But overall, today’s action might be an oversold bounce. I wouldn’t read it as a shift in the tenor of the market.”

Banks and telecommunications companies led an advance in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index as optimism for a compromise on Italy’s budget buoyed stocks. The euro gained and Italian bonds firmed on reports the Italian government may be open to budget revisions as the European Union took a first step toward imposing fines on the country.

Apple’s plunge Tuesday hit suppliers in Asia, sending the leading benchmark tracking Asia-Pacific stocks lower. Oil . Investors are weighing industry data that showed U.S. crude inventories unexpectedly fell last week against doubts about OPEC’s plans to cut output.

Investor sentiment remains susceptible to the volatility that’s rocked markets since October. Traders are having to contend with the Trump Administration’s trade war, as well as the president’s calls on the Federal Reserve to back off from raising rates as corporate credit spreads at two-year highs reflect investor angst about borrowing costs.

“There are still concerns, particularly over China and the path of the Fed and that will likely continue,” said Jennifer Ellison, principal at San-Francisco based BOS, which manages $4.5 billion. “It’s part of the volatility we’re in.”

Elsewhere, emerging-market shares climbed, and an index tracking developing-nation currencies reached the highest since August. Bitcoin advanced after a recent sell-off.

Republican hard-liners predicted Tuesday they have the votes to stop a reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank — a government agency that has come under fire from conservatives who argue it amounts to a free market-distorting handout — over the protest of powerful Republican business interests . The bank ’ s charter is set to expire at the end of June .
“ I believe the momentum is in our favor , ” said House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling ( R-Texas ) . “ I think every day that the facts are out about the corruption , the cronyism , the political lending , the ideological lending of this bank , more and more members of the House Republican Conference are saying , ‘ You know what ? I don ’ t want to be a part of that. ’ And so I ’ m optimistic that hopefully we can be victorious . ”
The emphatic statements of Hensarling and other House conservatives set the stage for yet another potential showdown between Boehner , an Ohio Republican , and his right flank . Democrats want to reauthorize the bank and say it would pass if the speaker allowed a vote , but that would mean defying the wishes of a majority of the GOP conference .
Hensarling , along with Republican Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio , Raúl Labrador of Idaho and Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina , said enough of the 245-member Republican delegation are opposed to preserving the bank that House Republican leaders should let the agency die on June 30 .
Still , there are deep divisions within the GOP over the bank . Boehner has said letting the bank ’ s authorization expire could kill thousands of jobs , and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business groups are pushing aggressively to extend its charter .
But nearly the entire GOP presidential field believes the bank should be dissolved — and opponents in the House have seen their ranks swell for weeks . Powerful senators like Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) are also pushing to eliminate the bank .
“ This is going to be a critical vote , or hopefully a nonvote , on the future of the Republican Party and the future of our economy , ” Hensarling said .
The looming deadline for the bank , which provides loans to help American businesses that export products , will ramp up pressure on pro-Ex-Im Republicans and Democrats to forge a deal that can garner 217 votes . In the Senate , members of both parties hope to attach a reauthorization of the bank to trade legislation that the Senate hopes to finish by the end of this week .
Boehner has said publicly that he will follow Hensarling ’ s lead on whether to renew the Ex-Im Bank charter or allow it to end . But the speaker has also warned that thousands of workers could lose their jobs if the bank ceases operations . And he has told Hensarling that if the Senate passes an Ex-Im reauthorization plan , the House may be forced to put it on the floor .
“ Listen , I support any plan that the chairman can get through his committee , ” Boehner said late last month . “ Whether it would reform the bank , wind it down — but there are thousands of jobs on the line that would disappear pretty quickly if the Ex-Im Bank were to disappear . So I told the chairman he needs to come up with a plan because the risk is , if he does nothing , the Senate is likely to act , and then what ? ”
If Boehner moves to renew the bank , he would be opposing nearly his entire GOP leadership team , as well as Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan ( R-Wis. ) and the bulk of hard-line House conservatives .
And it would once again mean Boehner would be forced to rely on Democrats to pass controversial legislation over the loud objections of his conference . Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland told reporters on Tuesday that it would be simple to extend the bank ’ s charter before June 30 if Boehner has the confidence to allow a vote .
“ Put it on the floor , it ’ ll pass , ” Hoyer said . “ It has the majority of the votes on the floor of the House of Representatives . The speaker said he ’ s for it and wants to see it passed. ” Hoyer predicted 235 to 245 lawmakers would support that bill — a number that includes the vast majority of the Democratic Caucus and the 60 Republicans who have signed on to a reauthorization bill authored by Tennessee Republican Rep. Stephen Fincher .
Such a move , however , would cause major problems for Boehner with his right flank . The reauthorization of the bank has become a focal point for the House Freedom Caucus , the 30-member group of conservatives that attempts to push GOP leadership rightward .
If Boehner circumvents conservatives on Ex-Im , he would face tough questions over his leadership and past promises to respect the will of the majority of the GOP conference .
“ He would have a lot of explaining to do , ” Mulvaney said . “ Why does John Boehner know better than all of our presidential candidates , the majority leader , Chairman Hensarling , Chairman Ryan , Chairman [ Tom ] Price [ the Georgia Republican atop the Budget Committee ] ? If John ’ s attitude is that he is the only adult in the room , why are those people children ? ”
Conservatives have attacked the bank for “ crony capitalism. ” They argue that the bank picks economic winners and losers by giving loans to corporations like Boeing and General Motors — and runs counter to the small-government principles the hard-line Republicans were elected on .
“ This is a fundamental position our party has , ” Jordan said . “ We ’ re the party of not cronyism , not cozy relationships , not connected corporations getting special deals . We ’ re the party of free markets . For the Senate to try and tie it onto something else , that is a huge problem , and our side will look at every option we have to try and stop that . ”
Supporters argue that the bank helps U.S. companies compete abroad as most developed nations offer subsidies to corporations that export national goods . Democrats also argue that the bank gives loans to small businesses to help them get footing into foreign markets .
At a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee hearing on Tuesday , lawmakers from both parties said without the Ex-Im bank , their districts could experience major job losses .
“ As we continue to debate reauthorization , I hope we can focus on the fact of jobs and the more than 60 competing international export credit agencies that undercut and destroy American jobs daily , ” GOP Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina said . “ In a perfect world , the Export-Import Bank would not be needed , but , unfortunately … we do not live in a perfect world . ”","House conservatives are declaring victory in their yearslong quest to kill an obscure government bank — and Speaker John Boehner may soon face a choice whether to team up with Democrats to save it.

Amid growing concerns over racial inequality in the criminal justice system , “ civil asset forfeiture ” is facing renewed scrutiny .
On June 25 , Sens . Rand Paul , Angus King , Mike Crapo , and Mike Lee reintroduced their bill , the “ Fifth Amendment Integrity Restoration Act , ” to limit civil asset forfeiture and restore due process rights .
Through civil asset forfeiture , federal and state-level law enforcement can seize private property they merely suspect is related to some criminal activity . Examples of seized property include cash , vehicles , and even homes . No charges or convictions are required for police to confiscate this property . ( Alternatively , in the less-common process of criminal asset forfeiture , a conviction is required . ) In an inversion of the principle of “ innocent until proven guilty , ” Americans must pursue a lengthy , complicated , and costly appeal process to get their property back .
According to the public interest law firm the Institute for Justice ( IJ ) , the Department of Justice takes in roughly $ 4.5 billion annually from civil asset forfeiture . And it happens at the state level in most of the country as well . Texas , for example , took in $ 50 million in 2017 through criminal and civil asset forfeiture combined . IJ examined the fairness of civil asset forfeiture laws to grade all 50 states and gave 35 a “ D+ ” or worse .
Why are law enforcement agencies so aggressive with the practice ? Critics describe it as “ policing for profit . ”
Per the Institute for Justice , “ In 43 states , police and prosecutors can keep anywhere from half to all of the proceeds they take in from civil forfeiture. ” The assets go into their own department ’ s coffers , not back into the general treasury .

In 2015 , Kinloch fought off a burglar who tried to break into his apartment . When he called the police , officers found a small amount of marijuana in the apartment and , without any evidence of a connection , seized $ 1,800 in cash they found in the home .
Drug charges were filed against Kinloch but later dropped , and he was never convicted of any crime . Police kept the cash .
In another example , a taco truck driver had $ 10,000 seized by the Los Angeles Sheriff ’ s Department even though he was never arrested or charged with a crime . He was never able to recover the funds .
And as the Pittsburgh Post Gazette reports , police confiscated $ 15,000 that Colombian immigrant Miladis Salgado was saving for her granddaughter ’ s quinceañera . Their only basis ?

There ’ s reason to believe that civil asset forfeiture disproportionately affects racial minorities . As part of their two-year investigation into asset forfeiture , the Greenville News found that in South Carolina , “ Seven out of 10 people who have property taken are black , and 65 percent of all money police seize is from black males. ” The newspaper ’ s investigation only applies to one state , but academic studies have found that the racial diversity of a municipality positively correlates with the amount of property seized by law enforcement .
This perceived injustice is motivating Paul and Lee ’ s renewed legislative push to reform civil asset forfeiture .
“ The federal government has made it far too easy for government agencies to take and profit from the property of those who have not been convicted of a crime , ” Paul said in a statement .
“ While we certainly want to ensure that law enforcement has the tools they need to fight crime , the federal government should not be wrongfully taking our citizens ’ private property and denying them due process under the law , ” Lee added .
One key reform included in the bill is the elimination of something known as “ equitable sharing , ” where local law enforcement can circumvent state laws limiting forfeiture and turn proceeds over to the federal government for a cut of the profits . So , too , the senators ’ bill eliminates the profit incentive driving much of this seizure by mandating that federal forfeiture proceeds are deposited in the general Treasury fund , not the DoJ ’ s personal piggy bank .

The New York Times says Trump has a “small personal stake” in Sanofi, the French drug manufacturer that produces the drug.

The report doesn’t say how small, but it notes that his three family trusts have investments in a Dodge & Cox mutual fund whose largest holding is Sanofi. A fund that matches this description is the Dodge & Cox International Stock Fund DODFX, +2.11% , which at last check was 3.3% invested in Sanofi.

Trump’s 2019 financial-disclosure form lists stakes in Family Trusts 1, 2 and 3 valued at between $1,001 and $15,000. So if Trump has the maximum $15,000 in each of the trusts, he holds a stake in Sanofi that’s worth $1,485 — and, at the minimum, just $99.

It turns out he does look to have more than that modest sum invested in Sanofi, because, unmentioned in the Times report, his trusts also hold broader European stock-market index funds.

The iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF IEFA, +2.18% has 0.67% of its holdings in Sanofi, and Sanofi is a 0.78% holding for the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF EFA, +2.26% , which is neither surprising nor notable, in that the French drug maker is so large.

And Trump has a small stake in basically every big company you can think of.

But trouble in China isn’t synonymous with a threat of global recession.



In fact, plenty of voices spoke up with a message of calm on Monday. Today’s situation contains genuine uncertainty about the pace of global economic growth. It’s not clear how bad China’s economic turmoil will get or how strong the impacts on the world economy will be. But to many forecasters, the visible risks today aren’t of the global-recession kind of magnitude.

In the end, Monday’s downdraft didn’t end up as severe as the opening moments suggested.



The Dow still posted a hefty 3.6 percent decline – down some 588 points for the day, to close at 15,871.35. Losses in the broader Standard & Poor’s 500 index came even closer to a 4 percent decline for the day. And Monday’s selloff came after the Dow lost 1,000 points over the previous five days.



Outside the US, declines in Europe, Japan, and Hong Kong were on the order of 5 percent. Behind it all was an 8.5 percent plunge on China’s benchmark stock index that prompted a “Black Monday” label in Shanghai news reports.



For shaken investors outside China, though, analysts say it can be helpful to keep Monday's swoon in perspective. They cite several factors, chief among which is a US domestic economy that is still demonstrating some forward momentum.

The United States implemented dramatic new restrictions on Americans going out in public and 7 million people in the San Francisco area were put on a near-total lockdown to control the coronavirus emergency that has walloped the global economy.

Not everyone was adhering to the clampdowns, however.

On the same day that the Trump administration called on Americans to not gather in groups of more than 10 people and urged older people to stay home, Arizona, Florida and Illinois went ahead with plans to hold presidential primaries Tuesday. Ohio called off its primary just hours before polls were to open.

Beaches on Florida’s Gulf coast near Tampa stayed open, including one that was was flooded with spring breakers. Gov. Ron Desantis said he would leave it up to communities whether to restrict access to beaches.

“It’s not probably advisable to have spring break gatherings” but that people in small groups at the beach is probably OK, he said. “I think the communities can work that out.”

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, praised the federal government’s response as he took only limited action amid the outbreak. Unlike other governors of heavily populated states, Abbott has not made explicit calls for limiting mass gatherings.

“This is not a time to panic,” he said. “It’s not as if we have never been through this before. We’ve been through this many, many times.”

The comments came on the same day that the number of infections in the U.S. climbed to nearly 4,500, with at least 81 deaths, two-thirds of them in hard-hit Washington state. Worldwide, more than 7,100 have died.

With the U.S. economy shuddering to a near-halt, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted nearly 3,000 points, or 13%, its biggest one-day percentage loss since the Black Monday crash of 1987.

The rapid work stoppage had Americans fretting about their jobs and their savings, threatened to overwhelm unemployment benefit programs, and heightened fears the country could plunge into a recession.

The decision to move ahead with primaries ran counter to stern new guidelines put in place by the Trump administration.

Over the next half month, Americans should not gather in groups of more than 10 people, schooling should be at home and discretionary travel and social visits should be avoided.

The president for the first time acknowledged that the pandemic may send the economy into a recession and suggested that the nation may be dealing with the virus until “July or August.”

Elections officials in Arizona, Florida and Illinois said they were taking precautions to make sure voters could safely cast their ballots, despite widening calls for people to avoid going in public. A handful of other states already postponed their elections.

Chicago elections officials worked late Monday to find replacements for 168 polling sites.

And the city elections commission was begging healthy people to volunteer to work at the polls amid a “tsumani” of cancellations.

“Please, please heed our call and volunteer,” said Marisel Hernandez, the commission’s chair. “Help us.”

Meanwhile, millions of Americans were holed up at home, with many thrown out of work until further notice as the list of businesses forced to close across the U.S. extended to restaurants, bars, gyms and casinos.

The shutdowns touched every corner of the country: blackjack dealers in Las Vegas, theme park workers in Orlando, Florida, restaurant and bar employees nationwide, and winery workers in California. At least eight states called on all bars and restaurants to close at least part of the day.

The economy appears to be decelerating at a much faster pace than during the 2008 financial meltdown.

“This is like an avalanche. It’s all happening at once,” said Heidi Shierholz, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. “And no one knows how long it’s going to last.”

On the other side of the ledger, Amazon announced it wants to add 100,000 workers to deliver packages amid a surge in online orders from people unable or unwilling to set foot in stores. And gun sales soared in many places as fear took hold.

“I’ve never seen it like this,” said Ed Turner, who owns Ed’s Public Safety in Stockbridge, Georgia. “This is self-preservation. This is panic. This is ‘I won’t be able to protect my family from the hordes and the walking dead.’”

With schools closed for tens of millions of children across the country, parents began using lesson plans that included flash cards, online learning, dog walks and creativity sessions. Many did this while juggling work conference calls, emails and memos. Others scrambled to find child care.

Nationwide, many restaurants were restricted to takeout or delivery only.

It started with animal spirits left for dead by the financial crisis. It’s set to finish with stocks near records, volatility vanquished and the credit supercycle on steroids.

This is the tale of global markets over a decade of “fire and ice.”

In the 2010s traders braved everything from the sovereign meltdown in Europe and populist rage to “ Volmageddon” and the shale revolution. Political earthquakes, shaky corporate earnings and credit shocks all came for the bull market. Central banks saved the day.

Meanwhile, Donald Trump began the era as a reality TV star and will finish it as president and Tariff Man, with his America First agenda whipsawing billions of dollars in investment flows around the world. It all leaves investors dodging political bombs, recession fears and disappearing yields even as they close out the decade with some of best gains in a generation.

Seeking clues on what lies ahead, Bloomberg reporters chronicle here how the past 10 years has transformed the major asset classes.

Bonds: Return-Free Risk

From risk-free return to return-free risk: The world of fixed income got turned upside down as bears went into extinction and every sell-off proved little more than a head-fake.

At its peak a record $17 trillion stockpile of negative-yielding securities roiled global markets in 2019 -- spurring capital gains for holders while saddling the likes of pension funds with loss-making investments down the road.

Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields are a shadow of their former selves, with those in Germany and Japan at epic lows. Thank demographics, growth angst, vanishing inflation, or monetary interventions. Whatever your worldview, the takeaway is the same: Interest rates failed to wake up from the crisis slumber.

“These yields echo that the ghost of the Great Recession is still continuing to circulate through global capital markets,” said Jack Malvey, a debt veteran and former chief global fixed-income strategist at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. “With little room left for return in bonds, the big question for the 2020s is when does the mean reversion come?”

The Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Treasuries index has returned some 5% in 2019 alone through late December. It’s gained more than 19% since the start of 2010. Today coupons are paltry, if they exist at all. Further price gains look unlikely given the fierce starting point for valuations at the close of 2019.

Yet the risks couldn’t be greater. Duration, a gauge of how much prices decline as yields rise, is near record levels while outstanding stock has exploded by trillions of dollars.

Key takeaways Yields tumbled to multi- decade lows

Portfolios laced with near record rate risk

FX: King Dollar

The biggest danger in global finance this decade landed with the euro-area crisis, which threatened to wipe out the most ambitious currency project in history.

High levels of government debt, soaring bond yields and a collapse in confidence pushed nations in Europe’s periphery to the brink of bankruptcy. Greek yields soared past 40% at one point in 2012 while those on Italian, Portuguese and Spanish securities also surged.

It took a massive restructuring package and the famous “whatever it takes” declaration from then European Central Bank President Mario Draghi to stave off disaster. But big institutional frailties remain, like the conspicuous lack of a fiscal framework and full banking union. With high debt levels across much of the region and interest rates already at historic lows, the threat of another crisis remains very real.

By contrast the dollar’s status as the world’s premier reserve currency looks as strong as ever, defying post-crisis fears that the center of monetary gravity would shift from America to China. The greenback accounts for some 60% of global foreign exchange reserves, around the same as late 2009 though below 2015 levels.

That’s little solace for traders who rely on price swings to make money. While the global currency market has grown by more than a third to $6.6 trillion since 2010, volatility has plummeted as central banks dance to a dovish beat in concert.

“It was pretty much a decade of fire and ice,” said Ned Rumpeltin, European head of foreign-exchange strategy at Toronto Dominion Bank. “We spent so much of the last 10 years lurching from crisis to crisis, but those episodes were interspersed with long periods of low vol.”

There were flare-ups: Flash crashes hit currencies including the British pound and the South African rand, prompting the Bank for International Settlements to warn of danger ahead when volatility roars back to life.

And that’s not the only hurdle the market will have to clear, as automation comes for Wall Street jobs and newfangled technologies like blockchain challenge the established order.

Key takeaways King dollar reigns supreme

Day-to-day volatility is dying

Automation risks Wall Street jobs

Stocks: Unstoppable Bull

Events like the 2015 yuan devaluation and the 2018 risk rout gave stock bulls a scare, but in the first decade to dodge a U.S. recession since records began it wasn’t enough to break them.

“People can overreact to some of that news flow, which would undermine their ability to capture what’s been a clearly very strong 10-year growth cycle,” said Luke Barrs, EMEA head of fundamental equity client portfolio management at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.

American stocks were ground zero for animal spirits, trouncing developed-market competitors. Adjusted for volatility risk, gains in the S&P 500 index since Dec. 31, 2009 look poised to be the highest of any decade since at least the 1950s.

In dollar terms the Stoxx Europe 600 has posted only a third of the S&P 500’s total returns of more than 250% this decade. The region’s large exposure to beleaguered value shares, political risk from Brexit to Italian populism, and the absence of hot tech companies all played a role. Europe has suffered the biggest outflows among major markets, losing about $100 billion this year alone.

Famously, public equity markets have been shrinking this decade thanks to corporate buybacks, private equity funds taking companies off the market and initial public offerings dwindling. Volumes have also been falling as a result.

Meanwhile a number of leading Democratic candidates for the 2020 U.S. election are proposing higher corporate taxes, further threatening equity returns in the years ahead.

Key takeaways Bears crushed as U.S. stocks made history

Europe hit by outflows

Credit: Leverage Monster

Global corporate debt has nearly doubled this past decade, defying the oil-price crash and memories of the credit crisis. It became a seller’s market like never before: Negative-yielding corporate bonds surpassed $1 trillion in 2019, companies sold longer-duration debt and issuers dispensed with clauses to protect investors.

Corporate bond buyers today are getting vanishing premiums, close to record interest-rate risk and hefty leverage to boot. Anyone investing $100 in U.S. junk bonds on the last day of 2009, however, is sitting on more than double the amount. Europe has produced similar returns.

“It didn’t matter what you owned, everything went up because central banks were buying,” said Jonathan Gregory, a money manager at UBS Asset Management in London. “Who knows what the right price is when you have a buyer like that?”

At the same time the quality of the market has deteriorated. In the past decade, the stock of U.S. bonds rated BBB, the lowest rung of investment grade, has tripled to $3 trillion. If history repeats, a huge swath of credit could fall to junk in a recession.

Crude: Awakening

Oil may have spent the first half of the decade dancing around $100 a barrel, but the crash in 2014 told the story that would define global commodity markets for years to come: The shale revolution is here to stay.

“The U.S. has disrupted the industry in a way that was never expected,” said Abhishek Deshpande, head of oil market research at JPMorgan Chase & Co.

American supply has bestowed the market with a game-changing buffer in the face of civil wars, terrorist attacks and military conquests.

A drone strike in September shut down half of Saudi Arabia’s production in the single biggest disruption in the oil market’s history, yet investor reaction was largely sanguine after the initial shock. Lost barrels were offset by inventories.



Citigroup Inc. recently pegged geopolitical risk at its highest in 15 years while WTI prices for 2019 are set for their fourth-lowest average of the decade.

Looming over the market is China’s easing appetite for commodities to feed its export-led economic model. Double-digit oil demand growth has occurred almost half as many times this decade as in the previous one.

There are also bigger threats to the commodity complex as the green lobby and the Paris agreement shape market sentiment, from speculation in the futures market to capital expenditure by oil companies.

Key takeaways Days of $100 crude are over

Shale changed everything

Big Oil is becoming Big Energy

Emerging Markets: Alpha Male

What unites Argentina, India, Ivory Coast, Pakistan, Philippines and Saudi Arabia? At first blush, very little. It takes India hardly any time to produce the full-year gross domestic product of Ivory Coast. The sky-high inflation rates of Argentina contrast with negative price-growth in Saudi Arabia. Pakistan has never enjoyed the leadership continuity common among peers.

Yet global investors have made billions over the past decade casting these markets in a similar vein in a key respect: They are in effect one-man shows.

Think Narendra Modi of India, Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, Vladimir Putin of Russia. These men and others helped set the terms for the asset class in the 2010s.

Despite progress made this decade to beef up fiscal, trade and currency regimes, developing economies remain acutely prone to capital volatility, social unrest, and inflation flare-ups. A year’s gains can be wiped out in a week. A stable leader can make all the difference in pushing through reforms and maintaining order, rewarding investors with triple-digit returns along the way.

So-called key man dependence is not without huge risks given the endless political games -- a threat looming over markets of all stripes in the 2020s.

An Oval Office address about the pandemic by President Donald Trump late Wednesday failed to alleviate market anxieties going in to trading on Thursday.

Reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act has achieved something close to totemic significance in the Democratic Party. It's the 1933 law that forbade financial companies from engaging in both commercial and investment banking. It was scrapped in 1999 by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which was passed by a conservative Congress and signed by Democratic President Bill Clinton. And at Tuesday night's debate between the party's presidential hopefuls, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley went hard on the idea that resurrecting Glass-Steagall's firewall is central to preventing a repeat of the Great Recession — and he knocked Hillary Clinton for not sharing his enthusiasm.

It's worth pondering, because concentrating on Glass-Steagall tells a particular story about how the financial crisis happened. That story implies certain things we should do, and certain things we should learn.

In this case, the story O'Malley is telling isn't quite right. And Clinton's financial reform plan, while not as sound-bite friendly, tells a better one.

The story of the Great Recession begins with the housing bubble, and the mortgage-backed security (MBS). A form of financial engineering that sliced and diced mortgages into incredibly complex cash flows that were then sold off to investors, MBSs first became widespread in the late 1990s. Regulators and ratings agencies proved woefully inadequate to the challenge of assessing their risk, so MBSs allowed a massive wave of doomed mortgages to flood the financial system under the guise of ultra-secure investments.

Meanwhile, the rise of developing countries across the world meant the global economy was awash in new cash looking for a safe place to land. The United States was recovering from the tech bubble, and investing in housing was an attractive way to make money — which then drove consumption throughout the economy, which then circled back around to more investment in housing and ever-higher prices. Another important factor was probably the rise of inequality: As sustainable economic security got further out of reach for more Americans, a ride on the booming housing market became an attractive (if unsustainable) way to close the gap. This all drove the demand for MBSs through the roof.

The companies that put MBSs together were also rarely the ones that held on to them. Instead, they were sold off to other financial institutions and proliferated through the system. The incentive was to maximize volume and minimize care.

Then there was the credit default swap (CDS) — yet another bit of financial engineering that hit in the late 1990s. These were bets financial companies could make to offset the risk of MBSs. That made the mortgage-backed instruments even more attractive, and spread the linkages even further throughout the system.

Put it all together, and the financial industry had a massive incentive to prey on everyday Americans with bad mortgages, and both the motive and the means to flood the entire financial system with those toxic assets. (Keep in mind none of this requires government tinkering or intervention.) But if you were focused on the distinction between commercial and investment banking, which is what Glass-Steagall had reinforced, you wouldn't have predicted how the crisis played out at all.

Citigroup and Bank of America were both major banks that took advantage of Glass-Steagall's repeal to get into both commercial and investment banking. And they did require big bailouts. But as Neil Irwin pointed out, Bear Sterns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley were all solely investment banks, and AIG was just dealing in insurance. (Along with three others, AIG is a nonbank financial company now listed by the Financial Stability Oversight Council as a systemic risk.) The combined MBS-CDS rot spread across every species of bank and nonbank in the financial system, connecting them all through a marketplace known as the ""shadow banking"" sector.

Clinton clearly gets this. ""We also have to worry about some of the other players — AIG, a big insurance company; Lehman Brothers, an investment bank,"" she said in the debate. ""There's this whole area called 'shadow banking.' That's where the experts tell me the next potential problem could come from.""

Now, while the repeal of Glass-Steagall was not central to all this, another law, passed by all the same bipartisan players in late 2000, arguably was: the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, which exempted both derivatives (the category under which MBSs fall) and CDSs from regulation by both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trade Commission. Alan Greenspan, chair of the Federal Reserve at the time, also famously refused to step into the subprime housing market with the Fed's regulatory powers. And other laws also helped speed along the process.

So while Glass-Steagall's fans may be wrong about their favored piece of law, their instincts about the deregulatory mania of the period is right on. And during the 2000s, it was effectively the Wild West.

This does not mean that, had either or both agencies been able to step in and regulate these financial instruments, they could have stopped the housing bubble. They probably couldn't have. But the unencumbered spread of the MBS-CDS web is what transformed the housing bubble from ""very painful"" to ""potentially world-ending."" And that could've been curtailed.

This story should also make it clear that financial reform is an all-hands-on-deck affair. We need to bring the entire financial system — banks, nonbanks, shadow banks, all of them — under consistent regulatory scrutiny. We need to enforce transparency, ensure there are financial buffers, provide a way to unwind collapsing institutions safely, and protect everyday consumers from predation. The 2010 Dodd-Frank law, to its credit, got the ball rolling on all of this, though it doesn't go far enough in winding down the size of the biggest and most systemically dangerous companies. At the end of the day, the smaller the company is, the less of a threat its collapse would pose.

Clinton's proposals not only double down on Dodd-Frank's strengths, they also address its weaknesses: strengthening capital requirements for financial institutions, and imposing an escalating system of fees on players that pass a certain size.

banking_and_finance,Salon,0,http://www.salon.com/2014/10/09/exclusive_bank_of_americas_horrid_customer_service_scandal/,EXCLUSIVE: Bank of America’s horrid “customer service” scandal,2014-10-09,Sarah Jaffe,"Tony ( last name not included for fear of reprisal on the job ) has worked at Bank of America for 11 years as a customer service associate . He takes phone calls from customers whose needs range from a simple change of address to a family crisis that leaves the caller unable to pay their bills , and he tries to help them solve their problems . And Tony and his coworkers are organizing .
Bank of America has had more complaints filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau than any other American financial institution , according to a July report from Mother Jones magazine . And according to Tony , many of those complaints could be fixed with better training for workers , who instead feel squeezed , wanting to provide good service to the customers they talk to daily and on the other hand scapegoated when something goes wrong . Tired of the inadequate training they receive , tired of watching associates get fired for mistakes they did n't know were mistakes , tired of feeling like they 're hurting customers rather than helping them , a group of around 40 workers got together to try to make , in Tony 's words , a positive change .
“ We started the group because we were tired of seeing good people walked out , ” Tony says . “ It 's tough when you 've got to work in an environment where they tap you on the shoulder , say 'Can you come to a meeting ? ' and as you walk away , another manager walks up to your desk with a box and starts packing your stuff . If you look over your shoulder , you see them packing your stuff as you walk away . And we all sit there in shock saying 'What did they do ? ' ”
He continues , “ When we 're not trained properly it 's hurting the customer , it 's hurting us . What 's sad is that , when we 're not trained properly our mistakes tend to favor the bank , when we 're trained properly we do n't favor the bank . Some people feel that the bank would rather us not be trained because the money they make off of that is in their favor . ”
For example , he says , associates received just a brief training on doing balance transfers in the computer system that they use to manage customers ' accounts . For a while , he was n't aware that at the end of the call , a disclosure statement would pop up that was to be read to the customer , a legal statement of how the interest would accrue and what the fee would be for the transfer . Instead , he says , they were told that they should never end a call until the customer is finished , so if the customer ended the call , the next call would come in without the disclosure ever appearing . One of his coworkers , he says , was fired when the quality control department , which listens to two recorded calls from each worker each month to make sure they 're doing their jobs correctly , caught her not reading the disclosure . “ This disclosure where the customer can say ' I do n't want a 4 % fee , ' this favors the bank when we do n't read it to them , ” he says . “ You 've already got the balance transfer , we ca n't do anything about the fee . ”
Another person , he says , was fired for taking a hold off of a deposited check at the request of a manager . The managers , he notes , get the same training on the system as the associates , but often have even less time to pay attention to them .
Tony worries that the computer-based trainings they do receive are inadequate . Instead of a class where they might be able to ask questions , he says , they get computer-based trainings that they are often pushed to rush through in less time than the training says it will take . Additionally , he says , “ The first thing it does is tell you 'here 's what the training is about , acknowledge you 've taken it and you know the subject matter . ' To get into the course to learn about the subject matter you have to click a button that says we know about the subject matter . After you take the course , if you do n't understand it , they go 'Well you learned about it , you clicked that button . ' There 's no way to take the course unless you acknowledge it . We feel that 's their way of saying it 's on you now . It 's not the bank , you acknowledged you know it , so you do it wrong , that 's your fault . ”
The training they do get , he says , is often about how to “ deepen the relationship , ” with the customer . “ Deepening the relationship is a nice word for selling you something , ” he says . Instead of upgrading a customer 's credit card , for instance , they are pushed to open a new card , one which might have a higher interest rate than their existing card . According to Chi Chi Wu , a staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center , this process could violate the Truth in Lending Act , which prohibits “ unsolicited issuance ” of a credit card .
“ Deepening the relationship ” means something different , perhaps , to Tony than it does to the bank higher-ups . He says , “ I once sat in a training was about selling more credit cards , how to 'deepen that relationship , ' using what the customer says as a tool to sell them this new credit card . One of the associates in the meeting says , 'This woman 's overdrawn , she 's told me she 's unemployed , I ca n't sell her a credit card , she ca n't afford to pay any of her bills now , that 's going to hurt her . ' The manager said 'How do you know she does n't need the credit card to buy milk or formula ? This could be just right at the right time . Sell her the credit card , it is n't our responsibility if she ca n't pay it . ' ”
“ That 's the kind of thinking that sunk this economy , ” Tony adds .
With the help of the Committee for Better Banks , a labor-community coalition that includes Alliance for a Greater New York ( ALIGN ) , Make the Road New York , New York Communities for Change ( NYCC ) and the Communications Workers of America union ( CWA ) , Tony 's group started a petition on Coworker.org this June . The petition calls for “ independent , federally-guided training be implemented immediately , for employees and managers alike . ”
Tony and his coworkers are not the first Bank of America employees to worry that they are being pushed to do wrong by their customers . As David Dayen reported for ███ in June of 2013 , former employees testified that they were denied training on mortgage procedures under federal programs , given bonuses for putting accounts into foreclosure , and pressed to lie to customers . Tony says , “ Maybe they 're like us , maybe certain things were left out because it favored the bank . As long as managers and site leaders are making their quotas , making their numbers , maybe that 's all they care about . ”
“ I look at Bank of America and like I said I 've worked there for years , I see them , they 're selling things off left and right , they 're selling branches in Michigan , they 're selling branches in Maine , we 're shrinking the bank , ” Tony continues . “ I wonder if they 're shrinking the bank to pay the bills and to make the bank look good ? Because it 's all about profit and money and we have to return to the shareholders . Do I think shareholders really care if the customers get burnt ? No , I really do n't . They 're more concerned with the return on their stock . Maybe if banks listened to their employees and listened to their customers , it would be much better world . ”
They began organizing with the idea of getting better at their jobs , being better able to serve their customers , and Tony says that though it 's slow , they are seeing some results . No one has acknowledged their petition , though he says he 's overhead remarks from higher-ups about their organizing , but after the workers took their yearly “ associate engagement survey , ” the Human Resources department sent someone to look into their complaints and one site leader was removed . This survey was given after about forty people had been let go for things that Tony says they 'd never have done if they were trained properly .
Once the workers began standing together to try to solve their problems , Tony says , there have been fewer firings and somewhat better communication , though information about practices still too often comes from other associates who have been reprimanded for doing something wrong and who share that information .
Tony hopes that if workers and customers stand up for each other , they can change the banking industry. “ Our customers are all our families , our friends , our communities , this country is in a dire situation because so many systems , of which banking is one , are failing them , because banking has become more about greed , ” he says . “ This is all of us together trying to make a better situation and until we all come together this is n't going to change . ”","Tony (last name not included for fear of reprisal on the job) has worked at Bank of America for 11 years as a customer service associate.

As David Dayen reported for Salon in June of 2013, former employees testified that they were denied training on mortgage procedures under federal programs, given bonuses for putting accounts into foreclosure, and pressed to lie to customers. Tony says, “Maybe they're like us, maybe certain things were left out because it favored the bank. As long as managers and site leaders are making their quotas, making their numbers, maybe that's all they care about.”

“I look at Bank of America and like I said I've worked there for years, I see them, they're selling things off left and right, they're selling branches in Michigan, they're selling branches in Maine, we're shrinking the bank,” Tony continues. “I wonder if they're shrinking the bank to pay the bills and to make the bank look good? Because it's all about profit and money and we have to return to the shareholders. Do I think shareholders really care if the customers get burnt? No, I really don't. They're more concerned with the return on their stock. Maybe if banks listened to their employees and listened to their customers, it would be much better world.”

They began organizing with the idea of getting better at their jobs, being better able to serve their customers, and Tony says that though it's slow, they are seeing some results. No one has acknowledged their petition, though he says he's overhead remarks from higher-ups about their organizing, but after the workers took their yearly “associate engagement survey,” the Human Resources department sent someone to look into their complaints and one site leader was removed. This survey was given after about forty people had been let go for things that Tony says they'd never have done if they were trained properly.

Once the workers began standing together to try to solve their problems, Tony says, there have been fewer firings and somewhat better communication, though information about practices still too often comes from other associates who have been reprimanded for doing something wrong and who share that information.

Tony hopes that if workers and customers stand up for each other, they can change the banking industry.“Our customers are all our families, our friends, our communities, this country is in a dire situation because so many systems, of which banking is one, are failing them, because banking has become more about greed,” he says. “This is all of us together trying to make a better situation and until we all come together this isn't going to change.”",www.salon.com,left,QkdR7Irhuh5FR7Ih

A fund Congress created to help rescue small businesses initially struggled to deliver relief to hurting firms. Now that it’s been replenished, the strict rules and confusing guidance surrounding the fund’s loans has stopped many recipient businesses from spending them, according to a new story from the New York Times.

For weeks, small businesses expressed outrage over the Paycheck Protection Program, which grants forgivable loans to businesses with fewer than 500 employees facing dire economic straits in a pandemic-induced depression. The initial $350 billion Congress set aside for the program—which covers two month’s worth of payroll, rent, and utility expenses—ran out in just two days as bigger, well-connected firms, such as Ruth’s Chris Steak House and Potbelly’s, hustled to secure large sums. Many larger businesses, such as Shake Shack and the Los Angeles Lakers, returned their loans amidst the backlash.

George Evageliou, who owns a woodworking company in Brooklyn, told the Times that the federal government made the program “so hard to use,” and that it’s “start[ing] to feel like a lose-lose situation.” Much of that stems from terms of the loan: It can be forgiven only if a firm hires back three-quarters of its employees and spends the whole sum within eight weeks of receiving it. With a sluggish economy with few signs of recovery and some states pushing their shelter-in-place orders into June, many employers suspect they’ll just have to lay off their employees again after the two months run out.

The Senate Banking Committee took its first look at spending under the massive CARES Act, which Congress approved in March to provide assistance to individuals, businesses and local governments affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were pressed by senators about their stewardship of specific aspects of the approximately $2 trillion relief package at Tuesday's remote hearing.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., criticized both the treasury secretary and the Fed for not including stronger requirements that businesses borrowing from the central bank keep workers on the payroll.

""We're in a situation where 35 million Americans have filed for unemployment,"" Warren said. ""You're in charge of half a trillion dollars. You're boosting your Wall Street buddies, and you are leaving Americans behind.""

Mnuchin disputed Warren's characterization and said the conditions attached to the Fed programs had been negotiated with Congress.

Powell reiterated his view that Congress may have to authorize additional spending to prevent long-term damage to the economy. ""What Congress has done to date has been remarkably timely and forceful,"" Powell said.

""I do think we need to take a step back and ask, over time, 'Is it enough?' And we need to be prepared to act further. And I would say we are if the need is there,"" Powell added.

Mnuchin, however, has been less open to new spending, saying federal lawmakers should wait to assess the effects of the four measures already approved by Congress before appropriating more funds.

The hearing came a day after a four-member panel appointed by Congress reported that none of the $46 billion allocated in the CARES Act for loans and loan guarantees for the airline industry has been spent and that relatively little of the $454 billion in program for loans to businesses and state and local governments has been disbursed by the Federal Reserve Board.

In his prepared testimony, Mnuchin appeared to dispute the oversight panel's findings. He says Treasury has ""committed up to $195 billion in credit support under the CARES Act. We have the remaining $259 billion to create or expand programs as needed, as we continue to monitor a variety of economic sectors closely."" He also says $25 billion in payroll support has been provided to the airline industry.

Powell said the Fed's Main Street lending facility for midsize businesses, municipal lending and other programs should be up and running by the end of May.

Democrats on the panel sent Powell and Mnuchin a letter Monday asking that they ""further expand loan eligibility requirements, including quickly adopting a viable option for non-profits who are facing acute challenges as a result of the virus,"" and provide greater flexibility on the loan terms.

Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., wrote that ""all taxpayers will be better off to the extent more businesses can access affordable financing, keeping doors open, workers on payroll, and avoiding costly bankruptcies, through the remainder of the public health shutdown.""

How much would each person get?

As of the latest proposal, individuals would receive up to $1,200 ($2,400 for joint returns) and no less than $600 ($1,200 for joint returns). Families would receive an additional $500 for each qualifying child.

Now, reeling financial markets see recession as the most likely outcome. Here are three signs the coronavirus outbreak could lead to a recession.

Oil prices plunge 25%

Most economies around the world are heavily dependent on oil, making the price of crude a good indicator for the state of the global economy. So the whopping 25% slump in oil prices this weekend to just under $35 a barrel — the lowest level in nearly five years — points to a downturn.

Back in 2015, oil prices scraped $30 a barrel, and the U.S. economy was still able to avoid a recession. This time, however, the worldwide spread of coronavirus has made the global economy much more fragile.

U.S. government bonds hit all-time lows

The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries fell to just below 0.5% early Monday. That is a full percentage point below the lowest they got in the aftermath of the financial crisis, which was 1.5% in mid-2012. It also is a new all-time low for bond yields, which until a week ago had never been below 1% for 10-year government debt.

The new low is not necessarily welcome news because government bond yields are a proxy for U.S. economic growth. A 0.5% bond yield suggests anemic, if not negative, growth.

Economic uncertainty amid coronavirus spread

Dan Suzuki, a portfolio strategist at Richard Bernstein, told Bloomberg, the biggest reason rates were so low was because they were predicting a global collapse in economic growth.

Bond yields move in the opposite direction of bond prices. The reason yields are falling is because investors are pilling into bonds. U.S. government debt is considered one of the safest investments around. So the rush into bonds to push yields to all-time lows suggests the current mood of investors is one of extreme fear.

U.S. stock market losses near $5 trillion

The market has tumbled 18% in the past week and a half, with companies listed on the S&P 500 losing just over $5 trillion of their value. That's another bad sign. Every U.S. recession has witnessed a 20% drop in stock market prices. We are quickly approaching that trouble zone.

The flip side: If we really are headed for a recession, then the stock market drop is nothing out of the ordinary. This slide just seems scarier than normal because of its speed. Such drops usually take awhile to materialize. But the coronavirus has taken the market by surprise.

Coronavirus outbreak takes toll on small business profits

The 500 stocks in the S&P 500 earned $165 a share last year. At the beginning of the year those earnings were expected to increase 10% to nearly $180 a share. The current drop for the S&P 500, while big, indicates that earnings are now expected to drop 10% this year. That's a recession, but only a mild one.

In a note to investors on Monday, Goldman Sachs' top U.S. equity strategist, David Kostin, said the firm's baseline assumption is that the coronavirus outbreak is widespread but short-lived.

Warren Buffett , whose eponymous rule was a staple of Obama ’ s 2012 reelection campaign , is underwriting Burger King ’ s proposed move to Canada that the left is denouncing as practically the most dastardly plot since the Rosenbergs helped the Soviets get the atomic bomb .
Burger King is acquiring the Canadian coffee and doughnuts chain Tim Hortons in what is called a “ corporate inversion. ” At least that ’ s the technical term for it . Obama and the left prefer to call it by names usually reserved for spies and AWOL soldiers before they get a last cigarette and a blindfold .
The practice of corporate inversion , or relocating overseas to avoid the burden of U.S. taxes , offends the president ’ s sense of “ economic patriotism , ” as he put it in a speech a few weeks ago . He referred to firms that make this move as “ corporate deserters ” taking advantage of an “ unpatriotic tax loophole . ”
Sen. Bernie Sanders , the socialist from Vermont , says companies like Burger King are betraying America ’ s veterans , and “ have absolutely no loyalty to the people of the United States and our government. ” Sen. Sherrod Brown , a Democrat from Ohio , has called for a boycott . Online petitions are targeting the chain for its rank abandonment of the United States .
This outpouring of patriotic fervor is something to behold , especially from the same sort of people who used to think expecting a politician to wear a flag lapel pin was a crudely nationalistic imposition .
The left almost universally scorns the idea that a closely held family business might have religious motivations — and was outraged by the Supreme Court ’ s Hobby Lobby decision for this reason — yet believes that enormous globe-bestriding corporations should have patriotic feelings .
Burger King is owned , by the way , by a Brazilian private equity firm . Its Brazilian patriotism should be in doubt , too , since it showed no sign of sinking into a months-long funk after Germany crushed Brazil in the World Cup semifinal .
In most other contexts , Obama is a proud “ citizen of the world . ”
Except when it come to taxing businesses . Then , he is transformed into the Giuseppe Garibaldi of American progressivism . For him , patriotism is the last refuge of the taxman .
It should give him and his allies pause that Canada — boring , socialistic Canada — is a tax haven compared to the United States . How did that happen ?
We now have a corporate tax system that combines the highest nominal rate in the developed world , at 35 percent , with loopholes that benefit special interests and the politically connected . Two Obama-appointed commissions have suggested major reform . On top of this , the U.S. — in a rarity for the developed world — imposes its tax rate on overseas earnings .
It is this latter factor that , as Matt Levine of Bloomberg View explains , was probably decisive . As he writes , the thought process is , “ If we ’ re incorporated in the U.S. , we ’ ll pay 35 percent taxes on our income in the U.S. and Canada and Mexico and Ireland and Bermuda and the Cayman Islands , but if we ’ re incorporated in Canada , we ’ ll pay 35 percent on our income in the U.S. but 15 percent in Canada and 30 percent in Mexico and 12.5 percent in Ireland and zero percent in Bermuda and zero percent in the Cayman Islands . ”
Burger King says it is making a purely business decision , and it is true that the merger makes sense on the merits outside of any tax considerations .
But Burger King could have made exactly the same business decision and kept its headquarters in Miami . For that matter , it could move its headquarters to New York City and pay higher taxes still , in an awe-inspiring act of patriotic commitment .
It is not that Burger King is “ shirking ” on taxes on its U.S. business through its move . It will have to pay U.S. rates on that regardless . It is avoiding paying the high U.S. taxes on its overseas business , and avoiding what would in effect be a tax increase for Tim Hortons by making it subject to the U.S. system .

Rich Lowry is editor of National Review.

It must have been a bitter moment for President Barack Obama when he got the news that his favorite economic guru not only doesn’t like paying taxes but hates America.

Warren Buffett, whose eponymous rule was a staple of Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign, is underwriting Burger King’s proposed move to Canada that the left is denouncing as practically the most dastardly plot since the Rosenbergs helped the Soviets get the atomic bomb.

Burger King is acquiring the Canadian coffee and doughnuts chain Tim Hortons in what is called a “corporate inversion.” At least that’s the technical term for it. Obama and the left prefer to call it by names usually reserved for spies and AWOL soldiers before they get a last cigarette and a blindfold.

The practice of corporate inversion, or relocating overseas to avoid the burden of U.S. taxes, offends the president’s sense of “economic patriotism,” as he put it in a speech a few weeks ago. He referred to firms that make this move as “corporate deserters” taking advantage of an “unpatriotic tax loophole.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders, the socialist from Vermont, says companies like Burger King are betraying America’s veterans, and “have absolutely no loyalty to the people of the United States and our government.” Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, has called for a boycott. Online petitions are targeting the chain for its rank abandonment of the United States.

This outpouring of patriotic fervor is something to behold, especially from the same sort of people who used to think expecting a politician to wear a flag lapel pin was a crudely nationalistic imposition.

The left almost universally scorns the idea that a closely held family business might have religious motivations — and was outraged by the Supreme Court’s Hobby Lobby decision for this reason — yet believes that enormous globe-bestriding corporations should have patriotic feelings.

Burger King is owned, by the way, by a Brazilian private equity firm. Its Brazilian patriotism should be in doubt, too, since it showed no sign of sinking into a months-long funk after Germany crushed Brazil in the World Cup semifinal.

In most other contexts, Obama is a proud “citizen of the world.”

Except when it come to taxing businesses. Then, he is transformed into the Giuseppe Garibaldi of American progressivism. For him, patriotism is the last refuge of the taxman.

It should give him and his allies pause that Canada — boring, socialistic Canada — is a tax haven compared to the United States. How did that happen?

We now have a corporate tax system that combines the highest nominal rate in the developed world, at 35 percent, with loopholes that benefit special interests and the politically connected. Two Obama-appointed commissions have suggested major reform. On top of this, the U.S. — in a rarity for the developed world — imposes its tax rate on overseas earnings.

It is this latter factor that, as Matt Levine of Bloomberg View explains, was probably decisive. As he writes, the thought process is, “If we’re incorporated in the U.S., we’ll pay 35 percent taxes on our income in the U.S. and Canada and Mexico and Ireland and Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, but if we’re incorporated in Canada, we’ll pay 35 percent on our income in the U.S. but 15 percent in Canada and 30 percent in Mexico and 12.5 percent in Ireland and zero percent in Bermuda and zero percent in the Cayman Islands.”

Burger King says it is making a purely business decision, and it is true that the merger makes sense on the merits outside of any tax considerations.

But Burger King could have made exactly the same business decision and kept its headquarters in Miami. For that matter, it could move its headquarters to New York City and pay higher taxes still, in an awe-inspiring act of patriotic commitment.

It is not that Burger King is “shirking” on taxes on its U.S. business through its move. It will have to pay U.S. rates on that regardless. It is avoiding paying the high U.S. taxes on its overseas business, and avoiding what would in effect be a tax increase for Tim Hortons by making it subject to the U.S. system.

If this seems unscrupulous, consider the wisdom of the Sage of Omaha, Obama’s go-to economic mascot, whom he has used many a time to make arguments from authority.

Despite his support for the “Buffett rule,” which would impose a 30 percent minimum tax rate on the wealthy, Warren Buffett has no use for taxes himself and will undertake any lawful expedient to avoid them.

“I will not pay a dime more of individual taxes than I owe, and I won’t pay a dime more of corporate taxes than we owe,” he told Fortune magazine earlier this year. He was emphatic: “I will do anything that is basically covered by the law to reduce Berkshire’s tax rate.”

So it shouldn’t be a surprise that he evidently has no compunction about helping to finance a deal widely derided for minimizing Burger King’s taxes.

Despite all the yowling and patriotic chest-beating, our corporate tax system isn’t the Declaration of Independence. It isn’t Yosemite Park or the Golden Gate Bridge. It isn’t the Four Freedoms or the GI Bill. It is an ungainly, politicized disgrace that is a burden on American business.

With evidence mounting that a number of foreign and American banks colluded to alter the price of foreign currencies , the largest and least regulated financial market , prosecutors are aiming to file charges against at least one bank by the end of the year , according to interviews with lawyers briefed on the matter . Ultimately , several banks are expected to plead guilty .
Interviews with more than a dozen lawyers who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations open a window onto previously undisclosed aspects of an investigation that is unnerving Wall Street and the defense bar .

The charges will most likely focus on traders and their bosses rather than chief executives . As a result , critics of the Justice Department might view the cases as little more than an exercise in public relations , a final push to shape the legacy of Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. , who was blamed for a lack of criminal cases against Wall Street executives .
Yet the breadth of the suspected wrongdoing in the currency inquiry — Deutsche Bank , Citigroup , JPMorgan Chase , Barclays and UBS are among the dozen or so banks under investigation — might distinguish it from the piecemeal nature of the crisis-era investigations .
And prosecutors are testing a new negotiating tactic , two lawyers said , using the currency investigation as a cudgel to potentially reopen other cases . Arguing that the misconduct would violate earlier settlements involving interest rate manipulation , prosecutors have threatened to impose new penalties in the interest rate cases .
Those interest rate cases , which have already led to settlements with five banks and laid the groundwork for the currency investigation , are experiencing something of a resurgence . For one thing , prosecutors are preparing additional charges against at least one trader suspected of manipulating the London interbank offered rate , or Libor , a benchmark that underpins the cost of trillions of dollars in credit card , mortgage and other loans .
Some banks also remain under investigation . In the last major rate-rigging case against a bank , prosecutors are discussing the possibility of forcing Deutsche Bank or one of its subsidiaries to plead guilty to manipulating Libor , the lawyers said . The lawyers added that the German bank ’ s New York branch faces a separate action from Benjamin M. Lawsky , New York State ’ s banking regulator , who until now has sat out the Libor settlements .
A spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank said the bank was “ cooperating in the various regulatory investigations and conducting its own ongoing review into the interbank offered rates matters , ” adding that “ no current or former member of the management board had any inappropriate involvement . ”
The Justice Department ’ s focus on financial misdeeds comes at a time of transition ; top prosecutors are leaving its criminal division , which is handling the benchmark investigations along with the antitrust division . And for Mr. Holder , entering his final weeks at the Justice Department , the cases offer a last opportunity to address public and political complaints that prosecutors have gone soft on Wall Street .
He has sought to swing the tide through a series of recent cases : record fines against JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America and guilty pleas from Credit Suisse and BNP Paribas .
The public lust for charges is at odds with the view on Wall Street , where bankers and lawyers report fatigue with what seems like unrelenting investigations . With each inquiry , the fines have multiplied , stretching to nearly $ 17 billion for Bank of America .
And the scrutiny could drag on for years . The Justice Department , lawyers said , has widened its focus to include a criminal investigation into banks that set an important benchmark for interest rate derivatives , a previously unreported development that coincides with international regulators ’ proposing overhauls to the rate-setting process .
The flurry of activity strikes at the heart of Wall Street ’ s role in setting benchmarks across the globe . The investigations suggest that banks , seeking to benefit their own trades , have compromised the sanctity of rates like Libor and the “ 4 p.m. London fix ” for currencies , which investors use to value their positions .
As the currency investigation gains momentum , it is unclear which bank will settle first or which will plead guilty . As was the case in the Libor investigation , lawyers said , UBS was accepted into the antitrust division ’ s leniency program in exchange for its cooperation , though it still faces an action from the criminal division . Several banks , including at least one American bank , are expected to plead guilty .
Prosecutors have explained publicly that banks would earn credit for exposing their misbehaving employees or face charges for protecting them . Already , banks have fired or suspended about 30 employees linked to the currency investigation , although no one has been accused of wrongdoing .
While prosecutors are aiming to bring at least one currency case this year , the heavy workload could delay action until early next year . The pace also could stall as prosecutors seek to coordinate with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , Mr. Lawsky and federal banking regulators .
In Britain , however , regulators are nearing a settlement with several banks in the currency case . The Financial Conduct Authority of Britain met last month with six banks — Citigroup , JPMorgan , Barclays , UBS , the Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC — to discuss the contours of a collective settlement that it plans to announce this fall .
Those banks are not necessarily the most culpable , but rather the ones most willing to reach a settlement . While American prosecutors have not ruled out joining a global settlement , lawyers said , such a move appears unlikely .
Altogether , the British regulator could collect fines that total up to $ 3.3 billion , people briefed on that settlement said . Of the six banks , one person said , the size of Citigroup ’ s payout is expected to fall in the middle .
Banks are eager to put the case behind them as they prepare to submit their capital plans to the Federal Reserve . Under the Fed ’ s rules , the banks must set aside enough cash to cover a potential settlement , which can become an expensive guessing game without clarity from prosecutors .
At Deutsche Bank , facing both Libor and currency investigations , there is growing momentum to resolve at least one of them . In the Libor case , prosecutors have begun to coordinate with the bank ’ s American regulators , including Mr. Lawsky , about the fallout from a potential guilty plea for the bank or one of its subsidiaries , lawyers said . That planning reflects a desire to criminally punish the bank without imperiling its ability to operate in the United States .
At their core , the investigations into Libor and currency trading center on suspicions that banks manipulated the benchmarks for their own gain . In Libor , a measure of how much banks charge one another for loans , several banks submitted false rates to benefit their trading positions .
The foreign exchange inquiry has pointed to a more complex scheme to fix currency prices and game the market . Authorities suspect that banks , using information gleaned from their clients , collaborated to flood the market with orders just seconds before the so-called 4 p.m. fix , which serves as the benchmark for foreign exchange rates . The aim in part , authorities suspect , was to drive up the price of , say , euros before selling them to clients at an inflated price .
Traders at competing banks met in private chat rooms . Some traders became so cozy that they earned the nickname “ the cartel ” and “ the bandits club . ”

The Justice Department is preparing a fresh round of attacks on the world’s biggest banks, again questioning Wall Street’s role in a broad array of financial markets.

With evidence mounting that a number of foreign and American banks colluded to alter the price of foreign currencies, the largest and least regulated financial market, prosecutors are aiming to file charges against at least one bank by the end of the year, according to interviews with lawyers briefed on the matter. Ultimately, several banks are expected to plead guilty.

Interviews with more than a dozen lawyers who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations open a window onto previously undisclosed aspects of an investigation that is unnerving Wall Street and the defense bar. While cases stemming from the financial crisis were aimed at institutions, prosecutors are planning to eventually indict individual bank employees over currency manipulation, using their instant messages as incriminating evidence.

The charges will most likely focus on traders and their bosses rather than chief executives. As a result, critics of the Justice Department might view the cases as little more than an exercise in public relations, a final push to shape the legacy of Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., who was blamed for a lack of criminal cases against Wall Street executives.

Yet the breadth of the suspected wrongdoing in the currency inquiry — Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Barclays and UBS are among the dozen or so banks under investigation — might distinguish it from the piecemeal nature of the crisis-era investigations.

And prosecutors are testing a new negotiating tactic, two lawyers said, using the currency investigation as a cudgel to potentially reopen other cases. Arguing that the misconduct would violate earlier settlements involving interest rate manipulation, prosecutors have threatened to impose new penalties in the interest rate cases.

Those interest rate cases, which have already led to settlements with five banks and laid the groundwork for the currency investigation, are experiencing something of a resurgence. For one thing, prosecutors are preparing additional charges against at least one trader suspected of manipulating the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a benchmark that underpins the cost of trillions of dollars in credit card, mortgage and other loans.

Some banks also remain under investigation. In the last major rate-rigging case against a bank, prosecutors are discussing the possibility of forcing Deutsche Bank or one of its subsidiaries to plead guilty to manipulating Libor, the lawyers said. The lawyers added that the German bank’s New York branch faces a separate action from Benjamin M. Lawsky, New York State’s banking regulator, who until now has sat out the Libor settlements.

A spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank said the bank was “cooperating in the various regulatory investigations and conducting its own ongoing review into the interbank offered rates matters,” adding that “no current or former member of the management board had any inappropriate involvement.”

The public lust for charges is at odds with the view on Wall Street, where bankers and lawyers report fatigue with what seems like unrelenting investigations. With each inquiry, the fines have multiplied, stretching to nearly $17 billion for Bank of America.

And the scrutiny could drag on for years. The Justice Department, lawyers said, has widened its focus to include a criminal investigation into banks that set an important benchmark for interest rate derivatives, a previously unreported development that coincides with international regulators’ proposing overhauls to the rate-setting process.

The flurry of activity strikes at the heart of Wall Street’s role in setting benchmarks across the globe. The investigations suggest that banks, seeking to benefit their own trades, have compromised the sanctity of rates like Libor and the “4 p.m. London fix” for currencies, which investors use to value their positions.

As the currency investigation gains momentum, it is unclear which bank will settle first or which will plead guilty. As was the case in the Libor investigation, lawyers said, UBS was accepted into the antitrust division’s leniency program in exchange for its cooperation, though it still faces an action from the criminal division. Several banks, including at least one American bank, are expected to plead guilty.

Prosecutors have explained publicly that banks would earn credit for exposing their misbehaving employees or face charges for protecting them. Already, banks have fired or suspended about 30 employees linked to the currency investigation, although no one has been accused of wrongdoing.

While prosecutors are aiming to bring at least one currency case this year, the heavy workload could delay action until early next year. The pace also could stall as prosecutors seek to coordinate with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Mr. Lawsky and federal banking regulators.

In Britain, however, regulators are nearing a settlement with several banks in the currency case. The Financial Conduct Authority of Britain met last month with six banks — Citigroup, JPMorgan, Barclays, UBS, the Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC — to discuss the contours of a collective settlement that it plans to announce this fall.

Those banks are not necessarily the most culpable, but rather the ones most willing to reach a settlement. While American prosecutors have not ruled out joining a global settlement, lawyers said, such a move appears unlikely.

Altogether, the British regulator could collect fines that total up to $3.3 billion, people briefed on that settlement said. Of the six banks, one person said, the size of Citigroup’s payout is expected to fall in the middle.

Banks are eager to put the case behind them as they prepare to submit their capital plans to the Federal Reserve. Under the Fed’s rules, the banks must set aside enough cash to cover a potential settlement, which can become an expensive guessing game without clarity from prosecutors.

At Deutsche Bank, facing both Libor and currency investigations, there is growing momentum to resolve at least one of them. In the Libor case, prosecutors have begun to coordinate with the bank’s American regulators, including Mr. Lawsky, about the fallout from a potential guilty plea for the bank or one of its subsidiaries, lawyers said. That planning reflects a desire to criminally punish the bank without imperiling its ability to operate in the United States.

At their core, the investigations into Libor and currency trading center on suspicions that banks manipulated the benchmarks for their own gain. In Libor, a measure of how much banks charge one another for loans, several banks submitted false rates to benefit their trading positions.

The foreign exchange inquiry has pointed to a more complex scheme to fix currency prices and game the market. Authorities suspect that banks, using information gleaned from their clients, collaborated to flood the market with orders just seconds before the so-called 4 p.m. fix, which serves as the benchmark for foreign exchange rates. The aim in part, authorities suspect, was to drive up the price of, say, euros before selling them to clients at an inflated price.

Traders at competing banks met in private chat rooms. Some traders became so cozy that they earned the nickname “the cartel” and “the bandits club.”

U.S. Investigates Currency Trades by Major Banks Eric H. Holder Jr., the U.S. attorney general, says groups of traders from several major banks may have influenced currency benchmarks to benefit their employers.

banking_and_finance,CNBC,1,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/27/coronavirus-pandemic-could-inflict-long-lasting-emotional-trauma-ptsd.html,"Coronavirus pandemic could inflict emotional trauma and PTSD on an unprecedented scale, scientists warn",2020-03-27,Tucker Higgins,"Researchers are warning that the coronavirus pandemic could inflict long-lasting emotional trauma on an unprecedented global scale . They say it could leave millions wrestling with debilitating psychological disorders while dashing hopes for a swift economic recovery . The COVID-19 crisis has combined mental health stressors that have been studied before in other disasters , but which have never been seen consolidated in one global crisis , experts in trauma psychology said . It has left millions without jobs , sent billions into isolation and forced nearly everyone on earth to grapple with the feeling that they or those they love are suddenly physically vulnerable . The nature of the disease means that there can be no certainty about when the worst will pass . Hundreds of thousands have been infected , thousands have died , the virus continues to spread , and a vaccine could be more than a year away . `` The scale of this outbreak as a traumatic event is almost beyond comprehension , '' said Yuval Neria , the director of trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder at the New York State Psychiatric Institute and a professor of psychology at Columbia University Medical Center . Neria , seeking a precedent to point to , said that not even the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks or World War II were adequate comparisons , as the anxiety those events caused was at least limited by geography . In this case , he said , `` there are no boundaries . '' Elana Newman , who researches trauma and disaster mental health at the University of Tulsa , said she has had to consult the literature of several different subjects to get a handle on the unfolding crisis . There is research on how humans cope with quarantine , mass disasters and ongoing stressors , she said , but not on all three . `` This is a mass community disaster , but it is also a little bit like terrorism in that the fear component is there , ongoing fear , '' Newman said .
More than half a million cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed worldwide , leaving nearly 30,000 dead , according to data from Johns Hopkins University . The United States surpassed China and Italy on Thursday to become the country with the largest outbreak , and now has more than 100,000 cases . The public health disaster has become a financial catastrophe , halting the 11-year bull run in the stock market and sending weekly jobless claims to a record nearly five times higher than the worst of the 2008 recession this week . President Donald Trump and members of his administration have predicted that the economic recovery will be swift once the outbreak is contained . On Tuesday , Trump said on Fox News that he `` would love to have the country opened up , and rarin ' to go by Easter . '' Vice President Mike Pence said on Friday that the economy would `` come roaring back once we see our nation through this . '' On Friday , the president signed a stimulus package , worth more than $ 2 trillion , intended to blunt the economic damage from the pandemic . But estimates of a v-shaped recovery are n't factoring in psychology , according to Peter Atwater , a behavioral economist at William & Mary who studies consumer decision-making . `` You can open it up . But this is not a field of dreams . You can build it , but they might not come , '' Atwater said . He predicted that as a result of the crisis , emotionally scarred consumers are likely to spend less and save more — a type of `` Great Depression mindset . '' `` There were no skid marks — the car went straight the into the wall , '' Atwater said . `` That sense of vulnerability will be quite lasting . '' Andrew Rigie , the executive director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance , a nonprofit advocating for the city 's bars and restaurants , said he was concerned that anxiety and fear from the virus could outlast the pandemic itself , possibly prolonging the economic woes saddling the industry and the city . He said he hoped that anxiety would not `` override human nature 's pull to bring us together . ''
Those who are financially crippled by the crisis or who experience the loss of loved ones are also the most susceptible to enduring psychological trauma , according to experts . Those who already had mental health problems , such as addiction , are also at risk . `` What we know from mass disasters is that the people who have experienced direct interpersonal loss or financial loss have a harder time bouncing back , '' Newman said . Researchers at Peking University in Beijing wrote in a February correspondence in The Lancet , a prestigious medical journal , that the mental health disorders inflicted on those on the front lines of the crisis could `` exceed the consequences '' of the virus itself . About one in 10 employees at a Chinese hospital who dealt with the 2003 SARS outbreak reported high levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms in a study conducted three years later . A 2004 study of 129 people in Canada who were voluntarily quarantined during the outbreak found that nearly a third exhibited symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder or depression . But trauma experts say that relatively new research has shown that even those who are not directly affected by the crisis are at risk for post-traumatic stress disorder . `` After 9/11 , we had the first indication that even people who were not directly exposed to trauma , but spent many hours in front of the television or looking at their smart phones were at high risk for psychopathology , including PTSD , depression and anxiety , '' Neria said .
Neria said that given the global scale of the current pandemic , it is likely that millions will need mental heath care . Right now , he said , the focus was not on mental trauma .

Researchers are warning that the coronavirus pandemic could inflict long-lasting emotional trauma on an unprecedented global scale. They say it could leave millions wrestling with debilitating psychological disorders while dashing hopes for a swift economic recovery. The COVID-19 crisis has combined mental health stressors that have been studied before in other disasters, but which have never been seen consolidated in one global crisis, experts in trauma psychology said. It has left millions without jobs, sent billions into isolation and forced nearly everyone on earth to grapple with the feeling that they or those they love are suddenly physically vulnerable. The nature of the disease means that there can be no certainty about when the worst will pass. Hundreds of thousands have been infected, thousands have died, the virus continues to spread, and a vaccine could be more than a year away. ""The scale of this outbreak as a traumatic event is almost beyond comprehension,"" said Yuval Neria, the director of trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder at the New York State Psychiatric Institute and a professor of psychology at Columbia University Medical Center. Neria, seeking a precedent to point to, said that not even the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks or World War II were adequate comparisons, as the anxiety those events caused was at least limited by geography. In this case, he said, ""there are no boundaries."" Elana Newman, who researches trauma and disaster mental health at the University of Tulsa, said she has had to consult the literature of several different subjects to get a handle on the unfolding crisis. There is research on how humans cope with quarantine, mass disasters and ongoing stressors, she said, but not on all three. ""This is a mass community disaster, but it is also a little bit like terrorism in that the fear component is there, ongoing fear,"" Newman said.

A question of recovery

More than half a million cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed worldwide, leaving nearly 30,000 dead, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The United States surpassed China and Italy on Thursday to become the country with the largest outbreak, and now has more than 100,000 cases. The public health disaster has become a financial catastrophe, halting the 11-year bull run in the stock market and sending weekly jobless claims to a record nearly five times higher than the worst of the 2008 recession this week. President Donald Trump and members of his administration have predicted that the economic recovery will be swift once the outbreak is contained. On Tuesday, Trump said on Fox News that he ""would love to have the country opened up, and rarin' to go by Easter."" Vice President Mike Pence said on Friday that the economy would ""come roaring back once we see our nation through this."" On Friday, the president signed a stimulus package, worth more than $2 trillion, intended to blunt the economic damage from the pandemic. But estimates of a v-shaped recovery aren't factoring in psychology, according to Peter Atwater, a behavioral economist at William & Mary who studies consumer decision-making. ""You can open it up. But this is not a field of dreams. You can build it, but they might not come,"" Atwater said. He predicted that as a result of the crisis, emotionally scarred consumers are likely to spend less and save more — a type of ""Great Depression mindset."" ""There were no skid marks — the car went straight the into the wall,"" Atwater said. ""That sense of vulnerability will be quite lasting."" Andrew Rigie, the executive director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance, a nonprofit advocating for the city's bars and restaurants, said he was concerned that anxiety and fear from the virus could outlast the pandemic itself, possibly prolonging the economic woes saddling the industry and the city. He said he hoped that anxiety would not ""override human nature's pull to bring us together.""

'A harder time bouncing back'

Those who are financially crippled by the crisis or who experience the loss of loved ones are also the most susceptible to enduring psychological trauma, according to experts. Those who already had mental health problems, such as addiction, are also at risk. ""What we know from mass disasters is that the people who have experienced direct interpersonal loss or financial loss have a harder time bouncing back,"" Newman said. Researchers at Peking University in Beijing wrote in a February correspondence in The Lancet, a prestigious medical journal, that the mental health disorders inflicted on those on the front lines of the crisis could ""exceed the consequences"" of the virus itself. About one in 10 employees at a Chinese hospital who dealt with the 2003 SARS outbreak reported high levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms in a study conducted three years later. A 2004 study of 129 people in Canada who were voluntarily quarantined during the outbreak found that nearly a third exhibited symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder or depression. But trauma experts say that relatively new research has shown that even those who are not directly affected by the crisis are at risk for post-traumatic stress disorder. ""After 9/11, we had the first indication that even people who were not directly exposed to trauma, but spent many hours in front of the television or looking at their smart phones were at high risk for psychopathology, including PTSD, depression and anxiety,"" Neria said.

There is help

Neria said that given the global scale of the current pandemic, it is likely that millions will need mental heath care. Right now, he said, the focus was not on mental trauma. But that could change. ""I hope we will be ready for this. People will need us,"" Neria wrote in an email. Some states are already taking action. In New York, the state hardest-hit by coronavirus, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced on Wednesday a free mental health hotline, staffed by 6,000 volunteers. ""We're all concerned about the immediate critical need. The life and death of the immediate situation, which is right,"" Cuomo said during a press conference announcing the support line. ""But don't underestimate the emotional trauma that people are feeling, and the emotional health issues."" Those who suffer from mental health disorders can be treated with therapy and, in some cases, medication. Exposure-based treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder, which involve survivors recalling and describing the traumatic event, work about half the time, according to Neria. For the other half of patients, studies have shown other methods to be effective. But experts say there are steps that individuals can take even while the crisis continues that can limit its psychological toll, such as limiting exposure to television news and social media. ""Each person needs to figure out, what is the optimal amount of information they need to make choices,"" Newman said.

Sands,"The battle of wills between Beijing and Washington over a China-sponsored development bank for Asia is turning into a rout , and the Obama administration has found itself isolated and embarrassed as its top allies lined up this week to join the proposed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank .
In what one analyst dubbed a “ diplomatic disaster ” for the U.S. , Britain became the first major European ally to sign on as a founding member of the Shanghai-based investment bank , joined quickly by France , Germany and Italy , which dismissed public and private warnings from the U.S. about the bank ’ s potential impact on global lending standards and the competition it could provide to existing institutions such as the U.S.-dominated World Bank .
Luxembourg , a major global financial center , revealed this week that it would sign up . China also is also wooing Australia and South Korea , two of America ’ s closest Asian allies , to join before the March 31 deadline . A South Korean wire service reported Wednesday that Seoul was “ seriously considering ” the offer .
The reason for the stampede is clear : China ’ s market and its huge hoard of cash to invest override any concerns voiced by the U.S. Treasury Department and State Department over Beijing ’ s half-ownership stake in the bank .
“ Simply put , if you partake , you have a stake , ” Thomas Koenig , a policy analyst with the European Union Chamber of Commerce , told the German broadcast service Deutsche Welle .
With 32 countries on board and more expected in the coming days , Chinese state media have begun to gloat about the failure of the Obama administration to rally even its closest allies and trading partners to shun the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank . They noted that U.S. officials have long lectured China , now the world ’ s second-largest economy , to take a more active “ stakeholder ” role in global economic affairs , but then tried to undermine the investment bank almost from the time Chinese President Xi Jinping floated the idea of an Asian development fund during a trip to Indonesia in October 2013 .
“ Welcome Germany ! Welcome France ! Welcome Italy ! ” the official Chinese Xinhua News Agency wrote in a commentary published Wednesday .
“ Despite a petulant and cynical Washington , ” more and more major countries are joining , the commentary noted . “ Holding sour grapes over the AIIB makes America look isolated and hypocritical . ”
Chinese officials noted Wednesday that the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank will be on the agenda for the summit of top Chinese , Japanese and South Korean diplomats Saturday in Seoul . Chinese Deputy Finance Minister Shi Yaobin told reporters in Beijing that the U.S. would still be welcomed as a founding partner .
Saying Asia ’ s booming infrastructure financing needs — estimated at a staggering $ 700 billion annually — aren ’ t being met by institutions such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank , China is putting up half of the planned initial $ 50 billion financing to launch the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank . India , another U.S. ally , is the second-biggest investor , and a group of developing countries from Asia and the Middle East quickly signed on .
The Obama administration has been skeptical of the idea from the start , arguing that the proposed bank could prove redundant and could undercut lending standards on such issues as worker protections and the environment . China ’ s large stake also raised red flags , U.S. officials said , about whether the bank would favor Beijing ’ s economic and strategic priorities .
Underlying the public debate was a clear clash between Washington and Beijing over clout in the globe ’ s leading financial infrastructure , set up largely by the United States in the wake of World War II and still largely dominated in the senior ranks by U.S. , European and Japanese officials .
“ We are wary about a trend toward constant accommodation of China , which is not the best way to engage a rising power , ” an unidentified U.S. official told the Financial Times newspaper after news broke that Britain would join the bank .
Rising powers such as China , Brazil and India also have expressed mounting frustration that a proposed overhaul of the International Monetary Fund to reset voting rights to reflect the new global pecking order has been blocked because the Obama administration and the Republican-dominated Congress have been unable to pass it .
Analysts say Chinese officials have skillfully tried to meet concerns that Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank members will be drawn into a power clash . During a visit to Australia last month , Zhou Qiangwu , a point man for Beijing ’ s selling efforts , noted that the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank would be run by a multinational secretariat and use the same management structure as the Asian Development Bank and World Bank .
The proposed bank would “ follow the international practice and give highest attention to environmental impact and resettlement ” issues , he said , with strong safeguards against corruption .
Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew tried to moderate the U.S. line against the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in testimony on Capitol Hill this week , insisting that the administration ’ s primary goal was to ensure that the bank did not undermine lending standards .
“ I hope before the final commitments are made anyone who lends their name to this organization will make sure that the governance is appropriate , ” Mr. Lew said .
But the White House and the State Department said this week that it was the “ sovereign decision ” of each country on whether to participate in the bank .
Mr. Lew did acknowledge that the longtime U.S. and Western primacy in the global financial sphere was being challenged by China and other rising powers , which may not share Washington ’ s priorities .
“ New players are challenging U.S. leadership in the multilateral system , ” Mr. Lew said , pleading for passage of the IMF reform package . “ Our international credibility and influence are being threatened . ”
But private analysts say that credibility and influence have taken major hits from the rush to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank .
C. Fred Bergsten , a senior fellow at the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics , wrote this week that the Obama administration made a huge mistake by trying to undermine the bank , not only failing to persuade allies to stay out but also strengthening the voices in Beijing who argue that the U.S. is trying to keep China down .
“ The U.S. hostility reinforces the Chinese view that U.S. strategy is to contain and suppress it , ” he wrote , “ so increasing rather than decreasing the prospect of uncooperative Chinese behavior . ”
Financial Times columnist Gideon Rachman said this week that the saga “ is turning into a diplomatic debacle for the U.S . ”

The blue-chip index changed direction 29 times over the course of the session before surging in the final hour to close up 567.02 points , or 2.3 % , at 24912.77 . ( Follow live analysis of today ’ s markets . )
Investors struggled to keep pace as volatility returned in force to the stock market . Equity benchmarks from Tokyo to Madrid plunged overnight , and the opening hour of U.S. trading was especially frenetic with the Dow falling as much as 567 points and briefly flirting with correction levels .
Many individuals trying to place orders had trouble accessing their investment accounts , taking to Twitter to report outages and slowdowns on the websites of discount brokerages and mutual-fund firms including TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. AMTD -1.21 % and Fidelity Investments .
Meanwhile , professional traders from New York to Hong Kong described a sense of lingering unease as major indexes oscillated in choppy trade . An online discussion thread titled “ The Dow has lost 1,000 points in two days ” on the forum Reddit had generated more than 4,700 comments by Tuesday afternoon .
But some novice investors like Kayleigh Kemper , a 31-year-old stay-at-home mother in Peoria , Ill. , rushed to try to scoop up shares at a discount .
“ I see the market dropping as an opportunity for those of us who don ’ t have a chance to play all the time , ” said Ms. Kemper , who added $ 500 to her new account on the stock-trading app Robinhood to buy the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF .
The Dow ’ s late-day gain put the index back in positive territory for the year , up 0.8 % , and marked its largest jump of the year on a point and percentage basis . It is still down 6.4 % from its Jan. 26 high .
The index swung 1,167.49 points from its high to its low on Tuesday . That marked the second-biggest intraday trading range in the Dow ’ s history . The largest : Monday ’ s 1,596.65-point swing that ended with the index closing down 1,175.21 points .
The S & P 500 , which lost $ 965.9 billion in market value following Monday ’ s declines , gained 1.7 % on Tuesday , and the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.1 % .
While U.S. markets stanched the red ink on Tuesday , losses overseas were steep . The Stoxx Europe 600 fell 2.4 % , posting its largest one-day decline since June 2016 , shortly after the surprise U.K. vote to leave the European Union . Hong Kong ’ s Hang Seng lost 5.1 % , or 1,650 points , its biggest point decline since January 2008 .
Meanwhile , the Cboe Volatility Index—known as Wall Street ’ s fear gauge—fell 20 % after surging 115.6 % Monday in what was its biggest one-day jump on record .
While Tuesday ’ s turn higher in the U.S. market was welcome to investors , many believed that the sudden onslaught of volatility hadn ’ t ended . “ As the market drips higher , confidence is slowly coming back . But many feel like we aren ’ t out of the woods yet , ” said Mohit Bajaj , director of ETF trading solutions at WallachBeth Capital .
Some investors attributed the choppy trading to lingering nervousness from the abrupt market reversal of previous days and the return of volatility following a period of prolonged market calm .
There was no obvious catalyst for the selloff that began last week , but investors have started to question whether a pickup in inflation will force central banks to tighten monetary policy more than anticipated , posing a risk to the yearslong rally in stocks .
Government bonds strengthened for a second day , with the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note falling to 2.766 % from 2.794 % Monday .
Still , with earnings and global economic growth looking strong , the outlook for the stock market remains positive over the long term , said Tom Anderson , chief investment officer at Boston Private Wealth .
Meanwhile , several financial advisers—some of whom had geared up to receive a flood of inquiries from clients—said business was calmer than they had anticipated .
“ We were expecting the phone to go off the hook , ” said Winnie Sun , founder of Sun Group Wealth Partners in Irvine , Calif. “ We got a couple of calls , but it wasn ’ t anything like 2008 . ”
Ms. Sun and other advisers say they have been preparing clients for a market correction for the past 12 to 18 months , moving more money to cash and engaging in regular conversations about declines as markets notched high after high . Instead of calming worried investors , some advisers said they have been fielding questions about whether now is the time to add to equity holdings .
“ We think there will be more chances , ” said Danie McHugh , partner at Summit Trail Advisors in New York , who added that she had received calls from clients asking if “ this is the 10 % pullback we ’ ve been waiting for . ”

Investors struggled to keep pace as volatility returned in force to the stock market. Equity benchmarks from Tokyo to Madrid plunged overnight, and the opening hour of U.S. trading was especially frenetic with the Dow falling as much as 567 points and briefly flirting with correction levels.

Many individuals trying to place orders had trouble accessing their investment accounts, taking to Twitter to report outages and slowdowns on the websites of discount brokerages and mutual-fund firms including TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. AMTD -1.21% and Fidelity Investments.

Meanwhile, professional traders from New York to Hong Kong described a sense of lingering unease as major indexes oscillated in choppy trade. An online discussion thread titled “The Dow has lost 1,000 points in two days” on the forum Reddit had generated more than 4,700 comments by Tuesday afternoon.

But some novice investors like Kayleigh Kemper, a 31-year-old stay-at-home mother in Peoria, Ill., rushed to try to scoop up shares at a discount.

“I see the market dropping as an opportunity for those of us who don’t have a chance to play all the time,” said Ms. Kemper, who added $500 to her new account on the stock-trading app Robinhood to buy the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF.

The Dow’s late-day gain put the index back in positive territory for the year, up 0.8%, and marked its largest jump of the year on a point and percentage basis. It is still down 6.4% from its Jan. 26 high.

The index swung 1,167.49 points from its high to its low on Tuesday. That marked the second-biggest intraday trading range in the Dow’s history. The largest: Monday’s 1,596.65-point swing that ended with the index closing down 1,175.21 points.

The S&P 500, which lost $965.9 billion in market value following Monday’s declines, gained 1.7% on Tuesday, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.1%.

While U.S. markets stanched the red ink on Tuesday, losses overseas were steep. The Stoxx Europe 600 fell 2.4%, posting its largest one-day decline since June 2016, shortly after the surprise U.K. vote to leave the European Union. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng lost 5.1%, or 1,650 points, its biggest point decline since January 2008.

Meanwhile, the Cboe Volatility Index—known as Wall Street’s fear gauge—fell 20% after surging 115.6% Monday in what was its biggest one-day jump on record.

While Tuesday’s turn higher in the U.S. market was welcome to investors, many believed that the sudden onslaught of volatility hadn’t ended. “As the market drips higher, confidence is slowly coming back. But many feel like we aren’t out of the woods yet,” said Mohit Bajaj, director of ETF trading solutions at WallachBeth Capital.

Some investors attributed the choppy trading to lingering nervousness from the abrupt market reversal of previous days and the return of volatility following a period of prolonged market calm.

There was no obvious catalyst for the selloff that began last week, but investors have started to question whether a pickup in inflation will force central banks to tighten monetary policy more than anticipated, posing a risk to the yearslong rally in stocks.

Government bonds strengthened for a second day, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note falling to 2.766% from 2.794% Monday.

Still, with earnings and global economic growth looking strong, the outlook for the stock market remains positive over the long term, said Tom Anderson, chief investment officer at Boston Private Wealth.

Meanwhile, several financial advisers—some of whom had geared up to receive a flood of inquiries from clients—said business was calmer than they had anticipated.

“We were expecting the phone to go off the hook,” said Winnie Sun, founder of Sun Group Wealth Partners in Irvine, Calif. “We got a couple of calls, but it wasn’t anything like 2008.”

Ms. Sun and other advisers say they have been preparing clients for a market correction for the past 12 to 18 months, moving more money to cash and engaging in regular conversations about declines as markets notched high after high. Instead of calming worried investors, some advisers said they have been fielding questions about whether now is the time to add to equity holdings.

“We think there will be more chances,” said Danie McHugh, partner at Summit Trail Advisors in New York, who added that she had received calls from clients asking if “this is the 10% pullback we’ve been waiting for.”

""So many Americans across the country view their own economic and financial circumstances through their homes and whether they own a home, whether their home is underwater, whether they feel like they have equity in their homes,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday.

Senior administration officials said Obama would focus in Phoenix on shifting more of the burden for supporting the nation's massive mortgage market to the private sector. A centerpiece of that effort is his support for winding down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

The White House has already lauded efforts to achieve that goal spearheaded by Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee and Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia. While Obama will outline his own proposals on Tuesday, his plans are largely in line with the bipartisan Senate overhaul.

Officials said Obama will insist that the government only step in to pay out mortgage guarantees after private capital has been exhausted and that private capital bear the substantial majority of any losses. He will also call for Fannie and Freddie's investment portfolios to be wound down by at least 15 percent per year.

Obama advisers did not outline a specific timeframe for winding down Fannie and Freddie. The Corker-Warner legislation would shutter the operations within five years.

Fannie and Freddie were nationalized during the 2008 financial collapse and bailed out with $187 billion in taxpayer-funded loans. The two enterprises don't directly make loans, but buy mortgages from lenders, package them as bonds, guarantee them against default and sell them to investors.

Fannie and Freddie currently own or guarantee half of all U.S. mortgages and back nearly 90 percent of new ones.

Against the backdrop of Phoenix's reinvigorated housing market, Obama will also tout refinancing proposals that gained little traction on Capitol Hill when he first unveiled them last year.

The officials insisted on anonymity in order to preview the president's remarks ahead of his trip.

The nationwide housing recovery has been providing critical support to the economy at a time when manufacturing and business investment have stagnated. Steady job growth and low mortgage rates in the past year have also fueled more home sales. The increased demand, along with a tight supply of homes for sale, has pushed home prices higher. That's encouraged builders to start more homes and create more construction jobs.

The recovery in Phoenix is emblematic of the larger improvements happening in many parts of the country.

Just two years ago, the region was in the throes of the worst housing collapse in the country, with prices down nearly 60 percent from their June 2006 peak and banks foreclosing on 70,000 homeowners a year.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 2,997.10 points lower , or 12.9 % , at 20,188.52 . The 30-stock Dow was briefly down more than 3,000 points in the final minutes of trading . The S & P 500 dropped 12 % to 2,386.13 — hitting its lowest level since December 2018 — while the Nasdaq Composite closed 12.3 % lower at 6,904.59 in its worst day ever .
`` The markets are getting no break with yesterday 's historic Fed actions and COVID-19 dominating the world 's headlines , '' Frank Cappelleri , executive director at Instinet , said in a note . `` While the news continues to worsen and with the price action doing things we 've only seen a handful of other times in the last century , it 's nearly impossible to keep things in perspective . ''
`` We ca n't argue the facts , and we 're dealing with a much bigger issue than just the economy , '' Cappelleri said .
The major averages fell to their lows into the close after President Donald Trump said the worst of the outbreak could last until August . He also told reporters the U.S. `` may be '' heading into a recession .
`` The market did n't hear what it wanted to hear . I do n't think that it wanted to hear that this was going to last until July and August , and now the market does the math . If it lasts until July and August , that means we maybe have a contraction in the second quarter and the third quarter , and that means recession , '' BNY Mellon strategist Liz Young said on ███ 's `` Closing Bell .

Monday 's losses put the Dow down 31.7 % from its all-time high and the S & P 500 and Nasdaq more than 29 % below their records last month . The Dow fell to its lowest point since 2017 .
The Dow 's drop was the worst decline since its `` Black Monday '' crash three decades ago when it fell more than 22 % . The drop surpassed its 9.99 % tumble last Thursday . It was also the Dow 's third-worst day ever ; it dropped more than 13 % in late 1929 .","Stocks fell sharply Monday — with the Dow suffering its worst day since the ""Black Monday"" market crash in 1987 and its third-worst day ever — even after the Federal Reserve embarked on a massive monetary stimulus campaign to curb slower economic growth amid the coronavirus outbreak.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 2,997.10 points lower, or 12.9%, at 20,188.52. The 30-stock Dow was briefly down more than 3,000 points in the final minutes of trading. The S&P 500 dropped 12% to 2,386.13 — hitting its lowest level since December 2018 — while the Nasdaq Composite closed 12.3% lower at 6,904.59 in its worst day ever.

""The markets are getting no break with yesterday's historic Fed actions and COVID-19 dominating the world's headlines,"" Frank Cappelleri, executive director at Instinet, said in a note. ""While the news continues to worsen and with the price action doing things we've only seen a handful of other times in the last century, it's nearly impossible to keep things in perspective.""

""We can't argue the facts, and we're dealing with a much bigger issue than just the economy,"" Cappelleri said.

The major averages fell to their lows into the close after President Donald Trump said the worst of the outbreak could last until August. He also told reporters the U.S. ""may be"" heading into a recession.

""The market didn't hear what it wanted to hear. I don't think that it wanted to hear that this was going to last until July and August, and now the market does the math. If it lasts until July and August, that means we maybe have a contraction in the second quarter and the third quarter, and that means recession,"" BNY Mellon strategist Liz Young said on CNBC's ""Closing Bell.""

Monday's losses put the Dow down 31.7% from its all-time high and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq more than 29% below their records last month. The Dow fell to its lowest point since 2017.

During the day’s wild trading session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped by just under 10% in what was the largest single-day percentage decline since the stock market crash in 1987 (when markets were sufficiently scarred to institute failsafe measures for the future, to prevent similar, shocking declines).

Investors shrugged off news that the Federal Reserve was stepping in to offer nearly $1.5 trillion in emergency relief as the major indexes all fell sharply the morning after President Donald Trump addressed the nation to outline the government’s continued response to the novel coronavirus outbreak.

Looking at the major American indices:

The Dow fell by 9.99% or 2,352.60 points to close at 21,200.62

The Nasdaq tumbled 9.43%, or 750.25, to close at 7,201.80

The S&P 500 dropped 9.5% or 260.74 points to close at 2,480.64

If you are keeping score on the week, this is the third day of massive declines against a single day’s gains. Tuesday now feels very long ago.

Why the sell-off?

It’s possible that investors continued their selling streak because any short-term gains from the Federal Reserve’s efforts to reverse the slide may not be able to bolster the short and long-term health of the American — and global — economy. (The American and global economics are incredibly linked, of course).

“We continue to emphasize that this Fed will act aggressively and in particular that central banks are focused on safeguarding market functioning at this point, and will continue to provide liquidity in scale,” Ebrahim Rahbari, director of global economics at Citi Research, told CNBC. “However, despite the sharp initial risk rally, we think these measures will still not be sufficient to durably stabilize market sentiment yet in light of credit concerns and escalating health concerns.”

Meanwhile, more American institutions are being disrupted by efforts to mitigate the spread of the novel coronavirus sweeping the country. Broadway was shut down, major sports events have all been canceled and entire seasons are being put on hold.

Airlines and the travel industry were hit particularly hard today with shares of United Airlines down 12.26%, Delta off 21% and American Airlines seeing a 17.28% drop as of market close. Airlines are bearing the brunt of a decision issued Wednesday evening by President Trump to ban travel between the U.S. and Europe for the next 30 days. Today, airlines started canceling flights. Delta said it will temporarily cancel flights between cities like Amsterdam and Orlando, Portland and Salt Lake City, as well as flights to Paris from Cincinnati, Raleigh/Durham and Indianapolis.

It’s against that backdrop that investors took to the hills yet again today. And all this ahead of the country being ready to truly ramp up its COVID-19 testing regime.

Not even cryptocurrencies were safe from the rout. Bitcoin and all of the other major cryptocurrencies suffered their worst declines in years as investors also sold heavily. SaaS shares were down over 8%, and after-hours, Slack’s earnings failed to excite and its equity is being sold off. In short, if you were looking for a silver lining, there isn’t one today.

The World Bank's goal is to end extreme poverty and to grow income for the poorest people on the planet.

The bank does this by lending money and giving grants to governments and private corporations in some of the least developed places on the planet. For example, money goes to preserving land, building dams and creating health care systems.

But a lot of poor people actually end up worse off because of those projects, a report from The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists found.

People are often displaced, or their livelihoods are ruined. Over the past decade an estimated 3.4 million people have been displaced by bank-funded projects, says Michael Hudson, a senior editor at ICIJ, who worked on the report. In one instance, hundreds of families had their homes burned down.

""The World Bank has promised 'do no harm,' but our reporting has found that the World Bank has broken this promise,"" Hudson says.

In response, the World Bank says the vast majority of its projects don't involve the resettlement of people. But the bank says it has identified shortcomings in its resettlement policies. And it plans to improve those policies to protect people and businesses affected by bank-funded projects.

ICIJ's Hudson spoke to NPR's Steve Inskeep on Morning Edition about the new report, which he and his team worked on with The Huffington Post and other outlets.

A lot of these projects seem beneficial. But you found that something is going wrong. What is it?

What is often going wrong is what happens to people on the ground when you do these big projects. When you build a big dam, that can have huge consequences for the people living along the banks of the river and people who make their living via subsistence fishing or farming along the river bank. A mega-dam can affect 50,000, even a 100,000 people.

What happens to the people displaced?

In some cases they may have to move. Or they may lose part of their land. In other cases, they may not be physically displaced but rather economically displaced because their livelihoods have been destroyed, or at least partly impacted.

If you make your living fishing from the river or along the coast, and a power plant or dam affects the ecosystem, there's fewer fish, and you're not catching as many. Then your livelihood and your ability to feed your family has been impacted.

The problem is that even resettlements that are done well and fairly often leave poor people even poorer. There's a lot of research that shows that people who are forced to move suffer higher rates of hunger, illness and early death. It causes really serious consequences for people.

You write about a land conservation project in Kenya. What went wrong there?

The land conservation project funneled money to the Kenyan forest service with the idea of preserving a forest in western Kenya. The problem is with the thousands of indigenous people — the Sengwer — living in the forest. Our reporting on the ground shows that hundreds, and perhaps as many as a thousand, homes have been burned by the Kenyan forest service as they try to evict people from the forest.

When you brought these cases to the World Bank's attention, how did they react?

Coronavirus:It may feel like 2008 all over again, but here's how this crisis is different

How bad is this drop vs. 2007-2009?

While the drop into a bear market over the past month is the fastest on record, the Standard & Poor’s 500 still hasn't fallen nearly as much as it did at its bottom in 2009, when it had plummeted 57% during the Great Recession. The index is off nearly 30% from its Feb. 19 high.

What has concerned investors is the swiftness of the latest leg down. It took just 16 trading days for the S&P 500 to plunge into a bear, defined as a 20% fall from a recent peak. That was nearly twice as fast as the stock market's topple into a bear in 1929, according to LPL Financial.

Has the bear slashed all the gains under Trump?

Stocks have lost most of those gains. As of Monday, the S&P 500 is up about 11.5% since Election Day on Nov. 8, 2016. At its high on February 19, it had gained nearly 60% from Election Day. The broad index is up just 5% since Trump’s inauguration, down from roughly 50% in mid February.

Are we in a recession?

Economists and analysts have raised their odds of an imminent downturn. Global supply shocks from the pandemic will likely drag the country into a recession as consumers and businesses cut spending, according to Goldman Sachs.

The U.S. economy will shrink 5% in the second quarter after zero gross domestic product growth in the first three months of the year, the bank’s economists wrote in a note Sunday.

To be sure, because the U.S. economy entered 2020 on a strong footing, economists forecast that this downturn will likely be shorter than the recession following the global financial crisis, which lasted 18 months. Goldman Sachs expects growth to rebound 3% and 4%, respectively, in the third and fourth quarters. For the full-year, their forecast was lowered to 0.4% growth, down from 1.2%.

Should you rebalance?

Wealth advisors have advice: Stay the course and remain calm. Cheaper stocks are a good thing for investors over a long-term horizon. Check in on your investments. Some of the recent weakness could serve as a buying opportunity.

“This will eventually pass,” says Julia Carlson, founder and CEO of Financial Freedom Wealth Management Group. “The risk-reward is still way better in stocks than bond funds over the long term. Sometimes we feel like we have to make a change in a situation like this, but if someone is appropriately diversified and they have the right strategy in place, the decision to stay the course is completely fine.”

If you feel like you can’t stomach the recent losses, you may need to readjust your allocations to make sure you’re invested for the long haul, experts say.

Should you refinance?

First-time homebuyers and refinancers are set to benefit as interest rates have fallen back to record lows, a move that will cut borrowing costs even further on mortgages.

The average fixed rate for a 30-year mortgage rose to 3.36% last week, that’s almost a full percentage point lower than 4.31% a year ago. The average rate on a 15-year mortgage slipped to 2.77% from 2.79% a year earlier.

“With interest rates at historic lows, anyone with a mortgage should be seriously considering refinancing,” says Tom Myers, CEO and Managing Partner at Bordeaux Wealth Advisors. “For anyone who doesn’t have one, they should consider obtaining one.”",www.usatoday.com,center,PYwDy1nvEj571U5i

Then there’s the economy. Taxes are so high that companies are running away from America. Take just the latest example, Burger King.

My CEO friends tell me virtually every billion-dollar company in America is plotting and planning the same escape. It’s a “jail break.” Everyone in corporate America wants out of Obama’s America.

As a result of all this terrible news, should it come as a surprise that consumers are in a foul mood? The latest polls show that Americans are “unhappy, worried and pessimistic.” That’s a bad combination.

Yet the stock market sits at all-time highs.

In the face of all of this, stock prices continue to rise to all-time heights, all based on one thing - the Federal Reserve being forced to keep printing fake money so Wall Street and stock investors can get rich on the misery of the rest of us.

Add it up. Delusion abounds. Investors are ignoring history. Danger signals are flashing like never before. America is in severe trouble. The middle class (consumers) is in shambles. But the stock market keeps just keeps rising to the heavens.

Wall Street ’ s record-breaking 11-year “ bull market ” came to an end on Wednesday as fears about the spreading Covid-19 pandemic hit stock markets again .
US stock markets have been on an unprecedented streak since 2009 , a bull market of gains . On Wednesday investors sold off shares across all sectors after the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic for the first time and criticized “ alarming levels of inaction ” by governments in corralling the virus .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down over 1,400 points , 5.8 % . After days of wild fluctuations , the Dow has now fallen 20 % from its most recent highs – finally signaling a bear market . The S & P 500 also fell and is now 19 % below its recent high .
The fall came as Donald Trump met with Wall Street ’ s most senior executives at the White House . It was the latest in a series of meetings the Trump administration has held as it works on a strategy to shore up the US economy .
Trump said : “ Prior to the coronavirus it was all go . The numbers were fantastic . Now we are hitting a patch . We are going to do something about getting rid of this virus as quickly as possible .
“ I think there will be a pent-up demand when this is gone , ” he said .

Wall Street’s record-breaking 11-year “bull market” came to an end on Wednesday as fears about the spreading Covid-19 pandemic hit stock markets again.

US stock markets have been on an unprecedented streak since 2009, a bull market of gains. On Wednesday investors sold off shares across all sectors after the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic for the first time and criticized “alarming levels of inaction” by governments in corralling the virus.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down over 1,400 points, 5.8%. After days of wild fluctuations, the Dow has now fallen 20% from its most recent highs – finally signaling a bear market. The S&P 500 also fell and is now 19% below its recent high.

The fall came as Donald Trump met with Wall Street’s most senior executives at the White House. It was the latest in a series of meetings the Trump administration has held as it works on a strategy to shore up the US economy.

banking_and_finance,The Hill,1,https://thehill.com/policy/finance/485656-fed-cuts-interest-rate-by-half-a-percentage-point,Fed cuts interest rate by half a percentage point amid coronavirus fears,2020-03-03,,"The Federal Reserve on Tuesday cut interest rates amid concern about the potential economic toll of the coronavirus outbreak .
The Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) , which sets Fed interest rates , announced it would cut its baseline rate range by 0.5 percentage points to a 1 to 1.25 percent spread .
“ The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong . However , the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity , ” the FOMC said Tuesday in a statement . “ In light of these risks and in support of achieving its maximum employment and price stability goals , the Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower the target range for the federal funds rate . ''
The Fed 's emergency cut is the first rate reduction issued in between FOMC meetings , where the moves are usually announced , since 2008 . Investors had bet on the Fed to cut rates by 0.5 percentage points by the end of the upcoming FOMC meeting from March 17 to 18 .
The Fed was under growing pressure from financial markets to cut rates after U.S. stocks plunged into a correction last week . While stocks rallied Monday , the full extent of the coronavirus ’ s economic damage is unknown , raising the risk of a recession .
`` The virus and the measures that are being taken to contain it will surely weigh on economic activity both here and abroad for some time , '' Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in a Tuesday press conference , citing the early toll of the disease on the travel , tourism and manufacturing industries .
`` In response , we have eased the stance of monetary policy to provide some more support to the economy , '' he said .
Even so , analysts have questioned whether a Fed rate cut could help negate the damage of widespread supply disruption caused by the outbreak and unique panic stirred by a health scare .
`` We do recognize that rate cut will not reduce the rate of infection , it wo n't fix a broken supply chain . We get that , '' Powell said Tuesday .
`` We do n't think we have all the answers , but we do believe that our action will provide a meaningful boost to the economy , '' he continued .
Powell said that while health policies are the ultimate solution to the economic risks driven by the coronavirus , a rate cut will `` avoid a tightening of financial conditions , which can weigh on activity , and it will help boost household and business confidence . ''
President Trump Donald John TrumpSanders poised for big Super Tuesday 5 things to watch on Super Tuesday Congress scrambles to finalize coronavirus funding , surveillance deals MORE had also boosted his long-running pressure on the Fed and Powell to cut interest rates amid the growing anxiety about the stock market 's steady dive and the potential harm to an otherwise resilient U.S. economy .

The call was convened by Powell and Mnuchin .","The Federal Reserve on Tuesday cut interest rates amid concern about the potential economic toll of the coronavirus outbreak.

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets Fed interest rates, announced it would cut its baseline rate range by 0.5 percentage points to a 1 to 1.25 percent spread.

“The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong. However, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity,” the FOMC said Tuesday in a statement. “In light of these risks and in support of achieving its maximum employment and price stability goals, the Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower the target range for the federal funds rate.""

The Fed's emergency cut is the first rate reduction issued in between FOMC meetings, where the moves are usually announced, since 2008. Investors had bet on the Fed to cut rates by 0.5 percentage points by the end of the upcoming FOMC meeting from March 17 to 18.

The Fed was under growing pressure from financial markets to cut rates after U.S. stocks plunged into a correction last week. While stocks rallied Monday, the full extent of the coronavirus’s economic damage is unknown, raising the risk of a recession.

""The virus and the measures that are being taken to contain it will surely weigh on economic activity both here and abroad for some time,"" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in a Tuesday press conference, citing the early toll of the disease on the travel, tourism and manufacturing industries.

""In response, we have eased the stance of monetary policy to provide some more support to the economy,"" he said.

Even so, analysts have questioned whether a Fed rate cut could help negate the damage of widespread supply disruption caused by the outbreak and unique panic stirred by a health scare.

""We do recognize that rate cut will not reduce the rate of infection, it won't fix a broken supply chain. We get that,"" Powell said Tuesday.

""We don't think we have all the answers, but we do believe that our action will provide a meaningful boost to the economy,"" he continued.

Powell said that while health policies are the ultimate solution to the economic risks driven by the coronavirus, a rate cut will ""avoid a tightening of financial conditions, which can weigh on activity, and it will help boost household and business confidence.""

President Trump Donald John TrumpSanders poised for big Super Tuesday 5 things to watch on Super Tuesday Congress scrambles to finalize coronavirus funding, surveillance deals MORE had also boosted his long-running pressure on the Fed and Powell to cut interest rates amid the growing anxiety about the stock market's steady dive and the potential harm to an otherwise resilient U.S. economy.

I went grocery shopping this weekend. Not just a quick stop to pick up a few things, but a cart-filling trip to replenish supplies at both my apartment and at my boyfriend’s.

I expected my grocery shopping to be part of a productive Sunday. But my plans for the day went awry when the trip put me on the verge of a panic attack. I’m naturally anxious, but woof—it was a rough afternoon.

If it’s been a while since you took a “typical” trip to the grocery store, you might find a different shopping experience than you might expect. Here are my recommendations for how you can prepare for the journey in the time of coronavirus.

Spend extra time organizing your list

If you’re going to the store where you usually shop, take a few extra moments to organize your list by department or aisle.

Your goal during this period of physical distancing should be to get in and out of the store as quickly as possible. It is not the time when you want to be criss-crossing the store because you walked right by that item you stuck onto the bottom of your list.

Designate one shopper

If you typically go to the store with your partner or kids, it’s time to fly solo. The fewer people who are in the store at one time means the easier it will be to stay at least six feet apart.

If you can complete your shopping for more than one household at a time, now’s the time to band together to do it. As I mentioned, I did the shopping for my house and my boyfriend’s house (and let me tell you, I’m making him go next time). You might be able to pick up items for your next-door neighbor or a friend who lives close by to minimize their travels.

You may have to wait to enter the store

You can stroll right into many grocery stores right now. But you might be surprised to find a line outside your store entrance if the staff is limiting the number of people who can shop at one time. Wait times can vary, but it’s best to expect you’ll have to wait. Think you can squeeze in your grocery run before your next Zoom call? W ait until after that meeting.

If the idea of making small talk in line to buy groceries makes you sweat, grab a pair of earphones on your way out the door.

Pay attention to cart sanitation processes

Some stores are having staff sanitize carts between shoppers. Some are still allowing you to wipe down your own. And some stores are out of sanitizing wipes altogether.

If you’re not sure what the deal is at your store, ask an employee—you’re sure to find a few near the entrance.

Don’t expect people to stand far enough apart

Grocery aisles do not have a reputation for being spacious. It’s hard enough to keep physical distance from others everywhere you go, but it’s even more difficult when someone is standing in front of the chicken display for what feels like an eternity.

Do your best to be patient and avoid getting close to anyone. But also be forgiving if someone invades your personal space—scolding is only going to raise tensions further. They probably got distracted by their own grocery list and forgot that things aren’t normal anymore.

Simply step aside gracefully, if you can.

Expect the store to be out of a lot of items

My grocery store was out of eggs, toilet paper, and most types of bread.

I anticipated those items to be out of stock. But every single type of pasta? Mustard?

Go into your grocery trip expecting many shelf areas to be empty. Many of them will be restocked within hours, but the odds are high that you’ll leave the store without getting every single item on your list.

Plan for back-up items

Mustard aside, there’s a good chance you’ll be able to get what you need, even if it isn’t your first choice. If you’re just shopping for yourself, it’s easy to adjust when the grocery store is out of your favorite brand or flavor of a product. But if you’re shopping for anyone else, like a partner, child or neighbor, ask them this important question: “If they’re out of that kind, is there another option you prefer?”

You might argue that this isn’t a time to be picky. But if you’re someone who would normally stop in the grocery aisle and send a text to ask, “They’re out of Cocoa Pebbles, what do you want?” preparing some alternatives before you venture out to the store can help you reduce your shopping time. It can also help set expectations for the folks who stayed home.

Expect new bagging rules

If you usually bring your own reusable bags, you might find your store won’t use them right now. If you typically bag your own groceries, this is less likely to impact you. The virus isn’t known to survive very long on soft items like tote bags, but some stores that usually have baggers have been offering paper or plastic only in an effort to reduce the items store employees have to touch.",www.lifehacker.com,center,DPRzIefh8E9UbERr

After an initial steep fall of nearly 300 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average benchmark is now at 16,702 — a drop of 203 points, or about 1.2 percent. The NASDAQ Composite index is at 4,739 — about 2 percent lower than its opening level.

Our original post continues:

Hours before the U.S. markets opened, stock futures for the Dow Jones index were sharply down, by more than 380 points. Futures for Brazil's Bovespa index were down 850 points.

By midday in Europe, large indexes in Britain and France had fallen by nearly 3 percent and Germany's benchmark DAX index dropped by more than 3.5 percent. Those indexes were seeing their lowest points in three or more months.

The rough start to 2016 is being blamed on several factors.

China's central bank has let its currency weaken to a near five-year low; Chinese investors say there are problems with how the ""circuit breaker"" is being used — that it robs them of a chance to lift the markets back up; and analysts say officials aren't releasing enough information about the mechanism and China's policies.

The rearchers say part of the trouble is that many employers that offer 401 ( k ) plans to their workers are outgunned by financial firms that sell them bad plans loaded with hefty fees . That 's especially true , they say , for small and midsize employers that do n't have much financial expertise in-house .
At a manufacturing firm in Minnesota , Justin Johnson , a new employee , is enrolling in the 401 ( k ) plan . He has two kids , and his fiancee is going back to school . Money is tight , but he wants to save for the future .
He 's on the phone with a financial adviser that the small company , named MITGI , uses to walk people through the process . The adviser did n't want to do a recorded interview , but he let us join in on the speakerphone call when we visited the company to report our story . `` So what are the fees like in this plan ? '' Johnson asks the adviser . It 's an important question because high fees can badly damage your ability to make money over time .
The fees in this retirement plan make it `` extremely competitive , '' says the financial adviser , who is with EFS Advisors in Cambridge , Minn. That sounds good . But it does n't appear to be true . Federal disclosure documents show the fees are more than three times higher than other plans available to employees at companies like this one , according to Ian Ayres , a law professor at Yale Law School .
`` He misrepresented the truth , '' says Ayres , who studies 401 ( k ) plans . We asked Ayres if making such a claim is even legal . `` No , '' he says , `` to misrepresent the truth in that way is almost certainly not legal . ''
Ayres says MITGI got saddled with a bad set of investment options that 's taking way too much out of the workers ' savings . And he has seen this before . Ayres has analyzed 401 ( k ) plans at thousands of companies across the country . `` Sadly , the high-costness is both outrageous and all too prevalent , '' he says . `` There are billions of dollars in excess fees being charged each year to American workers . '' And , Ayres says , smaller companies are more likely to have overpriced 401 ( k ) plans .
The problem is that many people running small and midsized companies are not very good at setting up 401 ( k ) plans for their workers . And that 's somewhat understandable . They do n't know much about saving and investing . They 're in business because they 're really good at other things .
`` We make tools that are smaller than a human hair in diameter , '' says Eric Lipke , the president of MITGI , which stands for Midwest Industrial Tool Grinding Inc .
The Hutchinson , Minn. , company manufactures tiny drill bit-type tools used to make pacemakers and other medical devices . Lipke oversees the company 's 55 employees . And he says the firm wants to offer good benefits so it can attract and keep good workers .
`` To come and work here for 20 years , 30 years , whatever their working career is , and when they 're done be able to say , 'You know , I had really good health care , I have a great retirement plan , ' `` Lipke says .
But five years ago , when he went to set up the 401 ( k ) plan , nobody at this company knew anything about how to do it . Lipke needed help . He asked business people running other local companies if they knew a good financial adviser . Somebody recommended this one with EFS Advisors , who said he could set up a good plan for the workers . `` We chose him and he did set up the plan , and all but one employee participated right away from the beginning , '' Lipke says . `` So it was something people liked . ''
But Lipke realized he still has no idea whether he ended up with a good 401 ( k ) plan for the workers . `` We do n't have a really good benchmark to know how good it is or not , '' he says . `` We do n't know where to find help for that . ''
So , as part of this NPR series `` Your Money and Your Life , '' we found Lipke some help . We put him and his new human resources director , Sheila Murphy , in touch with another professor who studies all this , Kent Smetters , an economist at the University of Pennsylvania 's Wharton School .
Smetters studies 401 ( k ) plans and does a personal finance radio show . We asked him to take a look at MITGI 's plan , including fee disclosures and other details . Murphy and Lipke then called him and asked him basically whether their plan was good , bad or ugly .
`` I would put it between bad and ugly , '' Smetters told them .
`` I think I 've seen worse but not by much , '' Smetters said . `` This really is a high-fee plan . ''
The disclosure documents for the plan show that the workers at the company are paying about 2 percent in fees . That might not sound like much . But Smetters says it 's really high .
Two percent of your entire life savings every year , compounded over long periods of time — 30 or 40 years — eats up half the earnings on the money you invest . So Smetters says this plan is sucking way too much money out of the employees ' pockets . But , he says , `` the good news here is there 's a great opportunity here for shifting to a 401 ( k ) plan '' that will deliver a higher return over time .
As for EFS Advisors , the firm declined repeated requests for an interview or a comment . But Sarah Holden , a research director with the trade group the Investment Company Institute , says studies finding that many 401 ( k ) plans are overpriced have focused primarily on fees . But , she says , `` what none of the studies have done is look to see what was the range of services that were being included . ''
So , for example , one plan might cost more than another , but employees might get more access to financial advisers in the more expensive plan . Of course , many plans could still be way overpriced . But Holden says basically businesses need to shop around .
`` It 's their job '' , she says , to make sure that the fees they 're paying for the services they 're getting `` are reasonable . ''
When he spoke with the managers at MITGI , the Wharton School 's Smetters suggested a few reputable financial firms for them to contact that might have plans with competitive prices .
Smetters says MITGI made the same mistake that many other businesses and individuals do . Many people find a financial adviser just by asking friends for a recommendation . This is what we humans do , right ? Anybody know a good plumber ? Anybody know a good financial adviser ?
But Smetters says this is not the best approach . Somebody who has `` financial adviser '' written on a business card , often `` he 's not only a financial adviser , '' Smetters says . `` He 's also a sales guy who is recommending that your 401 ( k ) plan use funds that have high expense ratios because that 's how he ultimately gets paid . ''
That 's why Smetters says he recommends that people and businesses only use what are known as `` fee-only '' advisers . By law , a `` fee-only '' adviser must place your interests first and not accept hidden commissions from mutual funds , insurance companies or anyone else . In other words , they do n't get kickbacks for steering you into high-cost mutual funds .
Murphy , the HR director , has now heard back after shopping around for a better deal for the workers at MITGI . She contacted three financial firms , and one , a major firm , gave her a quote for a plan with total fees of 0.64 percent .

Americans collectively are losing billions of dollars a year out of their retirement accounts because they're paying excessive fees, according to researchers studying thousands of employer-sponsored retirement plans across the country.

A Pattern Of Excessive Fees

Ayres says MITGI got saddled with a bad set of investment options that's taking way too much out of the workers' savings. And he has seen this before. Ayres has analyzed 401(k) plans at thousands of companies across the country. ""Sadly, the high-costness is both outrageous and all too prevalent,"" he says.

The problem is that many people running small and midsized companies are not very good at setting up 401(k) plans for their workers. And that's somewhat understandable. They don't know much about saving and investing. They're in business because they're really good at other things.

Between Bad And Ugly

Smetters studies 401(k) plans and does a personal finance radio show. We asked him to take a look at MITGI's plan, including fee disclosures and other details. Murphy and Lipke then called him and asked him basically whether their plan was good, bad or ugly.

""I would put it between bad and ugly,"" Smetters told them.

""Oh!"" said Murphy, dismayed.

""I think I've seen worse but not by much,"" Smetters said. ""This really is a high-fee plan.""

Shopping Around

When he spoke with the managers at MITGI, the Wharton School's Smetters suggested a few reputable financial firms for them to contact that might have plans with competitive prices.

Smetters says MITGI made the same mistake that many other businesses and individuals do. Many people find a financial adviser just by asking friends for a recommendation. This is what we humans do, right? Anybody know a good plumber? Anybody know a good financial adviser?

At the same time , Russia and Saudi Arabia flooded the world with excess supply .
That double black swan has caused oil prices to collapse to levels that make it impossible for US shale oil companies to make money . US crude for May delivery turned negative on Monday -- something that has never happened since NYMEX oil futures began trading in 1983 . It was easily the oil market 's worst day on record .
US crude for June delivery is still trading above $ 20 a barrel — but even that 's disastrous .
`` $ 30 is already quite bad , but once you get to $ 20 or even $ 10 , it 's a complete nightmare , '' said Artem Abramov , head of shale research at Rystad Energy .
Many oil companies took on too much debt during the good times . Some of them wo n't be able to survive this historic downturn .
In a $ 20 oil environment , 533 US oil exploration and production companies will file for bankruptcy by the end of 2021 , according to Rystad Energy . At $ 10 , there would be more than 1,100 bankruptcies , Rystad estimates .
`` At $ 10 , almost every US E & P company that has debt will have to file Chapter 11 or consider strategic opportunities , '' Abramov said .
The most stunning part of the record low in oil prices is that it comes after Russia and Saudi Arabia agreed to end their epic price war after President Donald Trump intervened . OPEC+ agreed to cut oil production by a record amount .
Trump said the OPEC+ agreement would save countless jobs and much-needed stability to the oil patch .
`` This will save hundreds of thousands of energy jobs in the United States , '' Trump tweeted on April 12 . `` I would like to thank and congratulate President Putin of Russia and King Salman of Saudi Arabia . ''
Yet crude has kept crashing , in part because those production cuts do n't kick in until May . And demand continues to vanish because jets , cars and factories are sidelined by the coronavirus pandemic .
The hope in the oil industry is that Monday 's negative prices are somewhat of a fluke caused by the rolling over futures contracts .
The record low in the May contract comes on very thin trading volume ahead of Tuesday 's expiration . That 's because there are concerns that there will be no room to store those barrels delivered in May . The June contract , however , only dropped around 10 % to $ 22 a barrel . And Brent crude , the world benchmark , fell just 5 % to $ 26.50 a barrel .
Still , oil contracts roll over each month and they do n't crash to record lows .
`` There will be a lot of companies that do n't survive this downturn , '' said Ryan Fitzmaurice , energy strategist at Rabobank . `` This is one of the worst on record . ''

The key will be how long oil prices stay dirt cheap . A rapid rebound in prices could allow many oil companies to avoid bankruptcy .
Buddy Clark , co-chair of the energy practice at Houston law firm Haynes and Boone , said his firm is `` extremely busy '' working on potential oil bankruptcies . Haynes and Boone has been forced to pull lawyers from other areas of the firm to work on the oil problem .
`` I do n't think I 've seen anything like it in my lifetime . It 's unprecedented , '' said Clark , who started working in the industry in 1982 .
Clark thinks that despite the further collapse in prices , there will still be only — `` only '' — 100 oil bankruptcies in 2020 .
`` It 's hard to believe that 100 bankruptcies is the optimistic view . That just shows you where we are , '' Clark said .
There would probably be more bankruptcies already if it were n't for the extreme volatility in oil prices . Clark said companies are having trouble drawing up restructuring plans because they do n't know what the price of the commodity will be .
`` Ironically , the lower price has slowed down the process , '' Clark said . `` A number of companies may have teed up filings but they need to go back to the drawing board . ''
The dire outlook in the oil industry will make it very difficult for companies attempting to reorganize in Chapter 11 proceedings to get the required financing and support . Debtholders who would normally swap their debt for equity may not want that equity .

Chesapeake Energy CHK Oasis Petroleum OAS Rystad 's Abramov said `` no one would be surprised '' ifandwere forced to consider bankruptcy .
Chesapeake recently suspended dividend payments on preferred stock . Its stock price crashed so low that it turned to a one-for-200 reverse stock split to comply with exchange requirements .

Although American frackers rebounded from the 2014-2016 oil crash , there are concerns the shale industry could be permanently scarred .
Investors were already tired of the industry 's horrible returns following years of excessive spending and oversupply . And that was before the great oil crash of 2020 .","The coronavirus pandemic has caused oil demand to drop so rapidly that the world is running out of room to store barrels .

OPEC cuts failed to end the panic

The most stunning part of the record low in oil prices is that it comes after Russia and Saudi Arabia agreed to end their epic price war after President Donald Trump intervened. OPEC+ agreed to cut oil production by a record amount.

Trump said the OPEC+ agreement would save countless jobs and much-needed stability to the oil patch.

""This will save hundreds of thousands of energy jobs in the United States,"" Trump tweeted on April 12. ""I would like to thank and congratulate President Putin of Russia and King Salman of Saudi Arabia.""

Yet crude has kept crashing, in part because those production cuts don't kick in until May. And demand continues to vanish because jets, cars and factories are sidelined by the coronavirus pandemic.

The hope in the oil industry is that Monday's negative prices are somewhat of a fluke caused by the rolling over futures contracts.

The record low in the May contract comes on very thin trading volume ahead of Tuesday's expiration. That's because there are concerns that there will be no room to store those barrels delivered in May. The June contract, however, only dropped around 10% to $22 a barrel.

'Unprecedented' stress in the oil industry

Signs of stress abound in the oil patch.

The S&P 500's energy sector has lost more than 40% of its value this year — despite the dramatic rebound in the overall stock market over the past month.

Noble Energy NBL Halliburton HAL Marathon Oil MRO Occidental OXY ExxonMobil XOM andhave all lost more than two-thirds of their value. Even Dow memberis down 38%.

Whiting Petroleum became the first domino to fall when the former shale star filed for Chapter 11 protection on April 2. But it certainly won't be the last.

Rystad's $20 scenario predicts more than $70 billion of oil company debt will get reorganized in bankruptcy, followed by $177 billion in 2021. And that only accounts for exploration and production companies, not the servicing industry that provides the tools and manpower to drillers.

The key will be how long oil prices stay dirt cheap. A rapid rebound in prices could allow many oil companies to avoid bankruptcy.

Buddy Clark, co-chair of the energy practice at Houston law firm Haynes and Boone, said his firm is ""extremely busy"" working on potential oil bankruptcies. Haynes and Boone has been forced to pull lawyers from other areas of the firm to work on the oil problem.

""I don't think I've seen anything like it in my lifetime. It's unprecedented,"" said Clark, who started working in the industry in 1982.

""It's hard to believe that 100 bankruptcies is the optimistic view. That just shows you where we are,"" Clark said.

Liquidations could be on the way

There would probably be more bankruptcies already if it weren't for the extreme volatility in oil prices. Clark said companies are having trouble drawing up restructuring plans because they don't know what the price of the commodity will be.

""Ironically, the lower price has slowed down the process,"" Clark said. ""A number of companies may have teed up filings but they need to go back to the drawing board.""

""Those with strong balance sheets will be able to take advantage of the situation,"" said Morrison.

However, he noted the supermajors will be ""cautious about pulling the trigger"" in the next six months because they must defend their coveted dividends first.

The next dominoes?

The oil crash has set off a guessing game about which companies will be next to succumb to bankruptcy. The most vulnerable companies are the ones that piled on too much debt, face looming debt maturities and can't generate cash flow to even make their interest payments.

Chesapeake Energy CHK Oasis Petroleum OAS Rystad's Abramov said ""no one would be surprised"" ifandwere forced to consider bankruptcy.

Chesapeake recently suspended dividend payments on preferred stock. Its stock price crashed so low that it turned to a one-for-200 reverse stock split to comply with exchange requirements.

Shale driller Oasis has lost more than 90% of its value this year. Its stock is trading below 30 cents.

Although American frackers rebounded from the 2014-2016 oil crash, there are concerns the shale industry could be permanently scarred.

Investors were already tired of the industry's horrible returns following years of excessive spending and oversupply. And that was before the great oil crash of 2020.",www.cnn.com,left,wTttlMxRBUrK6qpF

NEW YORK — In 2009 , Washington went to war against big Wall Street banks hoping to blow up the kind of high-risk , high-reward strategies that helped spark the financial crisis . Five years later , that war is largely over . And Washington won in a blowout .
You might not know it given continued demands from Democrats — and even some Republicans — to further bust up the nation ’ s largest banks . And the standard media refrain is that Wall Street titans always win , no big bank bosses went to jail and the industry will just find new ways to keep the casino open .
But the truth on the ground — at least at this moment in time — is very different .
Goldman Sachs , the biggest money machine in Wall Street history , is a shell of its former self . Morgan Stanley , Goldman ’ s one-time bitter rival in the swashbuckling world of high-risk trading , is transforming into a staid money management firm with a side business underwriting stocks and offering merger advice .
Citigroup and Bank of America sold off many of their classic “ Wall Street ” businesses , including proprietary trading desks and private equity and hedge fund stakes , to comply with the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill .
Washington ’ s big victory came via widespread public outrage at the financial industry , which paved the way for a strong reform bill . And after President Barack Obama signed Dodd-Frank into law in 2010 , the industry made mistake after mistake — from the interest rate rigging scandal to mortgage-foreclosure “ robo-signing ” — making it essentially impossible for the industry ’ s lobbyists to beat back any of the newly imposed regulations .
“ The scope of activities that U.S. banks engage in has been dramatically reduced , ” said Mohamed A. El-Erian , chief executive of giant bond fund manager Pimco , which itself may face new restrictions as regulators turn their attention to the asset management industry . “ Even in a period when markets are performing well , the numbers the banks are pulling in are just nowhere near as strong as they once were . ”
Even mighty JPMorgan Chase , once viewed as the only bank to come through the crisis largely unchanged , is now forking over tens of billions of dollars in settlement cash , seemingly on a weekly basis , to pay for its sins before the financial crisis — including allegedly turning a blind eye to the Bernie Madoff fraud and improperly selling risky mortgage securities . JPMorgan this week gave up its coveted title as the nation ’ s most profitable bank to Wells Fargo , a buttoned down San Francisco-based bank not known as a Wall Street titan .
And JPMorgan ’ s massive $ 6 billion loss in the so-called London whale trading scandal in 2012 helped ensure that a very tough version of the ban on proprietary trading by federally backstopped banks — known as the “ Volcker rule ” — was approved by regulators last month .
The transformation of Wall Street is so complete that even some of the industry ’ s loudest critics — rarely willing to give an inch — are prepared to declare at least partial victory , albeit with plenty of “ time will tell ” caveats and complaints about the industry pushing to underfund its regulators in the latest spending bill working its way through Congress .
“ There is no question that many of the highest-risk activities , which happened to be the most profitable activities for Wall Street , are now at least reduced and often totally gone , ” said Dennis Kelleher , chief executive of Better Markets , one of the most vocal pro-regulatory reform groups . “ They ’ ve had to exit hedge funds and private equity funds and they sold off any business with ‘ proprietary trading ’ on the door . ”
Those sales in part benefit smaller boutique investment banks not subject to the new rules as well as pure hedge fund and private equity firms that can snap up assets from the bigger players at low prices . It also means young talent now flows toward higher-paying private equity and hedge funds rather than the now more staid banks . Both Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse in recent months pitched themselves by saying junior staff should no longer come to the office on Saturdays , a hallmark of the old Wall Street .
In fact , perhaps the clearest example of the transformation is Goldman , which on Thursday reported a 15 percent fourth-quarter drop in net revenue in its once dominant fixed income , currency and commodities business to $ 1.72 billion . For the year , Goldman earned a total of profit of $ 8.04 billion .
In 2007 , at the height of the last Wall Street boom , Goldman ’ s trading wizards earned $ 4.89 billion in net revenue in the same business in the third quarter . And for the year in 2007 , Goldman reported earnings of nearly $ 12 billion .
To be sure , some of the drop in trading and other revenue at big Wall Street banks reflects a slower economy and less risk-taking by corporate clients . But it also reflects the fact that under Dodd-Frank , the Volcker rule and new capital requirements instituted by the Federal Reserve and other regulators , Wall Street banks can not trade for their own accounts the way they once did , must maintain much less risky balance sheets and for the most part can no longer sell exotic and high-return products such as collateralized debt or loan obligations .
The result of all this is that Wall Street is struggling to make money .
“ There are only two banks beating their cost of capital right now , JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs , and neither are beating it by much , ” said Brad Hintz , a banking analyst at Sanford Bernstein and a former top executive at Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers . He was referring to how much it costs a bank to make money for shareholders . “ New regulations are pushing down the performance of the banks . At some point they will get restructured , but right now they are in a major period of transition . ”
Hintz pointed to Morgan Stanley ’ s current effort to sell off its commodities business as evidence of the deep transformation of Wall Street . Indeed , Morgan Stanley , under chief executive James Gorman , a veteran of Merrill Lynch ’ s giant brokerage business , is moving away from high-risk trading toward a much more stable asset management business .
The changes are not limited to Goldman and Morgan Stanley .
Citigroup has been selling off hedge fund and private equity assets to comply with the Volcker rule . Bank of America chief executive Brian Moynihan said last month that closing trading businesses banned under Volcker cost the bank $ 500 million in revenue per quarter .
None of these banks are going broke anytime soon , of course .
BofA reported earnings of $ 3.44 billion in the fourth quarter . JPMorgan earned $ 5.3 billion . But much of the gains are now coming from cost-cutting , including lowering salaries and bonuses , and from reducing reserves held for soured loans .
Because the economy is improving and consumers are in much better shape than they were five years ago , banks now have to keep less cash on hand to cushion against losses . Around 31 percent of JPMorgan ’ s profits in 2013 , or $ 5.6 billion , came from reduced loan-loss reserves , according to Bloomberg .
Bank share prices have also done well since the depths of the crisis , but analysts note that much of that stems from reduced expenses as well as a general hope among investors that an improving economy will increase demand for loans and banking services , driving future profits .
Still , no one in the industry expects the kind of eye-popping returns that the largest banks earned in the run-up to the financial crisis . And the industry ’ s defenders say the public perception — that banks remain too big to fail and have not been reformed — is not at all fair .
“ To say nothing has changed is just crazy talk , ” said Tony Fratto , partner at Hamilton Place Strategies , a D.C. consulting firm working with banks on image repair . “ There have been very significant changes . Banks raised lots of new capital , they face a host of new oversight powers and we are stress-testing them to the point that nothing else in the world will survive except these banks . ”
Lobbyists for the big banks say they are now fighting just to avoid being broken up as vocal members of Congress , including Sens . Elizabeth Warren ( D-Mass . ) and David Vitter ( R-La . ) , call for banks to be forced out of the investment banking business entirely .

WASHINGTON — The Republican-led Senate narrowly voted Tuesday to repeal a banking rule that would let consumers band together to sue their bank or credit card company to resolve financial disputes.

Vice President Pence cast the final vote to break a 50-50 tie. The banking industry had been lobbying hard to roll back the regulation from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The bureau had moved to ban most types of mandatory arbitration clauses found in the fine print of agreements consumers often enter into when opening a checking account or getting a credit card.

The vote reflects the effort of the Trump administration and congressional Republicans to undo regulations that the GOP argues harms the free market. The measure now moves to President Donald Trump’s desk for his signature.

Democratic lawmakers said the rule was needed and would give consumers more leverage to stop companies from financial wrongdoing. They cited the sales practices at Wells Fargo and the security breach at credit company Equifax as examples of misdeeds protected through forced arbitration.

“So who does forced arbitration help? Wall Street banks and other huge corporations that never pay the price for cheating working people,” said Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio.

Republicans said that the arbitration system has worked “wonderfully” for consumers. They said the payouts for the average consumer in arbitration cases are generally much larger and occur much more quickly than compared to the relief gained through class-action lawsuits.

“The effort to try to characterize this as some devious system that has been created to try to stop consumers from having access to fairness is simply false,” said Sen. Mike Crapo, the Republican chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. “We have a very fair system that has been working for over 100 years in this country.”

Crapo said the average pay-out for consumers in class-action lawsuits against financial companies was just $32, but lawyers stood to make millions.

“This is a rule to benefit the plaintiff’s bar,” Crapo said.

Democrats argued that consumers generally don’t have the time and means to pursue claims in arbitration, and since most disputes revolve around small amounts, they typically just give up. They said banks and other financial firms know that, in the end, they won’t have pay a real price for taking advantage of a consumer.

The advocacy group Consumers Union and several veterans groups, including the American Legion, lobbied to keep the rule. They said consumers would still have the option to use arbitration to resolve a dispute, if both parties want to go that route.

“Giving the consumer a genuine choice also means the lender has the incentive to make sure the alternative is fair and workable, so that informed consumers will have a reason to choose it,” said George Glover, senior policy counsel for Consumers Union.

In late April Marko Kolanovic , a financial analyst for JPMorgan Chase , wrote to clients with good news . Pandemic aside , investors should expect stock prices in S & P 500 companies to return to record numbers some time early next year !
“ The S & P 500 should attain previous all-time highs , ” Kolanovic wrote , “ if the monetary measures are sustained . ”
The key part of this phrase was the last bit , “ if the monetary measures are sustained. ” In countries that did not have a Federal Reserve Bank shooting a bazooka of cash daily at Wall Street , Kolanovic suggested the coronavirus would result in a 30 percent decline in the present value of earnings .
In other words , without intervention by the Federal Reserve , the United States in the coronavirus era would be looking at a Depression-level contraction .
Assuming the Fed bazooka keeps firing , however , a large portion of the investor class is already on a road leading back to champagne and confetti . And that , as Robert Frost would say , has made all the difference .
On the road more traveled , on the real side of the coronavirus economy , the pain has been historic . As of this writing , 30 million people have filed jobless claims during the COVID-19 crisis , and millions have lost their employer-based insurance .
At least one in three can ’ t make their rent , millions more can ’ t afford groceries , and workers in supermarkets , medical clinics , warehouses , and other professions are now in a macabre race to see if they ’ ll turn blue and die before corporate employers decide to slash their salaries or retirement benefits — which has already happened to front-line caregivers in some cities .
There are no projections of record earnings in the futures of such people . The best case is survival , and the grim reality of diminished economic horizons . Yet for the tiny sliver of people whose fortunes depend not on salaries , tips , and commissions , but upon the prices of financial products like stocks and bonds , the coronavirus response heralds a brave new world .
The $ 2.3 trillion CARES Act , the Donald Trump-led rescue package signed into law on March 27th , is a radical rethink of American capitalism . It retains all the cruelties of the free market for those who live and work in the real world , but turns the paper economy into a state protectorate , surrounded by a kind of Trumpian Money Wall that is designed to keep the investor class safe from fear of loss .
This financial economy is a fantasy casino , where the winnings are real but free chips cover the losses . For a rarefied segment of society , failure is being written out of the capitalist bargain .
This is a fresh take on a long-developing dynamic . Dating to the late Eighties , when then-Fed-chief Alan Greenspan slashed interest rates after the 1987 stock-market crash , there ’ s been an understanding that the government would be there to help Wall Street back on its feet in hard times .
That belief was so strong it had a name : the “ Greenspan put. ” Bloomberg ’ s Tim Duy defines the term as “ the implied promise that central bankers led by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan would bail out market participants who indulged in risky behavior . ”
The Fed stepped in to flood Wall Street with cash ( these are called “ liquidity injections ” ) after a series of messes in the Clinton and Bush years , from the Asian-currency debacle to the collapse of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund in the late Nineties to a deflation panic in 2002 .
A prolonged period of liquidity injection in the early 2000s prompted a now-familiar pattern of pushing investors out of traditional safe-haven investments ( the low interest rates punished savers ) and into ever-riskier gambles in commodities , stocks , and the housing markets .
All three arenas saw bubbles , but the one in the U.S. housing market burst after an orgy of Ponzi-style scheming sent mortgage prices shooting through the roof . In the space of a few months in 2008 , the pension funds and municipalities that had been urged by greed-sick bankers to invest in a “ real estate boom ” ( actually a fraud-driven speculative bubble ) lost fortunes .
Taxpayers and homeowners bore nearly 100 percent of the pain . Nearly 3 million people filed for foreclosure in 2010 alone . Back then , the notion of using state funds to rescue these folks was rejected as laughable , a dangerous “ moral hazard. ” As billionaire Charlie Munger put it in 2010 , homeowners needed to “ suck it in and cope , ” and not wait for a handout .
Wall Street , though , got the mother of all rescues . The response wasn ’ t limited to a traditional liquidity injection . Banks were given trillions in bailouts and emergency loans , allowed to dump years of bad investment decisions into special garbage facilities set up by the Federal Reserve , and urged to “ drink themselves sober ” through years of free money from a zero-interest-rate policy .
The Fed , beginning in late 2008 , added a new crisis-response tool called quantitative easing ( QE ) , a fancy academic name for printing trillions of dollars and using it to buy everything from mortgages to government debt . This was with the ostensible aim of increasing “ the availability of credit ” for things like home purchases , but also to “ foster improved conditions in financial markets more generally . ”
The dubious underlying logic was that rescuing the economy and rescuing the financial markets were the same thing . To save people , we had to save the economy in which they operate , which meant saving the high-risk investments of Wall Streeters , as much as they might suck .
What ’ s happening in the COVID-19 crisis is the next step : a financial bubble where the Fed isn ’ t the cleanup mechanism , but the source of the mania itself . While the real economy is seeing record disruptions , Wall Street has seen prolonged rallies of “ rational exuberance ” over the Fed ’ s decision to usher in “ QE infinity ” and essentially ban losing in finance capitalism .
Though this is a Trump bill — El Pompadour is so determined that the CARES Act be remembered as his work , he fought to get his signature on relief checks — it passed unanimously , by voice vote in the House , and 96-0 in the Senate .
Talk to Democrats on the Hill and they will tell you this is a bailout to be cheered and supported , nothing like the 2008 rescue . This time is different , the argument goes : Three-quarters of the money goes to real people .
This is true , if one squints and uses a narrow definition of “ money. ” The $ 2.3 trillion imagines $ 560 billion for “ individuals ” ( including $ 300 billion in cash payments , much by way of the famed $ 1,200 “ Trump ” checks ) , plus $ 377 billion for small businesses , as well as $ 339 billion for state and local governments , and $ 100 billion for hospitals and other health care providers , plus some aid for students and children .
Technically , “ only ” about $ 500 billion of the congressionally passed rescue package goes to “ big business. ” Moreover , the big-business aid ostensibly comes with a range of draconian-sounding conditions barring greedy hijinks , meaning no layoffs , no stock buybacks , no big bonuses , etc. , if companies want the handout .
The loophole comes via $ 454 billion created as part of that big-business package . This “ emergency fund ” will be dumped into a “ special-purpose vehicle ” used to backstop further lending by the Federal Reserve .
That $ 454 billion is designed to grow by a factor of 10 or more . “ We can lever up to $ 4 trillion , ” said Steve Mnuchin , playing the “ free-spending Goldman Sachs-trained Treasury secretary ” role that apparently is a prerequisite for financial-disaster narratives in modern America .
Democrats early on expressed concern about old-school Tammany Hall-style graft , i.e. , that the fund would be used to invest in businesses with connections . “ We ’ re not here to create a slush fund for Donald Trump and his family , ” is how Elizabeth Warren put it .
However , once Democrats won superficial oversight concessions ( including the creation of a Congressional Oversight Commission ) , Warren and everyone else in the caucus approved the “ slush fund ” concept , despite the far more radical issues it poses than individual graft .
The CARES Act “ slush fund ” imagines a future in which markets for all financial products are stressed , perhaps permanently , by lockdowns . In place of a heartless free market of panicked investors who might want to cut their losses and sell , the plan is to simulate real buying and selling of financial products like mortgages and bonds with directed deployments of the Fed ’ s endless trillions .

In late April Marko Kolanovic, a financial analyst for JPMorgan Chase, wrote to clients with good news. Pandemic aside, investors should expect stock prices in S&P 500 companies to return to record numbers some time early next year!

“The S&P 500 should attain previous all-time highs,” Kolanovic wrote, “if the monetary measures are sustained.”

The key part of this phrase was the last bit, “if the monetary measures are sustained.” In countries that did not have a Federal Reserve Bank shooting a bazooka of cash daily at Wall Street, Kolanovic suggested the coronavirus would result in a 30 percent decline in the present value of earnings.

In other words, without intervention by the Federal Reserve, the United States in the coronavirus era would be looking at a Depression-level contraction.

Assuming the Fed bazooka keeps firing, however, a large portion of the investor class is already on a road leading back to champagne and confetti. And that, as Robert Frost would say, has made all the difference.

On the road more traveled, on the real side of the coronavirus economy, the pain has been historic. As of this writing, 30 million people have filed jobless claims during the COVID-19 crisis, and millions have lost their employer-based insurance.

At least one in three can’t make their rent, millions more can’t afford groceries, and workers in supermarkets, medical clinics, warehouses, and other professions are now in a macabre race to see if they’ll turn blue and die before corporate employers decide to slash their salaries or retirement benefits — which has already happened to front-line caregivers in some cities.

There are no projections of record earnings in the futures of such people. The best case is survival, and the grim reality of diminished economic horizons. Yet for the tiny sliver of people whose fortunes depend not on salaries, tips, and commissions, but upon the prices of financial products like stocks and bonds, the coronavirus response heralds a brave new world.

The $2.3 trillion CARES Act, the Donald Trump-led rescue package signed into law on March 27th, is a radical rethink of American capitalism. It retains all the cruelties of the free market for those who live and work in the real world, but turns the paper economy into a state protectorate, surrounded by a kind of Trumpian Money Wall that is designed to keep the investor class safe from fear of loss.

This financial economy is a fantasy casino, where the winnings are real but free chips cover the losses. For a rarefied segment of society, failure is being written out of the capitalist bargain.

This is a fresh take on a long-developing dynamic. Dating to the late Eighties, when then-Fed-chief Alan Greenspan slashed interest rates after the 1987 stock-market crash, there’s been an understanding that the government would be there to help Wall Street back on its feet in hard times.

Javier Martin-Artajo and Julien Grout charged in case

Charges focus on derivatives trading in bank%27s London office in 2012

Suspects allegedly manipulated records to hide hundreds of millions of dollars in trading

NEW YORK — Two former JPMorgan Chase traders Wednesday became the first suspects hit with criminal allegations for allegedly hiding massive trading losses in the $6.2 billion ""London whale"" disaster.

In a newly forceful action against Wall Street, federal prosecutors and securities regulators filed charges against Javier Martin-Artajo, 49, a former JPMorgan Chase managing director and trading supervisor in the global bank's London office, and Julien Grout, 35, another former trader there. The ex-employees, were charged with conspiracy, falsifying books and records, wire fraud and making false filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

CRIMINAL CASE:Complaint against Martin-Artajo

CRIMINAL CASE:Complaint against Grout

SEC FILING:Complaint against ex-Morgan traders

""The defendants' alleged lies misled investors, regulators and the public, and they constituted federal crimes,"" said Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. Invoking the same phrase bank CEO Jaime Dimon used last year in initially soft-pedaling the losses, Bharara added "" this was not a tempest in a teapot, but rather a perfect storm of individual misconduct and inadequate internal controls.""

EXCERPTS:Behind the scenes of Morgan's bad bets

The Securities and Exchange Commission simultaneously filed a parallel civil complaint in which the agency signaled it would hold the bank accountable for disclosing inaccurate information to investors about the trading.

""JPMorgan failed to furnish to the commission ... such financial reports as the commission has prescribed,"" the civil complaint charged.

The bank's shares were down 40 cents, to $53.75, in pre-market trading Thursday.

The court filings depicted the suspects as knowingly manipulating bank records while trading losses piled up — and as pressure mounted from senior officers aware of the growing problem. ""They definitely knew they were cooking the books,"" said Bharara.

The allegations focus on derivatives trading in JPMorgan's Chief Investment Office based in the global bank's London and New York locations. The office had more than 100 traders who managed excess deposits that totaled approximately $350 billion in 2012, the court complaints charged.

The London traders worked on a portfolio that totaled approximately $157 billion in net positions.

According to court document affidavits by FBI agent Jonathan Polonitza, Martin-Artajo and Grout manipulated the portfolio that tracked trading ""in order to achieve specific daily and month-end profit and loss objectives.""

Essentially, the co-conspirators ""artificially increased the market value of securities in order to hide the true extent of hundreds of millions of dollars in that trading portfolio,"" the affidavit alleged.

The alleged scheme resulted in a fast-growing disparity between the value of trading positions listed in the bank's financial records and the amount those positions were actually worth. The manipulation ""artificially increased the marked value of securities in order to hide the true extent of hundreds of millions of dollars in losses in that trading portfolio,"" the court complaint charged.

The conspiracy operated from at least March 2012 through May of that year, the court complaints charged.

JPMorgan Chase's April 13, 2012, quarterly earnings release and the quarterly statement the bank filed with the SEC the next month were ""based in part on false and fraudulent information"" provided by Martin-Artajo, Grout and an unidentified co-conspirator, the court complaints charged.

The bank ultimately announced in July 2012 that it would restate its first-quarter results by $660 million to reflect the estimated losses at that time.

Attorneys for Martin-Artajo at the Norton Rose Fulbright law office in London declined to comment on the charges. But in a statement issued Tuesday, the attorneys said he was confident ""that when a complete and fair reconstruction of these complex events is completed, he will be cleared of any wrongdoing.""

Manhattan defense attorney Edward Little said Grout was on a pre-scheduled vacation outside Great Britain but had no intention of fleeing to avoid prosecution. Little said that Grout had relocated to seek work in France after he lost his job at JPMorgan Chase.

Bharara declined to discuss potential efforts to extradite the suspects to the U.S., but said he hoped the traders would ""do the right thing.""

Authorities and the court filings confirmed that a cooperating witness who won't be charged in the case is Bruno Iksil, the former JPMorgan Chase trader who was dubbed the London whale for the size of his financial bets. That could make him a key government witness against former co-workers.

Iksil ""did sound the alarm more than once"" about record manipulation, said Bharara.

The criminal complaints state that senior bank officials were concerned about the internal valuations assigned to the trading positions and apparently pressured traders. In March 2012, Martin-Artajo allegedly directed Iksil and another bank employee ""not to show any additional losses"" in the portfolio if those losses were caused by a continued downward market trend.

Martin-Artajo allegedly explained ""that this was what 'New York' — that is the bank's senior management in New York — wanted, explaining that those JPM officials did not want to see day-to-day market volatility,"" the court complaint charged.

""I don't know where he (Martin-Artajo) wants to stop, but it's getting idiotic,"" Iksil told Grout during a March 16 online chat, referring to bank entry efforts that hid the size of the derivatives trading losses.

The court allegations trail behind a March U.S. Senate subcommittee report that concluded JPMorgan Chase had piled on risk, hidden losses, disregarded risk limits, dodged regulatory oversight and misinformed the public during the London-based trading episode.

The trading loss and investigation has been a black eye for JPMorgan Chase and Dimon.

Mark Kornblau, a JPMorgan Chase spokesman in London, said the bank declined to comment on the new charges.

""While the Feds are making a big splash by arresting the 'London Whale' minnows, there will be no justice until the whales in the executive office are charged,"" said Dennis Kelleher, head of Better Markets, a financial watchdog organization.

In a short sale the bank agrees to settle debt for the lesser amount and the seller gets nothing but is “ punished ” by not being able to finance another house for at least two years ( rules vary ) .

Data: FactSet; Chart: Axios Visuals

Thought bubble, via Axios' Felix Salmon: In most cases where there are big stock market moves, there’s no obvious big and surprising event that causes the move.

Market reports cite ""worries about global growth"" or ""concerns about the trade war"" or (in this case) something something coronavirus. Even though, as we’ve seen, the market is perfectly capable of ignoring coronavirus news.

Of note: The stock market, like most economic indicators, is generally only useful when you step back and look at the trend.

The big picture: Coming into 2020, fund managers expected the stock market to see increased volatility but to ultimately rise by around 5% from its end of 2019 level — the most cited target was for the S&P 500 to end the year at 3300, a mark it had surpassed by Feb. 5.

U.S. Treasury yields have fallen consistently, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note 50 basis points lower than at the start of the year, and yields on the 30-year bond falling to a record low Monday.

The yield curve has inverted. Again.

Stock traders have consistently ""bought the dip"" after down days in the market, a strategy that has been incredibly successful over the past decade and is likely to continue.

The value of the dollar and gold have risen to three- and seven-year highs, respectively, and seem to be the market's favored safe havens.

The city council said in a statement Tuesday that the city 's 2021 budget , totaling more than $ 88 billion , `` reduces police spending and shrinks NYPD 's footprint . '' The cuts came as the city is grappling with losing $ 9 billion in revenue amid the coronavirus pandemic .
The budget cuts nearly $ 484 million from the NYPD 's annual $ 6 billion budget and shifts funding to other agencies as well as youth and social services programming .
The changes will cancel a nearly 1,200-person police recruiting class set for next month ( though another class in October is scheduled to go forward ) , curtail overtime spending and shift school safety , crossing guards and homeless outreach away from the NYPD .
“ That work is not over , and while we have made progress , we are also vowing to keep fighting for fundamental changes to how we approach safety in schools , mental health and homelessness , '' said council Speaker Corey Johnson . `` Over the coming weeks , the council will be working on hearings and legislation to make sure that these changes are real . ''
Defund police ? Some cities have already started by investing in mental health instead
A statement from Mayor Bill de Blasio 's office said $ 430 million will be reinvested from the NYPD 's expense budget into youth and social services programming .
`` This budget prioritizes our communities most in need while keeping New Yorkers safe , '' de Blasio said . `` As we emerge from the epicenter of COVID-19 , it 's now more important than ever to create a fairer city for all . ''
The budget changes come as hundreds of protesters who have camped in front of City Hall for more than a week demanded that the police department be defunded . Organizers have called the movement “ Occupy City Hall , '' a reference to the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement that took place just a few blocks away .
Many people , including the New York Civil Liberties Union , have criticized the proposed budget . Public Advocate Jumaane Williams said in a statement that he plans to use his authority to prevent the budget from being executed , calling for a full NYPD hiring freeze and a commitment to transitioning from the current model for school safety .
“ In a moment when New Yorkers , with the entire nation , are demanding a reimagining of public safety , a reckoning with systemic injustices and inequities , the city falls far short with a budget that misses the moment of need , '' he said in a statement .
What does 'defund the police ' mean ? Here 's why some say 'reform ' is not enough
A representative for de Blasio told multiple media outlets that Williams ca n't stall the budget . U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , D-N.Y. , echoed the criticism Tuesday , saying the cuts do n't go far enough .
“ Defunding police means defunding police , '' the congresswoman said in a statement . `` It does not mean budget tricks or funny math . It does not mean moving school police officers from the NYPD budget to the Department of Education ’ s budget so the exact same police remain in schools . ''
The New York Times reported that the Department of Education already funds the school safety program , sending about $ 300 million a year to police , citing New York City ’ s Independent Budget Office . De Blasio said details were being worked out and the Education Department would train the agents .
Patrick Lynch , head of the Police Benevolent Association union , said the proposed cuts will lead to fewer officers on the streets amid a spike in shootings that has lasted several weeks .
“ We will say it again : the Mayor and the City Council have surrendered the city to lawlessness , '' Lynch said in a release . `` Things won ’ t improve until New Yorkers hold them responsible . ''
The council will proceed with hearings and legislation in July `` to ensure a just transition away from law enforcement in schools , homelessness and mental health , '' according to a statement .","As calls to defund the police grow louder around the country, New York City officials agreed on a budget that shifts roughly $1 billion from the police department, but advocates and lawmakers say the change doesn't go far enough.

The city council said in a statement Tuesday that the city's 2021 budget, totaling more than $88 billion, ""reduces police spending and shrinks NYPD's footprint."" The cuts came as the city is grappling with losing $9 billion in revenue amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The budget cuts nearly $484 million from the NYPD's annual $6 billion budget and shifts funding to other agencies as well as youth and social services programming.

The changes will cancel a nearly 1,200-person police recruiting class set for next month (though another class in October is scheduled to go forward), curtail overtime spending and shift school safety, crossing guards and homeless outreach away from the NYPD.

“That work is not over, and while we have made progress, we are also vowing to keep fighting for fundamental changes to how we approach safety in schools, mental health and homelessness,"" said council Speaker Corey Johnson. ""Over the coming weeks, the council will be working on hearings and legislation to make sure that these changes are real.""

Defund police? Some cities have already started by investing in mental health instead

A statement from Mayor Bill de Blasio's office said $430 million will be reinvested from the NYPD's expense budget into youth and social services programming.

""This budget prioritizes our communities most in need while keeping New Yorkers safe,"" de Blasio said. ""As we emerge from the epicenter of COVID-19, it's now more important than ever to create a fairer city for all.""

The budget changes come as hundreds of protesters who have camped in front of City Hall for more than a week demanded that the police department be defunded. Organizers have called the movement “Occupy City Hall,"" a reference to the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement that took place just a few blocks away.

Many people, including the New York Civil Liberties Union, have criticized the proposed budget. Public Advocate Jumaane Williams said in a statement that he plans to use his authority to prevent the budget from being executed, calling for a full NYPD hiring freeze and a commitment to transitioning from the current model for school safety.

“In a moment when New Yorkers, with the entire nation, are demanding a reimagining of public safety, a reckoning with systemic injustices and inequities, the city falls far short with a budget that misses the moment of need,"" he said in a statement.

What does 'defund the police' mean? Here's why some say 'reform' is not enough

A representative for de Blasio told multiple media outlets that Williams can't stall the budget. U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., echoed the criticism Tuesday, saying the cuts don't go far enough.

“Defunding police means defunding police,"" the congresswoman said in a statement. ""It does not mean budget tricks or funny math. It does not mean moving school police officers from the NYPD budget to the Department of Education’s budget so the exact same police remain in schools.""

The New York Times reported that the Department of Education already funds the school safety program, sending about $300 million a year to police, citing New York City’s Independent Budget Office. De Blasio said details were being worked out and the Education Department would train the agents.

Patrick Lynch, head of the Police Benevolent Association union, said the proposed cuts will lead to fewer officers on the streets amid a spike in shootings that has lasted several weeks.

“We will say it again: the Mayor and the City Council have surrendered the city to lawlessness,"" Lynch said in a release. ""Things won’t improve until New Yorkers hold them responsible.""

The council will proceed with hearings and legislation in July ""to ensure a just transition away from law enforcement in schools, homelessness and mental health,"" according to a statement.

Tsipras and his Greek gamble

Athens missed the deadline for a €1.5bn (£1.1bn, $1.7bn) payment to the IMF on Tuesday.

Only three other countries are still in arrears to the IMF - Sudan, Somalia and Zimbabwe. Between them, they owe €1.6bn, only marginally more than Greece.

The European Commission - one of the ""troika"" of creditors along with the IMF and the ECB - wants Athens to raise taxes and cut welfare spending to meet its debt obligations.

Last weekend, the Greek government took the unilateral decision to hold a vote, angering eurozone ministers.

EU leaders have warned that a ""No"" vote would see Greece leave the eurozone - though Mr Tsipras says he does not want this to happen.

Human rights body the Council of Europe has said the referendum would ""fall short of international standards"" if held as planned on Sunday.

The body's Secretary General Thorbjorn Jagland told AP that the fact the vote ""has been called on such a short notice... is a major problem"", and criticised the lack of clarity in the question to be put to voters.

A poll by the Greek newspaper Efimerida ton Syntakton published on Wednesday suggested that 54% of Greeks would vote against the creditors' terms for a bailout - but that the number of ""No"" voters had fallen since the introduction of capital controls.

Greece's cash trap - Dimitris Katsikas, Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy

The economy is frozen and we're in a liquidity trap, where everyone wants to hold euros.

Investment is non-existent and consumption has collapsed.

People have stopped submitting tax income statements and with the banks closed the government cannot receive anything. Supermarkets don't know what to do with the cash they receive.

We are not in the eurozone bailout programme so the European Central Bank cannot increase funding to the banking system.

Credit agencies have reduced the ratings on Greek banks so they're almost junk and even if they have collateral to give they may not be able to get new funding. Plus, we are essentially in default of the IMF.

Even if there is a deal, capital controls will be here for some time because there would be a rush on the banks if they re-opened.

An interim solution would only calm the symptoms of the crisis. Under a more permanent deal difficulties would remain for some weeks.

What happens next?

5 July - Referendum on creditors' proposals takes place, which many say is effectively a vote on Greek membership of the eurozone

20 July - Greece must redeem €3.46bn of bonds held by the European Central Bank. If it fails to do so, the ECB can cut off Greece's access to emergency loans

You already know what to do from a germ perspective: wash your hands, stay home if you can and wear a mask if you can’t. Now it’s time to tackle etiquette — basic rules for behavior to make quarantine life more bearable for everyone.

The Post talked to therapists, professional shoppers and smart people with good opinions to put together this guide to courteous living during COVID-19.

Grocery shopping

“There’s a lot of social rules that are really in flux right now, and one of them is grocery shopping with others in tow,” Staten Island Instacart shopper Tim Hickey tells The Post. If your grocery store hasn’t mandated that only one person from your party enter the store, follow suit anyway. It makes it easier for essential workers to keep a distance at work.

Make sure to wear a mask, even though it’s annoying, he adds.

Getting food delivered

If you’re getting your groceries delivered, think about the items you’ve selected. Heavy items, like cases of water bottles or large bags of rice from Costco, are hard to carry. It also makes professional shoppers less likely to select your order, says Hickey.

Delivery people don’t want to touch you as much as you don’t want to touch them. Most drivers are operating under no-contact delivery orders. Don’t expect your groceries to be brought into your home. If you’d like them left in a certain area, note that in the app or contact your driver.

The same thing goes for ordering takeout.

“I don’t want to hand food to you. It’s best if you stay inside your house when I’m delivering anything,” says Hickey.

When it comes to tipping, doing so within the app is best right now, says Hickey, who also drives for DoorDash and Uber Eats.

“I really don’t want to have to take anything from the house,” he says.

Most of his customers have been tipping him more than 20 percent, he adds.

Stepping out

In normal times, personal space isn’t really a concept for busy New Yorkers, who pack themselves like sardines into subway cars. But right now, it’s imperative to be mindful about how much room you’re taking up on the sidewalk.

It’s OK to go on walks with members from your household, but step aside when around strangers. Make sure you’re staying 6 feet apart, and if there’s someone nearby, rearrange yourself into a single file to make passing safer. That goes for your partner, roommate or even kids. “I move the farthest right as I can. If there’s no room, I cross the street, “says Christan Marashio, a dog walker on the Upper East Side. “I cannot count on other people to do it. You can only really count on policing your own behavior.”

Dealing with your co-workers

Working from home shouldn’t change your behavior all that much, says Maggie Craddock, founder of Workplace Relationships.

“If we were still in an office setting, how would you gauge it?” she recommends employees ask themselves. That means that if you normally wouldn’t alert your team if you’re stepping out for 20 minutes, there is no need to now, either.

Videoconference calls through Zoom or Google Hangouts have become the norm, but they should be used wisely, says Craddock.

“Everybody’s moods are so fluid right now,” she says. So ask your team if they’d prefer to do a call over video or by phone. “One day, people might be dying to see each other’s expressions”; other days, not so much.

And whenever possible, be extra kind — to your teammates, who are also under additional strain right now, and to yourself. If you’re feeling burnt out or dealing with a personal problem, be honest about it, and ask for assistance.

“If you’re honest and direct about it, people are usually willing to help,” she says.

Inside your house

It’s OK to let certain battles go to maintain harmony at home. But there’s one you can’t back down on: If you’re living with someone you feel isn’t taking social distancing seriously, be blunt, says Matt Lundquist, a psychotherapist and the founder of Tribeca Therapy.

“People need to say, ‘Sorry, I know you think I’m being unreasonable, but I need to really insist on this,’ ” he says. If they push back (don’t be the person who pushes back!), say something like, “You don’t need to agree on all the nuances of what is and isn’t risky, but you do need to respect me.”

If they can’t get on board, you may need to find somewhere else to stay, or to ask them to leave. That’s how important it is.

For other issues, compromise is key. Adults moving back into their parents’ house should be extra careful to keep the peace right now — which can mean reigning it in when you want to sound off. This is not the time to have fights that make you re-evaluate your relationship with your mother. “People are needing to make concessions to survive,” says Lundquist.

Those concessions can come into play with couples, too. “One partner [may] drink too much,” says Lundquist. “I think this is not the moment to be getting in a fight around that. Maybe you’re learning things about the long-term viability of this relationship, [which should be dealt with] when we’re in a post-pandemic world.”

Talking with friends

Pre-pandemic, FaceTiming a friend without asking them first was “really abrasive,” says Gina Tomaine, health and wellness editor at Philadelphia magazine. But now, random video calls are becoming the norm because most of us are at home all day.

“That stigma of someone FaceTiming you at a time that’s not opportune isn’t there anymore,” says Tomaine. “It brings back that casual intimacy that we used to have in our lives.”

If this is happening to you and you’re not into it, be direct with your loved ones. You can say, “I’m really down today and I’m not up for it,” or “I’m exhausted and I had a busy work day,” says Tomaine. “I think everyone really understands right now.”

Elisavet Zachariadou is a retired professor of history in Athens. She admires Italian art and reads French literature and German philosophy. She considers herself a European.

""When I learned that Greece is going to be part of the European Union [in the 1980s], I was very happy,"" she recalls. ""And I said, 'How nice. And how good for all of us.' ""

But Zachariadou's attachment to Europe is complex. She's 84 and lives in the Athens suburb where she grew up during World War II, when Nazi Germany invaded Greece and her people suffered horribly.

""It was not strange to open this door and find a person dead in the street because of starvation,"" she says.

European meddling is part of modern Greek history. Zachariadou brings up Klemens von Metternich, a German prince who served as foreign minister in the Austrian Empire. Metternich opposed the creation of the modern Greek state that emerged after war with the Ottoman Empire in the 1820s.

""I am surprised to see in Germany a tendency in the spirit of Metternich today, that we are just troublemakers,"" she says.

In short, Zachariadou doesn't trust German or other European leaders, and that's why she's voting ""no"" in Sunday's referendum. She says the Europeans leaders don't have Greeks' best interests at heart.

A Narrow Question — Or A Broad One?

Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras says the referendum is limited to the narrow question of whether Greece should accept the deal that's been offered by the country's creditors.

But others say it has broader implications and will, in effect, indicate whether Greece wants to stay in the eurozone and maintain close ties with the rest of the continent.

At an upscale cafe in another suburb, Giorgos Papadopoulos, who runs his family's kitchen furniture business, says Greeks owe Europeans a lot.

""We have access to one of the largest markets on the planet,"" he says. ""We can travel wherever we want. We have one currency.""

Papadopoulos, 37, grew up in a democratic Greece that followed a six-year military dictatorship.

He knows from history books that foreign influence has often been bad for Greece. But he says he's tired of hearing conspiracy theories that foreign powers are intent on destroying the Greek economy.

""People say they want to bankrupt Greece so they can buy cheaper,"" he notes. ""They are going to buy cheaper what? The sun? The beaches? These are not things they're going to take away from us. They will always be here.""

Similar Debate In The 1980s

Greece was also divided when it debated whether to join the European Union, which it did in 1981. At the time, socialists said Greece belonged to the Greeks and should not join. Conservatives said Greece was part of the West and should integrate with Europe.

Papadopoulos takes the latter view and says Greece would be exposed and isolated if it leaves the eurozone.

""This is the biggest union of countries in the history of this planet, but everyone joined in willingly and still countries want to join in,"" he says. ""You don't feel narrowed down to your own country's borders. I feel a lot stronger when I'm in the EU as an individual and as a country.""

He's going to vote ""yes"" on the referendum. He says it's a vote for Europe and its common currency.

Zachariadou says she doesn't need the euro to feel European.

""What they try to tell us is that Europe is something superficial,"" she says. ""Europe is a coin. And this, I don't want to accept this.""

For her, Europe should be united by more than just money.",www.npr.org,center,b531AUX95LNNpals

Some 10,056 of the 22,935 U.S. fatalities were in New York State, as of Monday; almost 7,000 of those deaths were in New York City. Nearly 189,000 of the 568,176 confirmed cases in the U.S. were in New York State.

Dispatches from a pandemic:Letter from New York: ‘When I hear an ambulance, I wonder if there’s a coronavirus patient inside. Are there more 911 calls, or do I notice every distant siren? I love my adopted city, and I’m not going anywhere. I will ride this out’

Black and Latino New Yorkers are twice as likely to die as Asian or Caucasian people in New York City. There are currently 1,897,373 confirmed cases worldwide, and 118,304 deaths, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said.

The savings of millions of people, meanwhile, are at risk of running out. A quarter of U.S. adults say the coronavirus pandemic is a major threat to both their health and their finances, found the survey released this week by Pew, a Washington, D.C., think tank.

The poll of 11,537 U.S. adults, conducted between March 19 and 24, found that significantly more people in their 30s through 50s say COVID-19 is a major threat to their finances but not to their health than those reporting the opposite.",www.marketwatch.com,right,nl3ixNaMbQCfDygS

Earlier this month, California passed a bill allowing 10 city governments in the state to establish a public bank. It's only the second state in the U.S. to take the leap — North Dakota has had a public bank for a century — but other states are dabbling in the idea.

In the aftermath of the 2008 financial collapse, when the privately-owned banks of Wall Street are as bloated and vulnerable to crisis as ever, public banking seems like an idea whose time has come: It's being proposed for everything from ending the financial exploitation of low-income Americans to providing the financial engine of a Green New Deal.

A private bank gets its startup capital from private investors. They run the bank's governance, and they receive the bank's profits. By contrast, a public bank gets its startup capital from the tax revenue of whatever state or local government creates it. The public bank is answerable to that government, and whatever profits the bank makes are returned to that government. Currently, state and local governments sock away most of their tax revenue — just over $500 billion of it — away in private banks. So the general idea for starting up a public banking system then is for those governments to transfer those funds to the public banks they create to get them off the ground.

This financing, in turn, creates a major difference in the incentives that drive how a public bank operates.

Under capitalism, the basic purpose of using loans to finance economic activity is that it's a way to judge the worth of different economic projects. Every investment is an experiment and a risk.

The Dow, the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite all posted their largest two-day percentage gains since Aug. 27, 2015.

However, on a month-to-date basis the averages remain down: The Dow is 9.74 percent lower and year-to-date it is down 6.75 percent.

Most of Thursday's session saw stocks in negative territory with the decline in equities broad based -- all 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 were down for much of the day as were all 30 components of the Dow.

Before the late-session turnaround, the S&P 500 was headed for its worst month since February 2009. The Nasdaq was on pace for its worst month since November 2008, and also on pace for its eighth 2-percent-or-more down day in December.

The downdraft stemmed from several causes: Worries about the health of the global economy, concern about possible future interest rate hikes, anxiety over the effects of the U.S.-China trade war; and turmoil in the Trump administration.

Thursday's volatility followed a massive gain on Wednesday when the Dow rose more than 1,080 points, or nearly 5 percent, marking the first time in history the exchange rose more than 1,000 points in a single day of trading. The S&P 500 climbed more than 100 points, or about 5 percent, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose more than 360 points, or nearly 6 percent.

Volume was slightly below the month-to-date average.

China’s Shanghai Composite index fell 0.6 percent.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell 0.6 percent.

In economic news, the U.S. Labor Department continues to publish data during the partial government shutdown. The weekly number of people filing for first time jobless claims fell by 1,000 in the past week to 216,000. That came in slighly under the Wall Street estimate for 217,000.

The prior week's claims rose by 3,000 to 217,000.

Gains Wednesday in the tech and retail sectors drove the rally, helping the market recoup losses witnessed on Monday. The energy sector also rose, with U.S. crude oil prices soaring more than nine percent after weeks of declines.

Stocks had taken a beating recently on lingering worries about the economy and caution over persisting political uncertainties, as a partial federal government shutdown lingers and President Trump's continues his hostile stance toward the Federal Reserve.

That's what happened in 1987 after Black Monday, 1998 after the Russian debt crisis and 2011 following the American credit rating downgrade. In 1987, the market soared 50% in the following two years. Stocks bounced back 20% within four months of their lows in 1998 and 2011.

Stocks could roar back to new highs next year as they did this summer. Or this could be a recession warning sign and a signal of worse news to come.

Stocks do a reversal, global stocks caught in the tumult

On Thursday, some of the market's big winners the prior day lost ground.

Tech, which led yesterday's rally, finished the day mixed. Amazon ( AMZN ) and Apple ( AAPL ) fell slightly, while Facebook ( FB ), Alphabet ( GOOGL ), and Netflix ( NFLX ) ticked up.

All nine sectors on the Dow finished in positive territory. 3M ( MMM ) and IBM ( IBM ) were the top performers on the Dow.

GE ( GE ) had its fifth-best day of the year Wednesday, but dropped 1.6% Thursday.

European markets fell sharply on their first day of trading since Monday. The FTSE was down 1.5% and Germany's DAX fell 2.4%.

Fears of China contagion

China is the world's second-biggest economy. Its explosive growth in the last two decades has been the engine for the global economy. Its enormous appetite for raw materials like oil, copper and iron ore fueled global growth, especially in emerging markets like Brazil that are rich in natural resources.

But that story has been completely derailed by China's economic slowdown. Just how much China slows down matters greatly to investors around the world.

All U.S. stock market indexes are in correction

Fears about the health of China's economy have ratcheted up to the point that the S&P 500, made up of the largest U.S. companies, is now sitting in ""correction"" territory -- a 10% decline from a recent peak.

Both the Dow and Nasdaq fell into correction mode on Friday, the first since 2011.

banking_and_finance,Politico,0,http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/elizabeth-warren-wall-street-215452,Has Elizabeth Warren defeated Wall Street?,2015-11-03,"Ben White, Lauren French, Daniel Strauss, Anna Palmer","NEW YORK — Hillary Clinton recently went on Stephen Colbert ’ s “ Late Show ” and said she ’ s now prepared to bust up the big banks . If banks make too many risky investments , “ they have to know — their shareholders have to know — they will fail . ”
But Clinton might not have to deliver that message . Neither will Bernie Sanders , who wants to go even further in reining in the banks . Nor will Republicans who are joining in the chorus .
Because under all this heavy pressure from progressives behind Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D-Mass . ) on the left and populists like Donald Trump on the right — and the weight of new regulation and activist shareholders — Big Wall Street is already shrinking on its own .
JPMorgan Chase is selling off a chunk of its private equity business . AIG is contemplating breaking into smaller pieces . Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are watching trading profits dwindle with no real clue whether or when they will ever come back . Giant banks including Wells Fargo will now be required to raise about $ 120 billion in new capital . General Electric is getting out of the financial services business entirely .
The battle cry to break up the biggest banks and reinstate the Depression-era rule separating investment and commercial banking will certainly go on . But in concrete ways , the pitchfork-wielding forces looking to storm Wall Street ’ s gates continue to win big , even though headlines might make you think otherwise .
“ I ’ ll believe that Wall Street has really gotten the message when we go a full 12 months without a major scandal of somebody breaking the law , ” declared Warren , the political leader of the financial reform movement , in an interview with ███ . “ But right now I think we ’ re doing the right thing . ”
Financial reformers say that the shifts on Wall Street reflect both required regulatory changes and a realization on the part of big banks that the political tide is moving swiftly against them .
Clinton continues to move leftward on Wall Street reform , pressed by Sanders and the specter of Warren , who has declined to endorse anyone in the Democratic primary and said she wants to hear even more tough talk and policies from Clinton .
On the right , Wall Street ’ s darling candidate , former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush , is languishing in the polls , largely rejected by a conservative base that distrusts the financial elite and the power of the big banks .
While the industry retains powerful lobbying influence in Washington , its clout is on the wane , a fact that reflects strong bipartisan support for even greater crackdowns on the financial industry . Community bankers now arguably hold bigger lobbying clout in D.C. than Wall Street does .
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll found that 67 percent of Americans would support a president who backs tougher regulations on big banks . The support crosses all ideological and partisan lines .
“ If you look at all the polls and focus groups on it , it ’ s pretty clear the American people still perceive correctly the threat that Wall Street poses and the need for it to be regulated and for the government to regulate it , ” said Dennis Kelleher , CEO of financial reform group Better Markets . “ Both parties have to address this issue as best they can because the American people are very clear on it . ”
Executives at big banks say privately that the trend in the industry is very much to slim down to avoid additional regulatory costs and pressure from shareholder activists and populist politicians who argue that their size no longer makes any sense .
“ Dodd-Frank , no matter what Bernie Sanders or anyone else says , has put a tax on the size of banks ; you pay more if you are bigger , and there is real change because of it , ” said a senior executive at a large Wall Street bank who declined to be identified by name because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue . “ Everyone wants to be more banklike and less tradinglike . People want to get more boring and smaller . No one is looking to bulk up . ”
The latest evidence of the changing face of Wall Street piled up in the past few weeks .
JPMorgan Chase , the largest bank in the world by assets , is moving to sell the bulk of Highbridge Capital , the $ 22 billion private equity business it bought before the financial crisis . A large part of the reason for the sale : Highbridge no longer wants to be tied down by the regulatory constraints now placed on the biggest banks .
Profits at Morgan Stanley fell 42 percent in the third quarter , driven down by lower trading revenue . Goldman Sachs ’ profit fell by nearly 40 percent . JPMorgan , Bank of America and Citigroup also saw drops in trading performance .
Big banks still dominate the derivatives trading market — a major current target of financial reformers — but changes contained in the Volcker rule ban on big banks making large bets with their own capital are slicing into an area that historically has been one of Wall Street ’ s biggest profit drivers . And there is a good chance those profits are gone for good .
The changes are not limited to high-flying investment banks . The Federal Reserve on Friday moved to require Wells Fargo and other big banks to add more long-term debt in ways that could cut into bank profits , further making size less attractive . Many large banks , including JPMorgan , are now moving to discourage big deposits from corporations and hedge funds because it costs them too much to hold the money based on new regulatory requirements .
All this has financial reformers pleased , if not declaring victory .
“ I ’ m encouraged and think we ’ ve made some real progress , ” said Simon Johnson , a professor at MIT and a leader in efforts to make big banks less risky and more transparent . “ Dodd-Frank has clearly had some impacts , and the biggest part of it is a change in regulatory attitude . Before the crisis , the Fed thought bigger was more efficient . Now the Fed and others are much more concerned about banks becoming larger . ”
By sheer size of assets , many of the largest banks are bigger than they were before the financial crisis , in part because of the consolidation that took place as weaker institutions like Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns failed and were absorbed by stronger players like JPMorgan . Citigroup , however , is notably smaller than it was before the crash .
And by other measures , the biggest banks now hold more capital and take less risk than they did before the crisis , though in some cases the changes are relatively small . Still , the trend reflects both that regulation has made size and risk more expensive and that banking executives realize they have to make changes and improve their standing with the public before even more change is forced upon them . A recent Government Accountability Office study found that the “ subsidy ” big banks enjoy from investor perceptions that they would receive a bailout is shrinking .
“ Since Dodd-Frank , the share of assets created by small and medium-size banks is faster than the growth rates for big banks , that ’ s really the biggest thing , ” said Tony Fratto of Hamilton Place Strategies , which does consulting work for large financial firms . “ And a lot of capital requirements are not present-day requirements , they are future requirements , and the banks have already met them because that ’ s what the market demands . And the market has also demanded that big banks get rid of certain business lines . ”
In one of the more remarkable developments in recent weeks , billionaire hedge fund manager Carl Icahn has taken aim at insurance giant AIG , whose giant derivatives bets required an $ 85 billion bailout during the financial crisis .
Icahn argues that regulation — notably the costs associated with being labeled a Systemically Significant Financial Institution — is weighing on AIG ’ s results and that the company would be much more valuable broken up in to smaller pieces . AIG is reportedly considering selling off some of its parts .
Goldman Sachs analysts recently issued a report making the same case for a break-up of JPMorgan , though the company ’ s CEO , Jamie Dimon , has repeatedly rebuffed such arguments . Still , the regulatory and political costs of bigness have led banks to resist new deposits and , in the case of Bank of America , caused CEO Brian Moynihan to slash the size of its trading operation .
Even Goldman Sachs , which almost alone on Wall Street remains heavily committed to its trading business , has made strategic moves in the direction of fitting more neatly into the bank holding company status it acquired during the financial crisis . The bank recently bought an online deposit taker .
“ The pressure on these banks is only going to go up , and some have responded to it more than others , ” said Michael Mayo , a veteran banking analyst now at investment firm CLSA . “ JPMorgan ’ s downsizing this year is remarkable ; they have downsized an amount equal to the size of the 12th largest bank in America . The sum of the parts of many of these banks is worth significantly more than their current market value . And the threat from activist investors is now always there . ”

Because under all this heavy pressure from progressives behind Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on the left and populists like Donald Trump on the right — and the weight of new regulation and activist shareholders — Big Wall Street is already shrinking on its own.

The evidence is everywhere.

JPMorgan Chase is selling off a chunk of its private equity business. AIG is contemplating breaking into smaller pieces. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are watching trading profits dwindle with no real clue whether or when they will ever come back. Giant banks including Wells Fargo will now be required to raise about $120 billion in new capital. General Electric is getting out of the financial services business entirely.

The battle cry to break up the biggest banks and reinstate the Depression-era rule separating investment and commercial banking will certainly go on. But in concrete ways, the pitchfork-wielding forces looking to storm Wall Street’s gates continue to win big, even though headlines might make you think otherwise.

“I’ll believe that Wall Street has really gotten the message when we go a full 12 months without a major scandal of somebody breaking the law, ” declared Warren, the political leader of the financial reform movement, in an interview with POLITICO. “But right now I think we’re doing the right thing.”

Financial reformers say that the shifts on Wall Street reflect both required regulatory changes and a realization on the part of big banks that the political tide is moving swiftly against them.

Clinton continues to move leftward on Wall Street reform, pressed by Sanders and the specter of Warren, who has declined to endorse anyone in the Democratic primary and said she wants to hear even more tough talk and policies from Clinton.

On the right, Wall Street’s darling candidate, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, is languishing in the polls, largely rejected by a conservative base that distrusts the financial elite and the power of the big banks.

While the industry retains powerful lobbying influence in Washington, its clout is on the wane, a fact that reflects strong bipartisan support for even greater crackdowns on the financial industry. Community bankers now arguably hold bigger lobbying clout in D.C. than Wall Street does.

The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll found that 67 percent of Americans would support a president who backs tougher regulations on big banks. The support crosses all ideological and partisan lines.

“If you look at all the polls and focus groups on it, it’s pretty clear the American people still perceive correctly the threat that Wall Street poses and the need for it to be regulated and for the government to regulate it,” said Dennis Kelleher, CEO of financial reform group Better Markets. “Both parties have to address this issue as best they can because the American people are very clear on it.”

Executives at big banks say privately that the trend in the industry is very much to slim down to avoid additional regulatory costs and pressure from shareholder activists and populist politicians who argue that their size no longer makes any sense.

“Dodd-Frank, no matter what Bernie Sanders or anyone else says, has put a tax on the size of banks; you pay more if you are bigger, and there is real change because of it,” said a senior executive at a large Wall Street bank who declined to be identified by name because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue. “Everyone wants to be more banklike and less tradinglike. People want to get more boring and smaller. No one is looking to bulk up.”

The latest evidence of the changing face of Wall Street piled up in the past few weeks.

JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the world by assets, is moving to sell the bulk of Highbridge Capital, the $22 billion private equity business it bought before the financial crisis. A large part of the reason for the sale: Highbridge no longer wants to be tied down by the regulatory constraints now placed on the biggest banks.

Profits at Morgan Stanley fell 42 percent in the third quarter, driven down by lower trading revenue. Goldman Sachs’ profit fell by nearly 40 percent. JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup also saw drops in trading performance.

Big banks still dominate the derivatives trading market — a major current target of financial reformers — but changes contained in the Volcker rule ban on big banks making large bets with their own capital are slicing into an area that historically has been one of Wall Street’s biggest profit drivers. And there is a good chance those profits are gone for good.

The changes are not limited to high-flying investment banks. The Federal Reserve on Friday moved to require Wells Fargo and other big banks to add more long-term debt in ways that could cut into bank profits, further making size less attractive. Many large banks, including JPMorgan, are now moving to discourage big deposits from corporations and hedge funds because it costs them too much to hold the money based on new regulatory requirements.

All this has financial reformers pleased, if not declaring victory.

“I’m encouraged and think we’ve made some real progress,” said Simon Johnson, a professor at MIT and a leader in efforts to make big banks less risky and more transparent. “Dodd-Frank has clearly had some impacts, and the biggest part of it is a change in regulatory attitude. Before the crisis, the Fed thought bigger was more efficient. Now the Fed and others are much more concerned about banks becoming larger.”

By sheer size of assets, many of the largest banks are bigger than they were before the financial crisis, in part because of the consolidation that took place as weaker institutions like Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns failed and were absorbed by stronger players like JPMorgan. Citigroup, however, is notably smaller than it was before the crash.

And by other measures, the biggest banks now hold more capital and take less risk than they did before the crisis, though in some cases the changes are relatively small. Still, the trend reflects both that regulation has made size and risk more expensive and that banking executives realize they have to make changes and improve their standing with the public before even more change is forced upon them. A recent Government Accountability Office study found that the “subsidy” big banks enjoy from investor perceptions that they would receive a bailout is shrinking.

“Since Dodd-Frank, the share of assets created by small and medium-size banks is faster than the growth rates for big banks, that’s really the biggest thing,” said Tony Fratto of Hamilton Place Strategies, which does consulting work for large financial firms. “And a lot of capital requirements are not present-day requirements, they are future requirements, and the banks have already met them because that’s what the market demands. And the market has also demanded that big banks get rid of certain business lines.”

In one of the more remarkable developments in recent weeks, billionaire hedge fund manager Carl Icahn has taken aim at insurance giant AIG, whose giant derivatives bets required an $85 billion bailout during the financial crisis.

Icahn argues that regulation — notably the costs associated with being labeled a Systemically Significant Financial Institution — is weighing on AIG’s results and that the company would be much more valuable broken up in to smaller pieces. AIG is reportedly considering selling off some of its parts.

Goldman Sachs analysts recently issued a report making the same case for a break-up of JPMorgan, though the company’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, has repeatedly rebuffed such arguments. Still, the regulatory and political costs of bigness have led banks to resist new deposits and, in the case of Bank of America, caused CEO Brian Moynihan to slash the size of its trading operation.

Even Goldman Sachs, which almost alone on Wall Street remains heavily committed to its trading business, has made strategic moves in the direction of fitting more neatly into the bank holding company status it acquired during the financial crisis. The bank recently bought an online deposit taker.

“The pressure on these banks is only going to go up, and some have responded to it more than others,” said Michael Mayo, a veteran banking analyst now at investment firm CLSA. “JPMorgan’s downsizing this year is remarkable; they have downsized an amount equal to the size of the 12th largest bank in America. The sum of the parts of many of these banks is worth significantly more than their current market value. And the threat from activist investors is now always there.”

None of this means financial reformers will cease pressing their case or arguing for even more transparency and high capital levels for the largest banks. Johnson argues that the latest round of “living wills” for the nation’s largest banks — meant as road maps to wind down giant banks without a taxpayer bailout — was an abject failure. And he argues that leverage ratios — the key measure of big banks’ risk exposure — are not down very much from pre-crisis levels.

“I would say capital levels are higher than they were in the crisis, but it’s not really clear that there is significantly more loss-absorbing capital,” Johnson said. “But there is clearly some market pressure and concern about these companies being too big.”

Warren herself acknowledged that the big banks are “not taking on the same kinds of risks” that they did before the crisis, thanks to new regulations.

But she also made it clear that the pressure is only going to grow, meaning banks will remain on the defensive for the duration of the 2016 campaign and probably beyond. And moves to get smaller will likely continue.

The stock market has suffered a relentless, breathtaking drop — moving deeper into bear territory. Stocks fell so fast Thursday morning that it triggered a 15-minute halt in trading for the second time this week.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2,352 points, or nearly 10% — the biggest one-day drop since 1987. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were each down more than 9%.

Those indexes are now down at least 27% from record highs set just last month. The Dow is now down nearly 8,400 points from its peak on Feb. 12.

The market tumble came after President Trump announced a 30-day travel ban on visitors from European countries (not including the United Kingdom) to the United States.

Trump said it was an effort to stem the spread of the coronavirus, but the move caused confusion on both sides of the Atlantic and drew skepticism from several health experts. And it was also another blow to airlines, hotels and tourist attractions that have already taken a beating.

Chiavarone said the traditional playbook for investors was to look past jitters unless it appeared to impede global economic growth .

The ICE U.S. Dollar index DXY , -0.07 % , which measures the greenback ’ s strength against its six major rivals , was nearly flat at 96.90 .","U.S. stocks on Friday ended a holiday-shortened week solidly lower, with the Dow shedding more than 230 points, following escalating tensions in the Middle East and U.S. manufacturing activity that fell to its lowest reading in about a decade.

How did benchmarks perform?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.12% shed 233.92 points, or 0.8%, at 28,634.8. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.43% fell 23 points, or 0.7%, to 3,234.85. The Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.55% slipped 71.42 points, or 0.8%, to 9,020.77. All three benchmarks finished off their lows for the session, however.

The decline marked the worst for the Dow and the S&P 500 since Dec. 3 and the sharpest daily slump for the Nasdaq since Dec. 2, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

For the week, the S&P 500 lost 0.2%, while the Dow shed less than 0.1%. The Nasdaq Composite, meanwhile, managed a weekly gain of 0.2%.

What drove the market?

The Pentagon confirmed late Thursday that the U.S. military had killed Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard’s Quds Force, and said the strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attacks.

Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, declared three days of mourning for Soleimani’s death and said that a “hard revenge awaits criminals,” responsible for the attack. The Pentagon also said Friday afternoon it was dispatching more than 3,000 additional troops to the Middle East.

President Donald Trump said the U.S. remained “ready and prepared” to act if Americans are threatened following Soleimani’s killing, in televised remarks from his Mar-a-Largo resort in Florida. Earlier Friday he issued a number of tweets and said the top Iranian military commander “should have been taken out many years ago.”

....of PROTESTERS killed in Iran itself. While Iran will never be able to properly admit it, Soleimani was both hated and feared within the country. They are not nearly as saddened as the leaders will let the outside world believe. He should have been taken out many years ago! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2020

The prospect of sharp retaliation by Iran could keep market participants unnerved in the coming days and weeks.

“The initial reaction will lead to a risk-off for equity markets and upward pressure on oil prices,” Steven Chiavarone, portfolio manager at Federated Investors, told MarketWatch. “But what we don’t know is the timing and severity of Iran’s expected reaction.”

Indeed, the investor flight from risky assets toward traditional safer havens, including gold and U.S. Treasurys, stood in contrast to market action on Thursday, which saw all three major U.S. stock indexes post strong gains, ending the first trading session of 2020 at records. Markets were closed on Wednesday for New Year’s Day.

Still, stocks closed out the session with declines that were less severe than some market participants would ordinarily have expected, given the threat of a Middle East military confrontation.

Chiavarone said the traditional playbook for investors was to look past jitters unless it appeared to impede global economic growth. More important to the bull market’s momentum was the direction of growth, how much stimulus central banks provided, and if trade tensions continued to wane with the forging of the so-called “phase one” tariff deal between the U.S. and China, he said.

Minutes of the Federal Reserve’s last meeting, meanwhile, showed increased optimism in December among senior officials about the economy as Beijing-Washington trade tensions eased, but worries lingered about growth, including stubbornly low inflation.

Friday also saw worse-than-expected U.S. manufacturing data underlined risks to economic growth. The Institute for Supply Management’s closely watched December U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers index fell to 47.2%, its lowest since June 2009, from a reading of 48.1% in November, leaving the gauge in contraction. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch, on average, had expected the index to rise to 48.8%.

Separately, U.S. November construction activity rose by 0.6%, a sharp increase from the 0.1% rise registered in October.

“Investors are just trying to get their bearings for the year to come,” John Carey, director of U.S. equity income at Amundi Pioneer, told MarketWatch. “Now there is a wrench thrown into the works with this geopolitical uncertainty.”

Carey already had been feeling conflicted about U.S. stocks hitting all-time highs to end 2019. “I’ve been cautious for months,” he said. “Now I think you’ve got earnings to think about, and multiples are a little bit high.”

Investors also were hearing from a number of Federal Reserve officials, including Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan, who told CNBC on Friday that any reaction in oil prices to current geopolitical tensions likely will be more muted than a decade ago.

Chicago Fed President Charles Evans told CNBC on Friday that he remained upbeat on the economy and expected U.S. gross domestic product to expand between 2% to 2.25% in 2020, despite the contraction in manufacturing.

Which stocks were in focus?

The surge in oil prices sent airline stocks lower, dogged by the threat of higher fuel costs that could crimp their earnings. Shares of American Airlines Group Inc. AAL, +2.81% fell 5%, Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL, +1.55% dropped 1.7%, and United Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL, +1.56% shed 2.1%.

Shares of U.S. energy companies closed mixed, after giving up earlier gains. The SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF XLE, +1.21% closed 0.3% lower. Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, +1.14% fell 0.8%, Occidental Petroleum Corp. OXY, +3.31% jumped 2.4% and Marathon Oil Corp. MRO, +1.89% shares gained 0.5%.

Tesla Inc.’s stock TSLA, +0.46% gained 3% after the electric-vehicle maker reported delivery data that met its full-year guidance. For 2019, Tesla said it delivered 367,500 vehicles, within its guidance range of 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles.

Incyte Corp.’s stock INCY, +1.52% slumped 9.4% after the company said a key study of an experimental drug failed to hit its goal.

How did other markets trade?

Oil futures jumped, with U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude for February delivery US:CLG20 settling 3.1% higher at $63.05 a barrel, its best finish in more than seven months.

ProPublica has covered how budget cuts at the IRS have made it harder for the agency to ensure the billionaires of the world pay up, but the cuts haven’t affected everyone equally.

In short: Wealthy taxpayers haven’t faced as much scrutiny.

For people who claim the earned income tax credit, also referred to as EITC, earned income credit or EIC, the audit rate has gone down less steeply than it has for wealthier taxpayers. Now, a person claiming the credit has as much of a chance of being audited as someone making 20 times more money.

But that shouldn’t deter you from claiming it if you are eligible.

(Here’s why).

What is the earned income tax credit (EITC)?

The earned income tax credit is a tax credit meant to help working people with low or moderate incomes. Claiming the credit when you file your taxes may reduce how much you owe or, better yet, give you a refund.

You can receive as much as $6,557 in tax credit, depending on your status. It’s for this reason that the EITC is one of the most popular tax credits, even if it’s one of the least understood.

Who can get the EITC?

Individuals: If you’re filing taxes as a single filer without kids, you must have made less than $15,570 a year to claim the credit.

If you’re filing taxes as a single filer without kids, you must have made less than $15,570 a year to claim the credit. Parents: If you have a kid or have taken a young family member into your home, you should see if you qualify for the EITC. As a single person with three or more kids, filing as head of household, you can make as much as $50,162 a year and still claim the credit.

How do I figure out if I qualify for the EITC?

The best way to figure out if you qualify for the EITC is to use the IRS’ EITC Assistant, an easy-to-use guide that will ask you yes or no questions to determine if you’re eligible.

There are a few basic qualifications for the EITC:

You must have earned income from wages, a salary or a business.

You must be a citizen or legal resident.

You must have resided in the U.S. for more than half the year.

If you’re married, you must file your taxes jointly.

To claim a child, you must have a qualifying child.

Lastly, there are earned income limits. For the 2019 tax year, your adjusted gross income must be less than:

Earned Income Tax Credit Adjusted Income Caps For the category that you’re in, you must make less than this much before exemptions and deductions to claim the credit. Filing status Zero children One child Two children Three or more children Single filer or head of household $15,570 $41,094 $46,703 $50,162 Married, filing jointly $21,370 $46,884 $52,493 $55,952

Who is a qualifying child?

The full IRS guidelines on whether your child is a “qualifying child” are here, but let’s review the basics. Your child must:

Be your son or daughter (including adopted, step and foster children); brother or sister (including half and stepsiblings); or a descendant of them, such as a grandchild, niece or nephew.

Have been younger than 19 by the end of 2019, or younger than 24 if they’re a full-time student. If they do not meet these age requirements, they must have been permanently disabled before the end of 2019.

Live with you for more than half the year.

Have a valid Social Security number.

Will I be audited if I claim the EITC?

As ProPublica has reported, people who claim the EITC are audited at a higher rate than those who do not claim it. While you are more likely to be audited if you claim the EITC, the audit rate is still less than 2%. In 2018, 36% of audits, or around 380,000, were of filers who claimed the credit. Here are some tips for what to do if you’re audited.

One reason for this is that people often claim the credit in error. But also, budget cuts at the IRS mean there are fewer people to review audit documents. It’s much more expensive for the IRS to audit wealthy taxpayers, and it claims it can’t do so without more funding.

Last year, the top 1% of taxpayers by income were audited at nearly the same rate as EITC recipients, who typically have an annual income under $20,000.

When will I get my refund?

If you take the credit, by law, the IRS cannot issue your refund before mid-February 2020.

In 2015, Congress passed the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act, which permanently expanded the EITC, but delayed the payment of EITC refunds for taxpayers who file before mid-February.

The House is expected to vote on the package as soon as Friday . But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said there is no “ urgency. ” The Senate will wait until after Memorial Day to consider options .
“ We must think big , for the people , now , ” Pelosi said Tuesday from the speaker ’ s office at the Capitol .
Lines drawn , the latest pandemic response from Congress will test the House and Senate — and President Donald Trump — as Washington navigates the extraordinary crisis with the nation ’ s health and economic security at stake .
The Democrats ’ Heroes Act is built around nearly $ 1 trillion for states , cities and tribal governments to avert layoffs , focused chiefly on $ 375 billion for smaller suburban and rural municipalities largely left out of earlier bills .
The bill will offer a fresh round of $ 1,200 direct cash aid to individuals , increased to up to $ 6,000 per household , and launches a $ 175 billion housing assistance fund to help pay rents and mortgages . There is $ 75 billion more for virus testing .
It would continue , through January , the $ 600-per-week boost to unemployment benefits . It adds a 15 % increase for food stamps , new subsidies for laid-off workers to pay health insurance premiums under a COBRA law and a special “ Obamacare ” sign-up period . For businesses , it provides an employee retention tax credit .
There ’ s $ 200 billion in “ hazard pay ” for essential workers on the front lines of the crisis .
Pelosi drew on U.S. history — and poetry — to suggest “ no man is an island ” as she called on Americans to respond to the crisis with a strategy of science , virus testing and empathy .
“ There are those who said , ‘ Let ’ s just pause , ’ ” she said . “ Hunger doesn ’ t take a pause . Rent doesn ’ t take a pause . Bills don ’ t take a pause . ”
But the 1,800-page package is heading straight into a Senate roadblock .
Republicans are wary of another round of aid and McConnell declared the Democratic proposal a grab bag of “ pet priorities. ” He said Tuesday it is not something that “ deals with reality . ”
House Republicans also took a pass . “ I can ’ t believe that that would be real , ” said Rep. Andy Biggs , R-Ariz. , leader of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus , said in an interview .
This would be the fifth coronavirus package . It ’ s a starkly partisan offering with no real input from Republicans , who prefer to assess the impact of earlier expenditures before approving more .
But the political peril of doing nothing during an election year could prove challenging for Congress and the White House . As states experience flareups of virus outbreaks , and more than 30 million Americans remain unemployed in the shutdown , the near-term health and economic outlook remains daunting .
The Senate Democratic leader , Chuck Schumer of New York , warned that Trump and Republicans risk the same path as Herbert Hoover , the former president roundly criticized for failing to act to stem the Great Depression .
“ What is it going to take for Mitch McConnell to wake up and see the American people need help , and they need it now ? ” Schumer said .
The latest package extends some provisions from previous aid packages , and adds new ones .
There is $ 25 billion for the U.S . Postal Service . There is help for the 2020 Census , including the bureau ’ s request to delay deadlines for turning over apportionment and redistricting data . For the November election , the bill provides $ 3.6 billion to help local officials prepare for the challenges of voting during the pandemic .
The popular Payroll Protection Program , which has been boosted in past bills , would see another $ 10 billion to ensure under-served businesses and nonprofit organizations have access to grants through a disaster loan program .

WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unveiled a more than $3 trillion coronavirus aid package, a sweeping effort with $1 trillion for states and cities, “hazard pay” for essential workers and a new round of cash payments to individuals.

The House is expected to vote on the package as soon as Friday. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said there is no “urgency.” The Senate will wait until after Memorial Day to consider options.

“We must think big, for the people, now,” Pelosi said Tuesday from the speaker’s office at the Capitol.

“Not acting is the most expensive course,” she said.

Lines drawn, the latest pandemic response from Congress will test the House and Senate — and President Donald Trump — as Washington navigates the extraordinary crisis with the nation’s health and economic security at stake.

The Democrats’ Heroes Act is built around nearly $1 trillion for states, cities and tribal governments to avert layoffs, focused chiefly on $375 billion for smaller suburban and rural municipalities largely left out of earlier bills.

The bill will offer a fresh round of $1,200 direct cash aid to individuals, increased to up to $6,000 per household, and launches a $175 billion housing assistance fund to help pay rents and mortgages. There is $75 billion more for virus testing.

It would continue, through January, the $600-per-week boost to unemployment benefits. It adds a 15% increase for food stamps, new subsidies for laid-off workers to pay health insurance premiums under a COBRA law and a special “Obamacare” sign-up period. For businesses, it provides an employee retention tax credit.

There’s $200 billion in “hazard pay” for essential workers on the front lines of the crisis.

Pelosi drew on U.S. history — and poetry — to suggest “no man is an island” as she called on Americans to respond to the crisis with a strategy of science, virus testing and empathy.

“There are those who said, ‘Let’s just pause,’” she said. “Hunger doesn’t take a pause. Rent doesn’t take a pause. Bills don’t take a pause.”

But the 1,800-page package is heading straight into a Senate roadblock.

Republicans are wary of another round of aid and McConnell declared the Democratic proposal a grab bag of “pet priorities.” He said Tuesday it is not something that “deals with reality.”

House Republicans also took a pass. “I can’t believe that that would be real,” said Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., leader of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, said in an interview.

The Senate majority, the 53-member Senate Republican conference, is meeting for its regular luncheons most days, spread out three to a table for social distance. Democrats are convening by phone. Many senators, but not all, are wearing masks.

At least a dozen Capitol police officers and other staff have tested positive for the virus, and at least one senator, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, is in isolation at home after exposure from a staff member who tested positive. Other lawmakers have cycled in and out of quarantine.

For example, the previous peak in the Dow in 2007 was just before the onset of the Great Recession, and remember what happened then? Right, the economy crashed. People got scared. Hell broke loose. No -- not really, but there was plenty of fear going around.

Flash to present day. Some people are surprised that the stock market is doing so well, particularly in light of such high levels of unemployment. But maybe we should welcome the optimism since it can push along the economy.

The steady rise of the Dow since early 2009 has been driven mainly by two factors: the slow improvement in economic conditions and optimism since the recession ended, and the Federal Reserve's attempt to stimulate the economy using quantitative easing policies.

Under the policies, the Federal Reserve has purchased large volumes of financial assets, and the increase in demand for these assets from the Fed has lowered long-term interest rates and put upward pressure on the prices of stocks and bonds.

As asset prices increase, people feel wealthier and more secure because of increased value of retirement funds, education savings, and so on, and the increase in wealth and security makes it more likely that consumers will spend money on goods and services. This boosts GDP and employment, and the improved outlook for the economy can increase stock prices even further.

But when the 2007 recession hit and wiped out their retirement savings and equity in their home, they stopped traveling and instead began trying to rebuild what had been lost. They hunkered down, waiting for the storm to pass so to speak.

Gradually, they started to spend a bit more as stock prices and the economy improved, but they are not yet back to where they were before the recession.

My parents are more optimistic now, and that spurs them to spend more, which helps businesses and the economy. There are many Americans who went through similar experiences. If we add all of them together, we can see why things seem better than before. More people feel like we're on the right track. The high stock market prices reflect this sentiment.

Earlier Friday , CFPB head Richard Cordray announced that he was stepping down at the end of the day and elevated his chief of staff , Leandra English , to deputy director .
Cordray , the first and only director the agency has seen since it was created , is rumored to be eying a bid for Ohio governor . He announced earlier this month that he would be resigning before December .
The conflicting promotion from Cordray and appointment from Trump sets up a fight with little clear precedent , as there are now two acting CFPB heads . It ’ s the latest challenge to the CFPB 's standing as an independent agency .
The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act , the financial reform law which created the CFPB , established the deputy director position to lead the bureau between permanent directors .
Cordray cited the specific provision of Dodd-Frank that lays out the succession process in his announcement to CFPB employees . The deputy director position had previously been filled by David Silberman in an acting capacity .
“ In considering how to ensure an orderly succession for this independent agency , I determined that it would be best to avoid leaving this key position filled only in an acting capacity , ” Cordray said .
“ In consultation over the past few days , I have also come to recognize that appointing the current chief of staff to the deputy director position would minimize operational disruption and provide for a smooth transition given her operational expertise . ”

In a statement sent out just over an hour after Mulvaney 's appointment was announced , the White House said it would be holding a conference call with reporters on the designation on Saturday morning .

English , a senior CFPB employee , would likely continue the agency ’ s aggressive enforcement actions and sweeping lending rules . Mulvaney , a staunch conservative who once called the CFPB “ a sick , sad joke ” would likely freeze or significantly change the agency ’ s current agenda .
The White House said Trump “ looks forward to seeing Director Mulvaney take a common sense approach to leading the CFPB ’ s dedicated staff , an approach that will empower consumers to make their own financial decisions and facilitate investment in our communities . ”
The CFPB under Cordray issued transformative rules on mortgages and lending disclosures , student debt , predatory lending and used car loans while cracking down on fraud across the industry . The bureau won more than $ 12 billion in restitution for more than 30 million defrauded consumers , a figure often cited by its allies .

“ Call it relief spending , as it was heavily influenced by stimulus dollars , leading to sales increases in categories such as apparel , televisions , video games , sporting goods and toys , ” Walmart WMT , +0.06 % Chief Executive Doug McMillon said during the company ’ s earnings call Tuesday .
Target TGT , -1.13 % , BJ ’ s Wholesale Club Holdings Inc. BJ , -2.03 % and Best Buy Co.

At Walmart , Target , shoppers bought more TVs , electronics , gaming equipment and apparel . Walmart also saw increased demand for adult-sized bikes .
BJ ’ s CEO Lee Delaney told investors on Thursday that the company saw “ relatively significant growth ” in discretionary categories , including electronics and TVs .
“ We would imagine that there is certainly an impact from stimulus checks that are impacting the business , ” Delaney said . “ But I think it ’ s right to assume there is some benefit flowing through from stimulus checks in the business . ”
( BJ ’ s did not respond to a request for a further comment . )
At Best Buy , customers used their stimulus checks to buy computing and gaming equipment , Corie Barry , the company ’ s CEO , said on it Thursday earnings call .
“ Like many other retailers , we saw sales benefit during the last three weeks of the quarter as customers undoubtedly chose to spend some of their government stimulus money on the products and services we provide , ” Barry said .
( Best Buy did not respond to a request for a further comment . )
The different phases of the pandemic have shaped shoppers ’ choices . As stay-at-home orders were enacted across the country , “ parents became teachers , ” McMillon said on Walmart ’ s earnings call . “ Adult bicycles started selling out , as parents started to join the kids . An overlapping trend then started emerging related to DIY and home-related activities . ”
Consumers also bought sewing machines and bandanas to make their own face masks , he said .
Sales took off in mid-April when many Americans began to receive their $ 1,200 stimulus checks . Within 10 days of receiving their stimulus checks , households spent around one quarter to one third of it , research shows .

Before the checks were issued on April 15 , there was “ not as much demand ” for discretionary goods at Walmart , said spokesman Randy Hargrove , adding that sales increased “ towards the end of the quarter . ”
Target Corp. also experienced “ a rapid increase in traffic and sales ” for discretionary goods driven by the distribution of stimulus checks , CEO Brian Cornell said on the company ’ s Wednesday earnings call . “ We certainly saw an uptick as we reported starting on April 15 , as those checks arrived across America , ” Cornell said on the company ’ s call .
“ Before the checks were issued on April 15 , there was ‘ not as much demand ’ for discretionary goods at Walmart , said spokesman Randy Hargrove ”
Customers , he said , are “ still seeing the benefits of the stimulus check. ” People are shopping across all categories including apparel , which has been especially hard hit by the coronavirus-driven economic downturn .
( Costco COST , +0.99 % declined to comment on whether it has experienced the same trend in sales related to stimulus payments . )
iPhone maker Apple also saw sales increase after stimulus payments went out , Cook said on the company ’ s April 30 earnings call . “ A part of it is due to just our new products , ” Cook said . But another part of it is also “ due to the stimulus programs taking effect in April. ” ( Apple did not respond to ███ ’ s request for a further comment . )
Unlike Target and Walmart , which have remained open during the coronavirus outbreak and can sell apparel in-stores , “ non-esential ” clothing retailers including Gap GAP , +8.84 % , Nordstrom NRD , +2.77 % and Nike NKE , +3.49 % have been forced to close many stores across the country . As a result , retailers in the apparel industry have offered consumers online deals comparable to Cyber Monday .
Still , many Americans have used their stimulus checks to stock up on essentials . That ’ s especially true for those who received their checks in the first wave of stimulus payments , said Stuart Sopp , CEO and founder of Current , a New York City-based mobile-banking startup .
In mid-April when payments were initially distributed , “ most people immediately spent on groceries , ” said Sopp . Many Current members , he said , also took cash out of ATMs to “ pay friends back and pay their bills. ” He added , “ People were struggling for basic life essentials and the stimulus payments really helped them , which I think is what it was all about . ”
In the next wave of payments , which occurred towards the end of April , more people used the funds “ for everyday means , ” Sopp said . That included ordering more food delivery and takeout , and gas .
The $ 3 trillion coronavirus aid package the House of Representatives passed last week , dubbed the HEROS Act , calls for a second round of stimulus checks . President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell indicated that they are in no rush to sign the relief package to law . Trump has shown support for a second round of stimulus checks .
If people do end up receiving a second stimulus check , Sopp predicts most will use the money for the same purposes .
Best Buy ’ s Barry said Thursday that “ the impact of current to potential future government stimulus actions ” is something the company will keep an eye on “ for the remainder of the year . ”","While many Americans have used their stimulus checks to cover basic needs such as groceries, mortgage or rent, there’s evidence people are also spending the money on non-essentials including electronics, clothes and toys, according to major retailers.

Before the checks were issued on April 15, there was “not as much demand” for discretionary goods at Walmart, said spokesman Randy Hargrove, adding that sales increased “towards the end of the quarter.”

Target Corp. also experienced “a rapid increase in traffic and sales” for discretionary goods driven by the distribution of stimulus checks, CEO Brian Cornell said on the company’s Wednesday earnings call. “We certainly saw an uptick as we reported starting on April 15, as those checks arrived across America,” Cornell said on the company’s call.

“ Before the checks were issued on April 15, there was ‘not as much demand’ for discretionary goods at Walmart, said spokesman Randy Hargrove ”

Customers, he said, are “still seeing the benefits of the stimulus check.” People are shopping across all categories including apparel, which has been especially hard hit by the coronavirus-driven economic downturn.

(Costco COST, +0.99% declined to comment on whether it has experienced the same trend in sales related to stimulus payments.)

iPhone maker Apple also saw sales increase after stimulus payments went out, Cook said on the company’s April 30 earnings call. “A part of it is due to just our new products,” Cook said. But another part of it is also “due to the stimulus programs taking effect in April.” (Apple did not respond to MarketWatch’s request for a further comment.)

Unlike Target and Walmart, which have remained open during the coronavirus outbreak and can sell apparel in-stores, “non-esential” clothing retailers including Gap GAP, +8.84% , Nordstrom NRD, +2.77% and Nike NKE, +3.49% have been forced to close many stores across the country. As a result, retailers in the apparel industry have offered consumers online deals comparable to Cyber Monday.

Still, many Americans have used their stimulus checks to stock up on essentials. That’s especially true for those who received their checks in the first wave of stimulus payments, said Stuart Sopp, CEO and founder of Current, a New York City-based mobile-banking startup.

In mid-April when payments were initially distributed, “most people immediately spent on groceries,” said Sopp. Many Current members, he said, also took cash out of ATMs to “pay friends back and pay their bills.” He added, “People were struggling for basic life essentials and the stimulus payments really helped them, which I think is what it was all about.”

In the next wave of payments, which occurred towards the end of April, more people used the funds “for everyday means,” Sopp said. That included ordering more food delivery and takeout, and gas.

The $3 trillion coronavirus aid package the House of Representatives passed last week, dubbed the HEROS Act, calls for a second round of stimulus checks. President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell indicated that they are in no rush to sign the relief package to law. Trump has shown support for a second round of stimulus checks.

If people do end up receiving a second stimulus check, Sopp predicts most will use the money for the same purposes.

Best Buy’s Barry said Thursday that “the impact of current to potential future government stimulus actions” is something the company will keep an eye on “for the remainder of the year.”",www.marketwatch.com,right,aaTmu39ZfMCUHfBq

The comments by Gary Cohn , director of the White House National Economic Council , came in a private meeting with lawmakers on the Senate Banking Committee Wednesday , these people said . His remarks were reported earlier by Bloomberg .
Mr. Cohn was asked by Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D. , Mass . ) whether the administration planned to carry out a promise included in the Republican 2016 platform—and made by the Trump campaign—to restore the law separating traditional commercial banking from Wall Street investment banking . The law was repealed in 1999 .
Mr. Cohn expressed an openness to working with Ms. Warren on the issue , and said he could support a simple policy completely separating the two businesses , these people said . There are various ideas for restoring some form of Glass-Steagall , running the gamut from splitting apart firms completely to separating their various operations under an umbrella holding company .
A White House spokeswoman said Mr. Cohn “ was simply discussing the president ’ s previously stated position , ” adding , “ The president spoke to the need for a simplification of the banking system on the campaign trail , what he called a ‘ 21st century Glass-Steagall , ’ to make it easier for businesses to grow and create jobs in their communities . ”
Mr. Cohn ’ s comments are consistent with other statements by Trump administration officials . But it isn ’ t clear how much support there is for the idea among Republicans more broadly . Ms. Warren on Thursday reintroduced a bill called the 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act . Three other senators joined her , including one Republican , Sen. John McCain of Arizona . In the last Congress , Mr. McCain was the only Republican to sponsor the bill .
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has also said the administration is open to implementing some version of President Donald Trump ’ s campaign promise . But in his Jan. 17 confirmation hearing , he expressed concern that “ separating out banks and investment banks right now under Glass-Steagall would have very big implications to the liquidity in the capital markets and banks being able to perform necessary lending . ”
While the Trump team has endorsed the Glass-Steagall idea , it hasn ’ t come forward with its own proposal . Meanwhile , Treasury officials are meeting with financial-industry officials to discuss ways to roll back rules adopted under the Obama administration . They are due to make recommendations to the White House in early June .
Some observers said they didn ’ t view Mr. Cohn ’ s comments as a threat .
“ We continue to believe that a return of some form of Glass-Steagall remains more of a headline risk rather than a real policy risk and we think the odds are against the reinstatement of the law , ” Brian Gardner , an analyst with Keefe , Bruyette & Woods , said in a note to clients Thursday .
“ I don ’ t think we ’ re concerned , ” said one banker at a large firm . The bank is “ pleased with the direction ” of Mr. Trump ’ s administration and its executives aren ’ t racing to change strategy or make a big new lobbying push . “ It ’ s the same day as it was yesterday , ” this person said . “ It ’ s not a time to go crazy . ”
Tim Pawlenty , president of the Financial Services Roundtable trade group , said Thursday : “ Large financial institutions play a role in the American economy other institutions are not able to fill . We are working with Congress and the administration on a common-sense approach to financial regulation modernization and look forward to more progress . ”
Mr. Cohn ’ s comments will give Ms. Warren and other supporters of the idea more momentum . He was until recently the No . 2 executive at Goldman Sachs , the Wall Street investment bank that took on more traditional banking businesses—and the additional regulation that comes with them—after converting to a bank holding company to receive government assistance during the 2008 financial crisis .
Mr. Cohn “ was the most likely obstacle within the Trump White House ” to restoring Glass-Steagall , said Jaret Seiberg , an analyst with Cowen & Co. , in a note to clients . “ With him supporting Glass-Steagall ’ s restoration , there is no one in the inner circle left to fight it . ”
Mr. Seiberg said banks may be underestimating the threat : “ At some point the market is going to have to accept that the Trump administration is serious about restoring the Glass-Steagall separation between commercial and investment banking . ”
Glass-Steagall was adopted in the 1930s as a way to keep securities businesses separate from taxpayer-insured banks . The separation between lending and investment banking slowly eroded in the latter part of the 20th century , as banks won regulatory exceptions to diversify their businesses .
Since Congress repealed the law in 1999 , liberals have pushed for reinstating it , calling such a move a simple way to make the economy more stable by removing a taxpayer backstop from risky activities . Proponents of bringing back the law also say it would diminish the size and political influence of large Wall Street banks .
The 2010 Dodd-Frank regulatory-overhaul law took a half-step toward Glass-Steagall when it mandated the Volcker rule , which bars banks from certain activities unless they are trading on behalf of their customers . Many banks have since closed so-called proprietary trading desks .
The Glass-Steagall idea hasn ’ t gained broad support yet , even among Democrats . Former Federal Reserve Gov . Daniel Tarullo , the Fed regulatory guru who stepped down Wednesday , was asked about Glass-Steagall earlier this week . He pointed out that in 2008 , Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers—two investment banks without traditional lending businesses—caused significant financial stress .
“ Just by separating things doesn ’ t mean people stay out of trouble , ” he said , adding that there would be costs to forcing banks to separate and lose the potential business advantages of combining their operations . “ If you are going to have those costs and still have financial stability problems…then maybe we are not getting much after all . ”","WASHINGTON—The former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive who is the top White House economic adviser told lawmakers he could support legislation breaking up the largest U.S. banks, according to people familiar with the matter, a development that bolsters congressional efforts to reinstate the Depression-era Glass-Steagall law.

“Chairman Hensarling opposes reauthorization of Ex-Im because Washington shouldn’t pick winners and losers, and hardworking American taxpayers — who are already under tremendous stress — shouldn’t be forced to pay for foreign corporate welfare that advantages a handful of powerful, politically-connected corporations,” Hensarling spokesman David Popp said in a statement.

Boehner’s spokesman Michael Steel said in a statement, “Our Members, led by Chairman Hensarling, are continuing to discuss this issue.”",www.politico.com,left,m2ilEdElcAxo1zhV

Silicon Valley billionaires think they have a solution .
Election Day is less than six months away , and Democrats are scrambling to patch the digital deficits of their presumptive nominee . And behind the scenes , Silicon Valley ’ s billionaire Democrats are spending tens of millions of dollars on their own sweeping plans to catch up to President Donald Trump ’ s lead on digital campaigning — plans that are poised to make them some of the country ’ s most influential people when it comes to shaping the November results .
These billionaires ’ arsenals are funding everything from nerdy political science experiments to divisive partisan news sites to rivalrous attempts to overhaul the party ’ s beleaguered data file . They are pushing their favored , sometimes peculiar , fixes to a political ailment just like they might if on the board of a struggling startup .
This is all unfolding as the pandemic forces campaigns to pivot away from door-knocks and packed rallies and toward data mining and influencer marketing — which in many ways play to the strengths of these tech titans , making them even more influential at a time when many in the Democratic Party are uneasy with just how powerful some in tech have become .
Their investments matter all the more because of the candidate they inherited . Biden is rushing to hire more aides , create more engaging content , and build better ties with the Silicon Valley donors and talent that evaded him during the primary .
“ Because the Biden campaign is the Biden campaign , ” said one Democratic operative involved in these efforts , “ what we are doing on the independent side matters a hell of a lot more than it would previously . ”
“ Because the Biden campaign is the Biden campaign , what we are doing on the independent side matters a hell of a lot more than it would previously ”
What makes this all the more difficult is that Democrats have long struggled to coordinate their big-money spending like Republicans have , and that atomization has been exacerbated by the arrival of Silicon Valley money , whose hubristic entrepreneurs often prefer to do things their own way .
In Silicon Valley ’ s new political moment , four billionaires in particular — LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman , Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz , philanthropist Laurene Powell Jobs , and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt — have the most ambitious plans , according to Recode ’ s interviews with over 20 donors and operatives . The chess moves of this power set are instrumental to fulfilling Democrats ’ — and much of Silicon Valley ’ s — four-year quest to oust Donald Trump .
And yet each of these billionaires is moving their pieces with varying levels of secrecy , and often with minimal disclosure , scrutiny , or accountability .
Four years after the Democratic Party ’ s data was described by Hillary Clinton as “ bankrupt ” and “ on the verge of insolvency , ” tech billionaires are regrouping and pouring millions into the party ’ s digital infrastructure , even to the point of building competing power centers that threaten the Democratic establishment .
Republicans have invested far more steadily as of late than have Democrats in the data that powers modern campaigns . And so , a decade after a generation of tech wizards helped usher in a new era of digital campaigning that helped elevate Barack Obama to the presidency , it is Democrats who are left playing catch-up . Even if it was self-identifying progressives that created today ’ s digital tools , it was conservatives who mastered how to use them , and none more than Donald Trump .
“ My problem is when Silicon Valley folks think that they know how to do our jobs better . I would never walk into Google or anywhere else and say , ‘ Your model sucks . ’ ”
Now , some tech leaders , particularly Hoffman and Schmidt , are racing to master a sphere that , theoretically , is firmly in their bailiwick . But this determination has fueled competing , even rivalrous approaches from multiple tech billionaires . Some Democrats are concerned that both efforts , for all their urgency , are indeed too little , too late — at least for November .
The data wars are a stand-in for the broader tensions between the party and this quartet of Silicon Valley billionaires . While Democratic megadonors on Wall Street tend to route their donations to the party , tech billionaires like to claim they are offering more than just a check — and they want to be more in control .
“ My problem is when Silicon Valley folks think that they know how to do our jobs better . I would never walk into Google or anywhere else and say , ‘ Your model sucks , ’ ” Jane Kleeb , the chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party , told Recode . “ I don ’ t second-guess them , and I ’ m asking them not to second-guess us . ”
Kleeb and others in Democratic politics have been particularly incensed by a political startup that Hoffman has invested about $ 18 million , his single-biggest bet this cycle , in called Alloy . The startup is attempting to build a warehouse to store the data that various progressive groups collect on voters and use it to try to get them to the polls . As part of its data acquisition , Alloy has bought some lists of voters ’ cellphone numbers , a data source that people say Hoffman ’ s team , like other donors , sees as key this year due to the new need for digital campaigning .
But Alloy , despite all its promises to revitalize the left ’ s voter file , has had an at-times frosty relationship with party officials like Kleeb , who have their own voter file that they ’ d prefer to improve rather than circumvent . And some of the party ’ s most senior digital operatives consider Alloy to be an underachievement , saying that it has produced few tangible accomplishments , no publicly announced clients , and , most importantly , squandered significant time and money as it struggled to figure out its role in Democratic politics .
“ We ’ re already putting data into the hands of Democrats and progressives on the front lines of this critical election cycle , ” said Luis Miranda , an Alloy spokesperson . “ We ’ re proud of our work , and we ’ re just getting started . ”
And it ’ s not as though all tech billionaires on the same team are backing Alloy as the singular solution . Some are funding other rival revisions to the party ’ s data deficit . Where Hoffman sees a product to be replaced , Schmidt — a technocrat ’ s technocrat — sees a product that can be tweaked , perhaps with some executive coaching .
Sources say he has sunk money into the Democratic Data Exchange , a modest , competing effort by the Democratic National Committee to encourage data sharing by state parties to improve the party ’ s beleaguered digital backbone . Somehow , despite the somewhat duplicative efforts , Democrats still broadly fear that they ’ re at a disadvantage compared to the rival efforts of the GOP , which were created a decade ago .
Schmidt , a longtime Democratic powerbroker , may be working more closely with the party than Hoffman . But he is still critical of the party ’ s operatives and so is doing things his own way with his own skunk-works projects .
In 2016 , Schmidt effectively funded and embedded a group of technologists within the Clinton campaign . Many Silicon Valley hands , including some Biden allies , think the Schmidt effort was largely unsuccessful .
Four years later , Schmidt is as interested as ever in improving the party ’ s poor data and infrastructure — but now he has a new strategy : teaching its operatives how to use it .
Schmidt has quietly started a new division called OneOne Ventures to do this , in an already sprawling political empire stretching across a vast number of groups . OneOne has invested in more than 20 different political startups , according to a person familiar with its work , even though it has no public profile and its existence hasn ’ t been previously reported .
OneOne is essentially an attempt to serve as a bridge between traditional political operatives and technical teams . That ’ s why one of Schmidt ’ s key projects is heavily funding a never-publicized group called STAC Labs , created in late 2019 to train state parties on how to use data , according to a job posting , including what the Schmidt-backed Democratic Data Exchange gathers . STAC assigns team members to state parties that serve as consultants , of sorts , to help them model their voters and use data effectively .
Even Kleeb , who found Hoffman and Alloy “ arrogant , ” told Recode she finds her team ’ s weekly calls with STAC to be a “ real value add . ”
Just as is true in the data wars , the funding of ideological news sites is another battlefield where Democratic megadonors are mimicking Republicans . Democratic donors outside of tech tend to fund television ads . But the Silicon Valley set is uniquely seeking to build a digital world optimized for 2020 , drawing lessons from the right-wing media ecosystem that conservatives built and Trump capitalized upon in 2016 .
“ For far too long right-wing media has dominated our discourse and Facebook news feeds , ” said Tara McGowan , the founder of Acronym , a political group backed by Powell Jobs and Hoffman . “ We can ’ t sit by another cycle and watch a one-sided battle play out online . ”
Behind this , more than anyone else , has been Hoffman , whose team has funded projects that defenders say are a savvy way to take advantage of how information is distributed in the 21st century . Critics say they exacerbate political divides and sometimes push misinformation .
But that hasn ’ t deterred Hoffman : His aides have indicated that setting up partisan news sites that masquerade as journalism is one of the priorities of its group of allied donors .
In a private 12-page memo written by Hoffman ’ s top political adviser , Dmitri Mehlhorn , and distributed to prominent donors late last month , Mehlhorn said the key to “ beating Trump ’ s brand machine ” was in part to build an equivalent content machine on the left , “ building trusted media channels with peer-to-peer elements ” and “ content that has a journalistic flavor . ”
“ When truth is tribal , traditional media and advertising can ’ t reach voters ”
“ When truth is tribal , traditional media and advertising can ’ t reach voters , ” Mehlhorn says in his manifesto obtained by Recode . “ But people still listen to their friends and members of their communities . ”
That explains why , largely during the 2018 cycle , sources say Hoffman sank $ 15 million into MotivAI , a digital advertising firm that has promulgated what critics say was misinformation in the 2018 midterm elections . Hoffman has also indirectly invested in several other digital media companies through an incubator he backs called New Media Ventures .
And most of all , it explains why Hoffman put around $ 10 million into Acronym , one of the Democratic Party ’ s most controversial , and well-funded , outside groups that is also betting on partisan media .
Acronym aims to raise $ 25 million to set up seven of its own media properties in swing states , creating local news sites that portray moderate Democratic candidates in a favorable light , but appear to be objective , homespun outlets . Democratic operatives see what one calls an “ Upworthy model ” as an effective way to mobilize their base voters who are reluctant to turn out .
Steven Brill , a prominent journalist who now runs a center focused on combating misinformation called NewsGuard , deemed Acronym ’ s strategy both “ really smart and really terrible . ”
“ One of the things that really bothers me is the hypocrisy of people who say that they favor liberal values . And one of the most basic American values is the democratic process , ” Brill told Recode . “ When you undermine that process by posing as journalists — when you ’ re just out to make a partisan hit on someone or a partisan support of someone on the left — I think that is so hideous that it really needs to be called out . ”
Acronym says that its work is “ factual and transparently progressive . ”
This focus on “ information distribution ” has also led many Silicon Valley donors , directly or indirectly , to fund projects like Pulso and PushBlack , which are quasi-journalistic plays focused on the Hispanic and African American communities , respectively . They are seemingly not as partisan as Acronym efforts , but are , similarly , news publications with political objectives . For instance , PushBlack , which has also been independently backed by Hoffman , delivers a daily text message to its 4 million subscribers with calls to action on issues like criminal justice reform .
Two things both Pulso and PushBlack also do ? Register voters who are likely to be Democrats .
These tech billionaires , particularly Moskovitz and Powell Jobs , are also pouring millions into some of the country ’ s most ambitious voter-registration programs — almost all of it behind the scenes — hoping to emulate what worked for Democrats in 2018 .
The core voter-registration group that is raking in Silicon Valley money is called the Voter Participation Center . Along with a linked political group called the Center for Voter Information , it is in the process of trying to raise $ 56 million by June 30 thanks in part to a secretive group of donors called Mind the Gap , according to two donors who have been told about the fundraising goal in writing by Mind the Gap . That $ 56 million is in addition to the tens of millions that these groups raised from Mind the Gap donors earlier this cycle . VPC CEO Tom Lopach said these figures were “ grossly inflated ” but didn ’ t provide alternatives . ( Political nonprofits typically try to not let rivals know about their fundraising . )
Pulso and PushBlack are also indirectly being funded by Mind the Gap , which has already helped lead a recent $ 12 million fundraising drive to the media outlets ’ incubator , Accelerate Change .
With almost no public footprint , Mind the Gap , which is on track to route over $ 140 million this cycle , has established itself as one of the most powerful groups in Democratic politics .
“ Our mandate is simple : to identify all efforts that will be more cost-effective than giving directly to candidate campaigns or SuperPACs , and fund them up to the point of maximal impact , ” Mind the Gap wrote to its donors earlier this month .
That ’ s why Mind the Gap is heavily backing VPC . The group has been around for years , but VPC has recently become one of the hottest investment opportunities in Silicon Valley because its test-everything , measure-anything approach resonates with the tech set . It carried cachet before the coronavirus hit , and especially so now , given the new attention that every donor is placing on strategies like vote-by-mail , a new focus of VPC .
“ You had the organizations that were nice-to-haves that , all of a sudden , are integral , ” said one adviser to a major donor .
VPC , whose bread-and-butter program is registering voters through direct mail , has used testing , for instance , to learn that an official-looking plain white envelope with a registration application is more likely to be completed than one with an ideological appeal or eye-catching color . It sent 12 million of these no-frills mailers to unregistered voters last month . The group also learned that sending postcards to people on their 18th birthday encouraging them to register to vote is an effective , low-cost tactic .
And now they are using that expertise — and their ballooning scale — to try and conquer the vote-by-mail challenge .
That scalability , in the parlance of Silicon Valley , is key to its appeal in the industry : more tech money , more Democratic votes .
VPC ’ s backers include Powell Jobs , who sources say is in the process of paring back the volume of her political bets to double down on a smaller number of groups , particularly those like VPC that focus on voter turnout .
About a dozen of these groups , including VPC , PushBlack and Stacey Abrams ’ s FairFight , gathered at Powell Jobs ’ s Emerson Collective headquarters in mid-March to raise money for their 2020 plans , sources told Recode . Powell Jobs invited a dozen other deep-pocketed Silicon Valley donors for the intimate , theater-style pitch meeting , including Twitter co-founder Biz Stone and billionaire venture capitalist Ron Conway .
Some activists do have concerns that this relentless Silicon Valley push for efficiency can ignore the irreplaceable value of inherently inefficient work like person-to-person conversation , especially to turn out lower-propensity voters . Other operatives fret that while the experiments and mailers might eject Trump , it is a myopic approach , leaving next-generation , newly elected Democrats and long-term movement groups out to dry — just because they don ’ t meet the overly numerical tire-kicking from groups like Mind the Gap .
Still , this approach has its high-powered fans , perhaps none more than Moskovitz , a major Mind the Gap donor who is seeking to apply its strategy “ to an ever bigger extreme , ” said one person familiar with his thinking . Moskovitz ’ s North Star is a desire to nail the lowest “ cost-per-net-Democratic-vote. ” That ’ s largely led his team toward the funding of mail and voter-registration work , such as the millions that sources say he has put into the VPC this cycle .
Moskovitz , like VPC , is drawn to randomized , controlled experiments , so much so that he took the unusual step last year of hiring a newly minted MIT PhD to bring that rigor to his political work . He is single-focusedly driven by what this experimental design — which some other major donors find alienating — can teach him about partisan politics that can then be scaled . For example , Moskovitz ’ s team recently backed Voto Latino , a group focused on registering Hispanic voters , to fund a small experiment on whether certain pre- or post-roll videos encourage low-propensity Latino voters to search for voter-registration keywords on Google .
On calls with other prospective grantees , aides to Moskovitz , who observers feel largely got burned after coming from nowhere in 2016 to spend millions on late TV ads , have drilled operatives this time around on how they can empirically justify their effectiveness .
It amounts to a more premeditated , professional approach from Moskovitz compared to four years ago , when he has said he was “ slow to act , which I regret deeply . ”
For all these billionaires ’ best-laid plans to help-desk the Democratic Party ’ s digital woes before Election Day , Democrats fret that the coronavirus is dividing their attention and convincing some of them to reroute funds from political causes to charitable ones . Leaders of some Democratic groups , too , say privately they are concerned that the coronavirus could impact how much money their groups raise , either due to pinched net worths or endowments for the billionaire class , or because the rich feel a greater obligation to spend whatever money they do have on charitable work rather than on politics .
“ You ’ re prioritizing your time to think right now , and the money follows your time . How much time do you have to think about Joe Biden ? ”
One fundraiser close to the Biden campaign said he worried about the “ distraction ” faced by people like Schmidt and Hoffman , who have both dedicated significant energy to pandemic relief efforts .
“ You ’ re prioritizing your time to think right now , and the money follows your time , ” said one Biden fundraiser . “ How much time do you have to think about Joe Biden ? ”
Powell Jobs ’ s team has also suggested to some political groups that the coronavirus has made budgets tight and caused the Emerson Collective to rethink what precise efforts they will fund in 2020 , sources say . Schmidt ’ s political aides , by contrast , have indicated that they are prepared to spend more money on political causes than they initially planned to .
The coronavirus has also , of course , put pressure on the Biden campaign , too . Asking donors to pay $ 2,800 for a Zoom call isn ’ t always an easy sell , fundraisers say . One Silicon Valley billionaire described the nascent Biden-tech relationship so far as “ birds chirping. ” And so tech leaders have been flooding Biden officials with their digital suggestions for how to campaign during the coronavirus — even inviting his digital director to appear on the hot new app for Silicon Valley insiders , Clubhouse .
Other outreach comes more formally . On a call last Thursday organized by the Biden campaign , a group of major tech leaders was greeted by a special guest : Hoffman . The megadonor , who could spend as much as $ 100 million this cycle , told those on the line that politics would be his No . 1 priority through Election Day — he ’ d even step out of board meetings for it .
But he had an exhortation to Silicon Valley product minds , one brimming with irony .
“ We don ’ t need you to go and build anything new , ” a person on the call recalled Hoffman saying . “ There ’ s no time for that . ”

About a dozen of these groups, including VPC, PushBlack and Stacey Abrams’s FairFight, gathered at Powell Jobs’s Emerson Collective headquarters in mid-March to raise money for their 2020 plans, sources told Recode. Powell Jobs invited a dozen other deep-pocketed Silicon Valley donors for the intimate, theater-style pitch meeting, including Twitter co-founder Biz Stone and billionaire venture capitalist Ron Conway.

Some activists do have concerns that this relentless Silicon Valley push for efficiency can ignore the irreplaceable value of inherently inefficient work like person-to-person conversation, especially to turn out lower-propensity voters. Other operatives fret that while the experiments and mailers might eject Trump, it is a myopic approach, leaving next-generation, newly elected Democrats and long-term movement groups out to dry — just because they don’t meet the overly numerical tire-kicking from groups like Mind the Gap.

Still, this approach has its high-powered fans, perhaps none more than Moskovitz, a major Mind the Gap donor who is seeking to apply its strategy “to an ever bigger extreme,” said one person familiar with his thinking. Moskovitz’s North Star is a desire to nail the lowest “cost-per-net-Democratic-vote.” That’s largely led his team toward the funding of mail and voter-registration work, such as the millions that sources say he has put into the VPC this cycle.

Moskovitz, like VPC, is drawn to randomized, controlled experiments, so much so that he took the unusual step last year of hiring a newly minted MIT PhD to bring that rigor to his political work. He is single-focusedly driven by what this experimental design — which some other major donors find alienating — can teach him about partisan politics that can then be scaled. For example, Moskovitz’s team recently backed Voto Latino, a group focused on registering Hispanic voters, to fund a small experiment on whether certain pre- or post-roll videos encourage low-propensity Latino voters to search for voter-registration keywords on Google.

On calls with other prospective grantees, aides to Moskovitz, who observers feel largely got burned after coming from nowhere in 2016 to spend millions on late TV ads, have drilled operatives this time around on how they can empirically justify their effectiveness.

It amounts to a more premeditated, professional approach from Moskovitz compared to four years ago, when he has said he was “slow to act, which I regret deeply.”

Coronavirus or politics?

For all these billionaires’ best-laid plans to help-desk the Democratic Party’s digital woes before Election Day, Democrats fret that the coronavirus is dividing their attention and convincing some of them to reroute funds from political causes to charitable ones. Leaders of some Democratic groups, too, say privately they are concerned that the coronavirus could impact how much money their groups raise, either due to pinched net worths or endowments for the billionaire class, or because the rich feel a greater obligation to spend whatever money they do have on charitable work rather than on politics.

“You’re prioritizing your time to think right now, and the money follows your time. How much time do you have to think about Joe Biden?”

One fundraiser close to the Biden campaign said he worried about the “distraction” faced by people like Schmidt and Hoffman, who have both dedicated significant energy to pandemic relief efforts.

“You’re prioritizing your time to think right now, and the money follows your time,” said one Biden fundraiser. “How much time do you have to think about Joe Biden?”

Powell Jobs’s team has also suggested to some political groups that the coronavirus has made budgets tight and caused the Emerson Collective to rethink what precise efforts they will fund in 2020, sources say. Schmidt’s political aides, by contrast, have indicated that they are prepared to spend more money on political causes than they initially planned to.

The coronavirus has also, of course, put pressure on the Biden campaign, too. Asking donors to pay $2,800 for a Zoom call isn’t always an easy sell, fundraisers say. One Silicon Valley billionaire described the nascent Biden-tech relationship so far as “birds chirping.” And so tech leaders have been flooding Biden officials with their digital suggestions for how to campaign during the coronavirus — even inviting his digital director to appear on the hot new app for Silicon Valley insiders, Clubhouse.

Other outreach comes more formally. On a call last Thursday organized by the Biden campaign, a group of major tech leaders was greeted by a special guest: Hoffman. The megadonor, who could spend as much as $100 million this cycle, told those on the line that politics would be his No. 1 priority through Election Day — he’d even step out of board meetings for it.

But he had an exhortation to Silicon Valley product minds, one brimming with irony.

“We don’t need you to go and build anything new,” a person on the call recalled Hoffman saying. “There’s no time for that.”

In the last few months, the federal government has passed a series of relief packages to address the far-reaching effects of COVID-19. These packages represent the largest federal stimulus in United States history — including the historic $2 trillion CARES Act. State and local governments are now calling for further relief from the federal government to the tune of half a trillion dollars. Is this a good idea?

We’ll walk through the research from both sides. You decide where you land.





RELIEF TO DATE:

To date, congress has passed three phases of federal relief packages. The first was the ‘Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act,’ which provided $8.3 billion in emergency funding to federal agencies to respond to the crisis.

Second was the ‘Families First Coronavirus Response Act,’ which provided an additional $3.5 billion in funding for expanding SNAP food program, additional testing, expanding federal government’s support of Medicare, and expanding emergency family and medical leave.

Most recently was the ‘CARES Act,’ which was by far the largest package to date including over $2.2 trillion in funds. Check out our recent article if you want the breakdown.

MORE RELIEF:

Looking ahead, there is a general consensus in Washington that more aid will be needed. But how should this aid be distributed? One increasingly contentious proposal is whether to provide additional stimulus to state and local governments. State and local governments already received $150 billion as part of the CARES Act. However, proponents of additional aid say that these funds did not go far enough. Let's take a look at both sides.

THE COMMON THREAD:

Both sides say that additional relief is needed to support the economy in these unprecedented times.

FIND YOUR THREAD:

Supporters of additional state funding say that support from the federal government is the only way states will be able to continue to provide vital services. Opponents say that funds should go directly to businesses and specific sectors, rather than provide opportunities for states to get bailed out of budget issues incurred before the crisis.

The state of play : Trump is trying to beat back two sets of subpoenas — one from a trio of House committees and another from Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance .
Vance 's office was far more effective during today 's oral arguments than the House 's lawyer , whose disastrous appearance may have done his case real harm .
None of these subpoenas were delivered to Trump himself , but rather to his banks and accounting firms .
Still , Trump 's lawyers argue that none of those subpoenas are lawful — and that the president is largely immune from all non-impeachment investigations as long as he 's in office .
The court seemed unlikely to go that far , but also seemed unlikely to issue sweeping or unanimous rulings that would simply force the banks to promptly hand over Trump 's records .
Between the lines : Congressional investigations must have a `` legislative purpose '' and can ’ t be an exercise in law enforcement .
In this case , the House says records about Trump ’ s businesses and personal finances could help inform future legislation about foreign election interference , presidential disclosures or money laundering .
The court 's conservative justices were deeply skeptical of that rationale and pressed Douglas Letter , the House 's lawyer , to define some limits on Congress ’ subpoena power , to ensure congressional investigations wouldn ’ t be used to `` harass '' future presidents — which Trump says is happening here .
Letter repeatedly failed to articulate any such limits , either when pressed by conservatives or handed a lifeline by liberals .
Prosecutors , on the other hand , are clearly allowed to conduct law enforcement , and the court seemed more receptive to Vance 's subpoena .
The questioning during those arguments was much more focused on practicalities — how to set forth a standard that would not put the president above the law , but which would still ensure the president can do his job without being bogged down in legal proceedings .
That would not be the sort of blanket immunity Trump is asking for , but it would likely drag this particular case out longer , decreasing the likelihood that Trump 's financial records would be made public before the 2020 election .

Andrew Cuomo slammed the New York City Council ’ s move strip the New York Police Department of $ 1 billion in funding , questioning “ what it means ” and calling for concrete action .
“ I don ’ t know what it means , ” Cuomo said during a press briefing Wednesday . “ What does that mean ? Does this mean I am less safe ? Where did you take the billion dollars from ? Does it mean I am more safe ? Does it have any effect on police abuse ? I don ’ t know what it means . ”
NY CITY COUNCIL APPROVES SLASHING NYPD BUDGET BY $ 1 BILLION
Cuomo ’ s comments came after the New York City Council passed a budget Tuesday night that shifted $ 1 billion from the New York Police Department to programs that assist youth and community development .
Cuomo also took a veiled swipe at New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio , who confirmed Wednesday morning that the city would paint “ Black Lives Matter ” outside Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan in the coming days .
“ We ’ re going to paint ‘ Black Lives Matter ’ on the street in front of Trump HQ . Great , ” Cuomo said . “ From day one , I said I stand with Black Lives Matter . From Day one , I said I stand with protesters . I said great what this nation has done standing up after Mr. Floyd ’ s murder…I ’ m sorry it took so long . Why couldn ’ t we have done it after Eric Garner six years ago ? Or Rodney King 30 years ago ? But now we ’ re here . Great . ”
He added : “ Send that message to Mr. Trump , ‘ Black Lives Matter , ’ excessive force has to stop . Using the National Guard to stop protesters has to stop….Tell every police department in the United States of America enough is enough . Great . Great . Great .
“ You know what ’ s better ? ” He continued . “ Do something . Do something . Do something . ”
He added : “ You know where you start ? You start at home . You know where change starts . Change starts with the person in the mirror . ”
Cuomo went on to say that “ there is no respect and trust between the community and the police . ”
“ That ’ s what ’ s going on , ” Cuomo said . “ And if you don ’ t have respect and trust , you have nothing . It does not work . It is like a marriage .
“ The community has said the relationship with the police department doesn ’ t work , and if it doesn ’ t work for the community , then it doesn ’ t work , ” he continued . “ You have to redesign the whole relationship . ”
TRUMP BLASTS DE BLASIO FOR PLANS TO PAINT 'BLACK LIVES MATTER ' OUTSIDE TRUMP TOWER
Cuomo also said the police department was designed `` 50 years ago '' and with `` a totally different mindset , '' while noting it can be “ whatever the community wants it to be , ” and that it is “ paid for by the taxpayers . ”
“ Bring the police , the politicians , the community together . Start with a blank piece of paper , ” Cuomo said . “ It ’ s going to be a hard conversation . ”
Last month , Cuomo signed an executive order that included a statewide ban on chokeholds and an appointment of a special prosecutor to review cases of police killing unarmed individuals . The legislation also made fake race-based 911 calls a crime .
Cuomo also signed an executive order that would withhold funds from police departments that were not directed toward reforms . The order required police departments across the state to work with communities to enact further reforms . That order required that every city and county had to “ reinvent ” and “ modernize ” its police strategies by April 1 . If a locality failed to do so by the deadline next year , the area would not be eligible for state funding .
“ Redesign the police departments and pass a law on the new plan of the police departments by April or they don ’ t get state funding , ” Cuomo again explained Wednesday . “ Why did you do that ? Because I knew they weren ’ t going to have a real conversation , and I wanted to create the vehicle where they would have to have the real conversation . ”
Some of the questions Cuomo proposed be included in “ the real conversation ” are : “ What is your use of force policy ? What does it mean to demilitarize the police ? How many staff does it need ? What functions do you want it to perform ? What should the budget be ? What do you mean by defund the police .
“ And then get it passed by the city council , so it ’ s not just what the mayor thinks , ” Cuomo said , noting that the more than 500 police departments across the state of New York are all “ a little different. ” “ What Buffalo wants is different from what New York City wants . ''
After the New York City Council passed its budget Tuesday , it said in a statement that the city 's 2021 budget will include $ 837 million in cuts and transfers to the New York Police Department ( NYPD ) expense budget , which removes $ 1 billion from the NYPD ’ s spending when combined with associated costs .
The amount is far less than what some protesters demanded . Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , D-N.Y. , said earlier that $ 1.5 billion in cuts would not be enough .
De Blasio , on Wednesday , touted the “ profound change ” in the budget , noting that the city is “ taking money from the police and putting it into youth initiatives , ” while also taking other measures , such as “ getting rid of solitary confinement in our jails . ”

But instead , they ’ re flocking to the latest product peddled by large banking interests , even though they look almost exactly like the mortgage-backed securities that were a primary driver of the financial crisis . These new securities , backed by rental payments , also have real-world implications for millions of renters , who could end up turning in their monthly checks to Wall Street-based absentee slumlords .
Over the past couple of years , private equity firms and hedge funds have bought up over 200,000 single-family homes , mostly discounted foreclosed properties in communities wrecked by the housing crash , such as Phoenix , Atlanta , Tampa , Sacramento , Los Angeles and Riverside , Calif . They have spent billions to scoop up these vacant homes at fire-sale prices , renovate them , and rent them out , promising investors double-digit annual returns on the rental revenue . Private equity firms like Blackstone , which owns more than 40,000 single-family homes , think they can build an entirely new asset class out of this scheme , controlling the rental market for single-family homes . The irony is rich : Wall Street created the conditions for millions of foreclosures , then they sweep in to buy up the homes and rent them out , often to the same people they kicked onto the street .
In order for this to work , firms need cash to outbid the competition . So Blackstone teamed with Deutsche Bank , Credit Suisse and JPMorgan Chase to put together the first-ever rental revenue bond , named “ Invitation Homes 2013-SFR1. ” Basically , Blackstone took out mortgages with the banks on 3,207 of its rental properties , in exchange for $ 479 million in cash , and they will forward rental payments to the bondholders to pay back the loan .
Blackstone plans to use the $ 479 million to purchase more homes . This facilitates the single-family rental scheme , by giving firms a fresh source of cheap money to spend on cornering rental markets , wrestling them away from traditional mom-and-pop rental management companies . The entire industry has looked hopefully upon the Blackstone effort as something they can replicate . One investment firm president remarked , “ We ’ re rooting for them. ” Investors are eyeing the securities as well : With interest rates still minuscule , they want to invest in something that can guarantee them a higher yield .
Like mortgage-backed securities , the bonds would get sold in tranches , with the senior levels getting rental revenue first , and the junior tranches taking the rest . Rating agencies like Kroll , Morningstar and Moody ’ s have blessed the deal , presenting the senior tranches with a triple-A rating , essentially labeling it as perfectly safe for investors . You ’ ll remember that mortgage-backed securities were bestowed triple-A ratings during the housing bubble , and that this spurred massive purchases , fueling demand for more and more home loans to create more securities . You can see the same thing happening in the rental market if these securities catch on . In fact , while the most attractive foreclosed properties have already been snapped up , homebuilders are constructing new properties specifically for single-family rentals . Some analysts are concerned that this gold rush will create a new housing bubble in the communities where Wall Street firms are purchasing homes .
Let me be clear : A rise in renting would not be a bad trend , especially if it created a reasonable alternative to buying a home . The consequences of not paying the rent are certainly lesser than defaulting on a mortgage . And we ’ ve seen how homeowners have been abused in countless ways . A robust single-family rental market would provide more housing choices in attractive locations . And viable rental options could theoretically put a check on bubbles – if home prices get too high , people will just turn to renting – making overall housing costs more affordable .
Additionally , securitization in the abstract is not necessarily something to fear . When done right , it efficiently allocates capital to productive investment opportunities that could even have social value . For example , the solar power company SolarCity just announced solar securities , which could boost the renewable energy space .
But securitizing rental revenue is beset with unknowns . The rating agency Fitch underscored many of these concerns when they justified their opposition to rating the Blackstone bond .
First , until the financial crisis , Wall Street firms had no record managing rental properties , and it ’ s unclear whether they would be able to quickly fill vacancies , negotiate local rent laws and handle repairs . Because the purchases are concentrated in a handful of metropolitan regions , local variables ( like communities not wanting Wall Street to buy up all the rental properties ) could have an outsize impact . And single-family rentals could fare poorly in an economic downturn , if prospective renters lost their jobs and could not afford to live on their own . With Wall Street owning the newly vacant properties , they could react to a downturn by liquidating them to pay back the bondholders . “ The impact of a large scale listing at the neighborhood level could have a significant impact on market clearing prices , ” Fitch writes ; in other words , the market could crash under the weight of the mass sell-off , with an impact far beyond the individual properties . Just as securitization inflated and collapsed the residential housing market , it could do the same for rentals .
The consequences for 14 million single-family renters in America could be worse . Fears that Wall Street firms would try to trim costs by ignoring maintenance and upkeep have so far been realized . As Ben Hallman at the Huffington Post recently detailed , Wall Street-owned rental homes are riddled with mechanical and plumbing problems . The firms basically freshened up foreclosed properties with a coat of paint and rented them out , ignoring serious deficiencies like broken toilets and even vermin infestations . And predictably , the landlords are impossible to reach to get repairs done . “ I 've been renting homes for 15 years and I 've never had a landlord be this ridiculous about getting stuff repaired , ” said one renter of Invitation Homes , Blackstone ’ s single-family rental subsidiary .
The problem mirrors issues that bedeviled securitized mortgages . In that instance , lenders had no concern for the well-being of the homeowners , because they sold off their loans to other investors . Here , Blackstone passes off the day-to-day operations to local property managers , who get paid whether they perform repairs or not . In fact , Wall Street firms apply plenty of pressure to fix up homes cheaply and quickly , to get them in shape for rental and kick-start the monthly payments . So there ’ s no reason for anyone in the process to care about quality .
Strong tenant laws are supposed to counteract this slumlord misbehavior . But what if investment firms corner the market on rental homes and use political influence to subvert those laws ? That ’ s already happening in places like Huber Heights , Ohio , where Magnetar Capital now owns nearly 10 percent of the homes . They have appealed to the city to cut their property taxes , a windfall that would save Magnetar $ 1.39 million .
The potential for abuse is high , because there ’ s so much money on the line . As institutional investors increase their purchases in cities , they muscle out traditional homebuyers for the scarce properties available . And the added market share allows them to be even more brazen . Residents of the largest apartment complex in Manhattan , Stuyvesant Town , are facing large mid-lease rent increases after ownership reverted to CWCapital Asset Management . You can easily see a trend here , as Wall Street firms use their wealth and power to mute opposition from city councils and demand more from renters .
Plus there ’ s the concern that securitization of rental payments will lead to the same kind of risky , illegal practices we saw with securitization of mortgages . Nobody should welcome a return of innovations like CDOs ( where the riskiest tranches get sliced up and repackaged as “ safe ” securities ) or adjustable payments ( what if renters were sold “ teaser ” rates on their monthly payments that reset to prices they couldn ’ t afford ? ) . And nobody wants to think about the strong-arm tactics that would be applied to force payments out of tenants , regardless of the circumstances . This is a rerun , and the first movie ended rather badly .
If Americans weren ’ t seduced by the mythical dream of homeownership and turned to renting , that could certainly be positive . But it ’ s hard to trust that the same financial titans who blew up the economy won ’ t distort and pervert the rental market to such a degree that people simply looking for a place to live won ’ t again get squeezed by Wall Street greed .","You’d think that investors would run away from a new Wall Street innovation as fast as Congress runs away from a good idea.

With Wall Street owning the newly vacant properties, they could react to a downturn by liquidating them to pay back the bondholders. “The impact of a large scale listing at the neighborhood level could have a significant impact on market clearing prices,” Fitch writes; in other words, the market could crash under the weight of the mass sell-off, with an impact far beyond the individual properties. Just as securitization inflated and collapsed the residential housing market, it could do the same for rentals.

The consequences for 14 million single-family renters in America could be worse. Fears that Wall Street firms would try to trim costs by ignoring maintenance and upkeep have so far been realized. As Ben Hallman at the Huffington Post recently detailed, Wall Street-owned rental homes are riddled with mechanical and plumbing problems. The firms basically freshened up foreclosed properties with a coat of paint and rented them out, ignoring serious deficiencies like broken toilets and even vermin infestations. And predictably, the landlords are impossible to reach to get repairs done. “I've been renting homes for 15 years and I've never had a landlord be this ridiculous about getting stuff repaired,” said one renter of Invitation Homes, Blackstone’s single-family rental subsidiary.

The problem mirrors issues that bedeviled securitized mortgages. In that instance, lenders had no concern for the well-being of the homeowners, because they sold off their loans to other investors. Here, Blackstone passes off the day-to-day operations to local property managers, who get paid whether they perform repairs or not. In fact, Wall Street firms apply plenty of pressure to fix up homes cheaply and quickly, to get them in shape for rental and kick-start the monthly payments. So there’s no reason for anyone in the process to care about quality.

Strong tenant laws are supposed to counteract this slumlord misbehavior. But what if investment firms corner the market on rental homes and use political influence to subvert those laws? That’s already happening in places like Huber Heights, Ohio, where Magnetar Capital now owns nearly 10 percent of the homes. They have appealed to the city to cut their property taxes, a windfall that would save Magnetar $1.39 million.

The potential for abuse is high, because there’s so much money on the line. As institutional investors increase their purchases in cities, they muscle out traditional homebuyers for the scarce properties available. And the added market share allows them to be even more brazen. Residents of the largest apartment complex in Manhattan, Stuyvesant Town, are facing large mid-lease rent increases after ownership reverted to CWCapital Asset Management. You can easily see a trend here, as Wall Street firms use their wealth and power to mute opposition from city councils and demand more from renters.

Plus there’s the concern that securitization of rental payments will lead to the same kind of risky, illegal practices we saw with securitization of mortgages. Nobody should welcome a return of innovations like CDOs (where the riskiest tranches get sliced up and repackaged as “safe” securities) or adjustable payments (what if renters were sold “teaser” rates on their monthly payments that reset to prices they couldn’t afford?). And nobody wants to think about the strong-arm tactics that would be applied to force payments out of tenants, regardless of the circumstances. This is a rerun, and the first movie ended rather badly.

If Americans weren’t seduced by the mythical dream of homeownership and turned to renting, that could certainly be positive. But it’s hard to trust that the same financial titans who blew up the economy won’t distort and pervert the rental market to such a degree that people simply looking for a place to live won’t again get squeezed by Wall Street greed.",www.salon.com,left,J7YXLfAMyoIrIZV5

Dracula and his cursed kin are the undead 1 percent and act accordingly : terrorizing villages , murdering peasants , siphoning off others ’ lifeblood , and turning up their aquiline noses at the slightest hint of dissent . Ad Policy
An entire cottage industry operates around their stories , and vampire lore does not always confine itself to the page . In the 17th century , the very real and very sadistic Countess Bathory—she of Hungarian legend and historical infamy—is said to have broken the bodies of more than 650 village girls and bathed in serf blood to retain her youth . For that , history remembers her with a strange sort of fondness : as an unfathomably wealthy , castle-dwelling noblewoman always depicted as lavishly dressed and dripping in jewels . She was monstrous in an elegant sort of way , the kind that inspires gothic novels and Swedish black metal records . Vituperative inhumanity , but made fashionable .
Vampires ’ modern-day counterparts , on the other hand , leave much to be desired from an aesthetic standpoint . Unlike the ancient Romanian moroi , Irish dearg-due , or Ghanaian sasabonsam , today ’ s vampires are parasitic new money . Vulgar , ugly , and smug , their wrists are cluttered with hideous statement watches , their torsos clad in power suits or , worse , upmarket hipster threads . Some call them vulture capitalists , after the great birds who feast on carrion . While catchy , this term doesn ’ t quite fit ; these monsters do not focus on the dead—they go after the living . They run hedge funds , trade stocks , and manage private equity firms , flush with generational wealth but always hungry for more . Instead of hot blood , these fancy fiends hunt for cold cash—and much like their spiritual predecessors , care little for how others must suffer in their pursuit thereof .

They ’ ve plundered every industry available , and , as of late , have trained their eyes on the crumbling edifice of digital media . Unlike the countess , who secreted away the evidence of her cruelty in a dungeon , this new generation commits their horrors in the open .
Their latest victim is Deadspin—which was ostensibly a sports website , but ultimately more of an offbeat culture publication with a penchant for football-themed mockery and commemorating various guys . Earlier in 2019 , Great Hill Partners , a private equity firm , acquired a number of former Gawker Media properties , including Gizmodo , Deadspin , Splinter , Jezebel , Kotaku , The Root , and The Onion , from Univision , who ’ d originally purchased the portfolio following Gawker Media ’ s 2016 vivisection cum bankruptcy . Great Hill slapped together a new media company they called G/O Media , hired a bunch of aging Forbes bros to run the show , and set to work dismantling their new purchases . The first to fall was Splinter , a razor-sharp politics site that kept the rebellious spirit of Gawker alive ; on October 10 , a memo went out that the site was being shut down and seven of its staffers were being laid off . Two weeks later , another memo was sent , this time to Deadspin ’ s staff , ordering them to “ stick to sports , ” and a beloved longtime editor was fired for resisting the mandate ; the writers and editors called G/O ’ s bluff and quit en masse .
The entire tragedy played out on social media , specifically on Twitter , and watching Deadspin collapse in real time was both awful and inspiring for those who have already been through the digital meat grinder . It felt different than the hemorrhages at Vice , Buzzfeed , and so many others ; those happened suddenly , without much warning , and the workers were rendered powerless to stop the cull . The layoffs were handled in-house , with as much sterility as HR could muster . All that the public saw was a sudden influx of “ I guess I ’ m freelance now ” tweets . All the viscera were carefully packed away in Kafkaesque severance packages and non-disclosure agreements .
But with Deadspin , the axe didn ’ t fall swiftly . The staffers knew that the worst was yet to come but didn ’ t allow themselves to be led quietly to their doom . With their union ’ s backing , they resisted . They yanked their heads off the block , and walked away with middle fingers held aloft . In the spirit of Gawker ’ s very public 2015 unionization campaign , former reporter Laura Wagner ’ s investigation into their craven new CEO , and former Deadspin EIC Megan Greenwell ’ s magisterial explanation of what went wrong , they took on this challenge the way longtime readers have come to expect : bravely , irreverently , with the most beautiful “ Fuck me ? Hey , buddy , fuck YOU ” energy imaginable . As site founder Will Leitch said on Twitter , “ They refused to give in to the bad guys. ” Current Issue View our current issue
For now , Deadspin is still technically alive , albeit in a somnambulant fugue state . It likely won ’ t last long : Vampires and zombies are seldom found in the same place , and one can only imagine how G/O management will react to the relentless and deserved storm of criticism that greets their every boneheaded move . Vampires prefer their victims to be left lifeless . If the usual pattern holds , G/O will suck out what it can , and move on . Your favorite website could be next , and one can only hope they ’ ll be able to take a stand the way the wonderful freaks at Deadspin did .
This wrongheaded corporate plundering did not start and will not stop with Deadspin ; vampires are forever in need of new hosts . Private-equity firms have quietly taken over a large swath of the American economy : buying up companies , selling them off for parts , then stealing away unscathed . There ’ s a reason presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren has been so outspoken against them . Private equity is a danger to the free press , and a scourge upon the already weakened state of journalism . In just under two years , these firms have turned LA Weekly into a lifeless husk , ravaged The Denver Post , gutted Sports Illustrated , and silently strangled dozens of local newspapers across the country .
Media is far from their only target , though private equity does have a taste for the most vulnerable . Over the past decade , they have killed 1.3 million retail jobs , and the Los Angeles Times reports that 10 of the 14 largest retail chain bankruptcies since 2012 were at private equity-acquired chains . A famous example of their brutal negligence is Toys “ R ” Us , which was driven into bankruptcy after being acquired in 2014 by a pair of private equity firms , KKR and Bain Capital . Some 33,000 workers were laid off , and it took months—and a class-action lawsuit—before workers got the severance payouts they were owed . Today , Bain Capital holds over $ 100 billion in assets , and continues to seek new victims .
Not even the ill and injured are safe from this particular strain of supernatural avarice . The Carlyle Group , a massive private equity firm , came under fire in 2018 when conditions at ManorCare , a nursing home chain that it had purchased in 2007 and driven into bankruptcy , were revealed to have been so understaffed that residents were frequently left to wallow in their own filth . Some reported rooms overrun with roaches and ants , while others sustained grievous injuries due to neglect . In 2018 , Hahnemann University Hospital , a 171-year-old facility in Center City Philadelphia , was purchased by Joel Freedman ’ s Paladin Healthcare via a loan from MidCap Financial , a subsidiary of the notorious private-equity firm Apollo Global Management , whose founder Leon Black was allegedly friend of billionaire sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein and who up until recently counted Blackwater USA—the architects of a horrific massacre of Iraqi civilians in 2007—among its many holdings .
Freedman ushered the hospital—which is Drexel University ’ s main teaching hospital , employs thousands of unionized staff , and provides care to low-income , underserved , predominantly black and Latinx communities—into bankruptcy , and announced plans to sell its real estate to the highest bidder , hastening gentrification in the area . Locals are devastated at the prospect and have staged several protests . Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders held a rally at the hospital , calling it “ crazy ” that “ a hospital is being converted into a real estate opportunity in order to make some wealthy guy even more money , ignoring the health-care needs of thousands of people. ” The hospital stopped accepting patients in July .
Private equity has wiped out entire grocery chains . It controls the price of calling our loved ones in prison . It profits off the bail bonds and payday loans that extort poor communities of color . It bought the Playboy Mansion ( for better or worse ) . It kneecapped millennial fashion staple Forever 21 . It even killed Necco wafers—and left the crumbs for the rats . Private equity vampires are gruesome avatars for capitalism itself : They are rapacious , and roam the earth draining communities of their livelihoods . As anyone who ’ s ever seen a vampire movie or read an Anne Rice ( or Twilight ) novel knows , vampires stop at nothing until they are satisfied—and this 21st-century subspecies will never suck down enough capital to fill the gaping holes where their souls should be . There is no happy ending here , unless a ruthless new era of regulation swoops in to put a wooden stake through the heart of private equity .","Ready to fight back?

The first to fall was Splinter, a razor-sharp politics site that kept the rebellious spirit of Gawker alive; on October 10, a memo went out that the site was being shut down and seven of its staffers were being laid off. Two weeks later, another memo was sent, this time to Deadspin’s staff, ordering them to “stick to sports,” and a beloved longtime editor was fired for resisting the mandate; the writers and editors called G/O’s bluff and quit en masse.

The entire tragedy played out on social media, specifically on Twitter, and watching Deadspin collapse in real time was both awful and inspiring for those who have already been through the digital meat grinder. It felt different than the hemorrhages at Vice, Buzzfeed, and so many others; those happened suddenly, without much warning, and the workers were rendered powerless to stop the cull. The layoffs were handled in-house, with as much sterility as HR could muster. All that the public saw was a sudden influx of “I guess I’m freelance now” tweets. All the viscera were carefully packed away in Kafkaesque severance packages and non-disclosure agreements.

But with Deadspin, the axe didn’t fall swiftly. The staffers knew that the worst was yet to come but didn’t allow themselves to be led quietly to their doom. With their union’s backing, they resisted. They yanked their heads off the block, and walked away with middle fingers held aloft. In the spirit of Gawker’s very public 2015 unionization campaign, former reporter Laura Wagner’s investigation into their craven new CEO, and former Deadspin EIC Megan Greenwell’s magisterial explanation of what went wrong, they took on this challenge the way longtime readers have come to expect: bravely, irreverently, with the most beautiful “Fuck me? Hey, buddy, fuck YOU” energy imaginable. As site founder Will Leitch said on Twitter, “They refused to give in to the bad guys.” Current Issue View our current issue

For now, Deadspin is still technically alive, albeit in a somnambulant fugue state. It likely won’t last long: Vampires and zombies are seldom found in the same place, and one can only imagine how G/O management will react to the relentless and deserved storm of criticism that greets their every boneheaded move. Vampires prefer their victims to be left lifeless. If the usual pattern holds, G/O will suck out what it can, and move on. Your favorite website could be next, and one can only hope they’ll be able to take a stand the way the wonderful freaks at Deadspin did.

This wrongheaded corporate plundering did not start and will not stop with Deadspin; vampires are forever in need of new hosts. Private-equity firms have quietly taken over a large swath of the American economy: buying up companies, selling them off for parts, then stealing away unscathed. There’s a reason presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren has been so outspoken against them. Private equity is a danger to the free press, and a scourge upon the already weakened state of journalism. In just under two years, these firms have turned LA Weekly into a lifeless husk, ravaged The Denver Post, gutted Sports Illustrated, and silently strangled dozens of local newspapers across the country.

Media is far from their only target, though private equity does have a taste for the most vulnerable. Over the past decade, they have killed 1.3 million retail jobs, and the Los Angeles Times reports that 10 of the 14 largest retail chain bankruptcies since 2012 were at private equity-acquired chains. A famous example of their brutal negligence is Toys “R” Us, which was driven into bankruptcy after being acquired in 2014 by a pair of private equity firms, KKR and Bain Capital. Some 33,000 workers were laid off, and it took months—and a class-action lawsuit—before workers got the severance payouts they were owed. Today, Bain Capital holds over $100 billion in assets, and continues to seek new victims.

Not even the ill and injured are safe from this particular strain of supernatural avarice. The Carlyle Group, a massive private equity firm, came under fire in 2018 when conditions at ManorCare, a nursing home chain that it had purchased in 2007 and driven into bankruptcy, were revealed to have been so understaffed that residents were frequently left to wallow in their own filth. Some reported rooms overrun with roaches and ants, while others sustained grievous injuries due to neglect. In 2018, Hahnemann University Hospital, a 171-year-old facility in Center City Philadelphia, was purchased by Joel Freedman’s Paladin Healthcare via a loan from MidCap Financial, a subsidiary of the notorious private-equity firm Apollo Global Management, whose founder Leon Black was allegedly friend of billionaire sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein and who up until recently counted Blackwater USA—the architects of a horrific massacre of Iraqi civilians in 2007—among its many holdings.

Freedman ushered the hospital—which is Drexel University’s main teaching hospital, employs thousands of unionized staff, and provides care to low-income, underserved, predominantly black and Latinx communities—into bankruptcy, and announced plans to sell its real estate to the highest bidder, hastening gentrification in the area. Locals are devastated at the prospect and have staged several protests. Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders held a rally at the hospital, calling it “crazy” that “a hospital is being converted into a real estate opportunity in order to make some wealthy guy even more money, ignoring the health-care needs of thousands of people.” The hospital stopped accepting patients in July.

Private equity has wiped out entire grocery chains. It controls the price of calling our loved ones in prison. It profits off the bail bonds and payday loans that extort poor communities of color. It bought the Playboy Mansion (for better or worse). It kneecapped millennial fashion staple Forever 21. It even killed Necco wafers—and left the crumbs for the rats. Private equity vampires are gruesome avatars for capitalism itself: They are rapacious, and roam the earth draining communities of their livelihoods. As anyone who’s ever seen a vampire movie or read an Anne Rice (or Twilight) novel knows, vampires stop at nothing until they are satisfied—and this 21st-century subspecies will never suck down enough capital to fill the gaping holes where their souls should be. There is no happy ending here, unless a ruthless new era of regulation swoops in to put a wooden stake through the heart of private equity.",www.thenation.com,left,XSbAfSpjQkyrKPA9

It’s the (global) economy, stupid

While not doing hedge fund manager-level well, many Americans are better off as well. US household income is up for the second straight year, and unemployment is at record lows.

There is no doubt US markets and the economy are doing well, but that’s also true for the rest of the world. In fact, in many places, it’s going better.

President Trump said Tuesday during a Fox News virtual townhall that he wants the country ’ s economy re-opened by Easter amid questions over how long people should stay home and businesses should remain closed to slow the spread of coronavirus .
Speaking from the Rose Garden alongside others on his coronavirus taskforce , Trump said he `` would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter . '' The holiday this year lands on April 12 .
Trump argued he doesn ’ t want “ to turn the country off ” and see a continued economic downfall from the pandemic . He also said he worries the U.S. will see `` suicides by the thousands '' if coronavirus devastates the economy .

`` We lose thousands and thousands of people a year to the flu . We do n't turn the country off , ” Trump said during the interview .
Trump added : “ We lose much more than that to automobile accidents . We do n't call up the automobile companies and say stop making cars . We have to get back to work . ”

“ I can tell you that at no point has the White House Coronavirus Task Force discussed what some people call a nationwide lockdown , or as you describe a stay at home order , ” Pence said .
Pence also noted that the federal government sent 2,000 ventilators from the national stockpile to the state of New York , which has become the epicenter of coronavirus in the U.S. , and vowed to send 2,000 more on Wednesday .

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo had requested some 15,000 ventilators to deal with the outbreak in the state . Both de Blasio and Cuomo have repeatedly sounded the alarm on the shortage of ventilators in New York City hospitals , as many COVID-19 patients need the machines to help them breathe .

Let 's consider the unfolding debacle in Italy as an urgent cautionary tale , relayed by an Italian journalist :
Until last week , the Italian public health care system had the capacity to care for everyone . Our country has universal health care , so patients aren ’ t turned away from hospitals here . But in a matter of days , the system was being felled by a virus that I , and many other Italians , had failed to take seriously ... So here ’ s my warning for the United States : It didn ’ t have to come to this . We of course couldn ’ t stop the emergence of a previously unknown and deadly virus . But we could have mitigated the situation we are now in , in which people who could have been saved are dying . I , and too many others , could have taken a simple yet morally loaded action : We could have stayed home . What has happened in Italy shows that less-than-urgent appeals to the public by the government to slightly change habits regarding social interactions aren ’ t enough when the terrible outcomes they are designed to prevent are not yet apparent ; when they become evident , it ’ s generally too late to act .
I and many other Italians just didn ’ t see the need to change our routines for a threat we could not see . Italy has now been in lockdown since March 9 ; it took weeks after the virus first appeared here to realize that severe measures were absolutely necessary . According to several data scientists , Italy is about 10 days ahead of Spain , Germany , and France in the epidemic progression , and 13 to 16 days ahead of the United Kingdom and the United States . That means those countries have the opportunity to take measures that today may look excessive and disproportionate , yet from the future , where I am now , are perfectly rational in order to avoid a health care system collapse .
Here 's Newt Gingrich issuing similar warnings from Rome . it 's going to get significantly worse here in the coming days . Indeed , a major contributing factor to Italy 's lethal mess was the population 's cavalier attitude in the earliest days of the crisis :
“ They cited irresponsible behavior by many citizens , who despite the earlier warnings not to gather in large numbers , headed to beaches or ski resorts , and hung out together in town squares , especially after the closure of schools. ” https : //t.co/crTv8hmwCZ — Yashar Ali ? ?

The opposite was true in other places , like South Korea , where the response was serious , coordinated , and effective . Relative progress is undeniable , and lives have been saved . Compare and contrast :

South Korea and Italy offer two bookends of how a country can tackle the coronavirus . Their divergent experiences hold urgent lessons for the U.S. and other democracies where the pandemic is at an earlier stage . Seoul , accepting the illness had arrived , kept its borders open and aggressively tracked down the infected using data and extensive tests . Rome , after escalating attempts to reduce travel and social interactions , quarantined the whole country , while only screening people once they had shown symptoms . The countries have two of the biggest coronavirus outbreaks outside China . But South Korea ’ s known infections are now stabilizing at around 8,000 , whereas Italy ’ s are rising relentlessly past 17,000 . South Korea has 67 deaths as of Friday . Italy ’ s death toll was a far higher 1,266 by late Friday , because the virus has hit its large and vulnerable elderly population and overwhelmed hospitals in some areas .
A few points : By far , the most vulnerable populations are the elderly and people with underlying health conditions . Even if younger people do n't believe they 're likely to interact with these populations , the virus is so contagious that passing it along by breathing on shared surfaces , especially in public places , can be a risk . Visualize the spread of the disease here ( seriously , watch and share ) , and read this story about how one single person refusing to comply with guidelines ended up infecting approximately 1,000 other people . Many young , healthy people who contract Coronavirus are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms . But they can easily yet unwittingly spread the disease to peers or others , who could then in turn pass it along to expanding circles of people . This is profoundly serious :
Here ’ s something that ’ s absolutely terrifying : a comparison of the age distributions of Covid-19 cases in Italy , where they are only testing people who show symptoms , and S. Korea , which has broad testing . A whole lot of 20-29yos out there who feel just fine but are v contagious . pic.twitter.com/BU96h3VKUc — Mark Byrne ( @ markwby ) March 14 , 2020

Led by an 8.5 percent drop in China 's Shanghai composite index , U.S. and global stock markets took a dive Monday . Shortly after opening , the Dow Jones index fell by more than 1,000 points , or 5 percent . The Dow then zigzagged to close at 15,871 , losing about 3.6 percent of its value .
About an hour into the trading session , the benchmark index had recovered somewhat to a loss of 400 points , or a little more than 2 percent of its value . But the roller coaster continued , with stocks incurring new losses in the afternoon . Both the Nasdaq index and the Standard and Poor 's 500 index lost nearly 4 percent .
`` The 10 sectors in the S & P 500 headed lower , '' the AP reports , `` with energy stocks recording the biggest decline , 5.2 percent , amid a continued slump in the price of oil . The sector is down almost 25 percent this year . ''
`` Panic spread to European markets , with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 off as much as 3 percent in early London trading . All major bourses were off a similar amount . The index has shed over $ 1 trillion in market value in August so far . `` Japan 's Nikkei 225 index also finished at its lowest closing level since February 23 , as a double whammy of China-related fears and a rejuvenated yen brought the bourse down by its biggest one-day drop in more than 2 years . ''
Of course , in the U.S. , all this comes after a brutal week on Wall Street . On Friday , the Dow closed 531 points lower — in correction territory for the first time since 2011 .
We 'll update this post often as the markets take in all this news .
Update at 4:05 p.m . ET . Market Staggers To A Close
The Dow Jones index has closed at 15,871.28 — a drop of 588.47 , or 3.58 percent , for the day . The benchmark started Monday 's session at 16,459.75 and fell more than 1,000 points before recovering some of those losses .
The final hour of a long day is beginning . More than a few traders and investors are no doubt looking forward to happy hour after the stock market closes at 4 p.m . ET .
And it appears they 're going to need the barkeep to pour heavy : Prices are dropping fast again . The Dow Jones industrial average is down about 600 points to about 15,860 . That 's about a 3.6 percent drop .
The fade is disappointing after the midday comeback . The Dow had managed to scratch its way back to only about a 100-point loss , but now it 's down , down , down .
The market close should be interesting . Get out your popcorn .
Update at 2 p.m . ET . How Will The Markets Close ?
Late summer is a popular time for roller coaster rides , but it 's much more fun at an amusement park than on Wall Street .
Up and down , up and down , lots of screaming — that 's the stock market this summer . Back in mid-May , the Dow Jones industrial average was up at nearly 18,300 . And then wheeeeee , down we went in early June . Back up again in late June , another decline , then a July peak of 18,120 .
August brought mostly dips — until suddenly , that stomach-turning , hands-in-the-air screaming plunge began in recent days . As investors settle in for the final two hours of trading on this bleak day , the Dow is down about 350 points , or 2.1 percent , to about 16,100 .
Very hard to say right now how the wild ride will end at 4 p.m. We might be laughing and relieved at the finish — or crying and calling for our mommies .
U.S. stocks , and even some commodities , are starting to look a little better as the trading day continues . When the stock market first opened , the Dow Jones industrial average took a swan dive , falling about 1,000 points within minutes . But as of the midpoint in the day , the average was down only about 130 , at about 16,330 .
Normally , a hundred-point drop would be seen as bad news , but after the morning 's wild plunge , investors took some comfort in seeing the Dow claw its way back .
For commodities , prices are still falling , but at least there were some signs of a small rebound . For example , both corn and wheat ticked up a little , even though prices remain far below where they were in recent years . Lumber seems to be the day 's biggest loser with prices down about 10 percent .
Update at 12:06 p.m . ET . Stocks Around The World Are Down :
If misery loves company , then here 's some comfort : Stock prices all over the world are down sharply too .
This morning , the U.S. stocks lost nearly 3 percent of their value , but European and Asian stocks did even worse . Their trading hours are over for Monday , and now their investors can lick their wounds and ponder what 's next for the week .
The STOXX Europe 600 , a measure of European stocks , fell more than 4 percent , while the Shanghai Composite dropped 8.5 percent , marking the biggest one-day drop there since 2007 .
Update at 11:16 a.m . ET . How Will This Affect Consumer Demand ?
Consumer demand has been slow to grow throughout this six-year economic recovery . So now the big question that economists are pondering is : Will cheaper food and fuel this fall help consumers spend more for back-to-school and holiday shopping ?
Or will the negative `` wealth shock '' discourage them ? In other words , will families look at their 401 ( k ) retirement savings and think , `` Yikes . We 'd better not spend much because we 're not as well-off as we thought '' ?
This year 's low inflation and low interest rates are good spurs to consumer spending . But shrinking savings and frightening headlines are certainly not confidence builders . Economists have to try to get into consumers ' heads and wallets to figure out how they will interpret the events of August . Will it be a signal to shop more or spend less ?
Meanwhile , the stock market continues to rattle nerves . Pretty much everything that helps your savings — such as stock mutual funds and 10-year Treasury yields — are down on this difficult morning . The Dow Jones industrial average is off roughly 450 points to around 16,000 . That 's down nearly 3 percent for the day .
Update at 11:08 a.m . ET . On The Positive Side , Gas Prices Are Down :
The stock market rout may not be doing much for retirement savings , but the oil price plunge may do a lot to help consumers — or at least those who drive . According to Gasbuddy.com , a website that tracks gasoline prices , the pump price is falling , down nearly 2 cents a gallon since Sunday .
The national average price is now $ 2.59 , nearly 85 cents a gallon less than on this same date last year .
Back in the summer of 2008 , the average price was $ 4.10 . If you adjusted that for inflation , the price would be about $ 4.54 . In other words , you are actually spending about $ 2 a gallon less than in the summer of 2008 . That 's bound to help with this year 's back-to-school spending .
Unless , of course , you happen to be trying to hang on to an oil field job .
Most headlines are focused on the stock market rout , but the bigger news may actually be about commodity prices . Pretty much anything you can buy in bulk — corn , copper , wheat , oil , aluminum — is way down .
In fact , the Bloomberg Commodity Index , which includes prices for 22 raw materials , sank to the lowest level since August 1999 . As of 10:30 a.m. , the index was down nearly 2 percent to 173.66 . Over the past year , the index has dropped by more than 31 percent .
So if you are a miner , driller or farmer , 2015 is turning into a year you 'd rather forget . Lots of those workers already are losing jobs , from the West Virginia coal mines to the Texas oil fields . In the wheat fields of Oklahoma and Kansas , farmers are facing much tougher times .
After a frightful opening , stock prices appear to be rebounding , a hopeful sign to many .
Within a few minutes of opening , the Dow Jones industrial average had dropped about 1,000 points . It had never before lost even 800 points in one day . But then again , the DJIA has been higher recently than any time in history , so as a percentage drop , this plunge was no record .
Following that initial , stomach-turning drop , prices improved . The DJIA was off only about 450 to around 16,000 within 45 minutes of opening . That 's still down nearly 3 percent from Friday 's depressing close , but at least the plunge stopped .
No matter how you look at it , this has been a terrible month for stocks . On Twitter , a lot of people are using the # BlackMonday hashtag — a reference to the `` black '' trading days first made famous in 1929 when Wall Street crashed . That may be a little melodramatic , but without question , it 's a tough time for nervous investors .
As The New York Times puts it , the big question about all this is whether it portends a long-term slump for the world 's economies .
`` Philippe Gijsels , head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets in Brussels , said there was no sense that an apocalyptic sell-off was at hand , with the United States and European economies able to withstand a bout of turmoil. `` 'We see this as a very nasty correction , ' he said , 'not the start of a new bear market .

That said , the global stock market has lost nearly $ 10 trillion in value since June 3 .

Of course , there is still a great deal of the day to go , but what 's clear is that we 're in for a wild ride today .

Led by an 8.5 percent drop in China's Shanghai composite index, U.S. and global stock markets took a dive Monday. Shortly after opening, the Dow Jones index fell by more than 1,000 points, or 5 percent. The Dow then zigzagged to close at 15,871, losing about 3.6 percent of its value.

About an hour into the trading session, the benchmark index had recovered somewhat to a loss of 400 points, or a little more than 2 percent of its value. But the roller coaster continued, with stocks incurring new losses in the afternoon. Both the Nasdaq index and the Standard and Poor's 500 index lost nearly 4 percent.

""The 10 sectors in the S&P 500 headed lower,"" the AP reports, ""with energy stocks recording the biggest decline, 5.2 percent, amid a continued slump in the price of oil. The sector is down almost 25 percent this year.""

CNBC reports how the losses spread from China's swoon:

""Panic spread to European markets, with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 off as much as 3 percent in early London trading. All major bourses were off a similar amount. The index has shed over $1 trillion in market value in August so far. ""Japan's Nikkei 225 index also finished at its lowest closing level since February 23, as a double whammy of China-related fears and a rejuvenated yen brought the bourse down by its biggest one-day drop in more than 2 years.""

Of course, in the U.S., all this comes after a brutal week on Wall Street. On Friday, the Dow closed 531 points lower — in correction territory for the first time since 2011.

We'll update this post often as the markets take in all this news.

Update at 4:05 p.m. ET. Market Staggers To A Close

The Dow Jones index has closed at 15,871.28 — a drop of 588.47, or 3.58 percent, for the day. The benchmark started Monday's session at 16,459.75 and fell more than 1,000 points before recovering some of those losses.

Update at 3:08 p.m. ET. After Rebound, Another Drop

The final hour of a long day is beginning. More than a few traders and investors are no doubt looking forward to happy hour after the stock market closes at 4 p.m. ET.

And it appears they're going to need the barkeep to pour heavy: Prices are dropping fast again. The Dow Jones industrial average is down about 600 points to about 15,860. That's about a 3.6 percent drop.

The fade is disappointing after the midday comeback. The Dow had managed to scratch its way back to only about a 100-point loss, but now it's down, down, down.

The market close should be interesting. Get out your popcorn.

Update at 2 p.m. ET. How Will The Markets Close?

Late summer is a popular time for roller coaster rides, but it's much more fun at an amusement park than on Wall Street.

Up and down, up and down, lots of screaming — that's the stock market this summer. Back in mid-May, the Dow Jones industrial average was up at nearly 18,300. And then wheeeeee, down we went in early June. Back up again in late June, another decline, then a July peak of 18,120.

August brought mostly dips — until suddenly, that stomach-turning, hands-in-the-air screaming plunge began in recent days. As investors settle in for the final two hours of trading on this bleak day, the Dow is down about 350 points, or 2.1 percent, to about 16,100.

Very hard to say right now how the wild ride will end at 4 p.m. We might be laughing and relieved at the finish — or crying and calling for our mommies.

Update at 12:45 p.m. ET. Looking Better:

U.S. stocks, and even some commodities, are starting to look a little better as the trading day continues. When the stock market first opened, the Dow Jones industrial average took a swan dive, falling about 1,000 points within minutes. But as of the midpoint in the day, the average was down only about 130, at about 16,330.

Normally, a hundred-point drop would be seen as bad news, but after the morning's wild plunge, investors took some comfort in seeing the Dow claw its way back.

For commodities, prices are still falling, but at least there were some signs of a small rebound. For example, both corn and wheat ticked up a little, even though prices remain far below where they were in recent years. Lumber seems to be the day's biggest loser with prices down about 10 percent.

Update at 12:06 p.m. ET. Stocks Around The World Are Down:

If misery loves company, then here's some comfort: Stock prices all over the world are down sharply too.

This morning, the U.S. stocks lost nearly 3 percent of their value, but European and Asian stocks did even worse. Their trading hours are over for Monday, and now their investors can lick their wounds and ponder what's next for the week.

The STOXX Europe 600, a measure of European stocks, fell more than 4 percent, while the Shanghai Composite dropped 8.5 percent, marking the biggest one-day drop there since 2007.

Update at 10:15 a.m. ET. A Rebound:

After a frightful opening, stock prices appear to be rebounding, a hopeful sign to many.

Within a few minutes of opening, the Dow Jones industrial average had dropped about 1,000 points. It had never before lost even 800 points in one day. But then again, the DJIA has been higher recently than any time in history, so as a percentage drop, this plunge was no record.

Update at 10:14 a.m. ET. 'A Nasty Correction':

As The New York Times puts it, the big question about all this is whether it portends a long-term slump for the world's economies.

One analyst doesn't think so:

""Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets in Brussels, said there was no sense that an apocalyptic sell-off was at hand, with the United States and European economies able to withstand a bout of turmoil. "" 'We see this as a very nasty correction,' he said, 'not the start of a new bear market.' ""

That said, the global stock market has lost nearly $10 trillion in value since June 3.

Update at 9:36 a.m. ET. A Bloody Opening:

At one point Monday morning, the Dow Jones had been down more than 1,000 points — more than 5 percent.

Of course, there is still a great deal of the day to go, but what's clear is that we're in for a wild ride today.

Update at 8:30 a.m. ET. Two Big Issues:

As Bloomberg sees it, that correction has been caused by two things: The U.S. finally succumbed to the Chinese rout and investors are finally starting to see a Federal Reserve interest hike as a reality.

Bloomberg reports:

""Speculation had been building all year for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in September for the first time since 2006, following the end of quantitative easing in 2014.

Stocks took another steep dive Friday, deepening a multi-day rout fueled by fears about the coronavirus' impact on the global economy.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 357 points on Friday, capping a week in which the blue chip index fell 3,583 points or 12.4%. The Dow is down 16.3% from its recent peak on Feb. 12.

“ With options , you can make money so much faster . So I was then having days where I would make $ 1,000 a day , and then I made $ 10,000 in a day , ” she said . “ And then I started getting really cocky , and I didn ’ t even think I could even lose so much money . Then during the day when it was like we had a really big drop , I lost everything I had made . ”
Chang , 39 , lost her job at a nonprofit in the financial downturn , fell down a “ rabbit hole of stock videos ” on YouTube , and by now has put about $ 25,000 into the trading app Robinhood . The day we spoke , she was basically back where she started . “ I take it in stride , because it ’ s money I had made , but it wasn ’ t really there . ”
She is not an anomaly . In recent months , the stock market has seen a boom in retail trading . Online brokerages have reported a record number of new accounts and a big uptick in trading activity . People are bored at home , sports betting and casinos are largely off the table , and many look at that $ 1,200 stimulus check they got earlier this year as free money . Some are taking cues from mainstream sources like the Wall Street Journal and CNBC , others are looking at Reddit and Barstool Sports ’ Dave Portnoy for ideas ( and entertainment ) . And commission-free trading on gamified apps makes investing easy and appealing , even addicting .
“ It ’ s kind of scary , because I am unemployed right now , I don ’ t want to put too much at risk . But I think I have enough in savings that I ’ m willing to take that risk a little bit , because I also really like gambling , ” Chang said . She ’ s not sure what all of this will mean for her taxes .
I spoke with more than a dozen traders about where they ’ re putting their money , why , and how it ’ s going . Some are doing well , while others have learned some hard lessons already , and they ’ re aware things can get out of control — most of the people I talked to referenced a 20-year-old Robinhood trader who died by suicide in June after believing he ’ d lost hundreds of thousands of dollars on the app . Still , for a lot of them , it ’ s largely a game .
“ It ’ s boring watching stocks , it ’ s not exciting , they ’ re not making these crazy prices , ” said Adam Barker , a 31-year-old software engineer in Massachusetts . “ You don ’ t get a rush throwing money at Berkshire Hathaway and waiting 15 years . ”
Whatever the strategy of this new crop of traders — or lack thereof — they have Wall Street ’ s attention . They remain a small portion of the market , but there is evidence they ’ re making a difference along the margins . They ’ ve ignored predictions from high-profile investors that another crash is on the horizon , and thus far , they ’ ve been right . Many of them relish in their battle against the “ suits ” to prove that anyone can play in stocks .
There ’ s been plenty of finger-wagging in their direction : Billionaire investor Leon Cooperman in June said they ’ re just doing “ stupid things ” and that the momentum will “ end in tears. ” Oaktree Capital co-founder Howard Marks warned it ’ s “ not healthy to have people buying stocks for fun . ”
While there ’ s certainly cause for concern some might be in over their heads , it ’ s also hard to argue that financial opportunity should be cordoned off for institutions and the rich , especially in an economy plagued by inequality where financial mobility , for many , is a myth .
Traditionally , stock-trading has come with a fee , meaning if you wanted to buy or sell , you had to pay for each transaction . But companies like Robinhood have taken a jackhammer to that system by offering commission-free trading . Other major online brokers — Charles Schwab , E-Trade , and TD Ameritrade — have followed suit . Many brokerages are also letting people buy fractional shares , so if you don ’ t have the $ 3,000 to invest in Amazon stock , you can put in $ 300 to buy one-tenth of it .
Trading isn ’ t really free , and big market-makers like Citadel Securities and Virtu Financial pay millions of dollars to process the trades and put them back onto the market , making money off of the spread — the price difference between the buy and the sell . Nathaniel Popper at the New York Times recently outlined how Robinhood makes money off of its customers , and more than other brokerages .
“ It gives the appearance that you ’ re not paying a commission , but it ’ s just hidden , ” said Jim Bianco , president and macro strategist at Bianco Research .
But the perception that it ’ s frictionless and free has helped boost retail trading , and during the pandemic , people have flocked to trading platforms to try their hand at the market . Robinhood , in particular , has become representative of the retail trading boom . The platform , founded by Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt in 2013 and launched in 2015 , says it has about 10 million approved customer accounts , many of whom are new to the market . Its mission is to “ democratize finance for all , ” according to its website . “ We fundamentally believe participation is power , and that the stock market can be an important wealth creation engine , ” a spokesperson for Robinhood said .
Robinhood ’ s version of financial democratization feels deliberately like a game . When you sign up , it offers you a free stock , generally under $ 10 , and encourages you to invite your friends to get more free stocks . The screen turns green when you ’ re up and red when you ’ re down , and when you trade , it sometimes sends you confetti and gives you the money instantly so you can trade again . It ’ s easy to see how people get sucked in fast .
“ Robinhood feels very gamified . The act of trading stocks was boring for a really long time , and even today , if you do it through Charles Schwab , it would seem boring . Robinhood makes it feel frictionless and fun and easy , and it can be very , very addicting , ” said Noah Whinston , who founded an eSports franchise . He does some trading for fun on Robinhood but does most of his investments through a financial adviser . “ I ’ m well aware if I put a lot of money into Robinhood , I might allocate that in ways that are not the smartest but instead based on short-term serotonin hits . ”
Some people are able to resist the temptation , like Nate Brown , 23 . He got his first job out of college working in government tech and decided to try out investing . “ I buy stocks once a month , so probably not as often as you ’ d expect just because I ’ m trying to follow that longer trend , ” he said . “ I saw the options thing on the app , but it honestly kind of scares me . ”
But Brown seems more like the exception in this current cohort of day traders , not the rule . What they ’ re doing isn ’ t really investing , it ’ s gambling .
“ It ’ s the same exact rush you get sitting down at a blackjack table , ” said Luke Lloyd , a wealth adviser at Strategic Wealth Partners . He says he worries about a new generation of traders getting addicted to the excitement . “ It ’ s like putting all of your money on one number at the roulette table . ”
Some traders have become especially enticed by more complex maneuvers and vehicles . A big draw appears to be options trading , which gives traders the right to buy or sell shares of something in a certain period . People can use options to hedge their portfolios , but most of the traders I talked to were using them to make bets as to whether a stock would go up ( a call ) or go down ( a put ) and inject some extra adrenaline into the process .

Reddit and Dave Portnoy , the new kings of the day traders ?
Traditionally , investors have been told to read the Wall Street Journal and comb through corporate filings to make decisions . This new cohort of traders has other ideas — some are swapping the Financial Times for Reddit and Warren Buffett for Dave Portnoy .
On Reddit , many traders are gathering on the subreddit r/WallStreetBets , a coarse , bro-y space that describes itself as “ like 4chan found a Bloomberg Terminal ” and is now 1.3 million members — or , in its terms , “ degenerates ” — strong . ( For comparison , the r/investing subreddit has 1.1 million members . ) The subreddit is , as is par for the course on Reddit , quite ugly and excessive — users refer to themselves as “ autists , ” talk about “ YOLO-ing ” their money away , and post screenshots of their brokerage accounts showing massive losses or gains . But it ’ s also influential : As Luke Kawa wrote for Bloomberg in February , some stocks skyrocketed after being mentioned there , and there ’ s broadly an attitude that traders can try to make stocks move there through the force of sheer collective will .
At the very least , it ’ s a place people are hanging out and looking for ideas . And they sometimes make decisions based on little information beyond seeing a stock ticker float by or seeing a recommendation or news flash from an anonymous person online .
“ Strategy ? I wouldn ’ t use that word to describe it , ” Nick Thoendel , a project manager in commercial doors and hardware in Alabama , told me when I asked him about his strategy for investing the $ 1,000 he ’ s got in Robinhood . “ Just really whatever everyone ’ s talking about . ”
Tom Pariso , 40 , who lives in Los Angeles , has been trading through Robinhood for a couple of years , putting in about $ 15,000 in total , and got more enthralled thanks to the r/WallStreetBets community . “ They ’ re complete strangers , but you feel like they know what they ’ re talking about , ” he said . He had what he described as a “ crazy couple of weeks where everything was clicking ” earlier this year , and in March , he took to the forum to brag about his gains of more than $ 100,000 . “ Then all of a sudden , everything turned in the other direction , ” he told me .
Pariso is now back to more or less where he started , but he can ’ t quit altogether . “ I don ’ t know why . The app is so easy , and the interface , it feels like a game , ” he said of Robinhood . He ’ s also still on the subreddit and feels like the conversation is getting darker there , with more users making coded references to suicide . Much of the time , he says , it ’ s joking , but he has started to report people to Reddit about the potential for self-harm . “ There are people telling stories about how they cashed out of their 401 ( k ) at the start of the pandemic and took their money that they had , got in at the wrong time , and lost everything , ” he said .
While the force of r/WallStreetBets is a collective one , Dave Portnoy , the founder of the blog Barstool Sports , is putting on a one-man show of sorts around the stock market . Portnoy , 43 , started day trading earlier this year . He livestreams himself daily trading as “ Davey Day Trader Global , ” or # DDGT , and claims to be the captain of the stock market . His antics can be pretty ridiculous — in June , he accidentally bopped himself on the head with a hammer anticipating market close — but he ’ s super entertaining . While he ’ s acknowledged major losses , his focus is on gains and the mantra that “ stocks only go up. ” The basic belief is that , eventually , prices will improve .
It ’ s not clear how many people follow Portnoy ’ s investment advice to a T — on July 1 , he tweeted that Sonos should go bankrupt and it ended the day in the green . But he has caused a bit of a ruction on Wall Street . He is part of the conversation among some bigger names in investing and has been outspoken in criticizing certain figures . He declared billionaire investor Warren Buffett “ washed up ” and delivered a lengthy attack on Oaktree Capital and Howard Marks , decrying the firm as a “ corporate raider ” that engaged in “ scumbag practices ” in the wake of the Great Recession .
Tyler Grant , a lawyer in New York , followed Portnoy into Spirit Airlines and made money off the trade , though on other trades , he ’ s bet against him . “ His legacy is going to be the fact that he got people who realized they can get in the game and get in the game really cheaply , ” he said .
I brought the green hammer of death out and concussed myself in the process . If that ’ s what it takes to make # DDTG clients money I ’ ll do it . pic.twitter.com/lEuUmzob5D — Dave Portnoy ( @ stoolpresidente ) June 30 , 2020
Part of Portnoy ’ s shtick is that he claims to have no idea what he ’ s doing so he can ’ t be held responsible for where he invests or whether people follow him . One day in June , he talked about NSPR , the stock ticker for InspireMD , making him money because a woman he went on a date with told him about it and he invested $ 400,000 to impress her . Another day , he picked tiles out of a Scrabble bag to find stocks to invest in . Grant said he doesn ’ t believe it ’ s as random as it seems — after all , he picked Raytheon , a nearly $ 100 billion defense contractor . “ It wasn ’ t like Dave Portnoy went into a bag and pulled out a penny stock , ” he said .
Thoendel , from Alabama , tried to follow Portnoy into airlines for a bit , but it didn ’ t work out . He has a full-time job and can ’ t watch the livestreams anyway , though he still keeps up where he can . “ His whole claiming he ’ s better than Warren Buffett and stuff is hilarious , ” he said . “ He ’ s just a shock jock , basically . ”
While there is likely some overlap between the r/WallStreetBets crowd and Portnoy , it ’ s not clear how much . Portnoy appears to steer clear of options , while on Reddit , they ’ re an important focus . Another curious facet : When you try to post about Barstool Sports and Portnoy on the subreddit , you get an automatic response from a moderator : “ Do not post about barstoolsports or David Portnoy here please . Doing so will mean a ban of arbitrary length . ”
Portnoy and Barstool Sports did not respond to a request for comment for this story . The moderators of r/WallStreetBets ’ initial response was “ ( っ◔◡◔ ) っ ♥ tits or gtfo ♥ . ”
When I pressed about Portnoy , I got a longer answer : “ Well , first : WSB is not a part of any trend — we are the trendsetters , the makers of music , the dreamers of dreams , if you will . Second : Day trading is but a part of what we do here . Mostly it is memes and calling each other lovingly derogatory names . ”
The “ stocks only go up ” meme is correct in the sense that according to conventional wisdom , the stock market , overall , eventually does go up . That ’ s why when the market crashes , experts say not to sell and instead to wait it out . The problem is , when it comes to individual stocks or trading mechanisms that are more complex , it ’ s entirely possible to get wiped out .
That ’ s what happened to Jordan , a consultant in his 40s who asked to remain anonymous to protect his privacy . He had been trading for a while on Robinhood , but in March , the coronavirus lockdowns hit and he started trading more , including leveraged exchange-traded funds , or ETFs . Basically , when the underlying index or fund goes up or down , instead of following it at a one-to-one ratio , leveraged ETFs follow at a two-to-one or three-to-one pace . In Jordan ’ s case , he was focused on oil .
At one point , he was up 400 percent , but now , he ’ s given back those gains . “ To be honest , I had no idea what I was doing , ” he said . “ I have nowhere near the fiscal acuity to understand how those trades work . ”
That ’ s part of the problem with investing in general : It ’ s really hard to get it right , even for professionals .
Spencer Miller , who runs a Robinhood Stock Traders group on Facebook with his brother , rarely uses Robinhood because he knows it can compel you into taking on too much risk . ( He named the Facebook group that because he knew it would get more members . ) But he sees stocks trend in the group — Hertz , Genius Brands , Luckin ’ Coffee — and then fade . He also sees people learning some hard lessons , gaining a bunch of money and then losing it fast . “ Robinhood at times can feel like free money , especially if you get a few winners right off the bat , ” he said . “ You just see the same story over and over and over again . ”
The hope with most of these traders is that they ’ re not making bets they can ’ t afford to lose . But inevitably , when people piled into bankrupt Hertz in June , someone was left holding the bag and paid $ 5.00 for a stock now worth $ 1.50 .
In June , 20-year-old student Alex Kearns from Illinois died by suicide after thinking he ’ d lost $ 730,000 on an options trade on Robinhood . In a note to his family , he said he had “ no clue ” what he was doing . Robinhood subsequently said it would make adjustments to its platform to put in place more guardrails around options trading . It ’ s still scary : As the Financial Times notes , when he died , Kearns actually had a $ 16,000 balance in his account , not a $ 700,000 debt .
Miller recalled a similar mix-up once happening with him , where it appeared he ’ d lost $ 200,000 on the Robinhood app and then adjusted . “ It ’ s the way Robinhood is set up , where everything flows nicely until the moment when it doesn ’ t seem to . ”
And the app itself , like any tech platform , is prone to glitches . Robinhood experienced widespread outages in early March when markets were going wild , locking many traders out of making any changes to their portfolios . Herman Singh , 22 , estimates he lost $ 3,000 during the shutdowns , and the company offered to pay him back $ 75 . “ For small traders , that ’ s a big amount , ” he said . He ’ s still trading , but he ’ s now using other apps .
“ It ’ s not just about investing in the market , but what is your wealth confidence overall ? Do you have money in retirement ? Do you have an emergency fund ? Do you have savings ? Credit card debt ? Student loan debt ? If you have any of the above , conversations about the stock market shouldn ’ t be coming out of your mouth , ” said Lauren Simmons , a former stock trader at the New York Stock Exchange , cautioning about the risk of people getting into the market . “ We are reaching historic highs again , and we are in a global pandemic . ”
The stock market bottomed out in late March and has generally rallied since . Retail investors aren ’ t really the cause — much of the recovery is attributable to the Federal Reserve — but they ’ re making a difference in certain arenas .
“ I don ’ t think we can blame retail traders for jacking up the market , but at an individual stock level , it ’ s a little bit different , ” said Nick Colas , co-founder of the market insight firm Datatrek Research .
Small investors bought up shares of bankrupt companies like Hertz and JC Penney , temporarily driving up their prices , this spring . If you look at Robin Track , which follows the most popular names on the platform , most of them are recognizable and ones where major institutions are heavily invested to the point that traders with a few thousand dollars in their accounts aren ’ t going to do much — Ford , American Airlines , Disney . They are also generally fairly safe . But then there are more surprising and lesser-known ones , such as Aurora Cannabis .
As the Wall Street Journal reported , Options Clearing Corp. has seen a 45 percent jump in daily options contract trading averages this year compared to last , and Goldman Sachs found that options volume from single-contract trades of the 50 top-traded stocks is up from 10 percent to 14 percent . Goldman also estimates that the proportion of shares volume from small trades has gone from 3 percent to 7 percent in recent months .
“ If nothing else , I think everybody agrees that retail trading today is orders of measure bigger than it was a year ago , ” Bianco said .
To be sure , people basically gambling with money they would be devastated to lose is bad . On the other hand , it ’ s not clear that ’ s what ’ s happening en masse . And the traders , well , they ’ ve got a point : It ’ s not like billionaire investors are the good guys here , and why should they be locked out of the opportunities rich people are privy to ?
“ Do you have money in retirement ? Do you have an emergency fund ? Do you have savings ? Credit card debt ? Student loan debt ? If you have any of the above , conversations about the stock market shouldn ’ t be coming out of your mouth . ”
Yes , most speculators and day traders lose money . But the pros don ’ t do infinitely better : Hedge funds and professional stock pickers consistently underperform the S & P 500 . It ’ s easy to chafe at Portnoy ’ s attitude and approach — not to mention issues of toxicity in Barstool ’ s culture — and at r/WSB ’ s tone . But what about private equity firms that buy up companies , fleece them , and then sell them off for parts ? Or hedge funds that scooped up troubled assets during the financial crisis to make billions ? Or the market-makers like Citadel Securities that are ultimately the ones making money off Robinhood ’ s trades ? Or the money Robinhood itself is making pushing customers in a dangerous direction ?
“ I think Portnoy drives Wall Street crazy because he ’ s exposing some of the fallacies that you see on Wall Street , ” said Bianco , who acknowledges he ’ s a “ suit ” in Portnoy ’ s world . “ He ’ s making a mockery out of stock-picking because we all know on Wall Street the vast majority of stock pickers that run portfolios can not beat the indexes . ”
Portnoy is a multimillionaire , and he appears to be using a small portion of his total net worth to trade . He ’ s said once sports betting returns , he ’ ll go back to that , plus there ’ s no denying this is quite a marketing opportunity for him and for Barstool .
And the opportunity to invest in the stock market , even through commission-free platforms , isn ’ t available to everyone . You have to have some money to invest — Colas estimates the average account size is somewhere between $ 2,000 and $ 5,000 — and not everyone does . What ’ s more , it appears the majority of the people investing are men .
Still , the army of retail traders is reading the room . The stock market does , generally , recover , and the March collapse was an opportunity . There ’ s not a really lucrative alternative to stocks for generating returns , and the federal government and Federal Reserve have demonstrated they ’ re more than willing to take extraordinary actions to prop up the market and big industries . The government didn ’ t let the banks fail last time around , so it ’ s hard to believe they ’ ll let the airlines fail now — so why not invest ?
“ Really , we all kind of know they ’ re all going to come back , ” Grant , the New York lawyer , said . “ It would take a huge market collapse for there not to be a Delta . ”
Of course , it ’ s possible the stock market will crash again or that we ’ ll see another correction . There is a fine line between giving people the ability to try to access opportunities to gain wealth and exposing them to predatory practices and unfair risk , like what Robinhood , seemingly pushing people toward options , is doing .
This flurry of retail traders has happened before . Before there was Dave Portnoy , there was Stuart , the fictional Ameritrade trader leading the way on the dot-com boom . Back then , everyone was into internet 1.0 , Colas noted ; now they ’ re just generally optimistic . “ There is no unifying theme this time around , ” he said . “ There isn ’ t a theme that shovels billions of dollars into a raft of dumb ideas that have a common theme . ”
Plus , it ’ s getting a new generation of people into investing , which Wall Street types should be fine with . Maybe they are .
Ultimately , the broader trading trend also says something about the economy . While for many people their new stock market habit is a game , it ’ s also one that ’ s accompanied by real goals — to pay off student loans , to start a business , to have a nest egg set aside for 20 years from now . Some people I spoke with even expressed guilt . Liam Walker , a data protection officer in the UK , said he considered investing in pharmaceutical stocks but decided against it . “ Ethically , it ’ s strange to try to gain some sort of advantage out of the current situation that the world is in , ” he said .
Alfredo Gil , 30 , a New York writer and producer , expressed a similar sentiment of internal conflict with regard to his trading habits . Gil is trying to write a graphic novel and launch his own production company , and he hopes maybe the stock market is the way to save up enough money to do it . He ’ s investing in fairly safe vehicles — ETFs and companies like Disney and Tesla — and , depending on the given week , is up between $ 13,000 and $ 20,000 . He admits that he checks his Robinhood account “ often enough for it to be unhealthy . ”
He worries about contributing to corporate greed and the corrupting powers of wealth , and most of his social circle know he ’ s investing . “ I ’ m attending protests , and I ’ m very vocal with my friends about the current movement and defunding the police . To say , ‘ Oh , I ’ m making a lot of money , ’ it ’ s just not a cool thing to say or bring up . ”
But Gil also sees that this is the system he lives in . Maybe if the United States had Medicare-for-all or universal basic income , he says , he wouldn ’ t be compelled to play the stock market , and things would be different . But they aren ’ t . “ There is a strain of guilt I have regarding making money during this crisis that is increasing our inequality , ” he said , “ but as a gay person of color with no intergenerational wealth , I think there can be things to learn on how to navigate our world . ”

“With options, you can make money so much faster. So I was then having days where I would make $1,000 a day, and then I made $10,000 in a day,” she said. “And then I started getting really cocky, and I didn’t even think I could even lose so much money. Then during the day when it was like we had a really big drop, I lost everything I had made.”

Chang, 39, lost her job at a nonprofit in the financial downturn, fell down a “rabbit hole of stock videos” on YouTube, and by now has put about $25,000 into the trading app Robinhood. The day we spoke, she was basically back where she started. “I take it in stride, because it’s money I had made, but it wasn’t really there.”

She is not an anomaly. In recent months, the stock market has seen a boom in retail trading. Online brokerages have reported a record number of new accounts and a big uptick in trading activity. People are bored at home, sports betting and casinos are largely off the table, and many look at that $1,200 stimulus check they got earlier this year as free money. Some are taking cues from mainstream sources like the Wall Street Journal and CNBC, others are looking at Reddit and Barstool Sports’ Dave Portnoy for ideas (and entertainment). And commission-free trading on gamified apps makes investing easy and appealing, even addicting.

“It’s kind of scary, because I am unemployed right now, I don’t want to put too much at risk. But I think I have enough in savings that I’m willing to take that risk a little bit, because I also really like gambling,” Chang said. She’s not sure what all of this will mean for her taxes.

I spoke with more than a dozen traders about where they’re putting their money, why, and how it’s going. Some are doing well, while others have learned some hard lessons already, and they’re aware things can get out of control — most of the people I talked to referenced a 20-year-old Robinhood trader who died by suicide in June after believing he’d lost hundreds of thousands of dollars on the app. Still, for a lot of them, it’s largely a game.

“It’s boring watching stocks, it’s not exciting, they’re not making these crazy prices,” said Adam Barker, a 31-year-old software engineer in Massachusetts. “You don’t get a rush throwing money at Berkshire Hathaway and waiting 15 years.”

Whatever the strategy of this new crop of traders — or lack thereof — they have Wall Street’s attention. They remain a small portion of the market, but there is evidence they’re making a difference along the margins. They’ve ignored predictions from high-profile investors that another crash is on the horizon, and thus far, they’ve been right. Many of them relish in their battle against the “suits” to prove that anyone can play in stocks.

There’s been plenty of finger-wagging in their direction: Billionaire investor Leon Cooperman in June said they’re just doing “stupid things” and that the momentum will “end in tears.” Oaktree Capital co-founder Howard Marks warned it’s “not healthy to have people buying stocks for fun.”

While there’s certainly cause for concern some might be in over their heads, it’s also hard to argue that financial opportunity should be cordoned off for institutions and the rich, especially in an economy plagued by inequality where financial mobility, for many, is a myth.

The trading game

Traditionally, stock-trading has come with a fee, meaning if you wanted to buy or sell, you had to pay for each transaction. But companies like Robinhood have taken a jackhammer to that system by offering commission-free trading. Other major online brokers — Charles Schwab, E-Trade, and TD Ameritrade — have followed suit. Many brokerages are also letting people buy fractional shares, so if you don’t have the $3,000 to invest in Amazon stock, you can put in $300 to buy one-tenth of it.

Trading isn’t really free, and big market-makers like Citadel Securities and Virtu Financial pay millions of dollars to process the trades and put them back onto the market, making money off of the spread — the price difference between the buy and the sell. Nathaniel Popper at the New York Times recently outlined how Robinhood makes money off of its customers, and more than other brokerages.

“It gives the appearance that you’re not paying a commission, but it’s just hidden,” said Jim Bianco, president and macro strategist at Bianco Research.

But the perception that it’s frictionless and free has helped boost retail trading, and during the pandemic, people have flocked to trading platforms to try their hand at the market. Robinhood, in particular, has become representative of the retail trading boom. The platform, founded by Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt in 2013 and launched in 2015, says it has about 10 million approved customer accounts, many of whom are new to the market. Its mission is to “democratize finance for all,” according to its website. “We fundamentally believe participation is power, and that the stock market can be an important wealth creation engine,” a spokesperson for Robinhood said.

Robinhood’s version of financial democratization feels deliberately like a game. When you sign up, it offers you a free stock, generally under $10, and encourages you to invite your friends to get more free stocks. The screen turns green when you’re up and red when you’re down, and when you trade, it sometimes sends you confetti and gives you the money instantly so you can trade again. It’s easy to see how people get sucked in fast.

“Robinhood feels very gamified. The act of trading stocks was boring for a really long time, and even today, if you do it through Charles Schwab, it would seem boring. Robinhood makes it feel frictionless and fun and easy, and it can be very, very addicting,” said Noah Whinston, who founded an eSports franchise. He does some trading for fun on Robinhood but does most of his investments through a financial adviser. “I’m well aware if I put a lot of money into Robinhood, I might allocate that in ways that are not the smartest but instead based on short-term serotonin hits.”

Some people are able to resist the temptation, like Nate Brown, 23. He got his first job out of college working in government tech and decided to try out investing. “I buy stocks once a month, so probably not as often as you’d expect just because I’m trying to follow that longer trend,” he said. “I saw the options thing on the app, but it honestly kind of scares me.”

But Brown seems more like the exception in this current cohort of day traders, not the rule. What they’re doing isn’t really investing, it’s gambling.

“It’s the same exact rush you get sitting down at a blackjack table,” said Luke Lloyd, a wealth adviser at Strategic Wealth Partners. He says he worries about a new generation of traders getting addicted to the excitement. “It’s like putting all of your money on one number at the roulette table.”

Some traders have become especially enticed by more complex maneuvers and vehicles. A big draw appears to be options trading, which gives traders the right to buy or sell shares of something in a certain period. People can use options to hedge their portfolios, but most of the traders I talked to were using them to make bets as to whether a stock would go up (a call) or go down (a put) and inject some extra adrenaline into the process.

“There’s a lot of risk involved, and you can definitely see why people get into the gambling side of things. It’s definitely the rush,” Barker, the Massachusetts software engineer, said. He kicked about half of his stimulus check into Robinhood and is mainly trading options. “I’m not really in it for the long term.”

The Robinhood spokesperson said the company believes it’s “time to move away from the notion” that it’s gambling or gaming and disputed that the app is gamified, instead saying that what it has is “accessible, modern design.” The spokesperson emphasized that it doesn’t display confetti for every trade and disputed that confetti is a reward, but instead is “celebrating the achievement” of participating in markets. The company also said most of its customers aren’t day traders and that of the customers who trade in any given month, 12 percent make an options trade on average.

Reddit and Dave Portnoy, the new kings of the day traders?

Traditionally, investors have been told to read the Wall Street Journal and comb through corporate filings to make decisions. This new cohort of traders has other ideas — some are swapping the Financial Times for Reddit and Warren Buffett for Dave Portnoy.

On Reddit, many traders are gathering on the subreddit r/WallStreetBets, a coarse, bro-y space that describes itself as “like 4chan found a Bloomberg Terminal” and is now 1.3 million members — or, in its terms, “degenerates” — strong. (For comparison, the r/investing subreddit has 1.1 million members.) The subreddit is, as is par for the course on Reddit, quite ugly and excessive — users refer to themselves as “autists,” talk about “YOLO-ing” their money away, and post screenshots of their brokerage accounts showing massive losses or gains. But it’s also influential: As Luke Kawa wrote for Bloomberg in February, some stocks skyrocketed after being mentioned there, and there’s broadly an attitude that traders can try to make stocks move there through the force of sheer collective will.

At the very least, it’s a place people are hanging out and looking for ideas. And they sometimes make decisions based on little information beyond seeing a stock ticker float by or seeing a recommendation or news flash from an anonymous person online.

“Strategy? I wouldn’t use that word to describe it,” Nick Thoendel, a project manager in commercial doors and hardware in Alabama, told me when I asked him about his strategy for investing the $1,000 he’s got in Robinhood. “Just really whatever everyone’s talking about.”

Tom Pariso, 40, who lives in Los Angeles, has been trading through Robinhood for a couple of years, putting in about $15,000 in total, and got more enthralled thanks to the r/WallStreetBets community. “They’re complete strangers, but you feel like they know what they’re talking about,” he said. He had what he described as a “crazy couple of weeks where everything was clicking” earlier this year, and in March, he took to the forum to brag about his gains of more than $100,000. “Then all of a sudden, everything turned in the other direction,” he told me.

Pariso is now back to more or less where he started, but he can’t quit altogether. “I don’t know why. The app is so easy, and the interface, it feels like a game,” he said of Robinhood. He’s also still on the subreddit and feels like the conversation is getting darker there, with more users making coded references to suicide. Much of the time, he says, it’s joking, but he has started to report people to Reddit about the potential for self-harm. “There are people telling stories about how they cashed out of their 401(k) at the start of the pandemic and took their money that they had, got in at the wrong time, and lost everything,” he said.

While the force of r/WallStreetBets is a collective one, Dave Portnoy, the founder of the blog Barstool Sports, is putting on a one-man show of sorts around the stock market. Portnoy, 43, started day trading earlier this year. He livestreams himself daily trading as “Davey Day Trader Global,” or #DDGT, and claims to be the captain of the stock market. His antics can be pretty ridiculous — in June, he accidentally bopped himself on the head with a hammer anticipating market close — but he’s super entertaining. While he’s acknowledged major losses, his focus is on gains and the mantra that “stocks only go up.” The basic belief is that, eventually, prices will improve.

It’s not clear how many people follow Portnoy’s investment advice to a T — on July 1, he tweeted that Sonos should go bankrupt and it ended the day in the green. But he has caused a bit of a ruction on Wall Street. He is part of the conversation among some bigger names in investing and has been outspoken in criticizing certain figures. He declared billionaire investor Warren Buffett “washed up” and delivered a lengthy attack on Oaktree Capital and Howard Marks, decrying the firm as a “corporate raider” that engaged in “scumbag practices” in the wake of the Great Recession.

Tyler Grant, a lawyer in New York, followed Portnoy into Spirit Airlines and made money off the trade, though on other trades, he’s bet against him. “His legacy is going to be the fact that he got people who realized they can get in the game and get in the game really cheaply,” he said.

Part of Portnoy’s shtick is that he claims to have no idea what he’s doing so he can’t be held responsible for where he invests or whether people follow him. One day in June, he talked about NSPR, the stock ticker for InspireMD, making him money because a woman he went on a date with told him about it and he invested $400,000 to impress her. Another day, he picked tiles out of a Scrabble bag to find stocks to invest in. Grant said he doesn’t believe it’s as random as it seems — after all, he picked Raytheon, a nearly $100 billion defense contractor. “It wasn’t like Dave Portnoy went into a bag and pulled out a penny stock,” he said.

Thoendel, from Alabama, tried to follow Portnoy into airlines for a bit, but it didn’t work out. He has a full-time job and can’t watch the livestreams anyway, though he still keeps up where he can. “His whole claiming he’s better than Warren Buffett and stuff is hilarious,” he said. “He’s just a shock jock, basically.”

While there is likely some overlap between the r/WallStreetBets crowd and Portnoy, it’s not clear how much. Portnoy appears to steer clear of options, while on Reddit, they’re an important focus. Another curious facet: When you try to post about Barstool Sports and Portnoy on the subreddit, you get an automatic response from a moderator: “Do not post about barstoolsports or David Portnoy here please.

Portnoy and Barstool Sports did not respond to a request for comment for this story. The moderators of r/WallStreetBets’ initial response was “(っ◔◡◔)っ ♥ tits or gtfo ♥.”

When I pressed about Portnoy, I got a longer answer: “Well, first: WSB is not a part of any trend — we are the trendsetters, the makers of music, the dreamers of dreams, if you will. Second: Day trading is but a part of what we do here. Mostly it is memes and calling each other lovingly derogatory names.”

Stocks only go up until they don’t

The “stocks only go up” meme is correct in the sense that according to conventional wisdom, the stock market, overall, eventually does go up. That’s why when the market crashes, experts say not to sell and instead to wait it out. The problem is, when it comes to individual stocks or trading mechanisms that are more complex, it’s entirely possible to get wiped out.

That’s what happened to Jordan, a consultant in his 40s who asked to remain anonymous to protect his privacy. He had been trading for a while on Robinhood, but in March, the coronavirus lockdowns hit and he started trading more, including leveraged exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. Basically, when the underlying index or fund goes up or down, instead of following it at a one-to-one ratio, leveraged ETFs follow at a two-to-one or three-to-one pace. In Jordan’s case, he was focused on oil.

At one point, he was up 400 percent, but now, he’s given back those gains. “To be honest, I had no idea what I was doing,” he said. “I have nowhere near the fiscal acuity to understand how those trades work.”

That’s part of the problem with investing in general: It’s really hard to get it right, even for professionals.

Spencer Miller, who runs a Robinhood Stock Traders group on Facebook with his brother, rarely uses Robinhood because he knows it can compel you into taking on too much risk. (He named the Facebook group that because he knew it would get more members.) But he sees stocks trend in the group — Hertz, Genius Brands, Luckin’ Coffee — and then fade. He also sees people learning some hard lessons, gaining a bunch of money and then losing it fast. “Robinhood at times can feel like free money, especially if you get a few winners right off the bat,” he said. “You just see the same story over and over and over again.”

The hope with most of these traders is that they’re not making bets they can’t afford to lose. But inevitably, when people piled into bankrupt Hertz in June, someone was left holding the bag and paid $5.00 for a stock now worth $1.50.

In June, 20-year-old student Alex Kearns from Illinois died by suicide after thinking he’d lost $730,000 on an options trade on Robinhood. In a note to his family, he said he had “no clue” what he was doing. Robinhood subsequently said it would make adjustments to its platform to put in place more guardrails around options trading. It’s still scary: As the Financial Times notes, when he died, Kearns actually had a $16,000 balance in his account, not a $700,000 debt.

Miller recalled a similar mix-up once happening with him, where it appeared he’d lost $200,000 on the Robinhood app and then adjusted. “It’s the way Robinhood is set up, where everything flows nicely until the moment when it doesn’t seem to.”

And the app itself, like any tech platform, is prone to glitches. Robinhood experienced widespread outages in early March when markets were going wild, locking many traders out of making any changes to their portfolios. Herman Singh, 22, estimates he lost $3,000 during the shutdowns, and the company offered to pay him back $75. “For small traders, that’s a big amount,” he said. He’s still trading, but he’s now using other apps.

“It’s not just about investing in the market, but what is your wealth confidence overall? Do you have money in retirement? Do you have an emergency fund? Do you have savings? Credit card debt? Student loan debt? If you have any of the above, conversations about the stock market shouldn’t be coming out of your mouth,” said Lauren Simmons, a former stock trader at the New York Stock Exchange, cautioning about the risk of people getting into the market. “We are reaching historic highs again, and we are in a global pandemic.”

Who has the right to move markets

The stock market bottomed out in late March and has generally rallied since. Retail investors aren’t really the cause — much of the recovery is attributable to the Federal Reserve — but they’re making a difference in certain arenas.

“I don’t think we can blame retail traders for jacking up the market, but at an individual stock level, it’s a little bit different,” said Nick Colas, co-founder of the market insight firm Datatrek Research.

Small investors bought up shares of bankrupt companies like Hertz and JC Penney, temporarily driving up their prices, this spring. If you look at Robin Track, which follows the most popular names on the platform, most of them are recognizable and ones where major institutions are heavily invested to the point that traders with a few thousand dollars in their accounts aren’t going to do much — Ford, American Airlines, Disney. They are also generally fairly safe. But then there are more surprising and lesser-known ones, such as Aurora Cannabis.

As the Wall Street Journal reported, Options Clearing Corp. has seen a 45 percent jump in daily options contract trading averages this year compared to last, and Goldman Sachs found that options volume from single-contract trades of the 50 top-traded stocks is up from 10 percent to 14 percent. Goldman also estimates that the proportion of shares volume from small trades has gone from 3 percent to 7 percent in recent months.

“If nothing else, I think everybody agrees that retail trading today is orders of measure bigger than it was a year ago,” Bianco said.

To be sure, people basically gambling with money they would be devastated to lose is bad. On the other hand, it’s not clear that’s what’s happening en masse. And the traders, well, they’ve got a point: It’s not like billionaire investors are the good guys here, and why should they be locked out of the opportunities rich people are privy to?

“Do you have money in retirement? Do you have an emergency fund? Do you have savings? Credit card debt? Student loan debt? If you have any of the above, conversations about the stock market shouldn’t be coming out of your mouth.”

Yes, most speculators and day traders lose money. But the pros don’t do infinitely better: Hedge funds and professional stock pickers consistently underperform the S&P 500. It’s easy to chafe at Portnoy’s attitude and approach — not to mention issues of toxicity in Barstool’s culture — and at r/WSB’s tone. But what about private equity firms that buy up companies, fleece them, and then sell them off for parts? Or hedge funds that scooped up troubled assets during the financial crisis to make billions? Or the market-makers like Citadel Securities that are ultimately the ones making money off Robinhood’s trades? Or the money Robinhood itself is making pushing customers in a dangerous direction?

“I think Portnoy drives Wall Street crazy because he’s exposing some of the fallacies that you see on Wall Street,” said Bianco, who acknowledges he’s a “suit” in Portnoy’s world. “He’s making a mockery out of stock-picking because we all know on Wall Street the vast majority of stock pickers that run portfolios cannot beat the indexes.”

Portnoy is a multimillionaire, and he appears to be using a small portion of his total net worth to trade. He’s said once sports betting returns, he’ll go back to that, plus there’s no denying this is quite a marketing opportunity for him and for Barstool.

And the opportunity to invest in the stock market, even through commission-free platforms, isn’t available to everyone. You have to have some money to invest — Colas estimates the average account size is somewhere between $2,000 and $5,000 — and not everyone does. What’s more, it appears the majority of the people investing are men.

Still, the army of retail traders is reading the room. The stock market does, generally, recover, and the March collapse was an opportunity. There’s not a really lucrative alternative to stocks for generating returns, and the federal government and Federal Reserve have demonstrated they’re more than willing to take extraordinary actions to prop up the market and big industries. The government didn’t let the banks fail last time around, so it’s hard to believe they’ll let the airlines fail now — so why not invest?

“Really, we all kind of know they’re all going to come back,” Grant, the New York lawyer, said. “It would take a huge market collapse for there not to be a Delta.”

Of course, it’s possible the stock market will crash again or that we’ll see another correction. There is a fine line between giving people the ability to try to access opportunities to gain wealth and exposing them to predatory practices and unfair risk, like what Robinhood, seemingly pushing people toward options, is doing.

This flurry of retail traders has happened before. Before there was Dave Portnoy, there was Stuart, the fictional Ameritrade trader leading the way on the dot-com boom. Back then, everyone was into internet 1.0, Colas noted; now they’re just generally optimistic. “There is no unifying theme this time around,” he said. “There isn’t a theme that shovels billions of dollars into a raft of dumb ideas that have a common theme.”

Plus, it’s getting a new generation of people into investing, which Wall Street types should be fine with. Maybe they are.

Ultimately, the broader trading trend also says something about the economy. While for many people their new stock market habit is a game, it’s also one that’s accompanied by real goals — to pay off student loans, to start a business, to have a nest egg set aside for 20 years from now. Some people I spoke with even expressed guilt. Liam Walker, a data protection officer in the UK, said he considered investing in pharmaceutical stocks but decided against it. “Ethically, it’s strange to try to gain some sort of advantage out of the current situation that the world is in,” he said.

Alfredo Gil, 30, a New York writer and producer, expressed a similar sentiment of internal conflict with regard to his trading habits. Gil is trying to write a graphic novel and launch his own production company, and he hopes maybe the stock market is the way to save up enough money to do it. He’s investing in fairly safe vehicles — ETFs and companies like Disney and Tesla — and, depending on the given week, is up between $13,000 and $20,000. He admits that he checks his Robinhood account “often enough for it to be unhealthy.”

He worries about contributing to corporate greed and the corrupting powers of wealth, and most of his social circle know he’s investing. “I’m attending protests, and I’m very vocal with my friends about the current movement and defunding the police. To say, ‘Oh, I’m making a lot of money,’ it’s just not a cool thing to say or bring up.”

But Gil also sees that this is the system he lives in. Maybe if the United States had Medicare-for-all or universal basic income, he says, he wouldn’t be compelled to play the stock market, and things would be different. But they aren’t. “There is a strain of guilt I have regarding making money during this crisis that is increasing our inequality,” he said, “but as a gay person of color with no intergenerational wealth, I think there can be things to learn on how to navigate our world.”

Here 's why we need real government regulations
September 15 marked five years since the beginning of the economic slump that defines the world we live in . Disaster was in the air already by that day in 2008 : real-estate values had been falling for some time , Bear Stearns and several big commercial banks had failed , and the government had taken over the mortgage insurers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac the previous week . But that Monday morning in September was when the larger economy went over a cliff — after Lehman Brothers , the nation ’ s fourth largest investment bank , finally succumbed to the effects of the noxious securities on which it had gorged itself for years .
Later that day , in a climate of almost complete panic , Merrill Lynch — the nation ’ s third-largest investment bank , which had fed at the same trough — managed to find shelter in the arms of Bank of America . By the next day , the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department announced that they were saving AIG , the mammoth insurance company that had transformed itself into a stealth hedge fund . As for actual hedge funds , more than 700 of them collapsed in the subsequent four months . And Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley , the last two investment-banking leviathans , desperately registered themselves as “ bank holding companies ” and threw themselves upon the mercy of the all-forgiving Fed .
It was the unavoidable explosion after decades of deregulation and willful blindness . A kind of waste product had been deliberately moved through the bowels of a hundred shady mortgage outfits . It was then gilded by delusional ratings agencies and sold to the world by the most respected names in finance . Bribery and deceit and crazy incentives had been the laxatives that pushed this product down the pipe ; money and bonhomie and reassuring economic theory had been the sedatives that put the regulators to sleep .
The industry would supervise itself , we were told — and we believed it . Instead our economic order turned out to be wobbly , even rotten . The great banks looked insolvent . The great capitalists looked like criminals .
Then came a second outrage to rival the first . Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson , who had been effectively promoted to king by a frantic George W. Bush , demanded and received $ 700 billion from Congress to resuscitate the banks run by his former colleagues on Wall Street . There was a class of businesses , we learned , that could not be allowed to fail , no matter what kinds of suicide missions they undertook ; and there was a class of people who could not be held responsible for their deeds , no matter how they beggared the world or deceived their marks . That this class ’ s chosen public persona was one of churlish , sniggering contempt for the non-crooks who were now required to rescue them only compounded the shock .
For the people who were left to cry over cratered investments and pay for the bailouts and endure the downturn , the 2008 collapse may well be the central economic episode of their lives . The consequences for them were sharp and immediate . The Dow Jones Industrial Average began its toboggan ride to 6,550 , while gold bounded up toward $ 1,900 an ounce . Unemployment eventually idled around 10 percent of the working population . Barack Obama became president , Glenn Beck became the media figure of the moment , and the spicy culture-war morsels on which we had chewed for 30 years suddenly seemed bland and tasteless . Meanwhile , the collapse reverberated around the world . The British , the Germans , the Italians and everyone else , it now seemed , had been snacking on American-made toxins .
The events of those days haunt us still . I mean this not only in the sense that unemployment is still high and that Greece is still in ruins , but that a fresh scandal seems to surface every week or so . A few months ago , the website of the Irish Independent posted recordings of telephone calls made by Anglo Irish Bank executives in September 2008 . That ’ s when Anglo Irish , which had spent the preceding decade investing in real estate — if “ invest ” is the word for the kind of insane bets the bank made — crashed in spectacular fashion and approached the Irish government for a bailout .
In the recordings , two executives note that the bank tricked the government by saying it required only €7 billion to regain solvency . Once that was gone , the executives speculated , the government would be forced to shoulder the entire burden of Anglo Irish ’ s worthless loans . Which is precisely what happened , to the tune of some €30 billion , an amount roughly equivalent to 18 percent of Ireland ’ s GDP . In this way , the bank ’ s private folly was transformed into what one Irish journalist later called a “ public noose . . . that has all but choked the life out of this country . ”
And how did the solemn Anglo Irish execs speak of their nation-strangling enterprise on that awful day five years ago ? It should surprise nobody that they laughed like hyenas . Or that one of them told the other that he pulled the €7 billion figure “ out of my arse. ” Or that this same proctological prestidigitator reasoned that if the government “ saw the enormity of it up front , they might decide they have a choice . ”
In the United States , we have had time to reflect , and have come up with a slightly different interpretation of the 2008 disaster : It was government ’ s fault from start to finish . Oh , without a doubt . The financial industry , as New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg assured us a few years ago , might be fun to blame , but it was essentially an innocent bystander . Government ’ s role in ruining the nation was , as the mayor declared , “ plain and simple . ”
Plain and simple it is , for people who choose to understand deeply disturbing reality as a form of moral caricature . For them the catastrophe is a tidy lesson about what happens when government ’ s best intentions go awry — in this case , its supposed desire to put poor people into houses they couldn ’ t afford and didn ’ t in the least deserve .
A few weeks ago , I was reminded of how utterly unremarkable this fictional version of 2008 has become . During an NPR segment about interest rates on college loans , the microphone went to a blogger named Keli Goff , who opined that tuition increases were attributable to the availability of federal loans . Big-government policies were screwing things up , she announced , “ just like we saw in the housing market . The government should not be in the student-loan business. ” This meddling approach was “ distorting the market , ” Goff continued . The other commentator , a former speechwriter for George H. W. Bush , did not disagree .
It ’ s easy enough to understand how an opinion like this has become so widespread . Despite all the investigations and hearings and indignant newspaper stories and editorials that have appeared since Sept. 15 , 2008 , Wall Street still has a vast corps of dedicated and well-compensated defenders . Government has very few .
Its most prominent advocate , President Obama , has always been ambivalent about this part of his job . The one occasion on which he took a forthright stand for the usefulness of government — his famous “ You didn ’ t build that ” speech in 2012 — was followed by an immediate retreat under fire . And while Obama won the White House in large part thanks to the events of September 2008 , he has said relatively little about who caused the crash itself . It is true that he often speaks of the financial industry ’ s “ reckless ” doings during the Bush years . But the idea that society must set rules for the conduct of private business is not a case he is eager to make . His appointees , as well as top Democrats in Congress , have likewise taken pains to mute their denunciations , out of fear of stifling the recovery , or losing out on plutocrat campaign contributions , or both .
Democratic bosses have also steered clear of the kind of populist effort that would have made household phrases out of “ one shitty deal ” and “ IBG YBG ” — and inevitably led to prosecutions . Those bankers were campaign donors , after all . And look , Democrats won the election in 2008 , and passed their feeble regulatory bill in 2010 , and returned Obama to the Oval Office just last year . What ’ s the problem ?
The problem is that we had to blame somebody , and so our fury after September 2008 naturally gravitated back to the familiar pattern of government-hating . To be sure , Americans were already cynical about Washington by the time Lehman Brothers failed . But the `` X-Files '' –style cynicism of the Nineties — and even the `` Rambo '' –style cynicism of the Eighties — look like the happy dreams of youth after the terrible knowledge of 2008 . I ’ m talking about the lesson of the bailouts , which was impossible to dodge : that government was essentially the servant and protector of crooks .
Ignoring public cynicism is the easy way forward . You don ’ t have to vilify or punish anyone , you don ’ t have to investigate or explain anything . But ignoring it will have terrible consequences , and not just because the Democrats have traditionally been the party of government and will suffer all the more if our epidemic federalphobia is not addressed . The bigger problem is this : The economy has to have rules , and government is how we make those rules . If vigilant financial regulation is missing or suppressed or underfunded , disasters like the crash of 2008 are unavoidable .
But a society that believes good government to be an impossibility is unlikely to do what is necessary to keep industry honest . Instead , its regulators will come to see the regulated , rather than the public , as their main clients . They will imagine that industry can police itself . They will party with their private-sector pals and spin happily through the revolving door . And the rest of us will resign ourselves to scandal after scandal , as a new generation of looters rises up to claim positions at the trough when the old looters retire . Indeed — to repurpose an immortal statement by a certain Bush Administration economist — given what we now think we know about the system , it would be irrational for them not to loot .
One of the very few healthy effects of September 2008 was that it momentarily disrupted Washington ’ s consensus of permissible opinion . For years , correctness in the capital had been determined by how deftly a given idea could triangulate between the two parties . The more closely it approached the dead center of the political spectrum , the righter it was . Financial deregulation , as an agreed-upon tenet of both parties , was holy writ , something questioned only by cranks . The social beneficence of Wall Street was equally self-evident .
And then suddenly this modern-day scholasticism , so sensitive to the city ’ s subtle shades of orthodoxy , seemed as futile as phrenology . The Washington world was shaken to its very foundations as the events of September 2008 momentarily revealed that its pet ideas about Wall Street were nothing but an illusion projected by people whose main object was to stuff their pockets . Could it be that the cranks had been right all along , with their apocalyptic moaning about predatory lending and the repeal of Glass–Steagall ?
Not to worry , reader . The walls soon stopped shaking , the planets snapped back into their ageless orbits , and the birds resumed their songs . During the Great Depression , the structure of society and the economy were permanently changed — but this time around , life for the well-situated quickly recovered its delights . Today , the banks are bigger than before , given the wave of emergency mergers and buyouts that followed the crisis . The march of inequality slowed briefly during the disaster , but has since continued its robust progress toward the social arrangements we remember so fondly from the days of the McKinley Administration . As the historian Robert McElvaine recently pointed out to me , a talented hedge-fund manager contrived to make $ 2 billion in 2012 . If you do the math , figuring that he worked eight-hour days and took two weeks of vacation , you will discover that this fine fellow earned more than $ 1 million an hour .
Yes , the center holds — per the title of Jonathan Alter ’ s new book about the Obama Administration and the election of 2012 . And what a triumph that is . The center came close to ruining us with decades of blind economic consensus , but now it has won an election , and in Washington that is all that matters .
There is one way , however , in which the changes brought about by 2008 have been permanent — one way in which the center will probably never hold again . We are a society that watched as those who obeyed the rules got played by Wall Street and Washington . And it has not only hardened us , made us more blasé about corruption ; it has corrupted us . We beheld our powerlessness at the hands of the mighty , and we decided that the thing to do was to make Wall Street even stronger . We accepted our powerlessness and then magnified it . Today we all know that another bubble will soon inflate and burst , but we have chosen to live with that — five years from the last , five years to the next ! Just grab your cash and hang on .

That this class’s chosen public persona was one of churlish, sniggering contempt for the non-crooks who were now required to rescue them only compounded the shock.

For the people who were left to cry over cratered investments and pay for the bailouts and endure the downturn, the 2008 collapse may well be the central economic episode of their lives. The consequences for them were sharp and immediate. The Dow Jones Industrial Average began its toboggan ride to 6,550, while gold bounded up toward $1,900 an ounce. Unemployment eventually idled around 10 percent of the working population. Barack Obama became president, Glenn Beck became the media figure of the moment, and the spicy culture-war morsels on which we had chewed for 30 years suddenly seemed bland and tasteless. Meanwhile, the collapse reverberated around the world. The British, the Germans, the Italians and everyone else, it now seemed, had been snacking on American-made toxins.

The events of those days haunt us still. I mean this not only in the sense that unemployment is still high and that Greece is still in ruins, but that a fresh scandal seems to surface every week or so. A few months ago, the website of the Irish Independent posted recordings of telephone calls made by Anglo Irish Bank executives in September 2008. That’s when Anglo Irish, which had spent the preceding decade investing in real estate — if “invest” is the word for the kind of insane bets the bank made — crashed in spectacular fashion and approached the Irish government for a bailout.

In the recordings, two executives note that the bank tricked the government by saying it required only €7 billion to regain solvency. Once that was gone, the executives speculated, the government would be forced to shoulder the entire burden of Anglo Irish’s worthless loans. Which is precisely what happened, to the tune of some €30 billion, an amount roughly equivalent to 18 percent of Ireland’s GDP. In this way, the bank’s private folly was transformed into what one Irish journalist later called a “public noose . . . that has all but choked the life out of this country.”

And how did the solemn Anglo Irish execs speak of their nation-strangling enterprise on that awful day five years ago? It should surprise nobody that they laughed like hyenas. Or that one of them told the other that he pulled the €7 billion figure “out of my arse.” Or that this same proctological prestidigitator reasoned that if the government “saw the enormity of it up front, they might decide they have a choice.”

In the United States, we have had time to reflect, and have come up with a slightly different interpretation of the 2008 disaster: It was government’s fault from start to finish. Oh, without a doubt. The financial industry, as New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg assured us a few years ago, might be fun to blame, but it was essentially an innocent bystander. Government’s role in ruining the nation was, as the mayor declared, “plain and simple.”

Plain and simple it is, for people who choose to understand deeply disturbing reality as a form of moral caricature. For them the catastrophe is a tidy lesson about what happens when government’s best intentions go awry — in this case, its supposed desire to put poor people into houses they couldn’t afford and didn’t in the least deserve.

A few weeks ago, I was reminded of how utterly unremarkable this fictional version of 2008 has become. During an NPR segment about interest rates on college loans, the microphone went to a blogger named Keli Goff, who opined that tuition increases were attributable to the availability of federal loans. Big-government policies were screwing things up, she announced, “just like we saw in the housing market. The government should not be in the student-loan business.” This meddling approach was “distorting the market,” Goff continued. The other commentator, a former speechwriter for George H. W. Bush, did not disagree.

It’s easy enough to understand how an opinion like this has become so widespread. Despite all the investigations and hearings and indignant newspaper stories and editorials that have appeared since Sept. 15, 2008, Wall Street still has a vast corps of dedicated and well-compensated defenders. Government has very few.

Its most prominent advocate, President Obama, has always been ambivalent about this part of his job. The one occasion on which he took a forthright stand for the usefulness of government — his famous “You didn’t build that” speech in 2012 — was followed by an immediate retreat under fire. And while Obama won the White House in large part thanks to the events of September 2008, he has said relatively little about who caused the crash itself. It is true that he often speaks of the financial industry’s “reckless” doings during the Bush years. But the idea that society must set rules for the conduct of private business is not a case he is eager to make. His appointees, as well as top Democrats in Congress, have likewise taken pains to mute their denunciations, out of fear of stifling the recovery, or losing out on plutocrat campaign contributions, or both.

Democratic bosses have also steered clear of the kind of populist effort that would have made household phrases out of “one shitty deal” and “IBG YBG” — and inevitably led to prosecutions. Those bankers were campaign donors, after all. And look, Democrats won the election in 2008, and passed their feeble regulatory bill in 2010, and returned Obama to the Oval Office just last year. What’s the problem?

The problem is that we had to blame somebody, and so our fury after September 2008 naturally gravitated back to the familiar pattern of government-hating. To be sure, Americans were already cynical about Washington by the time Lehman Brothers failed. But the ""X-Files""–style cynicism of the Nineties — and even the ""Rambo""–style cynicism of the Eighties — look like the happy dreams of youth after the terrible knowledge of 2008. I’m talking about the lesson of the bailouts, which was impossible to dodge: that government was essentially the servant and protector of crooks.

Ignoring public cynicism is the easy way forward. You don’t have to vilify or punish anyone, you don’t have to investigate or explain anything. But ignoring it will have terrible consequences, and not just because the Democrats have traditionally been the party of government and will suffer all the more if our epidemic federalphobia is not addressed. The bigger problem is this: The economy has to have rules, and government is how we make those rules. If vigilant financial regulation is missing or suppressed or underfunded, disasters like the crash of 2008 are unavoidable.

But a society that believes good government to be an impossibility is unlikely to do what is necessary to keep industry honest. Instead, its regulators will come to see the regulated, rather than the public, as their main clients. They will imagine that industry can police itself. They will party with their private-sector pals and spin happily through the revolving door. And the rest of us will resign ourselves to scandal after scandal, as a new generation of looters rises up to claim positions at the trough when the old looters retire. Indeed — to repurpose an immortal statement by a certain Bush Administration economist — given what we now think we know about the system, it would be irrational for them not to loot.

One of the very few healthy effects of September 2008 was that it momentarily disrupted Washington’s consensus of permissible opinion. For years, correctness in the capital had been determined by how deftly a given idea could triangulate between the two parties. The more closely it approached the dead center of the political spectrum, the righter it was. Financial deregulation, as an agreed-upon tenet of both parties, was holy writ, something questioned only by cranks. The social beneficence of Wall Street was equally self-evident.

And then suddenly this modern-day scholasticism, so sensitive to the city’s subtle shades of orthodoxy, seemed as futile as phrenology. The Washington world was shaken to its very foundations as the events of September 2008 momentarily revealed that its pet ideas about Wall Street were nothing but an illusion projected by people whose main object was to stuff their pockets. Could it be that the cranks had been right all along, with their apocalyptic moaning about predatory lending and the repeal of Glass–Steagall?

Not to worry, reader. The walls soon stopped shaking, the planets snapped back into their ageless orbits, and the birds resumed their songs. During the Great Depression, the structure of society and the economy were permanently changed — but this time around, life for the well-situated quickly recovered its delights. Today, the banks are bigger than before, given the wave of emergency mergers and buyouts that followed the crisis. The march of inequality slowed briefly during the disaster, but has since continued its robust progress toward the social arrangements we remember so fondly from the days of the McKinley Administration. As the historian Robert McElvaine recently pointed out to me, a talented hedge-fund manager contrived to make $2 billion in 2012. If you do the math, figuring that he worked eight-hour days and took two weeks of vacation, you will discover that this fine fellow earned more than $1 million an hour.

Yes, the center holds — per the title of Jonathan Alter’s new book about the Obama Administration and the election of 2012. And what a triumph that is. The center came close to ruining us with decades of blind economic consensus, but now it has won an election, and in Washington that is all that matters.

There is one way, however, in which the changes brought about by 2008 have been permanent — one way in which the center will probably never hold again. We are a society that watched as those who obeyed the rules got played by Wall Street and Washington. And it has not only hardened us, made us more blasé about corruption; it has corrupted us. We beheld our powerlessness at the hands of the mighty, and we decided that the thing to do was to make Wall Street even stronger. We accepted our powerlessness and then magnified it. Today we all know that another bubble will soon inflate and burst, but we have chosen to live with that — five years from the last, five years to the next! Just grab your cash and hang on.

FRANKFURT, Germany -- More wild market swings appeared imminent Thursday, with U.S. stocks heading sharply lower after the largest single-day point gain in history for the Dow.

Slowing economic growth globally and a partial U.S. government shutdown heading into its sixth day whipsawed markets from Europe to Asia. Dow futures pointed to a 400-point loss less than two hours before the opening bell, following a 1,000-point gain the previous day.

Trading resumed in European markets which had been closed for the Christmas holiday, and the German DAX slid 1.7 percent to 10,447.53. France's CAC 40 gave up 0.1 percent, to 4,619.74. Britain's FTSE 100 fell a full percentage point to 6,616.55.

Futures for the broad S&P futures slumped 1.5 percent to 2,430.50 and the battered Nasdaq, down more than 18 percent in the past three months, slid 1.6 percent, to 6,188.50.

On Wednesday, U.S. markets snapped a four-day losing streak and clocked their best day in more than 10 years as the Dow jumped 5 percent, or 1,086 points, to 22,878.45. Advisers to President Donald Trump said there were no plans to oust Fed chairman Jerome Powell, though his sentiment on the man he nominated, played out it tweets, seem as volatile as the stock markets. Strong holiday sales, up more than 5 percent during the holiday season in the U.S., also lifted spirits in the shortened trading week. Mastercard SpendingPulse said U.S. shoppers spent more than $850 billion this year.

""The question, of course, is whether this is just a snapback bear market rally, or as Trump said, a tremendous opportunity to buy stocks?"" Chris Weston of Pepperstone Group Limited said. ""We can assess the fundamental drivers, such as poor global economics, the Fed not altering its forward guidance or providing flexibility to the pace of balance sheet normalization, and ascertain nothing has really changed here,"" he added.

The nation ’ s unemployment rate stands at a 7 percent , down from its post-recession peak but still an uncomfortably high level affecting millions of US workers .

Yellen was confirmed with a 56-to-26 Senate vote early Monday evening , with the substantial number of “ no ” votes , symbolizing how the Fed ’ s role has come in for greater scrutiny and criticism in recent years .
Where many economists say the Fed ’ s efforts did much to steer the economy out of recession , the US central bank is not particularly popular with the American public .

Yellen ’ s job will also be , in part , to try to build the Fed ’ s brand as an institution serving all Americans , not just power brokers on Wall Street or in Washington .
When senators held a hearing on the Yellen nomination back in November , she left little doubt that she sees her first mission as continuing to promote healthy growth .
“ Unemployment is … still too high , reflecting a labor market and economy performing far short of their potential , ” she said in her prepared testimony . “ I believe that supporting the recovery today is the surest path to returning to a more normal approach to monetary policy . ”
That more normal approach by the Fed would include higher short-term interest rates ( perhaps starting some time in 2015 ) , gradually winding down a campaign of monthly bond purchases ( something the Fed just began to do at its December policy meeting ) , and ultimately shrinking the Fed ’ s bond portfolio .

Ilhan Omar claimed on Twitter Sunday that 40 percent of people in the United States have less than $ 400 in their bank accounts .
The claim also made recent appearances in comments by Sen. Bernie Sanders , an article published by Salon , and a National Interest article , among other media exploring the economic impact of coronavirus .
The 40 percent number seems to be pulled from the Federal Reserve ’ s Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S . Households in 2018 , which found that 61 percent of Americans said they would be able to cover a hypothetical expense of $ 400 using cash they had on hand , savings , or a credit card which would then be paid off on their next statement . In that same report , 27 percent of respondents said they would cover the expense some other way , such as carrying a balance on their credit card or borrowing from friends and family , and 12 percent said they would be unable to cover the expense at all .
The report notes , however , that “ [ a ] lthough so many incurring additional costs for a modest expense is disconcerting , it is possible that some would choose to borrow even if they had $ 400 available , preserving their cash as a buffer for other expenses. ” In other words , the study was a self-reported record of how people would respond to an unforeseen additional $ 400 expense . It did not directly address whether respondents had $ 400 in their bank account .
In fact , the report cites a study based on the 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances by Neil Bhutta and Lisa Dettling , which found that even with monthly expenses included , “ 76 percent of families have at least $ 400 in liquid savings. ” This directly contradicts Omar ’ s claim .
Even if this statistic were true , however , it still wouldn ’ t serve as a good indicator of how well most Americans will be able to withstand the economic distress brought on by the current reality . The study that Omar cited used $ 400 to represent “ small , unexpected expenses ” individuals might face , but that number is likely far lower than the financial shortfall faced by many Americans during a prolonged economic shutdown without a clear end date .
To address this question , the Bhutta and Dettling study offered a far better—and more dire—indicator , noting that “ only about 40 percent of families have liquid savings equivalent to at least three months of expenses , and less than 30 percent have liquid savings equivalent to at least six months of expenses . ”
There is no evidence to support Rep. Omar ’ s claim that 40 percent of Americans don ’ t have $ 400 in their bank accounts , but her general assumption that most American families do not have the funds to subsist for an extended period of time during an emergency is almost certainly correct .","Minnesota Democratic Rep.

Cordray ’ s resignation last week prompted a crisis at the CFPB , which in short order evolved into a proxy conflict over the power of the administrative state , the sprawling network of agencies that enforce federal laws and promulgate their own regulations .
The law which charted the CFPB — the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act — contains a succession provision allowing the agency ’ s deputy director to assume the directorship if the post is vacant . Cordray designated Deputy Director Leandra English as his interim successor before resigning , citing that provision of federal law . The Trump administration countered that the president has power to name an acting director under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act ( FVRA ) , and tapped Mulvaney to lead the agency until a permanent director is confirmed .
Mulvaney ’ s appointment prompted a lawsuit from English , who claims she is the rightful acting director . The suit was filed at the U.S. District Court in Washington , D.C. She is represented by Deepak Gupta , a litigator associated with several anti-Trump legal causes .
“ The talented and hard-working CFPB staff stand up for consumers every day , ” English said in a statement . “ As acting director , I am filing this lawsuit to stand up for the CFPB . ”
English ’ s lawsuit argues the plain text of the Dodd-Frank Act dictates that she is the lawful acting director . The law provides that the deputy director shall “ serve as acting director in the absence or unavailability of the director . ”
While an original draft of Dodd-Frank contained language providing for an acting director ’ s appointment under the FVRA , the final version of the legislation designates the deputy director as the interim leader . This indicates , she argues , that Congress deliberately applied the Dodd-Frank language in order to supersede the FVRA .
The Office of Legal Counsel , a division of the Department of Justice which advises the president and other executive branch officers on the scope of executive power , produced an opinion siding with Trump in the dispute . The opinion explains that Dodd-Frank does not displace the president ’ s authority under the FVRA , because Congress has never said that the FVRA is supplanted when an agency has its own statutory succession procedure . An FVRA appointment , they say , is always one of several options available to the president , unless a law expressly forbids the executive from temporarily filling a post under the Vacancies Act .
Other legal scholars have argued there is a meaningful distinction between “ absence or unavailability ” and “ vacant , ” suggesting the Dodd-Frank provision may not apply when the director resigns or is fired . In a separate 1978 opinion concerning the distinction between “ absence ” and “ vacancy , ” OLC explained : “ [ t ] he term ‘ absence ’ normally connotes a failure to be present that is temporary , in contradistinction to the the term ‘ vacancy ’ caused , for example , by death of the incumbent or his resignation. ” The OLC opinion respecting Mulvaney ’ s appointment , however , argues a resignation is captured by the term “ unavailability . ”
The agency ’ s general counsel , Mary McLeod , issued a memo to CFPB leadership advising that officials should proceed on the assumption that Mulvaney is the rightful head of the agency .
“ As general counsel for the bureau , it is my legal opinion that the president possesses the authority to designate an acting director for the bureau , ” McLeod wrote in a Nov. 25 memo obtained by Politico . “ I advise all bureau personnel to act consistently with the understanding that Director Mulvaney is the acting director of the CFPB . ”

A few hours later , President Donald Trump named someone else to lead the agency : Mick Mulvaney , the White House budget director and one of the CFPB ’ s fiercest critics .

But administration officials say the 1998 Federal Vacancies Reform Act gives the president the power to temporarily fill agency positions , except for those with multi-member boards - an exemption they said did not apply to the CFPB .
On Saturday evening , the Justice Department said in a memo that the White House was right to name a new CFPB director .
The Dodd-Frank language about changing CFPB directors is “ unusual ” but the White House may name an interim chief , according to the memo .
Such advice from the Justice Department is open to legal challenge .
Alan Kaplinsky , head of the Consumer Financial Services Group for law firm Ballard Spahr LLP , said the issue will likely have to be decided in the courts . In the meantime , he said , “ This enormous cloud of uncertainty ” will hang over the CFPB .
Kaplinsky said he believes that Dodd-Frank provides for the deputy director to take charge during the short-term , but Congress did not explicitly list the resignation of the director as a situation where the deputy would step up .
“ I think Trump wins , but unfortunately it is going to take a while , ” Kaplinsky said .
Quyen Truong , a partner at law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan who was the assistant director and deputy general counsel for the CFPB until early 2016 , said the industry should expect CFPB staff to continue their work , but that the “ agency ’ s actions during this period almost certainly will be subject to legal challenge . ”

Despite the legal uncertainty , Mulvaney is expected to “ show up Monday and he will go into the office and start working , ” a senior administration official said on Saturday . White House officials said English was also expected to turn up on Monday and serve as Mulvaney ’ s deputy .
Cordray is the only person to have led the young agency , making this the first time that succession of the director has been tested .
Administration officials said the appointment of Mulvaney was “ routine ” and that the White House had sought guidance from the Justice Department before Friday ’ s announcement .
“ This needs to be decided in the courts , ” Warren said in a tweet on Saturday .
Industry critics said the succession battle underlined that the agency lacks proper Congressional oversight .
“ The CFPB ’ s current governing structure is a dictatorship , period , ” Richard Hunt , head of the Consumer Bankers Association , a trade group for retail banking , said in a statement .
Democrats and consumer advocates said it was unfair and inappropriate to put Mulvaney - who once described the CFPB as a “ joke ” - in charge .

The Dodd-Frank language about changing CFPB directors is “unusual” but the White House may name an interim chief, according to the memo.

Such advice from the Justice Department is open to legal challenge.

Alan Kaplinsky, head of the Consumer Financial Services Group for law firm Ballard Spahr LLP, said the issue will likely have to be decided in the courts. In the meantime, he said, “This enormous cloud of uncertainty” will hang over the CFPB.

Kaplinsky said he believes that Dodd-Frank provides for the deputy director to take charge during the short-term, but Congress did not explicitly list the resignation of the director as a situation where the deputy would step up.

“I think Trump wins, but unfortunately it is going to take a while,” Kaplinsky said.

Quyen Truong, a partner at law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan who was the assistant director and deputy general counsel for the CFPB until early 2016, said the industry should expect CFPB staff to continue their work, but that the “agency’s actions during this period almost certainly will be subject to legal challenge.”

Despite the legal uncertainty, Mulvaney is expected to “show up Monday and he will go into the office and start working,” a senior administration official said on Saturday. White House officials said English was also expected to turn up on Monday and serve as Mulvaney’s deputy.

English could not be reached for comment.

FIRST SUCCESSION

Cordray is the only person to have led the young agency, making this the first time that succession of the director has been tested.

Administration officials said the appointment of Mulvaney was “routine” and that the White House had sought guidance from the Justice Department before Friday’s announcement.

“This needs to be decided in the courts,” Warren said in a tweet on Saturday.

Industry critics said the succession battle underlined that the agency lacks proper Congressional oversight.

“The CFPB’s current governing structure is a dictatorship, period,” Richard Hunt, head of the Consumer Bankers Association, a trade group for retail banking, said in a statement.

Democrats and consumer advocates said it was unfair and inappropriate to put Mulvaney - who once described the CFPB as a “joke” - in charge.

Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives’ Financial Services Committee, said Mulvaney would have too much power, as the CFPB director also sits on the boards of two other financial regulatory agencies.

“The White House would have an alarming degree of direct control over financial regulation, supervision, and enforcement,” Waters said in a statement.",www.reuters.com,center,RcRd3R9e3twNjLdg

banking_and_finance,CBS News,0,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/women-denied-abortions-in-financial-distress-years-later-study-finds/,"Women denied abortions live in financial distress years later, study finds",,Kate Gibson,"The financial cards are stacked against women who want but are denied an abortion , as they and their children are more likely to spend years living in poverty than those able to end their pregnancies , a new study suggests . Those compelled to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term are far more likely to experience eviction , bankruptcy and be mired in debt , according to the findings released Monday by the National Bureau of Economic Research .
In looking at a decade of credit data for women who sought abortions at 30 health providers in 21 states , the latest findings build upon a study released last year that found denied abortions quadrupled the odds of a new mother and her child living in poverty . The new analysis compared changes over time in credit report outcomes for three years before and up to five years after the intended abortion .
`` We find that being denied an abortion has large and persistent effects on financial distress that are sustained for five years following the intended abortion , '' wrote the report 's authors , Sarah Miller of the University of Michigan , Laura Wheery of the University of California at Los Angeles and Diana Foster of of the University of California at San Francisco . `` Unpaid debts that are more than 30 days past due more than double in size , and the number of public records , which include negative events such as evictions and bankruptcies , increases substantially . ''
An inability to afford raising a child was the biggest reason given by women seeking abortions , and for those denied the procedure , public-assistance programs largely failed to compensate for the costs of having a baby and keeping the family out of poverty , the researchers noted .
Together , the studies found that carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term increased by 78 % the amount of debt 30 days or more past due and increased negative public records like evictions and bankruptcies by 81 % . Women refused abortions were nearly four times as likely to live below the federal poverty line four years later as those who had abortions , according to the research , and three-quarters reported not being able to cover basic expenses , such as housing , transportation and food , five years later . Almost two-third , or 63 % , already had one child .
The economic picture illustrated in the research is particularly pertinent in that the decision to end a pregnancy is increasingly being challenged in the U.S. , with at least nine states passing abortion bans in the last year , according to the Center for Reproductive Rights .

A federal appeals court in December upheld a lower court 's decision striking down Mississippi 's ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy . The judge cited Supreme Court decisions dating back nearly five decades to the Roe v.

The Supreme Court in March is hearing its first challenge to Roe v. Wade , the landmark ruling in January 1973 that legalized abortion in the U.S. , since Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined the high court in October 2018 .
`` Given that the current trend has been for state laws to lower gestational limits , with recent efforts to ban abortions as early as six weeks or even through the entire pregnancy , it seems likely that the number of women being denied a wanted abortion in the U.S. will only continue to grow over time , '' the study 's authors concluded .","The financial cards are stacked against women who want but are denied an abortion, as they and their children are more likely to spend years living in poverty than those able to end their pregnancies, a new study suggests. Those compelled to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term are far more likely to experience eviction, bankruptcy and be mired in debt, according to the findings released Monday by the National Bureau of Economic Research.

In looking at a decade of credit data for women who sought abortions at 30 health providers in 21 states, the latest findings build upon a study released last year that found denied abortions quadrupled the odds of a new mother and her child living in poverty. The new analysis compared changes over time in credit report outcomes for three years before and up to five years after the intended abortion.

""We find that being denied an abortion has large and persistent effects on financial distress that are sustained for five years following the intended abortion,"" wrote the report's authors, Sarah Miller of the University of Michigan, Laura Wheery of the University of California at Los Angeles and Diana Foster of of the University of California at San Francisco. ""Unpaid debts that are more than 30 days past due more than double in size, and the number of public records, which include negative events such as evictions and bankruptcies, increases substantially.""

An inability to afford raising a child was the biggest reason given by women seeking abortions, and for those denied the procedure, public-assistance programs largely failed to compensate for the costs of having a baby and keeping the family out of poverty, the researchers noted.

Together, the studies found that carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term increased by 78% the amount of debt 30 days or more past due and increased negative public records like evictions and bankruptcies by 81%. Women refused abortions were nearly four times as likely to live below the federal poverty line four years later as those who had abortions, according to the research, and three-quarters reported not being able to cover basic expenses, such as housing, transportation and food, five years later. Almost two-third, or 63%, already had one child.

Supreme Court to hear pivotal abortion case in March

The economic picture illustrated in the research is particularly pertinent in that the decision to end a pregnancy is increasingly being challenged in the U.S., with at least nine states passing abortion bans in the last year, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights. Should the U.S. Supreme Court limit or overturn Roe v. Wade, abortion rights would be protected in less than half of U.S. states and in none of its territories, the center noted.

A federal appeals court in December upheld a lower court's decision striking down Mississippi's ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy.

(CNN) In 1999 when I graduated from college, my classmates and I couldn't wait to get out into the world. During the heady days of the dot.com boom, the world beyond the comfortable ivory tower seemed to be full of opportunities. But things started to look different when the boom turned to bust. Start-ups disappeared. Large firms stopped hiring. Our confidence evaporated.

Today, I fear that my students who are walking out the door with their degrees in hand are entering a darker world. Earlier in the spring, the economy seemed to be picking up. Prosperity was returning and job prospects looked good. But after a tumultuous summer, all that has changed. Large declines in stock markets around the world created an economic gloom some are beginning to compare to the crash of 2008.

This week, turmoil in the global stock market continued with sell-offs in Asia, Europe and the United States. While it's hard to say the rollercoaster market is temporary, or sign of a bigger trend, there's no doubt it impacts everyone, from government heads to common investors to retirees.

Usually, when facing darkening economic circumstances, I suggest to my students to take the long view. Just as certain as markets go down, they will go back up again. The problem is this is only half the story. Investors might find their portfolios improve over time. But this isn't true for graduates hitting the labor market.

A variety of stressors , including job loss , poor health , self-isolation and quarantine , and general anxiety and uncertainty , could negatively impact mental health . Some people may also be struggling with existing conditions such as substance-use disorders or depression .

Normalize any intense uncomfortable emotions you ’ re having right now , said Joan Cook , a clinical psychologist and Yale School of Medicine associate professor who studies traumatic stress .

This is an unprecedented time for all of us , she said , and “ there are a lot of unknowns . ”

“ Mental health is not only critically important to pay attention to during COVID-19 for its own sake , ” Moutier added , “ but because the brain is connected to the body , how well we ’ re managing our mental health will directly affect our physical health — for example , things even like the strength of our immune system . ”

But “people are resilient,” said Vaile Wright, a clinical psychologist and researcher at the American Psychological Association. “We can adapt,” she said. “We can get through this.”

Here are some strategies for coping:

Be kind to yourself

Normalize any intense uncomfortable emotions you’re having right now, said Joan Cook, a clinical psychologist and Yale School of Medicine associate professor who studies traumatic stress. Don’t judge yourself if you feel mild anxiety or depression, loneliness, boredom, frustration or anger. This is an unprecedented time for all of us, she said, and “there are a lot of unknowns.”

“While it’s important to ground ourselves by remembering to ‘count our blessings’ and be grateful for our lives and any privileges we have, it is equally important for us to acknowledge that social distancing, quarantine or isolation is hard,” Cook said. “And know that you are not alone in finding the consequences of social distancing, like losing our jobs or being physically distanced from family and friends, also very difficult.”

Give yourself credit if you are following the social-distancing directives of federal, state and local health officials, Cook added. “It’s important that we give ourselves the recognition when we do a good job,” she said. “You’re reducing the possibility of transmitting the virus, and protecting those who are most vulnerable.”

Address your physical health

You may be out of a job or working from home, but you still need to mind your basic human needs. Establish a routine, Wright said: Get enough sleep, get dressed in the morning, take a shower and eat a healthy diet. Exercise, she added, even if it’s just by going outside for fresh air. Build structure into an otherwise loose day by scheduling all of these needs, Moutier said.

“Mental health is not only critically important to pay attention to during COVID-19 for its own sake,” Moutier added, “but because the brain is connected to the body, how well we’re managing our mental health will directly affect our physical health — for example, things even like the strength of our immune system.”

Connect with friends, family and/or online communities

Stay in connected with friends and family through phone calls, text messages, FaceTime AAPL, -1.43% video calls and social media. “We all need to put in extra effort right now,” Wright said. If you are struggling with tough emotions, reach out to the most trustworthy person in your life to share how you’re feeling, Moutier said; that simple act could be a game changer.

Laughter and play are “critically necessary” during this time, Moutier added. Moments of humor might be harder to come by right now, but try to prioritize them.

If you lack an existing social-support system, “now is the time to go out and find connection with others, even if you don’t know who they are,” Wright said. Seek out online support groups or social-media communities related to your interests. After all, social distancing is actually physical distancing, Moutier said. “Socially, we can remain even closer.”

Consume news wisely

Stay informed about the pandemic, especially at your local level, but try to get off your devices too, Wright said. “Find the bit of the news that either empowers you or doesn’t drive up your anxiety,” she said. Wright, for example, has found that TV pundits and Twitter TWTR, +0.30% tend to make her more anxious. “Absolutely do not read the news or check stuff before going to sleep,” she added.

Take advantage of telehealth services

The federal government has expanded access to telemedicine in response to COVID-19, as have some states. “If you are in therapy or mental-health treatment, make sure that you continue it and ask your provider specifically if they’re providing video chat or telehealth,” Moutier said.

If you believe your mental health is deteriorating, seek help. “There’s evidence that shows that telehealth can be as effective as in-person treatment in many instances,” she said. The present situation “could be a tipping point for not just acceptance for telehealth, but also removing the barriers to it around reimbursement and access,” Wright said.

Try a mental-health app

Look for an app that has scientific backing, as well as mental or behavioral-health experts who served as subject-matter experts, Wright said. Understand the app’s privacy policy and where your data might go, and look through the reviews. Experts praise the Department of Veteran Affairs’ line of health apps, which includes apps for PTSD coping and mood boosting.

Ground yourself

Is your anxious mind racing at 100 miles per hour? Theresa Nguyen, the chief program officer for the nonprofit Mental Health America, suggested the mental-heath technique of grounding. “Grounding is a technique to use your five senses and just bring your attention to the present moment,” she said. “It’s very effective, because your mind can only think about one thing at a time.”

If you’re gardening, for example, put your hand in the soil and just focus on that. Touch whatever is around you or try reciting a mantra to yourself, and remember to breathe deeply. We sometimes hold our breath when we are anxious or working hard, which can also exacerbate our anxiety, mental-health professionals say.

Engage in activities you know will help you feel healthy and centered, Moutier said, whether it’s exercise like yoga, walking or running, or hobbies like reading, crafting or music. Relax yourself with deep breathing exercises. “Not everyone is a nature person, but there is a fairly common experience that being in nature is grounding in and of itself,” she added.

Tap into crisis hotlines

What's in the way? Politics.",2020-03-06,,"Most Democratic and Republican voters agree on a wide range of proposals to boost the economy , from upgrading infrastructure to reducing college costs , casting doubt on the conventional belief that pocketbook issues are hopelessly dividing voters in the 2020 election .
A Public Agenda/███/Ipsos survey reveals that Americans agree far more than they disagree on ways to make it easier for low- and middle-income people to get good jobs and for corporations to provide them . The poll of Democrats , Republicans and independents is part of the three organizations ’ `` Hidden Common Ground 2020 Initiative , '' which seeks to explore areas of agreement on major issues .
Most Americans , regardless of party affiliation , support proposals to upgrade infrastructure ; provide tax breaks to job-creating businesses ; decrease college costs ; and retrain adults for better-paying positions . The survey of about 1,000 adults was conducted February 20-21 .
Climate change agreement : Republican and Democratic voters actually agree on many climate change fixes . So why no action ?
Tight Squeeze : Bigger and bigger SUVs , pickups are outgrowing home garages , public parking spaces
“ There is near unanimity in support for multiple policies promoting job creation , ranging from training and education programs to investing in infrastructure and research , ” says Ipsos Vice President Chris Jackson .
Voters express partisan differences on issues like raising the minimum wage , promoting labor unions and easing regulations on businesses . But even those gaps aren ’ t as stark as political rhetoric would suggest .
Democrats and Republicans also disagree over whether government should bear the burden of job creation . Sixty percent of Democrats say the government is responsible for making sure there are enough good jobs , compared with 35 % of Republicans .
And not surprisingly , Democrats and Republicans have contrasting outlooks on the economy under President Trump . Seventy-one percent of Republicans say the economy is excellent or good – notwithstanding the recent concerns and market panic sparked by the coronavirus – compared with 30 % of Democrats and 43 % of independents .
And 62 % of Republicans describe their family ’ s financial situation positively , vs. 52 % of Democrats .
But most survey respondents agree that state and federal governments can take steps to improve the economy and create good jobs by :
► Upgrading public infrastructure , such as roads and bridges , to create good jobs and make the economy more productive : 83 % of Republicans , 85 % of Democrats and 74 % of independents .
► Decreasing the cost of colleges and universities so more Americans can get an education and a good job : 72 % of Republicans , 85 % of Democrats and 74 % of independents .
► Creating incentives that encourage businesses to bring good jobs they moved overseas back to the U.S. : 86 % of Republicans , 82 % of Democrats and 83 % of independents .
► Providing tax breaks to businesses that create good quality jobs in communities that need them : 81 % of Republicans , 69 % of Democrats and 56 % of independents .
Some of these ideas long have drawn bipartisan support , such as repairing the nation ’ s crumbling infrastructure . But the idea is bogged down in political battles over how to pay for it .
The fault lines between voters are more pronounced in other areas . Eighty percent of Democrats support raising the minimum wage so every full-time job provides enough income to keep people above the poverty line . The federal pay floor has been stuck at $ 7.25 an hour since 2009 .
Only 48 % of Republicans and 54 % of independents back a minimum wage increase , compared with 80 % of Democrats . Yet it may be surprising that roughly half of Republicans and independents favor the proposal , suggesting there could be space for negotiation on how much to increase base pay . For years , the Republican-majority Senate has refused to consider any minimum wage hike , including a bill passed by the Democratic-dominated House last year to more than double the threshold to $ 15 an hour .

If half of Republican voters back the idea , “ There ’ s got to be room for some kind of compromise , ” says David Schleifer , director of research for Public Agenda , the nonpartisan , nonprofit research and public engagement organization that spearheaded the survey .
Similarly , 46 % of Republicans and 52 % of independents support making it easier for workers to join unions to negotiate for better wages and working conditions , compared with 76 % of Democrats . Those results underscore that while unions may not garner bipartisan support , policymakers could take other steps to help workers to bargain with employers , says Catherine Ruckelshaus , general counsel of the National Employment Law Project , a worker advocacy group .
“ I don ’ t think the problem is with the public , ” Schleifer says of longstanding stalemates in Washington . “ It ’ s really elected officials not being willing or able to move things forward , ” perhaps because they ’ ve been swayed by lobbyists or industry campaign contributions .
Charles Hyland , 32 , of Brunswick , Maryland , is an independent who usually votes Democratic and says he ’ s “ fairly liberal. ” He describes the national economy and his financial situation as “ fair. ” After graduating from college in 2008 , during the depths of the Great Recession , he struggled to launch his photography business and moonlighted as a substitute teacher to make ends meet .
He ultimately shut down the firm and now works as a firefighter . His wife , Sophia is a veterinary technician . “ We ’ re making do , ” he says .
Like most other survey respondents , Hyland supports proposals such as upgrading infrastructure , funding research , creating retraining programs and encouraging businesses to bring jobs back from overseas .
He also fervently backs raising the nation ’ s minimum wage to $ 15 an hour . “ I earn $ 21 , $ 22 an hour and I live paycheck to paycheck , ” he says . “ People can ’ t live on ( the current $ 7.25 federal minimum ) – period . ”
The union member also believes in making it easier for workers to join unions . Nationally , the share of private-sector workers who belong to unions has fallen to 10.3 % from 35 % in 1954 .
But Hyland ’ s views on other proposals aren ’ t rigid . He favors reducing college costs . “ I believe it ’ s in the interest of the country to make it more affordable , ” he says . But , he adds , “ I don ’ t believe necessarily in free college , ” adding there ’ s too much focus on four-year schools . “ My bachelor ’ s degree became useless . ”
Much of the government ’ s funding , he says , should go to community colleges and trade schools .

Hyland ’ s views on other proposals are less traditionally Democratic . He supports giving tax breaks to companies “ if they keep the money in the local economy . ”
And while he generally opposes cutting regulations on businesses , especially environmental ones , he ’ s not dogmatic . “ Which regulations are we talking about ? ” he asks .
Penny Mahar , 79 , of New Hartford , New York , appears to be Hyland ’ s political opposite in some respects . She ’ s a Republican who describes the national economy as “ excellent ” and her personal financial situation as “ good . ”
Four years ago , Mahar , a widow , moved from the three-bedroom house she shared with her husband to a mobile home to save money and channel the profits into an annuity . She mostly lives off Social Security payments and a small pension from the insurance company where she worked for 24 years .
Unlike Hyland , Mahar doesn ’ t believe it ’ s the government ’ s responsibility to create good jobs . And she doesn ’ t want to encourage union membership . “ They ’ ve become too powerful and they ’ ve become corrupt , ” she says .
But she sounds a lot like Hyland on other issues . She opposes making public colleges free for all students .
“ If ( students ) had to pay , they would take more of an interest , ” Mahar says . “ I see people going along for the ride . ”
She agrees , however , that the government should reduce the costs “ so young people have the opportunity to go to college . ''
Mahar also believes in giving tax breaks to businesses that create jobs , saying they ’ ll likely invest the savings in their employees .
And while she favors paring back regulations for businesses , she adds , “ You can ’ t just say all of it ’ s got to go . What ’ s working , let it work . It ’ s not working , find out why it ’ s not working . ”
Mahar supports raising the federal minimum wage from $ 7.25 an hour . “ Everything else has gone up , ” she says of consumer prices . But she differs from Hyland on how much it should be lifted . “ I wouldn ’ t go as dramatic as $ 15 . That seems like a large increase ” that could hurt businesses .
If voters like Mahar and Hyland share common ground , why can ’ t lawmakers ?
Jan Rivkin , a Harvard Business School professor , says the problem runs deeper than campaign contributions . “ The rewards go not to those that solve problems but to those that rile up their base , ” Rivkin says . “ Somewhere along the way , compromise became a dirty word . ”
Members of Congress take extreme positions to win primaries and shy away from advancing policies that could lead to their ouster by a stauncher party loyalist in the next primary , he says . A recent Harvard report co-authored by Rivkin titled , “ A Recovery Squandered , ” calls for nonpartisan primaries , with the top five vote-getters moving on to the general election . Rivkin also blames hurdles to passing legislation in Congress , such as the filibuster .
Some of the voters surveyed also adhere to more party-line views . Republican Calvin Fink , 54 , of DeLand , Florida , describes the economy and his financial situation as “ excellent , ” giving much of the credit to the sweeping tax cuts spearheaded by President Trump . Fink , the chief financial officer of an accounting firm , says his raises in recent years have far outpaced the national average .
Fink supports government investment in infrastructure and research – but not for programs to combat climate change . While he believes the planet is warming , he doesn ’ t think it ’ s because of human activity . Phasing out fossil fuels , such as coal , he says , “ will put people out of work . ”
He also opposes a substantial hike in the minimum wage , saying , it would lead to big price increases for consumers and shutter some small businesses . “ Are you going to pay $ 10 for a big Mac ? ”
Yet unlike leading lawmakers in the Senate , Fink says he could support small , gradual increases in the federal pay floor over several years .","Most Democratic and Republican voters agree on a wide range of proposals to boost the economy, from upgrading infrastructure to reducing college costs, casting doubt on the conventional belief that pocketbook issues are hopelessly dividing voters in the 2020 election.

On March 23rd, the Fed committed to “using its full range of authorities to provide powerful support for the flow of credit to American families and businesses.” The recently passed relief bill authorizes the Treasury secretary to provide a newly created Fed facility up to a total of $500 billion as collateral (loss protection), which the Fed can leverage to make around $4 trillion in loans.

They are unsure whether they will have access to credit sufficient to remain in business during this crisis. Many of those employers will need assistance to get through the shutdown without laying off or terminating those employees.

Tax reform is extraordinarily unlikely to pass in 2014 , but this provision has sparked a back-room Washington battle between Republicans and Wall Street in the middle of an election year .

But some lenders worry that the still-fragile U.S. housing industry is not ready for such a change .
“ Removing them entirely would be devastating , ” Kelly Powers , vice president for advocacy at the Arizona Mortgage Lenders Association , told FoxNews.com .
Powers argues that there isn ’ t enough private capital to step in and take over , and the results on lending could be damaging .

House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling , R-Texas , has described Fannie and Freddie as the product of a `` government laboratory '' and one that exposes taxpayers to `` unlimited risk . ''
Hensarling 's committee last month passed a bill that would end Fannie and Freddie . A committee spokesman said Tuesday that their bill would end `` the largest bailout in history '' and , by phasing out the government 's role in housing finance , give consumers more choices when shopping for mortgage products .
Powers said she wants to see changes in the way Fannie and Freddie are run , but she doesn ’ t want to operate without a government safety net .
“ None of us want to go through this again , ” she said , referring to the housing crisis . “ Fannie and Freddie have been tainted . We need it revamped and fixed . ”
Independent Bankers of America President and CEO Cam Fine says that if Fannie and Freddie go , a government guarantee will probably still be needed .
“ You don ’ t have to have a Fannie and Freddie , but you need to have a government backstop , ” Fine told FoxNews.com .
Fine , whose organization represents 7,000 community banks across the country , believes it is possible for there to be a robust housing market but says it won ’ t be easy .
“ It is extremely complex and it would be a delicate venture to get all of the moving parts in place , ” Fine said . “ It would take a great deal of coordination and cooperation among private investors , mortgage producers , properly funded and established and all of that would have to be done simultaneously . ”
“ Congress will probably pass some sort of housing policy bill between now and the end of Obama ’ s term , ” Fine said . `` But we ’ re a long , long way away from that happening . ”
Obama ’ s plan offers striking similarities to a bipartisan effort spearheaded in Congress by Sens . Mark Warner , D-Va. , and Bob Corker , R-Tenn .
Their plan gets rid of Fannie and Freddie within five years and replaces them with a system that relies on the private sector to buy mortgages from lenders . The government would only step in to pay out mortgage guarantees after private capital has been exhausted .

Oil prices fell Monday by the most in one day since the 1991 Gulf War . The price of U.S. crude fell as much as 34 % to $ 27.34 a barrel , a stunning drop for one day and the lowest price since early 2016 .
The decline followed Russia ’ s refusal last week to join the OPEC oil cartel in proposed production cuts aimed at supporting prices . Thwarted in its search for cuts , Saudi Arabia , the leading OPEC member , sharply changed course over the weekend by cutting prices and signaling it will ramp up production .
Here is a look at the oil price war and what it could mean over the longer term in the industry as well as for consumers at the gas pump .
A : First came the coronavirus outbreak , which reduced travel and transport , sharply reducing demand for fuel . The international Brent benchmark had fallen from $ 69 at the start of the year to around $ 50 last week .
Then came last week ’ s meeting between OPEC and non-member countries . On the agenda : a production cut of 1.5 million barrels a day , or about 1.5 % of global production . The idea was to keep prices from sagging even more as demand is expected to fall this year . Saudi Arabia , the world ’ s No . 2 oil producer , wanted No . 3 Russia and other nonmembers to take 500,000 barrels per day of the cuts . Since 2016 , the Saudis and the Russians have worked together on production issues .
But this time the Russians balked . They refused to join new cuts , or even to extend previous production cuts that were due to expire at the end of March . And the Saudis hit back , telling customers that they were going to ramp up production and slash prices for Asian customers .
A : First , protecting market share . Both Saudi Arabia and Russia have seen U.S. producers take a chunk of their market , and falling prices help keep customers on board .
Second , Saudi Arabia may hope that the pain of low prices will force a Russian rethink . “ Saudi Arabia has de facto launched a price war against Russia , promising to sell its oil at a discount in order to maximize its oil revenues , ” say analysts at UniCredit bank . “ It appears Saudi Arabia wants to cement its position as the world ’ s top oil exporter and to persuade Moscow to return to the negotiating table . ”
A : Russia may have seen no point in cutting production only to lose market share as U.S. shale producers in Texas and New Mexico take up the slack . Analysts say Saudi Arabia may be underestimating Russia ’ s ability to weather low prices . Both countries are heavily dependent on oil revenues for their state budgets . But Russia says it can balance its budget at around $ 42 a barrel for its own benchmark crude . Saudi Arabia , whose economy is less diverse , needs more than $ 80 per barrel , according to the International Monetary Fund , even though its costs are much lower than Russia ’ s .
What Saudi Arabia has done is to send prices so low that both will feel a serious crunch .
And Russia may have a longer-term target : the U.S. oil industry .
“ The Russians are doing this out of long-term strategic considerations , ” said Tom Adshead , research director for the Macro-Advisory consulting firm in Moscow . “ Their view is that by doing this they can damage the financial health of U.S. shale-oil producers and that by doing this they can take a lot of U.S. capacity offline and thereby remove U.S. producers as a source of competition . The other thing that is on their mind in all this is that if they cut then that will also primarily benefit U.S. producers . ”
“ So they ’ ve decided they ’ re going to take some short-term pain in order to inflict damage on one of their major competitors , ” Adshead said .
Stephen Innes , chief market strategist at financial services firm AxiCorp. , says Russian President Vladimir Putin may also have decided to hit back at the U.S. industry after Washington placed sanctions on Russian state oil company Rosneft for marketing Venezuela ’ s oil .
A : The current low prices could constrain activity in the American shale oil industry . A downturn in oil prices in 2014-2016 hurt companies in places like the Permian Basin in west Texas and eastern New Mexico . According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas , $ 50 per barrel is the price at which it becomes profitable to drill a new well in the U.S. Large producers such as Exxon have already scaled back with prices at $ 50 a barrel . In Texas , the number of active rigs fell from 553 in October 2018 to 398 in January 2020 . Around the same time , the oil industry in Texas shed about 14,000 jobs
“ With the growth phase of the shale boom grinding to a halt due to the lack of investment in the industry , now U.S. shale oil could find itself running into a brick wall , ” says Innes from AxiCorp .
The head of the International Energy Agency , Fatih Birol , believes the U.S. shale industry will survive but the risks are high . He warned countries against being rash with big production decisions : “ This is not a Russian roulette . ”
A : Most of the price of gasoline in the United States simply reflects the price of oil , so lower crude prices should mean lower pump prices with a lag of about six weeks . Right now , they ’ re at $ 2.42 according to the U.S Energy Information Administration . When crude fell to $ 36 in 2016 , prices at the pump averaged $ 2.15 .

The impact is less pronounced in Europe since most of the price is made up of taxes .

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — A clash of two oil titans - Saudi Arabia and Russia - is sending shock waves through energy markets, with wide-ranging implications for consumers and oil companies, including those in the No. 1 producing country, the United States.

Q: WHY ARE OIL PRICES FALLING?

A: First came the coronavirus outbreak , which reduced travel and transport, sharply reducing demand for fuel. The international Brent benchmark had fallen from $69 at the start of the year to around $50 last week.

Then came last week’s meeting between OPEC and non-member countries . On the agenda: a production cut of 1.5 million barrels a day, or about 1.5% of global production. The idea was to keep prices from sagging even more as demand is expected to fall this year. Saudi Arabia, the world’s No. 2 oil producer, wanted No. 3 Russia and other nonmembers to take 500,000 barrels per day of the cuts. Since 2016, the Saudis and the Russians have worked together on production issues.

But this time the Russians balked. They refused to join new cuts, or even to extend previous production cuts that were due to expire at the end of March. And the Saudis hit back, telling customers that they were going to ramp up production and slash prices for Asian customers.

Q: WHAT IS SAUDI ARABIA’S GOAL?

A: First, protecting market share. Both Saudi Arabia and Russia have seen U.S. producers take a chunk of their market, and falling prices help keep customers on board.

Second, Saudi Arabia may hope that the pain of low prices will force a Russian rethink. “Saudi Arabia has de facto launched a price war against Russia, promising to sell its oil at a discount in order to maximize its oil revenues,” say analysts at UniCredit bank. “It appears Saudi Arabia wants to cement its position as the world’s top oil exporter and to persuade Moscow to return to the negotiating table.”

Q: WHAT’S BEHIND RUSSIA’S REFUSAL?

A: Russia may have seen no point in cutting production only to lose market share as U.S. shale producers in Texas and New Mexico take up the slack. Analysts say Saudi Arabia may be underestimating Russia’s ability to weather low prices. Both countries are heavily dependent on oil revenues for their state budgets. But Russia says it can balance its budget at around $42 a barrel for its own benchmark crude. Saudi Arabia, whose economy is less diverse, needs more than $80 per barrel, according to the International Monetary Fund, even though its costs are much lower than Russia’s.

What Saudi Arabia has done is to send prices so low that both will feel a serious crunch.

And Russia may have a longer-term target: the U.S. oil industry.

“The Russians are doing this out of long-term strategic considerations,” said Tom Adshead, research director for the Macro-Advisory consulting firm in Moscow. “Their view is that by doing this they can damage the financial health of U.S. shale-oil producers and that by doing this they can take a lot of U.S. capacity offline and thereby remove U.S. producers as a source of competition. The other thing that is on their mind in all this is that if they cut then that will also primarily benefit U.S. producers.”

“So they’ve decided they’re going to take some short-term pain in order to inflict damage on one of their major competitors,” Adshead said.

Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at financial services firm AxiCorp., says Russian President Vladimir Putin may also have decided to hit back at the U.S. industry after Washington placed sanctions on Russian state oil company Rosneft for marketing Venezuela’s oil.

Q: WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR US PRODUCERS?

A: The current low prices could constrain activity in the American shale oil industry. A downturn in oil prices in 2014-2016 hurt companies in places like the Permian Basin in west Texas and eastern New Mexico. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, $50 per barrel is the price at which it becomes profitable to drill a new well in the U.S. Large producers such as Exxon have already scaled back with prices at $50 a barrel. In Texas, the number of active rigs fell from 553 in October 2018 to 398 in January 2020. Around the same time, the oil industry in Texas shed about 14,000 jobs

“With the growth phase of the shale boom grinding to a halt due to the lack of investment in the industry, now U.S. shale oil could find itself running into a brick wall,” says Innes from AxiCorp.

The head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, believes the U.S. shale industry will survive but the risks are high. He warned countries against being rash with big production decisions: “This is not a Russian roulette.”

Q: WHAT’S IT MEAN FOR PRICES AT THE PUMP?

A: Most of the price of gasoline in the United States simply reflects the price of oil, so lower crude prices should mean lower pump prices with a lag of about six weeks. Right now, they’re at $2.42 according to the U.S Energy Information Administration. When crude fell to $36 in 2016, prices at the pump averaged $2.15. Lower pump prices mean people have more to spend on other goods.

The impact is less pronounced in Europe since most of the price is made up of taxes. Currently, gasoline costs 1.32 euros per liter in Germany, or about $5.70 per gallon.
