Now we are starting to see just how overwhelming those costs are going to be .
My models estimate that the 2020 federal budget deficit—just the deficit—will top $ 4.2 trillion . To put that figure in context , last year the entire federal budget totaled $ 4.4 trillion , which left us with a deficit of $ 984 billion .
Entering 2020—and before coronavirus—the baseline budget deficit was $ 1 trillion . The CBO projects that federal spending from the first four coronavirus response bills will add $ 2.2 trillion to this year ’ s deficit . The remaining $ 1 trillion consists of the economic and technical effects of the economic shutdown—the non-legislative costs such as fewer workers paying taxes and more people signing up for unemployment and Medicaid benefits . ( The CBO seems to assume a slightly lower economic and technical figure than my model , although it has not released details ) . Remarkably , Washington is projected to spend $ 49,000 per household this year—by far the largest total ever .
Economists were alarmed that the deficit—which had been growing steadily since hitting a low of $ 439 billion in 2015—would likely cross the $ 1 trillion threshold in 2020 . Now , the best-case scenario—in which the economy recovers quickly with no additional legislation—shows a $ 4.2 trillion deficit this year , and future deficits that never again fall below $ 1.3 trillion . Combined with the mounting costs of Social Security and Medicare , the deficit will rise back to $ 2.6 trillion by 2030 , and continue growing thereafter .
These new projections mean that this year ’ s budget deficit will reach 19 percent of GDP . That is the largest share of the economy in American history outside of the peak of World War II , and double the 2009 level during the Great Recession .
Over the full decade , the coronavirus recession is projected to add nearly $ 8 trillion to the national debt , pushing the debt held by the public to $ 41 trillion within a decade , or 128 percent of the economy . This would exceed the national debt at the height of World War II . And while that war ended before the debt could rise further , the expanding Social Security and Medicare shortfalls will continue to bury future budgets in red ink .
First , unfortunately , they may need to spend more . America faces three crises that must be solved sequentially : The pandemic crisis , the economic crisis , and the deficit crisis . The pandemic must be addressed to a satisfactory level before the economy can begin to recover ( allowing for differing definitions of “ satisfactory ” ) . And then Congress must spend to keep families , businesses , and industries afloat during the recession before they can cut the deficit . Allowing entire industries to disappear and the economy to enter a prolonged depression would cost more than any economic legislation to avert that outcome .
Yet this does not mean that Congress should spend beyond what is necessary to rebuild the economy . It should resist ineffective Keynesian stimulus ( especially infrastructure stimulus ) , as well as bailouts of industries or state pensions whose financial problems predate the pandemic .
As soon as the economy recovers , Congress ’ s top economic priority should be to address the budget crisis . The $ 8 trillion coronavirus tab essentially accelerates the prior projections of federal debt growth by six years , and therefore gives lawmakers six fewer years to avert a potential debt crisis in which rising debt and interest costs would overwhelm Washington ’ s ability to tax or borrow .
In fact , Congress could soon begin enacting savings policies and triggers that would automatically occur a few years down the road when the economy recovers . This is not unprecedented : The 1983 Social Security reforms contained policy savings to be implemented on a preset schedule over the subsequent 44 years ( no additional legislation required ) . If lawmakers feel compelled by the economic shutdown to spend today , the least they can do is accompany that spending with savings reforms to be implemented as soon as the economic recovery allows it .
Lawmakers could begin with broad budget targets , such as declining deficits , or the Swiss system that limits spending growth to recent revenue growth ( with automatic adjustments for booms or recessions ) . Lawmakers could spend beyond these levels only with a supermajority vote .
From there , program-by-program triggers can be put in place . Social Security and Medicare could each be put on long-term budgets , with automatic reforms implemented ( on both the revenue and spending side ) if program deficits begin to exceed the preset path . Federal grants to states can be automatically pared back whenever the economy ( and state tax revenues ) grows quickly . Discretionary spending can be capped and then enforced with stronger supermajority requirements than prevailed during the last decade ’ s Budget Control Act .

How should lawmakers address this unsustainable avalanche of debt?

First, unfortunately, they may need to spend more. America faces three crises that must be solved sequentially: The pandemic crisis, the economic crisis, and the deficit crisis. The pandemic must be addressed to a satisfactory level before the economy can begin to recover (allowing for differing definitions of “satisfactory”). And then Congress must spend to keep families, businesses, and industries afloat during the recession before they can cut the deficit.

Yet this does not mean that Congress should spend beyond what is necessary to rebuild the economy. It should resist ineffective Keynesian stimulus (especially infrastructure stimulus), as well as bailouts of industries or state pensions whose financial problems predate the pandemic.

As soon as the economy recovers, Congress’s top economic priority should be to address the budget crisis. The $8 trillion coronavirus tab essentially accelerates the prior projections of federal debt growth by six years, and therefore gives lawmakers six fewer years to avert a potential debt crisis in which rising debt and interest costs would overwhelm Washington’s ability to tax or borrow.

In fact, Congress could soon begin enacting savings policies and triggers that would automatically occur a few years down the road when the economy recovers. This is not unprecedented: The 1983 Social Security reforms contained policy savings to be implemented on a preset schedule over the subsequent 44 years (no additional legislation required).

Lawmakers could begin with broad budget targets, such as declining deficits, or the Swiss system that limits spending growth to recent revenue growth (with automatic adjustments for booms or recessions). Lawmakers could spend beyond these levels only with a supermajority vote.

From there, program-by-program triggers can be put in place. Social Security and Medicare could each be put on long-term budgets, with automatic reforms implemented (on both the revenue and spending side) if program deficits begin to exceed the preset path. Federal grants to states can be automatically pared back whenever the economy (and state tax revenues) grows quickly.

David","Stocks were bludgeoned in yet another volatile session on Wednesday , sinking to a three year low with worldwide cases of the coronavirus soaring above 200,000 , amid panic selling that nearly wiped out all of the gains made since President Donald Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20 , 2017 .
The ongoing COVID-19 crisis has forced governments around the world to consider stimulus measures and imposing stiff restrictions to prevent further spreading . However , the economic fallout is already being felt , with several indicators deteriorating sharply , and Wall Street predicting a recession this year .
“ There is no longer doubt that the longest global expansion on record will end this quarter , ” JPMorgan Chase economist Bruce Kasman wrote in a note on Wednesday . “ The key outlook issue now is gauging the depth and the duration of the 2020 recession . ”
Wednesday ’ s volatile session shaved over 1,300 points off the Dow Jones Industrial Average , which settled below the psychologically-important level of 20,000 — its lowest close since February 2017 and deep in bear market territory . Oil ’ s demand and supply woes have also dragged the commodity to its lowest levels in nearly two decades .
Meanwhile , the S & P 500 plummeted , triggering a market-wide temporary halt to trading before closing down by over 5 % on the day . This was the second time in three days the blue-chip index invoked a so-called “ circuit breaker ” during regular trading , which is intended to prevent extreme losses .
Traders also booked some profits after a brisk rally helped investors recoup some of Monday ’ s ugly losses that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average sink in its worst day since the Black Monday sell-off of 1987 .

Stocks were bludgeoned in yet another volatile session on Wednesday, sinking to a three year low with worldwide cases of the coronavirus soaring above 200,000, amid panic selling that nearly wiped out all of the gains made since President Donald Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2017.

The ongoing COVID-19 crisis has forced governments around the world to consider stimulus measures and imposing stiff restrictions to prevent further spreading. However, the economic fallout is already being felt, with several indicators deteriorating sharply, and Wall Street predicting a recession this year.

“There is no longer doubt that the longest global expansion on record will end this quarter,” JPMorgan Chase economist Bruce Kasman wrote in a note on Wednesday. “The key outlook issue now is gauging the depth and the duration of the 2020 recession.”

Wednesday’s volatile session shaved over 1,300 points off the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which settled below the psychologically-important level of 20,000 — its lowest close since February 2017 and deep in bear market territory. Oil’s demand and supply woes have also dragged the commodity to its lowest levels in nearly two decades.

Meanwhile, the S&P 500 plummeted, triggering a market-wide temporary halt to trading before closing down by over 5% on the day. This was the second time in three days the blue-chip index invoked a so-called “circuit breaker” during regular trading, which is intended to prevent extreme losses.

Traders also booked some profits after a brisk rally helped investors recoup some of Monday’s ugly losses that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average sink in its worst day since the Black Monday sell-off of 1987.

USA TODAY

The stock market suffered its worst slide in nearly two months Thursday as the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average ended down nearly 265 points and Apple spearheaded a sharp drop in technology stocks.

In what is shaping up as Wall Street's fourth consecutive day of triple-digit moves, the Dow closed down 264.26 points, 1.5%, to end below 17,000 at 16,945.80. Throughout most of the day, all 30 stocks in the average traded lower.

The Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 32.31 points, 1.6%, to finish at 1965.99. And the worst losses of the day were in the tech-packed Nasdaq composite, which ended down 88.47 points, 1.9%, to 4466.75.

Nasdaq's losses were driven by a 3.8% decline in Apple shares, which finished the trading session a tad below $98.

Although the Dow gained 154 points Wednesday, all of its other tripe-digit moves have been on the downside since it set a new closing high on Friday -- the same day the biggest-ever initial public offering, Alibaba Group, debuted on the New York Stock Exchange. Both the Nasdaq and the S&P were down for the fourth day of the past five sessions.

Thursday's drop was blamed on increasing concerns about the global economy and a growing backlash against problems consumers are reporting with Apple's latest software updates and its new product launches, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.

The rising volatility on Wall Street is causing concern after the stock market enjoyed a long run of relatively uneventful trading earlier in September. A measure of volatility known as the ""fear gauge"" jumped 25% on Thursday.

Analysts are worried the buildup of complacency among investors and the approach of what could be a disappointing third-quarter earnings season could mean more trouble in the weeks ahead.

Still, damage is relatively minor, given that the Dow and S&P are both down roughly 2% from the record highs they set last week.

VOLATILITY:Wild swings continue as Dow plunges

FEAR FACTOR:VIX jumps 25%

Apple (AAPL) was a standout as its shares fell for a second straight day and dropped below $100 again after glitches with the tech giant's new phones and operating system came to light. .

APPLE:Stock dinged $23 billion since iPhone 6

Fixed-income investments appeared to benefit from the flight out of stocks. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves opposite its price, fell to 2.51% from 2.57% Wednesday as investors sought the relative safe haven of U.S. Treasuries.

In economic news, durable goods orders plunged 18.2% in August, thanks to a sharp drop in aircraft orders. Orders for durable goods excluding the volatile transportation category rose 0.7%.

Applications for unemployment benefits rose 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 293,000 last week. Despite the rise, applications remain near pre-recession levels.

Asian markets were mixed as Japan's Nikkei index jumped 0.3% to 16,734.14 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 0.6% to 23,768.13.

European markets were trading lower and losses accelerated after Wall Street's decline: Britain's FTSE 100 dropped 1% and Germany's DAX fell 1.6%.

Stocks rallied Wednesday as the Dow ended up more than 150 points and the S&P 500 broke a three-day losing streak.

Trump has advocated for aggressive goals in recent days , and said Saturday on Fox News that he plans to base his decision on when to adjust federal social distancing guidelines and ask businesses to reopen “ on a lot of facts and a lot of instincts . ”
But two of his health advisers , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr. Anthony Fauci and Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn , argued Sunday for a decision based only on the former . In separate appearances on CNN ’ s State of the Union and ABC ’ s Meet the Press , both officials emphasized that their recommendations would be based solely on constantly changing data , hesitated to make firm or sweeping predictions , and challenged the notion that there is a single , set time when the entire country will be “ ready ” to resume life as it once was .
“ It is not going to be a light switch that we say , ‘ Okay it ’ s now June , July whatever ’ — click , the light switch goes back on , ” Fauci said on CNN . “ It ’ s going to be depending where you are in the country , the nature of the outbreak that you already experienced , and the threat of an outbreak that you may not have experienced . ”
Trump has made it clear that he would like to see relaxed social distancing and businesses reopened soon as possible . Less than three weeks ago , he said he hoped to have the economy “ opened up and raring to go by Easter , ” a goal that both health officials and economists warned would backfire because it would accelerate the spread of the coronavirus and likely lead to the rapid reshuttering of the economy . Recent reports suggest the president now hopes to begin a return to normal by May 1 , and there is growing pressure from some of his non-scientific advisers — as well as some Fox News personalities — to do so .
On Fox News ’ s Justice with Judge Jeanine Saturday , Trump twice emphasized that conditions would allow the economy to begin returning to normal “ soon , ” and when asked how he will decide when is the right time to advise businesses to reopen , the president gave a less measured answer than Fauci .
“ I will be basing it on a lot of very smart people , a lot of professionals , doctors , and business leaders , ” he said . “ There are a lot of things that go into a decision like that . And it ’ s going to be based on a lot of facts and a lot of instincts also . Whether we like it or not , there is a certain instinct to it . But we have to get our country back . ”
This is not the first time the president ’ s stance on his administration ’ s coronavirus response hasn ’ t exactly aligned with the stance of his experts . But the contrast between Trump ’ s eagerness to reopen the country based on his gut feelings and the cautious rhetoric of top health officials does help underscore how Trump ’ s decision-making process on the coronavirus is detached from expert counsel and haphazard in its execution .
Trump ’ s health officials have been far more cautious and hesitant to offer gut-level appraisals about the future of the economy or when it will be safe to end social distancing .
ABC ’ s Martha Raddatz asked Hahn on Sunday if May 1 was “ a good target ” for reopening the economy . He responded by declining to set a date for the decision .
“ It is a target , and obviously we ’ re hopeful about that target , but I think it ’ s just too early to be able to tell that we see light at the end of the tunnel , ” Hahn said . “ I think it ’ s just too early for us to say whether May 1 is that date . ”
And Hahn was also careful to temper the optimism some have felt in seeing the confirmed case rate begin to decrease in a number of coronavirus hotspots , like New York . When asked if the worst has passed with coronavirus infections , Hahn said that the models show that “ we ’ re very close to the peak , ” but emphasized that it ’ s important to “ take this day by day as the data come in , because this has to be a data-driven approach . ”
Fauci , too , during his CNN appearance on Sunday , was emphatic about how difficult it is to prognosticate in such a complex situation .
“ You ’ re trying to balance two things : You want to make sure you don ’ t do something prematurely and precipitously ; at the same time you pay attention to the need to try and get back to normal , ” he told Tapper .
When Tapper repeatedly asked when exactly the economy might be restarted , Fauci replied , “ I think it could probably start at least in some ways maybe next month — and again , Jake , it ’ s so difficult to make those kinds of predictions . ”
“ We are hoping that at the end of the month we can look around and say , ‘ Okay , is there any element here that we can safely and cautiously start pulling back on ? ’ If so , do it , if not , then just continue to hunker down , ” Fauci added .
Whether the president takes these words to heart remains to be seen . But he has signaled recently he intends to create a concrete plan to see the economy functioning as normal again .

banking_and_finance,American Spectator,2,https://spectator.org/a-crash-course-on-stock-market-crashes-and-corrections/,OPINION: A Crash Course on Stock Market Crashes — and Corrections,,"Ben Stein, Veronique De Rugy, Bob Luddy","Bear in mind , I have been writing for some time and saying on TV for some time that the market was too high , that the next move in the market was probably down , and sharply , and that we were almost surely in for some inflation , which would affect stock market prices .
All of this turned out to be true , but I am here now to offer some hope :
1 . Stock market crashes come in two types . One is when the market itself has some flaw , like a nuclear reactor whose cooling system does not work properly , and causes the reactor to melt down . The other is when the market is discounting or forecasting some serious economic turmoil in the larger economy .
2 . The Super Crash of 1929-1931 was both of these in one . Its sharp one-day fall was the result of a huge flaw in the market mechanism itself : allowing the buying of stock on very slender margin , that is , with borrowed money secured by the stock itself .
In the Super Crash of fall 1929 to fall 1931 , stocks began to fall in what might otherwise have been an orderly correction . But so much stock had been bought with only 10 % down that even a small correction required the automatic sale of the stock securing the loan to pay off the lender .
Those sales in turn led to further falls in stock prices , further sales to pay off margin , and then to a disorderly rout as margin was called throughout the system .
It was all compounded by a very serious farm sector depression that had been going on for most of the 1920s because of immense over-production . That , in turn , had led to the large-scale failure of banks in rural America . Their relationship as borrowers from New York and Chicago banks led to the collapse of those banks . The Federal Reserve , in an access of insanity , failed to rescue those banks and the collapse became general across the nation and the world .
It stopped with the federal rescue of large banks and the country grew stupendously with the rearmament associated with World War II .
3 . There has never been another nationwide downturn even remotely as bad as the one in the 1930s . But there have been other crashes in the stock market .
The stock market had a long , dismal period from 1966 to roughly 1980 as the nation fell into inflation and bond interest rates rose so much that they became a more attractive investment vehicle than stocks .
That was ended by the smothering of inflation by Paul Volcker , Ronald Reagan , and , yes , Jimmy Carter . After inflation was tamed , the stock market had several glorious years until the crash of 1987 .
That was a crash caused by a flaw in the market itself . Some clever devils had created a device called “ portfolio insurance. ” It was complex but it was basically a replay of the 1929 crash caused by buying on margin . Portfolio insurance caused the stock market to crash because it automatically sold “ put ” options on stocks as stocks fell . Supposedly , this guaranteed that investors ’ losses would be limited . Instead , it led to a cascade of sell orders as futures prices plummeted and made it possible to make money by selling stocks and buying the puts . This in turn made the puts point to further stock market downturns and so stocks were sold to correlate the cash price of the stocks with the futures put prices . ( This is a schematic . It was actually somewhat more complex than this but not a lot . )
It is widely believed that this would have led to a China Syndrome in which there was no bottom to the market except that the Fed bought call options and stabilized the downturn . Now , note — the 1987 Crash took place in the midst of a booming economy . It was an epiphenomenon not connected with a larger problem in the economy like inflation or a banking failure . Within less than a year , the market fully recovered . There simply was no reason for a lasting crash once the portfolio insurance was laid to rest .
4 . There was another SuperCrash in 2008-2009 . This one had both internal market causes and wider national causes . The internal market cause was a system of inter-bank lending that generally went under the rubric of “ derivatives ” and “ swaps. ” Many of these arrangements were tethered to actual or forecast rates of default on home mortgage loans .
When those rates rose , the value of the swaps and derivatives fell . One very large bank , Lehman Brothers , failed because of its large exposure to derivatives . It could have been saved but the Treasury and the Fed were too limited in intelligence to do so . From that we got a general financial crisis as banks were afraid to lend . Commercial paper ( basically short term loans ) was not being rolled over . Businesses faced credit Doomsday and there was danger of a genuine Great Depression .
This was avoided by the government ’ s TARP program to stabilize the banks , Bank of America ’ s salvation of the venerable Merrill Lynch , and by a prolonged policy of ultra-low interest rates . We are still living in that latter world .
5 . Now , right now , we have another correction of staggering speed and violence . Why ? Part of the reason is internal to the market . It just got too darned high . Markets often shift into super optimism after long periods of growth , and this is what we got . The market was an order of magnitude too high compared with historic precedent for low inflation prosperity . In a way , the recent downturn is a return to nothing more or less than sanity .
But there is also the lurking danger of inflation . Wages are starting to rise . Commodities are rising . And we can see lightning flashes of higher interest rates , which would drive down stocks as people bought bonds instead .
Stock markets hate inflation . Just a spark of it is enough to inspire caution and what we are getting now is caution .

At least that ’ s what I have to tell myself to sleep tonight .","Now for a few words about the stock market.

Bear in mind, I have been writing for some time and saying on TV for some time that the market was too high, that the next move in the market was probably down, and sharply, and that we were almost surely in for some inflation, which would affect stock market prices.

All of this turned out to be true, but I am here now to offer some hope:

1. Stock market crashes come in two types. One is when the market itself has some flaw, like a nuclear reactor whose cooling system does not work properly, and causes the reactor to melt down. The other is when the market is discounting or forecasting some serious economic turmoil in the larger economy.

2. The Super Crash of 1929-1931 was both of these in one. Its sharp one-day fall was the result of a huge flaw in the market mechanism itself: allowing the buying of stock on very slender margin, that is, with borrowed money secured by the stock itself.

In the Super Crash of fall 1929 to fall 1931, stocks began to fall in what might otherwise have been an orderly correction. But so much stock had been bought with only 10% down that even a small correction required the automatic sale of the stock securing the loan to pay off the lender.

Those sales in turn led to further falls in stock prices, further sales to pay off margin, and then to a disorderly rout as margin was called throughout the system.

It was all compounded by a very serious farm sector depression that had been going on for most of the 1920s because of immense over-production. That, in turn, had led to the large-scale failure of banks in rural America. Their relationship as borrowers from New York and Chicago banks led to the collapse of those banks. The Federal Reserve, in an access of insanity, failed to rescue those banks and the collapse became general across the nation and the world.

It stopped with the federal rescue of large banks and the country grew stupendously with the rearmament associated with World War II.

3. There has never been another nationwide downturn even remotely as bad as the one in the 1930s. But there have been other crashes in the stock market.

The stock market had a long, dismal period from 1966 to roughly 1980 as the nation fell into inflation and bond interest rates rose so much that they became a more attractive investment vehicle than stocks.

That was ended by the smothering of inflation by Paul Volcker, Ronald Reagan, and, yes, Jimmy Carter. After inflation was tamed, the stock market had several glorious years until the crash of 1987.

That was a crash caused by a flaw in the market itself. Some clever devils had created a device called “portfolio insurance.” It was complex but it was basically a replay of the 1929 crash caused by buying on margin. Portfolio insurance caused the stock market to crash because it automatically sold “put” options on stocks as stocks fell. Supposedly, this guaranteed that investors’ losses would be limited. Instead, it led to a cascade of sell orders as futures prices plummeted and made it possible to make money by selling stocks and buying the puts. This in turn made the puts point to further stock market downturns and so stocks were sold to correlate the cash price of the stocks with the futures put prices. (This is a schematic. It was actually somewhat more complex than this but not a lot.)

It is widely believed that this would have led to a China Syndrome in which there was no bottom to the market except that the Fed bought call options and stabilized the downturn. Now, note — the 1987 Crash took place in the midst of a booming economy. It was an epiphenomenon not connected with a larger problem in the economy like inflation or a banking failure. Within less than a year, the market fully recovered. There simply was no reason for a lasting crash once the portfolio insurance was laid to rest.

4. There was another SuperCrash in 2008-2009. This one had both internal market causes and wider national causes. The internal market cause was a system of inter-bank lending that generally went under the rubric of “derivatives” and “swaps.” Many of these arrangements were tethered to actual or forecast rates of default on home mortgage loans.

When those rates rose, the value of the swaps and derivatives fell. One very large bank, Lehman Brothers, failed because of its large exposure to derivatives. It could have been saved but the Treasury and the Fed were too limited in intelligence to do so. From that we got a general financial crisis as banks were afraid to lend. Commercial paper (basically short term loans) was not being rolled over. Businesses faced credit Doomsday and there was danger of a genuine Great Depression.

This was avoided by the government’s TARP program to stabilize the banks, Bank of America’s salvation of the venerable Merrill Lynch, and by a prolonged policy of ultra-low interest rates. We are still living in that latter world.

5. Now, right now, we have another correction of staggering speed and violence. Why? Part of the reason is internal to the market. It just got too darned high. Markets often shift into super optimism after long periods of growth, and this is what we got. The market was an order of magnitude too high compared with historic precedent for low inflation prosperity. In a way, the recent downturn is a return to nothing more or less than sanity.

But there is also the lurking danger of inflation. Wages are starting to rise. Commodities are rising. And we can see lightning flashes of higher interest rates, which would drive down stocks as people bought bonds instead.

Stock markets hate inflation. Just a spark of it is enough to inspire caution and what we are getting now is caution.

6. There are also a few other worries: The deficit is ballooning like a monster. Whatever good the tax cuts may have done might well be undone by higher deficits. And no, there is no serious model of “dynamic scoring” that says larger deficits lead to lower deficits, which is the basic ridiculous premise of the tax cutters. There have certainly been times when there has been great prosperity after tax cuts. But there have been times of great prosperity after tax increases, too. Fear of inflationary deficits will not help anyone.

There is also a Godzilla monster lurking on the ocean floor, too. “Bitcoin.” No one knows for sure what it is or why it has any value at all. It’s bound to go to close to zero, and when it does, it will take a lot of decent people with it. This will not help the national mood. I would feel differently about it if anyone had ever been able to explain to me what it is or why it had any value. No one has. Charlie Munger says it’s a fraud. I don’t think I want to bet against Charlie Munger. Neither should you.

So, my humble thought, which could be totally wrong: there is no general weakness in the economy. There is no 2009 financial system super catastrophe waiting to happen. The market just got way ahead of itself in an uncertain environment about inflation. The rout may continue for a while but it’s not the end of the world as we know it. At least that’s what I have to tell myself to sleep tonight.",www.spectator.org,right,oUr2GG3e1QUwJkUO

Here’s are 5 reasons that the market is falling:

COVID-19

Fear of the COVID-19 disease infecting the U.S. is intensifying. The illness derived from the novel coronavirus, SARS-COV-2, which originated in Wuhan, China, late last year, is starting to affect global trade and travel and taking a bite out of confidence about earnings and economic growth.

Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Tuesday that “the disruption of daily life might be severe.”

The World Health Organization hasn’t declared the viral infection a pandemic, but the disease, from the family of viruses known as SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, has sickened people in China, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Italy and Iran. And according to Reuters, Austria, Spain, Croatia and Switzerland have also confirmed their first cases.

The virus has virtually crippled swaths of manufacturing in China, the second largest economy in the world, and the country is a big buyer of products and services from other countries. U.S. technology companies such as Apple Inc. AAPL, -4.20% depend on Chinese supplies.

The 2020 election

Uncertainty about the U.S. presidential election’s outcome is also starting to drive markets, strategists and analysts argue. A number of them think that if Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont who characterizes himself as a democratic socialist, wins the Democratic presidential nomination, and possibly even the presidency, stocks would take a hit as he is perceived by some as an antibusiness candidate. “The risk to U.S. stocks is pretty significant if Bernie gets the nomination,” said Ed Moya, a senior market analyst with OANDA.

Lofty valuations

Even before the market slump this week, the value of stocks has been viewed as rich.

One measure of stock-market values showed that the S&P 500 index was trading at 18.9 times the weighted aggregate consensus forward earnings estimate among analysts polled by MarketWatch. That is up from 16.2 a year ago, and, aside from a brief point early in 2018, it is the highest forward price-to-earnings ratio for the benchmark index since May 2002.

The bond market

Government bonds yields have been sliding steadily as investors seek safe havens, and thus drive up bond prices, amid doubts about global economic growth in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.

The 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, -19.60% carved fell to a record low below 1.32% earlier Tuesday, and the 30-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD30Y, -10.27% rate notched its all-time low last week.

Recession fears

Bond investors fear that the coronavirus might result in a global economic slowdown that might wash up on U.S. shores as a full-fledged recession. MarketWatch economics writer Rex Nutting explained the potential for an uncontained outbreak of COVID-19 this way: “Much of the immediate economic impact of a pandemic can be traced to the efforts to contain it, rather than from the effects of the disease itself. As we attempt to quarantine those who might spread the disease, we shut down a lot of economic activity.”

Dianne Feinstein of California and three of her Senate colleagues reported selling off stocks worth millions of dollars in the days before the coronavirus outbreak crashed the market , according to reports .
The data is listed on a U.S. Senate website containing financial disclosures from Senate members .
Feinstein , who serves as ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee , and her husband sold between $ 1.5 million and $ 6 million in stock in California biotech company Allogene Therapeutics , between Jan. 31 and Feb. 18 , The New York Times reported .
SENS . RICHARD BURR , KELLY LOEFFLER SOLD MILLIONS IN STOCK BEFORE CORONAVIRUS CRIPPLED MARKETS , REPORTS FIND
Feinstein defended herself in a series of tweets on Friday , saying she has `` no control '' over her assets and the stocks in question were her husband 's transactions .
`` During my Senate career I ’ ve held all assets in a blind trust of which I have no control . Reports that I sold any assets are incorrect , as are reports that I was at a January 24 briefing on coronavirus , which I was unable to attend , '' she tweeted .
`` Under Senate rules I report my husband 's financial transactions . I have no input into his decisions . My husband in January and February sold shares of a cancer therapy company . This company is unrelated to any work on the coronavirus and the sale was unrelated to the situation . ''
When questioned by the newspaper , a spokesman for the Democrat from San Francisco also said Feinstein wasn ’ t directly involved in the sale .
“ All of Senator Feinstein ’ s assets are in a blind trust , ” the spokesman , Tom Mentzer , told the Times . “ She has no involvement in her husband ’ s financial decisions . ”
“ All of Senator Feinstein ’ s assets are in a blind trust . She has no involvement in her husband ’ s financial decisions. ” — Tom Mentzer , Feinstein spokesman
Reports identified the three other senators as Richard Burr of North Carolina , Kelly Loeffler of Georgia and James Inhofe of Oklahoma , all Republicans .
Burr , chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , used more than 30 transactions to dump between $ 628,000 and $ 1.72 million on Feb. 13 , according to ProPublica .
The report said the transactions involved a significant percentage of the senator ’ s holdings and took place about a week before the impact of the virus outbreak sent stock prices plunging to the point where gains made during President Trump ’ s term in office were largely erased .
“ Senator Burr filed a financial disclosure form for personal transactions made several weeks before the U.S. and financial markets showed signs of volatility due to the growing coronavirus outbreak , ” a Burr spokesperson said . “ As the situation continues to evolve daily , he has been deeply concerned by the steep and sudden toll this pandemic is taking on our economy . ”
On Friday , the senator tweeted an updated statement saying he relied only on `` public news reports '' to guide his decision on the sale . Still , he said he 's asked for a Senate Ethics Committee review of his actions .
Burr was an author of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act , a law that helps determine the federal response to situations such as the coronavirus outbreak , ProPublica reported . Burr ’ s office would not comment on what kind of information Burr might have received about coronavirus prior to his stock sales , the outlet reported .
NPR reported that Burr made ominous comments about coronavirus behind closed doors last month .
“ There ’ s one thing that I can tell you about this : It is much more aggressive in its transmission than anything that we have seen in recent history , ” Burr said at a Feb. 27 meeting of business leaders in Washington . “ It is probably more akin to the 1918 pandemic . ”
Loeffler was appointed to the Senate in December by Georgia Gov . Brian Kemp after incumbent Sen. Johnny Isakson resigned because of health issues – despite allies of President Trump having urged Kemp to select Rep. Doug Collins instead .
Loeffler and her husband , Jeffrey Sprecher , chairman of the New York Stock Exchange , sold stock Jan. 24 , the same day she sat in on a briefing from two members of Trump ’ s Coronavirus Task Force , The Daily Beast reported .
Between that day and Feb. 14 , the couple sold stock worth a total between $ 1.2 million and $ 3.1 million , the report said . In addition to the sales , they also purchased stock in a maker of software that helps people work at home – just before millions of Americans were forced to leave their offices because of the outbreak , the report said .
Loeffler slammed the Daily Beast report as a `` ridiculous and baseless attack '' in a pair of late-night tweets .
`` This is a ridiculous and baseless attack . I do not make investment decisions for my portfolio . Investment decisions are made by multiple third-party advisors without my or my husband 's knowledge or involvement , '' Loeffler wrote . `` As confirmed in the periodic transaction report to Senate Ethics , I was informed of these purchases and sales on February 16 , 2020 — three weeks after they were made . ''
In an interview Friday with Fox News ’ Ed Henry , Loeffler again said any claim of insider trading is “ absolutely false . ”
She added , “ I ’ m not involved in the decisions ” of buying and selling , while saying she ’ d cooperate if any investigation is launched .
Inhofe sold as much as $ 400,000 in stock all on Jan. 27 , in companies such as PayPal , Apple and real estate company Brookfield Asset Management , The New York Times reported .
But in a written statement , Inhofe pushed back by saying he was not at a late January briefing and , further , does not have involvement in investment choices .
The statement said : “ The New York Times allegations are completely baseless and 100 percent false . I was not at the briefing on January 24 . I was meeting with pro-life kids from Oklahoma here for the March for Life and the new nominee to be U.S . Ambassador to Tanzania . I do not have any involvement in my investment decisions . In December 2018 , shortly after becoming chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , I instructed my financial advisor to move me out of all stocks and into mutual funds to avoid any appearance of controversy . My advisor has been doing so faithfully since that time and I am not aware of or consulted about any transactions . ”

SENS. RICHARD BURR, KELLY LOEFFLER SOLD MILLIONS IN STOCK BEFORE CORONAVIRUS CRIPPLED MARKETS, REPORTS FIND

Feinstein defended herself in a series of tweets on Friday, saying she has ""no control"" over her assets and the stocks in question were her husband's transactions.

""During my Senate career I’ve held all assets in a blind trust of which I have no control. Reports that I sold any assets are incorrect, as are reports that I was at a January 24 briefing on coronavirus, which I was unable to attend,"" she tweeted.

""Under Senate rules I report my husband's financial transactions. I have no input into his decisions. My husband in January and February sold shares of a cancer therapy company. This company is unrelated to any work on the coronavirus and the sale was unrelated to the situation.""

When questioned by the newspaper, a spokesman for the Democrat from San Francisco also said Feinstein wasn’t directly involved in the sale.

“All of Senator Feinstein’s assets are in a blind trust,” the spokesman, Tom Mentzer, told the Times. “She has no involvement in her husband’s financial decisions.”

Reports identified the three other senators as Richard Burr of North Carolina, Kelly Loeffler of Georgia and James Inhofe of Oklahoma, all Republicans.

Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, used more than 30 transactions to dump between $628,000 and $1.72 million on Feb. 13, according to ProPublica.

The report said the transactions involved a significant percentage of the senator’s holdings and took place about a week before the impact of the virus outbreak sent stock prices plunging to the point where gains made during President Trump’s term in office were largely erased.

“Senator Burr filed a financial disclosure form for personal transactions made several weeks before the U.S. and financial markets showed signs of volatility due to the growing coronavirus outbreak,” a Burr spokesperson said. “As the situation continues to evolve daily, he has been deeply concerned by the steep and sudden toll this pandemic is taking on our economy.”

On Friday, the senator tweeted an updated statement saying he relied only on ""public news reports"" to guide his decision on the sale. Still, he said he's asked for a Senate Ethics Committee review of his actions.

Burr was an author of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, a law that helps determine the federal response to situations such as the coronavirus outbreak, ProPublica reported. Burr’s office would not comment on what kind of information Burr might have received about coronavirus prior to his stock sales, the outlet reported.

NPR reported that Burr made ominous comments about coronavirus behind closed doors last month.

“There’s one thing that I can tell you about this: It is much more aggressive in its transmission than anything that we have seen in recent history,” Burr said at a Feb. 27 meeting of business leaders in Washington. “It is probably more akin to the 1918 pandemic.”

Loeffler was appointed to the Senate in December by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp after incumbent Sen. Johnny Isakson resigned because of health issues – despite allies of President Trump having urged Kemp to select Rep. Doug Collins instead.

Loeffler and her husband, Jeffrey Sprecher, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, sold stock Jan. 24, the same day she sat in on a briefing from two members of Trump’s Coronavirus Task Force, The Daily Beast reported.

Between that day and Feb. 14, the couple sold stock worth a total between $1.2 million and $3.1 million, the report said. In addition to the sales, they also purchased stock in a maker of software that helps people work at home – just before millions of Americans were forced to leave their offices because of the outbreak, the report said.

Loeffler slammed the Daily Beast report as a ""ridiculous and baseless attack"" in a pair of late-night tweets.

""This is a ridiculous and baseless attack. I do not make investment decisions for my portfolio. Investment decisions are made by multiple third-party advisors without my or my husband's knowledge or involvement,"" Loeffler wrote. ""As confirmed in the periodic transaction report to Senate Ethics, I was informed of these purchases and sales on February 16, 2020 — three weeks after they were made.""

In an interview Friday with Fox News’ Ed Henry, Loeffler again said any claim of insider trading is “absolutely false.”

She added, “I’m not involved in the decisions” of buying and selling, while saying she’d cooperate if any investigation is launched.

Inhofe sold as much as $400,000 in stock all on Jan. 27, in companies such as PayPal, Apple and real estate company Brookfield Asset Management, The New York Times reported.

But in a written statement, Inhofe pushed back by saying he was not at a late January briefing and, further, does not have involvement in investment choices.

The statement said: “The New York Times allegations are completely baseless and 100 percent false. I was not at the briefing on January 24. I was meeting with pro-life kids from Oklahoma here for the March for Life and the new nominee to be U.S. Ambassador to Tanzania. I do not have any involvement in my investment decisions. In December 2018, shortly after becoming chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I instructed my financial advisor to move me out of all stocks and into mutual funds to avoid any appearance of controversy. My advisor has been doing so faithfully since that time and I am not aware of or consulted about any transactions.”

Former Goldman Sachs banker Steven Mnuchin has been seen at Trump Tower amid rumors that he’s the leading candidate for Treasury secretary. Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross appears headed to the Commerce Department. Steve Bannon, another Goldman alum, will work steps from the Oval Office. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon remains a possibility as Treasury secretary and will serve as an outside adviser if he doesn't get the job.

It’s a restoration of Wall Street power — and a potential flip in the way the industry is regulated — perhaps unparalleled in American history.

“You would have to go back to the 1920s to see so much Wall Street influence coming to Washington,” said Charles Geisst, a Wall Street historian at Manhattan College. “It’s the most dramatic turnaround one could imagine. That’s the truly astonishing part.”

Evidence of Wall Street’s improved prospects is everywhere.

The Dodd-Frank financial reform law that bedeviled the industry for years and cost banks untold billions could soon get burned to the ground. Bank stocks are soaring. Trump is going around Manhattan promising to lower rich people’s taxes. And industry critics led by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren — long in ascendance — are seeing their populist power deflate.

The anti-banker culture of Washington has been turned on its head in an instant. And the industry can barely believe its good fortune. “Those of us who have been around D.C. for a long time, are we relieved that we are not going to be subpoenaed every week? Of course we are,” said Richard Hunt, head of the Consumer Bankers Association.

Bank stocks are up by around 10 percent since Trump’s win, according to the KBW Bank Index, as investors contemplate an agenda tailormade for the industry including deregulation and potentially higher interest rates sparked by significant deficit spending. Bankers themselves also stand to make a killing. Massive tax cuts, including an elimination of the estate tax and big reductions for top earners seem like slam dunks in Trump’s Washington.

Wall Street bankers and their Washington lobbyists are quietly celebrating. They went from expecting fresh crackdowns from a Hillary Clinton administration with Warren wielding heavy influence to the cusp of a deregulatory bonanza with Republicans in complete control of Washington.

“There is a joke going around here that if I’d have known how good Trump was going to be for Wall Street, I’d have campaigned for him,” said one Goldman Sachs executive who declined to be identified by name speaking about the incoming president. “What people are reacting to is this incredible cultural shift.

“Based on public reports, your transition team and your potential cabinet include over twenty Wall Street elites, industry insiders, and lobbyists,” Warren wrote in a public letter to Trump on Tuesday, demanding that he drop lobbyists and Wall Street executives from his transition team and administration. “Should you refuse, I will oppose you, every step of the way, for the next four years. I will champion the millions of Americans you will fail to protect.”

Trump is not likely to heed any of Warren’s warnings, people close to the president-elect say. He derisively referred to the Massachusetts senator as “Pocahontas” and “goofy Elizabeth” on the campaign trail. And bankers believe Warren will be quickly sidelined. “You now have a president-elect who will absolutely delight in steamrolling her,” one Wall Street banker said this week.

There remains at least some hope among financial reformers that Trump will rediscover some of his anti-Wall Street zeal once he takes office. The GOP nominee intermittently criticized the banking industry during his campaign and spoke of a desire to reinstate the Glass-Steagall law separating retail and investment banking. And Bannon, despite making a fortune at Goldman, has spoken in the past about punishing bad banker behavior and simplifying the industry.

It’s a thin reed of hope for the left, given Trump’s early personnel moves, but progressives are clinging to it. “Candidate Trump understood the American people’s disgust with Washington’s bipartisan business-as-usual corruption, where the biggest corporations and Wall Street’s too-big-to-fail banks in particular buy access and influence to promote their special interests,” said Dennis Kelleher, CEO of Better Markets, a financial reform group. “That is the fetid swamp he was elected to drain.”

The left is also hoping that the U.S. can simply avoid another financial crisis before a less-Wall Street friendly administration wins the White House. “I think praying there is no financial meltdown before pro-regulatory forces return to power may be the least implausible path forward,” said Jeff Hauser, director of the Revolving Door Project.",www.politico.com,left,4lLmAY8YvJmVeaj6
banking_and_finance,Politico,0,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/27/mortgage-system-collapse-coronavirus-pandemic-152338,The next financial crisis: A collapse of the mortgage system,2020-03-27,"Heather Caygle, Sarah Ferris, Zachary Warmbrodt","Usually , a mortgage company can withstand a few borrowers failing to make payments , but the breadth of the coronavirus pandemic has sparked industry estimates of between 25 and 50 percent of borrowers being unable to pay .
That “ could threaten the ability of a mortgage servicer , particularly nonbank servicers , to remain a going concern , ” the Conference of State Bank Supervisors warned Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Mnuchin in a March 25 letter .
State regulators wanted to weigh in because “ our members are the primary regulators of the nonbank servicers , ” said Margaret Liu , CSBS senior vice president and deputy general counsel .
If 25 percent of borrowers fail to make their mortgage payments , the industry would need $ 40 billion to cover three months of payments , according to Jay Bray , CEO of the servicing company Mr. Cooper . Depending on how long the situation lasts , Broeksmit said demands on servicers “ could exceed $ 75 billion and could climb well above $ 100 billion . ”
And if mortgage companies fail across the board , “ the system breaks down , ” said Andrew Jakabovics , vice president for policy development at Enterprise Community Partners , an affordable housing nonprofit .
“ The kinds of relief we did during the foreclosure crisis — all of that had to do with the fact that we wanted to ensure that investors from across the world would continue to treat U.S. mortgage-backed securities as an incredibly safe investment , ” Jakabovics said . “ That would have very serious ramifications for the availability and price of mortgage credit . ”
Bright , who formerly managed the $ 2 trillion portfolio of government-run mortgage financier Ginnie Mae , said he believes the Fed will come through with an emergency lending program for the industry .
“ Even though that language wasn ’ t included [ in the Senate bill ] , I do think it ’ s likely that this could be part of [ the Fed ’ s Term Asset-Backed Loan Facility Program ] in the end , ” he said .
Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mark Calabria — who regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the two government-sponsored mortgage giants that prop up about half of the nation ’ s $ 11 trillion market — said this week in a Bloomberg TV interview that he was confident that large banks would continue to extend credit to mortgage servicers for the time being .
Still , he said , “ if we get to a situation where this goes longer than two months , absolutely there ’ s going to need to be a bigger solution . ”
Broeksmit said some mortgage companies won ’ t make it that long , depending on the share of loans in their portfolios located in areas of the country where the virus has hit particularly hard .
“ Some servicers will need the liquidity sooner than others , so we ’ re hoping that the facility will be set up immediately , ” Broeksmit said .
Liu also said the credit lines from banks wouldn ’ t be enough to keep the system afloat .
“ The mortgage market is one of the many multiple complexly interconnected pieces of our financial system , so those assurances are really important , but I think the role of the government in being a reliable and available source of credit for the mortgage market and mortgage servicers during a crisis is even more important , ” she said .
In the meantime , the industry is crossing its fingers that the individual cash relief in the Senate bill will lead to fewer people needing to request forbearance on their payments .
“ We ’ re hoping that the take-up rate won ’ t be too high and that the duration is not extended , but we have to prepare for both , ” Broeksmit said .","Usually, a mortgage company can withstand a few borrowers failing to make payments, but the breadth of the coronavirus pandemic has sparked industry estimates of between 25 and 50 percent of borrowers being unable to pay.

And if mortgage companies fail across the board, “the system breaks down,” said Andrew Jakabovics, vice president for policy development at Enterprise Community Partners, an affordable housing nonprofit.

“The kinds of relief we did during the foreclosure crisis — all of that had to do with the fact that we wanted to ensure that investors from across the world would continue to treat U.S. mortgage-backed securities as an incredibly safe investment,” Jakabovics said. “That would have very serious ramifications for the availability and price of mortgage credit.”

Bright, who formerly managed the $2 trillion portfolio of government-run mortgage financier Ginnie Mae, said he believes the Fed will come through with an emergency lending program for the industry.

“Even though that language wasn’t included [in the Senate bill], I do think it’s likely that this could be part of [the Fed’s Term Asset-Backed Loan Facility Program] in the end,” he said.

Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mark Calabria — who regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-sponsored mortgage giants that prop up about half of the nation’s $11 trillion market — said this week in a Bloomberg TV interview that he was confident that large banks would continue to extend credit to mortgage servicers for the time being.

Still, he said, “if we get to a situation where this goes longer than two months, absolutely there’s going to need to be a bigger solution.”

Broeksmit said some mortgage companies won’t make it that long, depending on the share of loans in their portfolios located in areas of the country where the virus has hit particularly hard.

“Some servicers will need the liquidity sooner than others, so we’re hoping that the facility will be set up immediately,” Broeksmit said.

Liu also said the credit lines from banks wouldn’t be enough to keep the system afloat.

“The mortgage market is one of the many multiple complexly interconnected pieces of our financial system, so those assurances are really important, but I think the role of the government in being a reliable and available source of credit for the mortgage market and mortgage servicers during a crisis is even more important,” she said.

In the meantime, the industry is crossing its fingers that the individual cash relief in the Senate bill will lead to fewer people needing to request forbearance on their payments.

“We’re hoping that the take-up rate won’t be too high and that the duration is not extended, but we have to prepare for both,” Broeksmit said.

Less than 24 hours after he wrote a conciliatory letter to creditors asking for a new bailout that would accept many of their terms , Tsipras abruptly switched back into combative mode in a television address .
Greece was being `` blackmailed , '' he said , quashing talk that he might delay the vote , call it off or urge Greeks to vote yes .
The remarks added to the frantic and at times surreal atmosphere of recent days in which acrimonious messages from the leftist government have alternated with late-night offers of concessions to restart negotiations .
A day after Greece became the first advanced economy to default on debt to the IMF , long lines at cash machines provided a stark visual symbol of the pressure on Tsipras , who came to power in January vowing to end austerity and protect the poor .
`` A 'No ' vote is a decisive step toward a better agreement that we aim to sign right after Sunday 's result , '' he said , rejecting repeated warnings from European partners that the referendum would effectively be a vote on whether Greece stays in the euro or returns to the drachma .
European Council President Donald Tusk retorted in a tweet : `` Europe wants to help Greece . But can not help anyone against their own will . Let 's wait for the results of the Greek referendum . ''
Euro zone finance ministers held an hour-long conference call to discuss the previous night 's offer from Tsipras , but were adamant that no further discussions would be held until after the Sunday vote . The head of the currency zone ministers ' Eurogroup , Jeroen Dijsselbloem , said he saw `` little chance '' of progress after Tsipras ' latest comments .
Global financial markets have reacted remarkably calmly to the widely anticipated Greek default , strengthening the hand of hardline euro zone partners who say Athens can not use the threat of contagion to weaker European sovereigns as a bargaining chip .
In his overnight letter to creditors , seen by Reuters , Tsipras agreed to accept most of their demands for taxes and pension cuts and asked for a new 29 billion euro ( $ 32.21 billion ) loan to cover all debt service payments in the next two years .
However even if negotiations do restart after the referendum , Germany and others made clear that any talks on a new program would have to start from scratch with different conditions .
The exasperated tone to public comments of European leaders exhausted by the chaotic turnarounds of the past few days offered little hope of a breakthrough .
Tsipras has suggested he would step aside if Greeks vote yes in Sunday 's referendum , and many other euro zone countries have made little secret that they see no point in negotiating with him before then .
`` This government has done nothing since it came into office , '' German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said in a speech in the lower house of parliament in which he accused Athens of repeatedly reneging on its commitments .
`` You ca n't in all honesty expect us to talk with them in a situation like this , '' he said .

An opinion poll showed opposition to the bailout in the lead but also that the gap had narrowed significantly as the bank closure and capital controls began to bite . But the hardship facing pensioners added to the pressure facing Tsipras , who has indicated he will resign if he loses the referendum .
Europe 's top human rights watchdog criticized the haste with which the vote had been arranged but posters from the ruling Syriza party calling for a `` No '' vote started to appear in central Athens . The center-right opposition also ran television spots mocking previous comments from the government that capital controls would never be imposed .
The Tsipras letter contained only a single sketchy reference to labor market reform , which was one of the creditors ' key demands to make the Greek economy more competitive , and no mention at all of frozen privatizations , another bugbear .
`` The new framework will be legislated in autumn 2015 , '' it said without saying what measures it contained . Tsipras ' leftist government wants to restore collective bargaining rights scrapped under previous bailout-driven reforms , and opposes a demand to make collective layoffs easier in the private sector .
Tsipras did agree to implement immediately a range of measures recommended by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to make it easier to do business and open up closed business sectors .
In the letter , he asked to keep a discount on value added tax for Greek islands , stretch out defense spending cuts and delay the phasing out of an income supplement to poorer pensioners .
European financial markets remained strikingly calm in the light of the upcoming referendum , the IMF default and heightened concerns about the risk of Athens sliding out the euro .
The lack of panic or contagion to other euro markets stood in marked contrast to 2011 , when the Greek crisis was perceived as a threat to the future of the single currency .
And this lack of overspill has emboldened the more hawkish of Greece 's sovereign creditors , including those in Berlin , who insist Greece had been effectively ringfenced by a host of financial buffers and its fate would not undermine the integrity of the euro in the same way it did four years ago .

PENSIONERS SUFFERING



On the third day of a bank closure, the costs of the capital controls were biting deeper, with long lines forming at many ATMs and limited amounts of cash being doled out to pensioners. Even with a withdrawal limit of only 60 euros a day, there were signs of banknote shortages, with bankers saying 50-euro and 20-euro notes were running low.



Kiki Rizopoulou, a 79 year-old pensioner from Lamia in central Greece had to travel to Athens to collect her pension, spending 20 euros of the 120 euros she was allowed to take out.



""I already have to pay back 50 euros that I owe. It's embarrassing,"" she said.

Investors are in the midst of a sell-off . The Chinese stock market 's troubles are leading to big questions about how much that country 's problems will be a drag on the rest of the global economy . The Dow Jones industrial average was down Monday nearly 600 points , or 3.5 percent .
So , what are average investors to do ? Nothing . Hang tight . At least that 's what most financial experts say .
But that advice is easier to give than to follow . When pushed off a cliff , one 's natural instinct is to grab for anything to stop the fall .
Within the past week , the Dow has fallen nearly 10 percent . Morgan Housel , a senior analyst with Motley Fool , says investors feel a similar impulse to stop the fall by selling off their stocks , despite the advice almost all analysts give : to accept — even embrace — the inevitable ups and downs of the market .

Investors are in the midst of a sell-off. The Chinese stock market's troubles are leading to big questions about how much that country's problems will be a drag on the rest of the global economy. The Dow Jones industrial average was down Monday nearly 600 points, or 3.5 percent.

So, what are average investors to do? Nothing. Hang tight. At least that's what most financial experts say.

But that advice is easier to give than to follow. When pushed off a cliff, one's natural instinct is to grab for anything to stop the fall.

Within the past week, the Dow has fallen nearly 10 percent. Morgan Housel, a senior analyst with Motley Fool, says investors feel a similar impulse to stop the fall by selling off their stocks, despite the advice almost all analysts give: to accept — even embrace — the inevitable ups and downs of the market.

Housel, who studies and writes about the behavioral psychology of markets, says volatility prevents dangerous feedback loops in the economy.

""If we never had crashes in the stock market, if there was no big volatility, there would be no risk,"" he says. ""And if there was no risk, then everybody would pile in at the same time and get a high return on your money. And if everyone did that at the same time, stocks would get really expensive, we'd have a bubble, and then they would crash.""

""Hang on, stay the course"" is a message most investment advisers repeat to their clients every time their portfolio takes a beating. And yet, Housel says, it's a lesson that never seems to stick.

""With 24/7 cable news, and Twitter, and stock updates on your iPhone, I think if anything that probably makes it a little bit worse; it increases the idea that we need to act now,"" the analyst says — while admitting that, as a member of the media himself, he might be part of the problem.

The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 3.29 % during the week ending March 5 , a major decrease of 16 basis points from the previous week , Freddie Mac FMCC , +6.03 % reported this week .
Previously , the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage hit an all-time low back in November 2012 in the wake of the recession , when the average rate fell to 3.31 % .
The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage also fell 16 basis points to 2.79 % , according to Freddie Mac . The 5/1 adjustable-rate mortgage dropped only two basis points to an average of 3.18 % .
The decline in rates presents a major windfall for millions of homeowners across the country , who stand to save thousands of dollars in interest by refinancing . Furthermore , an estimated 44.7 million homeowners have $ 6.2 trillion in home equity that they could access through a cash-out refinance , according to real-estate data firm Black Knight , and now they have the chance to access that cash at a lower interest rate .
“ The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to an all-time low of 3.29 % during the week ending March 5 . ”

While interest rates on home loans had followed Treasurys downward in recent weeks , the spread between the two had widened to an extent .

The decline in rates has stoked another refinancing boom , said Sam Khater , chief economist at Freddie Mac . “ Mortgage applications increased 10 % last week from one year ago and show no signs of slowing down , ” Khater said in the report .
Those who are considering refinancing shouldn ’ t wait on the sidelines , since it ’ s not guaranteed mortgage rates will drop much further than where they are now . Many lenders have hit their capacity in terms of how many loans they can process . While lenders have boosted hiring in response to this increased demand , they are worried about being caught flat-footed with excess staff when rates eventually move back up . “ They don ’ t know how persistent these rates will be , ” said Tendayi Kapfidze , chief economist at LendingTree TREE , +1.92 % .
An emerging risk that those looking to refinance may want to consider is the possibility of government orders to shelter in place amid the coronavirus outbreak . “ Are they actually going to be able to get people to their loan processing centers ? ” Kapfidze said . “ Some of the work can be done remotely . But that might actually create friction in the system . ”
Home buyers may be hard pressed to take advantage of low rates
As low rates have been a boon to those looking to refinance , it has also greased the wheels for would-be home buyers .

In recent months , the inventory of homes for sale has an hit all-time low amid the high demand from buyers . The low inventory is largely the result of depressed home construction activity in the wake of the recession , which did not keep pace with household formation across the country . Many single-family homes were also purchased by investors during the bust years and converted into rentals , further constricting supply .
While home-building activity has ramped up since last summer , it is not occurring as such a pace that it could meet the demand in the market .

“ So if it spreads further , even if we don ’ t get any coronavirus , you can expect a slowing down of trade between countries and an impact on our stock market , ” Hufbauer added .
Flights were halted between China and major countries during the 2003 SARS epidemic , he noted . But if the coronavirus doesn ’ t spread in the same way , it won ’ t have a major impact on the economy , Hufbauer said .
“ It would be more like a blip in that case , ” he said .
The World Health Organization has decided against declaring the outbreak a global emergency for now . Such a declaration can bring more money and other resources to fight a threat but can also trigger economically damaging restrictions on trade and travel in the affected countries .
The decision “ should not be taken as a sign that WHO does not think the situation is serious or that we ’ re not taking it seriously . Nothing could be further from the truth , ” WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said . “ WHO is following this outbreak every minute of every day . ”
On Tuesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that a U.S. citizen who recently returned to Washington State from a trip to central China was diagnosed with the virus .
Some economists , like Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics , don ’ t anticipate a major impact on the economy .
“ The new Wuhan coronavirus has apparently already spread to the US — with a first case reported in Washington State — but we don ’ t expect it to cause the sort of panic that hit travel and retail sales in affected areas during the SARS epidemic in 2003 , principally because the mortality rate for this new virus appears to be much lower than SARS , ” Ashworth wrote .
The coronavirus ’ 3 % mortality rate so far compares to SARS ’ 15 % mortality rate , according to WHO .
Jeffrey Kleintop of Charles Schwab also downplayed the potential economic impact from the coronavirus .
“ The emergence of a lethal and rapidly spreading pandemic could lead to terrible human suffering , ” he tweeted . “ However , the impact of past world pandemics on the economy and market has not been significant — even when the global economy was especially vulnerable to a shock . ”
“ # CoronavirusScare costs are mounting , especially in China , with closures and airlines impacted by a drop in travel , ” Kleintop added . “ SARS was estimated to have cost $ 33 billion by the World Bank . That may seem like a lot , but the seasonal flu costs an annual $ 11 billion in the US alone each year . ”

Some economists, like Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics, don’t anticipate a major impact on the economy.

“The new Wuhan coronavirus has apparently already spread to the US — with a first case reported in Washington State — but we don’t expect it to cause the sort of panic that hit travel and retail sales in affected areas during the SARS epidemic in 2003, principally because the mortality rate for this new virus appears to be much lower than SARS,” Ashworth wrote.

The coronavirus’ 3% mortality rate so far compares to SARS’ 15% mortality rate, according to WHO.

Jeffrey Kleintop of Charles Schwab also downplayed the potential economic impact from the coronavirus.

“The emergence of a lethal and rapidly spreading pandemic could lead to terrible human suffering,” he tweeted. “However, the impact of past world pandemics on the economy and market has not been significant — even when the global economy was especially vulnerable to a shock.”

“#CoronavirusScare costs are mounting, especially in China, with closures and airlines impacted by a drop in travel,” Kleintop added. “SARS was estimated to have cost $33 billion by the World Bank. That may seem like a lot, but the seasonal flu costs an annual $11 billion in the US alone each year.”

U.S. stocks fell Thursday morning but recovered with S&P and Nasdaq in the green.

China tries to stem the bleeding

Some sort of bounce was anticipated on Tuesday due to the enormous losses that have been inflicted on the markets even though the American economy doesn't appear to be falling off a cliff. All three major U.S. equity indexes had plunged into correction territory -- their first 10% decline from recent highs since 2011.

Global markets cheer China's emergency move

Investors around the world cheered China's emergency actions in hopes they will at least stabilize conditions in Asia. European stocks surged 4% higher, with Germany's DAX rallying nearly 5% just a day after falling into a bear market.

The significant market moves underscore how much China matters to the global markets. China is the world's second-biggest economy and its explosive growth over the past two decades helped lift many other countries. That's especially true for emerging markets like Brazil that rely on China's huge demand for its natural resources.

That's why the turbulence in China's stock market has unnerved so many investors. The Shanghai Composite plunged another 7.6% on Tuesday in a selloff that occurred prior to the interest rate cut. The bubble in Chinese stocks has burst, leaving the Shanghai index down a whopping 42% since June 12.

But U.S. economy isn't tanking

Many market veterans believe the damage done by the selloff in the U.S. was overdone considering the American economy doesn't appear to be tanking at this point. Unlike the market turmoil in 2008, the economy isn't on track for a recession.

Not only does the jobs market look healthy, but the housing industry continues to recover and cheap oil is creating a huge windfall for consumers at the pump.

""I still think this pullback is a buying opportunity. I still have confidence in the U.S. economy,"" said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.

Shares are mostly lower in Asia on Tuesday after Wall Street suffered its worst session in two years , with the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumping more than 1,000 points on fears that a viral outbreak that began in China will weaken the world economy .
Japan ’ s Nikkei 225 index lost 3 % , to 22,686.61 after it reopened from a holiday on Monday . Hong Kong ’ s Hang Seng edged 0.2 % lower to 26,777.88 and the Shanghai Composite index sank 1.6 % to 2,984.19 . In Australia , the S & P ASX/200 shed 1.2 % to 6,896.10 .
South Korea ’ s Kospi rebounded from a steep loss on Monday , adding 0.6 % to 2,091.80 . Shares also rose in Singapore but fell elsewhere in the region .
In Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia ’ s main benchmark dropped 2.7 % amid a political upheaval after Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad offered his resignation to Malaysia ’ s king while his political party quit the ruling alliance .
Overnight on Wall Street , traders sought safety in U.S. government bonds , gold and high-dividend stocks like utilities and real estate . The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to the lowest level in more than three years .
Technology companies , whose supply chains have been disrupted , accounted for much of the broad market slide , which wiped out all of the Dow ’ s and S & P 500 ’ s gains for the year .
More than 79,000 people worldwide have been infected by the new coronavirus . China , where the virus originated , still has the majority of cases and deaths . The country ’ s economy has been hardest hit as businesses and factories sit idle and people remain home-bound because the government has severely restricted travel and imposed strict quarantine measures to stop the virus from spreading . Economists have cut growth estimates for the Chinese economy .
The ripple effects of the outbreak are being felt all around the world , as China is both a major importer of goods and a source of parts for intricate supply chains .
China ’ s government promised tax cuts and other aid Monday to help companies recover despite anti-disease controls that shut down much of the world ’ s second-largest economy last month . Economists say it is likely to be at least mid-March before automakers and other companies return to full production .
Still , while concern about the virus has prompted some sporadic selling in the past few weeks , for the most part global markets have traded as if the virus ’ impact would be limited . Until Monday , the major U.S. stock indexes had all been in the green .
Crude oil prices slid 3.7 % on Monday but were stable early Tuesday . Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 26 cents to $ 51.69 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange .

The slump in U.S. indexes followed a sell-off in markets overseas .

More than 79,000 people worldwide have been infected by the new coronavirus. China, where the virus originated, still has the majority of cases and deaths.

New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo , a Democrat , whose state has become an epicenter of the COVID-19 crisis , said Wednesday that more than 6,000 mental-health professionals had volunteered to provide free mental-health services .
The Empire State had at least 60,000 confirmed cases as of Monday morning , up from 37,258 just four days ago , making up a disproportionate share of the United States ’ 143,055 confirmed cases . New York City accounts for 776 of the 2,513 deaths from the disease in the U.S .
“ Some 35 % of Americans say their mental health has worsened over the past week , an increase over 22 % a week earlier . ”
“ Don ’ t underestimate the emotional trauma that people are feeling , ” Cuomo said . The COVID-19 pandemic is , after all , a life or death situation , he added . New Yorkers can call a hotline at 1-844-863-9314 to schedule an appointment , he said .
Some 35 % of Americans say their mental health has worsened over the past week , an increase over 22 % a week earlier , according to recent findings from the Axios/Ipsos Coronavirus Index . Forty-three percent said their emotional well-being had gotten worse , compared to 29 % a week earlier .
Americans ’ top worries related to coronavirus include that they or a family member will get sick from COVID-19 ( 62 % ) , a negative impact on investments such as retirement or college savings ( 51 % ) , and lost income due to reduced hours or workplace closure ( 46 % ) , according to a separate poll published last week by the Kaiser Family Foundation .
Among workers , 53 % say they ’ re worried they ’ ll lose income due to workplace closure or reduced hours , and 41 % worry they ’ ll risk exposure to coronavirus because they can ’ t afford to miss work , the Kaiser poll found .
“ Social distancing is ‘ actually physical distancing. ’ ‘ Socially , we can remain even closer. ’ ” — Christine Moutier , the chief medical officer of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention
The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline “ has not experienced significant changes in call volume at this time , ” spokesperson Frances Gonzalez told ███ , though representatives from some crisis and suicide-prevention hotlines have reported increased call volumes in recent days .
While the shared experience of navigating a pandemic can help individuals connect with one another , “ it also is going to be different for different people , so that can create its own challenges , ” said Christine Moutier , the chief medical officer of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention .
A variety of stressors , including job loss , poor health , self-isolation and quarantine , and general anxiety and uncertainty , could negatively impact mental health . Some people may also be struggling with existing conditions such as substance-use disorders or depression .
But “ people are resilient , ” said Vaile Wright , a clinical psychologist and researcher at the American Psychological Association . “ We can adapt , ” she said . “ We can get through this . ”
Normalize any intense uncomfortable emotions you ’ re having right now , said Joan Cook , a clinical psychologist and Yale School of Medicine associate professor who studies traumatic stress . Don ’ t judge yourself if you feel mild anxiety or depression , loneliness , boredom , frustration or anger . This is an unprecedented time for all of us , she said , and “ there are a lot of unknowns . ”
“ While it ’ s important to ground ourselves by remembering to ‘ count our blessings ’ and be grateful for our lives and any privileges we have , it is equally important for us to acknowledge that social distancing , quarantine or isolation is hard , ” Cook said . “ And know that you are not alone in finding the consequences of social distancing , like losing our jobs or being physically distanced from family and friends , also very difficult . ”
Give yourself credit if you are following the social-distancing directives of federal , state and local health officials , Cook added . “ It ’ s important that we give ourselves the recognition when we do a good job , ” she said . “ You ’ re reducing the possibility of transmitting the virus , and protecting those who are most vulnerable . ”
You may be out of a job or working from home , but you still need to mind your basic human needs . Establish a routine , Wright said : Get enough sleep , get dressed in the morning , take a shower and eat a healthy diet . Exercise , she added , even if it ’ s just by going outside for fresh air . Build structure into an otherwise loose day by scheduling all of these needs , Moutier said .
“ Mental health is not only critically important to pay attention to during COVID-19 for its own sake , ” Moutier added , “ but because the brain is connected to the body , how well we ’ re managing our mental health will directly affect our physical health — for example , things even like the strength of our immune system . ”
Stay in connected with friends and family through phone calls , text messages , FaceTime AAPL , -1.43 % video calls and social media . “ We all need to put in extra effort right now , ” Wright said . If you are struggling with tough emotions , reach out to the most trustworthy person in your life to share how you ’ re feeling , Moutier said ; that simple act could be a game changer .
Laughter and play are “ critically necessary ” during this time , Moutier added . Moments of humor might be harder to come by right now , but try to prioritize them .
If you lack an existing social-support system , “ now is the time to go out and find connection with others , even if you don ’ t know who they are , ” Wright said . Seek out online support groups or social-media communities related to your interests . After all , social distancing is actually physical distancing , Moutier said . “ Socially , we can remain even closer . ”
Stay informed about the pandemic , especially at your local level , but try to get off your devices too , Wright said . “ Find the bit of the news that either empowers you or doesn ’ t drive up your anxiety , ” she said . Wright , for example , has found that TV pundits and Twitter TWTR , +0.30 % tend to make her more anxious . “ Absolutely do not read the news or check stuff before going to sleep , ” she added .
The federal government has expanded access to telemedicine in response to COVID-19 , as have some states . “ If you are in therapy or mental-health treatment , make sure that you continue it and ask your provider specifically if they ’ re providing video chat or telehealth , ” Moutier said .
If you believe your mental health is deteriorating , seek help . “ There ’ s evidence that shows that telehealth can be as effective as in-person treatment in many instances , ” she said . The present situation “ could be a tipping point for not just acceptance for telehealth , but also removing the barriers to it around reimbursement and access , ” Wright said .
Look for an app that has scientific backing , as well as mental or behavioral-health experts who served as subject-matter experts , Wright said . Understand the app ’ s privacy policy and where your data might go , and look through the reviews . Experts praise the Department of Veteran Affairs ’ line of health apps , which includes apps for PTSD coping and mood boosting .
Is your anxious mind racing at 100 miles per hour ? Theresa Nguyen , the chief program officer for the nonprofit Mental Health America , suggested the mental-heath technique of grounding . “ Grounding is a technique to use your five senses and just bring your attention to the present moment , ” she said . “ It ’ s very effective , because your mind can only think about one thing at a time . ”
If you ’ re gardening , for example , put your hand in the soil and just focus on that . Touch whatever is around you or try reciting a mantra to yourself , and remember to breathe deeply . We sometimes hold our breath when we are anxious or working hard , which can also exacerbate our anxiety , mental-health professionals say .
Engage in activities you know will help you feel healthy and centered , Moutier said , whether it ’ s exercise like yoga , walking or running , or hobbies like reading , crafting or music . Relax yourself with deep breathing exercises . “ Not everyone is a nature person , but there is a fairly common experience that being in nature is grounding in and of itself , ” she added .
“ One hundred percent , if you ’ re in crisis , call a hotline , ” Wright said .

A variety of stressors, including job loss, poor health, self-isolation and quarantine, and general anxiety and uncertainty, could negatively impact mental health. Some people may also be struggling with existing conditions such as substance-use disorders or depression.

But “people are resilient,” said Vaile Wright, a clinical psychologist and researcher at the American Psychological Association. “We can adapt,” she said. “We can get through this.”

Here are some strategies for coping:

Be kind to yourself

Normalize any intense uncomfortable emotions you’re having right now, said Joan Cook, a clinical psychologist and Yale School of Medicine associate professor who studies traumatic stress. Don’t judge yourself if you feel mild anxiety or depression, loneliness, boredom, frustration or anger. This is an unprecedented time for all of us, she said, and “there are a lot of unknowns.”

“While it’s important to ground ourselves by remembering to ‘count our blessings’ and be grateful for our lives and any privileges we have, it is equally important for us to acknowledge that social distancing, quarantine or isolation is hard,” Cook said. “And know that you are not alone in finding the consequences of social distancing, like losing our jobs or being physically distanced from family and friends, also very difficult.”

Give yourself credit if you are following the social-distancing directives of federal, state and local health officials, Cook added. “It’s important that we give ourselves the recognition when we do a good job,” she said. “You’re reducing the possibility of transmitting the virus, and protecting those who are most vulnerable.”

Address your physical health

You may be out of a job or working from home, but you still need to mind your basic human needs. Establish a routine, Wright said: Get enough sleep, get dressed in the morning, take a shower and eat a healthy diet. Exercise, she added, even if it’s just by going outside for fresh air. Build structure into an otherwise loose day by scheduling all of these needs, Moutier said.

“Mental health is not only critically important to pay attention to during COVID-19 for its own sake,” Moutier added, “but because the brain is connected to the body, how well we’re managing our mental health will directly affect our physical health — for example, things even like the strength of our immune system.”

Connect with friends, family and/or online communities

Stay in connected with friends and family through phone calls, text messages, FaceTime AAPL, -1.43% video calls and social media. “We all need to put in extra effort right now,” Wright said. If you are struggling with tough emotions, reach out to the most trustworthy person in your life to share how you’re feeling, Moutier said; that simple act could be a game changer.

Laughter and play are “critically necessary” during this time, Moutier added. Moments of humor might be harder to come by right now, but try to prioritize them.

If you lack an existing social-support system, “now is the time to go out and find connection with others, even if you don’t know who they are,” Wright said. Seek out online support groups or social-media communities related to your interests. After all, social distancing is actually physical distancing, Moutier said. “Socially, we can remain even closer.”

Consume news wisely

Stay informed about the pandemic, especially at your local level, but try to get off your devices too, Wright said. “Find the bit of the news that either empowers you or doesn’t drive up your anxiety,” she said. Wright, for example, has found that TV pundits and Twitter TWTR, +0.30% tend to make her more anxious. “Absolutely do not read the news or check stuff before going to sleep,” she added.

Take advantage of telehealth services

The federal government has expanded access to telemedicine in response to COVID-19, as have some states. “If you are in therapy or mental-health treatment, make sure that you continue it and ask your provider specifically if they’re providing video chat or telehealth,” Moutier said.

If you believe your mental health is deteriorating, seek help. “There’s evidence that shows that telehealth can be as effective as in-person treatment in many instances,” she said. The present situation “could be a tipping point for not just acceptance for telehealth, but also removing the barriers to it around reimbursement and access,” Wright said.

Try a mental-health app

Look for an app that has scientific backing, as well as mental or behavioral-health experts who served as subject-matter experts, Wright said. Understand the app’s privacy policy and where your data might go, and look through the reviews. Experts praise the Department of Veteran Affairs’ line of health apps, which includes apps for PTSD coping and mood boosting.

Ground yourself

Is your anxious mind racing at 100 miles per hour? Theresa Nguyen, the chief program officer for the nonprofit Mental Health America, suggested the mental-heath technique of grounding. “Grounding is a technique to use your five senses and just bring your attention to the present moment,” she said. “It’s very effective, because your mind can only think about one thing at a time.”

If you’re gardening, for example, put your hand in the soil and just focus on that. Touch whatever is around you or try reciting a mantra to yourself, and remember to breathe deeply. We sometimes hold our breath when we are anxious or working hard, which can also exacerbate our anxiety, mental-health professionals say.

Engage in activities you know will help you feel healthy and centered, Moutier said, whether it’s exercise like yoga, walking or running, or hobbies like reading, crafting or music. Relax yourself with deep breathing exercises. “Not everyone is a nature person, but there is a fairly common experience that being in nature is grounding in and of itself,” she added.

Tap into crisis hotlines

“One hundred percent, if you’re in crisis, call a hotline,” Wright said. To access coronavirus-related crisis counseling from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) Disaster Distress Helpline, call 1-800-985-5990 or text “TalkWithUs” to 66746. You can also reach the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255, the Crisis Text Line by texting “HOME” to 741741, and the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233.

To reduce that feeling of existential dread...

Take each day as it comes. Much about the future of the pandemic remains unknown, and it’s easy to feel a sense of impending doom. Try to shorten the time frame of your perspective, Nguyen said: “If you find yourself going to, ‘What if the world is going to end?’ you want to bring it back a little closer to, ‘What am I going to do in two days, what am I going to do today, what does it look like right now?’”",www.marketwatch.com,right,4cfcVBvmFtymd8WX

Does Big Money know something you do n't ?
Think about it : Voting starts in the New Hampshire primary today , and the self-described democratic socialist is arguably now in the best position to win the Democratic presidential nomination . Head-to-head polls consistently show him defeating President Trump . A Quinnipiac poll out yesterday has Sanders beating Trump by a comfortable eight points .
And yet the stock market keeps climbing . The S & P 500 is up nearly 15 percent over the past six months , gains that come after an already lengthy bull market run . Stocks barreled right though that Quinnipiac poll when it was released .

If you're a fervent Bernie Sanders supporter who thinks America is finally ready for a political and economic revolution, take a breath and consider: Why isn't Bernie's steady rise totally freaking out Wall Street? Does Big Money know something you don't?

Think about it: Voting starts in the New Hampshire primary today, and the self-described democratic socialist is arguably now in the best position to win the Democratic presidential nomination. Head-to-head polls consistently show him defeating President Trump. A Quinnipiac poll out yesterday has Sanders beating Trump by a comfortable eight points.

And yet the stock market keeps climbing. The S&P 500 is up nearly 15 percent over the past six months, gains that come after an already lengthy bull market run. Stocks barreled right though that Quinnipiac poll when it was released.

Pity those poor, oblivious bankers, right? Spare a single pang of sympathy for them. Don't they know the Bernie Bros are coming for their loot? The early days of the Sanders presidency may not be exactly like those scenes in The Dark Knight Rises when the populist mob drags wealthy Gothamites from their Upper East Side apartments. But once Bernie's big wealth taxes hit and he smashes the megabanks, life in Manhattan might feel pretty different to the private equity guys and hedgies.

Of course, that's not how Big Money sees things playing out. ""A whopping 80-90 percent of participants at our client conferences thought that President Trump would win re-election in November,"" Goldman Sachs noted in a recent report. With the unemployment rate at a half-century low and economic confidence at a 20-year high, it seems inconceivable to many investors that voters wouldn't return Trump to office. For this crowd, prediction markets are as important, if not more so, than polling. And they show Trump as the favorite over the Democrats, with the exception of Mike Bloomberg. And nobody on Wall Street is going to panic if the next president is a guy who got rich selling data and software to Wall Street.

So folks keep on investing. Four more years of Trump means four more years of an overall business-friendly economic agenda of low taxes and light regulation.

Here’s how.,2020-04-20,Allan Sloan,"Now , let me back up a bit and explain what I ’ m talking about .
It involves making an unconventional use of the federal Strategic Petroleum Reserve to take advantage of the big gap between the current and future prices of U.S. crude oil .
Current prices are way down because demand has collapsed as a result of the covid-19 pandemic and because there is so much surplus oil sloshing around that there ’ s little storage capacity available to hold any new oil that gets produced .
However , the Strategic Petroleum Reserve — which we ’ ll call SPR from now on — had 78.5 million barrels of spare capacity available as of April 10 , the most recent data available . That ’ s a lot of spare capacity — and it has the potential to turn a quick , nifty profit for taxpayers .
Had the federal government been able to act in a financially astute way last week , it could have bought 78.5 million barrels of crude oil for the SPR at Friday ’ s price of $ 18.27 on the New York Mercantile Exchange and simultaneously gotten $ 33.82 by agreeing to deliver that same amount of oil in December . That $ 15.55 per barrel difference would have let the government sell the oil for $ 1.22 billion more than the SPR would have paid for it .
Given the huge plunge in oil prices as I write this Monday morning , the profit would be about half a billion dollars higher .
Why didn ’ t the government use the SPR to make some money , which also would have propped up oil prices and held down future oil prices ? And why am I talking about a potential $ 860 million windfall ( at Friday ’ s prices ) rather than a potential $ 1.22 billion windfall ?
First , because arbitraging oil by simultaneously buying and selling it is a Wall Street way of thinking , not a federal government way of thinking .
Second , because in the last stimulus package , Congress refused to grant the Energy Department the money it sought to buy oil for the SPR . So the SPR couldn ’ t have bought the oil and I don ’ t think it has the authority to sell oil in the futures market . At least , it hasn ’ t done so since it was founded in 1975 .
In theory , President Trump could have issued yet another of his “ emergency ” decrees to order the SPR to simultaneously buy and sell oil . But he didn ’ t .
I figure that ’ s probably because the unconventional idea of using our strategic oil reserve to make money by simultaneously buying and selling oil hadn ’ t occurred to his advisers .
Now , let me tell you why I think oil companies rather than taxpayers will profit from the SPR ’ s spare storage capacity if something isn ’ t done — quickly — by Trump , Congress or both .
I ’ m talking about a potential $ 860 million taxpayer windfall ( at Friday ’ s prices ) rather than a potential $ 1.22 billion windfall because the Trump administration has ordered the SPR to store 23 million barrels of oil for hard-pressed oil companies .
Subtract those 23 million barrels from the SPR ’ s spare capacity and it falls to 55.5 million barrels . Assume the same $ 15.55 per barrel spread we discussed earlier ( based on Friday ’ s numbers ) and the potential profit is $ 863 million .
The Energy Department declined to say how big the storage fee is — it takes the form of the SPR returning less oil to the companies than they deposited in the caverns where the reserves are held . The department also declined to say for how long it would store the oil .
The one thing we can be sure of , though , is that the companies depositing the oil and then getting most of it back will turn a tidy profit that could otherwise have gone to the taxpayers .
That ’ s because June oil futures were selling Friday for 34 percent more than the then-current price , July futures were 57 percent higher , and the numbers kept climbing from there . That spread is doubtless way more than the rent rate that the SPR will get .
I can understand why some people oppose anything that helps increase oil production , which is reportedly the reason that the Energy Department ’ s request for money to buy oil for the SPR didn ’ t make it into the recent stimulus legislation .
But let ’ s get real . If the SPR isn ’ t given the authority to simultaneously buy and sell oil to earn a profit , that profit is going to go to oil companies .
That ’ s because Trump has the authority to order the SPR to store oil for producers , and there ’ s no reason to think that he won ’ t commit essentially all the reserve ’ s spare capacity to do that .
And unless the rent the SPR charges is exorbitant — which I ’ m sure it won ’ t be — oil producers will end up with profits that taxpayers could have gotten . I ’ d rather that taxpayers profit from the SPR , which was established at taxpayer expense , than for oil companies to profit from it .
Sure , even a billion or 2 billion bucks is a drop in the bucket compared with the looming budget deficits . But it ’ s a lot more than nothing . Which is what we taxpayers will end up with unless someone deals with the problem .","Now, let me back up a bit and explain what I’m talking about.

What’s happening

Paying rent on the first day of the month can be a daunting challenge for many in the United States even in normal times. The economic impacts brought on by the coronavirus pandemic have turned that ongoing concern into a potential crisis. Stay-at-home orders have shuttered businesses, causing an unprecedented spike in unemployment.

Without money coming in, millions of Americans are struggling to pay their bills. Nearly a third of renters failed to pay on time in April. As the outbreak continues, the number of people who cannot make rent is likely to increase.

Lawmakers have taken some steps to address the problem. Many states have imposed temporary bans on evictions, meaning people can’t lose their homes for missing rent payments. The $2.2 trillion stimulus bill passed by Congress included mortgage relief provisions that could allow landlords to offer tenants a break on rent.

These steps, while welcome, aren’t nearly enough to avoid a national rental crisis, housing advocates say. The only way to prevent millions of people from losing their homes in the coming months, they argue, is for rent to be canceled for the 44 million rental households in the U.S., as long as the economy is closed.

Why there’s debate

Supporters of a rent freeze say it’s unfair to expect renters to keep up with payments when lockdown orders prevent many from earning an income. Banning evictions helps for now but may lead to a mass wave of evictions when the bans are lifted and rental debt becomes due, housing experts say. The costs of having millions of newly unhoused people relying on government assistance and unable to socially distance would be far greater than the expense of canceling rent, advocates argue.

Plans for rent cancelation call for the government to cover rental costs either by paying landlords directly or by compelling banks to offer landlords mortgage relief. One estimate suggests this would cost roughly $66 billion a month — though that number could be reduced significantly by targeting relief to landlords who own a small number of properties or who rent to low-income tenants. A formal rent cancelation policy would help protect landlords from the chaos that could ensue when tenants suddenly cannot pay or if they coordinate to hold a rent strike.

Opponents of a rental freeze say it would deny landlords of income they need to pay their own expenses. If a property owner goes into foreclosure because of unpaid rent, their tenants will likely lose their homes as well, some argue. That possibility of that pattern repeating at a national scale raises fears that rent cancelation could lead to a mortgage crisis similar to the one that caused the 2008 financial collapse.

Programs like unemployment insurance, payroll tax relief and direct cash payments are a more effective way to help struggling renters than a rent freeze, some argue.

What’s next

The idea of a rent freeze has gained popularity, but there’s limited support among lawmakers currently. Rent strikes are expected at the beginning of May in several parts of the country, including high-cost areas like New York and California.

Perspectives

Freezing rent would prevent a catastrophic surge in evictions

“This would be a bailout for people — for the countless families already facing difficulties making their next rent payment and who soon will face the real prospect of eviction. If we do not act now, people will lose their access to housing. The social impact of evictions on individuals, families and communities will be brutal.” — Gianpaolo Baiocchi and H. Jacob Carlson, New York Times

It’s better to boost other benefits without passing risks along to landlords

“Many tenants will be cushioned by unemployment benefits and stimulus checks. Politicians who want to help them even more shouldn’t do so at the expense of another struggling group.” — editorial, New York Post

It’s unfair to ask people to keep up with bills when they’re unable to work

If the state ’ s severance tax had not been phased out , companies would have paid an estimated $ 3 billion during the same period . Instead , cities and counties collected less than a third of that amount , or roughly $ 871 million .
Polk County , home to Falls City , has lost approximately $ 29 million in revenue from timber sales on federal land . By comparison , the elimination of the severance tax and lower property taxes for private timber companies have cost the county at least $ 100 million .

The profits are concentrated with a small number of companies controlled by real estate trusts , investment funds and wealthy timber families . Small timber owners , who grow forests that are older and more biologically diverse than what corporate owners manage , have sold off hundreds of thousands of acres .
In western Oregon , at least 40 % of private forestlands are now owned by investment companies that maximize profits by purchasing large swaths of forestland , cutting trees on a more rapid cycle than decades ago , exporting additional timber overseas instead of using local workers to mill them and then selling the properties after they ’ ve been logged .
Such intensive timber farming contributes to global warming because younger trees don ’ t store carbon dioxide as well as older ones . It also relies heavily on the use of herbicides and fertilizers , magnifies drought conditions and degrades habitat for wildlife such as threatened salmon and native songbirds .

From a distance , tree plantations can be confused for natural forests . Oregon vistas still boast hundreds of thousands of acres of green treetops . But , on the ground , plantations of trees crammed together are often eerily barren , devoid of lush vegetation and wildlife .
Former Oregon Gov . John Kitzhaber said that he and his advisers were alarmed by the shift toward investor-driven forestry during his last of three terms in office .

From his favorite spot on a hill near Falls City , Ed Friedow can see what he refers to as the big picture : the Oregon coast , rolling hills , a national forest and industrial lands now managed mostly by timber investment companies .
Friedow , a logger who grew up on a farm outside of town , watched as smaller timber companies from his childhood closed in the aftermath of the spotted owl protections , leaving control of the industry with larger companies that were more equipped to scale production .
“ All of a sudden , it was just like a takeover situation , ” Friedow said .
At the same time the changes were happening in Oregon , the timber industry was emerging from a nationwide recession that caused widespread bankruptcies in the 1980s . Many debt-laden companies began selling off forestlands . Meanwhile , changes in the federal tax code made timber an attractive investment that wouldn ’ t crash with the stock market .
Under federal tax law , pension funds and other investors can acquire forestlands without paying the corporate taxes incurred by traditional timber companies that mill their own products . Those corporate taxes have reached 35 % . Investors in the company instead pay a capital gains tax closer to 15 % .
In the 1990s , as federal logging plummeted , timber prices skyrocketed , making those investments look even smarter , said Brooks Mendell , president of the forest investment consultancy Forisk .
“ Overnight , private landowners had something that became more valuable , ” Mendell said .
Federal Payments to Oregon ’ s Western Counties Dropped Precipitously Lylla Younes/███ ; Source : Headwaters Economics
Investors jumped at the opportunity to own timber , and existing companies like Weyerhaeuser restructured to take advantage of the tax breaks . The longtime Seattle-based timber company converted into a real estate investment trust in 2010 .
Timber investment companies , a rarity in the 1990s , now control a share of the forestland in western Oregon roughly the size of Delaware and Rhode Island combined .
Weyerhaeuser , the largest of such companies , has more than doubled its size in western Oregon over the past 15 years , the investigation by the three news organizations found . The company owns more than 1.5 million of western Oregon ’ s 6.5 million acres of private forestland .

Despite its growth , Weyerhaeuser employs fewer people than it did two decades ago and has shed most of its mill operations . It has three wood products facilities in Oregon and directly employs about 950 people , fewer than a quarter of the 4,000 employees the company listed in a 2006 news release . The decrease stems from factors that include consolidation and automation of jobs in mills .
Just outside of Falls City , Weyerhaeuser owns roughly 21,000 acres . The company controls the road into the forest that leads to public lands and the land surrounding the creeks that supply the town ’ s drinking water . In 2006 , the city temporarily shut down its water treatment plant because it was clogged with muddy runoff from logging operations .
Weyerhaeuser spokesman Karl Wirsing said the company remains a good partner to local communities . In the past five years , the company has donated nearly $ 1.6 million across the state , including $ 10,000 to the Falls City Fire Department and $ 16,000 to the Polk County sheriff to help fund a new position that also patrols private forestlands .
“ We don ’ t simply do business in Oregon ; our people have been living and working across the state since 1902 , and we are proud of our role supporting local communities and economies , ” Wirsing said in an emailed statement .
Industrial clear-cuts , where thousands of trees are leveled at once , are a common sight in Oregon ’ s rainy coastal mountains . ( Beth Nakamura/The Oregonian )
But not all communities describe the relationship as a beneficial partnership .
Corthell , the city manager in Falls City , said it took him nearly two years of phone calls and emails before Weyerhaeuser responded to his requests for help .
The stretch of road between the forest and the town is cracked like a jigsaw puzzle .
Corthell had hoped that the timber companies that use the road every day could pitch in to help pay for the $ 200,000 in needed repairs . But he said he didn ’ t get a meeting with them until after he suggested the road might close if it weren ’ t repaired .
At that meeting in March , representatives for Weyerhaeuser and a few other timber companies told Corthell that they were willing to provide matching funds if the town could secure a state grant . In response to questions about Weyerhaeuser ’ s delay in returning Corthell ’ s emails and calls , Wirsing said the company had previously been willing to contribute to the road project but the town never asked for a specific dollar amount .
Corthell is now preparing the town ’ s grant application . If the funding doesn ’ t come through , he doesn ’ t know where he ’ ll find the money .
Penelope Kaczmarek , 65 , spent her childhood smelling freshly cut wood at the family mill and the sulfury wafts of the distant pulp mill through her kitchen window in the coastal fishing town of Newport more than an hour southwest of Falls City .
She watched floating logs await their turn at her father ’ s saw blade , mesmerized as men in hickory shirts , sawn-off jeans and hard hats rolled them across the water .
Kaczmarek ’ s father , W. Stan Ouderkirk , was a logger , small mill owner and Republican member of the Oregon House of Representatives in the 1960s and 1970s . He represented Lincoln County , home to the Siuslaw National Forest and a vibrant commercial fishing port .
When a large , out-of-state corporation bought his mill in the mid-1970s , Ouderkirk told his daughter that a rise of corporate ownership and loss of local control would lead to worse outcomes for Oregon ’ s forests and the people who depended on them .
Lincoln County lost an estimated $ 108 million in timber payments after the federal government restricted logging on public lands . But the sharp drop in federal forestland revenue is only partly to blame for budget cuts that have led some counties to force-release inmates from jail or reduce sheriffs patrols to the point that 911 calls for break-ins and assaults went unanswered .
Tax cuts for large timber companies that log on private lands cost the county an estimated $ 122 million over the same period .
Before lawmakers began chipping away at the tax through multiple measures , Lincoln County collected an average of $ 7.5 million a year in severance taxes . Last year , the county received just under $ 25,000 .
Now a psychiatric social worker , Kaczmarek sees people with mental illnesses filling local jails because the county doesn ’ t have the money to provide adequate health services . In therapy sessions , teachers tell her about overcrowded classrooms and school programs cut to the bare minimum . County leaders blame the majority of the financial struggles on the decline in revenue from logging .

To avoid crushing cuts in services , communities that already struggle with high poverty and unemployment rates have had to raise taxes on residents and small businesses , said Jaime McGovern , an economist with the state ’ s Legislative Revenue Office .
“ If they don ’ t get approved , then there ’ s no money there , ” McGovern said . “ And so , you ’ ve seen libraries closing , police stations closing . ”
In the Marcola School District , about 15 miles northeast of Eugene , the elementary school was so dilapidated that voters in 2015 passed a bond to build a new one .
The additional funding helped , but it wasn ’ t enough . The new elementary school is already bursting with students .
“ That hits home because I volunteer at the school district and I care about my taxes , ” Helen Kennedy , a retired attorney , said . “ I care about the kids . ”
Helen Kennedy , who lives in Marcola , Oregon , pays nearly 100 times the tax rate of Weyerhaeuser , the largest timber investment company in Oregon . ( Beth Nakamura/The Oregonian )
Kennedy , who lives on 3.5 acres in the district , saw her property taxes increase by more than 20 % after she voted for the bond . Last year , Kennedy paid $ 1,443 in property taxes , or about $ 412 per acre . That ’ s a fraction of what she ’ d pay in a city like Portland , but nearly 100 times the rate of the district ’ s biggest landowner .
Weyerhaeuser , which owns more than 49,000 acres in the district , paid about $ 226,000 in property taxes last year , according to county records . That amounts to about $ 4.60 per acre . At the rate Kennedy ’ s land is taxed , the company would have had to pay an additional $ 20 million .
“ Holy cannoli , ” Kennedy , 64 , said about the losses from timber tax cuts . “ The old adage that ‘ what is good for the timber industry is good for Oregon ’ is no longer true . ”
Radtke , a member of a gubernatorial task force on timber taxes , sat in a hotel conference room near the state capitol in 1999 listening to lobbyists and timber executives argue that their industry was being unfairly taxed .
In the early 1990s , as Oregon voters passed reforms to limit their property taxes , large timber companies successfully lobbied to gradually cut the severance tax in half , lowering their own bills by $ 30 million a year .
But now they wanted to completely eliminate the severance tax .
Timber companies argued that since they ’ d already cut nearly all of the existing forests on their land , and state law required them to plant new trees , they were essentially farmers . And since Oregon didn ’ t tax crops , it shouldn ’ t tax trees .
As the owner of 100 acres of forestland , Radtke could have personally benefited from the tax cut . But as an economist advising Kitzhaber , the governor at the time , he knew it would devastate rural communities .
Hans Radtke , a member of a gubernatorial task force on timber taxes , opposed the elimination of the severance tax , which would devastate rural communities . ( Beth Nakamura/The Oregonian )
After several failed attempts to offer changes that would lower industry taxes but avoid eliminating the severance tax altogether , Radtke knew the cut would pass . He turned to the industry lobbyist sitting next to him and said , “ You ’ re fucking us . ”
The task force dissolved without advancing any recommendations . Months later , Lane Shetterly , a former Republican state representative whose district included Falls City , introduced a bill at the request of the timber industry to phase out the severance tax .
The bill contained an increase in forestland property taxes that many believed would lessen the impact of the cut .
The Association of Oregon Counties supported it . The school lobby didn ’ t fight it . The governor signed it .
Revenue From Severance Tax Payments to Oregon ’ s Western Counties Has All but Vanished Lylla Younes/███ ; Source : Oregon Department of Revenue
Shetterly , now president of the Oregon Environmental Council , one of the state ’ s top environmental groups , remembers almost nothing about the bill .
“ Yeah , man that ’ s a long time ago , ” Shetterly said in a phone interview .
Kitzhaber , who vetoed an earlier version before ultimately approving the measure , also doesn ’ t recall his support of the tax cut .
“ I don ’ t question that I did , ” Kitzhaber said , “ but I can ’ t remember the context . ”
Two decades later , Oregonians are still picking up the tab .
If Oregon hadn ’ t phased out its severance tax , timber production in 2018 would have generated an estimated $ 130 million .
The state would have received an estimated $ 59 million under California ’ s tax system and $ 91 million under Washington ’ s system , the investigation by OPB , The Oregonian/OregonLive and ███ found .
Unlike Oregon , those states still tax large timber companies for the value of the trees they log .
Timber companies continue to pay state taxes that apply to all Oregon businesses , including income taxes and lowered property taxes , kept far below market value as an incentive for residents to own forestland .
Machinery logs forestland owned by Weyerhaeuser outside Falls City . ( Beth Nakamura/The Oregonian )
The companies also pay a flat fee on the volume of logs they harvest . That fee , set in part by a board of timber company representatives , generates about $ 14 million annually . It funds state forestry agencies and university research instead of local governments .
Linc Cannon , former director of taxation for the Oregon Forest & Industries Council , defends the elimination of the severance tax .
In many cases , Cannon said , counties didn ’ t lose as much money because they simply shifted the tax burden to residents and small businesses .
Cannon said timber is a crop and should be treated like one . States that tax timber differently are simply wrong , he said .
“ If you don ’ t believe timber is a crop , then you can tax it in other ways like Washington does , ” Cannon said .
Weyerhaeuser , a major timber company , owns this land outside Falls City , Oregon . Forests once existed here . Douglas fir trees grew for hundreds of years . Now , it ’ s a tree plantation , managed for profit .
A wisp of smoke from a burning pile of logging debris swirled into the fog drift above the jagged hills behind Falls City , home to some of the nation ’ s most productive timberlands .
At each bend in the rocky logging road , Jerry Franklin ’ s voice rose . Oregon has become a case study for what can happen when state leaders fail to regulate the logging style practiced by investment companies , said Franklin , who is one of the Pacific Northwest ’ s best-known forest scientists .
“ This is not stewardship , ” Franklin said , pointing to clear-cuts down to skinny stumps , sprayed over with herbicides , dessicated brown plants and streams without a single tree along the banks . “ This is exploitation . ”
Franklin doesn ’ t object to logging . He and Norm Johnson , another forest scientist with whom he works closely , have drawn the ire of environmental groups for supporting more logging on federal lands , including certain types of clear-cutting .
Forest scientists Norm Johnson , left , and Jerry Franklin stand in the Valley of the Giants , an ancient forest in the Coast Range . ( Beth Nakamura/The Oregonian )
Douglas fir trees , which can live for centuries , are cut after only about 40 years , resulting in lower-quality wood that is worth less . The shorter timetable forces cutting across more acres to produce the same volume , but fewer workers to log and process the wood .
At 83 , Franklin is older than most of the Douglas firs now growing in Oregon .
“ They ’ re wasting it , ” Franklin said , his tone matching that of a Sunday preacher , as he looked at clear-cut Weyerhaeuser land . “ The incredible capacity of these forests to produce incredible volumes of high-quality wood is wasted . It ’ s criminal . ”
In reports to investors , Weyerhaeuser says the average age of a tree cut in the Pacific Northwest is 50 , but the company expects a decrease . Some older trees have yet to be logged because of regulations that limit the percentage that can be cut annually , the company states in reports .
Weyerhaeuser representatives said the company ’ s conversion to a real estate investment trust didn ’ t change its management of forestlands .
“ We have been practicing and continually improving on this system of sustainable forest management for generations , and we will continue to do so in Oregon — and on all our timberlands — for generations to come , ” Wirsing said .

Oregon is suffering from the side effects of short-term logging practiced by companies that don ’ t plan to stay around long , said Steven Kadas , who until two years ago was chief forester for the smaller , locally owned company Thompson Timber .
When trees are cut down before reaching the peak of their ability to absorb carbon , it stunts one of the state ’ s biggest assets in combating climate change . The use of herbicide on clear-cuts and the lack of mature trees have deteriorated habitat for native songbirds on industrial private lands . Streams for salmon , for other fish and for drinking are drying up because young forests use more water and lose more of it to evaporation .
“ You ’ re not going to see the results of what you do , ” Kadas said . “ You ’ re not going to have to live with those . ”

But the roads to those destinations are often behind locked gates during peak summer tourism months because of the timber companies that own them .
The companies restricting access say they are worried about vandalism and wildfires , but $ 250 a year can buy you a permit to camp or collect firewood on Weyerhaeuser lands . Hancock , the other major investment company that owns property near the town , opened part of its lands for recreational access during non-wildfire months after receiving $ 350,000 in grants from the state . Falls City leaders are seeking more grant funding to open up the road to the Valley of the Giants .
“ I just don ’ t think that ’ s something that would sit well in the stomachs of most Oregonians , ” Corthell , the city manager , said . “ To know that there ’ s a town right here that ’ s suffering for lack of ability to support itself in many ways and that we have this giant asset right up the road that we can ’ t get to because the big corporations have control over it . ”

FALLS CITY, Ore. — A few hundred feet past this Oregon timber town, a curtain of Douglas fir trees opens to an expanse of skinny stumps.

The hillside has been clear-cut, with thousands of trees leveled at once. Around the bend is another clear-cut nearly twice its size, then another, patches of desert brown carved into the forest for miles.

Logging is booming around Falls City, a town of about 1,000 residents in the Oregon Coast Range. More trees are cut in the county today than decades ago when a sawmill hummed on Main Street and timber workers and their families filled the now-closed cafes, grocery stores and shops selling home appliances, sporting goods and feed for livestock.

Listen to the Story Wall Street investment funds took control of Oregon’s private forests. Now, wealthy timber corporations reap the benefits of tax cuts that have cost rural counties billions.

But the jobs and services have dried up, and the town is going broke. The library closed two years ago. And as many as half of the families in Falls City live on weekly food deliveries from the Mountain Gospel Fellowship.

“You’re left still with these companies that have reaped these benefits, but those small cities that have supported them over the years are left in the dust,” Mac Corthell, the city manager, said.

For decades, politicians, suit-and-tie timber executives and caulk-booted tree fallers alike have blamed the federal government and urban environmental advocates for kneecapping the state’s most important industry.

Timber sales plummeted in the 1990s after the federal government dramatically reduced logging in national forests in response to protests and lawsuits to protect the northern spotted owl under the Endangered Species Act and other conservation laws. The drop left thousands of Oregonians without jobs, and counties lost hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenue.

But the singularly focused narrative, the only one most Oregonians know, masked another devastating shift for towns like Falls City.

Wall Street real estate trusts and investment funds began gaining control over the state’s private forestlands. They profited at the expense of rural communities by logging more aggressively with fewer environmental protections than in neighboring states, while reaping the benefits of timber tax cuts that have cost counties at least $3 billion in the past three decades, an investigation by OPB, The Oregonian/OregonLive and ProPublica found.

Half of the 18 counties in Oregon’s timber-dominant region lost more money from tax cuts on private forests than from the reduction of logging on federal lands, the investigation shows.

Private timber owners used to pay what was known as a severance tax, which was based on the value of the trees they logged. But the tax, which helped fund schools and local governments, was eliminated for all but the smallest timber owners, who can choose to pay it as a means to further reduce annual property taxes.

The total value of timber logged on private lands since 1991 is approximately $67 billion when adjusted for inflation, according to an analysis of data from Oregon’s Department of Forestry. If the state’s severance tax had not been phased out, companies would have paid an estimated $3 billion during the same period. Instead, cities and counties collected less than a third of that amount, or roughly $871 million.

Polk County, home to Falls City, has lost approximately $29 million in revenue from timber sales on federal land. By comparison, the elimination of the severance tax and lower property taxes for private timber companies have cost the county at least $100 million.

“You have that tension between this industry that still employs people, but we’re losing some of the benefits of that relationship,” Falls City Mayor Jeremy Gordon said. “As those jobs diminish, there’s less and less support to subsidize that industry in the community.”

“A Completely Different Business Model”

Oregon’s connection to the timber industry is so tightly knit that casinos, high school mascots and coffee roasters take their names from mills, loggers and stumps. The state Capitol is domed by a golden pioneer carrying an ax, and its House chamber carpeting is adorned with trees. The mascot of the Portland Timbers, a Major League Soccer team, is a logger who revs a chainsaw and cuts a round off a Douglas fir tree after every home goal.

While the industry today still rakes in billions of dollars annually, it’s starkly different from the one that helped build and enrich the state.

Oregon lowered taxes and maintained weaker environmental protections on private forestlands than neighboring states in exchange for jobs and economic investment from the timber industry.

Despite such concessions, the country’s top lumber-producing state has fewer forest-sector jobs per acre and collects a smaller share of logging profits than Washington or California.

If Oregon taxed timber owners the same as its neighbors, which are also top lumber producers with many of the same companies, it would generate tens of millions of dollars more for local governments.

Timber once employed 1 in every 10 working Oregonians and pumped over $120 million per year into schools and county governments through severance and property taxes. Now, it employs 1 in every 50 working residents and pays about $25 million in severance and property taxes that go directly back to communities.

The profits are concentrated with a small number of companies controlled by real estate trusts, investment funds and wealthy timber families. Small timber owners, who grow forests that are older and more biologically diverse than what corporate owners manage, have sold off hundreds of thousands of acres.

In western Oregon, at least 40% of private forestlands are now owned by investment companies that maximize profits by purchasing large swaths of forestland, cutting trees on a more rapid cycle than decades ago, exporting additional timber overseas instead of using local workers to mill them and then selling the properties after they’ve been logged.

Such intensive timber farming contributes to global warming because younger trees don’t store carbon dioxide as well as older ones. It also relies heavily on the use of herbicides and fertilizers, magnifies drought conditions and degrades habitat for wildlife such as threatened salmon and native songbirds.

Jerry Anderson, region manager for Hancock Forest Management, one of the largest timber investment companies in Oregon, said local leadership makes decisions about the best practices for the land despite responsibilities to investors.

“There’s nobody from outside this area that has come in and told us what to do on these individual plantations. Those are local decisions,” said Anderson, who has been managing land in Polk County under various companies for the past 40 years. The last eight years have been with Hancock. “I think our decision-making is very measured.”

From a distance, tree plantations can be confused for natural forests. Oregon vistas still boast hundreds of thousands of acres of green treetops. But, on the ground, plantations of trees crammed together are often eerily barren, devoid of lush vegetation and wildlife.

Former Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber said that he and his advisers were alarmed by the shift toward investor-driven forestry during his last of three terms in office. By then, forest ecologists, the U.S. Forest Service and even a former chief investment officer for Hancock had published papers warning that investor-driven forestry was ecologically damaging and less capable of sustaining rural communities.

“They have a completely different business model,” Kitzhaber, a Democrat, said.

Kitzhaber, who received nearly $200,000 in contributions from timber-connected donors while in office, supported multiple industry-backed measures during his tenure. He led a plan to save Oregon’s salmon that relied on voluntary measures from timber companies instead of regulations, and he signed into law a massive tax cut for the industry that’s still felt in many counties.

“The current state isn’t working,” Kitzhaber said in an interview. It may benefit investors, he said, “but it’s not working for small mill owners. It’s not working for rural communities. They don’t have any control of their future.”

A Forest Town Surrounded by Corporate Trees

From his favorite spot on a hill near Falls City, Ed Friedow can see what he refers to as the big picture: the Oregon coast, rolling hills, a national forest and industrial lands now managed mostly by timber investment companies.

Friedow, a logger who grew up on a farm outside of town, watched as smaller timber companies from his childhood closed in the aftermath of the spotted owl protections, leaving control of the industry with larger companies that were more equipped to scale production.

“All of a sudden, it was just like a takeover situation,” Friedow said.

At the same time the changes were happening in Oregon, the timber industry was emerging from a nationwide recession that caused widespread bankruptcies in the 1980s. Many debt-laden companies began selling off forestlands. Meanwhile, changes in the federal tax code made timber an attractive investment that wouldn’t crash with the stock market.

Under federal tax law, pension funds and other investors can acquire forestlands without paying the corporate taxes incurred by traditional timber companies that mill their own products. Those corporate taxes have reached 35%. Investors in the company instead pay a capital gains tax closer to 15%.

In the 1990s, as federal logging plummeted, timber prices skyrocketed, making those investments look even smarter, said Brooks Mendell, president of the forest investment consultancy Forisk.

“Overnight, private landowners had something that became more valuable,” Mendell said.

Investors jumped at the opportunity to own timber, and existing companies like Weyerhaeuser restructured to take advantage of the tax breaks. The longtime Seattle-based timber company converted into a real estate investment trust in 2010.

Timber investment companies, a rarity in the 1990s, now control a share of the forestland in western Oregon roughly the size of Delaware and Rhode Island combined.

Weyerhaeuser, the largest of such companies, has more than doubled its size in western Oregon over the past 15 years, the investigation by the three news organizations found. The company owns more than 1.5 million of western Oregon’s 6.5 million acres of private forestland.

Despite its growth, Weyerhaeuser employs fewer people than it did two decades ago and has shed most of its mill operations. It has three wood products facilities in Oregon and directly employs about 950 people, fewer than a quarter of the 4,000 employees the company listed in a 2006 news release. The decrease stems from factors that include consolidation and automation of jobs in mills.

Just outside of Falls City, Weyerhaeuser owns roughly 21,000 acres. The company controls the road into the forest that leads to public lands and the land surrounding the creeks that supply the town’s drinking water. In 2006, the city temporarily shut down its water treatment plant because it was clogged with muddy runoff from logging operations.

Weyerhaeuser spokesman Karl Wirsing said the company remains a good partner to local communities. In the past five years, the company has donated nearly $1.6 million across the state, including $10,000 to the Falls City Fire Department and $16,000 to the Polk County sheriff to help fund a new position that also patrols private forestlands.

“We don’t simply do business in Oregon; our people have been living and working across the state since 1902, and we are proud of our role supporting local communities and economies,” Wirsing said in an emailed statement.

But not all communities describe the relationship as a beneficial partnership.

Corthell, the city manager in Falls City, said it took him nearly two years of phone calls and emails before Weyerhaeuser responded to his requests for help.

The stretch of road between the forest and the town is cracked like a jigsaw puzzle.

Corthell had hoped that the timber companies that use the road every day could pitch in to help pay for the $200,000 in needed repairs. But he said he didn’t get a meeting with them until after he suggested the road might close if it weren’t repaired.

At that meeting in March, representatives for Weyerhaeuser and a few other timber companies told Corthell that they were willing to provide matching funds if the town could secure a state grant. In response to questions about Weyerhaeuser’s delay in returning Corthell’s emails and calls, Wirsing said the company had previously been willing to contribute to the road project but the town never asked for a specific dollar amount.

Corthell is now preparing the town’s grant application. If the funding doesn’t come through, he doesn’t know where he’ll find the money.

“I Fear My Father Was Right”

Penelope Kaczmarek, 65, spent her childhood smelling freshly cut wood at the family mill and the sulfury wafts of the distant pulp mill through her kitchen window in the coastal fishing town of Newport more than an hour southwest of Falls City.

She watched floating logs await their turn at her father’s saw blade, mesmerized as men in hickory shirts, sawn-off jeans and hard hats rolled them across the water.

Kaczmarek’s father, W. Stan Ouderkirk, was a logger, small mill owner and Republican member of the Oregon House of Representatives in the 1960s and 1970s. He represented Lincoln County, home to the Siuslaw National Forest and a vibrant commercial fishing port.

When a large, out-of-state corporation bought his mill in the mid-1970s, Ouderkirk told his daughter that a rise of corporate ownership and loss of local control would lead to worse outcomes for Oregon’s forests and the people who depended on them.

“I fear my father was right,” Kaczmarek said.

Lincoln County lost an estimated $108 million in timber payments after the federal government restricted logging on public lands. But the sharp drop in federal forestland revenue is only partly to blame for budget cuts that have led some counties to force-release inmates from jail or reduce sheriffs patrols to the point that 911 calls for break-ins and assaults went unanswered.

Tax cuts for large timber companies that log on private lands cost the county an estimated $122 million over the same period.

Before lawmakers began chipping away at the tax through multiple measures, Lincoln County collected an average of $7.5 million a year in severance taxes. Last year, the county received just under $25,000.

Now a psychiatric social worker, Kaczmarek sees people with mental illnesses filling local jails because the county doesn’t have the money to provide adequate health services. In therapy sessions, teachers tell her about overcrowded classrooms and school programs cut to the bare minimum. County leaders blame the majority of the financial struggles on the decline in revenue from logging.

To avoid crushing cuts in services, communities that already struggle with high poverty and unemployment rates have had to raise taxes on residents and small businesses, said Jaime McGovern, an economist with the state’s Legislative Revenue Office.

“If they don’t get approved, then there’s no money there,” McGovern said. “And so, you’ve seen libraries closing, police stations closing.”

In the Marcola School District, about 15 miles northeast of Eugene, the elementary school was so dilapidated that voters in 2015 passed a bond to build a new one.

The additional funding helped, but it wasn’t enough. The new elementary school is already bursting with students.

“That hits home because I volunteer at the school district and I care about my taxes,” Helen Kennedy, a retired attorney, said. “I care about the kids.”

Kennedy, who lives on 3.5 acres in the district, saw her property taxes increase by more than 20% after she voted for the bond. Last year, Kennedy paid $1,443 in property taxes, or about $412 per acre. That’s a fraction of what she’d pay in a city like Portland, but nearly 100 times the rate of the district’s biggest landowner.

Weyerhaeuser, which owns more than 49,000 acres in the district, paid about $226,000 in property taxes last year, according to county records. That amounts to about $4.60 per acre. At the rate Kennedy’s land is taxed, the company would have had to pay an additional $20 million.

“Holy cannoli,” Kennedy, 64, said about the losses from timber tax cuts. “The old adage that ‘what is good for the timber industry is good for Oregon’ is no longer true.”

The Billion-Dollar Tax Cut Almost Nobody Remembers

Hans Radtke knew the loss for counties was coming.

Radtke, a member of a gubernatorial task force on timber taxes, sat in a hotel conference room near the state capitol in 1999 listening to lobbyists and timber executives argue that their industry was being unfairly taxed.

In the early 1990s, as Oregon voters passed reforms to limit their property taxes, large timber companies successfully lobbied to gradually cut the severance tax in half, lowering their own bills by $30 million a year.

But now they wanted to completely eliminate the severance tax.

Timber companies argued that since they’d already cut nearly all of the existing forests on their land, and state law required them to plant new trees, they were essentially farmers. And since Oregon didn’t tax crops, it shouldn’t tax trees.

As the owner of 100 acres of forestland, Radtke could have personally benefited from the tax cut. But as an economist advising Kitzhaber, the governor at the time, he knew it would devastate rural communities.

After several failed attempts to offer changes that would lower industry taxes but avoid eliminating the severance tax altogether, Radtke knew the cut would pass. He turned to the industry lobbyist sitting next to him and said, “You’re fucking us.”

“And he just smiled,” Radtke said.

The task force dissolved without advancing any recommendations. Months later, Lane Shetterly, a former Republican state representative whose district included Falls City, introduced a bill at the request of the timber industry to phase out the severance tax.

The bill contained an increase in forestland property taxes that many believed would lessen the impact of the cut.

The Association of Oregon Counties supported it. The school lobby didn’t fight it. The governor signed it.

Shetterly, now president of the Oregon Environmental Council, one of the state’s top environmental groups, remembers almost nothing about the bill.

“Yeah, man that’s a long time ago,” Shetterly said in a phone interview.

Kitzhaber, who vetoed an earlier version before ultimately approving the measure, also doesn’t recall his support of the tax cut.

“I don’t question that I did,” Kitzhaber said, “but I can’t remember the context.”

Two decades later, Oregonians are still picking up the tab.

If Oregon hadn’t phased out its severance tax, timber production in 2018 would have generated an estimated $130 million.

The state would have received an estimated $59 million under California’s tax system and $91 million under Washington’s system, the investigation by OPB, The Oregonian/OregonLive and ProPublica found.

Unlike Oregon, those states still tax large timber companies for the value of the trees they log.

Timber companies continue to pay state taxes that apply to all Oregon businesses, including income taxes and lowered property taxes, kept far below market value as an incentive for residents to own forestland.

The companies also pay a flat fee on the volume of logs they harvest. That fee, set in part by a board of timber company representatives, generates about $14 million annually. It funds state forestry agencies and university research instead of local governments.

Linc Cannon, former director of taxation for the Oregon Forest & Industries Council, defends the elimination of the severance tax.

In many cases, Cannon said, counties didn’t lose as much money because they simply shifted the tax burden to residents and small businesses.

Cannon said timber is a crop and should be treated like one. States that tax timber differently are simply wrong, he said.

“If you don’t believe timber is a crop, then you can tax it in other ways like Washington does,” Cannon said.

Weyerhaeuser, a major timber company, owns this land outside Falls City, Oregon. Forests once existed here. Douglas fir trees grew for hundreds of years. Now, it’s a tree plantation, managed for profit.

“This Is Exploitation”

A wisp of smoke from a burning pile of logging debris swirled into the fog drift above the jagged hills behind Falls City, home to some of the nation’s most productive timberlands.

At each bend in the rocky logging road, Jerry Franklin’s voice rose. Oregon has become a case study for what can happen when state leaders fail to regulate the logging style practiced by investment companies, said Franklin, who is one of the Pacific Northwest’s best-known forest scientists.

“This is not stewardship,” Franklin said, pointing to clear-cuts down to skinny stumps, sprayed over with herbicides, dessicated brown plants and streams without a single tree along the banks. “This is exploitation.”

Franklin doesn’t object to logging. He and Norm Johnson, another forest scientist with whom he works closely, have drawn the ire of environmental groups for supporting more logging on federal lands, including certain types of clear-cutting.

But this, Franklin said, is different.

Douglas fir trees, which can live for centuries, are cut after only about 40 years, resulting in lower-quality wood that is worth less. The shorter timetable forces cutting across more acres to produce the same volume, but fewer workers to log and process the wood.

At 83, Franklin is older than most of the Douglas firs now growing in Oregon.

“They’re wasting it,” Franklin said, his tone matching that of a Sunday preacher, as he looked at clear-cut Weyerhaeuser land. “The incredible capacity of these forests to produce incredible volumes of high-quality wood is wasted. It’s criminal.”

In reports to investors, Weyerhaeuser says the average age of a tree cut in the Pacific Northwest is 50, but the company expects a decrease. Some older trees have yet to be logged because of regulations that limit the percentage that can be cut annually, the company states in reports.

Weyerhaeuser representatives said the company’s conversion to a real estate investment trust didn’t change its management of forestlands.

“We have been practicing and continually improving on this system of sustainable forest management for generations, and we will continue to do so in Oregon — and on all our timberlands — for generations to come,” Wirsing said.

Oregon is suffering from the side effects of short-term logging practiced by companies that don’t plan to stay around long, said Steven Kadas, who until two years ago was chief forester for the smaller, locally owned company Thompson Timber.

When trees are cut down before reaching the peak of their ability to absorb carbon, it stunts one of the state’s biggest assets in combating climate change. The use of herbicide on clear-cuts and the lack of mature trees have deteriorated habitat for native songbirds on industrial private lands. Streams for salmon, for other fish and for drinking are drying up because young forests use more water and lose more of it to evaporation.

“You’re not going to see the results of what you do,” Kadas said. “You’re not going to have to live with those.”

A New Economy Behind Locked Gates

Falls City’s mayor stands in the empty lot that once housed the town’s mill, imagining a two-story brewpub, its rooftop seating filled with locals and tourists on a summer evening.

Just up the hill, brush and bramble have overtaken a rusted chain link fence. Dirty yellow paint peels off a “dead end” sign dangling upside down.

But Gordon envisions a waterfront park fit for Instagram, complete with a footbridge across the namesake falls on the Little Luckiamute River.

“Falls City — end of the road. Start of your adventure,” Gordon said. It’s a slogan the town adopted this year as a way to jump-start its economy.

The town is the gateway to the Valley of the Giants, a 51-acre federal forest preserve with an iconic grove of trees as big as redwoods, draped in soggy neon moss. On the way is the ghost town of Valsetz. Then, the scenic Oregon coast.

But the roads to those destinations are often behind locked gates during peak summer tourism months because of the timber companies that own them.

The companies restricting access say they are worried about vandalism and wildfires, but $250 a year can buy you a permit to camp or collect firewood on Weyerhaeuser lands. Hancock, the other major investment company that owns property near the town, opened part of its lands for recreational access during non-wildfire months after receiving $350,000 in grants from the state. Falls City leaders are seeking more grant funding to open up the road to the Valley of the Giants.

“I just don’t think that’s something that would sit well in the stomachs of most Oregonians,” Corthell, the city manager, said. “To know that there’s a town right here that’s suffering for lack of ability to support itself in many ways and that we have this giant asset right up the road that we can’t get to because the big corporations have control over it.”

A few times a year, Friedow, the local logger, acts as a guide for tours to the Valley of the Giants.

He stops at the concrete slabs that remain of Valsetz, telling stories of the now-defunct mill town. Then he begins the more than hourlong drive to the grove with trees older than the founding of the United States.

Friedow doesn’t get far out of town before hearing from shocked tourists.

The Fox News host Bill Hemmer responded that it `` would be a great American resurrection . ''
In a second interview with Fox News later on Tuesday , when Trump was asked by Hemmer how he came up with Easter as the date for easing coronavirus restrictions , the president said , `` Easter is a very special day for me . ''
`` Would n't it be great to have all the churches full ? '' Trump added . `` You 'll have packed churches all over our country . I think it 'll be a beautiful time . ''
At the moment , churches across the US have moved services online due to coronavirus and calls for social distancing .

So as we 've always said , we 've got to try very much to stay ahead of the curve . ''
Shortly before the Fox News town hall , Gov . Andrew Cuomo of New York implored Trump not to risk endangering lives by rushing to reopen the economy .
Trump on Monday said the US was not meant to be `` shut down , '' adding , `` We are going to be opening up our country for business because our country was meant to be open . ''
Cuomo said he was sympathetic to the economic consequences of keeping nonessential businesses closed but added : `` If you ask the American people to choose between public health and the economy , then it 's no contest . No American is going to say , 'Accelerate the economy at the cost of human life . ' Because no American is going to say how much a life is worth . ''
Earlier Tuesday , the World Health Organization said the US could become the new epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic , citing a `` very large acceleration '' in infections . The US had fewer than 100 confirmed coronavirus cases on March 1 , but by Tuesday afternoon it had nearly 50,000 .
On March 16 , the White House announced new guidelines aimed at slowing the spread of the virus , including avoiding gatherings of 10 or more people , canceling nonessential travel , and not going out to bars and restaurants . The Trump administration said the guidelines would be in place for 15 days and then reassessed .
`` It 's important for the young and healthy people to understand that while they may experience mild symptoms , they can easily spread this virus , and they will spread it indeed , putting countless others in harm 's way , '' Trump said at the time .
Later in the week , Trump declared himself a `` wartime president '' and said the US was on `` wartime footing . '' But the president has since signaled that he 's growing impatient with the stringent measures to fight the pandemic that have essentially shut down major US cities and dealt a huge blow to the economy .
The president on Tuesday suggested that more people could die by suicide because of stress and anxiety about the economy than would die from COVID-19 , the illness caused by the coronavirus .
`` You 're going to lose more people by putting a country into a massive recession or depression , '' Trump said . `` You 're going to lose people . You 're going to have suicides by the thousands . You 're going to have all sorts of things happen . ''

President Donald Trump on Tuesday signaled that he wanted to ease up on coronavirus-related restrictions in a matter of weeks, even as his top experts say it could take months for life to go back to normal.

""I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter,"" Trump said during a Fox News town-hall event at the White House. Easter is on April 12, in 19 days.

The Fox News host Bill Hemmer responded that it ""would be a great American resurrection.""

In a second interview with Fox News later on Tuesday, when Trump was asked by Hemmer how he came up with Easter as the date for easing coronavirus restrictions, the president said, ""Easter is a very special day for me.""

""Wouldn't it be great to have all the churches full?"" Trump added. ""You'll have packed churches all over our country. I think it'll be a beautiful time.""

At the moment, churches across the US have moved services online due to coronavirus and calls for social distancing.

Trump's call to reopen the US economy goes against what his own experts have said, as well as warnings from governors on the front lines of the pandemic.

""I cannot see that all of a sudden, next week or two weeks from now, it's going to be over. I don't think there's a chance of that,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the US's top expert on infectious diseases, said on Friday.

""I think we should do everything we possibly can do,"" Fauci added. ""I mean, in all sectors, because obviously, as I've said so many times, when you think you're maybe overreacting, you probably are not acting as forcefully as you should. So as we've always said, we've got to try very much to stay ahead of the curve.""

Shortly before the Fox News town hall, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York implored Trump not to risk endangering lives by rushing to reopen the economy.

Trump on Monday said the US was not meant to be ""shut down,"" adding, ""We are going to be opening up our country for business because our country was meant to be open.""

Cuomo said he was sympathetic to the economic consequences of keeping nonessential businesses closed but added: ""If you ask the American people to choose between public health and the economy, then it's no contest. No American is going to say, 'Accelerate the economy at the cost of human life.' Because no American is going to say how much a life is worth.""

Earlier Tuesday, the World Health Organization said the US could become the new epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, citing a ""very large acceleration"" in infections. The US had fewer than 100 confirmed coronavirus cases on March 1, but by Tuesday afternoon it had nearly 50,000.

On March 16, the White House announced new guidelines aimed at slowing the spread of the virus, including avoiding gatherings of 10 or more people, canceling nonessential travel, and not going out to bars and restaurants. The Trump administration said the guidelines would be in place for 15 days and then reassessed.

""It's important for the young and healthy people to understand that while they may experience mild symptoms, they can easily spread this virus, and they will spread it indeed, putting countless others in harm's way,"" Trump said at the time.

Later in the week, Trump declared himself a ""wartime president"" and said the US was on ""wartime footing."" But the president has since signaled that he's growing impatient with the stringent measures to fight the pandemic that have essentially shut down major US cities and dealt a huge blow to the economy.

The president on Tuesday suggested that more people could die by suicide because of stress and anxiety about the economy than would die from COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus.

""You're going to lose more people by putting a country into a massive recession or depression,"" Trump said. ""You're going to lose people. You're going to have suicides by the thousands. You're going to have all sorts of things happen.""

Though Trump says he wants to reopen the economy, he has limited power to do so due to the 10th amendment. In other words, these decisions will largely occur at the state level and be made by governors, not the president.",www.businessinsider.com,center,3HuJ287WDLgXTt38

The answer lies in the nature of this rollback , along with the real lack of communication between lawmakers ostensibly on the same side .
First of all , it ’ s worth mentioning that the CRomnibus was a horrible bill even without weakening Dodd-Frank . It was loaded with favors to wealthy and well-connected special interests , and its very existence , as a must-pass , short-term budget bill larded up with unrelated policy riders that will last forever , sets a dangerous precedent for the future .
But let ’ s just focus on this one Wall Street rider , and how it made its way into law .
The so-called swaps push-out provision of Dodd-Frank , Section 716 , forced commercial banks that trade certain risky types of derivatives to split them off into a separately capitalized subsidiary , uncovered by FDIC deposit insurance . Those attempting to downplay Section 716 ’ s importance , like Paul Krugman , highlight the fact that uninsured institutions like Lehman Brothers played a critical role in the last crisis , and that risk can cascade through an interconnected financial system no matter where those risks are initially housed . This theory actually made it easier to get the rider through Congress , giving lawmakers a plausible story that the provision wasn ’ t central to reform .
But this overlooks how 716 didn ’ t just limit taxpayer bailouts , but removed a lucrative subsidy for the four major banks – Citigroup , JPMorgan Chase , Bank of America and Goldman Sachs – that control almost all of the derivatives market . By holding derivatives inside their depository units , these banks benefit from an implicit FDIC guarantee for its counter-parties should those units fail . Keeping them in separately capitalized entities costs the banks more in short-term borrowing . As the Wall Street Journal ’ s John Carney points out , the banks ’ parent companies have lower credit ratings than the depository units , which affects the price banks can ask for derivatives .
So in the end , removing 716 just gives four banks a giant subsidy they would lose by splitting out the derivatives books , no different than the other CRomnibus riders that aid the bottom lines of wealthy benefactors . That has implications for safety as well – if risky derivatives are cheaper to fund and more profitable to trade , banks will increase their production . Furthermore , banks ’ concerns about possible energy swap losses related to the crash in oil prices added a sense of urgency .
I don ’ t think this means “ financial reform is working , ” as Matt Yglesias does , but it means some provisions have constrained bank profits , if not their risk . And the banks , up against a 2015 deadline to split off their swaps trading , wanted Congress to support their inalienable right to make money by killing the rule .
The origins of eliminating Section 716 go back to the writing of Dodd-Frank itself . Blanche Lincoln , author of the derivatives regulations in the bill , initially included practically all swaps . A combination of lobbyists , Wall Street-friendly “ New Democrats ” and the Treasury Department significantly rolled that back , limiting it to the riskiest bits , like credit default swaps that don ’ t go through a clearinghouse .
After wounding the provision , the banks employed their allies in Congress to disappear it entirely . A bipartisan coalition , including Jim Himes , D-Conn. , a former vice president at Goldman Sachs , introduced a host of bills to weaken derivatives rules as far back as 2011 . HR 992 , the “ Swaps Regulatory Improvement Act , ” sailed through the House Financial Services Committee 53-6 in spring 2013 . The language of this bill , written by Citigroup lobbyists , is virtually identical to what passed in the CRomnibus . Rep. Maxine Waters , the ranking member on the Democratic side , waged a fairly lonely battle to limit Democratic support . On the House floor , 70 Democrats voted for the final bill , far fewer than was initially expected . This enabled Senate Democrats to ignore the bill as a stand-alone entity .
House Republicans , egged on by Wall Street lobbyists , tried another tactic . Kevin Yoder , R-Kan. , a two-term member of the House Appropriations subcommittee overseeing financial services , stuck HR 992 into the financial services appropriations bill without a formal vote , pitching it as an aid to “ the farmer in your district who wants to get a loan , ” rather than Jamie Dimon or Lloyd Blankfein . Nobody ever tried to strip it out , and the rider easily advanced through the process .
Stuffing the rollback into a must-pass bill turned out to be a genius move . Lawmakers on the Appropriations committees have less understanding of complex bank maneuvers like derivatives than those on the banking committees . Furthermore , because all parties expected a year-end omnibus bill anyway , it didn ’ t make as much sense to fight every little provision , when a negotiated process would cover that down the road .
Finally , the Appropriations committees are notoriously insular . Whenever policy riders crop up , committees of jurisdiction try to reach out to appropriators with rapid response to explain their significance . But aides described a one-way street for communication , with lawmakers not on Appropriations frequently kept in the dark . Appropriators either consult the committees or ignore them at their own discretion and without warning . Though reformers assumed for years that the swaps provision would be attached to some must-pass vehicle , they had no idea about the fate of the rider until the whole bill was unveiled . That includes House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi , who described the process on the bill as “ radio silent . ”
Barbara Mikulski , D-Md. , the outgoing chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee , negotiated the CRomnibus with her House counterpart Hal Rogers , R-Ky. She ultimately signed off on the rider , in exchange for modest additional funding for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission , two Wall Street regulators .
Bank reform groups and sympathetic lawmakers didn ’ t consider it a good trade to give a couple of regulators a bit more money in exchange for limiting what they can regulate . But Mikulski claims that she faced nearly 100 riders in negotiations and fended off most of them . She also figured that any deal would get worse in 2015 , with big majorities coming in for Republicans .

Senate leaders had to know that this swaps provision , for example , would cause plenty of consternation among colleagues like Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass .

The U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service began sending out Economic Impact Payments as prepaid debit cards last week . So almost 4 million Americans still waiting for their cut of the $ 2.2 trillion CARES Act can expect to get their stimulus money in the form of an EIP Card , as opposed to a paper check .
Problem is , these Visa cards are being issued by MetaBank ( the Treasury ’ s financial agent ) and delivered in plain envelopes from Money Network Cardholder Services — neither of which is a familiar name for most of us . So reports of people mistaking these for preapproved credit-card junk mail , or even a scam , have been popping up across the country . And , in some cases , people have even thrown away the debit cards containing their long-awaited stimulus money before they realized their mistake .

Thomas and Bonnie Moore of southwest Florida are one such pair . They told local CBS VIAC , +3.80 % affiliate WINK-TV that they chucked their EIP Card because they were expecting a stimulus check from the U.S. Treasury . “ My husband looked at it , briefly read it and he said , ‘ Do you want this ? ’ And I said , ‘ I don ’ t need another fake card , ’ so he cut it up in little pieces , ” Bonnie Moore said . “ The next thing you see is I am in the garbage can trying to pull out all of the pieces together , which did not work . ”
Their neighbor also told the outlet that he found his prepaid debit card suspicious because it bore no official federal insignia , and the return address was in Omaha , Neb . “ Doesn ’ t sound like the federal government to me , ” he said .

Several people have also complained on Twitter TWTR , +2.97 % that they mistook their EIP Cards for junk mail :
This has led several authorities to reassure consumers that the EIP Cards are legit . Both the Nassau County district attorney ’ s office in New York and the Belmont , Mass. , police department have tweeted that this is “ not a scam. ” Better Business Bureau offices in Texas , Colorado and Alabama have all been fielding calls from concerned consumers asking if the debit cards are real . And the Iowa attorney general ’ s office said it received dozens of calls about the cards last Thursday and Friday . “ People were very confused , wondering what these were , ” a spokeswoman told a local NBC CMCSA , +1.46 % affiliate . “ They were throwing these in the garbage . ”
Neither the IRS nor the Treasury Department responded to ███ requests for comment on the confusion nor on the complaints about receiving debit cards instead of checks . But the IRS has been tweeting daily “ reminders ” this week that “ millions of people are getting Economic Impact Payments by prepaid debit card mailed in plain envelopes from Money Network Cardholder Services . ”
What ’ s more , the IRS also issued a press release on Wednesday afternoon with the subject line : “ Economic Impact Payments being sent by prepaid debit cards , arrive in plain envelope. ” It also answered several “ frequently asked questions ” about the cards , such as how the cards could be used without fees .
Because , yes , there are some fees tied to these EIP Cards , including a $ 7.50 replacement charge if the card is lost .
Among the dissatisfied customers complaining online about getting a debit card instead of a direct deposit or a check were those saying they ’ d prefer , and expected , a payment form that they could more easily cash or deposit into a bank account :
The Internal Revenue Service has distributed more than 128 million checks and paid over $ 218 billion as of early May . This includes $ 1,200 payments to individuals with adjusted gross income below $ 75,000 and $ 2,400 to married couples filing taxes jointly who earn under $ 150,000 , with payouts prorated above those income thresholds . And that money can ’ t come soon enough for the roughly 35 million Americans out of work since the coronavirus temporarily shut down large swaths of the economy .

Nearly 4 million people will receive a prepaid debit card instead of a paper check , which was determined by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service , another part of the Treasury Department that works with the IRS to handle distribution of the payments . In some cases , people who qualified for an Economic Impact Payment , but whose bank account information was not on file with the IRS , received a debit card in lieu of a check or a direct deposit .
How will I receive my card , and what does it look like ?
The EIP Cards are being sent to the most recent mailing address filed with the IRS . The cards will arrive in a plain envelope from Money Network Cardholder Services . The Visa name will appear on the front of the card , and the back of the card will feature the name of the issuing bank , MetaBank , N.A . The Welcome Packet will include information explaining that the card is an Economic Impact Payment Card .
Behold the EIP Card , a prepaid debit card containing one ’ s stimulus payment . epicard.com
The mailing will not include your balance , however . You ’ ll have to call and activate your card to find out how much stimulus money you get .
You will need to call 1-800-240-8100 to activate your card , and you will be asked to verify your identity by providing your name , address and the last six digits of your Social Security Number . You will also be asked to create a four-digit PIN required for ATM transactions and automated assistance and to hear your balance . Then you will register your card online at EIPCard.com , where you will create a user ID and a password , which you can also use on the accompanying Money Network Mobile App .
You can use your EIP Card to make purchases at stores accepting Visa cards . During checkout , you ’ ll insert your card into the reader or present it to the cashier . You may be asked to enter your four-digit PIN number or to sign for the transaction . You can also get cash back at participating merchants by punching in your PIN number .
When shopping online ( at merchants who accept Visa V , -0.45 % , naturally ) , you ’ ll need to enter the 16-digit card number when checking out , along with the expiration date and the three-digit code from the back of the card . You ’ ll also need to enter the billing address associated with your EIP Card .
For both shopping in stores and online , there is a $ 2,500 limit per transaction and per day limit . And the merchant ’ s cash back limit may be less .
You can withdraw cash at ATMs , get cash-back from participating merchants , or withdraw cash from a bank or credit union . But only some of these methods are free , and there are some limits to how much cash you can take at once .
Cash from an ATM : There ’ s no fee to withdraw cash at in-network ATMs , but fees may apply if you use an out-of-network ATM . Refer to this ATM Locator to determine which ones are in-network . To get cash , simply use this card like you would any debit card : insert the card , enter your PIN and select “ Withdraw ” from “ Checking. ” Just be warned that there ’ s a $ 1,000 ATM withdrawal limit per transaction and per day , and individual bank limits may be lower .
Cash back from participating merchants : As you would with any other debit card , select “ Debit ” when paying , then enter your PIN and select “ yes ” for the cash-back option . Enter the amount and then hit “ OK. ” Once again , there ’ s a $ 2,500 per transaction and per day limit , although individual merchant cash-back limits may be lowe .
Cash from a bank or credit union teller : You can visit any bank or credit union branch to withdraw cash , but fees may apply ( except for your very first withdrawal with the card . ) You ’ ll need to know your balance beforehand , since the teller can not tell how much money is on your EPI Card . You ’ ll also need to know your PIN for the card , and you will probably be asked for an additional form of ID , such as a government-issued photo ID card . Then you ’ ll ask the teller for the amount that you would like to withdraw . There ’ s a $ 2,500 per transaction and per day limit , although the bank ’ s limit may also be less .
What if I just want to transfer my balance into my bank account ?
You can transfer the funds from your EIP Card to your bank account online at EIPCard.com or using the Money Network Mobile App . You will need the routing number and the account number for your bank account , and you will need to have activated your EIP Card .
To transfer funds : Call 1-800-240-8100 to activate your EIP Card .
Register for online or mobile app access by going to EIPCard.com or the Money Network Mobile App and click on “ Register. ” Follow the steps to create your User ID and Password . Be sure to have your EIP Card handy .
Select “ Move Money Out ” and follow the steps to set up your ACH transfer . Transfers should post to your bank account in 1-2 business days . There ’ s a limit of $ 1,250 per transaction , $ 2,500 per day and $ 5,000 per month .
Those who receive their Economic Impact Payment by prepaid debit card can do the following without any fees :
• Make purchases online and at any retail location where Visa is accepted .
• Check their card balance online , by mobile app or by phone .
But you will be charged $ 2 for withdrawing money from out-of-network ATMS — after your first ATM withdrawal . Of course , you may also be charged a fee by the ATM operator , even if you do not complete a transaction . Refer to this ATM Locator .
There ’ s also a $ 5 bank teller over-the-counter cash withdrawal fee , although once again , the first time you withdraw funds from your card at a teller will be free . So if you ’ re planning to cash out your card from an ATM or a bank , the lesson here is to take it all out at once , if you can .
Perhaps most importantly , there ’ s a $ 7.50 fee to reissue a lost or stolen card . It will be shipped in seven to 10 business days after the reissue order is placed . If you want that card to be sent four to seven days after the order is placed , there ’ s also a $ 17 priority shipping fee .
Will the government be tracking what I spend the money on ?
No . Under the Right to Financial Privacy Act , the federal government is not allowed to ask the card issuer about your EIP Card account , and the card issuer is not allowed to give the government information about your EIP Card account without your written permission , except under very limited circumstances .
So these cards aren ’ t a scam — but what IRS scams should I watch out for ?
Be warned that the IRS will never call , text , email or reach out to you over social media to say it needs more information to process a payment . The same goes for banks and credit unions . You will only get such IRS correspondence by mail . Here are five red flags to watch out for from scammers trying to steal your stimulus money .","Don’t throw away that junk mail — or you might throw away your stimulus payment.

The U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service began sending out Economic Impact Payments as prepaid debit cards last week. So almost 4 million Americans still waiting for their cut of the $2.2 trillion CARES Act can expect to get their stimulus money in the form of an EIP Card, as opposed to a paper check.

Problem is, these Visa cards are being issued by MetaBank (the Treasury’s financial agent) and delivered in plain envelopes from Money Network Cardholder Services — neither of which is a familiar name for most of us. So reports of people mistaking these for preapproved credit-card junk mail, or even a scam, have been popping up across the country. And, in some cases, people have even thrown away the debit cards containing their long-awaited stimulus money before they realized their mistake.

Thomas and Bonnie Moore of southwest Florida are one such pair. They told local CBS VIAC, +3.80% affiliate WINK-TV that they chucked their EIP Card because they were expecting a stimulus check from the U.S. Treasury. “My husband looked at it, briefly read it and he said, ‘Do you want this?’ And I said, ‘I don’t need another fake card,’ so he cut it up in little pieces,” Bonnie Moore said. “The next thing you see is I am in the garbage can trying to pull out all of the pieces together, which did not work.”

Their neighbor also told the outlet that he found his prepaid debit card suspicious because it bore no official federal insignia, and the return address was in Omaha, Neb. “Doesn’t sound like the federal government to me,” he said.

Several people have also complained on Twitter TWTR, +2.97% that they mistook their EIP Cards for junk mail:

This has led several authorities to reassure consumers that the EIP Cards are legit. Both the Nassau County district attorney’s office in New York and the Belmont, Mass., police department have tweeted that this is “not a scam.” Better Business Bureau offices in Texas, Colorado and Alabama have all been fielding calls from concerned consumers asking if the debit cards are real. And the Iowa attorney general’s office said it received dozens of calls about the cards last Thursday and Friday. “People were very confused, wondering what these were,” a spokeswoman told a local NBC CMCSA, +1.46% affiliate. “They were throwing these in the garbage.”

Neither the IRS nor the Treasury Department responded to MarketWatch requests for comment on the confusion nor on the complaints about receiving debit cards instead of checks. But the IRS has been tweeting daily “reminders” this week that “millions of people are getting Economic Impact Payments by prepaid debit card mailed in plain envelopes from Money Network Cardholder Services.”

What’s more, the IRS also issued a press release on Wednesday afternoon with the subject line: “Economic Impact Payments being sent by prepaid debit cards, arrive in plain envelope.” It also answered several “frequently asked questions” about the cards, such as how the cards could be used without fees.

Because, yes, there are some fees tied to these EIP Cards, including a $7.50 replacement charge if the card is lost.

Among the dissatisfied customers complaining online about getting a debit card instead of a direct deposit or a check were those saying they’d prefer, and expected, a payment form that they could more easily cash or deposit into a bank account:

The Internal Revenue Service has distributed more than 128 million checks and paid over $218 billion as of early May. This includes $1,200 payments to individuals with adjusted gross income below $75,000 and $2,400 to married couples filing taxes jointly who earn under $150,000, with payouts prorated above those income thresholds. And that money can’t come soon enough for the roughly 35 million Americans out of work since the coronavirus temporarily shut down large swaths of the economy.

May 13 was the last day that Americans could submit direct-deposit information to receive stimulus checks, which means payments will arrive as either checks or debit cards moving forward.

And here’s some important things you need to know about the prepaid debit cards, including what they look like, how they can be used — and where there could be hidden fees. You can also see an exhaustive list of questions and answers at the EIP Card website eipcard.com/faq or by calling customer service at 1-800-240-8100.

Who’s getting a debit card?

Nearly 4 million people will receive a prepaid debit card instead of a paper check, which was determined by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, another part of the Treasury Department that works with the IRS to handle distribution of the payments. In some cases, people who qualified for an Economic Impact Payment, but whose bank account information was not on file with the IRS, received a debit card in lieu of a check or a direct deposit.

How will I receive my card, and what does it look like?

The EIP Cards are being sent to the most recent mailing address filed with the IRS. The cards will arrive in a plain envelope from Money Network Cardholder Services. The Visa name will appear on the front of the card, and the back of the card will feature the name of the issuing bank, MetaBank, N.A. The Welcome Packet will include information explaining that the card is an Economic Impact Payment Card.

Check it out:

Behold the EIP Card, a prepaid debit card containing one’s stimulus payment. epicard.com

The mailing will not include your balance, however. You’ll have to call and activate your card to find out how much stimulus money you get.

How do I use my card?

You will need to call 1-800-240-8100 to activate your card, and you will be asked to verify your identity by providing your name, address and the last six digits of your Social Security Number. You will also be asked to create a four-digit PIN required for ATM transactions and automated assistance and to hear your balance. Then you will register your card online at EIPCard.com, where you will create a user ID and a password, which you can also use on the accompanying Money Network Mobile App.

You can use your EIP Card to make purchases at stores accepting Visa cards. During checkout, you’ll insert your card into the reader or present it to the cashier. You may be asked to enter your four-digit PIN number or to sign for the transaction. You can also get cash back at participating merchants by punching in your PIN number.

When shopping online (at merchants who accept Visa V, -0.45% , naturally), you’ll need to enter the 16-digit card number when checking out, along with the expiration date and the three-digit code from the back of the card. You’ll also need to enter the billing address associated with your EIP Card.

For both shopping in stores and online, there is a $2,500 limit per transaction and per day limit. And the merchant’s cash back limit may be less.

How do I cash out the card?

You can withdraw cash at ATMs, get cash-back from participating merchants, or withdraw cash from a bank or credit union. But only some of these methods are free, and there are some limits to how much cash you can take at once.

Cash from an ATM: There’s no fee to withdraw cash at in-network ATMs, but fees may apply if you use an out-of-network ATM. Refer to this ATM Locator to determine which ones are in-network. To get cash, simply use this card like you would any debit card: insert the card, enter your PIN and select “Withdraw” from “Checking.” Just be warned that there’s a $1,000 ATM withdrawal limit per transaction and per day, and individual bank limits may be lower.

Cash back from participating merchants: As you would with any other debit card, select “Debit” when paying, then enter your PIN and select “yes” for the cash-back option. Enter the amount and then hit “OK.” Once again, there’s a $2,500 per transaction and per day limit, although individual merchant cash-back limits may be lowe.

Cash from a bank or credit union teller: You can visit any bank or credit union branch to withdraw cash, but fees may apply (except for your very first withdrawal with the card.) You’ll need to know your balance beforehand, since the teller cannot tell how much money is on your EPI Card. You’ll also need to know your PIN for the card, and you will probably be asked for an additional form of ID, such as a government-issued photo ID card. Then you’ll ask the teller for the amount that you would like to withdraw. There’s a $2,500 per transaction and per day limit, although the bank’s limit may also be less.

What if I just want to transfer my balance into my bank account?

You can transfer the funds from your EIP Card to your bank account online at EIPCard.com or using the Money Network Mobile App. You will need the routing number and the account number for your bank account, and you will need to have activated your EIP Card.

To transfer funds: Call 1-800-240-8100 to activate your EIP Card.

Register for online or mobile app access by going to EIPCard.com or the Money Network Mobile App and click on “Register.” Follow the steps to create your User ID and Password. Be sure to have your EIP Card handy.

Select “Move Money Out” and follow the steps to set up your ACH transfer. Transfers should post to your bank account in 1-2 business days. There’s a limit of $1,250 per transaction, $2,500 per day and $5,000 per month.

So what are the fees?

Those who receive their Economic Impact Payment by prepaid debit card can do the following without any fees:

• Make purchases online and at any retail location where Visa is accepted.

• Get cash from in-network ATMs.

• Transfer funds to their personal bank account.

• Check their card balance online, by mobile app or by phone.

But you will be charged $2 for withdrawing money from out-of-network ATMS — after your first ATM withdrawal. Of course, you may also be charged a fee by the ATM operator, even if you do not complete a transaction. Refer to this ATM Locator.

There’s also a $5 bank teller over-the-counter cash withdrawal fee, although once again, the first time you withdraw funds from your card at a teller will be free. So if you’re planning to cash out your card from an ATM or a bank, the lesson here is to take it all out at once, if you can.

Perhaps most importantly, there’s a $7.50 fee to reissue a lost or stolen card. It will be shipped in seven to 10 business days after the reissue order is placed. If you want that card to be sent four to seven days after the order is placed, there’s also a $17 priority shipping fee.

Will the government be tracking what I spend the money on?

No. Under the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the federal government is not allowed to ask the card issuer about your EIP Card account, and the card issuer is not allowed to give the government information about your EIP Card account without your written permission, except under very limited circumstances.

So these cards aren’t a scam — but what IRS scams should I watch out for?

Be warned that the IRS will never call, text, email or reach out to you over social media to say it needs more information to process a payment. The same goes for banks and credit unions. You will only get such IRS correspondence by mail. Here are five red flags to watch out for from scammers trying to steal your stimulus money.

They are the hourly employees who work as cooks and dishwashers , cleaners and clerks . They are among the more than 250,000 unauthorized immigrants in Massachusetts who account for about 5 percent of the labor force , according to data from the Pew Research Center .
As Congress hammered out a $ 2 trillion stimulus plan to help those left jobless by the coronavirus pandemic , some of the most vulnerable were once again invisible : Not a penny will go to millions of undocumented immigrants , many of whom work in the hardest-hit industries of restaurants , hospitality , and retail .
One East Boston family of three went from two incomes to none on March 6 when both parents lost their restaurant jobs the same day . They ’ ve got enough savings — about $ 1,200 — to last a month .
“ I see the president speak . I see the governor speak about programs and support , ” said the mother , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she does not have legal status . “ I know those programs and support are for Americans . They are not for us . ”
She and her husband , who arrived on a travel visa from South America six years ago , worry about putting food on the table and paying their rent , but they won ’ t seek government assistance because they fear deportation . They just want to work again . Still , they wished they qualified for help , given the dire situation .
“ I don ’ t want to be forgotten , ” said the mother , speaking Spanish through a translator . “ As immigrants , we shouldn ’ t be left behind . ”

Both parents lost their jobs on March 6 due to the coronavirus pandemic and they wo n't qualify for unemployment benefits or stimulus money because they are not legal residents .

Her worries are shared across Massachusetts by hundreds of thousands of immigrants — documented and undocumented alike — who are wary of seeking government help for fear of being targeted for deportation , said state Senator Sonia Chang-Diaz , a Democrat from Boston .
“ There has been such an accumulation of fear-mongering over the last three-plus years , ” she said .
The Trump administration ’ s anti-immigrant policies and aggressive enforcement have fueled anxiety about deportation , and documented immigrants are also on alert because of new hurdles , enacted this year , that penalize potential citizens who access government assistance programs such as food stamps and public housing .
Concerns continue to linger , immigrant advocates said , even though federal immigration officials have said they will not conduct routine enforcement operations at or near health-care facilities such as hospitals , clinics , and doctors ’ offices during the coronavirus crisis .
Unemployment benefits also will not count against the so-called “ public charge ” test for immigrants who must show they can support themselves , according to the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute .
Still , it has been ingrained in some undocumented immigrant circles that applying for unemployment benefits is taboo .
`` Filing for unemployment is a third rail , ” said Diego Low , a coordinator at MetroWest Worker Center , which advocates for worker rights . “ It ’ s a sure way of calling [ Department of Homeland Security ’ s ] attention . ”
Congress ’ s economic rescue package aims to boost unemployment benefits , put direct cash payments of $ 1,200 into the hands of eligible taxpayers , and extend relief to nontraditional employees such as gig-economy workers like Uber drivers . These measures , however , won ’ t help undocumented workers , and immigration advocates are disappointed that more hasn ’ t been done to help this group .
“ We are happy to see the stimulus package but are concerned that immigration status has not been addressed , ” said Iván Espinoza-Madrigal , executive director of Lawyers for Civil Rights , a group that has been fielding hundreds of calls from documented and undocumented workers who have been laid off or furloughed during the pandemic .
That leaves undocumented workers fending for themselves and relying on nonprofit efforts , such as the MassUndocFund and Restaurant Strong Fund . Since last week , Restaurant Strong has helped 250 workers in need — giving them each a $ 1,000 cash grant .
One area that immigrants , regardless of status , should not worry about in Massachusetts is seeking testing and treatment for the coronavirus . The state is requiring insurers to cover the full cost of testing , counseling , and treatment ; no copayments or deductibles for these services will be applied .
“ There ’ s a possibility that people who get infected are not going to reach out to health care , potentially until the last moment , until they ’ re trying to access an emergency room , ” said Alexandra Weber , chief program director for the International Institute of New England , a nonprofit organization that offers resettlement , education , job help , and pathways to citizenship for immigrants and refugees .
“ I ’ m afraid people won ’ t get the level of service they deserve , ” said Weber , who added that institute staff have made more than 1,500 phone calls to reach out to clients about their options .
Dr. Julia Koehler , who chairs the Immigrant Health Committee of the state chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics , said she is worried that unauthorized immigrants will suffer disproportionately during the crisis .
“ They have been staying away from any official entity for years because they are afraid their information will be passed on , '' said Koehler , an infectious disease specialist who is an assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School . “ Some have never gone to the doctor since they came here . ”
The ramifications for the health of the general public are enormous , she said .
“ I find it deeply distressing and really heartbreaking . I can not emphasize enough how this puts everybody else at risk , ” Koehler said .
“ These people are petrified . They do not have the space in their brain right now to think about what does social distancing mean , what does cleaning my hands mean , what is droplet transmission , ” she added . “ As we care for them , we are caring for ourselves . ”
Koehler helped circulate an online petition to Governor Charlie Baker , signed by more than 2,500 people including hundreds of health professionals , that urges the state `` to make clear that it is safe to seek appropriate medical care ” and that immigrants “ requiring isolation and treatment will be cared for and not punished . ”
Those immigrants include Vanderleia da Silva , a 53-year-old housecleaner and undocumented immigrant from Brazil who has lost all 20 of her clients .
She has no income , no safety net , and no way of knowing what the future holds for her household of four in Medford .
Da Silva spends her days cleaning her own apartment now , rationing the two to three weeks of food she has stocked for her 15-year-old son , a friend , and the friend ’ s mother .
If anyone in the home contracts the virus , da Silva said , she does not know what she will do .
“ For now , we have a lot of food at home , '' da Silva said . “ But last night I couldn ’ t sleep until 2 or 3 , staying up and thinking about everything . What are we going to do ? ”","These immigrants typically pay taxes but don’t qualify for stimulus checks or unemployment benefits, which are reserved for US citizens and those legally authorized to work in the United States.

As Congress hammered out a $2 trillion stimulus plan to help those left jobless by the coronavirus pandemic, some of the most vulnerable were once again invisible: Not a penny will go to millions of undocumented immigrants, many of whom work in the hardest-hit industries of restaurants, hospitality, and retail.

One East Boston family of three went from two incomes to none on March 6 when both parents lost their restaurant jobs the same day. They’ve got enough savings — about $1,200 — to last a month.

“I see the president speak. I see the governor speak about programs and support,” said the mother, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she does not have legal status. “I know those programs and support are for Americans. They are not for us.”

She and her husband, who arrived on a travel visa from South America six years ago, worry about putting food on the table and paying their rent, but they won’t seek government assistance because they fear deportation. They just want to work again. Still, they wished they qualified for help, given the dire situation.

“I don’t want to be forgotten,” said the mother, speaking Spanish through a translator. “As immigrants, we shouldn’t be left behind.”

Her worries are shared across Massachusetts by hundreds of thousands of immigrants — documented and undocumented alike — who are wary of seeking government help for fear of being targeted for deportation, said state Senator Sonia Chang-Diaz, a Democrat from Boston.

“There has been such an accumulation of fear-mongering over the last three-plus years,” she said.

The Trump administration’s anti-immigrant policies and aggressive enforcement have fueled anxiety about deportation, and documented immigrants are also on alert because of new hurdles, enacted this year, that penalize potential citizens who access government assistance programs such as food stamps and public housing.

Concerns continue to linger, immigrant advocates said, even though federal immigration officials have said they will not conduct routine enforcement operations at or near health-care facilities such as hospitals, clinics, and doctors’ offices during the coronavirus crisis.

Unemployment benefits also will not count against the so-called “public charge” test for immigrants who must show they can support themselves, according to the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute.

Still, it has been ingrained in some undocumented immigrant circles that applying for unemployment benefits is taboo.

""Filing for unemployment is a third rail,” said Diego Low, a coordinator at MetroWest Worker Center, which advocates for worker rights. “It’s a sure way of calling [Department of Homeland Security’s] attention.”

Congress’s economic rescue package aims to boost unemployment benefits, put direct cash payments of $1,200 into the hands of eligible taxpayers, and extend relief to nontraditional employees such as gig-economy workers like Uber drivers. These measures, however, won’t help undocumented workers, and immigration advocates are disappointed that more hasn’t been done to help this group.

“We are happy to see the stimulus package but are concerned that immigration status has not been addressed,” said Iván Espinoza-Madrigal, executive director of Lawyers for Civil Rights, a group that has been fielding hundreds of calls from documented and undocumented workers who have been laid off or furloughed during the pandemic.

That leaves undocumented workers fending for themselves and relying on nonprofit efforts, such as the MassUndocFund and Restaurant Strong Fund. Since last week, Restaurant Strong has helped 250 workers in need — giving them each a $1,000 cash grant.

One area that immigrants, regardless of status, should not worry about in Massachusetts is seeking testing and treatment for the coronavirus. The state is requiring insurers to cover the full cost of testing, counseling, and treatment; no copayments or deductibles for these services will be applied.

However, skepticism runs deep, immigrant advocates said.

“There’s a possibility that people who get infected are not going to reach out to health care, potentially until the last moment, until they’re trying to access an emergency room,” said Alexandra Weber, chief program director for the International Institute of New England, a nonprofit organization that offers resettlement, education, job help, and pathways to citizenship for immigrants and refugees.

“I’m afraid people won’t get the level of service they deserve,” said Weber, who added that institute staff have made more than 1,500 phone calls to reach out to clients about their options.

Dr. Julia Koehler, who chairs the Immigrant Health Committee of the state chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said she is worried that unauthorized immigrants will suffer disproportionately during the crisis.

“They have been staying away from any official entity for years because they are afraid their information will be passed on,"" said Koehler, an infectious disease specialist who is an assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. “Some have never gone to the doctor since they came here.”

The ramifications for the health of the general public are enormous, she said.

“I find it deeply distressing and really heartbreaking. I cannot emphasize enough how this puts everybody else at risk,” Koehler said.

“These people are petrified. They do not have the space in their brain right now to think about what does social distancing mean, what does cleaning my hands mean, what is droplet transmission,” she added. “As we care for them, we are caring for ourselves.”

Koehler helped circulate an online petition to Governor Charlie Baker, signed by more than 2,500 people including hundreds of health professionals, that urges the state ""to make clear that it is safe to seek appropriate medical care” and that immigrants “requiring isolation and treatment will be cared for and not punished.”

Those immigrants include Vanderleia da Silva, a 53-year-old housecleaner and undocumented immigrant from Brazil who has lost all 20 of her clients.

She has no income, no safety net, and no way of knowing what the future holds for her household of four in Medford.

Da Silva spends her days cleaning her own apartment now, rationing the two to three weeks of food she has stocked for her 15-year-old son, a friend, and the friend’s mother.

If anyone in the home contracts the virus, da Silva said, she does not know what she will do.

“Of course, I’m afraid. I’m losing everything,"" she said.

“For now, we have a lot of food at home,"" da Silva said. “But last night I couldn’t sleep until 2 or 3, staying up and thinking about everything. What are we going to do?”

`` It is clear that confronting this virus will take boldness , bipartisanship , and a comprehensive approach , '' McConnell said in a statement . `` Discussions are already underway on these key pillars .

Ben Cardin Benjamin ( Ben ) Louis CardinTeetering economy sparks talk of second stimulus package Democratic senators ask IRS to extend tax filing deadline amid coronavirus outbreak New coronavirus phase puts spotlight on White House pick MORE ( Md . ) , the top Democrat on the Senate Small Business Committee , said late last week that he and his Republican colleagues are almost 90 percent of the way toward agreeing on a small-business relief package that will be broken up into two parts .
He said the first component will be attached to the House-passed coronavirus bill and the second to a broader measure that ’ s likely to include some of the tax-relief measures favored by President Trump Donald John TrumpThe Hill 's Morning Report - Biden commits to female VP ; CDC says no events of 50+ people for 8 weeks This week : Senate balances surveillance fight with growing coronavirus concerns Juan Williams : Trump must be held to account over coronavirus MORE .
Cardin anticipates the House-passed coronavirus measure will eventually include a $ 50 billion expansion in loan capacity for small businesses .
“ It ’ s more easing the requirement for loans , those types of issues . It ’ s allowing the loans to be used for paid leave and telecommuting , ” Cardin said . “ That ’ s phase one . ”
Cardin said he wants the second tranche of small-business relief to include grants for small businesses . That would be added to a second stimulus package expected to move next month .
“ Then there ’ s part two , when we have a stimulus package that considers some of the tax issues the president wants to consider , ” said Cardin , who is also a member of the Senate Finance Committee .
“ We have businesses that are going to need grants . Loans [ alone ] aren ’ t going to work , that ’ s very clear . We have Republican support for that , so we ’ re going to have to look for a grant program for small businesses , ” he said .
A senior Senate Republican aide on Friday confirmed that lawmakers will begin working on a second stimulus package soon after Congress passes the coronavirus relief package that Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiThe Hill 's Morning Report - Biden commits to female VP ; CDC says no events of 50+ people for 8 weeks This week : Senate balances surveillance fight with growing coronavirus concerns Teetering economy sparks talk of second stimulus package MORE ( D-Calif. ) and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Steven Terner MnuchinThis week : Senate balances surveillance fight with growing coronavirus concerns Teetering economy sparks talk of second stimulus package Fauci says coronavirus response may look like 'overreaction ' but could prevent worst-case scenario MORE negotiated at the end of last week .
“ We ’ re going to see a humongous spike in cases in the next two weeks as we get more and more testing available , and that will create further economic distress , ” the source said .
The aide said a second package will give senators a chance to push for things “ the things that Republicans want that Pelosi is saying no to now . At some point we will have to provide business relief . We will have to provide relief to airlines . ”
Mark Zandi , chief economist for Moody ’ s Analytics who now puts the chances of a U.S. recession this year at 70 percent , said he expects pressure will grow on Congress to pass several stimulus packages .
“ I think a large , timely well-thought fiscal stimulus package to avoid recession or to mitigate the severity of the recession that is now likely , ” he said . “ I think they could make it clear very soon that a second stimulus package is coming . ”
He said quick-hitting temporary relief such as expanded unemployment insurance or tax rebates like the kind Congress passed during the Great Recession are prime candidates for the second round of stimulus .
Zandi said a payroll tax cut is “ on the list ” but toward the bottom .
“ Much more important is to significantly expand out unemployment insurance to workers who don ’ t actually lose their jobs but can ’ t get to work because they ’ re sick or they have to take care of sick family members or their kids can ’ t go to school , ” he said .
“ Loans and loan guarantees are tried-and-true stimulus , and that should be part of any package , but that ’ s pretty modest in terms of its stimulus , ” he said .
John Weaver , a Republican aide who worked on former Ohio Gov . John Kasich ’ s 2016 presidential campaign , said Trump will be pressing Congress hard for additional stimulus .
“ He ’ s going to be tremendously desperate , as we ’ re seeing , ” Weaver said , noting that Trump has hammered the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates and that “ they don ’ t have much more room to maneuver . ”
Weaver warned that Trump ’ s chances of winning reelection would be significantly lower if the country falls into and stays in a recession .
If the economy fails to recover , he said , “ I think it will really lock him out of being reelected . ''
“ Presidents get the credit when things are going well and they get the blame when things don ’ t , ” Weaver added .
“ Prior to the coronavirus , he was definitely on the way to winning reelection , ” said Ford O ’ Connell , a Republican strategist . “ I do think the coronavirus puts a curveball into it and I think that he is wise to be pushing back and reminding people that the coronavirus came from China , which he ’ s been on for a very long time in terms of decoupling our supply chain . ”

Sen. Ben Cardin Benjamin (Ben) Louis CardinTeetering economy sparks talk of second stimulus package Democratic senators ask IRS to extend tax filing deadline amid coronavirus outbreak New coronavirus phase puts spotlight on White House pick MORE (Md.), the top Democrat on the Senate Small Business Committee, said late last week that he and his Republican colleagues are almost 90 percent of the way toward agreeing on a small-business relief package that will be broken up into two parts.

He said the first component will be attached to the House-passed coronavirus bill and the second to a broader measure that’s likely to include some of the tax-relief measures favored by President Trump Donald John TrumpThe Hill's Morning Report - Biden commits to female VP; CDC says no events of 50+ people for 8 weeks This week: Senate balances surveillance fight with growing coronavirus concerns Juan Williams: Trump must be held to account over coronavirus MORE.

Cardin anticipates the House-passed coronavirus measure will eventually include a $50 billion expansion in loan capacity for small businesses.

“It’s more easing the requirement for loans, those types of issues. It’s allowing the loans to be used for paid leave and telecommuting,” Cardin said. “That’s phase one.”

Cardin said he wants the second tranche of small-business relief to include grants for small businesses. That would be added to a second stimulus package expected to move next month.

“Then there’s part two, when we have a stimulus package that considers some of the tax issues the president wants to consider,” said Cardin, who is also a member of the Senate Finance Committee.

“We have businesses that are going to need grants. Loans [alone] aren’t going to work, that’s very clear. We have Republican support for that, so we’re going to have to look for a grant program for small businesses,” he said.

A senior Senate Republican aide on Friday confirmed that lawmakers will begin working on a second stimulus package soon after Congress passes the coronavirus relief package that Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiThe Hill's Morning Report - Biden commits to female VP; CDC says no events of 50+ people for 8 weeks This week: Senate balances surveillance fight with growing coronavirus concerns Teetering economy sparks talk of second stimulus package MORE (D-Calif.) and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Steven Terner MnuchinThis week: Senate balances surveillance fight with growing coronavirus concerns Teetering economy sparks talk of second stimulus package Fauci says coronavirus response may look like 'overreaction' but could prevent worst-case scenario MORE negotiated at the end of last week.

“We’re going to see a humongous spike in cases in the next two weeks as we get more and more testing available, and that will create further economic distress,” the source said.

The aide said a second package will give senators a chance to push for things “the things that Republicans want that Pelosi is saying no to now. At some point we will have to provide business relief. We will have to provide relief to airlines.”

Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics who now puts the chances of a U.S. recession this year at 70 percent, said he expects pressure will grow on Congress to pass several stimulus packages.

“I think a large, timely well-thought fiscal stimulus package to avoid recession or to mitigate the severity of the recession that is now likely,” he said. “I think they could make it clear very soon that a second stimulus package is coming.”

He said quick-hitting temporary relief such as expanded unemployment insurance or tax rebates like the kind Congress passed during the Great Recession are prime candidates for the second round of stimulus.

Zandi said a payroll tax cut is “on the list” but toward the bottom.

“Much more important is to significantly expand out unemployment insurance to workers who don’t actually lose their jobs but can’t get to work because they’re sick or they have to take care of sick family members or their kids can’t go to school,” he said.

Zandi also raised concerns about grants to small businesses.

“Loans and loan guarantees are tried-and-true stimulus, and that should be part of any package, but that’s pretty modest in terms of its stimulus,” he said.

John Weaver, a Republican aide who worked on former Ohio Gov. John Kasich’s 2016 presidential campaign, said Trump will be pressing Congress hard for additional stimulus.

“He’s going to be tremendously desperate, as we’re seeing,” Weaver said, noting that Trump has hammered the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates and that “they don’t have much more room to maneuver.”

Weaver warned that Trump’s chances of winning reelection would be significantly lower if the country falls into and stays in a recession.

If the economy fails to recover, he said, “I think it will really lock him out of being reelected.""

“Presidents get the credit when things are going well and they get the blame when things don’t,” Weaver added.

“Prior to the coronavirus, he was definitely on the way to winning reelection,” said Ford O’Connell, a Republican strategist. “I do think the coronavirus puts a curveball into it and I think that he is wise to be pushing back and reminding people that the coronavirus came from China, which he’s been on for a very long time in terms of decoupling our supply chain.”

“He’s trying to make the point, ‘I’m doing the best I can for America with the hand I’ve been dealt with,’” O’Connell added.

Mr. Azar also said the “has the tools and knows the tools to keep this economy going.”

“But his first focus is public health,” he said on Fox News.
