The shift is a blow particularly since it directly follows an attempt by Obama to redefine his foreign policy , including a major address at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point last week .

In further criticism on the international front , 58 percent say the Obama administration has tried to cover up the facts about the attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi , Libya , in 2012 , essentially the same as sentiment on the issue a year ago . Fewer , but still half - 51 percent - favor a fresh round of congressional hearings .
Some respite may be in the offing : While Obama gets an even 45-45 percent rating on handling one central element of U.S. foreign policy , the situation in Afghanistan , that blossoms to 77 percent support - including 57 percent `` strong '' support - specifically for his plan , announced last week , to remove most U.S. forces there . Even among Republicans and strong conservatives , hardly Obama fans , six in 10 support the drawdown .
Here at home , further , the president escapes substantial blame for the veterans ' hospitals scandal that forced a Cabinet resignation last week . But his weak ratings on domestic issues , notably the economy and the health care law , continue to damage Obama and his party , and his lost ground on international affairs only adds to his to-do list .
Still , this poll , produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates , suggests that Obama 's spring could be worse . Results released yesterday found broad support for proposed regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions , a new initiative of Obama 's . And his job approval overall has ticked up to 46 percent , from a career-low 41 percent in late April . But 51 percent disapprove ; the president has n't seen a net positive approval rating since last July , nearly a year ago .
Domestic issues dominate public concerns , and here the president 's performance remains more unpopular than popular . Fifty-three percent disapprove of his handling of the economy , vs. 43 percent who approve . Fifty-six percent disapprove of his handling of the implementation of the new health care law , vs. 39 percent approval . And half view his work on immigration negatively , up 9 points in the past year as the issue has bogged down in Congress . Just 38 percent approve .
Across these , moreover , intensity of sentiment is sharply against the president , with strong disapproval exceeding strong approval by roughly 2-1 margins .
Other presidents have done worse . At roughly this point in 2006 , Obama 's predecessor , George W.

Saudi Arabia denied any involvement in the disappearance of Washington Post contributing journalist Jamal Khashoggi and warned Sunday that any sanctions against the oil-rich kingdom would be met with ""greater action"" and possibly exploding oil prices.

""The kingdom affirms its total rejection of any threats and attempts to undermine it, whether by threatening to impose economic sanctions, using political pressures or repeating false accusations,"" the government said in a statement released to Saudi media. ""The Kingdom also affirms that if it receives any action, it will respond with greater action.""

President Donald Trump said Saudi Arabia could face ""severe punishment"" over Khashoggi, feared murdered after he entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.

""So, would you cut that off?"" Stahl asked.

Today , relative peace still exists in Bosnia-Herzegovina , Serbia and Croatia — and this situation offers valuable lessons that can be applied to one of the biggest humanitarian problems of our time .
The Syrian refugee and migration crisis is overwhelming the mechanisms set up by the international community to deal with such movements . European countries are caught between their instincts to offer safety and help to desperate people , and their inability to meet the needs of an unmanageable flood of migrants .
The migration , with no apparent end in sight , also has brought growing political pressure from disgruntled populations themselves displaced by waves of migrants . This threatens increased radicalism and political instability throughout Europe . And most importantly , we must assume that uncontrolled movement of hundreds of thousands of people from the Middle East will pose a growing security threat as jihadists take advantage of the movement and hide among them .
That is a threat that we Americans also must address .
The only reasonable alternative to dealing with this disaster is to create the conditions in and near Syria that will permit people to remain there , in humane conditions of relative safety near their home country , within their own culture .
Achieving this will require the United States , our allies and other cooperating powers to create areas in and near Syria where Syrians can find safety from attack .
As difficult as this task sounds — and surely it is — it has been done before .
When Yugoslavia collapsed in 1993 , modern , well-equipped armies clashed in open prolonged warfare , involving sieges of towns and cities , generating hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of refugees and displaced persons . In this , as in the current situation in Syria , violence was pervasive and inescapable .
Yet into that horror stepped the international community ’ s relief organizations , led by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees . That organization , backed by a U.N. mandate and protected first by the U.N. Protection Force and then NATO , created safe areas for refugees and internally displaced persons , and sheltered and fed millions of Bosnians .

Unfortunately , the Syrian humanitarian tragedy has not generated this sort of attention and action . Jordan , Lebanon and Turkey are already doing their utmost to care for millions of refugees , largely relying on their own resources . Germany and other countries have opened their doors to refugees but the political and economic costs are clearly unsustainable . Clearly , a better alternative needs to be proposed .
To finally address those needs effectively , we need a massive commitment from the world community to set up , fund and manage humane safe areas both within Syria and in neighboring countries .
This will require , first , a mandate from the U.N. Security Council , unleashing the U.N. High Commission for Refugees and other international resources experienced in humanitarian relief . This will also require either a new protection force such as the U.N. Protection Force in the Bosnia precedent , or some other coalition of the willing empowered to protect the people in the safe areas established in Syria itself .
Second , protecting these areas in Syria will require no-fly zones . I have suggested that , with its planning and leadership capabilities and massive resources , NATO should take on that job . NATO did it in Bosnia — why not Syria ? At the same time , NATO must work creatively to bring in the regional powers in a broad coordinated effort under NATO leadership .
Third , the international community must be willing to pay for this important humanitarian effort . We should call for major contributions from the regional states , European countries and other traditional donor countries long committed to humanitarian causes .
Dealing with so many refugees in safe , humane conditions will be expensive , but it can be no more expensive than the costs already being born by those destination countries burdened with uncontrolled migration . Germany estimates that the cost of the refugee crisis this year in Germany alone is 21 billion euros . Italy spent 628 million euros in 2014 and has budgeted 800 million for 2015 . Individual islands in Greece have spent between 1 billion and 1.5 billion euros this year . The EU has allocated 560 million euros for the crisis .
In that context , the billions necessary to enable the U.N. High Commission for Refugees , the International Committee of the Red Cross and others to care for these desperate people humanely , in conditions of safety , in or near their own homeland , are easily justified .
And the extra security gained by such a solution is beyond a price .
• Dan Coats is a Republican member of the U.S. Senate from Indiana .","ANALYSIS/OPINION:

The international community just celebrated the 20th anniversary of the Dayton Accords, a landmark peace agreement that brought an end to the Bosnian War and a grave humanitarian crisis in the Balkans.

Today, relative peace still exists in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia and Croatia — and this situation offers valuable lessons that can be applied to one of the biggest humanitarian problems of our time.

The Syrian refugee and migration crisis is overwhelming the mechanisms set up by the international community to deal with such movements. European countries are caught between their instincts to offer safety and help to desperate people, and their inability to meet the needs of an unmanageable flood of migrants.

The migration, with no apparent end in sight, also has brought growing political pressure from disgruntled populations themselves displaced by waves of migrants. This threatens increased radicalism and political instability throughout Europe. And most importantly, we must assume that uncontrolled movement of hundreds of thousands of people from the Middle East will pose a growing security threat as jihadists take advantage of the movement and hide among them.

That is a threat that we Americans also must address.

The only reasonable alternative to dealing with this disaster is to create the conditions in and near Syria that will permit people to remain there, in humane conditions of relative safety near their home country, within their own culture.

Achieving this will require the United States, our allies and other cooperating powers to create areas in and near Syria where Syrians can find safety from attack.

As difficult as this task sounds — and surely it is — it has been done before.

When Yugoslavia collapsed in 1993, modern, well-equipped armies clashed in open prolonged warfare, involving sieges of towns and cities, generating hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of refugees and displaced persons. In this, as in the current situation in Syria, violence was pervasive and inescapable.

Yet into that horror stepped the international community’s relief organizations, led by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. That organization, backed by a U.N. mandate and protected first by the U.N. Protection Force and then NATO, created safe areas for refugees and internally displaced persons, and sheltered and fed millions of Bosnians. Despite some tragic failures (the “safe area” of Srebrenica where thousands of Bosnians were slaughtered as the protectors looked on), this massive international effort to address Bosnia’s humanitarian catastrophe was an important contribution to successful efforts to end that war.

The Bosnia precedent included two essential components — the U.N. Security Council and NATO. It is remarkable that in the current crisis neither organization has devoted much attention — or any action — to addressing Syria’s humanitarian needs.

Unfortunately, the Syrian humanitarian tragedy has not generated this sort of attention and action. Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey are already doing their utmost to care for millions of refugees, largely relying on their own resources. Germany and other countries have opened their doors to refugees but the political and economic costs are clearly unsustainable. Clearly, a better alternative needs to be proposed.

To finally address those needs effectively, we need a massive commitment from the world community to set up, fund and manage humane safe areas both within Syria and in neighboring countries.

This will require, first, a mandate from the U.N. Security Council, unleashing the U.N. High Commission for Refugees and other international resources experienced in humanitarian relief. This will also require either a new protection force such as the U.N. Protection Force in the Bosnia precedent, or some other coalition of the willing empowered to protect the people in the safe areas established in Syria itself.

Second, protecting these areas in Syria will require no-fly zones. I have suggested that, with its planning and leadership capabilities and massive resources, NATO should take on that job. NATO did it in Bosnia — why not Syria? At the same time, NATO must work creatively to bring in the regional powers in a broad coordinated effort under NATO leadership.

Third, the international community must be willing to pay for this important humanitarian effort. We should call for major contributions from the regional states, European countries and other traditional donor countries long committed to humanitarian causes.

Dealing with so many refugees in safe, humane conditions will be expensive, but it can be no more expensive than the costs already being born by those destination countries burdened with uncontrolled migration. Germany estimates that the cost of the refugee crisis this year in Germany alone is 21 billion euros. Italy spent 628 million euros in 2014 and has budgeted 800 million for 2015. Individual islands in Greece have spent between 1 billion and 1.5 billion euros this year. The EU has allocated 560 million euros for the crisis.

In that context, the billions necessary to enable the U.N. High Commission for Refugees, the International Committee of the Red Cross and others to care for these desperate people humanely, in conditions of safety, in or near their own homeland, are easily justified.

And the extra security gained by such a solution is beyond a price.

Social media users were quick to exploit the report about the American president ’ s exploring the purchase of Greenland . One photoshopped a pompous-looking golden tower into a picture of Greenlandic villages with colorful two-story wooden houses . Another asked if Denmark could trade Greenland for Hawaii .
But at the center of the international contretemps , there was little to laugh about , politicians and residents said .
“ It ’ s never nice to be treated as a commodity , ” said Aaja Chemnitz Larsen , a Greenlandic member of the Danish Parliament .
Greenland , a nation of 56,000 , has a shared history with Denmark since the first Vikings settled there a millennium ago . If that relationship were to change , it would not be up to Denmark and certainly not up to an American president ’ s “ impulse , ” said Henrik O. Breitenbauch , an expert on Greenland and the head of the Center for Military Studies at Copenhagen University .
“ You don ’ t just trade people and countries , ” Mr. Breitenbauch added .
The speculation is that Mr. Trump , a former real estate developer , was keen on Greenland because he tends to see the world through a prism of acquisitions . And Greenland , located among both friendly and hostile neighbors , has everything a real estate investor could desire in terms of fresh air , direct access to the sea , an abundance of shrimp , cod and halibut and a backyard rich with lucrative minerals .
Nearby international sea routes allow for quick passage to all corners of the globe ( when the ice permits ) . But the island ’ s population may see little to gain from exchanging the Danish queen as their head of state with an American president who has angered traditional allies by disparaging NATO and pulling the United States out of long-held treaties like the Paris climate accord .
“ Greenland could choose to become Puerto Rico with snow , but I doubt there ’ s much interest in that , ” Mr. Breitenbauch said , referring to the unincorporated United States territory .","The Danish prime minister’s office did not immediately return a call on Friday seeking comment.

foreign_policy,Time Magazine,0,https://time.com/5765534/vladimir-putin-russia-constitution-medvedev/,'A Bloodless Revolution.' Putin’s Plan to Rewrite Russia’s Constitution Could Allow Him to Lead for Years to Come,,Simon Shuster,"Even in 2018 , when Vladimir Putin still had a full six years to serve as President of Russia , the political class around the Kremlin began to whisper about what comes next .
Some pundits referred to the problem as Operation 2024 , the year when Putin would have to decide whether – or , more likely , how – he would remain in power after his final term runs out . That operation appeared to begin on Wednesday , Jan. 15 , the day after Russians emerged from their long winter holiday .
In his annual state of the nation address in Moscow , Putin announced his wish to reform the Russian constitution . “ I truly believe that it is time to introduce certain changes to our country ’ s main law , ” Putin said . Shortly afterward the government resigned en masse , not in protest but seemingly to pave the way for these reforms .
The changes Putin proposed would not blow up the edifice of Russian democracy ; the president ’ s best-considered moves tend to be more subtle and circumspect than that . What he suggested instead is a revision of the constitution that could , in effect , give him more flexibility , rewire the ticking clock of his last presidential term and provide him with a range of options for remaining the leader of Russia , regardless of what formal title he chooses to hold in the future .
The details of his plan were vague and in many ways confusing , though their significance was not lost on those close to the Kremlin . “ You wanted a bloodless revolution ? ” tweeted one of Putin ’ s favored messengers , Margarita Simonyan , who leads the RT television network . “ Here you go . ”
It may be bloodless , but Wednesday ’ s revolution still had its victims . The clearest one appeared to be Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev , the President ’ s perennial sidekick and political stunt double , who has been carrying water for Putin since the two were both provincial officials in the 1990s in the mayoralty of St. Petersburg .
After Medvedev announced he and his government would stand down , Putin then graciously suggested that the outgoing Prime Minister take a newly created post : Deputy Chairman of the Kremlin Security Council overseeing national defense . Fancy as that may sound , it was an obvious demotion for Medvedev , who at least within the formal hierarchy of the state has been second only to Putin for the last eight years .
The sudden vacancies inside the government set off a frenetic debate in Russia about who would fill the next cabinet . But in a system where all the power has been gradually concentrated in the hands of one man over the last two decades , any speculation over government posts has barely any consequence . More than anything , it felt like a useful distraction as Putin begins to enact his plan for 2024 .
The obscure institution that came into the foreground amid Putin ’ s announcement on Wednesday was the State Council , which the President created during his first year in power in 2000 . Made up of regional governors and other officials selected by Putin , the Council formally serves as an advisory body to the Kremlin but , throughout its existence , has been known primarily as a state appendage whose function no one quite understood . Under the constitutional reforms Putin proposed in his annual address , however , the State Council could be granted new powers .

“ It would make sense , ” Putin said in his address on Wednesday , “ to firm up the status and role of the State Council in the Constitution of Russia . ”
He gave no details as to what that could mean . But the proposal led some observers to speculate that , after Putin ’ s term runs out in 2024 , he could decide to take the helm of the State Council and effectively continue to govern Russia from there . “ Putin looks like he is counting on becoming the head of the State Council , which will get increased powers and become a key decision-making platform with input from the Presidential Administration , the government and the governors , ” Tatiana Stanovaya , an expert at the Carnegie Moscow Center think tank , wrote in a Facebook post . In all but name , this newly empowered entity , with Putin at its helm , could then begin to function as a de facto Kremlin .
That , at least , was one of the possibilities that emerged from the political confusion that Putin created on Wednesday . And if his past behavior is any guide , the President himself may not yet have decided exactly which possibility he prefers . As Putin ’ s longserving adviser Gleb Pavlovsky once told me , Putin is a shrewd tactician and a lousy strategist . Rather than settling on a long-term course and sticking to it , he likes to keep a range of options open . Depending on the public mood and the risks that arise in the moment , he then places his bet on a short-term maneuver , making sure to leave just enough space to turn back or change course if necessary .
What he has long seemed unwilling to tolerate are strict limits on his power , especially those built in to Russia ’ s constitution . That much became clear in 2008 , when constitutional term limits first made him leave the post of President . He then devised a way to stay in power with minimal tweaks to the law . Rather than rewriting the constitution outright – as he clearly had the power to do – Putin announced in 2008 that he would move over to the post of Prime Minister , while Medvedev , his protégé , would serve as President .
Once in office , President Medvedev enacted a constitutional reform that extended presidential terms from four to six years . As Medvedev ’ s four years in office were close to running out at the end of 2011 , he faithfully moved aside , allowing Putin to return to the presidency for another two terms , this time lasting six years each .
The end of those two terms is still four years away . But that is clearly close enough for Putin to set Operation 2024 in motion . Its outcome will depend on factors that are still very hard to predict . How will the Russian public respond to the prospect of a leader for life ? How strong are the loyalties of Russia ’ s elites heading into this new phase of Putinism ?
But such questions come with familiar risks for Putin . He circumvented them in 2008 and at other crucial junctures in his tenure .

`` You are not willing to protect the people , but you do not want another force to come and protect us . You have sold us . This is immoral , '' Mazloum added .
He insisted the US either help stop the Turkish attack or allow the Syrian Democratic Forces to strike a deal with the Assad regime in Damascus and their Russian backers , allowing Russian warplanes to enforce a no-fly zone over northeast Syria , thereby denying Turkey the ability to carry out airstrikes . The US does not want the Kurds turning to the Russians , administration officials say .
`` I need to know if you are capable of protecting my people , of stopping these bombs falling on us or not . I need to know , because if you 're not , I need to make a deal with Russia and the regime now and invite their planes to protect this region , '' Mazloum said .
Turkey launched its long-threatened incursion into Syria after President Donald Trump ordered a small contingent of about 50 US troops to be pulled back from the border area amid a belief that a Turkish incursion was imminent . Before that , as a confidence building measure with Turkey , the US convinced Kurds to dismantle their defensive fortifications along the border and pull their fighters back . The US said Turkey had agreed to the arrangement which sought to prevent unilateral Turkish military action .
Senior members of the Trump administration have insisted Turkey would have invaded regardless of whether US troops had remained and that the US has not deserted the Syrian Kurds , however the US government has not taken action yet to stop the Turkish incursion .
Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said Friday the US is not abandoning its Kurdish allies , although he made it clear the US military will not intervene in the fight .
`` We are not abandoning our Kurdish partner forces and US troops remain with them in other parts of Syria , '' Esper told reporters at the Pentagon .
`` We remain in close coordination with the Syrian Democratic Forces who helped us destroy the physical caliphate of ISIS , but I will not place American service members in the middle of a longstanding conflict between the Turks and the Kurds , this is not why we are in Syria , '' Esper said .

Trump signed an executive order Friday giving the Treasury Department `` very significant new sanctions authorities '' against Turkey over its actions in Syria , but the US does n't have any immediate plans to use them , Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin said .
The Treasury statement had said that Trump 's threat of sanctions was meant to dissuade Turkey from actions that included `` the indiscriminate targeting of civilians , targeting of civilian infrastructure , targeting of ethnic or religious minorities . ''
Trump , who has a well-established affinity for authoritarian leaders , invited Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to the White House in November .
Mazloum told Roebuck Thursday that `` I 've been holding myself for two days from going to the press and saying that America abandoned us and that I would like you to get out of our areas now so that I can invite Russian and regime planes to take over this airspace .

The United States does not need John Kerry ’ s possibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy on the very badly negotiated Iran Deal . He was the one that created this MESS in the first place ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) May 7 , 2018
Trump ’ s tweet comes after The Boston Globe reported last week that Kerry met Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif , who was Kerry 's counterpart when he served as secretary of State , to speak about how to protect the accord . The newspaper also said Kerry has met with other world leaders , including French President Emmanuel Macron and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier .
The effort runs up against Trump ’ s self-imposed May 12 deadline for the United States to decide whether it will exit the Obama-era agreement .

Trump’s tweet comes after The Boston Globe reported last week that Kerry met Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who was Kerry's counterpart when he served as secretary of State, to speak about how to protect the accord. The newspaper also said Kerry has met with other world leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.

The effort runs up against Trump’s self-imposed May 12 deadline for the United States to decide whether it will exit the Obama-era agreement.

Sands,"Donald Trump isn ’ t the only presidential front-runner this election cycle whose foreign policy views are sparking anger and unease in the rest of the world .
Despite — and in some cases because of — her four-year record as secretary of state , Democrat Hillary Clinton is coming in for a share of criticism from allies and adversaries alike , even if the level of vitriol doesn ’ t match some of the comments targeting her potential Republican rival for president .
The critiques aren ’ t always consistent . Some fear Mrs. Clinton represents a continuation of the Obama foreign policy that has fallen short , while others warn that on issues such as trade and the willingness to intervene militarily abroad she will break markedly with Mr. Obama .
“ While Trump ’ s foreign policy seems random and unpredictable ( he actually bragged about this ) , it ’ s hard to see how Clinton ’ s approach to war is much better , ” columnist and press freedom activist Trevor Timm wrote this week in the liberal British newspaper The Guardian .
Noting Mrs. Clinton ’ s support for the 2003 Iraq War and the 2012 Libya operation , Mr. Obama ’ s surge in Afghanistan and a proposed no-fly zone over Syria , “ her positions are often more militaristic than anyone else in the race , ” Mr. Timm wrote .
China ’ s official Xinhua News Agency this week carried a long analysis critical of Mrs. Clinton ’ s record of support for U.S. military intervention in the Middle East , saying there was little sign she would reverse course if elected president .
“ Clinton has proven several times that her decision-making is flawed , extremely flawed , ” Khaled Abdul-Jabbar , who teaches at Yemen ’ s Aden University , told Xinhua . “ If she really means it , then why is she still committed to intervening and trying to change regimes and the political process in some Arab countries ? ”
Chinese blogger Tian Ya Hai Jiao Ke wrote this month that Mrs. Clinton has a long record of rhetoric against China that plays well to her political base .
“ From Clinton ’ s perspective , the angrier [ Chinese officials ] get , the better , because her whole purpose in saying such things is to elicit a Chinese reaction in order to pander to the American people … , ” the blogger wrote . “ You must know that we don ’ t feel like Clinton ’ s continuous attacks against China are strange , because attacking China is her pet project . ”
Chinese critics note that Mrs. Clinton has spoken out for women ’ s rights in China and against Beijing ’ s aggressive push in the South China Sea , but some attacks have been unusually personal .
Chinese television host Sima Nan dismissed Mrs. Clinton as a “ crazy old woman , ” and a CNN report cited a comment on the popular Chinese social media platform Weibo : “ If she can ’ t manage her husband , how can she manage America ? ”
Mrs. Clinton ’ s break with President Obama on the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal blindsided many long-standing U.S. allies in the region . With Mr. Trump strongly denouncing existing U.S. trade pacts and the TPP , free trade forces in Asia say they have no champion in the White House race .
“ If both candidates are looking backward in the trade deal , how can the United States exert political leadership in the region ? ” an unidentified “ high-ranking official ” in the Japanese Foreign Ministry told The Japan Times .
Russia , which has welcomed Mr. Trump ’ s questioning of the NATO alliance and his professed willingness to work with President Vladimir Putin , may be one country where Mrs. Clinton is clearly not the first choice . The former first lady and senator is closely connected with the “ reset button ” on relations with Moscow early in her tenure as secretary of state , a policy that both sides now see as a failure .
Foreign affairs analyst Vladimir Mikheev , writing on the news site Russia Beyond the Headlines ( rbth.com ) , said Mr. Trump may not be able to reverse the anti-Russian bias of the American foreign policy establishment but “ Trump ’ s treatment of NATO as a costly enterprise with little benefit to the U.S. … is a welcome change of tune . ”
Arguing that Mrs. Clinton represents more of the same in U.S.-Russian relations , he said , “ There is a fair chance that America might change for the better under the billionaire businessman , with Trump possibly bringing into U.S. government bodies professionals with no links either to the ‘ missionaries ’ from the Democratic camp or the ‘ neoconservatives ’ from the Republican side . ”
In Israel , Mr. Obama ’ s prickly relations with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and questions about Mr. Obama ’ s nuclear deal with Iran are coloring perceptions of the U.S. presidential race . A TNS/Teleseker poll released Sunday found that a plurality of Israelis ( 42 percent ) think Mr. Netanyahu would get along better with Mr. Trump than with Mrs. Clinton . Just 32 percent said Mrs. Clinton could work better with the conservative Israeli leader .
Even so , 68 percent of Israelis say they view Mrs. Clinton favorably , compared with 43 percent for Mr. Trump .
Writing in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz , columnist Asher Schechter argued this year that , paradoxically , Mrs. Clinton would be bad for Israel because of her long record of unconditional support for the Jewish state .
“ For nearly 20 years , Clinton has never allowed herself to be truly critical of Israel , ” he wrote , “ despite Israel ’ s descent into an increasingly undemocratic ethnocracy . In that , she had enabled and even encouraged self-destructive behaviors and elements that have effectively killed the two-state solution , and are now threatening Israel ’ s security and democracy . ”
There is little question that European allies of the U.S. would tend to favor Mrs. Clinton , a known commodity , over the unpredictable Mr. Trump . But even there , some of Mrs. Clinton ’ s policies are causing unease .
As secretary of state , Mrs. Clinton was one of the architects of the Obama administration ’ s “ pivot to Asia , ” placing greater emphasis and assets on China and rising powers across East Asia at the expense of a traditional U.S. focus on Europe and the Middle East . Her 2011 article in Foreign Policy , “ America ’ s Pacific Century , ” is considered the blueprint for Mr. Obama ’ s overall diplomatic policy in the region .
Some in Europe fear the Continent ’ s importance in world affairs will only fall in a Clinton administration .
“ Some Brits and Europeans hope that the departure of President Obama might mean that the U.S. places less emphasis on Asia and pivots back to the Atlantic . That is unlikely , ” Financial Times columnist Gideon Rachman wrote this week .
“ Any U.S. president who looks at America ’ s strategic priorities is likely to come to conclusions similar to Mr. Obama ’ s . Hillary Clinton , his likeliest successor , is a firm believer in the ‘ pivot ’ to Asia . ”
Some voices overseas find Mrs. Clinton uninspiring as a world leader — until they consider the alternatives .
Noting her ethical troubles , high poll negatives and a “ largely wooden ” campaign style , John Kehoe , Washington correspondent for the Australian Financial Review , said Mrs. Clinton “ is very lucky to be in such a commanding position ” because of the weaknesses of her potential rivals this cycle .
“ She is more policy wonk than retail politician , ” Mr. Kehoe wrote . “ That may be a welcome change , given that politics has descended into any untidy 24/7 social media slanging match and policy reform has been painfully slow .

After President Barack Obama said he did n't yet have a strategy for ISIS in Syria , even a Democrat on Sunday criticized the President 's approach to fighting the extremist terror group .
There 's been the expected GOP criticism : Rep. Adam Kinzinger , R-Illinois , said the President 's statement was `` unfortunate , '' a predictable assessment from someone who disagrees with the Obama 's handling of foreign policy .
But more notable is Sen. Dianne Feinstein , the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee , who split with the leader of her party .

`` I think I 've learned one thing about this President and that is he 's very cautious . Maybe in this instance , too cautious , '' the California Democrat said on NBC 's `` Meet the Press . ''
Feinstein 's description comes as the Obama administration is implementing a split strategy in dealing with the group now calling itself the Islamic State .
In Iraq , where America recently concluded a long war there , the United States has continued airstrikes against ISIS , including strikes near Amerli Saturday . In Syria , meanwhile , the President has been reluctant to pursue military action as a complicated web of factions , including ISIS , is fighting to defeat President Bashar al-Assad , also a U.S. opponent .
While members of both parties indicated that Syria is the most dangerous country in the world right now as it is considered ISIS ' home base , Republicans differed from Democrats in that they insisted that the threat ISIS poses to the U.S. is immediate . `` I believe strongly that ISIS does plan on attacking the United States , '' Rep. Peter King said on `` Fox News Sunday . ''
Sen. John McCain went even further on CBS News ' `` Face the Nation '' : `` I think it starts with an understanding that this is a direct threat to the United States of America , that it may be one of the biggest we have ever faced . ''
But the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee , Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland , played down the immediacy of a direct attack in the United States on CNN 's `` State of the Union , '' saying strong intelligence `` at this point '' of an imminent attack on the U.S. does not exist .
Another Democrat , Rep. Adam Smith of Washington , acknowledged the threat ISIS poses is real , but it 's `` a bit of an overstatement '' to compare the threat of ISIS to al Qaeda .
`` There is no evidence at this point that they are actually doing the sort of command-and-control plotting , planning specific attacks against Western targets , like al Qaeda was , gosh , for better -- for almost a decade before 9/11 , '' he said on `` Face the Nation . ''
Kinzinger used a cancer analogy describing ISIS , expanding upon an opinion piece written by Secretary of State John Kerry in The New York Times Friday when he said `` the cancer of ISIS will not be allowed to spread to other countries . ''
`` If you have cancer in your liver , and it 's spreading to other parts of your body , you do n't just treat the other parts , you treat the liver , '' the Iraq War veteran said on CNN 's `` State the Union . '' `` The liver is Syria . ''

While the President has been taking heat for saying he does n't have a strategy for ISIS , a Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee discussed the challenges in formulating a strategy , in part , because obtaining intelligence about ISIS from war-torn Syria has been difficult .
`` We ca n't simply bomb first and ask questions later . We have to have the right targets and the right support in order to be effective in stopping ISIS , '' he said on CBS News ' `` Face the Nation . ''
On Friday , Rep. Joe Courtney , D-Connecticut , and others sent a letter to House Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon , asking that committee members return to Washington ahead of schedule in order to oversee Obama 's response to ISIS and the possible expansion of airstrikes .
`` We are very concerned that due to the speed with which events are happening , waiting until September 8th for Congress to reconvene effectively sidelines our constitutional role . We respectfully request that the Armed Services Committee reconvene as early as possible to provide the needed oversight over this new development , '' they wrote .
In response , a spokesman for McKeon said the chairman appreciates the sense of urgency and that oversight can take a variety of forms .
`` Currently the chairman and other members of the committee are traveling in the Middle East , consulting regional leaders on this important issue . A classified briefing for committee members -- covering ISIS as well as the events in the Ukraine -- is scheduled for the Tuesday members return , '' said Claude Chafin .
Most Republicans , including McCain , are urging immediate airstrikes in Syria , the place where the terrorist group gained traction with its brutal tactics and mostly erasing the border between the Syria and Iraq .
The Arizona Republican joined Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina , who opened the door last week to putting more U.S. troops in Iraq . McCain said that a comprehensive strategy to defeating ISIS `` is going to require some more special forces . ''
Ruppersberger was among the Democrats who urged a broad strategic plan that leaves the door open for a variety of actions , which is the message put out by the Obama administration over the past two days , including in Kerry 's opinion piece .
`` If we need to go ... to protect ourselves from ISIS , we will , but it 's got to be a coalition , '' Ruppersberger said on `` State of the Union . ''
Democrats insisted that building an international coalition in the region and beyond is the first step .
`` We have to build that coalition , '' Smith said . `` We need reliable partners to work with in the region . ''
But Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan , the Republican head of the House Intelligence Committee , said the President should have been building that coalition for the past year .
`` It 's just very , very late in the game and it presents fewer options , '' Rogers said on `` Fox News Sunday . ''","Story highlights Rep. Joe Courtney and others call for the Armed Services Committee to reconvene

But more notable is Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, who split with the leader of her party.

""I think I've learned one thing about this President and that is he's very cautious. Maybe in this instance, too cautious,"" the California Democrat said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

Feinstein's description comes as the Obama administration is implementing a split strategy in dealing with the group now calling itself the Islamic State.

In Iraq, where America recently concluded a long war there, the United States has continued airstrikes against ISIS, including strikes near Amerli Saturday . In Syria, meanwhile, the President has been reluctant to pursue military action as a complicated web of factions, including ISIS, is fighting to defeat President Bashar al-Assad, also a U.S. opponent.

The threat

While members of both parties indicated that Syria is the most dangerous country in the world right now as it is considered ISIS' home base, Republicans differed from Democrats in that they insisted that the threat ISIS poses to the U.S. is immediate. ""I believe strongly that ISIS does plan on attacking the United States,"" Rep. Peter King said on ""Fox News Sunday.""

Sen. John McCain went even further on CBS News' ""Face the Nation"": ""I think it starts with an understanding that this is a direct threat to the United States of America, that it may be one of the biggest we have ever faced.""

But the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, played down the immediacy of a direct attack in the United States on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" saying strong intelligence ""at this point"" of an imminent attack on the U.S. does not exist.

Another Democrat, Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, acknowledged the threat ISIS poses is real, but it's ""a bit of an overstatement"" to compare the threat of ISIS to al Qaeda.

""There is no evidence at this point that they are actually doing the sort of command-and-control plotting, planning specific attacks against Western targets, like al Qaeda was, gosh, for better -- for almost a decade before 9/11,"" he said on ""Face the Nation.""

'A cancer'

Kinzinger used a cancer analogy describing ISIS, expanding upon an opinion piece written by Secretary of State John Kerry in The New York Times Friday when he said ""the cancer of ISIS will not be allowed to spread to other countries.""

""If you have cancer in your liver, and it's spreading to other parts of your body, you don't just treat the other parts, you treat the liver,"" the Iraq War veteran said on CNN's ""State the Union."" ""The liver is Syria.""

While the President has been taking heat for saying he doesn't have a strategy for ISIS, a Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee discussed the challenges in formulating a strategy, in part, because obtaining intelligence about ISIS from war-torn Syria has been difficult.

""We have got to get the intelligence,"" Ruppersberger said.

Smith echoed his colleague's sentiment.

""We can't simply bomb first and ask questions later. We have to have the right targets and the right support in order to be effective in stopping ISIS,"" he said on CBS News' ""Face the Nation.""

On Friday, Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Connecticut, and others sent a letter to House Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon, asking that committee members return to Washington ahead of schedule in order to oversee Obama's response to ISIS and the possible expansion of airstrikes.

""We are very concerned that due to the speed with which events are happening, waiting until September 8th for Congress to reconvene effectively sidelines our constitutional role. We respectfully request that the Armed Services Committee reconvene as early as possible to provide the needed oversight over this new development,"" they wrote.

In response, a spokesman for McKeon said the chairman appreciates the sense of urgency and that oversight can take a variety of forms.

""Currently the chairman and other members of the committee are traveling in the Middle East, consulting regional leaders on this important issue. A classified briefing for committee members -- covering ISIS as well as the events in the Ukraine -- is scheduled for the Tuesday members return,"" said Claude Chafin.

Military action now -- or soon

Most Republicans, including McCain, are urging immediate airstrikes in Syria, the place where the terrorist group gained traction with its brutal tactics and mostly erasing the border between the Syria and Iraq.

The Arizona Republican joined Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who opened the door last week to putting more U.S. troops in Iraq. McCain said that a comprehensive strategy to defeating ISIS ""is going to require some more special forces.""

Ruppersberger was among the Democrats who urged a broad strategic plan that leaves the door open for a variety of actions, which is the message put out by the Obama administration over the past two days, including in Kerry's opinion piece.

""If we need to go ... to protect ourselves from ISIS, we will, but it's got to be a coalition,"" Ruppersberger said on ""State of the Union.""

Democrats insisted that building an international coalition in the region and beyond is the first step.

""We have to build that coalition,"" Smith said. ""We need reliable partners to work with in the region.""

But Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan, the Republican head of the House Intelligence Committee, said the President should have been building that coalition for the past year.

""It's just very, very late in the game and it presents fewer options,"" Rogers said on ""Fox News Sunday.""",www.cnn.com,left,qSWP3COAqRpNDfQC

foreign_policy,Reason,2,http://reason.com/blog/2017/05/26/4th-circuit-exaggerates-the-ambiguous-ev,4th Circuit Exaggerates the Ambiguous Evidence Against Trump's Travel Ban,2017-05-26,"Jacob Sullum, Veronique De Rugy, Jim Lindgren, Brian Doherty, Ronald Bailey, Eric Boehm, Christian Britschgi, Cosmo Wenman, Joe Setyon","Yesterday the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit upheld a preliminary injunction against President Trump 's revised travel ban , concluding that the facially neutral executive order probably amounts to an unconstitutional `` establishment of religion '' because it was motivated primarily by anti-Muslim sentiment . The order `` in text speaks with vague words of national security , '' says the majority opinion by Chief Judge Roger Gregory , `` but in context drips with religious intolerance , animus , and discrimination . '' That context is much more ambiguous than Gregory suggests .
Ten judges , all appointed by Democrats , agreed that the injunction should stand . The three dissenting judges , all Republican appointees , argue that the majority improperly went beyond the text of the order , which suspends travel to the United States by citizens of six Muslim-majority countries , to consider statements made by Trump and his associates during and after his presidential campaign . `` The danger of the majority 's new rule is that it will enable any court to justify its decision to strike down any executive action with which it disagrees , '' says the dissent by Judge Paul Niemeyer . `` It need only find one statement that contradicts the stated reasons for a subsequent executive action and thereby pronounce that reasons for the executive action are a pretext . ''
I find myself disagreeing with both sides in this case , which was brought by six U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents with relatives in the targeted countries and three organizations that serve Muslims who want to visit or live in the United States . Niemeyer exaggerates the danger of considering a president 's public statements about his own policies , while Gregory exaggerates the strength of the evidence provided by those statements .
The president has broad authority to decide which foreign nationals may enter the country . The Supreme Court has said an executive-branch decision to exclude a would-be visitor or immigrant should be upheld as long as it is based on `` a facially legitimate and bona fide ███ . '' The 4th Circuit reads `` facially '' as modifying `` legitimate '' but not `` bona fide . '' Although Trump 's travel ban is facially legitimate , the majority says , it is not bona fide , because there 's `` ample evidence '' that Trump acted in `` bad faith , '' that the national security rationale is a cover for religious discrimination . The dissenters read `` facially '' as modifying `` bona fide '' as well as `` legitimate , '' meaning the courts have no business considering the evidence that the majority finds persuasive .
Either way , it seems unlikely that the plaintiffs will prevail when this case gets to the Supreme Court . Even if the justices agree to look beyond the text of the order , the evidence cited by the 4th Circuit is not enough to establish either that the ███ for Trump 's order is not bona fide or that the travel ban unconstitutionally discriminates against Muslims ( two propositions that amount to essentially the same thing in the appeals court 's analysis ) .
As a presidential candidate , Trump openly and repeatedly recommended `` a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States , '' suggesting that `` Islam hates us '' and `` we ca n't allow people coming into the country who have this hatred . '' According to the plaintiffs challenging the travel ban , Trump never really abandoned the idea of using religion to screen travelers . Instead he recast his ban based on religion as a ban based on national origin , at first vaguely referring to countries `` compromised by terrorism '' and eventually focusing on six ( Iran , Libya , Somalia , Sudan , Syria , and Yemen ) . The executive order says these countries are particularly problematic because they sponsor terrorism or provide havens for terrorists and lack adquate vetting procedures for travelers . But the plaintiffs argue that as far as Trump is concerned , the most salient characteristic of these countries is that their populations are overwhelmingly Muslim .
That story is consistent with the public statements cited by the 4th Circuit . But so is another story : Trump reconsidered his rash campaign rhetoric and settled on a narrower , more defensible approach . The same statements that Trump 's critics cite as evidence of subterfuge—e.g. , `` I 'm talking territory instead of Muslim '' or `` The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a [ n ] extreme vetting from certain areas of the world '' —can also be seen as evidence of substantive evolution in his position . After Trump 's first executive order was blocked by the courts , he narrowed his policy further , clarifying that the travel ban does not apply to legal permanent residents or current visa holders , cutting the list of countries from seven to six , eliminating an indefinite ban on refugees from Syria , and striking a preference for refugees facing religious persecution .
As Niemeyer observes , `` a candidate might have different intentions than a President in office . '' There is a big difference between the `` Muslim ban '' that Trump originally described and the policy he is currently defending , which has no religious criteria and does not cover the vast majority of Muslims ( although the vast majority of people it covers are Muslims ) . In fact , Niemeyer notes , the plaintiffs conceded that if Hillary Clinton had been elected president and issued exactly the same executive order , it `` could be constitutional . '' The question is whether Trump 's past expressions of prejudice against Muslims preclude him from implementing a policy his opponent would have been free to adopt .
That policy may not make much sense , it may be both overinclusive and underinclusive , and it may not prevent a single terrorist attack . It may even be crafted more to create the appearance of making Americans safer than to actually reduce their already tiny odds of being killed by terrorists . But none of that means Trump 's order lacks a secular purpose , which is the proposition that the 4th Circuit says the plaintiffs probably can prove .
`` The government must show that the challenged action 's primary purpose is secular , '' Gregory writes . But that cuts both ways . Even if Trump 's thinking about national security is influenced by anti-Muslim bigotry , it seems unlikely that discomfiting Muslims , as opposed to looking tough on terrorism , was his primary purpose in issuing the travel ban . Neither motive is admirable , but only one is illegal .","Yesterday the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit upheld a preliminary injunction against President Trump's revised travel ban, concluding that the facially neutral executive order probably amounts to an unconstitutional ""establishment of religion"" because it was motivated primarily by anti-Muslim sentiment.

The three dissenting judges, all Republican appointees, argue that the majority improperly went beyond the text of the order, which suspends travel to the United States by citizens of six Muslim-majority countries, to consider statements made by Trump and his associates during and after his presidential campaign. ""The danger of the majority's new rule is that it will enable any court to justify its decision to strike down any executive action with which it disagrees,"" says the dissent by Judge Paul Niemeyer. ""It need only find one statement that contradicts the stated reasons for a subsequent executive action and thereby pronounce that reasons for the executive action are a pretext.""

I find myself disagreeing with both sides in this case, which was brought by six U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents with relatives in the targeted countries and three organizations that serve Muslims who want to visit or live in the United States. Niemeyer exaggerates the danger of considering a president's public statements about his own policies, while Gregory exaggerates the strength of the evidence provided by those statements.

The president has broad authority to decide which foreign nationals may enter the country. The Supreme Court has said an executive-branch decision to exclude a would-be visitor or immigrant should be upheld as long as it is based on ""a facially legitimate and bona fide reason."" The 4th Circuit reads ""facially"" as modifying ""legitimate"" but not ""bona fide."" Although Trump's travel ban is facially legitimate, the majority says, it is not bona fide, because there's ""ample evidence"" that Trump acted in ""bad faith,"" that the national security rationale is a cover for religious discrimination. The dissenters read ""facially"" as modifying ""bona fide"" as well as ""legitimate,"" meaning the courts have no business considering the evidence that the majority finds persuasive.

Either way, it seems unlikely that the plaintiffs will prevail when this case gets to the Supreme Court. Even if the justices agree to look beyond the text of the order, the evidence cited by the 4th Circuit is not enough to establish either that the reason for Trump's order is not bona fide or that the travel ban unconstitutionally discriminates against Muslims (two propositions that amount to essentially the same thing in the appeals court's analysis).

As a presidential candidate, Trump openly and repeatedly recommended ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,"" suggesting that ""Islam hates us"" and ""we can't allow people coming into the country who have this hatred."" According to the plaintiffs challenging the travel ban, Trump never really abandoned the idea of using religion to screen travelers. Instead he recast his ban based on religion as a ban based on national origin, at first vaguely referring to countries ""compromised by terrorism"" and eventually focusing on six (Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen). The executive order says these countries are particularly problematic because they sponsor terrorism or provide havens for terrorists and lack adquate vetting procedures for travelers. But the plaintiffs argue that as far as Trump is concerned, the most salient characteristic of these countries is that their populations are overwhelmingly Muslim.

That story is consistent with the public statements cited by the 4th Circuit. But so is another story: Trump reconsidered his rash campaign rhetoric and settled on a narrower, more defensible approach. The same statements that Trump's critics cite as evidence of subterfuge—e.g., ""I'm talking territory instead of Muslim"" or ""The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a[n] extreme vetting from certain areas of the world""—can also be seen as evidence of substantive evolution in his position. After Trump's first executive order was blocked by the courts, he narrowed his policy further, clarifying that the travel ban does not apply to legal permanent residents or current visa holders, cutting the list of countries from seven to six, eliminating an indefinite ban on refugees from Syria, and striking a preference for refugees facing religious persecution.

As Niemeyer observes, ""a candidate might have different intentions than a President in office."" There is a big difference between the ""Muslim ban"" that Trump originally described and the policy he is currently defending, which has no religious criteria and does not cover the vast majority of Muslims (although the vast majority of people it covers are Muslims). In fact, Niemeyer notes, the plaintiffs conceded that if Hillary Clinton had been elected president and issued exactly the same executive order, it ""could be constitutional."" The question is whether Trump's past expressions of prejudice against Muslims preclude him from implementing a policy his opponent would have been free to adopt.

That policy may not make much sense, it may be both overinclusive and underinclusive, and it may not prevent a single terrorist attack. It may even be crafted more to create the appearance of making Americans safer than to actually reduce their already tiny odds of being killed by terrorists. But none of that means Trump's order lacks a secular purpose, which is the proposition that the 4th Circuit says the plaintiffs probably can prove.

""The government must show that the challenged action's primary purpose is secular,"" Gregory writes. But that cuts both ways. Even if Trump's thinking about national security is influenced by anti-Muslim bigotry, it seems unlikely that discomfiting Muslims, as opposed to looking tough on terrorism, was his primary purpose in issuing the travel ban. Neither motive is admirable, but only one is illegal.",www.reason.com,right,0ONRKTQHcKu6IuaE

WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump faced blowback from fellow Republicans this week for a plan – later scuttled – to use Camp David for negotiations with the Taliban.

The meeting, had it occurred, would have delivered the kind of drama that appeals to Trump, a former TV star. But it wouldn’t have been the first time the sprawling retreat, tucked into a mountainous national park in Maryland, has been used for high-stakes diplomacy.

Built by Depression-era Works Progress Administration workers in the 1930s, the secluded camp has been used by past presidents to meet with world leaders attempting to sort out thorny issues from Middle East tensions to the Cold War.

Trump drew fire from lawmakers, including Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyoming, who expressed outrage over the idea of granting the Taliban the prestige of a meeting at the presidential retreat, especially so close to the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.

Cheney noted that Camp David was where President George W. Bush assembled his senior advisers and Cabinet officials to deliberate the response to the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The Bush administration blamed the Taliban for harboring al Qaeda, including Osama bin Laden, and went to war to oust it from power in Afghanistan.

“Camp David is where America’s leaders met to plan our response after al Qaeda, supported by the Taliban, killed 3000 Americans on 9/11,” Cheney posted on Twitter. “No member of the Taliban should set foot there. Ever.”

Trump defended the move this week.

""Camp David's held meetings with a lot of people that would have been perceived as being pretty tough customers,"" Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday. ""There have been plenty of so-called bad people brought up to Camp David for meetings.""

Here’s a look at past high-stakes meetings that have taken place at Camp David:

Roosevelt's Shangri-La

It was President Franklin Delano Roosevelt who converted the facility into a presidential retreat, renaming it Shangri-La. Roosevelt hosted British Prime Minister Winston Churchill there in 1943 as Germany was pushing across Europe during World War II.

Nearly a year later, the U.S. would play a central role in the D-Day invasion that changed the course of the war.

The Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum holds a photograph of the two leaders fishing at the retreat, with Roosevelt holding a fly rod and Churchill his trademark cigar.

Cold War tensions

President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who named the retreat Camp David after his father and grandson, met with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev there in 1959. At a point of high Cold War tension, the two leaders made some progress, such as agreeing to open talks on the administration of war-torn Berlin. But much of the good will was scuttled when an American U-2 spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union months later.

Middle East talks

Perhaps the most famous international gathering to take place at Camp David happened under President Jimmy Carter. The president brought Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to the site in 1978, forcing two leaders who had little trust for each other to sit down to broker a peace accord named for the retreat.

The touch-and-go negotiations took place over 12 days – all of it in secret.

President Bill Clinton attempted to recreate the sense of momentum in the Middle East with his own summit in 2000 but Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority leader Yasser Arafat failed to reach an agreement.

G-8 meeting

Eisenhower wasn’t the only president to host Russians at Camp David. President George W. Bush hosted Vladimir Putin in 2003. President Barack Obama held a G8 summit at Camp David in 2012, when the Russians were still part of the group of the world’s most industrialized economies.

Senior administration officials have asked Senate Democrats to notify the White House if they are considering signing onto a bill drafted by Sens . Bob Corker ( R-Tenn. ) and Robert Menendez ( D-N.J. ) that would give Congress the ability to accept or reject any nuclear deal . The push , several Senate sources said , is to prevent a veto-proof majority from building by heading off any fresh Democratic support for the plan and persuade supporters to keep their powder dry until the conclusion of multilateral negotiations with Iran .
The lobbying effort has come from all quarters . Obama has spoken directly with Democratic senators on the Foreign Relations Committee , including Ben Cardin of Maryland . Other senators who are weighing whether to join the legislative effort , such as Joe Manchin of West Virginia , have been briefed by the likes of Samantha Power , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations . Vice President Joe Biden , Secretary of State John Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew have reached out directly to senators , according to sources on Capitol Hill .
And the White House chief of staff , Denis McDonough , warned lawmakers bluntly in a Saturday night letter not to interfere before a tentative deal is reached this month and the final terms are inked in late June .
All told , senators said , it amounted to a White House moving with dispatch to limit Democratic dissension in the face of a growing revolt from Congress .
“ I would call it serious-minded , ” said Maine Sen. Angus King , an independent who caucuses with Democrats and has discussed the Corker-Menendez bill with administration officials in recent days . He has co-sponsored the plan but has not said how he would vote if the measure heads to the floor imminently . “ I think they are concerned . ”
With their caucus divided , Senate Democratic leaders are letting the White House mount the lobbying push on its own . Asked Tuesday whether he was encouraging his members to oppose the Corker-Menendez bill , Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said flatly , “ No . ”
With virtually all 54 Republicans expected to back the bill , and 11 Senate Democratic Caucus members signaling their support , the White House has little margin for error in heading off a veto-proof majority .
White House officials declined to comment . But they pointed to the McDonough letter , which showcased the administration ’ s thinking on Hill action as negotiations intensify between six world powers and Iran aimed at alleviating sanctions on the Middle East nation in exchange for curbing its nuclear program . The White House says there have been more than 100 meetings , hearings , briefings and calls with lawmakers on the matter since January .
In the letter to Corker on Saturday , McDonough reiterated Obama ’ s veto threats for the bipartisan legislation and urged Congress to hit the pause button until the final deal with Iran is reached . That could stretch into the summer after this month ’ s deadline to sign off on the outlines of a plan . McDonough said plainly that moving on Corker ’ s bill while any stage of the negotiations is ongoing would not serve “ the country ’ s interests . ”
“ Let us complete the negotiations before the Congress acts on legislation , ” McDonough wrote . “ If we successfully negotiate a framework by the end of this month , and a final deal by the end of June , we expect a robust debate in Congress . ”
Corker , chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , is frustrated by the White House ’ s handling of the issue . He said Tuesday he remained “ fairly ” confident that his committee will vote on the Iran bill next week , coinciding with the March 24 deadline Democratic supporters of the bill have set before pushing forward . Detractors worry that a bad deal would only pave the way for Iran to build a nuclear bomb .
“ They ’ re using every tactic available to try to keep Congress from playing its rightful role on Iran , ” Corker said of the White House . “ We ’ ve delayed the vote to accommodate people ’ s desire to let the 24th come and go . But I think we ’ re at a place now where we need to go ahead and move it through committee . ”
That timeline would give Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) the ability to begin debate on Corker ’ s bill by perhaps mid-April , when the Senate reconvenes after Easter recess . But symbolic votes on Iran could take place on the floor next week when the Senate takes up its annual budget resolution .
While Menendez is a co-sponsor of the bill , he has said Congress should hold off acting until after the March 24 deadline . Whether he would wait until June is another question .
“ As I said , we ’ re going to wait until the 24th , which was their deadline originally , and then we will come to a conclusion , ” Menendez , the committee ’ s ranking member , said when asked about holding off until June .
Asked if he would commit to voting for the plan in the Foreign Relations Committee next week , Menendez would say only that he ’ s “ talking to the chairman about it . ”
But the White House whipping operation is causing some Democratic senators to have second thoughts about whether to support Corker ’ s bill in committee next week or in April , when Senate leaders hope to bring the bill to the Senate floor .
“ What I got from the president is he needs the latitude to be able to negotiate , which I support . And this could impact his ability to negotiate , ” said Cardin , who would not commit to voting for Corker ’ s bill even after March 24 . “ I want to give the president every opportunity , but I do think we have certain responsibilities in Congress . ”
Sen. Bill Nelson ( D-Fla. ) , who also co-sponsored the bill , said that it was “ preferable ” that Congress wait until after June to weigh in , but he wouldn ’ t say how he would vote before then .
“ I ’ m talking to the White House almost every day about this . I think their antenna is up , ” said Sen. Chris Murphy ( D-Conn. ) , a member of the Foreign Relations Committee . “ My hope is their high level of activity this week is going to move the needle and persuade us to unite behind the president . ”
But others are less concerned with the timing of congressional action , demanding instead that they get the bill ready so Capitol Hill has a vehicle for expressing its support or opposition to an Iran deal . The bill would also prohibit the president from suspending congressional sanctions on Iran for 60 days while Congress reviews the deal . And it would require that Obama report on Iran ’ s compliance with the deal every three months .
Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia , another Foreign Relations Committee member , did not appear eager to heed the White House ’ s request to wait until June .
“ Last Thursday , I talked to a key administration official who said , ‘ I hope you ’ re going to wait at least until the end of March. ’ Then it sounded like it ’ s kind of till the end of the June , ” Kaine said . “ Look , Congress is going to weigh in . … I don ’ t think the timing issue is that critical . ”
King added : “ I talked to [ the White House ] . I ’ m still listening . I thought the McDonough letter was well written and thoughtful , but right now I continue to believe having a congressional role is responsible . ”
Others are also ready to buck the administration . Sen. Richard Blumenthal , a liberal Democrat , said he was asking for changes to the Corker-Menendez bill before he “ probably ” will sign onto it .
“ Iran is at the table now because of sanctions that Congress has firmly pressed , ” said Blumenthal , who has spoken to a “ variety ” of administration officials in recent weeks . “ The principle of congressional review and the Senate ’ s role is an important principle that should be established from the outset . ”
Still , the White House lobbying effort seems to have persuaded other Democrats not to break ranks . Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire , who sits on the Foreign Relations Committee , said she opposes moving forward on the matter in committee next week .
“ The conversations that I had were about where they are in the negotiations , what currently the sticking points are , how they ’ re feeling about potential progress , ” Shaheen said of her discussions with the administration . “ I want to see if we get an agreement , what might be in that kind of agreement and then make a decision at that point . ”","The White House is moving aggressively to limit Democratic defections on Capitol Hill that could undermine its negotiations with Iran, dispatching senior officials and President Barack Obama himself to lobby senators against taking action before a nuclear deal with the rogue regime is reached.

foreign_policy,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jul/7/donald-trump-encounters-vladimir-putin-1st-time-g-/,Grins and handshakes as Trump encounters Putin for 1st time at G-20,2017-07-07,S.A. Miller,"With a hearty handshake and broad smiles , President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin greeted each other face-to-face for the first time Friday at the G-20 summit in Hamburg , Germany .
The two leaders will sit down together later Friday for a highly anticipated meeting overshadowed by Russia ’ s interference in the U.S. presidential election last year and Democrats ’ unsubstantiated allegations of Trump campaign collusion .
When the two leaders greeted each with a handshake at the G-20 gathering , Mr. Trump reached across with his left hand to pat Mr. Putin ’ s elbow during the handshake . The image went viral .
While the sit-down on the G-20 sidelines is their first face-to-face encounter , they have spoken by phone three times since Mr. Trump took office , according to the White House .
The White House said there was not set agenda for the meeting . Likely topics for the meeting include the election meddling , the Syria civil war in which the U.S. and Russia support opposing sides , Russia ’ s annexation of Crimea , and the fight against the Islamic State group and radical Islamic terrorism .
“ Much to discuss , ” Trump tweeted in advance of the meeting .
Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin will be joined at the meeting by U.S. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov , said the White House .
U.S. lawmakers and federal investigators continue to look into Russia ’ s election interference , along with possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russian government officials . That puts Mr. Trump under intense scrutiny over how he handles the sit-down with Mr. Putin , a former Russian intelligence agent .
Heading into the meeting , Mr. Trump sharpened the lines of division between Washington and Moscow , criticizing Russia ’ s military actions in Ukraine and Syria and praising NATO for its vital role in defending Europe against aggression .
Mr. Trump , who likes to have neatly packaged achievements to pair with high-profile meetings , may seek some concessions from Russia to show he ’ s delivering progress and helping restore a once-productive relationship that he recently described as being at an “ all-time low . ”
The list of issues ranges from Syria to Iran to Ukraine , and now North Korea , following Pyongyang ’ s test this week of a missile capable of striking the U.S .
Russia wants the U.S. to return the two compounds in New York and Maryland that were seized by the Obama administration as punishment for election meddling . It also wants the U.S. to ease sanctions it imposed on Russia after Mr. Putin annexed the Crimean Peninsula , and over Russia ’ s support of separatist elements in Ukraine .
The U.S. wants a resumption of adoptions of Russian children by American parents , which Russia banned in 2012 , along with an end to what it claims is intensifying harassment of U.S. diplomats and other officials stationed in Russia .
Lawmakers in both political parties say Mr. Trump must confront Mr. Putin over the election .
Several senior Democratic U.S. senators served notice Thursday that Trump would be in “ severe dereliction ” of his presidential duty if he fails to confront Mr. Putin over the issue , telling Mr. Trump in a letter that he must make clear that Russia ’ s interference in U.S. democracy will not be tolerated .
“ The upcoming elections can not be a playground for President Putin , ” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck E. Schumer of New York ; Dick Durbin of Illinois , the Senate ’ s No . 2 Democrat ; and the top Democrats on the Intelligence , Armed Services , and Foreign Relations committees .
Rep. Adam Kinzinger , Illinois Republican and a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , said this week that he will “ raise holy hell ” if Mr. Trump goes soft on Mr. Putin .
“ It is very important for us to make a statement that Russia does not meddle not just in our elections , here and the future , but in our allies , ” Mr. Kinzinger said .
Every detail of the Trump-Putin meeting will be scrutinized , from their facial expressions to the color of their neckties to how they shake hands .
“ The big thing to watch will be what Mr. Putin asks for and what he offers in return and whether there ’ s a sense of receptivity on the president ’ s part , ” said Derek Chollet , executive vice president and senior adviser for security and defense policy at the German Marshall Fund , a Washington think tank .
Before meeting with Mr. Putin , Mr. Trump will try to manage another rocky international relationship when he meets with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto .
Mr. Pena Nieto had been scheduled to visit the White House shortly after Mr. Trump took office , but he scrapped the trip at the last minute due to disagreement with Mr. Trump over the U.S. president ’ s insistence that Mexico pay for the wall he has vowed to build along the U.S.-Mexico border to deter illegal immigration .
Mr. Trump has vowed to tighten border security and crack down on undocumented workers and drug cartels , but he has been less firm on getting Mexico to pay for the wall .
He reassured Mr. Pena Nieto in April that he would not pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement , which involves the U.S. , Mexico and Canada . But Mr. Trump said he could still withdraw if he concludes that a renegotiated pact would not produce “ a fair deal ” for all sides .

• This article is based in part on wire service reports .","With a hearty handshake and broad smiles, President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin greeted each other face-to-face for the first time Friday at the G-20 summit in Hamburg, Germany.

The two leaders will sit down together later Friday for a highly anticipated meeting overshadowed by Russia’s interference in the U.S. presidential election last year and Democrats’ unsubstantiated allegations of Trump campaign collusion.

When the two leaders greeted each with a handshake at the G-20 gathering, Mr. Trump reached across with his left hand to pat Mr. Putin’s elbow during the handshake. The image went viral.

While the sit-down on the G-20 sidelines is their first face-to-face encounter, they have spoken by phone three times since Mr. Trump took office, according to the White House.

The White House said there was not set agenda for the meeting. Likely topics for the meeting include the election meddling, the Syria civil war in which the U.S. and Russia support opposing sides, Russia’s annexation of Crimea, and the fight against the Islamic State group and radical Islamic terrorism.

“Much to discuss,” Trump tweeted in advance of the meeting.

Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin will be joined at the meeting by U.S. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, said the White House.

U.S. lawmakers and federal investigators continue to look into Russia’s election interference, along with possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russian government officials. That puts Mr. Trump under intense scrutiny over how he handles the sit-down with Mr. Putin, a former Russian intelligence agent.

Heading into the meeting, Mr. Trump sharpened the lines of division between Washington and Moscow, criticizing Russia’s military actions in Ukraine and Syria and praising NATO for its vital role in defending Europe against aggression.

Mr. Trump, who likes to have neatly packaged achievements to pair with high-profile meetings, may seek some concessions from Russia to show he’s delivering progress and helping restore a once-productive relationship that he recently described as being at an “all-time low.”

Mr. Putin would almost certainly want something in return.

The list of issues ranges from Syria to Iran to Ukraine, and now North Korea, following Pyongyang’s test this week of a missile capable of striking the U.S.

Russia wants the U.S. to return the two compounds in New York and Maryland that were seized by the Obama administration as punishment for election meddling. It also wants the U.S. to ease sanctions it imposed on Russia after Mr. Putin annexed the Crimean Peninsula, and over Russia’s support of separatist elements in Ukraine.

The U.S. wants a resumption of adoptions of Russian children by American parents, which Russia banned in 2012, along with an end to what it claims is intensifying harassment of U.S. diplomats and other officials stationed in Russia.

Lawmakers in both political parties say Mr. Trump must confront Mr. Putin over the election.

Several senior Democratic U.S. senators served notice Thursday that Trump would be in “severe dereliction” of his presidential duty if he fails to confront Mr. Putin over the issue, telling Mr. Trump in a letter that he must make clear that Russia’s interference in U.S. democracy will not be tolerated.

“The upcoming elections cannot be a playground for President Putin,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck E. Schumer of New York; Dick Durbin of Illinois, the Senate’s No. 2 Democrat; and the top Democrats on the Intelligence, Armed Services, and Foreign Relations committees.

Rep. Adam Kinzinger, Illinois Republican and a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said this week that he will “raise holy hell” if Mr. Trump goes soft on Mr. Putin.

“It is very important for us to make a statement that Russia does not meddle not just in our elections, here and the future, but in our allies,” Mr. Kinzinger said.

Every detail of the Trump-Putin meeting will be scrutinized, from their facial expressions to the color of their neckties to how they shake hands.

“The big thing to watch will be what Mr. Putin asks for and what he offers in return and whether there’s a sense of receptivity on the president’s part,” said Derek Chollet, executive vice president and senior adviser for security and defense policy at the German Marshall Fund, a Washington think tank.

Before meeting with Mr. Putin, Mr. Trump will try to manage another rocky international relationship when he meets with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto.

Mr. Pena Nieto had been scheduled to visit the White House shortly after Mr. Trump took office, but he scrapped the trip at the last minute due to disagreement with Mr. Trump over the U.S. president’s insistence that Mexico pay for the wall he has vowed to build along the U.S.-Mexico border to deter illegal immigration.

Mr. Pena Nieto insists Mexico will not pay.

Mr. Trump has vowed to tighten border security and crack down on undocumented workers and drug cartels, but he has been less firm on getting Mexico to pay for the wall.

He reassured Mr. Pena Nieto in April that he would not pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which involves the U.S., Mexico and Canada. But Mr. Trump said he could still withdraw if he concludes that a renegotiated pact would not produce “a fair deal” for all sides.

The Putin meeting is the highlight of a hectic, four-day European visit for Mr. Trump, who addressed thousands of Poles in an outdoor speech in Warsaw, Poland, on Thursday. He met in Germany with Chancellor Angela Merkel, the summit host, and had dinner with two Asian allies — Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President Moon Jae-in — to discuss North Korea’s aggression.

The Group of 20 gathering of the world’s leading rich and developing nations is the first since Mr. Trump announced that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, deeply disappointing Merkel and other U.S. allies who had hoped to maintain momentum in battling climate change. Even as Mr. Trump has said in vague terms he would like to renegotiate the Paris accord, European leaders have vowed to press forward.

This account , described to ███ by three officials familiar with the meetings and a fourth close to Iran ’ s decision making , is the first to describe the role of Iran ’ s leaders in plotting the Sept. 14 attack on Saudi Aramco , Saudi Arabia ’ s state-controlled oil company .
These people said Iran ’ s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei approved the operation , but with strict conditions : Iranian forces must avoid hitting any civilians or Americans .
███ was unable to confirm their version of events with Iran ’ s leadership . A Revolutionary Guards spokesman declined to comment . Tehran has steadfastly denied involvement .
Alireza Miryousefi , spokesman for the Iranian Mission to the United Nations in New York , rejected the version of events the four people described to ███ . He said Iran played no part in the strikes , that no meetings of senior security officials took place to discuss such an operation , and that Khamenei did not authorize any attack .
“ No , no , no , no , no , and no , ” Miryousefi said to detailed questions from ███ on the alleged gatherings and Khamenei ’ s purported role .
The Saudi government communications office did not respond to a request for comment .

The kingdom is Iran ’ s principal regional rival and a petroleum giant whose production is crucial to the world economy . It is an important U.S. security partner . But its war on Yemen , which has killed thousands of civilians , and the brutal murder of Washington-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents last year , have strained its relations with U.S. lawmakers . There was no groundswell of support in Congress for military intervention to aid the Saudis after the attack .
The 17-minute strike on two Aramco installations by 18 drones and three low-flying missiles revealed the vulnerability of the Saudi oil company , despite billions spent by the kingdom on security .

The attack temporarily halved Saudi Arabia ’ s oil production and knocked out 5 % of the world ’ s oil supply . Global crude prices spiked .

The Islamic Republic has blamed “ thugs ” linked to the United States and other regional adversaries for orchestrating street demonstrations that have rocked Iran since mid-November , when the government hiked fuel prices .
Speaking at a televised , pro-government rally in Tehran on Monday , Salami , the Revolutionary Guards chief commander , warned Washington against any further escalation of tensions : “ We have shown patience towards the hostile moves of America , the Zionist regime ( Israel ) and Saudi Arabia against Iran ... but we will destroy them if they cross our red lines . ”
The plan by Iranian military leaders to strike Saudi oil installations developed over several months , according to the official close to Iran ’ s decision making .
“ Details were discussed thoroughly in at least five meetings and the final go ahead was given ” by early September , the official said .
All of those meetings took place at a secure location inside the southern Tehran compound , three of the officials told ███ . They said Khamenei , the supreme leader , attended one of the gatherings at his residence , which is also inside that complex .
Other attendees at some of those meetings included Khamenei ’ s top military advisor , Yahya Rahim-Safavi , and a deputy of Qasem Soleimani , who heads the Revolutionary Guards ’ foreign military and clandestine operations , the three officials said . Rahim-Safavi could not be reached for comment .
Among the possible targets initially discussed were a seaport in Saudi Arabia , an airport and U.S. military bases , the official close to Iran ’ s decision making said . The person would not provide additional details .
Those ideas were ultimately dismissed over concerns about mass casualties that could provoke fierce retaliation by the United States and embolden Israel , potentially pushing the region into war , the four people said .
The official close to Iran ’ s decision making said the group settled on the plan to attack Saudi Arabia ’ s oil installations because it could grab big headlines , inflict economic pain on an adversary and still deliver a strong message to Washington .
“ Agreement on Aramco was almost reached unanimously , ” the official said . “ The idea was to display Iran ’ s deep access and military capabilities . ”
The attack was the worst on Middle East oil facilities since Saddam Hussein , the late Iraqi strongman , torched Kuwait ’ s oil fields during the 1991 Gulf crisis .
U.S . Senator Martha McSally , an Air Force combat veteran and Republican lawmaker who was briefed by U.S. and Saudi officials , and who visited Aramco ’ s Abqaiq facility days after the attack , said the perpetrators knew precisely where to strike to create as much damage as possible .
“ It showed somebody who had a sophisticated understanding of facility operations like theirs , instead of just hitting things off of satellite photos , ” she told ███ . The drones and missiles , she added , “ came from Iranian soil , from an Iranian base . ”
A Middle East source , who was briefed by a country investigating the attack , said the launch site was the Ahvaz air base in southwest Iran . That account matched those of three U.S. officials and two other people who spoke to ███ : a Western intelligence official and a Western source based in the Middle East .
Rather than fly directly from Iran to Saudi Arabia over the Gulf , the missiles and drones took different , circuitous paths to the oil installations , part of Iran ’ s effort to mask its involvement , the people said .
Some of the craft flew over Iraq and Kuwait before landing in Saudi Arabia , according to the Western intelligence source , who said that trajectory provided Iran with plausible deniability .
“ That wouldn ’ t have been the case if missiles and drones had been seen or heard flying into Saudi Arabia over the Gulf from a south flight path ” from Iran , the person said .
Revolutionary Guards commanders briefed the supreme leader on the successful operation hours after the attack , according to the official close to the country ’ s decision making .
Images of fires raging at the Saudi facilities were broadcast worldwide . The country ’ s stock market swooned . Global oil prices initially surged 20 % . Officials at Saudi Aramco gathered in what was referred to internally as the “ emergency management room ” at the company ’ s headquarters .
One of the officials who spoke with ███ said Tehran was delighted with the outcome of the operation : Iran had landed a painful blow on Saudi Arabia and thumbed its nose at the United States .
The Revolutionary Guards and other branches of the Iranian military all ultimately report to Khamenei . The supreme leader has been defiant in response to Trump ’ s abandonment last year of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action , commonly called the Iran nuclear deal .
That 2015 accord with five permanent members of the U.S. Security Council – the United States , Russia , France , China and the United Kingdom – as well as Germany , removed billions of dollars ’ worth of sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran ’ s curbing its nuclear program .
Trump ’ s demand for a better deal has seen Iran launch a two-pronged strategy to win relief from sweeping sanctions reimposed by the United States , penalties that have crippled its oil exports and all but shut it out of the international banking system .
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has signaled a willingness to meet with American officials on condition that all sanctions be lifted . Simultaneously , Iran is flaunting its military and technical prowess .
In recent months , Iran has shot down a U.S. surveillance drone and seized a British oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz , the narrow channel through which about a fifth of the world ’ s oil moves . And it has announced it has amassed stockpiles of enriched uranium in violation of the U.N agreement , part of its vow to restart its nuclear program .
The Aramco attacks were an escalation that came as Trump had been pursuing his long-stated goal of extricating American forces from the Middle East . Just days after announcing an abrupt pullout of U.S. troops in northern Syria , the Trump administration on Oct. 11 said it would send fighter jets , missile-defense weaponry and 2,800 more troops to Saudi Arabia to bolster the kingdom ’ s defenses .
“ Do not strike another sovereign state , do not threaten American interests , American forces , or we will respond , ” U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper warned Tehran during a press briefing .
Still , Iran appears to have calculated that the Trump administration would not risk an all-out assault that could destabilize the region in the service of protecting Saudi oil , said Ali Vaez , director of the Iran Project at the International Crisis Group , a nonprofit working to end global conflict .
In Iran , “ hard-liners have come to believe that Trump is a Twitter tiger , ” Vaez said . “ As such there is little diplomatic or military cost associated with pushing back . ”
The senior Trump administration official disputed the suggestion that Iran ’ s operation has strengthened its hand in working out a deal for sanctions relief from the United States .
“ Iran knows exactly what it needs to do to see sanctions lifted , ” the official said .
The administration has said Iran must end support for terrorist groups in the Middle East and submit to tougher terms that would permanently snuff its nuclear ambitions . Iran has said it has no ties to terrorist groups .
Whether Tehran accedes to U.S. demands remains to be seen .
In one of the final meetings held ahead of the Saudi oil attack , another Revolutionary Guards commander was already looking ahead , according to the official close to Iran ’ s decision making who was briefed on that gathering .
“ Rest assured Allah almighty will be with us , ” the commander told senior security officials . “ Start planning for the next one . ”","(Reuters) - Four months before a swarm of drones and missiles crippled the world’s biggest oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia, Iranian security officials gathered at a heavily fortified compound in Tehran.

The group included the top echelons of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite branch of the Iranian military whose portfolio includes missile development and covert operations.

The main topic that day in May: How to punish the United States for pulling out of a landmark nuclear treaty and re-imposing economic sanctions on Iran, moves that have hit the Islamic Republic hard.

With Major General Hossein Salami, leader of the Revolutionary Guards, looking on, a senior commander took the floor.

“It is time to take out our swords and teach them a lesson,” the commander said, according to four people familiar with the meeting.

Hard-liners in the meeting talked of attacking high-value targets, including American military bases.

Yet, what ultimately emerged was a plan that stopped short of direct confrontation that could trigger a devastating U.S. response. Iran opted instead to target oil installations of America’s ally, Saudi Arabia, a proposal discussed by top Iranian military officials in that May meeting and at least four that followed.

Saudi Arabia was a strategic target.

The kingdom is Iran’s principal regional rival and a petroleum giant whose production is crucial to the world economy. It is an important U.S. security partner. But its war on Yemen, which has killed thousands of civilians, and the brutal murder of Washington-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents last year, have strained its relations with U.S. lawmakers.

The attack temporarily halved Saudi Arabia’s oil production and knocked out 5% of the world’s oil supply. Global crude prices spiked.

The assault prompted U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to accuse Iran of an “act of war.” In the aftermath, Tehran was hit with additional U.S. sanctions. The United States also launched cyber attacks against Iran, U.S. officials told Reuters.

The Islamic Republic has blamed “thugs” linked to the United States and other regional adversaries for orchestrating street demonstrations that have rocked Iran since mid-November, when the government hiked fuel prices.

SCOURING TARGETS

The plan by Iranian military leaders to strike Saudi oil installations developed over several months, according to the official close to Iran’s decision making.

“Details were discussed thoroughly in at least five meetings and the final go ahead was given” by early September, the official said.

All of those meetings took place at a secure location inside the southern Tehran compound, three of the officials told Reuters. They said Khamenei, the supreme leader, attended one of the gatherings at his residence, which is also inside that complex.

Other attendees at some of those meetings included Khamenei’s top military advisor, Yahya Rahim-Safavi, and a deputy of Qasem Soleimani, who heads the Revolutionary Guards’ foreign military and clandestine operations, the three officials said. Rahim-Safavi could not be reached for comment.

Among the possible targets initially discussed were a seaport in Saudi Arabia, an airport and U.S. military bases, the official close to Iran’s decision making said. The person would not provide additional details.

Those ideas were ultimately dismissed over concerns about mass casualties that could provoke fierce retaliation by the United States and embolden Israel, potentially pushing the region into war, the four people said.

The official close to Iran’s decision making said the group settled on the plan to attack Saudi Arabia’s oil installations because it could grab big headlines, inflict economic pain on an adversary and still deliver a strong message to Washington.

“Agreement on Aramco was almost reached unanimously,” the official said. “The idea was to display Iran’s deep access and military capabilities.”

The attack was the worst on Middle East oil facilities since Saddam Hussein, the late Iraqi strongman, torched Kuwait’s oil fields during the 1991 Gulf crisis.

U.S. Senator Martha McSally, an Air Force combat veteran and Republican lawmaker who was briefed by U.S. and Saudi officials, and who visited Aramco’s Abqaiq facility days after the attack, said the perpetrators knew precisely where to strike to create as much damage as possible.

“It showed somebody who had a sophisticated understanding of facility operations like theirs, instead of just hitting things off of satellite photos,” she told Reuters. The drones and missiles, she added, “came from Iranian soil, from an Iranian base.”

A Middle East source, who was briefed by a country investigating the attack, said the launch site was the Ahvaz air base in southwest Iran. That account matched those of three U.S. officials and two other people who spoke to Reuters: a Western intelligence official and a Western source based in the Middle East.

Rather than fly directly from Iran to Saudi Arabia over the Gulf, the missiles and drones took different, circuitous paths to the oil installations, part of Iran’s effort to mask its involvement, the people said.

Some of the craft flew over Iraq and Kuwait before landing in Saudi Arabia, according to the Western intelligence source, who said that trajectory provided Iran with plausible deniability.

“That wouldn’t have been the case if missiles and drones had been seen or heard flying into Saudi Arabia over the Gulf from a south flight path” from Iran, the person said.

Revolutionary Guards commanders briefed the supreme leader on the successful operation hours after the attack, according to the official close to the country’s decision making.

Images of fires raging at the Saudi facilities were broadcast worldwide. The country’s stock market swooned. Global oil prices initially surged 20%. Officials at Saudi Aramco gathered in what was referred to internally as the “emergency management room” at the company’s headquarters.

One of the officials who spoke with Reuters said Tehran was delighted with the outcome of the operation: Iran had landed a painful blow on Saudi Arabia and thumbed its nose at the United States.

SIZING UP TRUMP

The Revolutionary Guards and other branches of the Iranian military all ultimately report to Khamenei. The supreme leader has been defiant in response to Trump’s abandonment last year of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly called the Iran nuclear deal.

That 2015 accord with five permanent members of the U.S. Security Council – the United States, Russia, France, China and the United Kingdom – as well as Germany, removed billions of dollars’ worth of sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran’s curbing its nuclear program.

Trump’s demand for a better deal has seen Iran launch a two-pronged strategy to win relief from sweeping sanctions reimposed by the United States, penalties that have crippled its oil exports and all but shut it out of the international banking system.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has signaled a willingness to meet with American officials on condition that all sanctions be lifted. Simultaneously, Iran is flaunting its military and technical prowess.

In recent months, Iran has shot down a U.S. surveillance drone and seized a British oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow channel through which about a fifth of the world’s oil moves. And it has announced it has amassed stockpiles of enriched uranium in violation of the U.N agreement, part of its vow to restart its nuclear program.

The Aramco attacks were an escalation that came as Trump had been pursuing his long-stated goal of extricating American forces from the Middle East. Just days after announcing an abrupt pullout of U.S. troops in northern Syria, the Trump administration on Oct. 11 said it would send fighter jets, missile-defense weaponry and 2,800 more troops to Saudi Arabia to bolster the kingdom’s defenses.

“Do not strike another sovereign state, do not threaten American interests, American forces, or we will respond,” U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper warned Tehran during a press briefing.

Still, Iran appears to have calculated that the Trump administration would not risk an all-out assault that could destabilize the region in the service of protecting Saudi oil, said Ali Vaez, director of the Iran Project at the International Crisis Group, a nonprofit working to end global conflict.

In Iran, “hard-liners have come to believe that Trump is a Twitter tiger,” Vaez said. “As such there is little diplomatic or military cost associated with pushing back.”

The senior Trump administration official disputed the suggestion that Iran’s operation has strengthened its hand in working out a deal for sanctions relief from the United States.

“Iran knows exactly what it needs to do to see sanctions lifted,” the official said.

The administration has said Iran must end support for terrorist groups in the Middle East and submit to tougher terms that would permanently snuff its nuclear ambitions. Iran has said it has no ties to terrorist groups.

Whether Tehran accedes to U.S. demands remains to be seen.

In one of the final meetings held ahead of the Saudi oil attack, another Revolutionary Guards commander was already looking ahead, according to the official close to Iran’s decision making who was briefed on that gathering.

“Rest assured Allah almighty will be with us,” the commander told senior security officials. “Start planning for the next one.”",www.reuters.com,center,ZiVaTfaJeyKsRa30

But this would be sort of like being upset at the bear that trashed your campsite in search of your food. The bear was just being a bear, like Lindsey Graham and John McCain were just being themselves. Bears like peanut butter and Republican senators like to bedevil controversial Democratic appointees.

The real question is who forgot to seal up the cooler and hang the rest of the chow from a tree branch. Who enticed the bears into camp?

Rice, a friend and confidante of President Obama, gave the answer on Thursday night in an interview with NBC’s Brian Williams. It was Clinton herself that set in motion what would become the shambles of Rice’s once-inevitable march into the top cabinet slot for the second Obama term.

It was a round of Sunday show interviews in the wake of the Sept. 11 raid by Islamist militiamen in Libya that ultimately doomed Rice’s chance to have the top job. Rice, no doubt looking for the chance to burnish her profile on big issues, sallied forth the following Sunday to lay out the administration talking points that the deadly attack was a spontaneous result of riots over a YouTube video offensive to Muslims.

That wasn’t true, as some in the administration already knew. Not only was the attack not spontaneous, but there were no riots. It was a premeditated strike that resulted in a battle that raged off and on for many hours.

Questions have mounted about why security was inadequate despite rising warnings about radicals in the new Islamist state, why the president opted not to mount a rescue mission and the overall wisdom of helping install Islamist governments in the region.

Clinton , who became the clear frontrunner for the 2016 presidential election the day after this year’s election, sidestepped what she knew, or had reason to know, would be a disaster.

Did she disagree with the White House communications strategy of emphasizing the spontaneity of the raid? Not likely since she would herself publicly emphasize the non-existent riots and the video in public remarks.

Her agency had denied requests for additional security despite prior attacks and warnings from the doomed ambassador. She herself likely knew what the president knew, and when he knew it, about the raid and why Obama chose not to send reinforcements to the consulate.

Rice’s rueful explanation about Clinton sidestepping the Sunday shows makes it clear she knows who lured the bears into camp. Rice, a stalwart retainer of the House of Obama, knows that Clinton, the matriarch of the rival Democratic clan, let the ambitious ambassador take the fall. Not only did it shield Clinton but it also helped set up the nomination of her former colleague and ally, Sen. John Kerry.

Having survived the first several rounds of the Benghazi debacle, Clinton faces her final and greatest test: testimony before fuming House Republicans.

Clinton has been summoned to testify on Thursday about the raid, but her spokeswoman says it’s not certain that she will appear. Clinton is no stranger to hostile questioning in testimony and depositions tracing all the way back to her time as first lady of Arkansas, so she is well equipped on how to evade unpleasant questions. “I do not recall,” being a useful phrase.

It’s a tricky task, but as Rice learned and Obama has been taught again, Clinton is not someone to be underestimated.

And Now, A Word From Charles

“The idea that the readout that this was a ‘frank discussion’ [between Speaker John Boehner and President Obama]: Look, frank is a word they use in diplomacy. When it was used in the cold war -- when Kennedy would meet Khrushchev -- they would announce that the meetings were frank and people would restock the bomb shelters.”

AMY GOODMAN : This is ███ ! , democracynow.org , The War and Peace Report . I ’ m Amy Goodman , as we continue our roundtable discussion on Syria , the United States striking a Syrian military airbase for the first time in the six-year Syrian civil war . Speaking Thursday , interestingly , at the Women in the World Summit in New York City , before the strike happened , before President Trump came out in Florida , former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the U.S. should take out Syrian President Bashar al-Assad ’ s airfields , after the chemical attack that killed scores of people on Tuesday .
HILLARY CLINTON : I think we should have been more willing to confront Assad . … I really believe that we should have and still should take out his airfields and prevent him from being able to use them to bomb innocent people and drop sarin gas on them .
AMY GOODMAN : For more , we are going to Lebanon , where we ’ re joined by Yazan al-Saadi , Syrian-Canadian writer , researcher based in Beirut . We are also continuing with Alia Malek , author of The Home That Was Our Country : A Memoir of Syria . Phyllis Bennis is with us , a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies . And we ’ re joined by Medea Benjamin , who is co-founder of CodePink .
So , let ’ s go to Lebanon right now , to Yazan al-Saadi . Your response to the first U.S. attack on the Syrian military base , after the Tuesday chemical attack in Syria ?
YAZAN AL-SAADI : Well , my first response is that I personally don ’ t think it ’ s going to matter much in the long term . I think it ’ s simply a symbolic attack . Let us not forget that the U.S. has told the Russians beforehand that they were going to do it . They hit a lone air base . This won ’ t really damage the capabilities of the Assad regime to do what it is doing .
I also would like to highlight that regardless of the fact that it ’ s the first so-called U.S. response on the Syrian regime , the U.S. has been bombing Syria since 2014 , killing hundreds of civilians . So , for me , I would have to disagree with my other guest , Alia , in saying that this is a positive thing . There can be nothing positive , nothing at all , from the U.S. regime , nor the Russian regime , in their bombings and invasions of Syria . Neither of them—
YAZAN AL-SAADI : Yeah , Lina and Alia mentioned that this is somehow positive . I mean , let ’ s be honest . Both these superpowers , with other reactionary forces in the region , do not give a damn about Syrian self-determination nor justice for Syrians , like they don ’ t give a damn about other communities in the region , from Bahrain to Yemen to Palestine . So , I have no hope , with the Putin regime or the Trump regime , in whatever they do . They can say whatever they want , but their actions have proven that they really don ’ t care . And they were just—it ’ s basically barks between each other . And it ’ s not really going to matter much for the people on the ground who are dying .
ALIA MALEK : Yeah . No , I didn ’ t say it was a positive thing . I said it might mean that there ’ s one less airfield from which these kinds of attacks can be launched . And I didn ’ t come to this discussion about Syria today . And that ’ s part of the problem , is a lot of people are sort of weighing into it today . For since the very beginning , actually , and before 2011 , we have been calling for accountability for the Assad regime in what it had sort of—its persecution and prosecution of dissent and opposition for years . This goes back to before 2011 . And similarly , I ’ ve never said that the only way to engage Syria or to hold Bashar al-Assad or other players accountable is with military—military intervention . I ’ ve never been pro-military intervention . The reality is , this regime has backers : Iran and Russia . The United States , at any point during the Obama administration , could have—could have confronted them not on—not in a military sense in Syria , using Syria as a proxy , but in the kinds of negotiations that happen bilaterally all the time . Let ’ s not forget , the U.S. was negotiating a deal with Iran . It had a card to play . It had leverage that it could have used on the Syrian regime ’ s principal backer .
And I just want to speak to the idea of what Tulsi Gabbard said and about accountability . I don ’ t disagree . Yes , there should be accountability . There ’ s going to be no way to piece Syria back together if there isn ’ t accountability for those who have perpetrated crimes , no matter what side they ’ re on , or justice for the victims , no matter what side they ’ re on . But a lot of people are kind of placing Syria as a character , as a bit character , into their larger sort of geopolitical narratives of what is happening in this world . Whether you ’ re objecting to intervention by outside powers , you know , Syria just becomes like the latest theater to have that discussion . Whether it ’ s a discussion about sectarianism and whether Sunnis are being killed by Shia , it just becomes—or Shia-related minorities , it becomes a way to look at Syria in that sense . But I ’ m—I ’ ve always advocated for looking at Syria for the sake of Syrians and creating a country that is stable and safe and free for all its people . So I just—you know , Yazan—I appreciate Yazan ’ s comments . He ’ s correct . There ’ s nobody who really cares about Syria , I think , other than its own people . But he shouldn ’ t mischaracterize my position .
And one more thing I would just like to say . I have been struck in the last six years over the debate on Syria why there ’ s sort of a fixed amount of critical thinking or a fixed amount of anger or a fixed amount of sympathy and empathy . You know , once you take sort of one position , it ’ s as if you can not sympathize or empathize or be critical of another position . Just because one is critical of Russian intervention does not mean that one can not be critical of American intervention . And I think , in a principled , coherent way of looking at these things , we won ’ t fall into those traps , which a lot of people are falling into .
YAZAN AL-SAADI : I agree with her last point . I mean , there was , and there continues to be , a big problem in the discussions of Syria , where geopolitics and ideological lines are defining over and beyond the rights and dignities of people . So this has been going on , and it ’ s still going on 'til this day . The conversations about U.S. bombing of an airfield in Syria has generated a sense of hysteria . Some people , that so-called anti-imperialist front , are saying this is the beginning of World War III , which is a ridiculous statement . And other people say this is the first time America has intervened in Syria . And this is not true . The Americans have been intervening in Syria for a long time , in various ways—not really against the regime , and I agree with Alia there . They really—it is not in their interest to promote and develop self-determination of Syrians . And it 's a clear policy they have for the entire region .
Let ’ s look at the bigger picture here . And when I say “ the bigger picture , ” I ’ m talking about not the simple anti-imperialist or geopolitics discourse . I ’ m talking about : What about self-determination for all the communities ? Because what ’ s happening in Syria is part of a process . This latest chapter , that started in 2011 , is part of a regional chapter that we saw erupting from Bahrain to Yemen and elsewhere . So , really , any hope or any feeling by anyone that Russia or the U.S. or regional states , like Turkey , Iran , Saudi Arabia , or the regime itself care or want to promote Syrian or anyone else ’ s self-determination and freedoms and security , it ’ s ridiculous . It ’ s a ridiculous assumption , you know ?
AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to bring in Medea Benjamin , who has written extensively about war . She ’ s author of Kingdom of the Unjust : Behind the U.S.-Saudi Connection—and there ’ s certainly a Saudi connection here—also written about drones . Your thoughts last night when you heard that the U.S. had just struck a Syrian military base ? As Yazan said , the U.S. has been part of coalition bombing in Syria for a long time , killed hundreds of people , but this is the first time attacking a Syrian military base .
MEDEA BENJAMIN : Well , first , let ’ s look at the history of the U.S. in the region and the legacy of the U.S. intervention , whether it ’ s Afghanistan , Iraq or Libya . It ’ s all been terrible for the local people . I think we , on this conversation , all care about the Syrian people . Let ’ s look at what we can do . And I think that means going to Congress , going out in the streets and saying we don ’ t want U.S. further intervention , but we do want something that will be positive for the Syrian people . That means immediately lifting of the Trump ban on Syrian refugees coming to the United States , of funding of the $ 5 billion that the U.N. says is desperately needed to help the humanitarian crisis facing the Syrian refugees , and demand that the U.S. work with Russia to finally come to a ceasefire and work for a political solution , and that the United Nations get involved in this . I think this is an opening that we have to seize to say enough is enough , enough people have died , more war is not the answer , let ’ s find a political solution .
AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to turn to what people are seeing on TV , what started to take over the networks last night , when the Pentagon released video footage of the U.S. missiles firing . This is MSNBC anchor Brian Williams referring to that Pentagon video , fired at Syria , as “ beautiful , ” something like three times in 30 seconds .
BRIAN WILLIAMS : Go into greater detail . We see these beautiful pictures at night from the decks of these two U.S. Navy vessels in the eastern Mediterranean . I am tempted to quote the great Leonard Cohen : “ I ’ m guided by the beauty of our weapons. ” And they are beautiful pictures of fearsome armaments making what is for them a brief flight over to this airfield . What did they hit ?
AMY GOODMAN : That is MSNBC ’ s Brian Williams speaking last night , describing that footage , the Tomahawk cruise missiles flying into the air from the naval warships , reminding one of , back in 2003 , shock and awe in Iraq , certainly a very different scale . But , Medea , your response ?
MEDEA BENJAMIN : It ’ s absolutely disgusting , this glorification of weapons that are of much of mass destruction as the use of chemical weapons . The U.S. has been incinerating people for years with drone strikes , killed over 200 people in Mosul just recently . The U.S. is arming the Saudis , that have led to the catastrophic situation in Yemen where one child is dying every single 10 minutes . We should not glorify the weapons , and we should not have a selective sympathy for people who are dying , whether they ’ re dying from our weapons or other nations ’ weapons .
AMY GOODMAN : These are some of the tweets from President Trump on Syria . Now , this is back in 2013 . And the reason this period is significant , it was after the first chemical weapons attack , when some 1,400 Syrians died . He tweeted , “ What I am saying is stay out of Syria. ” Another tweet : “ If Obama attacks Syria and innocent civilians are hurt and killed , he and the U.S. will look very bad ! ” “ Again , to our very foolish leader , do not attack Syria—if you do many very bad things will happen and from that fight the U.S. gets nothing ! ” And he tweeted , “ President Obama , do not attack Syria . There is no upside and tremendous downside . Save your 'powder ' for another ( and more important ) day ! ” I was wondering if Yazan would respond to what President Trump said four years ago , after that first chemical attack ?
YAZAN AL-SAADI : I mean , what is there to respond to a very revolting human being who is misogynistic , xenophobic and a constant liar ? I mean , there isn ’ t much to respond to this man . I think he is clearly—
YAZAN AL-SAADI : He ’ s playing a game . He ’ s playing a game . You know , when he ’ s—
AMY GOODMAN : Last night , talking about the cruel suffocating of the children ?
YAZAN AL-SAADI : I ’ m sorry , but when he ’ s talking about the cruel suffocation of babies—right ? —this is a man that doesn ’ t mind these babies drowning on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea with their family trying to escape the horrors of Syria . This man doesn ’ t mind bombing places in Iraq , where hundreds of people have died . This man doesn ’ t mind supporting Saudi Arabia , the world ’ s most embarrassing country , in its slaughter of Yemen . This man doesn ’ t mind making a deal with Bashar al-Assad , a revolting tyrant , in order to fight ISIS . So , I can ’ t really take him seriously , nor can I take seriously , as well , another individual who is as revolting : Putin . Both of them are fascist individuals . Both of them don ’ t give a damn about the people of this region or the communities of the world . So , for me to respond to this man , why would I respond to a xenophobic , disgusting individual ?
AMY GOODMAN : Phyllis Bennis of the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington , what has changed for Donald Trump ? I mean , even a few days ago , on Friday , you had Rex Tillerson , the secretary of state , and Nikki Haley , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , saying that they are shifting gear and that their priority is not to get Assad out .
PHYLLIS BENNIS : That wasn ’ t a shift in gear . The shift in gear was now , suddenly , because of Trump ’ s emotional reaction to the deaths of these particular children—what Yazan said is so crucially important—the hypocrisy , the selective outrage , that this group of children somehow sparks the outrage that didn ’ t exist when children were slaughtered under U.S. bombs in Mosul , when children were killed trying to make the crossing with their parents to a United States that would not accept them , that was slamming a door in their face , and drowning on the beach as a result . You know , this is not about a strategy . This is about a lashing out . It may be tied to concerns about all the political ways that the Trump administration is losing support . That ’ s certainly part of it .
But I think we also have to recognize that , historically , the role of the United States in the region has included a long-standing relationship with the regime of Bashar al-Assad and his father , whether it was recruiting the father in to bring his air force to help the United States bomb Iraq in 1991 , where Syrian planes were part of that coalition ; in 2002 , when Bashar al-Assad agreed that the United States would be able to outsource torture and interrogation to Syria , because they were experts at that , and sent U.S.-held detainees to be tortured by the Syrian regime in Syria . So , you know , this history of relationship , collaboration , coalition with the Syrian regime , and then , at particular moments , for their own purposes—and it ’ s true , it has nothing to do with concerns about the people of Syria . There are now at least 11 separate wars being waged in Syria , and only one of them has something to do with the people of Syria . Whether we ’ re talking about the war between Turkey and the Kurds , the war between Saudi Arabia and Iran , the war between the U.S. and Russia , which is in transition right now , all of these wars are being waged in Syria . And the effect in Syria is that it ’ s Syrians doing the dying . It ’ s not Syrians who stand to gain from any of these wars . The only thing we need to do with these wars is not to win them , but to end it , to end the fighting in Syria .
This escalation by the United States of its existing level of bombing and special forces engagement and intervention in Syria has now been escalated to direct bombing against the regime ’ s targets . This is going to make things worse , and not better . The call , I think , needs to be to stop the bombing , stop the claim that somehow there is a military solution here , acknowledge there is no military solution and figure out how to make the kind of massive investment of high-profile time , of money , of attention , of all the things into diplomacy , negotiations , a new approach that ’ s not going to be based on the clearly false assumption that somehow this is a war that can be won . It can not be won . It has to be ended instead .
AMY GOODMAN : Let me end on refugees , Alia . The president , Trump , not only as president , but on the campaign , repeatedly said he will keep Syrian refugees out of this country , every last one . What now ? What is happening now ? We just heard about a Syrian activist , scholar , with a French passport , just denied coming into the country in Washington , even though the courts have said you can ’ t institute this Muslim ban . It ’ s not as if there ’ s not a crackdown now all over the world around Muslims coming in , and particularly Syrians .
ALIA MALEK : I don ’ t like to predict the future , but I don ’ t see a massive change . I think American attention spans are short . I don ’ t think this was a real escalation . I don ’ t—it doesn ’ t appear to me that Trump—like everyone has said , Trump clearly doesn ’ t care about the Syrian people . I ’ m not really sure he ’ s willing to confront Russia in Syria in a massive escalation . I think this is sort of—I mean , and I think even to call it an emotional response is quite generous . You know , the Russians were—had cleared their people from the base . The Syrians had cleared their people from the base . It was very—
ALIA MALEK : Yeah , so there was—it was a highly orchestrated piece of theater . That ’ s what it looks like from now , for me . So , I think that tomorrow or the day after tomorrow , something else he ’ s going to be tweeting about , or something else is going to happen . Attention spans are going to move . And of course he ’ s not going to change his policy toward Syrians . I don ’ t believe—you know , look at what he has done as opposed to what he said last night . Do I believe that he is really committed to Syrians living in dignity and peace ? I don ’ t think so . And it doesn ’ t serve his—I mean , rhetorically , it doesn ’ t serve him .
AMY GOODMAN : And , Medea Benjamin , Rex Tillerson will be meeting with the foreign minister , Lavrov , of Russia on Tuesday . Lavrov made a statement condemning the attack , but also left the door open for a conversation . Where do you think this goes ?
MEDEA BENJAMIN : Well , where we want it to go is to talk to the Russians not about how to divvy up airspace to continue killing Syrians , but how to end this . And let ’ s put it in the context of President Trump upping the ante by calling for $ 54 billion more in the U.S. budget for the military . The only ones benefiting from this is Raytheon , Northrop Grumman , the military-industrial complex . Trump wants to widen wars in Syria . He also wants to widen wars in Iraq , in Yemen . And I think we have to stop him before he takes us down a path of greater and greater militarization throughout the Middle East .
AMY GOODMAN : I want to thank you all for being with us . In Lebanon , thank you to Yazan al-Saadi , Syrian-Canadian writer in Beirut ; Alia Malek , here in New York , author of The Home That Was Our Country : A Memoir of Syria ; Phyllis Bennis , fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies ; and Medea Benjamin , co-founder of CodePink . Thanks so much for being with us . And thanks to Lina Sergie Attar , who joined us earlier from Boston , a writer from Aleppo , co-founder of the Karam Foundation .

AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I’m Amy Goodman, as we continue our roundtable discussion on Syria, the United States striking a Syrian military airbase for the first time in the six-year Syrian civil war. Speaking Thursday, interestingly, at the Women in the World Summit in New York City, before the strike happened, before President Trump came out in Florida, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the U.S. should take out Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s airfields, after the chemical attack that killed scores of people on Tuesday.

HILLARY CLINTON: I think we should have been more willing to confront Assad. … I really believe that we should have and still should take out his airfields and prevent him from being able to use them to bomb innocent people and drop sarin gas on them.

AMY GOODMAN: For more, we are going to Lebanon, where we’re joined by Yazan al-Saadi, Syrian-Canadian writer, researcher based in Beirut. We are also continuing with Alia Malek, author of The Home That Was Our Country: A Memoir of Syria. Phyllis Bennis is with us, a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies. And we’re joined by Medea Benjamin, who is co-founder of CodePink.

So, let’s go to Lebanon right now, to Yazan al-Saadi. Your response to the first U.S. attack on the Syrian military base, after the Tuesday chemical attack in Syria?

YAZAN AL-SAADI: Well, my first response is that I personally don’t think it’s going to matter much in the long term. I think it’s simply a symbolic attack. Let us not forget that the U.S. has told the Russians beforehand that they were going to do it. They hit a lone air base. This won’t really damage the capabilities of the Assad regime to do what it is doing.

I also would like to highlight that regardless of the fact that it’s the first so-called U.S. response on the Syrian regime, the U.S. has been bombing Syria since 2014, killing hundreds of civilians. So, for me, I would have to disagree with my other guest, Alia, in saying that this is a positive thing. There can be nothing positive, nothing at all, from the U.S. regime, nor the Russian regime, in their bombings and invasions of Syria. Neither of them—

AMY GOODMAN: You’re referring to Lina.

YAZAN AL-SAADI: Yeah, Lina and Alia mentioned that this is somehow positive. I mean, let’s be honest. Both these superpowers, with other reactionary forces in the region, do not give a damn about Syrian self-determination nor justice for Syrians, like they don’t give a damn about other communities in the region, from Bahrain to Yemen to Palestine. So, I have no hope, with the Putin regime or the Trump regime, in whatever they do. They can say whatever they want, but their actions have proven that they really don’t care. And they were just—it’s basically barks between each other. And it’s not really going to matter much for the people on the ground who are dying.

AMY GOODMAN: Alia, if you would respond?

ALIA MALEK: Yeah. No, I didn’t say it was a positive thing. I said it might mean that there’s one less airfield from which these kinds of attacks can be launched. And I didn’t come to this discussion about Syria today. And that’s part of the problem, is a lot of people are sort of weighing into it today. For since the very beginning, actually, and before 2011, we have been calling for accountability for the Assad regime in what it had sort of—its persecution and prosecution of dissent and opposition for years. This goes back to before 2011. And similarly, I’ve never said that the only way to engage Syria or to hold Bashar al-Assad or other players accountable is with military—military intervention. I’ve never been pro-military intervention. The reality is, this regime has backers: Iran and Russia. The United States, at any point during the Obama administration, could have—could have confronted them not on—not in a military sense in Syria, using Syria as a proxy, but in the kinds of negotiations that happen bilaterally all the time. Let’s not forget, the U.S. was negotiating a deal with Iran. It had a card to play. It had leverage that it could have used on the Syrian regime’s principal backer.

And I just want to speak to the idea of what Tulsi Gabbard said and about accountability. I don’t disagree. Yes, there should be accountability. There’s going to be no way to piece Syria back together if there isn’t accountability for those who have perpetrated crimes, no matter what side they’re on, or justice for the victims, no matter what side they’re on. But a lot of people are kind of placing Syria as a character, as a bit character, into their larger sort of geopolitical narratives of what is happening in this world. Whether you’re objecting to intervention by outside powers, you know, Syria just becomes like the latest theater to have that discussion. Whether it’s a discussion about sectarianism and whether Sunnis are being killed by Shia, it just becomes—or Shia-related minorities, it becomes a way to look at Syria in that sense. But I’m—I’ve always advocated for looking at Syria for the sake of Syrians and creating a country that is stable and safe and free for all its people. So I just—you know, Yazan—I appreciate Yazan’s comments. He’s correct. There’s nobody who really cares about Syria, I think, other than its own people. But he shouldn’t mischaracterize my position.

And one more thing I would just like to say. I have been struck in the last six years over the debate on Syria why there’s sort of a fixed amount of critical thinking or a fixed amount of anger or a fixed amount of sympathy and empathy. You know, once you take sort of one position, it’s as if you cannot sympathize or empathize or be critical of another position. Just because one is critical of Russian intervention does not mean that one cannot be critical of American intervention. And I think, in a principled, coherent way of looking at these things, we won’t fall into those traps, which a lot of people are falling into.

AMY GOODMAN: Yazan al-Saadi in Beirut?

YAZAN AL-SAADI: I agree with her last point. I mean, there was, and there continues to be, a big problem in the discussions of Syria, where geopolitics and ideological lines are defining over and beyond the rights and dignities of people. So this has been going on, and it’s still going on 'til this day. The conversations about U.S. bombing of an airfield in Syria has generated a sense of hysteria. Some people, that so-called anti-imperialist front, are saying this is the beginning of World War III, which is a ridiculous statement. And other people say this is the first time America has intervened in Syria. And this is not true. The Americans have been intervening in Syria for a long time, in various ways—not really against the regime, and I agree with Alia there. They really—it is not in their interest to promote and develop self-determination of Syrians. And it's a clear policy they have for the entire region.

Let’s look at the bigger picture here. And when I say “the bigger picture,” I’m talking about not the simple anti-imperialist or geopolitics discourse. I’m talking about: What about self-determination for all the communities? Because what’s happening in Syria is part of a process. This latest chapter, that started in 2011, is part of a regional chapter that we saw erupting from Bahrain to Yemen and elsewhere. So, really, any hope or any feeling by anyone that Russia or the U.S. or regional states, like Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia, or the regime itself care or want to promote Syrian or anyone else’s self-determination and freedoms and security, it’s ridiculous. It’s a ridiculous assumption, you know?

AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to bring in Medea Benjamin, who has written extensively about war. She’s author of Kingdom of the Unjust: Behind the U.S.-Saudi Connection—and there’s certainly a Saudi connection here—also written about drones. Your thoughts last night when you heard that the U.S. had just struck a Syrian military base? As Yazan said, the U.S. has been part of coalition bombing in Syria for a long time, killed hundreds of people, but this is the first time attacking a Syrian military base.

MEDEA BENJAMIN: Well, first, let’s look at the history of the U.S. in the region and the legacy of the U.S. intervention, whether it’s Afghanistan, Iraq or Libya. It’s all been terrible for the local people. I think we, on this conversation, all care about the Syrian people. Let’s look at what we can do. And I think that means going to Congress, going out in the streets and saying we don’t want U.S. further intervention, but we do want something that will be positive for the Syrian people. That means immediately lifting of the Trump ban on Syrian refugees coming to the United States, of funding of the $5 billion that the U.N. says is desperately needed to help the humanitarian crisis facing the Syrian refugees, and demand that the U.S. work with Russia to finally come to a ceasefire and work for a political solution, and that the United Nations get involved in this. I think this is an opening that we have to seize to say enough is enough, enough people have died, more war is not the answer, let’s find a political solution.

AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to turn to what people are seeing on TV, what started to take over the networks last night, when the Pentagon released video footage of the U.S. missiles firing. This is MSNBC anchor Brian Williams referring to that Pentagon video, fired at Syria, as “beautiful,” something like three times in 30 seconds.

BRIAN WILLIAMS: Go into greater detail. We see these beautiful pictures at night from the decks of these two U.S. Navy vessels in the eastern Mediterranean. I am tempted to quote the great Leonard Cohen: “I’m guided by the beauty of our weapons.” And they are beautiful pictures of fearsome armaments making what is for them a brief flight over to this airfield. What did they hit?

AMY GOODMAN: That is MSNBC’s Brian Williams speaking last night, describing that footage, the Tomahawk cruise missiles flying into the air from the naval warships, reminding one of, back in 2003, shock and awe in Iraq, certainly a very different scale. But, Medea, your response?

MEDEA BENJAMIN: It’s absolutely disgusting, this glorification of weapons that are of much of mass destruction as the use of chemical weapons. The U.S. has been incinerating people for years with drone strikes, killed over 200 people in Mosul just recently. The U.S. is arming the Saudis, that have led to the catastrophic situation in Yemen where one child is dying every single 10 minutes. We should not glorify the weapons, and we should not have a selective sympathy for people who are dying, whether they’re dying from our weapons or other nations’ weapons.

AMY GOODMAN: These are some of the tweets from President Trump on Syria. Now, this is back in 2013. And the reason this period is significant, it was after the first chemical weapons attack, when some 1,400 Syrians died. He tweeted, “What I am saying is stay out of Syria.” Another tweet: “If Obama attacks Syria and innocent civilians are hurt and killed, he and the U.S. will look very bad!” “Again, to our very foolish leader, do not attack Syria—if you do many very bad things will happen and from that fight the U.S. gets nothing!” And he tweeted, “President Obama, do not attack Syria. There is no upside and tremendous downside. Save your 'powder' for another (and more important) day!” I was wondering if Yazan would respond to what President Trump said four years ago, after that first chemical attack?

YAZAN AL-SAADI: I mean, what is there to respond to a very revolting human being who is misogynistic, xenophobic and a constant liar? I mean, there isn’t much to respond to this man. I think he is clearly—

AMY GOODMAN: But today—

YAZAN AL-SAADI: He’s playing a game.

AMY GOODMAN: But last night—

YAZAN AL-SAADI: He’s playing a game. He’s playing a game. You know, when he’s—

AMY GOODMAN: Last night, talking about the cruel suffocating of the children?

YAZAN AL-SAADI: I’m sorry, but when he’s talking about the cruel suffocation of babies—right?—this is a man that doesn’t mind these babies drowning on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea with their family trying to escape the horrors of Syria. This man doesn’t mind bombing places in Iraq, where hundreds of people have died. This man doesn’t mind supporting Saudi Arabia, the world’s most embarrassing country, in its slaughter of Yemen. This man doesn’t mind making a deal with Bashar al-Assad, a revolting tyrant, in order to fight ISIS. So, I can’t really take him seriously, nor can I take seriously, as well, another individual who is as revolting: Putin. Both of them are fascist individuals. Both of them don’t give a damn about the people of this region or the communities of the world. So, for me to respond to this man, why would I respond to a xenophobic, disgusting individual?

AMY GOODMAN: Phyllis Bennis of the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, what has changed for Donald Trump? I mean, even a few days ago, on Friday, you had Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, and Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, saying that they are shifting gear and that their priority is not to get Assad out.

PHYLLIS BENNIS: That wasn’t a shift in gear. The shift in gear was now, suddenly, because of Trump’s emotional reaction to the deaths of these particular children—what Yazan said is so crucially important—the hypocrisy, the selective outrage, that this group of children somehow sparks the outrage that didn’t exist when children were slaughtered under U.S. bombs in Mosul, when children were killed trying to make the crossing with their parents to a United States that would not accept them, that was slamming a door in their face, and drowning on the beach as a result. You know, this is not about a strategy. This is about a lashing out. It may be tied to concerns about all the political ways that the Trump administration is losing support. That’s certainly part of it.

But I think we also have to recognize that, historically, the role of the United States in the region has included a long-standing relationship with the regime of Bashar al-Assad and his father, whether it was recruiting the father in to bring his air force to help the United States bomb Iraq in 1991, where Syrian planes were part of that coalition; in 2002, when Bashar al-Assad agreed that the United States would be able to outsource torture and interrogation to Syria, because they were experts at that, and sent U.S.-held detainees to be tortured by the Syrian regime in Syria. So, you know, this history of relationship, collaboration, coalition with the Syrian regime, and then, at particular moments, for their own purposes—and it’s true, it has nothing to do with concerns about the people of Syria.

And the effect in Syria is that it’s Syrians doing the dying. It’s not Syrians who stand to gain from any of these wars. The only thing we need to do with these wars is not to win them, but to end it, to end the fighting in Syria.

This escalation by the United States of its existing level of bombing and special forces engagement and intervention in Syria has now been escalated to direct bombing against the regime’s targets. This is going to make things worse, and not better. The call, I think, needs to be to stop the bombing, stop the claim that somehow there is a military solution here, acknowledge there is no military solution and figure out how to make the kind of massive investment of high-profile time, of money, of attention, of all the things into diplomacy, negotiations, a new approach that’s not going to be based on the clearly false assumption that somehow this is a war that can be won. It cannot be won. It has to be ended instead.

AMY GOODMAN: Let me end on refugees, Alia. The president, Trump, not only as president, but on the campaign, repeatedly said he will keep Syrian refugees out of this country, every last one. What now? What is happening now? We just heard about a Syrian activist, scholar, with a French passport, just denied coming into the country in Washington, even though the courts have said you can’t institute this Muslim ban. It’s not as if there’s not a crackdown now all over the world around Muslims coming in, and particularly Syrians.

ALIA MALEK: I don’t like to predict the future, but I don’t see a massive change. I think American attention spans are short. I don’t think this was a real escalation. I don’t—it doesn’t appear to me that Trump—like everyone has said, Trump clearly doesn’t care about the Syrian people. I’m not really sure he’s willing to confront Russia in Syria in a massive escalation. I think this is sort of—I mean, and I think even to call it an emotional response is quite generous. You know, the Russians were—had cleared their people from the base. The Syrians had cleared their people from the base. It was very—

AMY GOODMAN: The U.S. warned Russia.

ALIA MALEK: Yeah, so there was—it was a highly orchestrated piece of theater. That’s what it looks like from now, for me. So, I think that tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, something else he’s going to be tweeting about, or something else is going to happen. Attention spans are going to move. And of course he’s not going to change his policy toward Syrians. I don’t believe—you know, look at what he has done as opposed to what he said last night. Do I believe that he is really committed to Syrians living in dignity and peace? I don’t think so. And it doesn’t serve his—I mean, rhetorically, it doesn’t serve him.

AMY GOODMAN: And, Medea Benjamin, Rex Tillerson will be meeting with the foreign minister, Lavrov, of Russia on Tuesday. Lavrov made a statement condemning the attack, but also left the door open for a conversation. Where do you think this goes?

MEDEA BENJAMIN: Well, where we want it to go is to talk to the Russians not about how to divvy up airspace to continue killing Syrians, but how to end this. And let’s put it in the context of President Trump upping the ante by calling for $54 billion more in the U.S. budget for the military. The only ones benefiting from this is Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, the military-industrial complex. Trump wants to widen wars in Syria. He also wants to widen wars in Iraq, in Yemen. And I think we have to stop him before he takes us down a path of greater and greater militarization throughout the Middle East.

AMY GOODMAN: I want to thank you all for being with us. In Lebanon, thank you to Yazan al-Saadi, Syrian-Canadian writer in Beirut; Alia Malek, here in New York, author of The Home That Was Our Country: A Memoir of Syria; Phyllis Bennis, fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies; and Medea Benjamin, co-founder of CodePink. Thanks so much for being with us. And thanks to Lina Sergie Attar, who joined us earlier from Boston, a writer from Aleppo, co-founder of the Karam Foundation.

Trump immediately asserted himself during his first interaction with Macron on Saturday morning, in which he urged NATO countries to contribute more to defense spending, a point he’s fixated on throughout his presidency.

“We want it to be fair,” Trump said just before a one-on-one meeting at the Élysée Palace. “We want to help Europe but it has to be fair. Right now the burden-sharing has been largely on the United States.”

His comments came after Macron worked hard to subtly declare a truce between the two leaders. Trump had taken offense — and expressed so over Twitter late Friday night — over Macron’s suggestion that the European Union needed its own army.

Still, the relationship between the two leaders did not seem as warm Saturday as it did in past meetings when the two leaders mugged for the cameras, vigorously shook hands and patted each other on the back. Trump’s only other trip to Paris as president occurred in July 2017, when he attended a huge military parade that delighted him so much that he sought his own at home.

Several points are worth remembering about how the Syrian civil war began . First , to the extent that a moderate opposition existed , it was weak . There were Syrians who protested peacefully , and many hoped for a secular alternative to Assad . These people were no match for a well-trained Syrian army supported by Russia , Iran , and Hezbollah . The U.S. could have poured weaponry into the conflict , but most intended recipients would have had little training or combat experience . Those weapons would have changed hands , just as U.S.-provided artillery , tanks and Humvees have in Iraq .
Second , the opposition was disorganized and lacked coherent leadership . Many people recognize the names Assad and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi , the leader of ISIL . Some recognize the name Abu Mohammad al-Julani , head of the Nusra Front . But who can name anyone in the moderate Syrian opposition ? Who leads the Free Syrian Army or the Syrian National Coalition ?
Third , Assad and the powers supporting him had a clear objective : keep Assad in power . Syria ’ s allies were unburdened by the regime ’ s atrocities , because they had a dog in the fight . In contrast , the U.S. found itself in a catch-22 . By attacking Assad it would help extremist rebels ; by attacking extremist rebels it would help Assad . Unwilling to back either party , and without a plausible alternative , the U.S. had no clear goal . And thus no clear strategy . The administration believed it could keep its hands clean by not intervening militarily . Meanwhile , the body count continued to rise .
In this context , Washington chose a third way . When President Obama called on Assad to step down in August of 2011 , he invested the U.S. in the dictator ’ s defeat without changing policy on the ground to facilitate that outcome . The possibility of Assad winning the war outright was no longer on the table , and U.S. acquiescence to a political solution in which Assad remained became more difficult . To do something , the U.S. imposed additional sanctions on the Syrian government , froze Syrian assets under U.S. control , prohibited commercial ties with Damascus , and blocked the import of Syrian oil .
There were other actions too . The U.S. helped to establish supply routes and funneled money , intelligence , and non-lethal aid to handpicked rebels , many of whom would later change sides . Physical supplies included communications equipment , night vision goggles , bullet proof vests , pickup trucks , food , medicine , and more . Most damaging , the U.S. and its partners did little to prevent states like Qatar and Saudi Arabia from sending vast sums of materiel and money to Assad ’ s opposition , including its most extreme elements . Turkey faced little pressure to control its border , even as thousands of militants flooded into Syria to join the war .
It was clear that none of this would be decisive , but it was also clear that these steps would prevent Assad ’ s victory and prolong the war . In the meantime , the correlation between the most effective fighters and the most brutal ones grew stronger , eventually to the point that one group began holding territory and attracting recruits from around the world . By doing enough to avoid accusations of doing nothing , the U.S. poured fuel on a fire that might have extinguished itself — and watched as others poured on more .
The main problem with U.S. policy toward Syria is not that the administration did too little early in the conflict . It is that the administration did too much . If the U.S. and its partners had not intervened , Assad would have stamped out the civil war before it began . A brutal dictator would have retained control of his country , but the death toll would be lower , Syria would be more stable , the refugee crisis might not have happened , and ISIL might never have taken its current form . When we look at Iraq and Libya , we see obvious examples of the unintended consequences of intervention . We should see that when we look at Syria , too .

The recent tragedies in Orlando, Istanbul, Dhaka, Baghdad, Medina and Nice — like the related ones coming — all have roots in Syria. Conventional wisdom holds that if the United States had done more to affect the course of Syria's civil war, the Islamic State terrorist group might never have taken hold, Syrian President Bashar Assad might have been defeated, and the scale of the war might have been far smaller. According to this argument, the terrorist attacks that fill our headlines are the results of failed policy.

But the conventional wisdom is wrong. Providing lethal aid early would have made matters worse, accelerating the war rather than slowing it. What no one wants to see today, because so few saw it at the time, is that there was another policy that could have prevented the chaos now consuming the region. The U.S. and its partners could have, and should have, let Assad win.

In contrast, the U.S. found itself in a catch-22. By attacking Assad it would help extremist rebels; by attacking extremist rebels it would help Assad. Unwilling to back either party, and without a plausible alternative, the U.S. had no clear goal. And thus no clear strategy. The administration believed it could keep its hands clean by not intervening militarily. Meanwhile, the body count continued to rise.

In this context, Washington chose a third way. When President Obama called on Assad to step down in August of 2011, he invested the U.S. in the dictator’s defeat without changing policy on the ground to facilitate that outcome. The possibility of Assad winning the war outright was no longer on the table, and U.S. acquiescence to a political solution in which Assad remained became more difficult. To do something, the U.S. imposed additional sanctions on the Syrian government, froze Syrian assets under U.S. control, prohibited commercial ties with Damascus, and blocked the import of Syrian oil.

There were other actions too. The U.S. helped to establish supply routes and funneled money, intelligence, and non-lethal aid to handpicked rebels, many of whom would later change sides. Physical supplies included communications equipment, night vision goggles, bullet proof vests, pickup trucks, food, medicine, and more. Most damaging, the U.S. and its partners did little to prevent states like Qatar and Saudi Arabia from sending vast sums of materiel and money to Assad’s opposition, including its most extreme elements. Turkey faced little pressure to control its border, even as thousands of militants flooded into Syria to join the war.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

It was clear that none of this would be decisive, but it was also clear that these steps would prevent Assad’s victory and prolong the war. In the meantime, the correlation between the most effective fighters and the most brutal ones grew stronger, eventually to the point that one group began holding territory and attracting recruits from around the world. By doing enough to avoid accusations of doing nothing, the U.S. poured fuel on a fire that might have extinguished itself — and watched as others poured on more.

The main problem with U.S. policy toward Syria is not that the administration did too little early in the conflict. It is that the administration did too much. If the U.S. and its partners had not intervened, Assad would have stamped out the civil war before it began. A brutal dictator would have retained control of his country, but the death toll would be lower, Syria would be more stable, the refugee crisis might not have happened, and ISIL might never have taken its current form. When we look at Iraq and Libya, we see obvious examples of the unintended consequences of intervention. We should see that when we look at Syria, too.

US opposition politicians and aid agencies have questioned a decision by President Donald Trump to cut off aid to three Central American states.

Mr Trump ordered the suspension of aid payments to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to push their governments to stop migration into the US.

Critics say the decision will hurt programmes that already aim to persuade people to stay at home.

Congress may seek to stop the aid being redirected elsewhere.

US officials say the immigration system at the border with Mexico is already at breaking point yet the administration wants to increase the number of asylum seekers sent back over the border fivefold - from 60 a day to 300.

There has been a huge increase in asylum seekers fleeing violence in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. The three nations are where most of the migrants on the US southern border come from.

President Trump has also said he is likely to close the border if Mexico does not do more to stop migrants crossing.

How much money is being cut?

""We are carrying out the President's direction and ending FY [fiscal year] 2017 and FY 2018 foreign assistance programs for the Northern Triangle,"" a state department spokesperson was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency, declining to give further details.

According to the Washington Post, at stake is nearly $500m (£383m) in 2018 funds plus millions more left over from the previous fiscal year. A Reuters source put the overall figure at about $700m.

In 2017, Guatemala received over $248m while Honduras received $175m and El Salvador $115m.

""I've ended payments to Guatemala, to Honduras and El Salvador,"" Mr Trump told reporters on Friday.

""No money goes there anymore... We were paying them tremendous amounts of money and we're not paying them any more because they haven't done a thing for us.""

What impact could the cuts have?

Aid advocates argue that the best way to stem migration from the region is to stimulate economic development and reduce violence there, and that it is too early to judge the impact of the aid, which was boosted in 2016 under President Barack Obama.

Cutting off aid is ""shooting yourself in the foot"", Adriana Beltrán, director of citizen security at the Washington Office on Latin America human rights research group, was quoted as saying by the New York Times.

But that policy is likely to be strongly tested this year , national security insiders say , with the world watching warily to see whether the administration ’ s “ maximum pressure ” approach manages to contain Tehran or triggers a dangerous escalation as Mr. Trump heads into his fourth year in office and a likely tumultuous reelection campaign .
Even before a deadly year-end clash between U.S. forces and Iran-allied militia groups in Iraq , plus the killing Friday of the head of Iran ’ s Quds Force , some longtime Middle East watchers were expressing concern that ramped-up U.S. sanctions and military pressure against the Iranian regime are on the verge of unleashing a new wave of chaos and violence in the region .
U.S. airstrikes against a militia base , followed this week by a two-day siege of the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad , have top administration officials warning Iran against crossing the line while expressing pessimism that Tehran has received the message .
“ There are some indications out there that [ Iran and its proxies ] may be planning additional attacks , ” Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said Thursday . “ If we get word of attacks , we will take preemptive action as well to protect American forces , protect American lives . The game has changed . ”
Iran seems wary but defiant . Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told reporters in Tehran this week , “ If anyone threatens our nation ’ s interests , we will fight back without any hesitation . ”

The Trump administration showed no sign of being intimidated by such threats as Iraqi state TV broadcast Friday that Gen. Qassem Soleimani had been killed in an airstrike at Baghdad International Airport . Three Iraqi officials told reporters in Baghdad that the strikes also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis , the deputy commander of the Iran-backed Popular Mobilization Forces .
Mr. Trump apparently celebrated the strike on Twitter , posting an image of a U.S. flag shortly after the deaths were reported Thursday evening U.S. time .
Sen. Christopher Murphy , Connecticut Democrat and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee , called Mr. Soleimani “ an enemy of the United States ” but cautioned on Twitter that “ did America just assassinate , without any congressional authorization , the second most powerful person in Iran , knowingly setting off a potential massive regional war ? ”
Many conservative analysts applaud the Trump administration ’ s determination over the past two years to coerce Iran into behaving — as Mr. Esper and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have put it — like “ a normal nation . ”
“ It ’ s indisputable at this point that the Trump administration ’ s maximum pressure campaign is working toward the goal of potentially bringing the Iranian regime back to the negotiating table in a way the administration wants , ” said Michael Pregent , a former U.S. intelligence officer now with the Hudson Institute in Washington .
The pressure campaign , he said , has been so successful “ that it is also having the secondary effect — maybe even a stumbling-into-success effect — of actually weakening the regime through protests across the region to a point that it could actually collapse . ”
Mr. Pompeo and other top Trump advisers say the administration is not seeking “ regime change ” in Tehran , but rather negotiations with Iranian leaders for a more far-reaching accord than the 2015 nuclear deal .
The agreement , which was also signed by Britain , France , Germany , China and Russia , eased international sanctions on Tehran in exchange for new limits on its nuclear activities .
But the U.S. wants to address what it calls the full range of “ malign ” activities , including Tehran ’ s backing of militant proxies in Iraq , Syria , Lebanon and Yemen — and ballistic missile tests that Washington contends violate U.N. Security Council resolutions both before and after the 2015 nuclear deal .
The pursuit of fresh talks over the past two years has proved elusive , with sporadic waves of U.S.-Iranian brinkmanship . The situation escalated early last summer in the wake of the Trump administration ’ s imposition of a global embargo on Iranian crude oil and designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps — an elite Iranian military unit — as a terrorist organization .
In the past year , Iran launched a campaign against shipping in the Persian Gulf and downed an American surveillance drone , Mr. Trump canceled a planned retaliatory airstrike in August at the last minute and imposed more U.S. sanctions targeting top Iranian officials and institutions , and Saudi Arabian oil facilities were hit with a stunning missile attack that the U.S. and its European allies blamed on Iran .
European efforts to keep the 2015 nuclear deal alive were undercut by secondary U.S. sanctions that made many international businesses reluctant to deal with Iran , and Tehran methodically breached its commitment to the 2015 deal to pressure the Europeans into more concessions .
Washington leveled fresh sanctions on an inner circle of Ayatollah Khamenei officials while gradually beefing up U.S. military assets in the region . Most notably , the White House deployed 3,000 U.S. personnel and advanced missile defense systems to Saudi Arabia and announced a further deployment in the wake of the embassy attack in Baghdad this week .
The outbreak of large demonstrations in Lebanon and Iraq , where protesters lamented Iranian influence , has added another twist in recent months . Hawkish U.S. analysts are calling on Washington to seize the opportunity presented by rising anti-Tehran sentiment in the region .
Such calls grew when protests suddenly hit dozens of cities inside Iran in November after Tehran announced a 300 % increase in heavily subsidized fuel prices . By early December , the situation had snowballed into the most violent anti-regime uprising in Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution .
The regime has cracked down fiercely . U.S. officials say Iran ’ s internal security services may have “ murdered ” more than 1,000 protesters . The crackdown may have been a sign of the regime ’ s sustained power , but some saw the widespread protests as an indication that it could be toppled from within .
“ Trump administration officials know this , and so they are making public statements to stand with Iranian protesters , ” Mr. Pregent said . “ In that sense , the language coming from the administration is that of embracing the opportunity at hand , which is regime change — even though the actual policy continues to be to try and find a way to negotiate with the existing Iranian regime . ”
“ If Iran were to break out into massive demonstrations that become violent — and I suppose that ’ s the administration ’ s hope that they will become violent and the government in Tehran won ’ t be able to successfully scare people away — then you end up with a sort of Arab Spring situation , ” said Joshua Landis , who heads the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma .
“ Obviously , everyone would like a sort of Tunisian outcome to such a situation , ” said Mr. Landis , referring to the emergence of a democratic government in that North African nation after popular uprisings nearly a decade ago .
“ But we ’ ve seen throughout the Middle East that most outcomes are not Tunisia ; they ’ re more like Syria or something much messier , ” Mr. Landis said . “ Iran , hopefully , is more of a stable state [ but ] when you do maximum pressure , you don ’ t know what ’ s going to come out the other side . ”
Mr. Trump ’ s “ maximum pressure ” policy , he predicted , “ is going to force Iran to escalate . The chances of Iran ever withdrawing from its malignant foreign policy in any way that would be noticed by the U.S. , I think , is zero . ”
Others go further . Philip H. Gordon and Robert Malley , both of whom worked on Middle East policy in the Obama administration , said the emergence of a more benign government in Tehran is possible , but it is “ also one of the current protests ’ least likely outcomes . ”
“ As cases such as Cuba , North Korea , and Iraq have demonstrated all too well , economic strangulation — even when harsh and maintained for years or decades — does not have a great record in leading to regime collapse , ” the two wrote in a recent analysis published by Foreign Policy .
“ Iran ’ s history and its actions during the current crisis leave little doubt that the regime will stop at virtually nothing to remain in power , ” they wrote . “ Beyond risks of an internal crackdown , there is every reason to fear that further steps to asphyxiate Iran ’ s economy will backfire even in terms of the White House ’ s stated goals : to moderate Iran ’ s regional behavior and compel it to agree to more stringent nuclear restraints . ”
Mr. Pregent said election-year politics will influence impending strategy choices by the Trump administration and Iranian leaders .
“ The Trump administration needs to be careful during the coming months not to cave to any internal desire to embrace a negotiation [ with Iran ] just so the president has that to run on for reelection next November . Now is not the time to legitimize the Iranian regime , ” Mr. Pregent said in an interview .
If Iran believes Mr. Trump will win a second term , “ they may become desperate and seek to negotiate with Trump because they know that if he wins the reelection , his maximum pressure policy will only become harder and more effective going forward , ” Mr. Pregent said . “ At the same time , the Iranians may seek to wait Trump out on the hope he loses and that a Democrat administration in 2021 seeks to walk back the maximum pressure campaign and return to the Obama-era nuclear deal .
“ This is a delicate situation for the regime . If it engages in violence or provocations [ like the Saudi oil attacks ] , that could trigger a feeling among Democrats that Iran needs to be contained , ” he said . “ This could bolster Democratic support for Trump ’ s maximum pressure posture in the short term . In the longer term , it could undermine any Iranian strategy of waiting Trump out in the hope a Democrat in the White House might embrace a softer Iran policy in 2021 . ”
Mr. Landis predicts little change to the tense status quo .
“ In six months , I think we ’ re still where we are now , ” he said . “ I think the Iranian regime is not going to crack .

If it engages in violence or provocations [like the Saudi oil attacks], that could trigger a feeling among Democrats that Iran needs to be contained,” he said. “This could bolster Democratic support for Trump’s maximum pressure posture in the short term. In the longer term, it could undermine any Iranian strategy of waiting Trump out in the hope a Democrat in the White House might embrace a softer Iran policy in 2021.”

Mr. Landis predicts little change to the tense status quo.

“In six months, I think we’re still where we are now,” he said. “I think the Iranian regime is not going to crack. This U.S.-Iran standoff is going to go on for a long time, [and] maximum pressure is not going to solve it.”

Boehner: History will judge us not on whether we ended wars, but how we ended them

Three weeks ago, I had the privilege of visiting our civilian leaders and military commanders, as well as our troops, in Afghanistan. It was my fourth trip to the country and a vastly different one than my first visit in 2007.

Flying over Kabul at night, I was struck by the changes: Electric lights and even traffic are visible throughout the valley. I was encouraged by what I saw and by what I heard from Ambassador James Cunningham and General Joseph F. Dunford, Jr.

The Afghans are taking the lead for their own security, and now they are poised to successfully transition to a new government for the first time in their history.

After 13 years, I am often asked why Afghanistan still matters. The world is growing more complicated by the day, and, in my view, more dangerous. The responsibility is on leaders in Washington to remind the American people why finishing the job right in Afghanistan remains important.

The explanation is straightforward: Not only was it the location from which the 9/11 attack that killed 3,000 Americans was planned, but the country also remains uniquely vulnerable to becoming a terrorist stronghold again if we don't complete our work to empower the Afghan people, security forces and government to protect their own country.

Rep. John Boehner

Our mission quite simply is to prevent another terrorist attack.

And, there's another reason we don't talk about much, but it remains equally important. Both friends and foes are watching to see whether America has the resolve to complete its task or if we will fall short of our mark out of fatigue or political expediency. This has ramifications not just for Afghanistan but other critical areas where America has strategic national security interests.

Make no mistake, Afghanistan remains a tough fight. The progress has been significant, but the country will continue to have setbacks. Violence, like the recent tragic shooting at a Kabul hospital, is going to continue. Terrorist organizations will continue to attempt high-profile attacks to break our resolve.

But because of the courage and sacrifices of our deployed men and women, both military and civilian, I am optimistic that we can achieve our mission successfully if Washington doesn't squander this progress.

At the time of my visit, I said that I hoped Washington and Kabul would always be worthy of the shared sacrifice and effort that our troops, the international community, and the Afghan people have made. The biggest takeaway from my visit is that of all the challenges facing our strategy for Afghanistan, the most potentially damaging and completely avoidable is quitting just short of the goal line.

It's essential that we do not repeat the same mistakes in Afghanistan that we made in Iraq. Before the end of this year, the Obama administration must reach a bilateral security agreement with the Afghan government that reinforces our commitment to the Afghan people and its security forces.

With input from our commanders on the ground, this will likely require retaining a credible, residual troop presence to help continue to thwart terrorist networks as well as provide appropriate levels of training and advice to the Afghan security forces as they continue to grow and mature into an effective, independent fighting force.

As a former small business man, I like an analogy I heard on our efforts to train and assist the Afghan Security Forces: we've helped them open for business, and now we need to ensure they have the processes and logistics in place to stay in business. Our military has a clear, understandable plan to put themselves out of business at the end of this process.

There is a shared, bipartisan legacy in Washington for Afghanistan. I am convinced history will judge both the executive branch and the legislative branch not on whether we ended wars, but how we ended them.

It is increasingly apparent that the United States left Iraq too soon, and it is with heavy hearts that we see the black flags flying in areas of Iraq where the United States expended our most precious treasure, the blood of our fellow citizens. We cannot let that happen in Afghanistan. A bilateral security agreement is critical if we're going to successfully complete the work that has been accomplished to date and to help ensure that the gains we have made are not jeopardized like they have been in Iraq.

America's foes, both state and non-state actors, are watching with great interest how we leave Afghanistan, watching to see whether we leave after securing our interests and honoring our commitments, or if we just leave.

And over the last year, our commander-in-chief has often talked more about leaving Afghanistan than how we are going to achieve our mission. We all want to bring our remaining troops home as soon as possible, but succeeding in Afghanistan is vital to our national security interests and it must take priority over any calendar dates. The President has an obligation to better make that case to the American people. And if he does, I will support him.

For more than a decade, our troops and civilian personnel have fought to bring peace and security to Afghanistan -- and to ensure it can never again be used as a safe haven for terrorists to attack the United States. Many Americans have sacrificed to secure these goals, and far too many have lost their lives or suffered life-altering wounds.

`` If you do n't get the deal you want , if you do n't get a fair deal , then you walk away , '' the President told British newspaper the Sunday Times , ahead of his three-day state visit , which kicks off on Monday .
Trump said if he were in the UK 's position he `` would n't pay '' the $ 50 billion Brexit divorce bill , adding `` it 's a tremendous number . ''
The President also repeated his suggestion -- previously made to Prime Minister Theresa May -- that the UK should sue the EU . When asked how this would work , Trump said he would have put `` on the table '' the `` mistakes made by the EU that cost the UK a lot of money and a lot of harm . ''
Trump 's visit comes at a delicate time in British politics , with Westminster in a deadlock over Brexit negotiations and the clock ticking towards an October 31 exit date .
Indeed Trump went as far as to say the government should send in the leader of the populist Brexit party , Nigel Farage , to negotiate with Brussels , calling him an `` asset to your country . ''
`` I like Nigel a lot and I think he 's got a lot to offer , '' said Trump , adding that Farage was a `` really terrific person '' who he got to know early in his political career `` when he liked my campaign and he actually came to a speech . ''
Farage was the first British politician to meet the new US President in 2016 -- the pair posed for a now famous photo together in a gold elevator at Trump Tower in New York .
Farage is a divisive figure in the UK . One of the most high-profile faces of the Leave campaign during the 2016 referendum , he recently made huge gains in the European elections with his newly-formed Brexit party .
But the Member of the European Parliament has also drawn scorn from Remain campaigners and EU leaders , with European Parliament liberal group leader Guy Verhofstadt previously calling Farage 's salary `` the biggest waste of EU resources . ''
Long-time Trump critic , London Mayor Saqdiq Khan , took a swipe at the US President on Sunday , calling him `` one of the most egregious examples of a growing global threat , '' in an interview with the Observer newspaper .
Khan said it was `` un-British '' to be rolling out the red carpet for a President `` whose divisive behavior flies in the face of the ideals America was founded upon -- equality , liberty and religious freedom . ''
`` In years to come , I suspect this state visit will be one we look back on with profound regret and acknowledge that we were on the wrong side of history , '' said the Mayor who has made no secret of his disapproval of the President .
In January last year , when Trump said he had scrapped a planned visit to the British capital because he did n't want to open the new US embassy , Khan suggested the real reason was because he would n't be welcome in the city .
After being delayed several times , Trump 's four-day official visit to the UK last year was eventually met with large protests in London and throughout the country .
The capital 's anti-Trump demonstrations featured a 20-foot `` Trump Baby '' blimp that flew outside Parliament -- having been given permission by Khan .
Khan , the first Muslim to be elected Mayor of London , has previously criticized the US president for his proposed travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries .

`` I think Boris would do a very good job , '' the President said . `` I think he would be excellent . ''
Trump also weighed in on comments by Meghan , now the Duchess of Sussex , ahead of the 2016 election -- back when she was better known as actress Meghan Markle .
Speaking on `` The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore , '' she called Trump misogynistic and said his politics were divisive , adding that she would move to Canada if he won the presidency .

Fear over where murder trail leads

Analysis by BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner in Bahrain

Saudis are describing the Khashoggi murder as their biggest crisis with Washington since the 9/11 terror attacks of 2001.

On Saturday, US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis, the plain-speaking ex-US Marine Corps general, left the audience here in no doubt about US intolerance of what happened. Both he and the Saudi foreign minister vowed to get to the bottom of who was behind this murder.

But here lies the problem for both countries. If the trail leads, as some suspect, to the all-powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, then Western governments may feel obliged to insist on his removal or else downgrade ties with Riyadh. But Saudis worry that, for all his autocratic behaviour, ""MBS"" represents their hope for a more modern, civil society.

If his power is curtailed, they fear, then hardline clerics will look to roll back many of their newfound freedoms.

What is the US saying?

Washington has tried to keep up the pressure on the Saudis to explain the death fully.

Defence Secretary Mattis said Khashoggi's death ""must concern us all"" and that the United States ""does not tolerate this kind of ruthless action to silence Mr Khashoggi, a journalist, through violence.

""Failure of any nation to adhere to international norms and the rule of law undermines regional stability at a time when it is needed most.""

President Trump has said he is ""not satisfied"" with the Saudi account. However, while he has floated the possibility of imposing sanctions. he has also stressed the importance of the two countries' ties.

Mr Trump also said it was ""possible"" the crown prince did not know about the killing.

What about Khashoggi's fiancée?

Hatice Cengiz says she has declined an invitation to the White House from President Donald Trump, accusing him of not being sincere about investigating the killing.

She told Turkish TV she thought the invitation was aimed at influencing public opinion in the US.

In a tearful television interview on Friday, Ms Cengiz recounted the day her fiancé vanished, saying she would never have let her partner enter the consulate if she had thought that the ""Saudi Arabia authorities would hatch a plot"" to kill him.

""I demand that all those involved in this savagery from the highest to the lowest levels are punished and brought to justice,"" she told Haberturk TV.

She said she had not been contacted by any Saudi officials but that she was unlikely to go to Saudi Arabia for a funeral, should Khashoggi's missing body eventually be found.

Salah Khashoggi, a dual Saudi-US citizen, had been barred from leaving Saudi Arabia because of his father's criticism of the country's leadership, but this sanction was recently lifted.

How do other key powers see the situation?

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has called on the Saudis to reveal who ordered the killing and to say where the body is.

foreign_policy,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/19/ileana-ros-lehtinen-obamas-futile-overtures-to-cub/,OPINION: Obama’s futile overtures to Cuba,2014-12-19,Ileana Ros-Lehtinen,"President Obama ’ s argument for unilaterally reversing U.S.-Cuba policy rests on the false premise that engagement with dictators and terrorists will somehow get them to change their ways .
This irresponsible deal does not hold the Castro regime accountable as they have made no commitments to expand democratic principles on the island . In fact , the opposite is true : Raul Castro can continue his dictatorial ways without giving in an inch while the White House gave Mr. Castro all the concessions he wanted . Typical of the administration , the desire for a deal — any deal — was stronger than the interest in its contents .
Although it is welcome news that Alan Gross is back with his family in the United States , it is worth noting that he should have never been in jail in the first place . It was clear in the days following Mr. Gross ‘ arrest that the Castro brothers wanted to trade Mr . Gross for the Cuban Five . The administration ’ s false equivalency in this swap failed to acknowledge that Mr . Gross was , in essence , a hostage while the Cuban Five spies , who endangered American national security , received full due process including trial by jury .
Time and again , the Obama administration stated they would not swap Mr . Gross for the Cuban Five spies . Unsurprisingly , the administration reneged on its word and commuted the sentences of three convicted spies in exchange for Mr . Gross . The president not only snatched justice away from the families of the slain Brothers to the Rescue heroes , who consisted of three American citizens and one U.S. resident , but he is continuing down the dangerous avenue he began with the Bergdahl exchange to signal to our adversaries the value of holding American citizens as tools for obtaining concessions from the United States .
One critical component missing from this misguided deal with a communist regime is a voice for the freedom-loving people of Cuba . Ever since the deal was announced , leaders of the pro-democracy efforts in Cuba have denounced this one-sided deal . One leader of the largest resistance coalition in Cuba , Jorge Luis Garcia Perez “ Antunez , ” stated : “ This is a betrayal that leaves the democratic opposition defenseless . Obama has allied himself with the oppressors and murderers of our people. ” The administration ’ s actions are a slap in the face for the millions of Cubans on the island and also those in the Cuban-American community who have worked for generations to restore freedom on the island .
In 2009 , the president first opened the door to more tourism travel to the island , but the opening for democracy that the president aimed for never came .

President Obama’s argument for unilaterally reversing U.S.-Cuba policy rests on the false premise that engagement with dictators and terrorists will somehow get them to change their ways.

This irresponsible deal does not hold the Castro regime accountable as they have made no commitments to expand democratic principles on the island. In fact, the opposite is true: Raul Castro can continue his dictatorial ways without giving in an inch while the White House gave Mr. Castro all the concessions he wanted. Typical of the administration, the desire for a deal — any deal — was stronger than the interest in its contents.

Although it is welcome news that Alan Gross is back with his family in the United States, it is worth noting that he should have never been in jail in the first place. It was clear in the days following Mr. Gross‘ arrest that the Castro brothers wanted to trade Mr. Gross for the Cuban Five. The administration’s false equivalency in this swap failed to acknowledge that Mr. Gross was, in essence, a hostage while the Cuban Five spies, who endangered American national security, received full due process including trial by jury.

Time and again, the Obama administration stated they would not swap Mr. Gross for the Cuban Five spies. Unsurprisingly, the administration reneged on its word and commuted the sentences of three convicted spies in exchange for Mr. Gross. The president not only snatched justice away from the families of the slain Brothers to the Rescue heroes, who consisted of three American citizens and one U.S. resident, but he is continuing down the dangerous avenue he began with the Bergdahl exchange to signal to our adversaries the value of holding American citizens as tools for obtaining concessions from the United States.

One critical component missing from this misguided deal with a communist regime is a voice for the freedom-loving people of Cuba. Ever since the deal was announced, leaders of the pro-democracy efforts in Cuba have denounced this one-sided deal. One leader of the largest resistance coalition in Cuba, Jorge Luis Garcia Perez “Antunez,” stated: “This is a betrayal that leaves the democratic opposition defenseless. Obama has allied himself with the oppressors and murderers of our people.” The administration’s actions are a slap in the face for the millions of Cubans on the island and also those in the Cuban-American community who have worked for generations to restore freedom on the island.

In 2009, the president first opened the door to more tourism travel to the island, but the opening for democracy that the president aimed for never came. There have been more than 8,400 political arrests in Cuba at the hands of Mr. Castro’s security forces in 2014, and the administration’s has even issued a travel advisory for Cuba that states: “U.S. citizens traveling to Cuba should be aware that the Cuban government may detain anyone at any time for any purpose, and should not expect that Cuba’s state security or judicial systems will carry out their responsibilities according to international norms.”

The increased travel promoted by the administration will only serve as a propaganda coup for the Castro regime. At a time when the Castro regime is suffering due to spiraling economies in Venezuela and Russia, they have turned to Mr. Obama for help through increased travel as an economic lifeline. Even with almost all the countries in the world trading with Cuba, the economic situation on the island continues to deteriorate, not because of the U.S. embargo but because of the disastrous economic policies of Raul Castro.

The administration continues to highlight the fact that the Cuban regime has decided to engage with the International Committee of the Red Cross, but this is another ruse by the president. In reality, we know that the Red Cross will not have access to Mr. Castro’s gulags and will not be able to monitor prison conditions. The administration calls a success the fact that 53 political prisoners will be released but does not articulate what will happen when the Castro regime puts more people back in jail, evidenced by the recent crackdown of more than 200 arrests on the island on International Human Rights Day on Dec. 10.

The fundamental recurring theme is that the Castro regime will not change their oppressive tactics and will not loosen their grip on the island. Mr. Obama’s recent announcement of plans to ease restrictions is kowtowing to the Castro brothers and gives them all the concessions on the regime’s wish list. It is our role as the world’s lone superpower to uphold democratic values and be the guardian of freedom everywhere, not only where it is convenient for the president’s legacy. Mr. Obama’s policy of dictator engagement has undermined the national security of the United States that sets a dangerous precedent that emboldens other desperate, sanctioned regimes. It is now the role of the legislative branch to oppose this overreach of executive action and reaffirm the need to continue defending freedom and democracy everywhere in the world.

foreign_policy,Fox Online News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/08/04/foreign-policy-pragmatism-required-for-obamas-final-two-years-keep-mowing-grass/,OPINION: Foreign policy pragmatism required for Obama’s final two years: Keep mowing the grass,2014-08-04,"Pete Hegseth, Friends Weekend","In 2008 and 2009 , Barack Obama gave two foundational foreign policy speeches , first in Berlin as the Democratic presidential candidate and then in Cairo as the newly minted president of the United States . With his signature self-assuredness , on full display he declared : “ any world order that elevates one nation or group of people over another will inevitably fail . ”
I point to these speeches , which are worth rereading , not to rebut his foreign policy , or even to argue with it , but to bury it .
Flush with platitudes , both speeches were devoid of serious substance ; Obama never had a real foreign policy , as later attempts to coin “ lead from behind ” and “ don ’ t do stupid sh * t ” doctrines laid bare . The false promise of the Obama approach to foreign affairs—cooperation , understanding , and “ international community ” —has instead led to chaos , undermining our allies , and an international march of Islamists and despots .
On Obama ’ s watch , only one foreign policy maxim has held consistently true : abdicating American leadership by neutering American power .
Obama cut his political teeth amongst the “ blame America first ” crowd ; where America is the problem , not the solution . His speeches hedge on this notion , but the manifestation of his policies hold true : U.S. power around the globe has ebbed , the world has grown more restive , and the number of “ hot spots ” has skyrocketed .
Al Qaeda 2.0 has established an ambitious and brutal “ Islamic State ” in Iraq , erasing hard-won gains ; Afghanistan is poised to go over the same cliff as the administration rushes for the exits ; Iran continues to pursue a game-changing bomb , while eagerly funding terror against Israel ; Putin ’ s Russia displays increasing belligerence ; Libya , Syria , Gaza—in flames . The list goes on .
Conservatives have rightly spent years pointing to the dangers of Obama ’ s unilateral disarmament , noting that American weakness—absent another international guarantor of freedom—invites aggression . That argument is now over—the president ’ s critics , at home and abroad , are correct in their measure of the man .
That leaves conservatives—scarred from the Iraq War for the right and wrong reasons—seeking an alternative vision of what U.S. foreign policy could be in 2017 ( George Will ’ s call for “ conservative internationalism ” is a recent example ) . The contours of a “ conservative foreign policy ” will be intensely debated for the next few years , a development we should welcome .
But as we start that conversation , we also need to deal with a more pressing issue : what to do in the next two years , as a pragmatic and loyal opposition , to prevent the world from slipping even further into chaos ?
For the remainder of Obama ’ s presidency , we can ’ t expect coherence in dealing with foreign challenges . Instead , we should work to keep the free world from imploding before America can re-arrive on the scene .

With his signature self-assuredness, on full display he declared: “any world order that elevates one nation or group of people over another will inevitably fail.”

I point to these speeches, which are worth rereading, not to rebut his foreign policy, or even to argue with it, but to bury it.

Flush with platitudes, both speeches were devoid of serious substance; Obama never had a real foreign policy, as later attempts to coin “lead from behind” and “don’t do stupid sh*t” doctrines laid bare. The false promise of the Obama approach to foreign affairs—cooperation, understanding, and “international community”—has instead led to chaos, undermining our allies, and an international march of Islamists and despots.

[pullquote]

On Obama’s watch, only one foreign policy maxim has held consistently true: abdicating American leadership by neutering American power.

Obama cut his political teeth amongst the “blame America first” crowd; where America is the problem, not the solution. His speeches hedge on this notion, but the manifestation of his policies hold true: U.S. power around the globe has ebbed, the world has grown more restive, and the number of “hot spots” has skyrocketed.

Al Qaeda 2.0 has established an ambitious and brutal “Islamic State” in Iraq, erasing hard-won gains; Afghanistan is poised to go over the same cliff as the administration rushes for the exits; Iran continues to pursue a game-changing bomb, while eagerly funding terror against Israel; Putin’s Russia displays increasing belligerence; Libya, Syria, Gaza—in flames. The list goes on.

Conservatives have rightly spent years pointing to the dangers of Obama’s unilateral disarmament, noting that American weakness—absent another international guarantor of freedom—invites aggression. That argument is now over—the president’s critics, at home and abroad, are correct in their measure of the man.

That leaves conservatives—scarred from the Iraq War for the right and wrong reasons—seeking an alternative vision of what U.S. foreign policy could be in 2017 (George Will’s call for “conservative internationalism” is a recent example). The contours of a “conservative foreign policy” will be intensely debated for the next few years, a development we should welcome.

But as we start that conversation, we also need to deal with a more pressing issue: what to do in the next two years, as a pragmatic and loyal opposition, to prevent the world from slipping even further into chaos?

For the remainder of Obama’s presidency, we can’t expect coherence in dealing with foreign challenges. Instead, we should work to keep the free world from imploding before America can re-arrive on the scene. Our approach should be pragmatic, clear-eyed, and centered on the national security interests of America and our allies.

In short, we should fight to ensure America keeps “mowing the lawn.” As this administration willfully sits on the porch of history and sips a beer, the seeds of international radicalism are exploding. We don’t have time to wait for ideological pesticides or economic weed-control—we need to cut the grass now, before it engulfs the entire lawn.

foreign_policy,Newsmax - Opinion,2,https://www.newsmax.com/andrewnapolitano/charter/2020/01/09/id/949065/,Strike on Iran General Was Lawless,2020-01-09,Andrew Napolitano,"`` America . . . goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy . ''
Last week , President Donald Trump ordered the U.S. military to invade a then-friendly country without the knowledge or consent of its government and assassinate a visiting foreign government official . The victim was the head of Iran 's military and intelligence .
The formerly friendly country is Iraq . The killing of the general and his companions was carried out by the use of an unmanned drone . The general was not engaged in an act of violence at the time he was killed , nor were any of his companions .
They were driving on a public highway in a van .
The president 's supporters have argued that the general 's death was revenge for Americans and others killed by the general 's troops and surrogates . Trump has argued , more importantly , that he ordered the general 's death because of what evil the general might order his own troops and surrogates to do in the future .
Can the president legally kill a person not engaged in an act of violence because of what the person might do in the future ?
The president has taken an oath to uphold the Constitution .
The Constitution provides only two means for the federal government to kill a human being . The first is pursuant to a declaration of war , which only Congress can do . That permits the president to use the military to kill the troops of the government of the country against which war has been declared .
The second way that the Constitution permits federal government killings is pursuant to due process . That means that the person to be killed is lawfully in custody , has been properly charged , lawfully tried and fairly convicted of a capital crime , and the conviction has been upheld on appeal .
Can the president kill foreign military personnel and claim the justification of self-defense ?
The laws of war permit him to do that , but self-defense — actually , defense of the country — only comes into play when the foreign military personnel are physically engaged in killing Americans or are certainly about to do so . That justification only applies — the law here is 600 years old and has been consistently applied — when force is imminent and certain .
Were imminence and certainty not the requirement , then nothing would prevent a president from slaying any monster he chose simply based on a fear that the monster might someday strike . Such a state of affairs is contrary to two presidential executive orders , one issued by President Gerald R. Ford and the other by President Ronald Reagan , and neither negated by Trump .
Such a territorial invasion and killing also violate the United Nations Charter — a treaty that prohibits unlawful invasions and killings of member nations ' territories and officials outside of a lawful and U.N. approved declaration of war .
Roaming the world looking for monsters to slay not only violates long-standing principles of American domestic and international law , but also it violates basic Judeo-Christian moral principles , which teach that the end does not justify the means and might does not make right .
Think about it .

—President John Quincy Adams (1767-1848)

Last week, President Donald Trump ordered the U.S. military to invade a then-friendly country without the knowledge or consent of its government and assassinate a visiting foreign government official. The victim was the head of Iran's military and intelligence.

The formerly friendly country is Iraq. The killing of the general and his companions was carried out by the use of an unmanned drone. The general was not engaged in an act of violence at the time he was killed, nor were any of his companions.

They were driving on a public highway in a van.

The president's supporters have argued that the general's death was revenge for Americans and others killed by the general's troops and surrogates. Trump has argued, more importantly, that he ordered the general's death because of what evil the general might order his own troops and surrogates to do in the future.

Can the president legally kill a person not engaged in an act of violence because of what the person might do in the future?

In a word: No.

Here's is the backstory:

The president has taken an oath to uphold the Constitution.

The Constitution provides only two means for the federal government to kill a human being. The first is pursuant to a declaration of war, which only Congress can do. That permits the president to use the military to kill the troops of the government of the country against which war has been declared.

Congress has not declared war on Iran.

The second way that the Constitution permits federal government killings is pursuant to due process. That means that the person to be killed is lawfully in custody, has been properly charged, lawfully tried and fairly convicted of a capital crime, and the conviction has been upheld on appeal.

Can the president kill foreign military personnel and claim the justification of self-defense?

The laws of war permit him to do that, but self-defense — actually, defense of the country — only comes into play when the foreign military personnel are physically engaged in killing Americans or are certainly about to do so. That justification only applies — the law here is 600 years old and has been consistently applied — when force is imminent and certain.

Were imminence and certainty not the requirement, then nothing would prevent a president from slaying any monster he chose simply based on a fear that the monster might someday strike. Such a state of affairs is contrary to two presidential executive orders, one issued by President Gerald R. Ford and the other by President Ronald Reagan, and neither negated by Trump.

Such a territorial invasion and killing also violate the United Nations Charter — a treaty that prohibits unlawful invasions and killings of member nations' territories and officials outside of a lawful and U.N. approved declaration of war.

Roaming the world looking for monsters to slay not only violates long-standing principles of American domestic and international law, but also it violates basic Judeo-Christian moral principles, which teach that the end does not justify the means and might does not make right.

Think about it. If the American president can kill an Iranian government official in Iraq because of fear of what he might do -- without a declaration of war or any legal process —can the Chinese president kill a Mexican government official visiting in Texas or an American intelligence agent encouraging revolution in Venezuela for fear of what they might do?

This is not a fanciful or academic argument. It not only goes to the fidelity to the rule of law that we require of our leaders in order to maintain personal liberty and limited government, it also goes to our safety. We have laws to prevent wanton killings, lest killers turn on us.

In Robert Bolt's play ""A Man for All Seasons,"" Sir Thomas More argues with his son-in-law, William Roper, about the extent of the law's protections of those universally recognized as evil.

Roper says that he would cut down all the laws in England to get rid of the Devil.

More counters that even the Devil is entitled to the benefits of the law. Then he hurls this zinger: ""And, when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round on you?— where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? This country's planted thick with laws from coast to coast--man's laws, not God's — and, if you cut them down — and you're just the man to do it — d'you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I'd give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake.""

More crystalized the dangers of those who — like Trump — take the law into their own hands for the sake of expedience or to rid the world of a monster. Without law, how does one decide what monsters should go and what monsters may stay?

When President Obama used drones to kill peaceful uncharged Americans in Yemen, candidate Donald Trump condemned that behavior. He offered that as president, he would bring the troops home, stop the nation building, quit being the world's police force and end the endless wars.

Instead, his act of state terrorism has succeeded in doing what the general he killed could never do while alive. Trump has united the Iranian people behind their fanatical government, and he caused the Iraqi government to kick out all American troops — troops that had no lawful or moral basis for being there in the first place and whose numbers have only increased.

Trump cut down the laws to get to the Devil. Whom will he kill next?

Iranian diplomats have said they would pull out of the talks if the U.S. imposes new sanctions on their country.

Marco Rubio scored a huge hit on the Republican debate stage in Miami on Thursday night, with strident rhetoric on the subject of Barack Obama’s reopening of relations with Cuba.

The Florida senator, the son of Cuban migrants, is seeking to win the Florida primary on Tuesday and thus rescue his flagging campaign for the White House.

He was asked about Obama’s trip later this month to Cuba, which is still governed by the communist Castro regime. Rubio was asked why the United States should not engage further with Cuba.

Rubio said the US changes had allowed money to flow to the Castro regime, and added: “Nothing will change for the Cuban people … In fact things are worse, than they were before this opening.”

The only result of “the opening”, he said, was that the Cuban government had more sources of money.

It was a huge applause line.

Donald Trump, who leads Rubio comfortably in polls in Florida, had previously said on the campaign trail that opening Cuba was fine. Under attack in the Miami debate from all the candidates who trail him in the polls and the mounting delegate count, he said “I want a much better deal with Cuba” and repeated a familiar line: “We don’t make any good deals.”

“I do agree that something should take place,” he added. “After 50 years it’s enough time, folks. But we have to make a good deal here.”

In response, Rubio rattled down a list of anti-Castro grievances and was applauded wildly again, drowning out attempts to ask Senator Ted Cruz – the son of a Cuban father and an American mother – the next question.

Would you break diplomatic relations with Cuba, Cruz was asked.

“Yes I would,” Cruz says.

Cruz said the question illustrated “a real difference between us” on foreign policy. Trump, Cruz said, supports the “same basic trajectory” of policy as Obama and Hillary Clinton, when Obama’s first secretary of state, have established.

John Kasich, the fourth man onstage, was asked if he would encourage US companies to do business with Cuba. Kasich said he would not.

Trump, meanwhile, repeated: “We would not do the deal unless it would be a very good deal for us.”

JERUSALEM — President Barack Obama is still testing the waters on Mideast peace — but John Kerry can’t wait to dive in.

And Kerry, long used to getting to call his own shots, now has to wait for his new boss to say how deep he can go.

Story Continued Below

The president said repeatedly before and during his trip here that he believes in the peace process — but he believes as well that that the Israelis and Palestinians will need to show some flexibility before he gets much more involved. As strong as his pro-peace remarks have been during the trip, they haven’t changed the president’s reluctance to get stung by another failed effort at peace like he did during his first term.

The secretary of state sees making a deal happen as a critical part of his new job — and while Obama has plenty of other foreign and domestic issues that could cement his legacy, brokering Mideast peace is the rare kind of diplomatic achievement that could put Kerry in the history books.

So far, Obama seems willing to allow Kerry to take a whirl, so long as he keeps a low profile and doesn’t generate a political backlash. But the president still hasn’t done much to answer the key question of how much of his own political capital he’ll put into the effort.

US President Donald Trump is approving the sale of billions of dollars' worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia, citing Iranian threats to its arch rival.

Mr Trump invoked a rarely used aspect of federal law to push through the $8bn (£6bn) deal - bypassing Congress.

He did so by declaring that ongoing tensions with Iran amounted to a national emergency.

The move has angered those who fear the weapons may be used against civilians in Yemen by Saudi-led forces.

Some Democrats accused the president of bypassing Congress because the sale of weapons - including precision-guided bombs - would have been strongly opposed on Capitol Hill.

""[Iran's] activity poses a fundamental threat to the stability of the Middle East and to American security at home and abroad,"" he wrote.

He said the transfers ""must occur as quickly as possible in order to deter further Iranian adventurism in the Gulf and throughout the Middle East"".

The move quickly garnered opposition. Democratic Senator Robert Menendez, who sits on the Foreign Relations Committee, accused Mr Trump of ""granting favours to authoritarian countries"".

Senior Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said the US needed to rein in Saudi Arabia rather than hand it more weapons.

Why are there tensions with Iran?

Tensions between the US and Iran began rising this month when Washington put pressure on countries still buying from Iran by ending exemptions from sanctions. The decision was intended to bring Iran's oil exports to zero, denying the government its main source of revenue.

Mr Trump reinstated the sanctions last year after abandoning the landmark nuclear deal that Iran has signed with six nations - the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and Germany.

Iran has now announced it it will suspend several commitments under the deal.

There has also been a spike in tensions in the Gulf more widely.

Four oil tankers were damaged in what the United Arab Emirates (UAE) said were sabotage attacks while drone attacks on two oil pumping stations in Saudi Arabia by Yemen's Houthi rebels - who are supported by Iran - forced the temporary closure of a pipeline.

Though I was a private citizen , whose personal opinions on such matters was not sought , I nonetheless publicly expressed my private doubts about the invasion .
By way of proof , Trump cited an interview with FOX ’ s Neil Cavuto , conducted several months before the invasion , and about which he recalled saying the following lines : “ Perhaps [ we ] shouldn ’ t be doing it yet , ” and “ the economy is a much bigger problem . ”
Over on the internet , Trump ’ s contention that he was publicly against the invasion was met with immediate derision . Among the sources cited to the contrary was Politifact , which as recently as June 22nd rated Trump ’ s campaign statements about his opposition to the war as “ false , ” and concluded :
We searched newspaper articles and television transcripts from 2002 and 2003 amid the debate leading up to the Iraq War . We didn ’ t find any examples of Trump unequivocally denouncing the war until a year after the war began .
The site did , however , link to a 2002 interview with Howard Stern , in which Trump was asked whether he supported the looming invasion and responded “ Yeah , I guess so. ” Surprising exactly no one , Trump did not mention this interview in his speech on Monday .
Buzzfeed , meanwhile , had already posted much of the same Neil Cavuto interview—giving Trump ’ s quote some context . When read fully , his position on the Iraq invasion circa 2001 seems less averse and more ambivalent , if not plainly disinterested :
Well , I ’ m starting to think that people are much more focused now on the economy . They are getting a little bit tired of hearing , We ’ re going in , we ’ re not going in , the—you know , whatever happened to the days of Douglas MacArthur ? He would go and attack . He wouldn ’ t talk . We have to —you know , it ’ s sort like either do it , or don ’ t do it .
As far as the cautionary foresight that Trump had been touting ?

I was an opponent of the Iraq war from the beginning—a major difference between me and my opponent. Though I was a private citizen, whose personal opinions on such matters was not sought, I nonetheless publicly expressed my private doubts about the invasion.

By way of proof, Trump cited an interview with FOX’s Neil Cavuto, conducted several months before the invasion, and about which he recalled saying the following lines: “Perhaps [we] shouldn’t be doing it yet,” and “the economy is a much bigger problem.”

Over on the internet, Trump’s contention that he was publicly against the invasion was met with immediate derision. Among the sources cited to the contrary was Politifact, which as recently as June 22nd rated Trump’s campaign statements about his opposition to the war as “false,” and concluded:

We searched newspaper articles and television transcripts from 2002 and 2003 amid the debate leading up to the Iraq War. We didn’t find any examples of Trump unequivocally denouncing the war until a year after the war began.

The site did, however, link to a 2002 interview with Howard Stern, in which Trump was asked whether he supported the looming invasion and responded “Yeah, I guess so.” Surprising exactly no one, Trump did not mention this interview in his speech on Monday.

Buzzfeed, meanwhile, had already posted much of the same Neil Cavuto interview—giving Trump’s quote some context. When read fully, his position on the Iraq invasion circa 2001 seems less averse and more ambivalent, if not plainly disinterested:

Well, I’m starting to think that people are much more focused now on the economy. They are getting a little bit tired of hearing, We’re going in, we’re not going in, the—you know, whatever happened to the days of Douglas MacArthur? He would go and attack. He wouldn’t talk. We have to —you know, it’s sort like either do it, or don’t do it.

As far as the cautionary foresight that Trump had been touting?

This is his full quote from the Cavuto interview:

Well, [the president] has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps shouldn’t be doing it yet, and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know. He’s under a lot of pressure. He’s—I think he’s doing a very good job.

“Do it or don’t do it,” is not the same thing as “don’t do it.” And, “I think the president is doing a very good job,” is not the same thing as “the president is taking the country to war and I believe it is wrong.”

Apparently impervious to this reality, Trump continued onwards in his storytelling about the events surrounding September 11, listing the many ways in which he had been righter, and wiser, than those in power. If the Iraq invasion had been a mistake, then its aftermath had been a gross miscalculation of epic proportions.

USA TODAY

The United Nations General Assembly voted overwhelmingly Thursday to repudiate President Trump's controversial declaration recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Trump threatened to withhold aid in retaliation for a vote condemning his position.

The U.N. body voted 128-9 to declare Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital ""null and void."" Thirty-five nations abstained.

The measure, drafted by U.S. ally Egypt, urges nations to support U.N. resolutions dating to 1967 — when Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan — that call for Jerusalem’s status to be decided through negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians.

Israel says a united Jerusalem will remain its capital, while Palestinians want it to cede East Jerusalem as the capital of a future, independent Palestinian state. Only a handful of countries recognize Jerusalem as the Israeli capital, while most others maintain embassies in Tel Aviv.

The resolution says “that any decisions and actions which purport to have altered, the character, status or demographic composition of the Holy City of Jerusalem have no legal effect, are null and void and must be rescinded in compliance with relevant resolutions of the Security Council.”

Trump warned Wednesday that the vote could impact “billions of dollars” in U.S. aid.

“Let them vote against us, we’ll save a lot,” Trump said. “We don’t care. This isn’t like it used to be where they could vote against you and then you pay them hundreds of millions of dollars and nobody knows what they’re doing.”

Americans are “tired of being taken advantage of” at the U.N. “and we’re not going to be taken advantage of any longer,” Trump said.

Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticized Trump for threatening to cut off U.S. funding to countries that oppose his decision. “Mr Trump, you cannot buy Turkey’s democratic will with your dollars. Our decision is clear,” Erdogan said at a cultural awards ceremony in Ankara on Thursday.

U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said, “no vote in the United Nations will make any difference” on the U.S. decision to move its embassy to Jerusalem, which will go ahead because “it is the right thing to do.”

“We will remember it when we are called upon once again to make the world’s largest contribution to the United Nations,” Haley said. “And we will remember when so many countries come calling on us, as they so often do, to pay even more and to use our influence for their benefit.”

Trump’s Dec. 6 announcement also said the State Department had been ordered to begin the years-long process of moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. Trump said the decision, following a law passed by Congress in 1998, does not impact the borders of Jerusalem, but reflected the reality that Israel considers the city its capital.

His announcement was widely condemned in capitals around the world, and provoked deadly protests in the Middle East.

It seems he did so — but in a way that makes the problem worse , not better .
That ’ s because Trump appears to have accepted Putin ’ s denials of any election interference at face value , even though the entire US intelligence community believes the Kremlin mounted a sophisticated campaign to help him win the White House .
And the damage doesn ’ t stop there : According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov , Trump told Putin that some in the United States were “ exaggerating ” how much Russia affected the election ’ s outcome — effectively dragging Moscow into Trump ’ s partisan wars here at home .
This development is the most interesting and important to come out of the Trump-Putin meeting . Effectively , Russia got what it wanted out of this encounter — namely , the appearance that the Trump administration accepts that the Kremlin didn ’ t interfere in the election .
Hanging over the entire meeting was the question of whether Congress would pass sanctions on Russia as punishment for its election meddling . Trump noted the possibility that they may be enacted soon , but also told the Russian leader that he ’ d like to move past that issue . “ The president took note of the actions that have been discussed by the Congress , ” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said . “ But I think the two presidents — I think rightly — focused on how do we move forward ? ”
So Putin got Trump to buy his fake news on election interference and to offer a weak endorsement of upcoming sanctions .
It goes to show how much preparation matters . Trump barely had any notes or talking points heading into the meeting ( he also didn ’ t have a hotel room , by the way ) . Putin , by contrast , came in ready to go as he famously does . My ███ colleague Yochi Dreazen explains :
A senior member of George W. Bush ’ s Cabinet once told me a revealing story about Vladimir Putin . Each meeting , the official said , began the same way : Putin would reach into his suit jacket pocket , remove notecards listing perceived American sins against Russia , and read them one by one . Only then would the substantive discussions begin .
After the meeting , it seems like Putin got what he was looking for . That was always the likely outcome , anyway .
As the New York Times reported , Russia figured Putin would emerge as a winner regardless of what actually took place at the meeting . One option was that nothing of substance would come out of the talks , after which the Kremlin could paint Trump as a weak leader . The other was that Trump agreed to work with Russia , making the US president look feckless because of how Russia has defied America in Ukraine , in Syria , and during the election .
“ It is a win-win situation for Putin , ” Andrei V. Kolesnikov , a political analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Center , told the Times .
It also didn ’ t help that Trump ’ s focus was elsewhere . Early this morning , Trump tweeted that “ everyone ” at the summit was talking about why former Hillary Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta hadn ’ t handed over the Democratic National Committee ’ s server to the FBI and CIA ( that seems , to be generous , highly unlikely ) .
Podesta , who is in the middle of a cross-country trip with his wife , chimed in after the fact , calling Trump a “ whack job ” and telling him to get his “ head in the game . ”
That said , Trump and Putin came away with one agreement : a ceasefire in Syria ’ s southwest . That ’ s all well and good , but most of the fighting is in Syria ’ s east and north — particularly in the ISIS de facto capital of Raqqa . Much of the country ’ s southwest has already been flattened , so it ’ s not readily apparent what the ceasefire will achieve .
Still , what most will take out of the first face-to-face encounter between the two men is that America ’ s leader bought the Kremlin ’ s denials of election meddling , facts be damned .
Trump , in other words , may have done more damage by meeting with Putin than he would have done by staying home .","President Trump’s top aides have been hemming and hawing for days about whether Trump would use today’s high-profile meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin to hammer Moscow for its election meddling.

That’s because Trump appears to have accepted Putin’s denials of any election interference at face value, even though the entire US intelligence community believes the Kremlin mounted a sophisticated campaign to help him win the White House.

And the damage doesn’t stop there: According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Trump told Putin that some in the United States were “exaggerating” how much Russia affected the election’s outcome — effectively dragging Moscow into Trump’s partisan wars here at home.

This development is the most interesting and important to come out of the Trump-Putin meeting. Effectively, Russia got what it wanted out of this encounter — namely, the appearance that the Trump administration accepts that the Kremlin didn’t interfere in the election.

Hanging over the entire meeting was the question of whether Congress would pass sanctions on Russia as punishment for its election meddling. Trump noted the possibility that they may be enacted soon, but also told the Russian leader that he’d like to move past that issue. “The president took note of the actions that have been discussed by the Congress,” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said. “But I think the two presidents — I think rightly — focused on how do we move forward?”

So Putin got Trump to buy his fake news on election interference and to offer a weak endorsement of upcoming sanctions.

Trump — the dealmaker — got outplayed by Putin.

Preparation matters. The problem is that Trump wasn’t prepared.

It goes to show how much preparation matters. Trump barely had any notes or talking points heading into the meeting (he also didn’t have a hotel room, by the way). Putin, by contrast, came in ready to go as he famously does. My Vox colleague Yochi Dreazen explains:

A senior member of George W. Bush’s Cabinet once told me a revealing story about Vladimir Putin. Each meeting, the official said, began the same way: Putin would reach into his suit jacket pocket, remove notecards listing perceived American sins against Russia, and read them one by one. Only then would the substantive discussions begin.

After the meeting, it seems like Putin got what he was looking for. That was always the likely outcome, anyway.

As the New York Times reported, Russia figured Putin would emerge as a winner regardless of what actually took place at the meeting. One option was that nothing of substance would come out of the talks, after which the Kremlin could paint Trump as a weak leader. The other was that Trump agreed to work with Russia, making the US president look feckless because of how Russia has defied America in Ukraine, in Syria, and during the election.

“It is a win-win situation for Putin,” Andrei V. Kolesnikov, a political analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Center, told the Times.

It also didn’t help that Trump’s focus was elsewhere. Early this morning, Trump tweeted that “everyone” at the summit was talking about why former Hillary Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta hadn’t handed over the Democratic National Committee’s server to the FBI and CIA (that seems, to be generous, highly unlikely).

Podesta, who is in the middle of a cross-country trip with his wife, chimed in after the fact, calling Trump a “whack job” and telling him to get his “head in the game.”

That said, Trump and Putin came away with one agreement: a ceasefire in Syria’s southwest. That’s all well and good, but most of the fighting is in Syria’s east and north — particularly in the ISIS de facto capital of Raqqa. Much of the country’s southwest has already been flattened, so it’s not readily apparent what the ceasefire will achieve.

Still, what most will take out of the first face-to-face encounter between the two men is that America’s leader bought the Kremlin’s denials of election meddling, facts be damned.

Trump, in other words, may have done more damage by meeting with Putin than he would have done by staying home.",www.vox.com,left,Wr4kvSxWXSyBQ8Zf

The prominence of Russian-made helicopters in Bashar Assad 's brutal and desperate efforts to hang on to power puts the Syrian war in a new light . It 's getting difficult to categorize the conflict simply as a humanitarian crisis or a `` teacup war '' of secondary significance . Rather , Syria 's civil war is increasingly fought under a great-power cloud that has n't been seen in the Middle East for decades .
Most of Washington would rather ignore the darkening forecast . In one of his periodic Washington Post op-eds , Henry Kissinger warned that a `` Syrian intervention risks upsetting [ the ] global order . '' While Kissinger went on to acknowledge that the fall of Assad 's regime would suit the national interests of the United States in both humanitarian and strategic terms , he concluded that an armed intervention would fail to meet his two tests for U.S. involvement . First , there was no consensus on what kind of regime would replace Assad 's . Second , there was no assurance that the `` political objective '' — call it `` victory '' — could be achieved `` in a domestically sustainable time period . ''
In short , Kissinger spoke in the voice of regretful realism . From this perspective , the Syrian civil war is an unfortunate event , a human catastrophe , a strategic opportunity to remove a regime that 's been a longtime pest , but , if it requires a serious and enduring American commitment , not a reason to upset the international order .
This appears to reflect the thinking of the Obama administration . The president said last August that the time had come for Assad `` to step aside , '' but has yet to do anything to force the issue .
The problem with this sort of realism is that it is n't really realistic , insofar as it fails to appreciate the balance of power . If Assad stays , the global order will be very much affected , and one of the most significant features of the post-Cold War order will be threatened . In particular , the United States ' ability to push for fundamental political change in the greater Middle East with a free hand will be severely curtailed . The Syrian crisis then is a big deal , not only in the region , but also in global terms .
Once upon a time , the Middle East was thought to be a square on the Cold War chessboard , part of the larger `` game of thrones '' with the Soviet Union . The United States had to curry favor with a host of regional autocrats , lest the Russians accumulate a larger roster of thugs . Washington had the Shah 's Iran and Saudi Arabia , Moscow had a natural rapport with Baath party bosses in Syria and Iraq , and the Egyptians teased both sides until they satisfied their honor in the 1973 war with Israel — itself a conflict that sparked a nerve-racking U.S.-Soviet faceoff . The Carter Doctrine , formulated in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , held that the United States would resist the efforts of any outside power to dominate the region .
With the collapse of the Soviet Union , the great game in the Middle East changed profoundly , even though American security interests did not . Saddam Hussein thought that the end of the Cold War gave him a green light to invade Kuwait , but he discovered that the Carter Doctrine had been expanded to apply to bids for hegemony that came from inside the region as well .
Still , during the decade following Operation Desert Storm , the United States opted to contain Iraq rather than depose Saddam . A safe haven was established for Kurds in the north , and `` no-fly '' zones were maintained in the north and the south , with a `` no-drive '' zone in the south to protect Kuwait . Substantial U.S. air and land forces remained in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia , with naval forces elsewhere in the Gulf . Keeping Saddam `` in his box '' meant staying in his face . Thus by the time Operation Iraqi Freedom started in 2003 , Iraq 's air defenses had already been suppressed , making the decisive march to Baghdad a three-week sprint . Likewise , in Afghanistan , the need for `` regime change '' had supplanted past predilections for containment .
Although George W. Bush did little to push the `` friendly '' autocrats in Egypt or the Persian Gulf states to reform , he was willing to back his `` forward strategy of freedom in the Middle East '' with American military power to see through the regime-change commitments already made . President Barack Obama , on the other hand , has sought to shelter himself and the United States from the winds of change in the Middle East . This is the theme that runs from his `` New Beginnings '' address at Cairo University in June 2009 , to his response to Iranian protests , through his Iraq and Afghanistan policies , to his standoffish approach to the uprisings of the Arab Spring , to `` leading from behind '' in Libya , and now to the Syria crisis .
As he explained in Cairo , Obama believes this is a `` time of great tension between the United States and Muslims around the world '' that is `` rooted in historical forces that go beyond any current policy debate . '' Obama 's prime directive was to reestablish `` mutual interest '' and `` mutual respect '' between the United States and Muslim peoples , and to assert that `` no system of government can or should be imposed upon one nation by any other . '' He promised also to be `` respectful of the sovereignty of nations '' and to engage in negotiations with Iran `` without preconditions and on the basis of mutual respect . ''
Ironically , as Obama yearned for the `` engagement '' and realpolitik of a bygone era , the Muslims of the greater Middle East yearned for political change . Less than 10 days after the Cairo address , Iranians took to the streets to protest what they believed was a stolen election . The White House went silent . Iranian protesters responded by chanting , `` Obama ! Obama ! Either you are with us or with them ! '' Hoping for a deal to slow Iran 's nuclear program , the administration kept its open hand extended to the mullahs even during Tehran 's crackdown .
Obama 's response to the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011 was equally uncertain , even regarding the revolt in Libya , which the White House now counts as one of its foreign policy successes . In February 2011 , protesters in Benghazi and elsewhere surged into the streets , and by early March , the administration declared that Qaddafi had `` lost his legitimacy to lead , and must go . '' But just as a no-fly zone was established , the administration announced that the United States would fall back into a supporting role once NATO assumed command . The president welcomed getting rid of Qaddafi but added that `` broadening our military mission to include regime change would be a mistake . '' The administration would countenance regime change , but did n't want too many American fingerprints on it , and certainly no responsibility for what might come after .
The Syria conflict — now officially designated as a `` civil war '' by the U.N. 's peacekeeping chief — has similarly paralyzed Obama , and with far greater consequences . After the uprising began in March 2011 , it became apparent that Russia and China would prevent any repeat of the Libya resolution at the U.N . They permitted a nonbinding peace plan drafted by former secretary general Kofi Annan , which has had no effect whatsoever , and a condemnation of the regime 's indiscriminate use of heavy weaponry . In short , for the first time since the end of the Cold War , U.S. Middle East policy is once again subject to larger great power issues , and in this case , what amounts to a de facto veto by Moscow , backed by Beijing .
This week 's contretemps over the Syrian use of Russian-made attack helicopters underscores both the emerging proxy war character of the conflict and the Obama administration 's unwillingness to consider effective measures . Specifically , the White House has refused to back the Syrian opposition against an Iranian ally in a war that is ongoing , is certain to continue , is likely to expand , and whose outcome will matter .
`` We have confronted the Russians about stopping their continued arms shipments to Syria , '' Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said last week . The attack choppers would `` escalate the conflict quite dramatically , '' she contended , rightly . Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov countered that it was only sending weapons for `` self-defense . '' No regrets . In fact , the Russians are extremely pleased with themselves — they 're being courted just as in the Soviet days .
The Chinese have tried to remain in Moscow 's shadow , but they are equally opposed to taking actions that would put the Assad regime in jeopardy . This is not just the usual Chinese whinging over `` sovereignty .

Speaking at the White House , Trump said that while a `` permanent ceasefire '' will be tough to maintain in the volatile region , he hopes it will last and end the conflict between Turkey and the Kurds .
`` I do believe it will be permanent , '' he said . `` This was an outcome created by us , the United States , and nobody else ... we 've done something very , very special . ''
'PERMANENT ' TURKEY-SYRIA CEASE-FIRE POSSIBLE AS TEMPORARY PEACE AGREEMENT ENDS , PENCE SAYS
Trump delivered the statement amid bipartisan criticism over his recent decision to pull back U.S. forces from northern Syria , opening the door for Turkey to launch a military offensive . But the administration has sought to halt the fighting . The ceasefire required Kurdish forces formerly allied with the U.S. against the Islamic State group to move out of a roughly 20-mile zone on the Turkish border . With Kurdish forces out of the zone , Turkey will halt its assault , Trump said .
`` We 've saved the lives of many , many Kurds , '' he added .
Trump added that if Turkey breaches the cease-fire , the sanctions could be reimposed .
`` The sanctions are lifted unless something happens that we 're not happy with , '' he added .
Trump 's statement follows an early morning tweet , where he announced a “ safe zone ” along the Turkey-Syria border , and voiced optimism after the initial 120-hour pause in the Turkish military operation there ended .
“ Ceasefire has held and combat missions have ended . Kurds are safe and have worked very nicely with us , ” Trump tweeted . “ Captured ISIS prisoners secured . ”
The U.S. withdrawal was followed immediately by Turkish aggression , and Trump faced criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike who blamed him for allowing the violence to go unchecked and leaving Kurdish allies to fend for themselves . Turkey and Russia reached an agreement Tuesday that would transform the map of northeast Syria , installing their forces along the border and filling the void left by the abrupt withdrawal of U.S. troops .
Trump said Wednesday that nearly all U.S. troops will be leaving Syria but some will remain to safeguard oil fields in Syria . Russian forces have already begun joint patrols with Turkish forces along the Turkish-Syrian border .
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan met with Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Ankara last week to work out the initial cease-fire . Though that period has since lapsed , Pence said earlier there 's an opportunity for a permanent cease-fire in the region .
James Jeffrey , a career diplomat who oversees Washington ’ s role in the global fight against the Islamic State , also told lawmakers on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he does not believe the troop withdrawal added to Turkey ’ s decision to invade northern Syria . Jeffrey , however , did concede that if U.S. forces had been told to stand their ground amid a Turkish invasion , Turkey may have thought otherwise about crossing the border .
IRAQ 'S MILITARY SAYS US TROOPS LEAVING SYRIA DO N'T HAVE PERMISSION TO STAY IN THE COUNTRY
Under the recent 10-point deal , Russia and Turkey have given Kurdish fighters 150 hours starting at noon Wednesday — meaning , until next Tuesday at 6 p.m. — to withdraw from the border .
Russian and Syrian government forces would move into that area immediately to ensure the Kurdish fighters pull back 20 miles from the border . Then at the end of the 150 hours , Russian-Turkish patrols would begin along a six-mile-wide strip of the border .
The exception would be the region around the town of Qamishli at the far eastern end of the border , which has some of the densest Kurdish population .
Russian spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said , according to Russian newswires , that if the Kurds do not complete their withdrawal by the Tuesday deadline , Turkey would resume their offensive .
“ It ’ s quite obvious that if the Kurdish units don ’ t withdraw with their weapons then Syrian border guards and Russian military police will have to step back . And the remaining Kurdish units will be steamrolled by the Turkish army , '' Peskov said .","President Trump announced Wednesday that conditions have been met between Turkey and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) for what he called a ""permanent ceasefire"" between the two sides and that the United States is lifting sanctions on Ankara that were implemented following the invasion of northern Syria.

James Jeffrey, a career diplomat who oversees Washington’s role in the global fight against the Islamic State, also told lawmakers on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he does not believe the troop withdrawal added to Turkey’s decision to invade northern Syria. Jeffrey, however, did concede that if U.S. forces had been told to stand their ground amid a Turkish invasion, Turkey may have thought otherwise about crossing the border.

IRAQ'S MILITARY SAYS US TROOPS LEAVING SYRIA DON'T HAVE PERMISSION TO STAY IN THE COUNTRY

Under the recent 10-point deal, Russia and Turkey have given Kurdish fighters 150 hours starting at noon Wednesday — meaning, until next Tuesday at 6 p.m. — to withdraw from the border.

Russian and Syrian government forces would move into that area immediately to ensure the Kurdish fighters pull back 20 miles from the border. Then at the end of the 150 hours, Russian-Turkish patrols would begin along a six-mile-wide strip of the border.

The exception would be the region around the town of Qamishli at the far eastern end of the border, which has some of the densest Kurdish population.

Russian spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, according to Russian newswires, that if the Kurds do not complete their withdrawal by the Tuesday deadline, Turkey would resume their offensive.

“It’s quite obvious that if the Kurdish units don’t withdraw with their weapons then Syrian border guards and Russian military police will have to step back. And the remaining Kurdish units will be steamrolled by the Turkish army,"" Peskov said.

Trump will travel for his second session with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un to discuss whether the strongman might relinquish his nuclear weapons in return for an end to economic isolation .
Skeptics call it a fool ’ s errand . But even some harsh critics of Trump ’ s foreign policy hold open the possibility that the president might find it easier to deal with the diminutive Asian tyrant than with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
At a minimum , the Hanoi summit offers Trump a chance to shift a losing political narrative which dates back to the drubbing his party took in November ’ s midterm elections .
“ A lot of positive things are going on , ” Trump insisted in a Friday White House news conference mostly devoted to his frustration that Congress had denied him on the border wall funding he ’ d long demanded . “ We ’ re working on a summit , ” he added , predicting that it “ will be a very successful one . ”
If so , the summit could be a step towards a historic diplomatic achievement that becomes central to his 2020 reelection pitch . But another high-profile failure could leave Trump looking dangerously ineffectual .

“ If he has another summit with Kim Jong Un that doesn ’ t really lead to something more serious than what we ’ ve seen so far , having had the debacle of the negotiation with the Congress , it starts to chip away at his mantra that ‘ I alone can fix it ’ and ‘ I ’ m the greatest deal-maker of all time , ’ ” said Eric Edelman , a former top Pentagon official under President George W. Bush .
“ Democrats are likely to say he pisses off our friends , cozies up to our enemies and can ’ t negotiate out of a paper bag , much less ‘ The Art of the Deal , ’ ” Edelman said . If Trump secures real concessions from Kim , he added , the president “ can make a plausible case that his methods are unorthodox — but he ’ s gotten results . ”
While Trump allies concede the partial government shutdown was a setback for the president , they dismiss talk of a winter of discontent , noting that Trump ’ s Gallup approval rating has bounced from 37 percent during the shutdown to 44 percent this week — just 2 points below his winning 2016 election total .
Insisting there is no serious damage to repair , they say they are measuring the Hanoi summit on its national security merits — as a test of whether North Korea , one of the world ’ s most dangerous regimes , can be persuaded to give up a nuclear program it developed at the cost of decades of deprivation and isolation .
One Republican close to the White House argued that any implications for the president ’ s standing are mainly on the upside . Most Americans don ’ t pay attention to the details of nuclear diplomacy and are more likely to focus on a stunning success than a continued stalemate .
“ I think it ’ s simple : If it ’ s a success , they ’ ll tout it . If it ’ s not , they won ’ t , ” said a Republican close to the White House . “ It ’ s historic and incredible if it works . It ’ s a setback if it doesn ’ t . ”
Skeptics have long scoffed at the possibility that Trump can persuade Kim to give up his nuclear arsenal , arguing that the North Korean leader is playing to Trump ’ s vanity — including by sending him fawning letters that Trump proudly shows off to Oval Office visitors — while slowly chipping away at his international pariah status .
Those critics note that Trump ’ s previous summit with Kim , in Singapore last June , was more a media spectacle than a sober diplomatic exchange and produced only a vague statement of shared goals . While Trump declared it an unqualified success , his administration scaled back expectations weeks before the meeting after the North Koreans rejected a written U.S. proposal laying out a road map for the “ complete , verifiable , and irreversible ” denuclearization that Trump officials have demanded .
But at least one leading authority on nuclear strategy concedes that Trump might , almost by accident , crack one of the hardest and most dangerous international problems in generations .
“ This is not normal diplomacy . But this is not a normal president . Maybe in spite of himself , he has some pretty brilliant ideas , ” said Graham Allison , a longtime nuclear strategist at Harvard University .
Trump “ is more like what Kim is . Kim looks at social media , watches a basketball game , watches some stupid movie . He is communicating to this young man in ways he may understand better than a lecture from me , ” Allison added .
Optimists point to recent evidence that Trump ’ s special representative to North Korea , Stephen Biegun has been gaining traction . After initially struggling to secure meetings with his North Korean counterparts following his August appointment , Beigun has had more success and has raised his profile in an empowering way . Diplomats and experts took note of a photo Trump tweeted from the Oval Office on Christmas Eve showing Biegun , along with National Security Council official Allison Hooker , standing beside the Resolute desk discussing North Korea .
“ Christmas Eve briefing with my team working on North Korea — Progress being made , ” Trump wrote . “ Looking forward to my next summit with Chairman Kim ! ”
Joel Wit , a senior fellow at the Stimson Center who helped negotiate a 1994 U.S. nuclear agreement with North Korea , called the picture an “ important signal ” to the North Koreans “ that Biegun can actually see the president of the United States — and that ’ s not a given . ”
In an address at Stanford University last month , Biegun announced that the North Koreans have taken preliminary steps to dismantle two sites used for missile and nuclear testing and have committed to destroying their plutonium and uranium enrichment facilities .
“ We ’ re seeing a gradual evolution of the positions on both sides , which is an encouraging sign , ” Wit said . “ Certainly there ’ s a recognition that the substantive outcomes have to be more than they were at the first summit . I feel like this is going to be better . ”
Administration officials said they expect to leave Hanoi with a road map for North Korea ’ s denuclearization that outlines a series of steps each side can commit to undertaking in order to achieve that goal . Biegun hinted at this approach in his remarks , telling the audience at Stanford that the North Koreans were prepared to take action contingent upon “ the United States taking corresponding measures . ”
Some experts hope that Trump will walk away if this summit fails . “ At least from what I understand from dealing with this administration , they will walk away , and I hope that they will walk away if they don ’ t get something this time , ” said David Albright , president of the Institute for Science and International Security .
But in his news conference Friday , Trump seemed to have the highest hopes for his meeting with Kim .
Trump even declared that Japan ’ s prime minister , Shinzo Abe , had nominated him for the Nobel Prize in appreciation of his nuclear diplomacy .
Abe “ gave me the most beautiful copy of a letter that he sent to the people who give out a thing called the Nobel Prize . He said , ‘ I have nominated you respectfully on behalf of Japan. ’ I said , ‘ Thank you , many other people feel that way too , ’ ” Trump said .
That claim puzzled analysts who note that Tokyo has concerns that the president ’ s apparent eagerness to cut a deal with Kim could leave unaddressed Japanese concerns about North Korea ’ s short-range missile program .
Even if Trump isn ’ t awarded — or even actually nominated — for a Nobel Prize , he is likely to cast himself as a peacemaker .
“ I believe he would ’ ve gone to war with North Korea , ” Trump said of President Barack Obama , with whom he discussed the North Korean threat before he took office . “ I think he was ready to go to war , in fact he told me he was so close to starting a big war with North Korea , ” Trump said . “ Now where are we now ? No missiles , no rocks , no nuclear testing . We ’ ve learned a lot . ”","North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un (right) walks with President Donald Trump during a break in talks at their U.S.-North Korea summit in Singapore on June 12, 2018.

“A lot of positive things are going on,” Trump insisted in a Friday White House news conference mostly devoted to his frustration that Congress had denied him on the border wall funding he’d long demanded. “We’re working on a summit,” he added, predicting that it “will be a very successful one.”

If so, the summit could be a step towards a historic diplomatic achievement that becomes central to his 2020 reelection pitch. But another high-profile failure could leave Trump looking dangerously ineffectual.

“If he has another summit with Kim Jong Un that doesn’t really lead to something more serious than what we’ve seen so far, having had the debacle of the negotiation with the Congress, it starts to chip away at his mantra that ‘I alone can fix it’ and ‘I’m the greatest deal-maker of all time,’” said Eric Edelman, a former top Pentagon official under President George W. Bush.

“Democrats are likely to say he pisses off our friends, cozies up to our enemies and can’t negotiate out of a paper bag, much less ‘The Art of the Deal,’” Edelman said. If Trump secures real concessions from Kim, he added, the president “can make a plausible case that his methods are unorthodox — but he’s gotten results.”

While Trump allies concede the partial government shutdown was a setback for the president, they dismiss talk of a winter of discontent, noting that Trump’s Gallup approval rating has bounced from 37 percent during the shutdown to 44 percent this week — just 2 points below his winning 2016 election total.

Insisting there is no serious damage to repair, they say they are measuring the Hanoi summit on its national security merits — as a test of whether North Korea, one of the world’s most dangerous regimes, can be persuaded to give up a nuclear program it developed at the cost of decades of deprivation and isolation.

One Republican close to the White House argued that any implications for the president’s standing are mainly on the upside. Most Americans don’t pay attention to the details of nuclear diplomacy and are more likely to focus on a stunning success than a continued stalemate.

“I think it’s simple: If it’s a success, they’ll tout it. If it’s not, they won’t,” said a Republican close to the White House. “It’s historic and incredible if it works. It’s a setback if it doesn’t.”

Skeptics have long scoffed at the possibility that Trump can persuade Kim to give up his nuclear arsenal, arguing that the North Korean leader is playing to Trump’s vanity — including by sending him fawning letters that Trump proudly shows off to Oval Office visitors — while slowly chipping away at his international pariah status.

Those critics note that Trump’s previous summit with Kim, in Singapore last June, was more a media spectacle than a sober diplomatic exchange and produced only a vague statement of shared goals. While Trump declared it an unqualified success, his administration scaled back expectations weeks before the meeting after the North Koreans rejected a written U.S. proposal laying out a road map for the “complete, verifiable, and irreversible” denuclearization that Trump officials have demanded.

But at least one leading authority on nuclear strategy concedes that Trump might, almost by accident, crack one of the hardest and most dangerous international problems in generations.

“This is not normal diplomacy. But this is not a normal president. Maybe in spite of himself, he has some pretty brilliant ideas,” said Graham Allison, a longtime nuclear strategist at Harvard University.

Trump “is more like what Kim is. Kim looks at social media, watches a basketball game, watches some stupid movie. He is communicating to this young man in ways he may understand better than a lecture from me,” Allison added.

Optimists point to recent evidence that Trump’s special representative to North Korea, Stephen Biegun has been gaining traction. After initially struggling to secure meetings with his North Korean counterparts following his August appointment, Beigun has had more success and has raised his profile in an empowering way. Diplomats and experts took note of a photo Trump tweeted from the Oval Office on Christmas Eve showing Biegun, along with National Security Council official Allison Hooker, standing beside the Resolute desk discussing North Korea.

“Christmas Eve briefing with my team working on North Korea — Progress being made,” Trump wrote. “Looking forward to my next summit with Chairman Kim!”

Joel Wit, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center who helped negotiate a 1994 U.S. nuclear agreement with North Korea, called the picture an “important signal” to the North Koreans “that Biegun can actually see the president of the United States — and that’s not a given.”

In an address at Stanford University last month, Biegun announced that the North Koreans have taken preliminary steps to dismantle two sites used for missile and nuclear testing and have committed to destroying their plutonium and uranium enrichment facilities.

“We’re seeing a gradual evolution of the positions on both sides, which is an encouraging sign,” Wit said. “Certainly there’s a recognition that the substantive outcomes have to be more than they were at the first summit. I feel like this is going to be better.”

Administration officials said they expect to leave Hanoi with a road map for North Korea’s denuclearization that outlines a series of steps each side can commit to undertaking in order to achieve that goal. Biegun hinted at this approach in his remarks, telling the audience at Stanford that the North Koreans were prepared to take action contingent upon “the United States taking corresponding measures.”

Some experts hope that Trump will walk away if this summit fails. “At least from what I understand from dealing with this administration, they will walk away, and I hope that they will walk away if they don’t get something this time,” said David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security.

But in his news conference Friday, Trump seemed to have the highest hopes for his meeting with Kim.

Trump even declared that Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, had nominated him for the Nobel Prize in appreciation of his nuclear diplomacy.

Abe “gave me the most beautiful copy of a letter that he sent to the people who give out a thing called the Nobel Prize. He said, ‘I have nominated you respectfully on behalf of Japan.’ I said, ‘Thank you, many other people feel that way too,’” Trump said.

That claim puzzled analysts who note that Tokyo has concerns that the president’s apparent eagerness to cut a deal with Kim could leave unaddressed Japanese concerns about North Korea’s short-range missile program.

Even if Trump isn’t awarded — or even actually nominated — for a Nobel Prize, he is likely to cast himself as a peacemaker.

“I believe he would’ve gone to war with North Korea,” Trump said of President Barack Obama, with whom he discussed the North Korean threat before he took office. “I think he was ready to go to war, in fact he told me he was so close to starting a big war with North Korea,” Trump said. “Now where are we now? No missiles, no rocks, no nuclear testing. We’ve learned a lot.”",www.politico.com,left,blqfeP2s6rEAQuyE

Lawmakers on Capitol Hill want the Trump administration to outline a broader strategy in Syria following the president's decision to authorize U.S. missile strikes Thursday night in response to the apparent chemical weapons attack by Syrian President Bashar Assad.

""I think it was appropriate but I would like to say, despite all the enthusiasm we see this morning, if I might quote [Winston] Churchill, 'It's the end of the beginning, not the beginning of the end,' "" Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., told MSNBC on Friday morning.

He added: ""We have a Middle East in chaos, the Europeans being destabilized, the spread of [the Islamic State] throughout the world. This is the challenge of Bashar al-Assad, and then we have also got the challenge of ISIS, so there's a lot more to go.""

Speaking on the Senate floor, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R.-Ky., urged the administration to collaborate, and elaborate, on where the strategy goes from here. ""In the days ahead, I am committed to working with the administration to continue developing a counter-ISIL strategy that hastens the defeat of ISIL and establishes objectives for dealing with the Assad regime in a manner that preserves the institutions of government in an effort to prevent a failed state,"" he said.

""Making sure Assad knows that when he commits such despicable atrocities he will pay a price is the right thing to do,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said late Thursday. ""It is incumbent on the Trump administration to come up with a strategy and consult with Congress before implementing it.""

Senators were scheduled to hold a classified briefing with military and intelligence officials Friday afternoon. The Senate adjourns Friday afternoon for the two-week Spring recess; the House has already left town for the break.

Questions about constitutionality

Some Democrats, and at least two Republicans, are questioning the strikes' constitutionality. The military action also is reviving debate over Congress' role in the matter and whether the president needs to obtain congressional authorization for any prolonged military engagement in the region.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who favors a more isolationist foreign policy approach, wrote on Twitter, ""The President needs Congressional authorization for military action as required by the Constitution.""

Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., echoed Paul's remarks: ""Airstrikes are an act of war. Atrocities in Syria cannot justify departure from Constitution, which vests in Congress power to commence war.""

That notion is supported by Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif. — a prominent liberal supporter of Congress passing a new authorization for the use of military force (AUMF). On Twitter, Lee characterized the airstrikes as ""an act of war.""

Lee tweeted: ""I was the lone vote against 2001 AUMF. Syria strikes are far beyond the scope of this war authorization. Speaker Ryan needs to bring a vote.""

President Trump — like President Barack Obama before him — has launched airstrikes against ISIS targets using as legal justification the 2001 war authorization Congress passed after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. But lawmakers are split over whether that justification covers attacks against the Assad government.

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said the strike was ""appropriate and just"" and signaled that he also wants the Trump administration to consult Capitol Hill lawmakers on the matter.

MOSCOW WANTS EXPLANATION

Russia expects Tillerson to explain Washington's stance when he visits Moscow next week, Interfax news agency cited a Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman as saying.

Washington has long backed rebels fighting Assad in a multi-sided civil war that has killed more than 400,000 people and driven half of Syrians from their homes since 2011.

The United States has conducted air strikes against Islamic State, which controls territory in eastern and northern Syria, and a small number of U.S. troops are helping rebel militias.

My name ’ s Kevin . I ’ m from Australia . I ’ m here to help . ”
The silver-thatched man on the stage in a loose-fitting black suit and no tie pauses for laughter from the crowd . It ’ s March 2015 , and Kevin Rudd is delivering his first TED talk , an 18-minute guide to China ’ s post-Mao economic takeoff and the growing trepidation it stirs in Washington . Using visual cues and folksy language ( “ You see that bloke ? He ’ s French. ” ) , Mr. Rudd threads China ’ s modern journey with his own : the tale of a poor boy from rural Australia who studied Chinese history and rose to become prime minister in 2007 .
For emphasis , he draws Chinese characters with his finger on a touch screen , which is projected behind him . As with many TED talks , it ’ s a mélange of college seminar and stump speech .
Within a decade , he explains , authoritarian China will become the world ’ s largest economy , ending more than two centuries in which English-speaking democracies in the West – first Britain , then the United States – held that position . Already , China trades and manufactures more goods than any other country . With economic power go the privileges of primacy . For now , the global economy is expanding , and China is an integral part of it . Yet history is replete with examples of rising powers that , intentionally or not , spurred incumbent great powers to take up arms against it .
“ [ C ] an we carve out a future which is peaceful and mutually prosperous , or are we looking at a great challenge of war or peace ? ” Rudd asks .
Rudd the politician seems to know his audience . After laying out the mutual suspicions and fears of the US and China , he cites examples of cooperation and partnership , and proposes a peaceful path forward . To succeed , it must combine the American dream and the Chinese dream . With a final flourish , he draws a four-character phrase : a dream for all humankind .
After a bitter exit from Australian politics in 2013 that still casts a long shadow , Rudd is pursuing his own dream in this land of second acts . He spent a year as a visiting scholar at Harvard University ’ s Kennedy School of Government in Cambridge , Mass . In January he became the inaugural president of the Asia Society Policy Institute ( ASPI ) in New York . It ’ s a high-profile position that plays to his strengths as a thinker on Asia and a former statesman . At a time of fraying Sino-American ties , this straight-talking Australian has emerged as a sort of US-China “ whisperer ” – a conduit and interpreter for policymakers on both sides of the world ’ s most important bilateral relationship in the way that Henry Kissinger and Lee Kuan Yew , the late Singaporean leader , have done in the past . As Chinese President Xi Jinping prepares for his first state visit to the US later this month , Rudd offers his views on where the taut relationship between the two global powers might be going .
Mr. Xi is already provoking concern in Washington ’ s policy circles with his forthright style of diplomacy and firm grip on power . Earlier this spring , several prominent think tanks issued a tsunami of reports that bore down on the US-China strategic rivalry on issues ranging from maritime disputes to North Korea ’ s nuclear program to cyberwarfare . While their policy advice varies , as does their assessment of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the two countries , the consensus is that under Xi ’ s leadership ties are being tested in new and dangerous ways .
“ We ’ re at a tipping point in this relationship , ” says Richard Solomon , a senior fellow at RAND Corp .
If so , Rudd may be a man to watch . For now , he ’ s working on his own study on US-China relations , a summary of which was published in April by Harvard ’ s Belfer Center . In speeches and articles , he argues that despite the rancor and paranoia , common ground exists between West and East – and more can be found . “ Most of the world today is made up of folks who like blowing up bridges , or , alternatively , those that prefer shouting to bridge-building , ” Rudd told me when we met in New York in July . “ Unless you build some bridges , problems frankly become irresolvable . ”
Rudd knows firsthand the political constraints that leaders face in foreign affairs , particularly when it comes to China . He already has the ear of senior politicians , officials , and thinkers in Washington and Beijing . Having left politics , he can speak more freely , and as an Australian , he can be blunt . He makes his points “ without currying favor or offering flattery , ” says Kevin Nealer , a partner at The Scowcroft Group , an international advisory firm in Washington . Even his critics – and in Australia they are legion – concede that Rudd is a trenchant analyst of geopolitics . But in the US political arena , where toughness on China is prized and compromise equals capitulation , is anyone listening ?
The modern evolution of U.S.-China relations began in 1971 under President Richard Nixon . That year , Dr. Kissinger , his national security adviser , reached an agreement with China to normalize relations between the two countries . Nixon ’ s visit to Beijing in February 1972 ended a quarter-century of isolation from the West .
By the end of the 1970s , China had begun to reform its socialist economy ; in its place , a capitalist phoenix emerged , eager to do business with the US and other rich nations . Chinese citizens soaked up foreign ideas and fashions no longer deemed politically toxic . Many personal freedoms were restored . Some people got rich . Others made a modest living , while urging their children – in most cases , a single child – to aim higher . Opportunities for education exploded after formal schooling had been all but abandoned during Mao ’ s Cultural Revolution . More than a quarter of a million Chinese are now enrolled in US universities .
Nixon was no idealist . He saw China as a counterweight to the Soviet Union . What China did at home was a lesser concern . “ The relationship has always been strategic , ” says Jeffrey Bader , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington .
Since Nixon , successive US presidents have adopted the notion that engagement with China – trade , diplomacy , education – would eventually lead to political liberalization , as it had in some other closed regimes . In essence , the more that America knew about China , and China knew about America , the more certain it was that Western norms and practices would prevail .
By most measures , this hasn ’ t happened . Under Xi , who took power in March 2013 , civic space for critical debate has narrowed . Human rights lawyers , Christian activists , and liberal professors have all been targeted and detained as threats to single-party rule . Under Xi , whose term runs to 2023 , China ’ s growing military muscle is being flexed over disputed islands in East Asia . Its economic weight is already felt globally , from Brazil to South Africa to Australia , and that in turn is giving Beijing a greater say in global affairs .
“ Chinese power is increasing . Its economic and financial influence is increasing , and it ’ s winning a lot of deference from the world on that basis , ” says Andrew Nathan , a professor of politics at Columbia University in New York .
One example is the $ 100 billion Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank , which China launched in June with 56 other countries . The US was not among them . But close allies such as Britain , Germany , and South Korea chose to join , despite US objections to the bank ’ s lending rules . China says that the AIIB fills a gap in financing for poor countries and isn ’ t a competitor to the Washington-based World Bank . At the same time , the US is negotiating a trade pact , the Trans-Pacific Partnership , which pointedly excludes China . “ If we don ’ t write the rules , China will write the rules out in that region , ” President Obama told The Wall Street Journal in April .
Such political and economic rivalry , combined with China ’ s military buildup , raises the question of whether China may undermine the US role as guarantor of global security . In the South China Sea , China has built airstrips on disputed islands and reefs . It bristles at US Navy surveillance flights along its coastline . Further north , the Senkaku Islands held by Japan , which China calls Diaoyu and claims as its own , are also being contested .
“ It ’ s not about lumps of rock or coral , ” says Hugh White , professor of strategic studies at Australian National University in Canberra . “ It ’ s about who leads in Asia . ”
Along China ’ s rim , countries such as Australia , South Korea , the Philippines , and Japan are military allies of the US . But like all countries in Asia , their largest trading partner is now China . Should Sino-American relations turn overtly adversarial in the future , they would be forced to pick a side . For now , any sign that US allies in Asia are cozying up to China as a hedge against a perceived decline in US strength or willingness to fight could encourage Chinese hawks to push harder – and panic US military strategists . Conversely , an American move to expand its role in the region and arm its allies would spark similar reactions on the other side .
Historians call it the Thucydides Trap : a cycle of conflict that escalates when a rising power disturbs an existing order . In the 5th century BC , Sparta began to see Athens , an upstart city-state bristling with new ideas , as a rival . This led to a protracted and mutually ruinous struggle for military supremacy in ancient Greece . “ It was the rise of Athens and the fear this inspired in Sparta that made war inevitable , ” wrote Thucydides in his “ History of the Peloponnesian War . ”
Rudd clicks on a picture of Thucydides during his TED talk ( “ This guy up here ? He ’ s not Chinese , and he ’ s not American . He ’ s Greek. ” ) He highlights the research of Harvard professor Graham Allison , director of the Belfer Center . Mr. Allison has found that , since 1500 , the Thucydides Trap has been sprung 15 times . In 11 cases the result was catastrophic war , including in 1914 when Germany challenged British primacy .
Americans may find it hard to picture China as Athens , the birthplace of democracy . But Chinese policymakers , as keen students of world history , would have little trouble transposing Sparta , a superpower accustomed to dictating terms to others , onto the US . In 2013 , Xi told an international delegation , of which Rudd was a member , that China wasn ’ t seeking to impose its will on the world . “ This is not in the DNA of this country given our long cultural and historical background. ” Then Xi added , “ We all need to work together to avoid the Thucydides Trap . ”
There ’ s a saying : “ When elephants fight , the grass suffers. ” In ancient times , the grass was unruffled by the rise and fall of distant empires . In our globalized world , a stampede hurts everyone . When Josette Sheeran , president of the Asia Society , attended a summit in Ethiopia , she was seated at dinner with seven African leaders . All told her that their nations ’ future depends on constructive US-China relations . “ Every region is telling us that the US and China need to work it out , ” she says .
“ Call me Kevin , ” Rudd tells me when we meet in his surprisingly spare office at the Asia Society . In person he ’ s affable and solicitous , asking if my cup of tea is hot enough . He tells me he made it himself – the actual tea blend . When he was foreign minister , he won a tea-blending competition run by Twinings . Now , a share of profits from all sales of his Australian Afternoon Tea go to his designated charity for animal welfare . I tell him I like the tea . He looks pleased . “ I grew up on a farm in rural Australia . The culture of having a cup of tea was a defined culture , ” he says .
Rudd speaks in measured , often digressive chunks , with the cadence of a diplomat and the ellipses of a politician adept at swerving past questions . He ’ s fond of folksy Anglo-Australian metaphors . Referring to political changes in Myanmar ( Burma ) , he speaks of “ movement at the station , ” a cattle-ranching term . He also lapses into wonky bureaucratese – political “ internalities ” and “ investment instrumentalities . ”
China has defined Rudd ’ s career , for better or worse . Raised in hardscrabble rural Australia , he studied Chinese history and culture and went on to serve as a diplomat , then built a political career that culminated in him being elected Australian prime minister in a landslide victory in 2007 . While Rudd ’ s campaign was grounded in domestic politics , his credentials on China at a time when it was buying up vast amounts of Australian natural resources were clearly a selling point .
His message , says Nicholas Stuart , author of a 2007 biography of Rudd , was that “ America is the past . China is the new century . And I can unlock the door for you . ”
Three years later , Rudd was out , replaced by his deputy leader , Julia Gillard . His brusque style of leadership had alienated party colleagues and senior bureaucrats alike , and he ’ d lost public support after flip-flopping on issues such as climate change , which he once called the greatest moral challenge facing the world . At the United Nations climate talks in Copenhagen , Denmark , in 2009 , Rudd was overheard using colorful expletives about Chinese negotiators who helped sabotage a binding deal . On this and other issues involving China , Rudd frequently found himself caught between conflicting views and expectations . “ He overestimated his position and thought the Chinese would give him a lot more space ” on global warming and other issues , says Professor White , who has informally advised Rudd .
He was also hurt by the release of a WikiLeaks cable in which he struck a bellicose tone on China over a private lunch in 2009 with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .
Rudd served unhappily as foreign minister under Ms. Gillard . In 2013 he unseated her and briefly served as prime minister again before losing an election . It was a bitter end to his political career . He resigned from Parliament and accepted an offer to teach at Harvard . In September 2014 , Rudd spoke with former US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson at an Asia Society panel on China , which led to him being tapped as president of ASPI .
In Australia , many believe that Rudd is eyeing the job of UN secretary-general after Ban Ki-moon ’ s second term ends next year . The Asia Society , in proximity and prestige , is an ideal launchpad . Rudd denies that he covets the job or that he would stand a chance . The UN ’ s informal rotation system is against him : Someone from Eastern Europe is due to fill the post next . Still , Frank Brennan , a Jesuit priest and law professor at Australian Catholic University in Canberra who has known Rudd since 1990 , says he would be a candidate . “ He ’ s got another big gig in him , whatever it might be . ”
Rudd considers himself a realist on Chinese politics . In his Belfer study , he flatly rejects the idea that China ’ s brand of authoritarian capitalism is bound to fail in the future , despite its current economic travails . It would be “ imprudent in the extreme ” to assume a “ China collapse , ” he writes . “ This would amount to a triumph of hope over cold , hard analysis . ”
Boiled down , Rudd ’ s argument is that the US and China need to set aside political issues on which their positions are too far apart , such as the status of Taiwan . Instead , they should build mutual trust via joint initiatives on common problems where there is overlap while taking a “ constructive ” approach to bilateral and multilateral issues , such as reform of the UN and of Pan-Asian forums . Rudd argues that Sino-American cooperation can in time yield the political capital needed for strategic breakthroughs . Curbing the effects of climate change – Mr. Obama and Xi drew up a joint plan of action at a summit in Beijing last November – is an example of common purpose .
Rudd says his report is aimed primarily at policy elites in the US and China , and that any bluntness is intentional . “ It ’ s causing some level of discomfort in both capitals , I assume .... I ’ m not in the business of dancing around the edges , ” he says .
For US readers , Rudd deftly unspools Chinese “ realist ” thinking on the tenets of American foreign policy , namely that the US has “ a dual strategy of undermining China from within , while also containing China from without. ” Exhibit A : Obama ’ s first-term “ pivot ” to Asia and US arms sales to countries such as India and Vietnam . From China ’ s perspective , such steps are evidence of preemptive containment .
Similarly , Rudd recognizes the concerns of US strategists who fret that China seeks to create a sphere of influence in Asia that would exclude the US . Rudd notes that Xi is far more decisive and destiny-driven than his predecessors . In May 2014 , Xi outlined a regional security concept in which the US wasn ’ t welcome . “ The people of Asia are capable and wise enough to strengthen cooperation among themselves in order to achieve the peace and stability of Asia , ” he said .
The US military remains far more capable and better equipped than the Chinese military and is likely to remain so for decades . But perceptions matter . In 2013 , the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reported the findings of a survey of opinion leaders in China and the US . Majorities in both countries said they viewed the other country as a competitor . Asked if they considered China as an enemy , only 2 percent of US government elites said they did . Among Chinese , 27 percent view the US as an enemy .
Critics say Rudd ’ s engagement strategy – finding common ground and solving non-core problems – won ’ t defuse the deeper divisions . Sino-American tensions aren ’ t simply about a lack of goodwill or diplomatic mechanisms , says Ashley Tellis , a senior associate at Carnegie and coauthor of a report published in April that advocates a hawkish US stance on China . “ These are fundamental clashes of interest . There ’ s nothing in Kevin ’ s report that tells me how to circumnavigate these clashes . ”
Rudd argues that Xi may be open to a “ grand strategic bargain ” with the US on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula . Other analysts have proposed that a parallel formula be found for Taiwan , whereby the US stops selling weapons in return for a Chinese pledge not to force reunification . Mr. Bader , who was Obama ’ s principal adviser on Asia from 2009 to 2011 , is skeptical of sweeping quid pro quo deals . “ They don ’ t happen . Every issue is unique and disaggregated and has its own set of bureaucratic actors involved , ” he says .
power accommodation , too , which he likens to the 1815 Congress of Vienna . “ I think there will be a long period of friction over these particular issues . I don ’ t think they can be settled upfront by some kind of compromise . ”
Rudd doesn ’ t linger on the consequences of the US ceding ground to China in Asia . Yet even a gradual rebalancing would mark a major shift , says White , author of a 2013 book , “ The China Choice : Why America Should Share Power. ” He says Rudd needs to be frank about what it means to the US to begin to treat China as a peer . “ Kevin is trying to say you can do this and it ’ s not going to hurt . But this is going to hurt . ”
Since leaving office , Rudd has kept up his contacts in China . He attends academic gatherings and has been invited to speak at military-run events . While his Belfer study refers to “ senior Chinese interlocutors , ” Rudd is cagey about whom he meets with . “ It ’ s far better to talk to folks when you can when opportunities arise , in Beijing or Washington , but not to make a song and dance about it , ” he tells me .
In 2008 , Rudd asserted in a speech in Chinese at Peking University that he was a zhengyou , a sincere friend who would speak frankly to China . But his charm offensive flopped after WikiLeaks revealed that he also spoke frankly to America about China . In 2014 , Bob Carr , who succeeded Rudd as Australian foreign minister , wrote in a memoir that his Chinese counterpart , Wang Yi , had said of Rudd , “ You know , in China ... some people love him ... and some people ... hate him ! ”
In Washington , Rudd has cultivated policymakers on both sides of the aisle , though his personal connections are strongest among Democrats , including foreign-
policy advisers to Mrs. Clinton . In 2009 , Obama called Rudd two weeks after the president ’ s first inauguration . After he was demoted to foreign minister , Rudd continued to meet with Obama ’ s national security adviser . Rudd is still consulted on China by the Obama administration , says Mr. Nealer , who notes his briefings “ appeal to senior policymakers who crave insights without agendas . ”
While China may be the reason the White House calls , in his new position at the Asia Society , Rudd has a broad portfolio . One morning in July , I joined a small group at the launch of an ASPI task force chaired by Rudd to promote Indian membership in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation grouping . The next day , he held an hour-long teleconference briefing on Japan . On the third day , I attended a panel on the Iran nuclear deal , which drew a large crowd to the eighth floor of the Asia Society as the evening sun glanced off the platinum-priced apartments of Park Avenue nearby .

The silver-thatched man on the stage in a loose-fitting black suit and no tie pauses for laughter from the crowd. It’s March 2015, and Kevin Rudd is delivering his first TED talk, an 18-minute guide to China’s post-Mao economic takeoff and the growing trepidation it stirs in Washington. Using visual cues and folksy language (“You see that bloke? He’s French.”), Mr. Rudd threads China’s modern journey with his own: the tale of a poor boy from rural Australia who studied Chinese history and rose to become prime minister in 2007.

For emphasis, he draws Chinese characters with his finger on a touch screen, which is projected behind him. As with many TED talks, it’s a mélange of college seminar and stump speech.

Within a decade, he explains, authoritarian China will become the world’s largest economy, ending more than two centuries in which English-speaking democracies in the West – first Britain, then the United States – held that position. Already, China trades and manufactures more goods than any other country. With economic power go the privileges of primacy. For now, the global economy is expanding, and China is an integral part of it. Yet history is replete with examples of rising powers that, intentionally or not, spurred incumbent great powers to take up arms against it.

“[C]an we carve out a future which is peaceful and mutually prosperous, or are we looking at a great challenge of war or peace?” Rudd asks.

Rudd the politician seems to know his audience. After laying out the mutual suspicions and fears of the US and China, he cites examples of cooperation and partnership, and proposes a peaceful path forward. To succeed, it must combine the American dream and the Chinese dream. With a final flourish, he draws a four-character phrase: a dream for all humankind.

After a bitter exit from Australian politics in 2013 that still casts a long shadow, Rudd is pursuing his own dream in this land of second acts. He spent a year as a visiting scholar at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government in Cambridge, Mass. In January he became the inaugural president of the Asia Society Policy Institute (ASPI) in New York. It’s a high-profile position that plays to his strengths as a thinker on Asia and a former statesman. At a time of fraying Sino-American ties, this straight-talking Australian has emerged as a sort of US-China “whisperer” – a conduit and interpreter for policymakers on both sides of the world’s most important bilateral relationship in the way that Henry Kissinger and Lee Kuan Yew, the late Singaporean leader, have done in the past. As Chinese President Xi Jinping prepares for his first state visit to the US later this month, Rudd offers his views on where the taut relationship between the two global powers might be going.

Mr. Xi is already provoking concern in Washington’s policy circles with his forthright style of diplomacy and firm grip on power. Earlier this spring, several prominent think tanks issued a tsunami of reports that bore down on the US-China strategic rivalry on issues ranging from maritime disputes to North Korea’s nuclear program to cyberwarfare. While their policy advice varies, as does their assessment of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the two countries, the consensus is that under Xi’s leadership ties are being tested in new and dangerous ways.

“We’re at a tipping point in this relationship,” says Richard Solomon, a senior fellow at RAND Corp.

If so, Rudd may be a man to watch. For now, he’s working on his own study on US-China relations, a summary of which was published in April by Harvard’s Belfer Center. In speeches and articles, he argues that despite the rancor and paranoia, common ground exists between West and East – and more can be found. “Most of the world today is made up of folks who like blowing up bridges, or, alternatively, those that prefer shouting to bridge-building,” Rudd told me when we met in New York in July. “Unless you build some bridges, problems frankly become irresolvable.”

Rudd knows firsthand the political constraints that leaders face in foreign affairs, particularly when it comes to China. He already has the ear of senior politicians, officials, and thinkers in Washington and Beijing. Having left politics, he can speak more freely, and as an Australian, he can be blunt. He makes his points “without currying favor or offering flattery,” says Kevin Nealer, a partner at The Scowcroft Group, an international advisory firm in Washington. Even his critics – and in Australia they are legion – concede that Rudd is a trenchant analyst of geopolitics. But in the US political arena, where toughness on China is prized and compromise equals capitulation, is anyone listening?

The modern evolution of U.S.-China relations began in 1971 under President Richard Nixon. That year, Dr. Kissinger, his national security adviser, reached an agreement with China to normalize relations between the two countries. Nixon’s visit to Beijing in February 1972 ended a quarter-century of isolation from the West.

By the end of the 1970s, China had begun to reform its socialist economy; in its place, a capitalist phoenix emerged, eager to do business with the US and other rich nations. Chinese citizens soaked up foreign ideas and fashions no longer deemed politically toxic. Many personal freedoms were restored. Some people got rich. Others made a modest living, while urging their children – in most cases, a single child – to aim higher. Opportunities for education exploded after formal schooling had been all but abandoned during Mao’s Cultural Revolution. More than a quarter of a million Chinese are now enrolled in US universities.

Nixon was no idealist. He saw China as a counterweight to the Soviet Union. What China did at home was a lesser concern. “The relationship has always been strategic,” says Jeffrey Bader, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington.

Since Nixon, successive US presidents have adopted the notion that engagement with China – trade, diplomacy, education – would eventually lead to political liberalization, as it had in some other closed regimes. In essence, the more that America knew about China, and China knew about America, the more certain it was that Western norms and practices would prevail.

By most measures, this hasn’t happened. Under Xi, who took power in March 2013, civic space for critical debate has narrowed. Human rights lawyers, Christian activists, and liberal professors have all been targeted and detained as threats to single-party rule. Under Xi, whose term runs to 2023, China’s growing military muscle is being flexed over disputed islands in East Asia. Its economic weight is already felt globally, from Brazil to South Africa to Australia, and that in turn is giving Beijing a greater say in global affairs.

“Chinese power is increasing. Its economic and financial influence is increasing, and it’s winning a lot of deference from the world on that basis,” says Andrew Nathan, a professor of politics at Columbia University in New York.

One example is the $100 billion Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which China launched in June with 56 other countries. The US was not among them. But close allies such as Britain, Germany, and South Korea chose to join, despite US objections to the bank’s lending rules. China says that the AIIB fills a gap in financing for poor countries and isn’t a competitor to the Washington-based World Bank. At the same time, the US is negotiating a trade pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which pointedly excludes China. “If we don’t write the rules, China will write the rules out in that region,” President Obama told The Wall Street Journal in April.

Such political and economic rivalry, combined with China’s military buildup, raises the question of whether China may undermine the US role as guarantor of global security. In the South China Sea, China has built airstrips on disputed islands and reefs. It bristles at US Navy surveillance flights along its coastline. Further north, the Senkaku Islands held by Japan, which China calls Diaoyu and claims as its own, are also being contested.

“It’s not about lumps of rock or coral,” says Hugh White, professor of strategic studies at Australian National University in Canberra. “It’s about who leads in Asia.”

Along China’s rim, countries such as Australia, South Korea, the Philippines, and Japan are military allies of the US. But like all countries in Asia, their largest trading partner is now China. Should Sino-American relations turn overtly adversarial in the future, they would be forced to pick a side. For now, any sign that US allies in Asia are cozying up to China as a hedge against a perceived decline in US strength or willingness to fight could encourage Chinese hawks to push harder – and panic US military strategists. Conversely, an American move to expand its role in the region and arm its allies would spark similar reactions on the other side.

Historians call it the Thucydides Trap: a cycle of conflict that escalates when a rising power disturbs an existing order. In the 5th century BC, Sparta began to see Athens, an upstart city-state bristling with new ideas, as a rival. This led to a protracted and mutually ruinous struggle for military supremacy in ancient Greece. “It was the rise of Athens and the fear this inspired in Sparta that made war inevitable,” wrote Thucydides in his “History of the Peloponnesian War.”

Rudd clicks on a picture of Thucydides during his TED talk (“This guy up here? He’s not Chinese, and he’s not American. He’s Greek.”) He highlights the research of Harvard professor Graham Allison, director of the Belfer Center. Mr. Allison has found that, since 1500, the Thucydides Trap has been sprung 15 times. In 11 cases the result was catastrophic war, including in 1914 when Germany challenged British primacy.

Americans may find it hard to picture China as Athens, the birthplace of democracy. But Chinese policymakers, as keen students of world history, would have little trouble transposing Sparta, a superpower accustomed to dictating terms to others, onto the US. In 2013, Xi told an international delegation, of which Rudd was a member, that China wasn’t seeking to impose its will on the world. “This is not in the DNA of this country given our long cultural and historical background.” Then Xi added, “We all need to work together to avoid the Thucydides Trap.”

There’s a saying: “When elephants fight, the grass suffers.” In ancient times, the grass was unruffled by the rise and fall of distant empires. In our globalized world, a stampede hurts everyone. When Josette Sheeran, president of the Asia Society, attended a summit in Ethiopia, she was seated at dinner with seven African leaders. All told her that their nations’ future depends on constructive US-China relations. “Every region is telling us that the US and China need to work it out,” she says.

“Call me Kevin,” Rudd tells me when we meet in his surprisingly spare office at the Asia Society. In person he’s affable and solicitous, asking if my cup of tea is hot enough. He tells me he made it himself – the actual tea blend. When he was foreign minister, he won a tea-blending competition run by Twinings. Now, a share of profits from all sales of his Australian Afternoon Tea go to his designated charity for animal welfare. I tell him I like the tea. He looks pleased. “I grew up on a farm in rural Australia. The culture of having a cup of tea was a defined culture,” he says.

Rudd speaks in measured, often digressive chunks, with the cadence of a diplomat and the ellipses of a politician adept at swerving past questions. He’s fond of folksy Anglo-Australian metaphors. Referring to political changes in Myanmar (Burma), he speaks of “movement at the station,” a cattle-ranching term. He also lapses into wonky bureaucratese – political “internalities” and “investment instrumentalities.”

China has defined Rudd’s career, for better or worse. Raised in hardscrabble rural Australia, he studied Chinese history and culture and went on to serve as a diplomat, then built a political career that culminated in him being elected Australian prime minister in a landslide victory in 2007. While Rudd’s campaign was grounded in domestic politics, his credentials on China at a time when it was buying up vast amounts of Australian natural resources were clearly a selling point.

His message, says Nicholas Stuart, author of a 2007 biography of Rudd, was that “America is the past. China is the new century. And I can unlock the door for you.”

Three years later, Rudd was out, replaced by his deputy leader, Julia Gillard. His brusque style of leadership had alienated party colleagues and senior bureaucrats alike, and he’d lost public support after flip-flopping on issues such as climate change, which he once called the greatest moral challenge facing the world. At the United Nations climate talks in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 2009, Rudd was overheard using colorful expletives about Chinese negotiators who helped sabotage a binding deal. On this and other issues involving China, Rudd frequently found himself caught between conflicting views and expectations. “He overestimated his position and thought the Chinese would give him a lot more space” on global warming and other issues, says Professor White, who has informally advised Rudd.

He was also hurt by the release of a WikiLeaks cable in which he struck a bellicose tone on China over a private lunch in 2009 with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

Rudd served unhappily as foreign minister under Ms. Gillard. In 2013 he unseated her and briefly served as prime minister again before losing an election. It was a bitter end to his political career. He resigned from Parliament and accepted an offer to teach at Harvard. In September 2014, Rudd spoke with former US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson at an Asia Society panel on China, which led to him being tapped as president of ASPI.

In Australia, many believe that Rudd is eyeing the job of UN secretary-general after Ban Ki-moon’s second term ends next year. The Asia Society, in proximity and prestige, is an ideal launchpad. Rudd denies that he covets the job or that he would stand a chance. The UN’s informal rotation system is against him: Someone from Eastern Europe is due to fill the post next. Still, Frank Brennan, a Jesuit priest and law professor at Australian Catholic University in Canberra who has known Rudd since 1990, says he would be a candidate. “He’s got another big gig in him, whatever it might be.”

Rudd considers himself a realist on Chinese politics. In his Belfer study, he flatly rejects the idea that China’s brand of authoritarian capitalism is bound to fail in the future, despite its current economic travails. It would be “imprudent in the extreme” to assume a “China collapse,” he writes. “This would amount to a triumph of hope over cold, hard analysis.”

Boiled down, Rudd’s argument is that the US and China need to set aside political issues on which their positions are too far apart, such as the status of Taiwan. Instead, they should build mutual trust via joint initiatives on common problems where there is overlap while taking a “constructive” approach to bilateral and multilateral issues, such as reform of the UN and of Pan-Asian forums. Rudd argues that Sino-American cooperation can in time yield the political capital needed for strategic breakthroughs. Curbing the effects of climate change – Mr. Obama and Xi drew up a joint plan of action at a summit in Beijing last November – is an example of common purpose.

Rudd says his report is aimed primarily at policy elites in the US and China, and that any bluntness is intentional. “It’s causing some level of discomfort in both capitals, I assume.... I’m not in the business of dancing around the edges,” he says.

For US readers, Rudd deftly unspools Chinese “realist” thinking on the tenets of American foreign policy, namely that the US has “a dual strategy of undermining China from within, while also containing China from without.” Exhibit A: Obama’s first-term “pivot” to Asia and US arms sales to countries such as India and Vietnam. From China’s perspective, such steps are evidence of preemptive containment.

Similarly, Rudd recognizes the concerns of US strategists who fret that China seeks to create a sphere of influence in Asia that would exclude the US. Rudd notes that Xi is far more decisive and destiny-driven than his predecessors. In May 2014, Xi outlined a regional security concept in which the US wasn’t welcome. “The people of Asia are capable and wise enough to strengthen cooperation among themselves in order to achieve the peace and stability of Asia,” he said.

The US military remains far more capable and better equipped than the Chinese military and is likely to remain so for decades. But perceptions matter. In 2013, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reported the findings of a survey of opinion leaders in China and the US. Majorities in both countries said they viewed the other country as a competitor. Asked if they considered China as an enemy, only 2 percent of US government elites said they did. Among Chinese, 27 percent view the US as an enemy.

Critics say Rudd’s engagement strategy – finding common ground and solving non-core problems – won’t defuse the deeper divisions. Sino-American tensions aren’t simply about a lack of goodwill or diplomatic mechanisms, says Ashley Tellis, a senior associate at Carnegie and coauthor of a report published in April that advocates a hawkish US stance on China. “These are fundamental clashes of interest. There’s nothing in Kevin’s report that tells me how to circumnavigate these clashes.”

Rudd argues that Xi may be open to a “grand strategic bargain” with the US on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Other analysts have proposed that a parallel formula be found for Taiwan, whereby the US stops selling weapons in return for a Chinese pledge not to force reunification. Mr. Bader, who was Obama’s principal adviser on Asia from 2009 to 2011, is skeptical of sweeping quid pro quo deals. “They don’t happen. Every issue is unique and disaggregated and has its own set of bureaucratic actors involved,” he says.

Professor Nathan discounts the likelihood of any great-

power accommodation, too, which he likens to the 1815 Congress of Vienna. “I think there will be a long period of friction over these particular issues. I don’t think they can be settled upfront by some kind of compromise.”

Rudd doesn’t linger on the consequences of the US ceding ground to China in Asia. Yet even a gradual rebalancing would mark a major shift, says White, author of a 2013 book, “The China Choice: Why America Should Share Power.” He says Rudd needs to be frank about what it means to the US to begin to treat China as a peer. “Kevin is trying to say you can do this and it’s not going to hurt. But this is going to hurt.”

Since leaving office, Rudd has kept up his contacts in China. He attends academic gatherings and has been invited to speak at military-run events. While his Belfer study refers to “senior Chinese interlocutors,” Rudd is cagey about whom he meets with. “It’s far better to talk to folks when you can when opportunities arise, in Beijing or Washington, but not to make a song and dance about it,” he tells me.

In 2008, Rudd asserted in a speech in Chinese at Peking University that he was a zhengyou, a sincere friend who would speak frankly to China. But his charm offensive flopped after WikiLeaks revealed that he also spoke frankly to America about China. In 2014, Bob Carr, who succeeded Rudd as Australian foreign minister, wrote in a memoir that his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, had said of Rudd, “You know, in China ... some people love him ... and some people ... hate him!”

In Washington, Rudd has cultivated policymakers on both sides of the aisle, though his personal connections are strongest among Democrats, including foreign-

policy advisers to Mrs. Clinton. In 2009, Obama called Rudd two weeks after the president’s first inauguration. After he was demoted to foreign minister, Rudd continued to meet with Obama’s national security adviser. Rudd is still consulted on China by the Obama administration, says Mr. Nealer, who notes his briefings “appeal to senior policymakers who crave insights without agendas.”

While China may be the reason the White House calls, in his new position at the Asia Society, Rudd has a broad portfolio. One morning in July, I joined a small group at the launch of an ASPI task force chaired by Rudd to promote Indian membership in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation grouping. The next day, he held an hour-long teleconference briefing on Japan. On the third day, I attended a panel on the Iran nuclear deal, which drew a large crowd to the eighth floor of the Asia Society as the evening sun glanced off the platinum-priced apartments of Park Avenue nearby.

Flanked by a former US ambassador and an Iranian-born researcher, Rudd used his introductory remarks to emphasize the historic challenge of nuclear proliferation. He then segued into a self-deprecatory joke about being unable to find his way around New York. As a moderator, Rudd is brisk and sure-footed. Still, just as he did at the earlier event on India, Rudd casually let slip his own bona fides. “I was just talking to the Chinese mission at the UN, just a few days ago,” he said, and added that China takes some pride in its role in the Iranian negotiations.

After Trump and Kim met for more than 40 minutes , they emerged together from the Freedom House -- along with Moon -- and walked side-by-side back to the demarcation line , where Trump and Moon bid Kim farewell .
Back inside Freedom House , Trump declared it a `` great '' and `` legendary '' day and said they agreed to formulate teams to restart active negotiations for a comprehensive agreement . Trump said Steve Biegun , U.S. special representative for North Korea , would lead the U.S. side .
`` We just had a very , very good meeting with Chairman Kim and we ’ ve agreed that we ’ re going to designate a team , and the team will try and work out some deals , and again speed is not the object , we want to see if we can do a really comprehensive good deal . ''
`` Nobody knows how things go , but certainly this was a great day . This was a very legendary , very historic day , '' Trump said .
`` It will be more historic if something comes of it , something very important , but a lot has already come of it , '' Trump continued , pointing to the relationships that have been built through engaging directly with the North Koreans and claimed it was a `` fiery mess '' during the previous administration .
Prior to sitting down for their extended talk , the president said he would be inviting Kim to visit him at the White House .
`` If it was not for the excellent relationship between us , it would not have been possible , '' Kim said during the bilateral .
Trump then spoke and first complimented the strength of Kim 's voice .
`` You hear the power of that voice , nobody 's heard the voice before , he does n't do news conferences , in case you have n't noticed , and this was a special moment , '' Trump said .
`` This is an historic moment , the fact that we 're meeting , '' Trump continued .
The president then thanked Kim for not turning down his invitation to meet at the border , because `` if he did n't show up , the press was going to make us both look bad . ''
`` You made us both look good and I appreciate it , '' Trump said .
`` It was an honor that you asked me to step over that line , and I was proud to step over that line . I thought you might do that , I was n't sure , but I was ready to do it , and I want to thank you , it was great , very historic , '' Trump said .
Trump arrived at the Korean demilitarized zone ( DMZ ) just before 2 a.m. Eastern time in a prelude to a historic meeting with Kim . Trump visited an observation tower , looking into the secluded North , where many U.S. presidents have stopped before .
But unlike previous presidents , Trump later met with Kim at Panmunjeom , the so-called Peace Village , on the border between the two countries and possibly cross over the line and become the first-ever president to visit North Korea .
Trump made brief comments from the overlook : `` After our first summit , all the danger went away , '' Trump claimed . `` I say that for the press , when they say there 's been no difference . There 's been a tremendous difference . ''
He visited U.S. troops at the border afterward , was given the gift of a jacket and signed the wall as has become tradition for presidents .
Just hours before , Trump announced he was set to travel to the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea at a joint press conference with South Korean President Moon Jae-in . Moon joined Trump in his visit to the border .
`` I ’ ll be meeting with Chairman Kim I look forward to it very much . I look forward to seeing him , we ’ ve developed a very good relationship , '' Trump said at the press conference . `` We understand each other . I do believe he understands me and I think I maybe understand him . And sometimes that can lead to very good things . ''
`` I put out the word and he got back , and he wanted to do it from the beginning and so did I , '' Trump continued .
Expanding on his decision Saturday to extend a last-minute invite to Kim to meet him at the DMZ , Trump said the trip was `` something I planned long ago , but had the idea yesterday , to maybe , say 'hello , ' just shake and quickly say 'hello . ' ''
Asked about the possibility of a third summit , Trump said he 'd like to see what happens Sunday before talking about another meeting .
`` Let ’ s see what happens today before we start thinking about that , '' Trump said .
The president also claimed -- falsely -- that former President Barack Obama sought to meet with Kim and that he was rebuffed .
`` The Obama administration was begging for a meeting , there were begging for meetings constantly , and Chairman Kim would not meet him , '' Trump claimed .
The president continued to express optimism about the state of relations with North Korea and insisted that important progress has been made through both of his previous summits with Kim .
`` I 'm not in a rush , '' Trump said . `` If you 're in a rush you get yourself in trouble . ''
On Sunday morning in South Korea , Trump said that Kim `` very much wants to '' meet , and that the two countries are `` trying to work it out . Both want to do it . ''
`` Very short , it would be very short , virtually a handshake , '' Trump said . `` But that ’ s OK. A handshake means a lot . ''
Trump has even raised the possibility of stepping across the border into North Korea -- something no previous U.S. president has done .
`` Sure , I would . I would . I 'd feel very comfortable doing that . I would have no problem , '' Trump said earlier in his Asia trip .
The two leaders have met on two occasions . Their most recent meeting in February in Hanoi , Vietnam , failed to produce an agreement toward the goal of North Koreas ' denuclearization .
Trump announced yesterday that he would be traveling to the DMZ during his visit to South Korea and issued an impromptu Twitter invitation to the North Korean leader to have a brief visit and share a handshake .
After some very important meetings , including my meeting with President Xi of China , I will be leaving Japan for South Korea ( with President Moon ) . While there , if Chairman Kim of North Korea sees this , I would meet him at the Border/DMZ just to shake his hand and say Hello ( ? ) ! — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) June 28 , 2019
Since that time , a senior administration official said that the governments of the United States , North Korea and South Korea have been in communication to prepare for the prospective meeting .
In remarks Sunday morning at a breakfast with Korean business leaders , President Trump suggested that a meeting was likely to happen .
`` I understand they want to meet and I ’ d love to say hello , '' Trump said .
Trump is also expected to meet with U.S. service members following his brief meeting with Kim .
Asked by ███ ’ Jonathan Karl in a press conference Saturday if it will be a bad sign if the North Korean leader doesn ’ t take him up on his offer to meet , the president said it would not .
`` No , '' Trump told Karl . `` Of course , I thought of that because I know if he didn ’ t , everybody is going to say , ‘ Oh , he was stood up by Chairman Kim. ’ No , I understood that . ''
The president went on to say that the North Korean leader must follow him on Twitter , because U.S. officials `` got a call very quickly '' after he sent out his tweet .
The president said if the meeting does happen , it would only be a brief one .
`` We 'll see each other for two minutes , '' Trump said . `` That will be fine .

The president then thanked Kim for not turning down his invitation to meet at the border, because ""if he didn't show up, the press was going to make us both look bad.""

""You made us both look good and I appreciate it,"" Trump said.

""It was an honor that you asked me to step over that line, and I was proud to step over that line. I thought you might do that, I wasn't sure, but I was ready to do it, and I want to thank you, it was great, very historic,"" Trump said.

Trump arrived at the Korean demilitarized zone (DMZ) just before 2 a.m. Eastern time in a prelude to a historic meeting with Kim. Trump visited an observation tower, looking into the secluded North, where many U.S. presidents have stopped before.

But unlike previous presidents, Trump later met with Kim at Panmunjeom, the so-called Peace Village, on the border between the two countries and possibly cross over the line and become the first-ever president to visit North Korea.

Trump made brief comments from the overlook: ""After our first summit, all the danger went away,"" Trump claimed. ""I say that for the press, when they say there's been no difference. There's been a tremendous difference.""

He visited U.S. troops at the border afterward, was given the gift of a jacket and signed the wall as has become tradition for presidents.

Just hours before, Trump announced he was set to travel to the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea at a joint press conference with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Moon joined Trump in his visit to the border.

""I’ll be meeting with Chairman Kim I look forward to it very much. I look forward to seeing him, we’ve developed a very good relationship,"" Trump said at the press conference. ""We understand each other. I do believe he understands me and I think I maybe understand him. And sometimes that can lead to very good things.""

""I put out the word and he got back, and he wanted to do it from the beginning and so did I,"" Trump continued.

Expanding on his decision Saturday to extend a last-minute invite to Kim to meet him at the DMZ, Trump said the trip was ""something I planned long ago, but had the idea yesterday, to maybe, say 'hello,' just shake and quickly say 'hello.'""

Asked about the possibility of a third summit, Trump said he'd like to see what happens Sunday before talking about another meeting.

""Let’s see what happens today before we start thinking about that,"" Trump said.

The president also claimed -- falsely -- that former President Barack Obama sought to meet with Kim and that he was rebuffed.

""The Obama administration was begging for a meeting, there were begging for meetings constantly, and Chairman Kim would not meet him,"" Trump claimed.

The president continued to express optimism about the state of relations with North Korea and insisted that important progress has been made through both of his previous summits with Kim.

""I'm not in a rush,"" Trump said. ""If you're in a rush you get yourself in trouble.""

On Sunday morning in South Korea, Trump said that Kim ""very much wants to"" meet, and that the two countries are ""trying to work it out. Both want to do it.""

""Very short, it would be very short, virtually a handshake,"" Trump said. ""But that’s OK. A handshake means a lot.""

Trump has even raised the possibility of stepping across the border into North Korea -- something no previous U.S. president has done.

""Sure, I would. I would. I'd feel very comfortable doing that. I would have no problem,"" Trump said earlier in his Asia trip.

The two leaders have met on two occasions. Their most recent meeting in February in Hanoi, Vietnam, failed to produce an agreement toward the goal of North Koreas' denuclearization.

Trump announced yesterday that he would be traveling to the DMZ during his visit to South Korea and issued an impromptu Twitter invitation to the North Korean leader to have a brief visit and share a handshake.

After some very important meetings, including my meeting with President Xi of China, I will be leaving Japan for South Korea (with President Moon). While there, if Chairman Kim of North Korea sees this, I would meet him at the Border/DMZ just to shake his hand and say Hello(?)! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 28, 2019

Since that time, a senior administration official said that the governments of the United States, North Korea and South Korea have been in communication to prepare for the prospective meeting.

In remarks Sunday morning at a breakfast with Korean business leaders, President Trump suggested that a meeting was likely to happen.

""I understand they want to meet and I’d love to say hello,"" Trump said.

Trump is also expected to meet with U.S. service members following his brief meeting with Kim.

Asked by ABC News’ Jonathan Karl in a press conference Saturday if it will be a bad sign if the North Korean leader doesn’t take him up on his offer to meet, the president said it would not.

""No,"" Trump told Karl. ""Of course, I thought of that because I know if he didn’t, everybody is going to say, ‘Oh, he was stood up by Chairman Kim.’ No, I understood that.""

The president went on to say that the North Korean leader must follow him on Twitter, because U.S. officials ""got a call very quickly"" after he sent out his tweet.

The president said if the meeting does happen, it would only be a brief one.

""We'll see each other for two minutes,"" Trump said. ""That will be fine.""",www.abcnews.go.com,left,lUYkcjMSZHE791kJ

Listening to the Democrats and their wholly owned media subsidiary , you would have thought that Trump had ( a ) smilingly handed Putin a large red “ reset ” button or ( b ) had been caught on a hot mic during a global nuclear security summit murmuring to Putin ’ s representative that , after the midterm elections , he would have more flexibility in his dealings with Russia or ( c ) had signed off on a deal to give the Russians control of 20 % of America ’ s uranium reserves in return for a $ 140,000,000 donation by Russian interests to his family ’ s foundation and a $ 500,000 fee paid to Melania for giving a speech in Moscow or ( d ) endangered national security by transmitting classified government documents over an unsecure private email server or ( e ) paid Russians for salacious , unverified slime to discredit Hillary Clinton or ( f ) during a presidential debate casually dismissed the Russian threat by joking that “ The 1980s called ; they want their foreign policy back . ”
Of course , he did none of the above . So , what did Trump do that for the thousandth time has summoned the furies of Le Résistance de la Gauche ?
He — gasp — declined to publicly scold and insult Putin to his face and questioned the probity of our intelligence community , i.e. , the deep state cabal who have been trying for the past three years to frame him for colluding with the Russians . In doing so , he pointed out the obvious fact that these ongoing efforts to destroy him have complicated and impeded his ability to conduct foreign policy especially in regard to this nation ’ s fraught relations with Russia , the world ’ s second largest nuclear power .
He was even so unpatriotic as to question the basis for Special Counsel Robert Mueller ’ s latest pretend indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers which — to put it kindly — appears to be the product of questionable investigative work . Most tellingly , he asked how Team Mueller had determined that the Russians had hacked the Democratic National Committee ’ s computer when the DNC has forbidden law enforcement access to its server . This is a not inconsiderable question . ( See “ Mr . Mueller : Was the DNC Server Actually Hacked by the Russians ? ” in The ███ , March 29 , 2018 . )
So , has Trump sold out to the Russians ? To anyone but the deranged left , his prior actions conclusively demonstrate that he has not . In August 2017 , he approved sanctions against Russia for its meddling in the 2016 election , human rights violations , annexation of Crimea and military operations against Ukraine . In marked contrast to Barack Obama who had refused to sell arms to Ukraine , President Trump backed up these sanctions by authorizing weapons sales to the Ukrainians as well as the Republic of Georgia to aid their struggle against Russian aggression .
In March 2018 , Trump ordered the expulsion of 60 Russians from the U.S. in response to allegations that Russian operatives had poisoned a former Russian spy in Great Britain . Twelve of these individuals were identified as Russian intelligence officers who worked out of the United Nations in New York . Trump also closed the Russian consulate in Seattle .
In April 2018 , Trump imposed further sanctions on more than two dozen Russian oligarchs , 12 companies that they control , 17 senior government officials , and a state-owned arms dealer . The sanctions consisted of freezing all assets under U.S. jurisdiction belonging to these targets and forbidding U.S. citizens from transacting business with them .
“ The Russian government operates for the disproportionate benefit of oligarchs and government elites , ” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in the statement announcing the sanctions . “ The Russian government engages in a range of malign activity around the globe , including continuing to occupy Crimea and instigate violence in eastern Ukraine , supplying the Assad regime with material and weaponry as they bomb their own civilians , attempting to subvert Western democracies , and malicious cyber activities . Russian oligarchs and elites who profit from this corrupt system will no longer be insulated from the consequences of their government ’ s destabilizing activities . ”
In April 2018 , Trump tweeted a warning to Russia that it should “ get ready ” for missiles to be fired at Syria . He added that Russia should not “ be partners with a Gas Killing Animal , ” i.e . Syrian President Assad . And then the United States fired missiles that killed an estimated 200 Russian “ mercenaries ” fighting for the Assad government .
Finally , in the lead up to the Helsinki meeting , Trump chastised Germany for entering into a self-defeating gas pipeline deal whereby it would make itself energy dependent on Russia while the United States simultaneously funded NATO to protect Germany from Russian aggression .
It was against this record of concrete and consistent action against Russian interests that Trump met with Putin and sought to turn the page on the last 20 years of increasingly bitter and deteriorating relations with Russia .

foreign_policy,Guest Writer - Right,2,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/29/lessons-from-obamas-deal-with-iran.html,OPINION: Lessons from Obama's deal with Iran,2015-07-29,Marco Rubio,"In April , President Obama announced the framework of a deal that he said would prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon .
“ We only have three options for addressing Iran ’ s nuclear program ” -- cutting a deal with Iran , “ starting another war in the Middle East ” or “ hope for the best . ”
In deploying his favorite rhetorical device , the president reaffirmed to the world he only really saw one option : cutting a deal with Iran no matter the cost .
If after witnessing six years of President Obama ’ s weak and feckless foreign policy wasn ’ t enough to embolden the regime in Tehran , President Obama ’ s comments in April must have convinced the mullahs they had the American president right where they wanted him .
The price for President Obama ’ s penchant for negotiating from weakness is now clear . The deal announced with much fanfare by the White House two weeks ago comes nowhere close to the deal President Obama promised the American people he ’ d get .

“We only have three options for addressing Iran’s nuclear program” -- cutting a deal with Iran, “starting another war in the Middle East” or “hope for the best.”

In deploying his favorite rhetorical device, the president reaffirmed to the world he only really saw one option: cutting a deal with Iran no matter the cost.

If after witnessing six years of President Obama’s weak and feckless foreign policy wasn’t enough to embolden the regime in Tehran, President Obama’s comments in April must have convinced the mullahs they had the American president right where they wanted him.

The price for President Obama’s penchant for negotiating from weakness is now clear. The deal announced with much fanfare by the White House two weeks ago comes nowhere close to the deal President Obama promised the American people he’d get.

Accompanying President Donald Trump on his first trip abroad as commander in chief — and hours after the administration announced some $ 109 billion in arms sales to Saudi Arabia and $ 350 billion in direct U.S. investment over 10 years by the Muslim-majority country — Tillerson referenced multiple potential threats facing the two countries .
“ We have to defeat ISIS on the battlefield , but we really have to defeat ISIS in the cyberspace , ” he said , referencing the development of a new center for combating extremist ideology , to be based in Riyadh .

India had , for months , been trying to convince the world that West Pakistan ’ s subjugation of East Pakistan was an emergency . Refugees from East Pakistan were pouring into India , and the situation would only be improved with a resolution of the political predicament between West and East Pakistan .
The Soviet Union was the only country that listened . In August of that year , Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi signed the India-Soviet Treaty of Peace , Friendship and Cooperation . Gandhi had held off on completing the agreement for domestic political reasons ; she had not wanted to give fodder to those political opponents who accused her of being too cozy with the Soviet Union . But international concerns were soon more pressing : With the signing of the treaty , the Soviet Union provided India both the diplomatic and arms support it needed for the war Gandhi knew was coming , helping India over Pakistan .
While the world in 2020 is in many ways changed from that time , 1971 looms large in the India-Russia relationship today . Moscow was a reliable partner for New Delhi when no one else was . And the United States , meanwhile , actively ignored India ’ s pleas to deal with the situation in East Pakistan : President Richard Nixon and National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger considered Pakistan a key go-between in opening relations with China .
Even today , in 2020 , it is Moscow that organized a trilateral meeting among the foreign ministers of Russia , India , and China on June 23 , bringing New Delhi and Beijing together following deadly clashes between their countries ’ armed forces in the Galwan Valley in the disputed territory of Ladakh . Once again , amid an increasingly tense international problem , Moscow has stepped in . And what ’ s more , Russia assured India that , on New Delhi ’ s request , it would deliver new defense equipment in two to three months .
While the world in 2020 is in many ways changed from that time , 1971 looms large in the India-Russia relationship today .
There are some who see Moscow ’ s importance as little more than a fond memory . While the Indian government maintains that it must have good relations with both the United States and Russia , there are others in India today who insist its future is solely , or at least primarily , with the United States .
The “ best ” and “ most substantive ” relationship that India has is with the United States , said C. Raja Mohan , the director of the Institute of South Asian Studies at the National University of Singapore . India “ is not going to sacrifice that to say , ‘ I was once married to the Russians. ’ ” Certainly , that U.S. President Donald Trump ’ s secretaries of state , Rex Tillerson and Mike Pompeo , both gave major speeches about India and the Indo-Pacific early on in their tenures suggests that India is important to the United States ; that Trump went to India in February of this year on a visit that was heavy on ceremony ( if light on substance ) suggests the same .
But being friendly with Washington does not mean New Delhi can ’ t maintain important ties with Moscow . The world has changed , but India and Russia have found ways for their relationship to hold firm , standing steady for each other at times when the rest of the world wouldn ’ t , maintaining largely consistent foreign policies despite changing leaderships , and refusing to bury a historic partnership .
“ The Russians , ” said the New Delhi-based defense journalist Saurabh Joshi , “ are in the best position they ’ ve been in in this town since the fall of the Soviet Union . ”
The India-Russia relationship did not begin in 1971 . Moscow and Delhi had been strengthening ties , with some interruptions and hiccups , over the course of the 1950s and 1960s . The Soviet Union provided development assistance in the post-Stalin 1950s and military assistance in the 1960s , said Anuradha Chenoy , a Russia expert and former dean of the School of International Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University . That Nehru , India ’ s first prime minister , envisioned his country as noncapitalist and at least partially socialist helped too , she said .
But the former Indian diplomat Ronen Sen , who served twice in the Soviet Union between 1968 and 1985 and was the ambassador to the Russian Federation from 1992 to 1998 , said that the country with which India had a common ideology—or was expected to have shared values and views that go along with it—was the United States . “ The expectations , ” he said , “ were higher on both sides. ” That , by extension , meant that the frustrations when those expectations were not met were more deeply felt , too .
The Soviet Union , meanwhile , was exceeding expectations it was never meant to meet . When India conducted its first nuclear tests in the 1970s , it created tensions with the United States ; while Washington disapproved of New Delhi ’ s attempt to acquire nuclear weapons , Indian diplomats resented their American counterparts ’ lecturing . The Soviet Union , by comparison , publicly stressed the tests ’ peaceful nature , though historical records show the Soviets privately tried to persuade India not to go ahead with them .
The Soviet Union did not just provide tacit support for , or at least less vocal disapproval of , India ’ s nuclear program . It also helped build out India ’ s defense force . Historians describe India as having been “ addicted ” to Soviet defense machinery in the 1970s and 1980s . And the addiction came at little cost : Soviet machinery was often bought on credit .
India mattered quite a lot to the Soviet Union , which considered it more consistently than the United States did .
There was also the reality that India mattered quite a lot to the Soviet Union , which considered it more consistently than the United States did . While there might have been moments where the United States decided to pay attention to India , they were sporadic and need-based ; the Soviet Union ’ s focus was sustained . That not one but two chapters of the second volume of The Mitrokhin Archive , a look at the KGB files and plans from Soviet times , is dedicated to India suggests just how important Delhi was to Moscow . Famously , the conspiracy theory that the CIA created the HIV/AIDS epidemic was planted by Moscow in an Indian newspaper .
There was also the added bonus that India and the Soviet Union did not impose their morals on one another . India , which was quick to point out the evils and ills of Western imperialism , held its tongue when the Soviet Union quashed the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and again when it invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968 . But the Soviet Union more than repaid India for its relative quiet . It backed India on Kashmir , the status of which India and Pakistan have disputed since their independence in 1947 .
“ Since the 1950s , the Russian position on Kashmir has been the key driving force , ” said Phunchok Stobdan , a former Indian ambassador to Kyrgyzstan . When China or , until more recently , the United States might have censured India over Kashmir at the United Nations , the Soviet Union ( and now Russia ) could use its veto to protect India . And it did . In 1957 , 1962 , and 1971 , the Soviet Union was the only country to veto resolutions seeking U.N. intervention over Kashmir ; in the summer of 2019 , when India revoked Kashmir ’ s special status and plunged the state into lockdown and an information blackout , Russia was the first to describe it as an internal matter .
In the 1990s , the story goes , times changed . The Soviet Union dissolved , and the Russian Federation was more interested , at least for most of a decade , with looking west than with developing its special relationship with India . And India , which was undertaking major fiscal reforms and opening up its economy , was looking to the United States again , too .
But there are a few ways in which this story—of a lost decade between India and Russia—is incomplete . The reality is that India , which used Russian arms and weaponry for its Army , Navy , and Air Force , needed the Russian defense industry—and essentially kept it afloat during Russia ’ s chaotic transition . And though people-to-people contacts and cultural connections were not what they were in the Soviet years , there were some families and businesses—for example , the Khemka family of the SUN Group—that managed to do business in Russia and with Russians , and that are still working in Russia today . Indian pharmaceuticals , for example , found a sizable market in Russia : In 2000 , India was the second-largest exporter of drugs to Russia behind Germany . Overall , however , it is fair to say the trade relationship between the two countries declined . While Russia ranked as the top destination for Indian exports in 1990 , by 2015 , it was not even among the top 30 countries India exported to .
There was , of course , another reality that could not be discounted , which was that in 1998 India conducted a second round of nuclear tests . That year , after the tests , relations between India and the United States cooled yet again . Russia , by comparison , accepted which way the wind was blowing and , with it , the idea of a nuclear India .
It was Russian President Vladimir Putin who , by all accounts , made clear to Delhi that the road to India being accepted as a nuclear power ran through Washington . And , in 2006 , U.S. President George W. Bush and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh did indeed complete a civil nuclear deal , a major milestone in U.S.-Indian relations .
But the real beneficiary of that deal , said Asoke Mukerji , a former permanent representative of India to the United Nations , was Russia : Moscow , and not Washington , has worked with New Delhi on the construction of nuclear reactors and has plans to build more .
Critically , Russia leases India its only nuclear attack submarine . According to the defense journalist and former Indian Army colonel Ajai Shukla , as long as Russia is the only country willing to do so—and is the only one willing to provide India crucial technologies that go into building its own line of nuclear missile submarines—the India-Russia relationship will continue .
The same is true for the defense relationship more broadly . While India under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has diversified the sources of its arms and defense procurements—such as a recent $ 3 billion deal with the United States following Trump ’ s visit in February—it still counts on Russia for a reported 60 percent of its supplies . And India is still buying from Russia for the future . In 2018 , Putin and Modi appeared to careful observers to recommit to the relationship with an informal summit in the Russian city of Sochi . Both because it wanted a missile defense system and to make a point to the United States , India approved a purchase of Russia ’ s S-400 missile defense system that year , blocking off the opportunity to buy other equipment from the United States because , as the White House put it , “ the [ American ] F-35 can not coexist with a Russian intelligence collection platform that will be used to learn about its advanced capabilities. ” That was a risk . New Delhi decided it was a risk worth taking .
Russia , one is told time and again in India , is a dependable partner . It will not pursue policy that will drag India into conflict . It will not , say , kill an Iranian general without bothering to so much as pick up the phone to let New Delhi know . ( That it , say , annexed Crimea is of less concern to New Delhi , which did not issue a statement against the move back in 2014 . ) It will not change its ███ with each new president , because it will not have new presidents , and Russia will hold its tongue when it comes to what India regards as its internal affairs .
The same can not be said for the United States . Even with Trump at the helm , many in the United States advance criticisms on human rights in India . Rep. Ilhan Omar , a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives , has been critical of India ’ s actions in and on Kashmir . Rep. Pramila Jayapal has been , too—as a result , S. Jaishankar , India ’ s external affairs minister , refused to meet with Jayapal and the House Foreign Affairs Committee , saying he had “ no interest in meeting her. ” And despite Modi and Trump ’ s professed affinity for each other , some Republicans , including Sens . Lindsey Graham and Todd Young , have criticized what they see as human rights violations in Modi ’ s India .
Russia , by comparison , has no prominent politician ( save , perhaps , Chechnya ’ s mini-dictator Ramzan Kadyrov ) who would criticize India . Russia will call Kashmir and the treatment of Muslims in India internal matters ; it will defend India at the U.N. Security Council . And so the relationship will endure .
And there are , if not large trade numbers , then particular industries such as energy in which India and Russia can work together . And perhaps the sector most emblematic of the India-Russia relationship is the diamond trade , a unique situation and opportunity—diamond mining in the far east—where only Russians and Indians can help one another . The diamonds are in the Russian far east ; the people who know how to polish them are in India . ( Ninety percent of the world ’ s diamonds pass through India—and specifically through Modi ’ s home state of Gujarat—for exactly that reason . )
Further , and most importantly , while the trade partnership continues to not be what either side would want , you can ’ t measure Russia ’ s importance in terms of the business value . “ When they say Russia is not so important , they are not looking at a world map , ” said P.S . Raghavan , another former Indian ambassador to Russia .
“ Geography dictates good relations , ” he said . “ America is a distant power. ” And one could add that the United States , despite its ongoing military cooperation with Australia , India , and Japan as part of the so-called Quad , is an ally whose security umbrella may get diverted by other preoccupations .
Neither India—nor Russia , for that matter—wants to be a junior partner to China or the United States . And one way that they can try to avoid that outcome is to remind China and the United States , and the rest of the world , that they can turn back to and bolster each other . India , following recent tensions with China , may want to turn more fully to the United States . But if past is prologue and the present is any indication , it will not give up on its ties with Russia .
The year is not 1971 . The relationship may not be as robust as it once was or as all-consuming as it once was—and , certainly , defense expenditures and even cultural ties between the two are not what they were .
But the rest of the world is not in 1971 , either . There ’ s the United States under Trump and an increasingly aggressive China . And neither India nor Russia needs it to be 1971 to remain to each other now what they were then : of consistently unique use .","In December 1971, India and Pakistan fought for 13 days—one of the shortest wars in history—over the humanitarian crisis in East Pakistan, now Bangladesh. India had, for months, been trying to convince the world that West Pakistan’s subjugation of East Pakistan was an emergency. Refugees from East Pakistan were pouring into India, and the situation would only be improved with a resolution of the political predicament between West and East Pakistan.

The Soviet Union was the only country that listened. In August of that year, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi signed the India-Soviet Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Cooperation. Gandhi had held off on completing the agreement for domestic political reasons; she had not wanted to give fodder to those political opponents who accused her of being too cozy with the Soviet Union. But international concerns were soon more pressing: With the signing of the treaty, the Soviet Union provided India both the diplomatic and arms support it needed for the war Gandhi knew was coming, helping India over Pakistan.

While the world in 2020 is in many ways changed from that time, 1971 looms large in the India-Russia relationship today. Moscow was a reliable partner for New Delhi when no one else was. And the United States, meanwhile, actively ignored India’s pleas to deal with the situation in East Pakistan: President Richard Nixon and National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger considered Pakistan a key go-between in opening relations with China.







Even today, in 2020, it is Moscow that organized a trilateral meeting among the foreign ministers of Russia, India, and China on June 23, bringing New Delhi and Beijing together following deadly clashes between their countries’ armed forces in the Galwan Valley in the disputed territory of Ladakh. Once again, amid an increasingly tense international problem, Moscow has stepped in. And what’s more, Russia assured India that, on New Delhi’s request, it would deliver new defense equipment in two to three months.

While the world in 2020 is in many ways changed from that time, 1971 looms large in the India-Russia relationship today.

There are some who see Moscow’s importance as little more than a fond memory. While the Indian government maintains that it must have good relations with both the United States and Russia, there are others in India today who insist its future is solely, or at least primarily, with the United States.

The “best” and “most substantive” relationship that India has is with the United States, said C. Raja Mohan, the director of the Institute of South Asian Studies at the National University of Singapore. India “is not going to sacrifice that to say, ‘I was once married to the Russians.’” Certainly, that U.S. President Donald Trump’s secretaries of state, Rex Tillerson and Mike Pompeo, both gave major speeches about India and the Indo-Pacific early on in their tenures suggests that India is important to the United States; that Trump went to India in February of this year on a visit that was heavy on ceremony (if light on substance) suggests the same.

But being friendly with Washington does not mean New Delhi can’t maintain important ties with Moscow. The world has changed, but India and Russia have found ways for their relationship to hold firm, standing steady for each other at times when the rest of the world wouldn’t, maintaining largely consistent foreign policies despite changing leaderships, and refusing to bury a historic partnership.

“The Russians,” said the New Delhi-based defense journalist Saurabh Joshi, “are in the best position they’ve been in in this town since the fall of the Soviet Union.”

The India-Russia relationship did not begin in 1971. Moscow and Delhi had been strengthening ties, with some interruptions and hiccups, over the course of the 1950s and 1960s. The Soviet Union provided development assistance in the post-Stalin 1950s and military assistance in the 1960s, said Anuradha Chenoy, a Russia expert and former dean of the School of International Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University.

The Soviet Union did not just provide tacit support for, or at least less vocal disapproval of, India’s nuclear program. It also helped build out India’s defense force. Historians describe India as having been “addicted” to Soviet defense machinery in the 1970s and 1980s. And the addiction came at little cost: Soviet machinery was often bought on credit.

foreign_policy,BBC News,1,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48814975,US-North Korea: Trump and Kim agree to restart talks in historic meeting,,,"Donald Trump has become the first sitting US president to set foot in North Korea , after meeting Kim Jong-un in the area dividing the two Koreas .
Mr Trump and the North Korean leader posed for handshakes before talking for nearly an hour in the heavily fortified demilitarised zone ( DMZ ) .
Both countries agreed to set up teams to resume stalled nuclear talks .
Their last summit broke down in February with no progress on denuclearisation in North Korea .
Critics have dismissed the occasion - the two leaders ' third face-to-face encounter in just over a year - as a political theatre and say North Korea still needs to show that it is serious in getting rid of its nuclear weapons .
In a meeting apparently arranged after Mr Trump invited Mr Kim on Twitter on Saturday , they shook hands across the demarcation line between the Koreas before Mr Trump briefly crossed into North Korea , a symbolic milestone .
`` Good to see you again . I never expected to meet you at this place , '' a smiley Mr Kim told Mr Trump through an interpreter in an encounter broadcast live on international television .
Looking relaxed , Mr Kim crossed into South Korea and alongside Mr Trump said : `` I believe this is an expression of his willingness to eliminate all the unfortunate past and open a new future . ''
The encounter had initially been billed as a short greeting but Mr Trump and Mr Kim ended up talking for almost an hour in a building known as the Freedom House , on the South Korean side .
For a brief moment , Mr Trump and Mr Kim were joined by South Korea 's President Moon Jae-in , an unprecedented three-way gathering .
Speaking next to Mr Trump in a rare statement to the press , Mr Kim said the meeting was a symbol of their `` excellent '' relationship .
Calling their friendship `` particularly great '' , Mr Trump - who once referred to Mr Kim as `` little rocket man '' - said it was a `` great day for the world '' and that he was `` proud to step over the line '' between the Koreas .
North Korean media have yet to mention the talks - including in the 20:00 ( 11:00 GMT ) Korean Central TV bulletin - although typically they wait until the next day to report on the news .
A number have been to the armistice line that has divided the peninsula since the Korean War ended in 1953 , largely to show support for the South .
Both Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton have been to North Korea , flying into the capital , Pyongyang , but only after they left office .
Barack Obama wore a bomber jacket and binoculars for his visit to the armistice line . Mr Trump changed the optics , opting for a business suit .
Donald Trump once told his West Wing staff to treat each day in the White House like an episode of reality TV , but he prefers to choreograph his own presidency . The meeting with Mr Kim was classic Trumpian stage management , a diplomatic production that began with an impromptu tweet early morning at the G20 that led to a meeting that ordinarily would have taken months to organise .
The setting in the demilitarised zone could hardly have been loaded with more meaning , and Mr Trump was more than happy to perform one of the most memorable `` made-for-television '' moments of his presidency , stepping over the 38th parallel into what has long been enemy territory , a threshold no sitting US president has never crossed .
The images were mesmerising , but to what end ? Donald Trump 's unorthodox diplomacy has certainly reduced tensions on the Korean peninsula , but it has not stopped North Korea from continuing to expand its nuclear arsenal .
This relationship has produced smiles and handshakes but not the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula . Donald Trump 's visit to North Korea lasted just over a minute - more than enough time , his critics will say , to legitimise a totalitarian regime with one of the worst human rights records on the planet .
Negotiators from the two countries will meet in the next weeks to resume discussions about North Korea 's nuclear programme , Mr Trump told reporters , saying he was `` not looking for speed [ but ] looking to get it right . ''
Sanctions on North Korea , he added , would remain in place though he appeared to leave open the possibility of easing them as part of the talks . Mr Trump also said he had invited Mr Kim to visit Washington .
But analysts have questioned whether the meeting will result in any substantive progress .
`` This whole meme is just another Trump snow-job of flim-flam . Does anyone seriously believe Kim will give up even one warhead [ because ] Trump is his bud ? , '' said Robert Kelly , professor of political science at Pusan University in South Korea .
Sue Mi Terry , who served as a US National Security Council aide specializing in Korean affairs , said the meeting could result in progress if Mr Trump shows he is willing to accept a partial accord rather than a comprehensive deal .
`` I do think Kim could offer just enough on the negotiating table such as the Yongbyon nuclear facility plus yet another suspected nuclear facility in order to secure an interim deal with Trump and at least some sanctions relief , '' she told the New York Times .
But Pope Francis has praised the meeting , saying it was a `` good example of the culture of encounter '' .
Negotiations with North Korea to try to convince it to abandon its controversial nuclear programme reached a peak last year when Mr Trump and Mr Kim had a historic meeting in Singapore .
They both committed to the `` complete denuclearisation '' of the Korean peninsula , but without clarifying what that meant .
It was hoped their second meeting , in Hanoi in February , would make some concrete agreement about North Korea handing over its nuclear programme in exchange for some of the tight sanctions against it being lifted .

Donald Trump has become the first sitting US president to set foot in North Korea, after meeting Kim Jong-un in the area dividing the two Koreas.

Mr Trump and the North Korean leader posed for handshakes before talking for nearly an hour in the heavily fortified demilitarised zone (DMZ).

Both countries agreed to set up teams to resume stalled nuclear talks.

Their last summit broke down in February with no progress on denuclearisation in North Korea.

Critics have dismissed the occasion - the two leaders' third face-to-face encounter in just over a year - as a political theatre and say North Korea still needs to show that it is serious in getting rid of its nuclear weapons.

What happened at the DMZ?

In a meeting apparently arranged after Mr Trump invited Mr Kim on Twitter on Saturday, they shook hands across the demarcation line between the Koreas before Mr Trump briefly crossed into North Korea, a symbolic milestone.

""Good to see you again. I never expected to meet you at this place,"" a smiley Mr Kim told Mr Trump through an interpreter in an encounter broadcast live on international television.

""Big moment,"" Mr Trump said, ""tremendous progress.""

Looking relaxed, Mr Kim crossed into South Korea and alongside Mr Trump said: ""I believe this is an expression of his willingness to eliminate all the unfortunate past and open a new future.""

The encounter had initially been billed as a short greeting but Mr Trump and Mr Kim ended up talking for almost an hour in a building known as the Freedom House, on the South Korean side.

For a brief moment, Mr Trump and Mr Kim were joined by South Korea's President Moon Jae-in, an unprecedented three-way gathering.

Speaking next to Mr Trump in a rare statement to the press, Mr Kim said the meeting was a symbol of their ""excellent"" relationship.

Calling their friendship ""particularly great"", Mr Trump - who once referred to Mr Kim as ""little rocket man"" - said it was a ""great day for the world"" and that he was ""proud to step over the line"" between the Koreas.

North Korean media have yet to mention the talks - including in the 20:00 (11:00 GMT) Korean Central TV bulletin - although typically they wait until the next day to report on the news.

Have other US presidents visited?

A number have been to the armistice line that has divided the peninsula since the Korean War ended in 1953, largely to show support for the South.

Both Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton have been to North Korea, flying into the capital, Pyongyang, but only after they left office.

Barack Obama wore a bomber jacket and binoculars for his visit to the armistice line. Mr Trump changed the optics, opting for a business suit.

A made-for-TV moment, but to what end?

Donald Trump once told his West Wing staff to treat each day in the White House like an episode of reality TV, but he prefers to choreograph his own presidency. The meeting with Mr Kim was classic Trumpian stage management, a diplomatic production that began with an impromptu tweet early morning at the G20 that led to a meeting that ordinarily would have taken months to organise.

The setting in the demilitarised zone could hardly have been loaded with more meaning, and Mr Trump was more than happy to perform one of the most memorable ""made-for-television"" moments of his presidency, stepping over the 38th parallel into what has long been enemy territory, a threshold no sitting US president has never crossed.

The images were mesmerising, but to what end? Donald Trump's unorthodox diplomacy has certainly reduced tensions on the Korean peninsula, but it has not stopped North Korea from continuing to expand its nuclear arsenal.

This relationship has produced smiles and handshakes but not the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. Donald Trump's visit to North Korea lasted just over a minute - more than enough time, his critics will say, to legitimise a totalitarian regime with one of the worst human rights records on the planet.

What to make of the meeting?

Negotiators from the two countries will meet in the next weeks to resume discussions about North Korea's nuclear programme, Mr Trump told reporters, saying he was ""not looking for speed [but] looking to get it right.""

Sanctions on North Korea, he added, would remain in place though he appeared to leave open the possibility of easing them as part of the talks. Mr Trump also said he had invited Mr Kim to visit Washington.

But analysts have questioned whether the meeting will result in any substantive progress.

""This whole meme is just another Trump snow-job of flim-flam. Does anyone seriously believe Kim will give up even one warhead [because] Trump is his bud?,"" said Robert Kelly, professor of political science at Pusan University in South Korea.

Sue Mi Terry, who served as a US National Security Council aide specializing in Korean affairs, said the meeting could result in progress if Mr Trump shows he is willing to accept a partial accord rather than a comprehensive deal.

""I do think Kim could offer just enough on the negotiating table such as the Yongbyon nuclear facility plus yet another suspected nuclear facility in order to secure an interim deal with Trump and at least some sanctions relief,"" she told the New York Times.

But Pope Francis has praised the meeting, saying it was a ""good example of the culture of encounter"".

How are US-North Korea relations?

Negotiations with North Korea to try to convince it to abandon its controversial nuclear programme reached a peak last year when Mr Trump and Mr Kim had a historic meeting in Singapore.

They both committed to the ""complete denuclearisation"" of the Korean peninsula, but without clarifying what that meant.

It was hoped their second meeting, in Hanoi in February, would make some concrete agreement about North Korea handing over its nuclear programme in exchange for some of the tight sanctions against it being lifted.

But those talks ended with no deal, as they failed to agree on the pace at which sanctions should be eased. Since then the negotiations have stalled, though Mr Kim and Mr Trump have exchanged letters recently.",www.bbc.com,center,p5BCv6fFeETNvJPY

What the Graham-Van Hollen bill would do to Turkey

The two-page proposal, which you can find below or here, is broken up into eight sections of punishments but it really targets three main entities.

First, it goes after Turkey’s top political leaders, from the president to the minister of energy and natural resources. Basically, if you’re a key member of Erdoğan’s staff, you’re getting sanctioned.

Second, a lot of the penalties target Turkey’s military, which is a bold move considering the country is a NATO ally. Countries that sell weapons to Turkey or offer any assistance will face US sanctions, per the bill, and that could make it harder for Ankara to rearm.

Third, Turkey’s energy sector would take a hit. According to the bill outline, it would target “any foreign person or entity who supplies goods, services, technology, information, or other support that maintains or supports Turkey’s domestic petroleum production and natural gas production for the used by its armed forces.”

There’s also a section about restricting travel for Turkish leaders to the US and filing reports, as well as a part on how humanitarian aid, medical assistance, election help, and intelligence sharing would be exempted. Still, if passed and signed by the president, the legislation would be a major hit on a NATO ally.

The sanctions could come off Turkey if the US certifies that it’s not unilaterally operating in Syria, meaning it either left the area or worked in tandem with the US. The administration has to make a determination on that every 90 days and report to Congress.

There ’ s a lot more to this . Whatever the Russians did or didn ’ t do , they apparently did try to affect or discredit the election . At least that ’ s what Obama claimed three months ago .
On September 5 , President Obama had a ninety-minute meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in China . One of the items discussed was the reported Russian cyberattacks on the U.S. election system . Obama acknowledged the attacks after the meeting , saying that although America had problems with “ cyberintrusions from Russia in the past… [ o ] ur goal is not to suddenly in the cyber arena duplicate a cycle of escalation that we saw when it comes to other arms races in the past.… What we can not do is have the situation in which suddenly this becomes the wild , wild West… ”
Last week Obama said something entirely inconsistent : “ So in early September when I saw president Putin in China , I felt that the most effective way to ensure that that didn ’ t happen was to talk to him directly and tell him to cut it out and there were going to be serious consequences if he didn ’ t . And in fact , we did not see further tampering of the election process — but the leaks… had already occurred. ” He said he ’ d handled the Russian cyberattacks just as he should have .
If you believe what Obama said in September , he decided not to escalate the ongoing cyberwar with Russia to avoid an internet arms race . If you believe what he said last week , he got tough with Putin and told him to knock it off or face terrible consequences after which — he claimed — Putin backed down .
The truth is not something in between , but something altogether different . Putin knows Obama probably better than Obama knows himself . He remembers that in 2012 Obama told Dmitry Medvedev — Putin ’ s surrogate — that Obama would have more flexibility on things such as killing our missile defenses after the 2012 election . He remembers the phony reset of relations presided over by Hillary Clinton that affirmed America ’ s retreat from leadership . So when Obama said in September that he wouldn ’ t respond to Russian cyberattacks by causing a cycle of escalation in cyberwar , Putin knew Obama didn ’ t intend to respond , far less retaliate , to Russian cyberattacks on our elections .
As Donald Rumsfeld was fond of saying , weakness is provocative . Obama ’ s consistent weakness toward Russia has been a license for Russian aggression in cyberwar , Ukraine , Syria , and everywhere else Putin has seen an opportunity to push Russia into the vacuum left by Obama ’ s constant retreat .
Let ’ s not forget how used to Obama ’ s weakness our enemies have become , and how it often it provokes them to action . When Obama warned Bashar Assad against using chemical weapons with his infamous “ red line ” statement , Assad promptly used chemical weapons again and Obama didn ’ t respond . Russia and Iran did by taking control of the Syrian war to defend Assad ’ s regime .
China sees the same American weakness and has been provoked repeatedly to aggression . The latest example is in the Chinese Peoples ’ Liberation Army Navy ( yes , that ’ s what they call it ) seizing an American underwater drone from a U.S. Navy ship last week about fifty miles northwest of the Philippines in the South China Sea .
USNS Bowditch is a surveying ship , not a warship . It was doing an undersea survey ( at least that ’ s what the Navy said ) and had two drones on the surface . A Chinese naval ship came alongside one of the drones , picked it up and sailed away . It was at least an act of piracy and , if we wanted to consider it so , tantamount to an act of war .
The Chinese benefited from the seizure in at least two ways . Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has been trying to make it clear to China that he ’ s willing to abandon his nation ’ s alliance with America in favor of an alliance with China . By seizing the drone fifty miles from the Philippines , China is telling Duterte that he ’ d better finish his realignment because China is stronger and more determined than we are in the region .
The second benefit comes from the fact that what the Bowditch was doing ain ’ t necessarily the same as what the Navy said it was doing . Depending on how they ’ re equipped , undersea drones can be capable of gathering intelligence — i.e. , spying — on lots of things . If , for example , the drones were recording sounds emanating from Chinese submarines , we could have learned a lot about the subs and their sound “ signatures ” which are invaluable to our submarines in anti-submarine warfare . The sound signatures identify each sub with almost the precision that fingerprints identify people .
If the drone was doing something such as that , by seizing it the Chinese could disassemble it ( as they no doubt have already done ) to discover what sensors we have and how good they are ( and copying their design ) . Other secret equipment would also have been compromised to China ’ s benefit and our disadvantage .
No one would suggest that we should go to war over a stolen drone . Obama did as little as he could by sending a diplomatic protest . The Chinese apparently have agreed to return it some time . The Chinese theft of the drone is another example of how Obama ’ s weakness provokes our enemies to more and greater aggression .
On January 20 , Donald Trump will begin reasserting American strength to regain the superpower status that Obama has thrown away . The task Trump faces was described all too well by a former president back in April . He said , “ Unlike when I became president , a lot of things are coming apart around the world now. ” He also said that if we all come together , we might overcome the “ awful legacy ” of the last seven years .

The president ’ s claim that the Syrian Kurds are “ happy ” with the U.S. withdrawal seemed to be contradicted by images of some Kurds throwing rotten vegetables at withdrawing U.S. troops ,
Ahmed Omar , the president of the Syrian Democratic Council , said Monday that the Kurds have been “ saddened ” by the withdrawal and what he said was the slaughter of his people by Turkish forces : “ They [ Turks ] said they want to kill hundreds of thousands of us ... This is why I ask President Trump to stop the attacks ... Help us to reach a political solution . We want peace . We are peaceful people . ”
Just after touting success on Wednesday , though , the president seemed to doubt his own assessment saying permanent is `` questionable '' in that region .
`` However , you would also define the word permanent and that part of the world is somewhat questionable , '' Trump said .
Even as Trump made his announcement , the top U.S. envoy for Syria , Amb . James Jeffrey , was testifying on Capitol Hill and seemed to contradict the president 's assessment of success .
`` The Turkish incursion into northeast Syria is a tragedy , it was long-standing U.S. government policy in two administrations to keep that from happening and we were clearly not successful . ''
The president first teased the announcement on Twitter Wednesday morning .
In his tweet , the president touted “ big success ” on the Turkish-Syria border , heralding that a safe zone has been created and that the ceasefire has held .
`` Big success on the Turkey/Syria Border . Safe Zone created ! Ceasefire has held and combat missions have ended . Kurds are safe and have worked very nicely with us . Captured ISIS prisoners secured . I will be making a statement at 11:00 A.M. from the White House . Thank you ! '' Trump tweeted .

The president 's tweet comes a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced they had reached a separate deal on how to divide up and control northeastern Syria -- from which U.S. forces recently withdrew .
The deal came just before the U.S.-Turkish halt in hostilities reached its deadline , with a senior Trump administration official touting it as `` one of the best ceasefires I 've ever seen . ''
But as the remaining 1,000 U.S. troops withdraw from northeast Syria at President Trump 's command , critics have blasted Trump and his administration for ceding this territory to Turkey , Russia and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad , who has overseen a brutal war against his own people , and giving up leverage to accomplish U.S. goals in the region , including ensuring the defeat of the Islamic State and expelling Iranian forces from Syria that threaten U.S. allies , especially Israel .
The deal between Erdogan and Putin calls for Syrian Kurdish forces and their weapons to be removed from a buffer zone the length of the border in northeastern Syria -- an expansive area where these forces live now that extends 30 kilometers ( 18.6 miles ) in from the border . Turkey would maintain control of the portion it now has , thanks to its agreement with the U.S. , while Assad 's forces , backed by Russia , would secure the rest of it .","President Donald Trump, facing harsh criticism from both Republicans and Democrats for his abrupt decisions on Syria, claimed a ""breakthrough"" on Wednesday, saying the ceasefire on Turkey's border with Syria was now ""permanent.""

""Early this morning, the Government of Turkey ... said that they would be stopping combat and their offensive in Syria, making the ceasefire permanent, and it will indeed be permanent,"" Trump said in a formal statement from the White House.

Trump said sanctions the U.S. imposed on Turkey would be lifted ""unless something happens that we're not happy with.""

""Today’s announcement validates our course of action,"" he said, saying it had been scorned. ""Now, people are saying: 'Wow, what a great outcome.'""

ABC News

He claimed that the ceasefire is the sole outcome of his administration's efforts. Trump's announcement, though, came a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced they had reached a separate deal for control of northeastern Syria -- where U.S forces have been withdrawn.

""This was an outcome created by us, the United States, and nobody else,"" Trump said. ""No other nation, very simple. We're willing to take blame and we're also willing to take credit.""

“We have done them a great service and we've done a great job for all of them,"" he said, speaking of the U.S.-allied Syrian Kurds and Syrian civilians caught in the crossfire. ""And now we're getting out. A long time. We were supposed to be there for 30 days. That was almost 10 years ago,” he said, noting what he said was his promise to get the U.S. out of long-standing wars.

Turkey and Syria have been fighting for centuries, Trump said, adding, ""Let someone else fight over this long-bloodstained sand. We've done a great job and now we're getting out.""

Mr. Obama appears to have his work cut out for him .
For one thing , the meeting Thursday in the leafy , folksy confines of the Maryland presidential retreat is unlikely to address a Persian-Arab rivalry that is cultural , religious , and ideological – not to mention centuries old .
Perhaps even more significant , the summit risks laying bare what some regional analysts say are the glaring “ disconnects ” in the US-Gulf relationship – in particular between Obama ’ s vision of a post-deal Iran and the Gulf leaders ’ fears about a reinvigorated Iran .
“ The US wants the Gulf to be OK with this nuclear deal with Iran , but the Gulf is not OK with it , so there continues to be this disconnect , ” says Karim Sadjadpour , senior Iran policy analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington .
Certainly the leaders and senior officials from six Gulf countries who meet with Obama – for a White House dinner Wednesday night , before the full-day summit at Camp David – will be looking for some immediate and tangible signs of US support . That is likely to lead to some falling back onto conventional forms of “ reassurance , ” some analysts say – like announcements of arms sales including some sophisticated weapons systems , and perhaps stepped-up joint military exercises .
But the summit is unlikely to bridge the wide gaps between host and guests on Iran , as well as on other aspects of the security agenda in the region , some say .
The Gulf states worry not just about Iran having its nuclear program legitimized by the international community , but perhaps even more about Iran receiving a huge financial windfall if international sanctions are soon lifted , further enabling it to spread its influence in Iraq , Lebanon , Syria , and Yemen .
“ Their top concern is that Iran will feel empowered to double down on its practices ” in the region , Mr. Sadjadpour says .
Moreover , the Gulf Arabs worry that this spreading of Iranian influence is not so much a result of US neglect or “ mistakes ” ( such as the invasion of Iraq that toppled Saddam Hussein ) but is in fact the result of “ US policy , ” he adds .
Obama clearly recognizes the profound qualms that the Gulf states have over the emerging nuclear deal with Iran : He announced plans to hold the summit the same day world leaders reached a framework accord with Tehran for a final nuclear agreement .
But the president will try to convince his guests that the nuclear deal holds out the promise of integrating Iran into the “ community of nations ” and making it a more responsible and cooperative presence in the region . But the Saudis and Bahrainis and Qataris who have resisted that argument from the Americans are unlikely to embrace it at Camp David , regional experts say .
“ The Gulf states feel that Iranian actions [ in the region ] are not a consequence of this Iranian president , it ’ s not a consequence of the Islamic Republic .... Quite frankly , they think this is a pattern of Persian expansionism that dates back millennia , ” says Jon Alterman , director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies ( CSIS ) in Washington .
Yet “ while they feel they are fighting a millennium-long struggle , ” he adds , “ I can guarantee you the United States is not going to be committed to fighting a millennium-long struggle against another ethnic group or sectarian group or anything else . ”
Beyond Iran , another “ disconnect ” that regional analysts see is between the Obama vision of regional powers taking greater responsibility for security affairs in their area – and the way Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states are implementing that security role , particularly in Yemen and Libya .
In that sense , the Camp David summit could act as a test of the Obama policy of “ leading from behind ” and delegating greater levels of security responsibilities to regional partners .
“ We do want the Gulf to take greater responsibility – but the way they are doing it is not always helpful , ” says Frederic Wehrey , an expert in Gulf and North Africa security at Carnegie .
As examples of actions that the US has either begrudgingly supported or openly criticized , Mr. Wehrey points to the Saudi air campaign against Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen , Gulf funding for some Syrian rebel groups linked to extremist elements , and United Arab Emirates intervention in Libya against Islamist forces .
“ As we ’ ve seen in Yemen , you also have the problem of what happens when you make allies more capable and then they use your weapons and training to do things that you think are not only against their own interests , but also against US interests , ” Mr. Alterman notes .
If the Camp David summit delivers little more than new arms sales , perhaps some new missile defense initiative , and some joint military exercises , it will be unfortunate on several levels , experts say .
Despite the fixation on Iran , most of the major challenges the Gulf states face are internal , such as providing jobs to a large youth population , undertaking political reform , and countering extremist ideologies – something Obama recognizes , Wehrey says . But he sees the summit only skirting those domestic issues at best .
The summit may very well include the need for reform “ as talking points , ” he says , “ but it will be just that – talking points . ”

WASHINGTON ( AP ) — President Donald Trump says he and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are “ very good friends , ” but their meeting Wednesday at the White House failed to resolve an issue that has badly strained relations between the two NATO allies .
Trump and Erdogan concluded a visit without achieving an agreement on Turkey ’ s decision earlier this year to accept delivery of a Russian air defense system that poses such a threat to NATO security that the U.S. suspended Turkish participation in the multinational F-35 fighter jet program .
The Turkish president told reporters he might be persuaded to use the U.S.-made Patriot system “ as well ” as the Russian S-400 . Trump said they would agree to keep working on the issue .
“ The acquisition of the S-400 creates some very serious challenges for us , ” Trump said . “ Hopefully we ’ ll be able to resolve that situation . ”
Despite the differences , Trump said he believes the two sides can substantially increase trade , which amounted to about $ 24 billion in 2017 .
“ We think we can bring trade up very quickly to about $ 100 billion between our countries , ” Trump said .
The dispute over the competing air defense systems is a major component of the tension between the two countries . Turkey has also come under fire on Capitol Hill for its incursion into Syria last month to attack the Kurdish forces that fought with the U.S. against the Islamic State . And Turkey has been criticized for repression of political opponents , journalists and others .
Turkey , meanwhile , is angered at the U.S. for supporting the Kurdish forces it views as a threat and for refusing to extradite a Muslim cleric it accuses of fomenting a 2016 coup attempt against Erdogan .
Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , acknowledged Turkey ’ s concerns regarding certain Kurdish elements of the Syrian Democratic Forces that partnered with the U.S. , but said they should be addressed by creating a safe zone and not with a “ disruptive ” incursion that “ must end . ”
He also said nearly all lawmakers in Congress see the S-400 as being incompatible with America ’ s F-35 .
“ Turkey ’ s activation of the Russian S-400 will require the U.S. to keep Turkey from the F-35 program and issue sanctions , ” Graham said . “ Turkey has been a valuable ally and member of NATO . I ’ m hoping to salvage this relationship , but only time will tell if that is possible . ”
Erdogan used the meeting as a chance to defend his military offensive against U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria , some of whom have links to the separatists who have waged a violent campaign in Turkey for decades .
“ We ’ re just fighting terrorists , period , ” he said . “ If you don ’ t fight back , you will have to pay a very hefty price . ”
His words failed to placate members of Congress and others who accuse Turkish-backed forces of killing Kurdish civilians and causing a humanitarian crisis in the incursion , which prompted the U.S. last month to hurriedly evacuate a small number of American troops from near the Syria-Turkey border .
“ There has been a callous disregard for civilian lives , including attacks on residential areas , ” said Margaret Huang , executive director of Amnesty International USA .
The leaders ’ scheduled afternoon news conference , following a meeting with Republican lawmakers at the White House , gave Trump a stage to counter the first public hearings in the House impeachment inquiry . Trump said he was busy and didn ’ t watch a minute of the televised hearings , which he called a “ hoax . ”
Republicans and Democrats in Congress didn ’ t think Trump should meet with Erdogan at all .
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y. , said it was “ mindboggling ” and “ appalling ” for Trump to roll out a red carpet for Erdogan after the invasion of Syria .
“ Erdogan suppresses free speech , arrests opponents and does so many other terribly things to his country , which was once a much more shining example of democracy , ” Schumer said .
In the Senate , two Democrats have introduced legislation denouncing Turkey ’ s targeting of journalists , political opponents , dissidents , minorities and others . They said the Turkish government had imprisoned more than 80,000 Turkish citizens , closed more than 1,500 non-governmental organizations on terrorism-related grounds and dismissed or suspended more than 130,000 civil servants from their jobs .
During the news conference , Trump joked that Erdogan should only call on a friendly Turkish reporter . When Erdogan called on a female Turkish reporter , according to several people in the room , Graham leaned over and quietly told someone seated next to him , “ She ’ s the only reporter left over there ” in Turkey .

OSAKA , Japan — President Donald Trump on Saturday stepped back from an escalation of his trade war with China that threatened to damage his 2020 reelection chances .
During a 80-minute meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping , Trump agreed not to proceed with plans to impose a 25 percent duty on another $ 300 billion worth of Chinese goods .
“ We ’ re holding on tariffs , and they ’ re going to buy farm product , ” Trump told reporters during a press conference after his meeting with Xi at the annual G-20 leaders summit here in Osaka .
American farm exports to China have plummeted as a result of the trade war . Total sales this budget year are forecast at $ 6 billion , down from a high of nearly $ 26 billion when Barack Obama was president .
The decision to halt additional tariffs will also be welcome news to retailers and consumers , especially lower-income voters who rely on cheap imports , going into the 2020 election .
The United States will keep in place a 25 percent duty on $ 250 billion of Chinese goods that Trump imposed earlier . It will also give China a list of U.S. products to buy , Trump said .
In what appears to be a concession to Xi , Trump said he would loosen a trade ban that his administration recently imposed on Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei .
The president indicated he thought the restrictions were too tight because Huawei is a major customer for many U.S. technology products .
“ We send and we sell to Huawei a tremendous amount of product that goes into the various things they make , ” Trump said . “ These are American companies that make product . It 's very complex . Highly scientific . And in some cases we 're the ones that do it and the only ones that do it . ”
However , Trump said the ultimate resolution of the Huawei issue would be left until the end of negotiations with China .
Trump also said he did not discuss the case of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou , who was arrested in Canada last December at the request of the United States over allegations of breaching a U.S.-imposed ban on dealing with Iran .
But in response to a reporter ’ s question , he said the administration would discuss the telecommunications company 's continued presence on the Commerce Department ’ s “ entity list ” in the coming days . Later , he said Huawei was “ very much in play , ” but repeated that the U.S.and China plan to resolve the issue at the end of the talks .
In another area , he indicated his desire to reform U.S. visa policy to allow Chinese students remain and work in the United States after they finish their education . He called it a “ smart person ’ s waiver . ”
“ We ’ ll make it so they can not only stay , but maybe they have access to green cards . We want to keep them here , ” Trump said .

OSAKA, Japan — President Donald Trump on Saturday stepped back from an escalation of his trade war with China that threatened to damage his 2020 reelection chances.

“We’re holding on tariffs, and they’re going to buy farm product,” Trump told reporters during a press conference after his meeting with Xi at the annual G-20 leaders summit here in Osaka.

American farm exports to China have plummeted as a result of the trade war. Total sales this budget year are forecast at $6 billion, down from a high of nearly $26 billion when Barack Obama was president.

The decision to halt additional tariffs will also be welcome news to retailers and consumers, especially lower-income voters who rely on cheap imports, going into the 2020 election.

The United States will keep in place a 25 percent duty on $250 billion of Chinese goods that Trump imposed earlier. It will also give China a list of U.S. products to buy, Trump said.

In what appears to be a concession to Xi, Trump said he would loosen a trade ban that his administration recently imposed on Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei.

The president indicated he thought the restrictions were too tight because Huawei is a major customer for many U.S. technology products.

Afghanistan 's ambassador to the US , Hamdullah Mohib , told CNN 's Brooke Baldwin that the bomb was dropped after fighting had intensified over the last week between US Special Forces and Afghan troops against ISIS .

ISIS first emerged in the summer of 2015 in the country 's east , fast gaining ground and support , often among disaffected Taliban or Afghan youth .

The US counterterrorism mission is separate from the NATO-led effort to train, advise and assist the Afghan army and police force.

While ISIS is identified primarily with its presence in Iraq and Syria, US and coalition officials have long expressed concern about a growing presence in Afghanistan.

ISIS first emerged in the summer of 2015 in the country's east, fast gaining ground and support, often among disaffected Taliban or Afghan youth.

US military officials have said the ISIS branch is largely comprised of former members of regional terror groups, including the Pakistani Taliban and Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan.

A US official told CNN that the military estimates are that the Afghan affiliate of ISIS has about 600 to 800 fighters, primarily based in two to three districts in southern Nangarhar. There are also a small number of ISIS operatives in Kunar province as well, the official added.

The Afghan offshoot's link to the organization's Syria-based leadership has been questioned. Many say in fact the Afghan ISIS fighters came from Pakistan and adopted the group's branding in order to get financing.",www.cnn.com,left,GsoMpLcXYqoRFtmk

Those questions remain unanswered as of Friday , after news broke that Robert Harward , a retired Navy vice admiral with decades of military-leadership experience , turned down Trump ’ s offer to take over as national security adviser after the president reportedly denied Harward ’ s request to replace the former Fox News pundit who would be serving as his deputy .
The initial news of Harward ’ s potential appointment came as a relief to national-security experts , who voiced their opinion online and elsewhere and reportedly respect Harward as a professional , not an ideologue , as Flynn was perceived by many . His relationship with Defense secretary James Mattis , his former boss at U.S. Central Command , would have been a boon to the White House as well , perhaps even conferring some semblance of order within the West Wing . But as multiple news outlets reported Thursday night , Harward was fundamentally uncomfortable taking charge of a National Security Council staffed with Trump ’ s political advisers , and was turned off by the “ unwillingness of White House political team to be deferential to the White House national security team ” and the “ unwillingness of [ the ] White House political team to be malleable , ” per a source .

Trump ’ s decision to lose Harward rather than sacrifice McFarland was seen as an alarming sign by some in the national-security community .

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to Congress on Tuesday to warn Americans of the anti-Western threats from theocratic — and likely to soon be nuclear — Iran.

Mr. Netanyahu came to the United States to outline the Iranian plan to remake the Middle East with a new nuclear arsenal. His warning was delivered over the objections of the Obama administration, which wants to cut a deal with Iran that allows the theocracy to continue to enrich lots of uranium.

Mr. Netanyahu received a standing ovation for stating the obvious. Iran is currently the greatest global sponsor of terrorism. Tehran now has de facto control over four Middle East nations: Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. Iran has serially ignored all past U.S. deadlines to stop nuclear enrichment. It habitually misled United Nations inspectors. It threatens to spark a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.

At one point the Iranian economy was sputtering due to Western sanctions. Hundreds of thousands of reformers hit the streets of Tehran in 2009 to protest what they believed to be the fraudulent results of a presidential election. The theocracy was worried that its nuclear plans would either cause economic collapse due to the sanctions or prompt some sort of Western military response.

But all of that has changed due to the Obama administration’s zeal to conclude an agreement with Iran at any cost.

For the last six years, lots of American allies, besides Israel, have become scared of this strange new diffidence of the United States — as if the Obama administration feels that America’s prior prominence as leader and protector of the West was either unwarranted, too costly, or resulted in an unfair world order in need of adjustment.

President Obama entered office promising reset diplomacy with Russia. He declared an end to former President George W. Bush’s punitive measures against Russia — as if somehow the United States, not Russia, was responsible for the growing estrangement.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, however, interpreted the reset as American guilt. He assumed there would be few consequences to gobbling up the Crimea and eastern Ukraine in the same way that he had sliced off parts of Georgia. So far, he has been right. No wonder that he eyes the Baltic states next.

Controversy surrounds the creation and spread of the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. But there is no disagreement about what followed Mr. Obama’s abrupt withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq, as he fulfilled a campaign promise.

At one time the administration bragged of Iraq as possibly its “greatest achievement,” and as being “stable” and “secure.” But the precipitous pullout led to anarchy and a fertile landscape in which the Islamic State could thrive. After 2011, it turned out that the absence of U.S. troops in Iraq, not their presence, had enabled the savage terrorists.

The same muddle characterized American policy in Syria. Syrian President Bashar Assad ignored Mr. Obama’s “red line” by using chemical weapons, but Mr. Obama imposed no consequences. Then, Secretary of State John Kerry was reduced to asking Mr. Putin to negotiate a face-saving compromise — as if somehow the U.S., not Syria, had overstepped.

In reaction to a series of terrorist crises — the shootings at Fort Hood, the bombings at the Boston Marathon, the killings in Ottawa and Sydney, and, most recently, the murder of journalists and Jewish citizens in Paris — the Obama administration has refused even to utter the phrase “radical Islam.”

Amid such moral confusion, who is the American enemy and who is the ally? Mr. Netanyahu has received more administration invective than has Iran — as if a Western democratic nation, not the specter of a nuclear Iran, was the source of growing tensions.

The common theme in all these examples is that somehow the United States (or its allies) is portrayed as being culpable for current problems — not the autocratic, theocratic thugs who invade their neighbors, threaten to obliterate democracies and see terror as a legitimate tool of state policy.

The Obama administration’s paralysis is not just rhetorical. For the first time since 2001, defense spending will dip below 4 percent of gross domestic product, as the Army, Navy and Air Force shrink to near-record postwar levels.

The astronomical $18 trillion in national debt was not the only cause of military cutbacks. America’s enemies understood that even massive defense cuts — and tax hikes — still did not offset vast increases in social spending, resulting in annual deficits that still run over $500 billion.

Unfortunately, throughout history, leaders who have appeared weary and sounded apologetic have invited chaos. And chaos encourages war — all the more so when weakness appears so audacious.

foreign_policy,BBC News,1,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-51615907,Trump India visit: Seven claims about India fact-checked,,Reality Check Team,"President Trump kicked off a visit to India with an address to tens of thousands of people in a cricket stadium in Ahmedabad , in the state of Gujarat .
The speech praised India 's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and highlighted the success of recent policies to improve the country .
Claim 1 : Trump said : `` Since the turn of the century , the size of the Indian economy has grown over six times in size . ''
Reality check : Measured in terms of GDP - the sum of the value of goods and services produced in the economy - President Trump is correct .
In 2000 , India 's GDP was $ 477 billion , according to the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) . By 2019 , that figure had risen to an estimated $ 2,940bn .
That 's an increase of 6.2 times over the period 2000-2019 .
Reality Check has previously looked at Prime Minister Modi 's pledge to expand India 's manufacturing sector .
India became the world 's fifth largest economy in 2019 , according to data from the IMF 's World Economic Outlook .
Claim 2 : `` In a single decade , India has lifted over 270 million people out of poverty . ''
Reality check : According to a 2018 UN report , there were 271 million fewer people living below the UN-defined poverty index in 2016 , than ten years earlier .
However , this same report notes that despite the gains in reducing poverty `` 364 million Indians continue to experience acute deprivations in health , nutrition , schooling and sanitation . ''
It also notes that about a quarter of all those defined as living in poverty are under the age of 10 .
Claim 3 : `` Under Prime Minister Modi , for the first time , every village in India has access to electricity . ''
Reality check : In 2018 the Indian government announced that it had reached its target of providing every Indian village with electricity .
The government defines a village as fully electrified if 10 % of its households , as well as public places such as schools and health centres , are connected to the grid .
By the time Mr Modi took office in 2014 , 96 % of the 600,000 villages in India had already been electrified .
We checked this claim in full during last year 's elections in India .
Claim 4 : `` The pace of highway constructions has more than doubled . ''
Reality check : It 's true that the total length of highways increased significantly after Mr Modi 's BJP party came to power .
The government built about 10,000km of highway in 2018-19 . This is more than double the amount built in the last year of the previous Congress administration in 2013-14 .
The government set a similar target for this year . As of November 2019 , 5,958km have been built .
Reality Check has looked in-depth at the BJP 's record on building roads .
Claim 5 : `` 320 million more Indians are right now connected to the internet . ''
Reality check : It 's not entirely clear what internet connection refers to here . There are now more than 600m internet subscribers in India - a measure of internet use published by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India .
This figure has grown enormously in recent years , surpassing the 320m figure mentioned by President Trump .
However , you 're much more likely to have access to the internet if you live in a city rather than in the countryside - where most Indians live . There 's also a gender disparity .
Women are 50 % less likely to use mobile internet than men , according to a 2019 study .
Last year , Reality Check found that an ambitious project to establish the internet across rural India made strong progress early on , but was struggling to meet targets .
Claim 6 : `` 600 million more people have access to basic sanitation . ''
Reality check : In October 2014 , Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Swachh Bharat or Clean India Mission .
The government built toilets for households with no access to basic sanitation facilities under this scheme .
Latest figures from the Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation show that more than 100 million toilets have been built . We ca n't assess the figure of 600m , but every toilet would probably be used by multiple people .
In April 2018 , the prime minister also declared India open-defecation free .
Reality Check has shown that rates of open defecation have fallen , although UN data indicates that the practice is still widespread .
Claim 7 : `` 70 million more households , think of this , have access to cooking fuel . ''

President Trump kicked off a visit to India with an address to tens of thousands of people in a cricket stadium in Ahmedabad, in the state of Gujarat.

The speech praised India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and highlighted the success of recent policies to improve the country.

We looked at some of the claims.

Claim 1: Trump said: ""Since the turn of the century, the size of the Indian economy has grown over six times in size.""

Reality check: Measured in terms of GDP - the sum of the value of goods and services produced in the economy - President Trump is correct.

In 2000, India's GDP was $477 billion, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). By 2019, that figure had risen to an estimated $2,940bn.

That's an increase of 6.2 times over the period 2000-2019.

Reality Check has previously looked at Prime Minister Modi's pledge to expand India's manufacturing sector.

India became the world's fifth largest economy in 2019, according to data from the IMF's World Economic Outlook.

World's largest economies GDP (US$ trillions)

Claim 2: ""In a single decade, India has lifted over 270 million people out of poverty.""

Reality check: According to a 2018 UN report, there were 271 million fewer people living below the UN-defined poverty index in 2016, than ten years earlier.

However, this same report notes that despite the gains in reducing poverty ""364 million Indians continue to experience acute deprivations in health, nutrition, schooling and sanitation.""

It also notes that about a quarter of all those defined as living in poverty are under the age of 10.

Claim 3: ""Under Prime Minister Modi, for the first time, every village in India has access to electricity.""

Reality check: In 2018 the Indian government announced that it had reached its target of providing every Indian village with electricity.

However, it's important to know what this actually means.

The government defines a village as fully electrified if 10% of its households, as well as public places such as schools and health centres, are connected to the grid.

By the time Mr Modi took office in 2014, 96% of the 600,000 villages in India had already been electrified.

We checked this claim in full during last year's elections in India.

Claim 4: ""The pace of highway constructions has more than doubled.""

Reality check: It's true that the total length of highways increased significantly after Mr Modi's BJP party came to power.

The government built about 10,000km of highway in 2018-19. This is more than double the amount built in the last year of the previous Congress administration in 2013-14.

National highways in India Total built each fiscal year

The government set a similar target for this year. As of November 2019, 5,958km have been built.

Reality Check has looked in-depth at the BJP's record on building roads.

Claim 5: ""320 million more Indians are right now connected to the internet.""

Reality check: It's not entirely clear what internet connection refers to here. There are now more than 600m internet subscribers in India - a measure of internet use published by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India.

This figure has grown enormously in recent years, surpassing the 320m figure mentioned by President Trump.

India's broadband users

However, you're much more likely to have access to the internet if you live in a city rather than in the countryside - where most Indians live. There's also a gender disparity.

Women are 50% less likely to use mobile internet than men, according to a 2019 study.

Last year, Reality Check found that an ambitious project to establish the internet across rural India made strong progress early on, but was struggling to meet targets.

Claim 6: ""600 million more people have access to basic sanitation.""

Reality check: In October 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Swachh Bharat or Clean India Mission.

The government built toilets for households with no access to basic sanitation facilities under this scheme.

Latest figures from the Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation show that more than 100 million toilets have been built. We can't assess the figure of 600m, but every toilet would probably be used by multiple people.

In April 2018, the prime minister also declared India open-defecation free.

Reality Check has shown that rates of open defecation have fallen, although UN data indicates that the practice is still widespread.

Claim 7: ""70 million more households, think of this, have access to cooking fuel.""

Reality check: Cooking gas was provided to poor households under a scheme launched by Prime Minister Modi in 2016.

Under this scheme, 50 million liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) connections were to be provided to families below a certain level of income, with additional financial subsidies provided to refill cylinders for three years.

According to the website of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, the Indian government fulfilled its target, and more than 80 million connections have been established as of September last year.

In our own assessment last year, Reality Check found that the success of the project has been hampered by the high cost of having cylinders refilled.

Terrorism calls for longer-term approach,2016-03-24,Howard Lafranchi,"The terrorist attacks in Brussels this week brought out a desire for a quick fix to Islamist radicalism – particularly among Republican presidential candidates – and for President Obama to get much faster to the “ destroy ” part of his “ defeat and ultimately destroy ” strategy for dealing with the Islamic State .
Yet as appealing as the idea of an overwhelming military offensive that finishes off Islamic State power bases might be , most counterterrorism experts specializing in Islamist extremism caution that a one-and-done blitz of the Islamic State ( IS ) in Syria , Iraq , and in Libya would only temporarily address the problem .
And in the long run , it could very well make matters worse – a lesson some say the United States has learned from recent experience in Iraq .
“ If we wanted to defeat the Islamic State tomorrow , we could do it . The problem is that no one has done the work to create a situation on the ground after we defeat them that would be stable and less prone to extremism , ” says Matthew Levitt , an Islamist-terrorism expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy . “ We ’ ve done this before , and we know we could end up with something even more lethal and dangerous . ”
What Mr. Levitt is referring to is the US defeat a decade ago of Al Qaeda in Iraq , the precursor of IS . “ We defeated AQI , but that did nothing to address the conditions that gave rise to the group , ” he says , “ and so at the end of the day we got something worse , and more complicated to deal with . ”
Yet even as counterterrorism experts argue against the appeal of the hammer-blow response and warn that the war on Islamist terrorism won ’ t be over tomorrow , they also cite reasons for optimism about prospects for winning the fight .
Among them : Many of the lessons learned from battling Islamist terrorism for over a decade are being put into practice . As a result , the US is better positioned today ( particularly in comparison to Europe ) to address the terrorism scourge .
“ We learned the hard way with the tragedy of 9/11 that coordination of intelligence agencies and intelligence sharing is absolutely key , ” says Christine Fair , an associate professor of peace and security studies at Georgetown University in Washington . “ Most of us know that we really can ’ t just bomb our way out of this problem , ” she says , “ and we ’ ve learned that here at home you have to have partners in the Muslim communities who feel engaged and let us know when something ’ s not right . ”
The application of those lessons , along with the relatively successful record of keeping the US free of major terrorist attacks , tell Dr. Fair the US is on the right track . “ Here we are 'the Great Satan , ' the Western power the extremists and terrorists want most to strike , and given how vulnerable we are , you consider our record and you have to conclude that clearly we ’ re doing something right . ”
That does not mean the US has done everything right – or couldn ’ t have done more earlier to halt IS ’ s rise to a place where it is able to coordinate and set in motion distant terrorist attacks like those in Brussels and last year in Paris .
“ There was an opportunity when we could have decimated them , when they were clearly the bad guys but not yet deeply embedded in the civilian populations ” of Syria and Iraq ’ s Sunni Arab communities , Fair says , “ but we let that pass. ” She cites the summer before the midterm elections of 2014 as the last best opportunity for Obama to launch debilitating strikes against IS .
Levitt of the Washington Institute also says there were things the US could have done earlier to impede IS from becoming so entrenched .
But given the situation now , he and others say the responses some presidential candidates are calling for – carpet bombing IS in its strongholds and water-boarding captured IS militants to extract information ( Donald Trump ) , or singling out US Muslim communities for special police surveillance ( Ted Cruz ) – would be counterproductive and serve the purposes of IS , also known as ISIS .
“ The problem with the carpet-bombing approach is that it does nothing to deal with the after-ISIS [ question ] , ” says Nicholas Heras , a research associate in Middle East security at the Center for a New American Security in Washington . “ If all you do is displace them without preparing local populations to deal with the ungoverned spaces , you ’ re simply paving the way for the emergence of a new ISIS . ”
At the same time , the substantial loss of civilian life that would accompany an indiscriminate attack on IS would play into the IS “ crusader ” narrative and become a strong recruitment tool , he says .
Restrictive and discriminatory steps against US Muslims would also further IS ’ s playbook , others say . “ They ’ d like nothing better than to taunt us into taking a knee-jerk turn into Islamophobia , ” says Fair . “ That would start us down the road to expanding the population of grievance on which groups like ISIS thrive and operate . ”
Alienating US Muslims , a population that is generally more prosperous and better integrated than its European counterparts , could deprive the US of one of the major advantages it has in fighting Islamist terrorism , Levitt says .
“ Our European allies are going to have an uphill battle combating these threats reaching into their cities from IS , ” he says . “ So while they are dealing with the issues of social cohesion that are making their problems worse , we should guard against doing things that set us back and make matters worse . ”
Pentagon officials say it will likely be year-end before Iraqi forces , now being trained by the US , will ready to launch an assault to take back Mosul , Iraq ’ s second-largest city that since 2014 has been under IS control . A battle to take back Raqqa , IS ’ s headquarters in Syria , will depend in part on the outcome of the Syria peace process under way in Geneva .
But in the meantime , steps can be taken to help prevent the emergence of new groups like IS , experts say .

Interested in Afghanistan ? Add Afghanistan as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Afghanistan news , video , and analysis from ███ . Add Interest
Formally known as the GBU-43 , or massive ordnance air blast ( MOAB ) bomb , it was developed in 2003 .
`` At 7:32 p.m. local time today , U.S . Forces – Afghanistan conducted a strike on an ISIS-K tunnel complex in Achin district , Nangarhar province , Afghanistan , as part of ongoing efforts to defeat ISIS-K in Afghanistan in 2017 , '' U.S . Forces – Afghanistan said in a statement Thursday . ISIS-K refers to ISIS-Khorasan , an ISIS affiliate in Afghanistan that mainly operates in the eastern part of the country . Achin is right on the border with Pakistan .
Thursday was the first time the MOAB has been used in combat .
`` The strike used a GBU-43 bomb dropped from a U.S. aircraft , '' the statement continued . `` The strike was designed to minimize the risk to Afghan and U.S. forces conducting clearing operations in the area while maximizing the destruction of ISIS-K fighters and facilities . ''
The bomb was dropped from the rear of an MC-130 aircraft , said Adam Stump , a Pentagon spokesman .
The bomb is so large that it is carried in the cargo hold of the aircraft then rolled out the plane 's rear door toward its target .

Formally known as the GBU-43, or massive ordnance air blast (MOAB) bomb, it was developed in 2003.

""At 7:32 p.m. local time today, U.S. Forces – Afghanistan conducted a strike on an ISIS-K tunnel complex in Achin district, Nangarhar province, Afghanistan, as part of ongoing efforts to defeat ISIS-K in Afghanistan in 2017,"" U.S. Forces – Afghanistan said in a statement Thursday. ISIS-K refers to ISIS-Khorasan, an ISIS affiliate in Afghanistan that mainly operates in the eastern part of the country. Achin is right on the border with Pakistan.

Thursday was the first time the MOAB has been used in combat.

""The strike used a GBU-43 bomb dropped from a U.S. aircraft,"" the statement continued. ""The strike was designed to minimize the risk to Afghan and U.S. forces conducting clearing operations in the area while maximizing the destruction of ISIS-K fighters and facilities.""

The bomb was dropped from the rear of an MC-130 aircraft, said Adam Stump, a Pentagon spokesman.

The bomb is so large that it is carried in the cargo hold of the aircraft then rolled out the plane's rear door toward its target.

While the MOAB is the largest non-nuclear bomb ever used in combat, it is not the largest non-nuclear bomb in the U.S. military's arsenal. That is the massive ordnance penetrator (MOP), which is 30,000 pounds.

Defense officials said Gen. John Nicholson, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, had the authorities to use the bomb as part of the larger authorities to fight ISIS granted to his command in January 2016.

The officials said the planning to use the bomb had been under way for months during the Obama administration and that the bomb had been in Afghanistan for months.

One official described the use of the MOAB as ""the right weapon, the right target, and the desired effect.”

Afghan forces and the American troops advising them have engaged in heavy fighting with ISIS forces in Afghanistan over the past year.

An American special operations soldier was killed last weekend in combat operations against ISIS in Nangarhar province, where the bomb was dropped. A defense official told ABC News there was no link to that incident since the bomb drop had been planned months ago.

Asked Thursday if he authorized the strike, President Donald Trump said he authorized the military.

“Everybody knows exactly what happened, and what I do is I authorize my military … we’ve given them total authorization,"" he said.

He added, “Frankly, that’s why they’ve been so successful lately,” saying recent weeks stand in contrast to the last eight years under former President Barack Obama.

But Trump may have been referring to the broader authorities provided to the U.S. military in the fight against ISIS in Afghanistan since a defense official said the use of the bomb did not require presidential authority.

Editor's note: An earlier version of this story, citing the U.S. military, stated that the MOAB is the largest non-nuclear weapon in the U.S. military’s arsenal. This story has since been updated to reflect that the MOAB is the largest non-nuclear weapon ever used in combat by the U.S.

foreign_policy,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/sep/25/obama-us-will-stop-iran-developing-nukes/,"At U.N., Obama downplays terrorism in Libya attack ",2012-09-25,Dave Boyer,"His expected campaign advantage on foreign-policy issues suddenly in doubt , President Obama at the United Nations on Tuesday portrayed the deaths of four Americans in Libya as a result of inflamed tensions over an anti-Islam movie produced in the U.S. rather than a terrorist attack aimed at his policies in dealing with the Arab Spring and Middle East unrest .
Although his administration in recent days acknowledged that the deaths of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three others were caused by a terrorist act on Sept. 11 , Mr. Obama didn ’ t mention terrorism as the likely motive in front of an international audience at the U.N. General Assembly ’ s annual gathering . After referencing the killing of the ambassador , Mr. Obama focused much of his speech on promoting religious tolerance and free speech , blaming the film for provoking the anti-U.S. outbursts while saying there is never an excuse for violence .
“ In every country , there are those who find different religious beliefs threatening ; in every culture , those who love freedom for themselves must ask themselves how much they ’ re willing to tolerate freedom for others , ” Mr. Obama said . “ That is what we saw play out in the last two weeks , as a crude and disgusting video sparked outrage throughout the Muslim world . ”
The White House has sparred in recent days with the campaign of GOP challenger Mitt Romney over whether the administration was too quick to condemn the U.S.-based makers of the film instead of the radical Islamic elements in the region who responded with violent protests that resulted in some 40 deaths across the region .
Mr. Obama also said there is “ still time and space ” to resolve the international impasse over Iran ’ s suspect nuclear programs , although “ that time is not unlimited ” for Tehran to make a deal .
He also said it is time for Syrian President Bashar Assad to step down in the face of a raging popular revolt .
“ Make no mistake : A nuclear-armed Iran is not a challenge that can be contained , ” Mr. Obama said . “ It would threaten the elimination of Israel , the security of Gulf nations and the unraveling of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . ”
But Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who addresses the U.N. gathering Wednesday , sounded a defiant note in a meeting with reporters Monday , while Iranian military leaders in Tehran released details of a long-range drone and test-fired four anti-ship missiles in a prelude to upcoming naval war games planned in an apparent response to U.S.-led warship drills in the Persian Gulf .
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon picked up on Mr. Obama ’ s warnings over Syria , telling world leaders that international action was needed to end the violence in the 18-month-old conflict that , he said , has become “ a regional calamity with global ramifications . ”
“ The international community should not look the other way as violence spirals out of control , ” Mr. Ban said .
Downplaying the role of terrorism in the Libya attack was yet another shift in Mr. Obama ’ s explanation for the violence . In the days after the assault , the administration blamed the reports of the anti-Islamic video . Then last week , U.S. officials began to acknowledge that the attack bore the signs of terrorism .
The Libyan prime minister said the attack on the U.S. Consulate in the Libyan city of Benghazi was planned , and the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence said there was reason to believe that al Qaeda or its affiliates carried out the killings .
Even on Monday , while taping a TV segment of “ The View ” in New York , Mr. Obama indicated that the Libyan attack was the work of terrorists .
“ There ’ s no doubt that the kind of weapons that were used , the ongoing assault , that it wasn ’ t just a mob action , ” Mr. Obama said .
The consulate was attacked during anti-U.S. protests that have roiled the Middle East over the past two weeks , calling into question Mr. Obama ’ s approach to foreign policy in the Muslim world .
The shifting reasons for the attack in Libya also highlighted a challenge for Mr. Obama in the presidential race , where he is presenting himself to voters as the experienced hand compared with Mr. Romney . At the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte , N.C. , this month , the president portrayed his Republican opponent as new to foreign policy .
Mr. Obama is under increasing criticism from the right over his handling of Iran ’ s suspected nuclear weapons program and his perceived reluctance to give full-throated cooperation to Israel in stopping Iran from developing a weapon of mass destruction .
The president sought to allay those concerns Tuesday by telling the U.N. that his administration “ will do what we must ” to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon .
Mr. Romney , addressing former President Bill Clinton ’ s international foundation in New York earlier in the day , insisted again that the Benghazi attack was an act of terrorism . A spokeswoman for Mr. Romney ’ s campaign added that , more broadly , the president is failing to lead internationally .
“ For nearly four years , President Obama ’ s foreign policy has left our closest allies alienated and our security threatened , ” said Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul . “ Instead of delivering a ‘ new beginning ’ with Iran , the president ’ s failed policies have allowed Iran to move closer toward nuclear-weapons capability . Our national security and allies in the Middle East can ’ t afford four more years like the last four years under President Obama . As president , Mitt Romney will ensure that Iran is never permitted to develop a nuclear-weapons capability . ”
But Mr. Obama devoted the bulk of his speech to explaining his approach to the Muslim world in light of the widespread backlash against the U.S . He asked other cultures to accept the American principle of free speech while laying much of the blame for the violence on the “ disgusting ” video .
“ I know there are some who ask why we don ’ t just ban such a video , ” Mr. Obama said . “ The answer is enshrined in our laws : Our Constitution protects the right to practice free speech . Here in the United States , countless publications provoke offense . Like me , the majority of Americans are Christian , and yet we do not ban blasphemy against our most sacred beliefs . ”
The president held himself up as an example of someone who shrugs off offensive commentary .
“ As president of our country , and commander in chief of our military , I accept that people are going to call me awful things every day , and I will always defend their right to do so , ” he said . “ Americans have fought and died around the globe to protect the right of all people to express their views — even views that we disagree with . ”
He used the story of Mr. Stevens ’ life as the ideal of American foreign service and said other cultures should appreciate the diplomat ’ s commitment to improving the countries where he worked .
“ I tell you this story because Chris Stevens embodied the best of America , ” Mr. Obama said . “ He acted with humility , but stood up for a set of principles — a belief that individuals should be free to determine their own destiny , and live with liberty , dignity , justice and opportunity . ”
The president said leaders in every country have an obligation “ to speak out forcefully against violence and extremism . ”
“ It is time to marginalize those who — even when not resorting to violence — use hatred of America , or the West , or Israel as a central principle of politics , ” he said . “ For that only gives cover , and sometimes makes excuses , for those who resort to violence . That brand of politics — one that pits East against West ; South against North ; Muslim against Christian , Hindu and Jew — can not deliver the promise of freedom . Burning an American flag will do nothing to educate a child . Smashing apart a restaurant will not fill an empty stomach . Attacking an embassy won ’ t create a single job . That brand of politics only makes it harder to achieve what we must do together : educating our children and creating the opportunities they deserve ; protecting human rights ; and extending democracy ’ s promise . ”
But his call for other countries to embrace American-style free-speech standards met with a mixed reaction from the gathering .
The foreign minister of Indonesia , home to the world ’ s largest Muslim population , said Mr. Obama ’ s speech was a “ clarion call ” for all nations to reject intolerance . He said it is “ an issue that galvanizes all of us , ” according to the Associated Press . But Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa added that freedom of expression should be exercised with consideration to morality and public order .
Dina Zakaria , a spokeswoman for the Muslim Brotherhood ’ s Freedom and Justice political party , said cultural differences between the U.S. and the Muslim and Arab world over the limitations of freedom of expression will persist .
“ No one can argue against freedom of expression , but the Western understanding of it is different from ours , ” she said . “ Will this freedom allow for contempt of religion ? For us , it is different . For us , it is a red line as Muslims and Christians as well . ”

North Korea does n't really do Christmas cards , but if it did , its card would probably have a picture of the nation 's leader , Kim Jong Un , riding a white horse through a snowy wilderness . In fact , North Korean state media released those exact images this month , and the message was clear : Kim , frustrated with how things were going , was pondering a new direction .
`` The idea is that he was making this journey to commune with the universe in order to settle on his course , '' says Jeffrey Lewis , a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies , who tracks North Korea .
Kim is tired of two years of failed diplomacy with the U.S. and South Korea . North Korea wants sanctions relief . But the U.S. has refused to budge unless the North gives up its entire nuclear arsenal — something it 's not willing to do .

North Korea doesn't really do Christmas cards, but if it did, its card would probably have a picture of the nation's leader, Kim Jong Un, riding a white horse through a snowy wilderness. In fact, North Korean state media released those exact images this month, and the message was clear: Kim, frustrated with how things were going, was pondering a new direction.

""The idea is that he was making this journey to commune with the universe in order to settle on his course,"" says Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, who tracks North Korea.

Kim is tired of two years of failed diplomacy with the U.S. and South Korea. North Korea wants sanctions relief. But the U.S. has refused to budge unless the North gives up its entire nuclear arsenal — something it's not willing to do.

For a while, both sides ignored the gap to get good press and photo-ops, but that time may have passed. ""They just aren't able to paper over those differences any longer,"" Lewis says.

Now North Korea's leadership is promising a ""Christmas gift"" for the Americans. Here are the options:

Space launch

North Korea could launch a rocket with a satellite or other payload into space. Such a move would be seen as provocative by the U.S., but North Korea would be able to claim it was peaceful, according to Ankit Panda, author of the upcoming book Kim Jong Un and the Bomb. ""It does create an interesting space for negotiation,"" Panda says.

However, little activity has been seen at North Korea's main space-launch site, according to a recent analysis of commercial satellite imagery by the website 38 North. Moreover, North Korea has, so far, not issued the standard warnings to aircraft and ships that often accompany such a launch.

Underground nuclear test

North Korea's previous nuclear tests have been felt across the world, sending a powerful reminder of the North's nuclear prowess.

Its last test, in 2017, was a thermonuclear whopper. But the following year, North Korea demolished tunnel entrances at its underground test site at Punggye-ri.

Panda says there's no sign of activity at that site, and North Korea is under pressure from neighboring China not to conduct further nuclear tests. ""That said, there is nothing stopping [Kim's government] from constituting another test site,"" he says.

Long-range missile test

""The safe bet is an improved version of one of the missiles that we've already seen,"" Lewis says. ""But the thing that I worry about is a new, much-longer-range, solid-propellant missile.""

Long-range, solid-propellant missiles are an advanced technology that only a few countries possess. They can be launched in a matter of minutes, according to Panda. ""In a crisis, those missiles can be ready much faster than liquid-propellant missiles that have to be fueled,"" he says.

That makes them harder to take out in a preemptive strike.

Panda says there's reason to worry, especially when looking at other shorter-range tests recently conducted by the North. ""Every single missile they've tested in 2019 so far has been a solid-propellant missile,"" he says.

While the exact kind of missile matters to the experts, what matters to everyone else may be whether there's a long-range missile test at all.

The action was taken as President Obama presided over the Security Council session – it was only the second time a US president had done so – and as several US government agencies announced measures they said were complementary to the international action Mr. Obama spearheaded at the UN .
Obama opened the packed meeting saying the resolution aimed to shut down the Islamic State ’ s “ network of death , ” as well as those feeding other terror groups .
Heads of state from each of the council ’ s member countries voted 15 to 0 for the resolution , which asks nations to make it illegal for their citizens to travel to support the hard-line and violent extremist movement , to fund , or to recruit for it . Obama chaired the session , a rare move for an American president .
The measures taken by the US Treasury Department , the State Department , and the Department of Justice aimed to demonstrate two things : the kinds of actions other countries might take to join in the effort to curb foreign terrorist fighters and that the US would match its rhetoric with acts .
The resolution adopted by the 15-member council and co-signed by more than 110 countries animated an hours-long Security Council discussion on the global menace of international terrorism . It was a discussion made all the more poignant by news of the beheading in Algeria of a French citizen , Hervé Gourdel , by Islamist extremists pledging their allegiance to the Islamic State ( IS ) militant organization .
The terrorists , who released a video showing the Frenchman ’ s murder , had said in a video released Sunday that Mr. Gourdel would die , if France did not cease its actions against IS facilities in Iraq .
After casting France ’ s vote in favor of the Security Council resolution , a visibly stricken but determined French President François Hollande told reporters that the day ’ s “ tragedy ” had only reinforced the international community ’ s conviction that “ the battle against terrorism must be carried out everywhere and at all levels . ”
He noted that the Security Council had unanimously condemned the Gourdel killing , which followed the beheadings by IS of two American journalists , James Foley and Steven Sotloff , and British aid worker David Haines .
US officials at the UN who lobbied for the foreign terrorist fighters resolution , including UN Ambassador Samantha Power , emphasized that international terrorism has evolved since the 9/11 attacks engineered by Al Qaeda , and that international counterterrorism efforts had to keep up with and address that evolution .
With international terrorism experts estimating that as many as 30,000 foreign fighters are now in Syria and Iraq , the threat those fighters pose is unprecedented , those experts say .
Not only are the foreign fighters proving to be among the most able and vicious in the fighting in Iraq and Syria , but the threat they pose is compounded by the fact that a good number of them hold Western passports that would facilitate their return to carry out attacks in the US and Europe .
More than 1,000 of the foreign fighters in Syria are estimated to be passport-carrying European citizens , while slightly more than 100 are thought to hold US passports .
But US officials are also keen to emphasize that the battle against foreign fighters is not primarily a Western security concern . Evidence from well over three years of civil war in Syria demonstrates how foreign fighters “ increase the brutality and intractability of conflicts , ” they say .

Like many of Trump 's charges this one does n't hold much water . Clinton left the State Department in January 2013 and ISIS was n't even founded until three months later .
But Trump 's charge does raise an interesting question , which is how best to assign responsibility for the rise of ISIS , including the issue of how might the Obama administration 's exit from Iraq at the end of 2011 have helped smooth the path for ISIS ?
The rise of ISIS starts with a Jordanian thug named Abu Musab al-Zarqawi who founded ISIS ' parent organization , al Qaeda in Iraq .
It was Zarqawi who inaugurated al Qaeda in Iraq 's televised beheadings with the killing of American businessman Nick Berg in 2004 . And it was Zarqawi who ignited a civil war against the Shiites in Iraq the same year . These tactics and policies remain today at the core of ISIS .
What gave Zarqawi the opportunity to create al Qaeda in Iraq ? It was , of course , George W. Bush 's decision to invade Iraq in 2003 . Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein brutally repressed all forms of opposition to his regime and before the Iraq War al Qaeda had no presence in Iraq .
Al Qaeda in Iraq grew in strength in 2006 so that it controlled much of the massive Anbar province in western Iraq . At the beginning of 2007 , Bush authorized a surge of new troops and brought in a new commander , David Petraeus . Allied with a movement of Sunni tribesmen angered by al Qaeda known as `` the Awakening , '' U.S. troops had largely extirpated al Qaeda from Iraq by 2008 .
So how did al Qaeda in Iraq surge back as ISIS ?
There are four big factors . The first is the Syrian civil war , which launched in 2011 in reaction to President Bashar al-Assad 's brutal repression of peaceful protests against his dictatorship . Elements of what would become ISIS traveled from Iraq into Syria to fight against Assad . Those forces gained strength in Syria , which they drew upon when they re-entered Iraq as a reinvigorated force in 2013 , seizing much of Anbar a year later as well as Mosul , the second-largest city in Iraq .
The second factor was the role that some of Hussein 's former officer corps played in helping ISIS to its victories . A number of the late dictator 's former commanders helped to professionalize ISIS as a fighting force . ( The Bush administration 's decision to disband the Iraqi army in 2003 had helped push some Iraqi officers to join Sunni militant groups . )
The third factor was the feckless and incompetent rule of then-Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki , who marginalized Sunnis and disenfranchised them from Iraq 's political process to the point that many Sunnis preferred the rule of the Islamist militants in ISIS to that of the `` Shia '' government in Baghdad . Inexplicably , the Obama White House kept backing Maliki despite his manifest flaws as a leader .
The fourth factor was the hollowing out of the Iraqi army , which simply ran away as ISIS made its most dramatic advances during the first half of 2014 . The Iraqi army was poorly led , poorly paid and riven with corruption .
None of these factors can be easily ascribed to Obama or to Clinton , although certainly they did preside over the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Iraq at the end of 2011 , a plan bequeathed to them by Bush .
Could the Obama administration have fought harder to retain a U.S. troop presence in Iraq ? Possibly .
Would the Iraqi government have allowed such a presence ? Not likely as the Iraq government was by the time of the U.S. withdrawal more aligned with Iran than with the United States .
Obama was also slow to recognize the threat posed by ISIS , famously referring to the Islamist terrorist group gaining ground in Syria and Iraq as a `` JV '' team in a January 2014 interview .
Since the summer of 2014 the Obama administration has mounted -- at least from the air -- an aggressive campaign against ISIS , but it has proven reluctant to do much on the ground .
Could more be done ? Yes . More U.S. Special Forces fighting side by side with Iraqi forces and more U.S. forward air controllers calling in close air support would certainly help the Iraqi military against ISIS .
In Syria , a no-fly zone targeted at Assad 's air force and safe zones for refugees fleeing the fighting would help tamp down the death toll that plays into the hands of ISIS and other Sunni militants who can position themselves as the only groups that are really defending the Sunni population .
Rather than making loose and unsubstantiated claims that Obama and Clinton created ISIS , it would behoove Trump if he advanced some real policy ideas about how to solve the Syrian and Iraqi civil wars . Of course , to do that he would have to get beyond the inflammatory slogans and sound bites that have characterized his campaign .","Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University.

It began with a thug

The rise of ISIS starts with a Jordanian thug named Abu Musab al-Zarqawi who founded ISIS' parent organization, al Qaeda in Iraq.

It was Zarqawi who inaugurated al Qaeda in Iraq's televised beheadings with the killing of American businessman Nick Berg in 2004. And it was Zarqawi who ignited a civil war against the Shiites in Iraq the same year. These tactics and policies remain today at the core of ISIS.

What gave Zarqawi the opportunity to create al Qaeda in Iraq? It was, of course, George W. Bush's decision to invade Iraq in 2003. Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein brutally repressed all forms of opposition to his regime and before the Iraq War al Qaeda had no presence in Iraq.

Al Qaeda in Iraq grew in strength in 2006 so that it controlled much of the massive Anbar province in western Iraq. At the beginning of 2007, Bush authorized a surge of new troops and brought in a new commander, David Petraeus. Allied with a movement of Sunni tribesmen angered by al Qaeda known as ""the Awakening,"" U.S. troops had largely extirpated al Qaeda from Iraq by 2008.

The 4 big factors

So how did al Qaeda in Iraq surge back as ISIS?

There are four big factors. The first is the Syrian civil war, which launched in 2011 in reaction to President Bashar al-Assad's brutal repression of peaceful protests against his dictatorship. Elements of what would become ISIS traveled from Iraq into Syria to fight against Assad. Those forces gained strength in Syria, which they drew upon when they re-entered Iraq as a reinvigorated force in 2013, seizing much of Anbar a year later as well as Mosul, the second-largest city in Iraq.

The second factor was the role that some of Hussein's former officer corps played in helping ISIS to its victories. A number of the late dictator's former commanders helped to professionalize ISIS as a fighting force. (The Bush administration's decision to disband the Iraqi army in 2003 had helped push some Iraqi officers to join Sunni militant groups.)

The third factor was the feckless and incompetent rule of then-Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who marginalized Sunnis and disenfranchised them from Iraq's political process to the point that many Sunnis preferred the rule of the Islamist militants in ISIS to that of the ""Shia"" government in Baghdad. Inexplicably, the Obama White House kept backing Maliki despite his manifest flaws as a leader.

The fourth factor was the hollowing out of the Iraqi army , which simply ran away as ISIS made its most dramatic advances during the first half of 2014. The Iraqi army was poorly led, poorly paid and riven with corruption.

None of these factors can be easily ascribed to Obama or to Clinton, although certainly they did preside over the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Iraq at the end of 2011, a plan bequeathed to them by Bush.

'JV' team?

Could the Obama administration have fought harder to retain a U.S. troop presence in Iraq? Possibly.

Would the Iraqi government have allowed such a presence? Not likely as the Iraq government was by the time of the U.S. withdrawal more aligned with Iran than with the United States.

Obama was also slow to recognize the threat posed by ISIS, famously referring to the Islamist terrorist group gaining ground in Syria and Iraq as a ""JV"" team in a January 2014 interview.

Since the summer of 2014 the Obama administration has mounted -- at least from the air -- an aggressive campaign against ISIS, but it has proven reluctant to do much on the ground.



Could more be done? Yes. More U.S. Special Forces fighting side by side with Iraqi forces and more U.S. forward air controllers calling in close air support would certainly help the Iraqi military against ISIS.

In Syria, a no-fly zone targeted at Assad's air force and safe zones for refugees fleeing the fighting would help tamp down the death toll that plays into the hands of ISIS and other Sunni militants who can position themselves as the only groups that are really defending the Sunni population.

Rather than making loose and unsubstantiated claims that Obama and Clinton created ISIS, it would behoove Trump if he advanced some real policy ideas about how to solve the Syrian and Iraqi civil wars. Of course, to do that he would have to get beyond the inflammatory slogans and sound bites that have characterized his campaign.",www.cnn.com,center,jzWIN6efZYnJXx0w

LETTER FROM HANOI Obama , muted on human rights , lifts arms embargo on Vietnam Standing a block from the corpse of Ho Chi Minh , the president said nothing about democratic reform .
HANOI , Vietnam — With the embalmed body of Communist national forefather Ho Chi Minh lying under lights just a block away in his gray mausoleum , President Barack Obama on Monday signed the dissolution of the nearly 50-year embargo on selling arms to Vietnam , ending one of the last vestiges of the Vietnam War .
But what Obama had to say and do about open democracy here was as sparse as the turnout in polling places here just hours before Air Force One landed — despite , of course , government numbers putting nationwide turnout for the National Assembly elections at 98.77 percent .
Suspicious election results don ’ t usually come together with presidential visits , especially within hours , and especially when the president is arriving with a huge and much desired gift in the form of opening up arms trade .
Hanoi had been pushing Washington for years , as both a point of pride and out of desire for American weapons . The change is potentially huge for American interests , empowering pro-Western forces internally and sending a very charged signal to China , long Vietnam 's regional adversary .
But neither the Americans or the Vietnamese spent any time pretending the change had anything to do with actual democratic reform . Obama didn ’ t make a show of calling for it . President Tran Dai Quang didn ’ t make a show of pretending he was for it . They both knew it would have been a joke .
Obama stood in front of the Vietnamese flag , alongside the Vietnamese president , and the closest he came to criticizing elections in which candidates could be kicked off state-approved lists for offenses such as claims they didn ’ t pay their sanitation fees was saying , “ I made it clear that the United States does not seek to impose our form of government on Vietnam or any nation … at the same time , we will continue to speak out on human rights . ”
But he did n't say whether the U.S. would take human rights violations into account on specific arm sales , though he did pat Vietnam on the back for `` modest progress on some of the areas that we 've identified as a concern '' before pivoting to discussing the benefits of trade .
It sounded a lot like Obama 's general answer on how best to promote human rights : There 's more actual progress to be achieved in the long term by engaging repressive countries and opening their citizens ' eyes to what 's possible than there is from keeping things closed .
And Obama 's relative silence on the matter was not just in public — elections didn ’ t come up in their bilateral meeting just before the news conference either , according to a White House aide .
The president 's arrival for his three-day trip on Vietnamese election day was coincidence , but the kind of coincidence that highlighted a central tension of a trip to a still-closed country like this , where dissidents are thrown in jail and foreign reporters all get state-issued minders . He ’ s here to reward the government for reforms made to get on board with his prized Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal , but those rewards add up to only so much : Just ask the last prime minister , who was replaced by the Communist Party after notable moves toward more engagement .
Certainly don ’ t ask the Vietnamese reporters who covered Obama ’ s joint news conference : more Nerf balls then softballs , their questions appeared to be vetted to the point of Quang having nearly word-for-word answers pre-written in notes on his podium . That ’ s standard fare in Vietnam , which the State Department describes as `` an authoritarian state ruled by a single party . ''
Obama ticked through just about every other type of collaboration — business deals and education partnerships , the Peace Corps starting to come here for the first time , the coordinated efforts to remove land mines , bombs and Agent Orange left over from the Vietnam War .
Then , the main substance of the trip : talking up the TPP and the main “ deliverable ” in government lingo with the lifting of the arms embargo , which Quang said signified that “ both countries have completely normalized relations . ”
“ This change will ensure that Vietnam has access to the equipment it needs to defend itself and removes a lingering vestige of the Cold War , ” Obama said , in terms that mirrored what he said in Cuba on his visit there in February .
Quang , asked by an American reporter about human rights concerns , said that his government and his party see a top responsibility as needing “ to protect and promote human rights . ”
And he said they ’ ve lived up to ensuring the rights of every Vietnamese citizen .
“ Those achievements have been highly recognized and appreciated by the international community , ” Quang said , pointing to Vietnam ’ s coming membership on the United Nations Human Rights Commission as proof . ( Other members of this illustrious group include : Algeria , Cuba , Russia , and Saudi Arabia . )
None of that addressed what happened in the weekend elections , which set the government for the next five years . All across the city , red-and-yellow posters and signs promoted voting , but little activity was evident at over 10 polling places spotted during the day Sunday . Some had busts of Ho Chi Minh looming in the background . Some had men drinking tea and playing games outside . Most had a few soldiers getting comfortable in their plastic chairs . One had a coin-operated children ’ s ride inside .
All of them featured big white boards with approved candidates for those voters who did show up to choose from . This year ’ s elections were more open than previous ones , given that most non-Party candidates weren ’ t arrested or discovered their Facebook pages shut down and there were even protests here and in Ho Chi Minh City . But in the end , none of those people got through , cut off by government technicalities and bureaucratic hold-ups that were used as excuses .
On Tuesday , Obama will deliver a speech to the Vietnamese people and then head south to Ho Chi Minh City for a brief stop that will include meeting with several dissidents as part of a sit-down with local activists and community leaders .
On Monday , Obama didn ’ t really bother . He did what he did and he didn ’ t seem to much care what the Vietnamese had to say about the move . Toward the end of the news conference , as Quang carried on at length in response to a question about his faith in the future of the TPP , Obama ’ s earpiece stopped giving him an English translation .
“ It ’ s just , I ’ m sure he was saying something wise and important , and we wouldn ’ t want to miss it , ” Obama said .
They said they ’ d fixed the problem . They hadn ’ t until after Quang finished , prompting an aide to ask him to give his answer again to allow translation , and when Obama was still getting Vietnamese in his ear , he laughed , shrugged . He wasn ’ t paying much attention , anyway .
But it wasn ’ t a problem for Quang : He just read the same prepared statement over again , and his local news media dutifully took it down .","President Barack Obama on Monday signed the dissolution of the nearly 50-year embargo on selling arms to Vietnam, ending one of the last vestiges of the Vietnam War.

Story Continued Below

Suspicious election results don’t usually come together with presidential visits, especially within hours, and especially when the president is arriving with a huge and much desired gift in the form of opening up arms trade.

Hanoi had been pushing Washington for years, as both a point of pride and out of desire for American weapons. The change is potentially huge for American interests, empowering pro-Western forces internally and sending a very charged signal to China, long Vietnam's regional adversary.

But neither the Americans or the Vietnamese spent any time pretending the change had anything to do with actual democratic reform. Obama didn’t make a show of calling for it. President Tran Dai Quang didn’t make a show of pretending he was for it. They both knew it would have been a joke.

Obama stood in front of the Vietnamese flag, alongside the Vietnamese president, and the closest he came to criticizing elections in which candidates could be kicked off state-approved lists for offenses such as claims they didn’t pay their sanitation fees was saying, “I made it clear that the United States does not seek to impose our form of government on Vietnam or any nation … at the same time, we will continue to speak out on human rights.”

But he didn't say whether the U.S. would take human rights violations into account on specific arm sales, though he did pat Vietnam on the back for ""modest progress on some of the areas that we've identified as a concern"" before pivoting to discussing the benefits of trade.

It sounded a lot like Obama's general answer on how best to promote human rights: There's more actual progress to be achieved in the long term by engaging repressive countries and opening their citizens' eyes to what's possible than there is from keeping things closed.

And Obama's relative silence on the matter was not just in public — elections didn’t come up in their bilateral meeting just before the news conference either, according to a White House aide.

The president's arrival for his three-day trip on Vietnamese election day was coincidence, but the kind of coincidence that highlighted a central tension of a trip to a still-closed country like this, where dissidents are thrown in jail and foreign reporters all get state-issued minders. He’s here to reward the government for reforms made to get on board with his prized Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, but those rewards add up to only so much: Just ask the last prime minister, who was replaced by the Communist Party after notable moves toward more engagement.

Certainly don’t ask the Vietnamese reporters who covered Obama’s joint news conference: more Nerf balls then softballs, their questions appeared to be vetted to the point of Quang having nearly word-for-word answers pre-written in notes on his podium. That’s standard fare in Vietnam, which the State Department describes as ""an authoritarian state ruled by a single party.""

Obama ticked through just about every other type of collaboration — business deals and education partnerships, the Peace Corps starting to come here for the first time, the coordinated efforts to remove land mines, bombs and Agent Orange left over from the Vietnam War.

Then, the main substance of the trip: talking up the TPP and the main “deliverable” in government lingo with the lifting of the arms embargo, which Quang said signified that “both countries have completely normalized relations.”

“This change will ensure that Vietnam has access to the equipment it needs to defend itself and removes a lingering vestige of the Cold War,” Obama said, in terms that mirrored what he said in Cuba on his visit there in February.

Quang, asked by an American reporter about human rights concerns, said that his government and his party see a top responsibility as needing “to protect and promote human rights.”

And he said they’ve lived up to ensuring the rights of every Vietnamese citizen.

“Those achievements have been highly recognized and appreciated by the international community,” Quang said, pointing to Vietnam’s coming membership on the United Nations Human Rights Commission as proof. (Other members of this illustrious group include: Algeria, Cuba, Russia, and Saudi Arabia.)

None of that addressed what happened in the weekend elections, which set the government for the next five years. All across the city, red-and-yellow posters and signs promoted voting, but little activity was evident at over 10 polling places spotted during the day Sunday. Some had busts of Ho Chi Minh looming in the background. Some had men drinking tea and playing games outside. Most had a few soldiers getting comfortable in their plastic chairs. One had a coin-operated children’s ride inside.

All of them featured big white boards with approved candidates for those voters who did show up to choose from. This year’s elections were more open than previous ones, given that most non-Party candidates weren’t arrested or discovered their Facebook pages shut down and there were even protests here and in Ho Chi Minh City. But in the end, none of those people got through, cut off by government technicalities and bureaucratic hold-ups that were used as excuses.

On Tuesday, Obama will deliver a speech to the Vietnamese people and then head south to Ho Chi Minh City for a brief stop that will include meeting with several dissidents as part of a sit-down with local activists and community leaders.

On Monday, Obama didn’t really bother. He did what he did and he didn’t seem to much care what the Vietnamese had to say about the move. Toward the end of the news conference, as Quang carried on at length in response to a question about his faith in the future of the TPP, Obama’s earpiece stopped giving him an English translation.

He asked for help. Vietnamese aides started scurrying.

“It’s just, I’m sure he was saying something wise and important, and we wouldn’t want to miss it,” Obama said.

They said they’d fixed the problem. They hadn’t until after Quang finished, prompting an aide to ask him to give his answer again to allow translation, and when Obama was still getting Vietnamese in his ear, he laughed, shrugged. He wasn’t paying much attention, anyway.

But it wasn’t a problem for Quang: He just read the same prepared statement over again, and his local news media dutifully took it down.",www.politico.com,left,M30xdJxIUvrnLUzE
