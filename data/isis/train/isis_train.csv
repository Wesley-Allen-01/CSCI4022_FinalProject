Mcfarland,"President Obama has laid out his plan for defeating ISIS in the Middle East . It was a strong sounding speech on Wednesday night , well argued and touched all the right points . But it had two glaring shortcomings : there was nothing about homeland defense , and there was no mention of Plan B , if Plan A fails .
Maybe the president does have a plan for a beefed up homeland defense in light of the new ISIS threat , and just hasn ’ t told us about it .
Maybe he thinks it ’ s self-evident that if we destroy ISIS in the Middle East , we will have nothing to fear in the Middle West . But British Prime Minister David Cameron was concerned enough about the threat posed by ISIS that he outlined significant steps he would take to protect the British homeland .
President Obama should do the same . The American people are nervous ; half of us feel less safe now than at any time since the original September 11th attacks .
President Obama ’ s Plan A strategy for dealing with ISIS is , in effect , a new Iraq War . It ’ s America ’ s third Iraq War in a generation , and it will :
- Last a long time -- well past Obama ’ s term in office .
- Depend on an as yet unformed , inclusive Iraqi government , working with an as yet unassembled coalition of countries in the region that may or may not include military forces of Saudi Arabia , Iran and an as yet unidentified friendly Syrian rebels .
- Aim to ‘ degrade and defeat ISIL ’ - a rather vague goal which we presumably will recognize once we ’ ve achieved it .
The president won ’ t call it a war , even though we will be bombing ISIS in Iraq and Syria , and despite the fact that we have an open-ended commitment to put an as yet uncertain number of US ( non-combat ) boots on the ground to help the new Iraq government and the anti-ISIS coalition . And , since the president doesn ’ t call it a war , he wo n't feel the need to seek permission from Congress .

It was a strong sounding speech on Wednesday night, well argued and touched all the right points. But it had two glaring shortcomings: there was nothing about homeland defense, and there was no mention of Plan B, if Plan A fails.

Maybe the president does have a plan for a beefed up homeland defense in light of the new ISIS threat, and just hasn’t told us about it.

Maybe he thinks it’s self-evident that if we destroy ISIS in the Middle East, we will have nothing to fear in the Middle West. But British Prime Minister David Cameron was concerned enough about the threat posed by ISIS that he outlined significant steps he would take to protect the British homeland.

President Obama should do the same. The American people are nervous; half of us feel less safe now than at any time since the original September 11th attacks.

President Obama’s Plan A strategy for dealing with ISIS is, in effect, a new Iraq War. It’s America’s third Iraq War in a generation, and it will:



- Last a long time -- well past Obama’s term in office.

- Depend on an as yet unformed, inclusive Iraqi government, working with an as yet unassembled coalition of countries in the region that may or may not include military forces of Saudi Arabia, Iran and an as yet unidentified friendly Syrian rebels.

- Aim to ‘degrade and defeat ISIL’ - a rather vague goal which we presumably will recognize once we’ve achieved it.

The president won’t call it a war, even though we will be bombing ISIS in Iraq and Syria, and despite the fact that we have an open-ended commitment to put an as yet uncertain number of US (non-combat) boots on the ground to help the new Iraq government and the anti-ISIS coalition. And, since the president doesn’t call it a war, he won't feel the need to seek permission from Congress.



None of this fills me with confidence. It sounds like a plan with a lot of moving parts all of which have to work perfectly in order for the plan to succeed.

It also sounds like a plan the president has arrived at reluctantly, and hopes to carry it out with the bare minimum of force, thus lessening his political risk but putting our forces at considerable risk.



I’m not against this plan. In fact, I agree with Vice President Biden that we should chase ISIS back to the Gates of Hell. I just don’t think the president’s plan is likely to succeed.

I’m a hawk, and don’t shy away from using America’s military might to protect our vital national interests. But I don’t believe in fighting wars half-heartedly. If we’re in it, we should be in it to win it, whatever it takes. If we’re not willing to do that, we shouldn’t begin.



No president should take his people to war unless he believes his cause is just, and his efforts will succeed. No president should take his people to war just because he doesn’t know what else to do, or because it will give him a boost in the polls.

Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey made the remarks to reporters while traveling to Paris to meet with his French counterpart to discuss the situation in Iraq and Syria . The general said that U.S. assessors who had spent the summer observing Iraq 's security forces concluded that 26 of the army 's 50 brigades would be capable of confronting the Islamic State , also known as ISIS . Dempsey described those brigades as well-led , capable , and endowed with a nationalist instinct , as opposed to a sectarian instinct .
However , Dempsey said that the other 24 brigades were too heavily populated with Shiites to be part of a credible force against the Sunni ISIS .
Sectarianism has been a major problem for the Iraqi security forces for years and is in part a reflection of resentments that built up during the decades of rule under Saddam Hussein , who repressed the majority Shiite population , and the unleashing of reprisals against Sunnis after U.S. forces toppled him in April 2003 . Sunni resistance led to the relatively brief rise of an extremist group called Al Qaeda in Iraq , led by the late Abu Musab al-Zarqawi . That group withered but re-emerged as the Islamic State organization , which capitalized on Sunni disenchantment with the Shiite government in Baghdad .
On Tuesday , Dempsey told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he would consider recommending the return of ground forces to Iraq if an international coalition sought by the Obama administration proves ineffective .
On Wednesday , Dempsey said no amount of U.S. military power would solve the problem of ISIS 's takeover of large swaths of northern and western Iraq .

President Obama is to be briefed on the planned campaign against ISIS Wednesday in Tampa , Florida , when he meets with Gen. Lloyd Austin , head of U.S. Central Command , which manages U.S. military operations and relations across the Middle East .","The U.S. military's top officer said Wednesday that almost half of Iraq's army is incapable of working against the Islamic State militant group, while the other half needs to be rebuilt with the help of U.S. advisers and military equipment.

Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey made the remarks to reporters while traveling to Paris to meet with his French counterpart to discuss the situation in Iraq and Syria. The general said that U.S. assessors who had spent the summer observing Iraq's security forces concluded that 26 of the army's 50 brigades would be capable of confronting the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. Dempsey described those brigades as well-led, capable, and endowed with a nationalist instinct, as opposed to a sectarian instinct.

However, Dempsey said that the other 24 brigades were too heavily populated with Shiites to be part of a credible force against the Sunni ISIS.

Sectarianism has been a major problem for the Iraqi security forces for years and is in part a reflection of resentments that built up during the decades of rule under Saddam Hussein, who repressed the majority Shiite population, and the unleashing of reprisals against Sunnis after U.S. forces toppled him in April 2003. Sunni resistance led to the relatively brief rise of an extremist group called Al Qaeda in Iraq, led by the late Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. That group withered but re-emerged as the Islamic State organization, which capitalized on Sunni disenchantment with the Shiite government in Baghdad.

On Tuesday, Dempsey told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he would consider recommending the return of ground forces to Iraq if an international coalition sought by the Obama administration proves ineffective.

On Wednesday, Dempsey said no amount of U.S. military power would solve the problem of ISIS's takeover of large swaths of northern and western Iraq. The solution, he said, must begin with formation of an Iraqi government that is able to convince the country's Kurdish and Sunni populations that they will be equal partners with the Shiites in Iraq's future.

""I'm telling you, if that doesn't happen then it's time for Plan B,"" he said. He didn't say what that would entail.

Dempsey also said that ISIS fighters in Iraq have reacted to weeks of U.S. airstrikes by making themselves less visible, and he predicted they would ""literally litter the road networks"" with improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, in the days ahead. That, in turn, will require more counter-IED training and equipment for the Iraq army, he said.

According to the general, a renewed U.S. training effort might revive the issue of gaining legal immunity from Iraqi prosecution for those U.S. troops who are training the Iraqis. The previous Iraqi government refused to grant immunity for U.S. troops who might have remained as trainers after the U.S. military mission ended in December 2011.

""There will likely be a discussion with the new Iraqi government, as there was with the last one, about whether we need to have"" Iraqi lawmakers approve new U.S. training, he said. He didn't describe the full extent of such training but said it would be limited and he believed Iraq would endorse it.

""This is about training them in protected locations and then enabling them"" with unique U.S. capabilities such as intelligence, aerial surveillance and air power, as well as U.S. advisers, so they can ""fight the fight"" required to push the Islamic State militants back into Syria, Dempsey said.

A Pentagon plan for training Syrian rebels is another, more controversial element of the plan, which also includes potential airstrikes in Syria; building an international coalition to combat the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq; and efforts to cut off finances and stem the flow of foreign fighters to the Islamic State group.

President Obama is to be briefed on the planned campaign against ISIS Wednesday in Tampa, Florida, when he meets with Gen. Lloyd Austin, head of U.S. Central Command, which manages U.S. military operations and relations across the Middle East.

`` There is no such thing as a no-risk strategy , '' said Rep. Adam Smith , D-Washington . `` It 's a matter of taking the right risk and balancing that risk to make the right choice . ''
Here 's a look at some possibilities , including why and how they could and could not work :
When terrorists attacked on September 11 , 2001 , the United States showed its willingness to use its full military might when it attacked Afghanistan -- a campaign that dragged on for years and killed more than 2,300 American troops .
That steep cost , both human and financial , is the big reason this is very , very unlikely to happen again in Syria .
No U.S. officials have suggested troops on the ground . The fact none were sent to fight in Iraq -- a country where the U.S. has deeper ties and a government it works with -- is further indication there will be no U.S. ground invasion of Syria anytime soon .
There could be smaller-scale , targeted operations , though . After all , Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby told CNN that , this summer , elite U.S. commandos from units like Delta Force and Navy SEAL Team 6 went into Syria and tried to rescue American journalist James Foley and others held by Islamic militants .
They did n't find hostages , but who 's to say U.S. Special Operations Forces could n't conduct more such missions to save others or for some other purpose ? Then there 's the possibility American troops could go into Syria to help with the targeting of U.S. airstrikes .
Of course , all bets are off if ISIS pulls an al Qaeda and strikes inside the United States .
That has n't happened yet , though some experts believe that such an attack from ISIS -- which , upon beheading Foley , warned other U.S. citizens could be next -- might be a matter of time .
Obama gave the go-ahead to pound ISIS forces in Iraq from the air . Why not do the same in Syria , a country the President himself ceded Thursday has become a `` safe haven '' for the terror group ?
It starts with the fact that Syria is a mess . Three years of civil war have torn apart the country , spurring the emergence of rebel groups fighting to oust President Bashar al-Assad and sometimes against each other . About the only thing al-Assad and rebel groups have in common is that ISIS is their enemy .
Obama is pushing to get al-Assad too , but they 're on the same side when it comes to ISIS . Yet U.S. officials insist this shared cause does n't mean they 'll coordinate any military action with al-Assad 's government , even if Syrian officials are demanding it .
It 's one thing to anger Syria even more . It 's another thing to anger its allies Iran and Russia . Russia , which is already at odds with the West over Ukraine , could block any U.N. Security Council effort to give a seal of approval to international strikes .
All of this brings many questions : Does the United States really want to conduct a military campaign in a country without a government that is stable and that it trusts ? Can it count on opposition factions it supports to provide any long-term stability ? And does it know that airstrikes will wipe out ISIS in Syria rather than stalling the group ?
Absent a fortune-teller , it 's hard to tell how any military action would turn out .

Still , if Obama decides that 's the way to go now , White House spokesman Josh Earnest stressed , more needs to be done politically , diplomatically and economically long-term to keep ISIS down .
`` Any sort of strategy that 's predicated only on the use of American military force will not be an enduring solution , '' he said .
The Obama administration frequently touts its support for `` moderate opposition '' battling both al-Assad 's forces and ISIS . Yet , for all its talk , it has n't directly armed such forces .
The ideal is , if you arm groups like the Free Syrian Army , they can help take out ISIS .
That may not be realistic , considering ISIS with the Syrian government may be the most powerful forces now in the nation . Then there 's the real possibility that if moderate forces lose , American weaponry may end up in the hands of ISIS , as has happened in Iraq .
Still , it helps to have someone local you trust to provide on-the-ground intelligence for airstrikes or compliment those strikes with a ground assault .
Smith , the Democrats ' ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee , is among those who believes `` U.S. military might alone is not going to contain ISIS . We are going to need partners locally . ''
`` We have to strengthen them , not so much so they can win , '' Smith said of the Free Syria movement , `` but so that they can survive and maintain some territory to give us a partner to work with . ''
If you ca n't pound ISIS into submission militarily , the reasoning goes , you can hit it where it hurts : the wallet .
The thinking goes that , in order to wage war , you need weapons , vehicles , ammunition . In order to govern a country , you need access to food , water and electricity . And usually to address these needs , a group needs money .
Implementing sanctions and freezing bank accounts are often the first , least controversial steps to go after a terrorist group . And they can have an impact , but they also have their limits .
For one , one should n't think such efforts will be effective overnight . They take time to coordinate , and it takes time to drain militants ' piggy banks . Plus , it 's not like there 's a readily available list of ISIS donors to go after .
And the fact is , ISIS is n't like many other terror groups . Unlike others like al Qaeda , it 's chief goal is as practical as it is ideological : to take over and govern territory .
Already , ISIS has proven adept at seizing weaponry . It 's also paid attention to things like food stocks , electricity , sewage , medical care and more , as a recent Foreign Policy article noted .

`` They are in this for the long haul , '' Rep. Mike Rogers , R-Michigan , said . `` They are trying to structure themselves in a way that they can hold and expand their holdings . ''
Whether its government is effective or not , one thing ISIS has proven is its zealousness for the cause and willingness to sacrifice civilians who have n't believed in it from the beginning .
One big thing the United States has going for it : Practically no one likes ISIS .
Sure , there are groups and individuals backing the formation of an Islamic State -- which is what ISIS calls itself now that it controls a vast swath of Syria and Iraq -- governed by sharia law . Some from oil-rich Muslim states in the Middle East may bankroll the group ; others fight , with U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder this summer estimating that there are 7,000 such foreigners with militant groups in Syria .
`` There are clearly two camps in the world today : those who believe that sovereignty and supremacy in the world belongs to God , they are the Islamic State , ( and ) those who believe sovereignty belongs to man , '' said British firebrand preacher Anjem Choudhary , who sides with the Islamic State .
Yet ISIS has far , far more detractors than supporters . It has a bloody track record of beheadings , crucifixions , stonings , not to mention the widespread slaughtering of minorities , Christians and Muslims who do n't prescribe to its strict interpretation of Islam .
Such actions -- like Foley 's execution -- spurred widespread condemnation . Some have incentive to go beyond condemnation and act , militarily , against ISIS .
Start with nations that border Syria , like Jordan and Turkey . As its self-ordained caliphate shows , ISIS has shown that it does n't abide by national borders . What 's to stop it from advancing into another country , especially if it gets bigger , stronger and richer ? That possibility might spur other countries , besides the United States , to step in sooner rather than later .
Even if they do n't neighbor Iraq or Syria , nations with significant populations of Sunnis -- which is the sect of most Muslims worldwide , including in Middle Eastern nations like Saudi Arabia and Egypt -- may have reason to worry . Like with al Qaeda previously , disaffected young Muslims anywhere -- even in the West -- could join ISIS , then perhaps deciding to act out in their homelands .
`` It 's certainly not in the interest of governments in that neighborhood to have ( ISIS ) wreaking havoc or perpetrating terrible acts of violence , '' said Earnest , the White House spokesman .
These nations could band together . The United States could be part of this coalition , perhaps letting others take an equal or greater role in military operations .
The idea of Washington leading `` from behind '' has precedent : look at Libya . This international coalition got what it wanted with the downfall of dictator Moammar Gadhafi . But years later , Libya is not a model of anything good : beset by warring militias and without an effective central government .
Rogers , the House Intelligence committee chairman , thinks the Obama administration has had `` no real strategy '' on ISIS so far -- especially a strategy that addresses the group 's base in Syria -- even though the group 's been growing stronger for years .
`` We 're so far along into this , '' the Republican said of ISIS 's rise . `` It 's not like this happened just last week . ''","Story highlights Obama: U.S. has no military strategy yet on what to do against ISIS in Syria

If the United States is serious about thoroughly defeating ISIS, it must -- somehow, some way -- go through Syria.

But how? And in what way?

Those are the big questions now, as President Barack Obama weighs what to do inside the war-ravaged nation where ISIS leaders are based and where the Islamist terror group rose to prominence.

Here's a look at some possibilities, including why and how they could and could not work:

1) Ground forces

In other words, go all in.

When terrorists attacked on September 11, 2001, the United States showed its willingness to use its full military might when it attacked Afghanistan -- a campaign that dragged on for years and killed more than 2,300 American troops.

That steep cost, both human and financial, is the big reason this is very, very unlikely to happen again in Syria.

That hasn't happened yet, though some experts believe that such an attack from ISIS -- which, upon beheading Foley, warned other U.S. citizens could be next -- might be a matter of time.

2) Airstrikes

Obama gave the go-ahead to pound ISIS forces in Iraq from the air. Why not do the same in Syria, a country the President himself ceded Thursday has become a ""safe haven"" for the terror group?

Except it's not that simple.

It starts with the fact that Syria is a mess. Three years of civil war have torn apart the country, spurring the emergence of rebel groups fighting to oust President Bashar al-Assad and sometimes against each other. About the only thing al-Assad and rebel groups have in common is that ISIS is their enemy.

3) Support factions in Syria to fight ISIS

The Obama administration frequently touts its support for ""moderate opposition"" battling both al-Assad's forces and ISIS. Yet, for all its talk, it hasn't directly armed such forces.

The ideal is, if you arm groups like the Free Syrian Army, they can help take out ISIS.

""We have to strengthen them, not so much so they can win,"" Smith said of the Free Syria movement, ""but so that they can survive and maintain some territory to give us a partner to work with.""

4) Cut off ISIS's funding

If you can't pound ISIS into submission militarily, the reasoning goes, you can hit it where it hurts: the wallet.

The thinking goes that, in order to wage war, you need weapons, vehicles, ammunition. In order to govern a country, you need access to food, water and electricity. And usually to address these needs, a group needs money.

5) Build a true international coalition

One big thing the United States has going for it: Practically no one likes ISIS.

Sure, there are groups and individuals backing the formation of an Islamic State -- which is what ISIS calls itself now that it controls a vast swath of Syria and Iraq -- governed by sharia law. Some from oil-rich Muslim states in the Middle East may bankroll the group; others fight, with U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder this summer estimating that there are 7,000 such foreigners with militant groups in Syria.

Idlib , the last rebel stronghold in Syria , has witnessed increased violence and bloodshed since last December , the start of a Russia-backed Syrian offensive to regain control over the region .
`` At 00.01 tonight , as in , from midnight , the ceasefire will be put in place , '' Erdogan told reporters on Thursday in the Russian capital .
Erdogan added that Turkey , which has sent thousands of troops into Idlib to repel the Syrian army , would not `` remain silent '' if Syrian government forces continued attacks and warned that Ankara would retaliate with full force .
Putin said Russia did not always agree with its Turkish partners but hoped the deal will serve as a `` good basis for ending the fighting in the Idlib de-escalation zone , put an end to [ the ] suffering of [ the ] civilian population and contain a growing humanitarian crisis . ''
Even as the ceasefire came into effect , Turkey 's state-owned Anadolu news agency reported early on Friday that Turkish forces killed 21 Syrian troops and destroyed two artillery pieces and two missile launchers , in retaliation of the killing of two Turkish soldiers in Idlib earlier on Thursday .
Since last December , more than 300 civilians , including at least 100 children , have been killed in Idlib .
Nearly one million people have been internally displaced to the border with Turkey , most of them forced to camp out in the open - the worst humanitarian crisis in Syria 's nine-year-old civil war , according to the United Nations .
Erdogan on Thursday said the two leaders agreed to help these refugees return to their homes .
Turkey and Russia on Thursday also agreed to establish a secure corridor along a key east-west highway in Syria 's Idlib and hold joint patrols on it as of March 15 .
In a joint statement read out by the Turkish and Russian foreign ministers , the two sides said the secure corridor would stretch 6km ( 3.7 miles ) to the north and 6km to the south of the M4 highway .

Until the latest crisis , Putin and Erdogan had managed to coordinate their interests in Syria even though Moscow backed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad , while Ankara supported the opposition forces .
Earlier on Thursday , al-Assad accused Turkey 's president of `` supporting terrorists '' .
`` Erdogan is unable to tell the Turks why he is sending his army to fight in Syria and why his soldiers are being killed there because the issue has nothing to do with Turkish interests but with his Muslim Brotherhood ideology , '' he told the state-owned Russia 24 channel .
The Idlib crisis marks the first time Ankara has launched a direct offensive against al-Assad 's forces .
███ 's Hashem Ahelbarra , reporting from Hatay on the Turkish-Syrian border , said Erdogan managed to get some `` huge concessions '' in the talks with Putin .
`` I think this is going to be seen as a massive victory for Erdogan , '' Ahelbarra said . They got the ceasefire plus the safe corridors and also resettlement of the civilians back into their areas .
`` Erdogan wo n't have to be concerned about his soldiers . Also , Turkey has been very concerned about a protracted conflict in Idlib that would pave the way for four million civilians to cross into Turkey . I think now those are some of the people that will be able to go back to their villages . ''
After dozens of his troops were killed in Syria , Erdogan has threatened Europe with a fresh migratory crisis by allowing refugees to travel on to Europe from Turkey , which he said can no longer handle new waves of people fleeing war-torn Syria .
On Thursday , Putin offered his condolences to Erdogan over Turkish losses in a Syrian air attack but noted there were also deaths among Syrian forces .
The two Turkish soldiers who were killed in an attack in Idlib on Thursday raised the number of Turkish soldiers killed since the beginning of February to 60 .
After Turkey downed several Syrian jets , Moscow warned Ankara its aircraft would be unsafe if they enter Syrian airspace - a veiled threat to engage Russian military assets in Syria .
Fighting continued on Thursday in Idlib during the talks in Russia . Opposition activists there blamed Russian aircraft for an attack on a rebel-held village , which they said killed at least 15 people , including children , and wounded several others .
The Russian military had no immediate comment on the claim , but it has staunchly denied similar previous claims , insisting it has not singled out residential areas .

With reporting by Linah Alsaafin in Antakya and Julian Colling in Moscow .","Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have announced a military ceasefire in Idlib, after a meeting in Moscow that lasted six hours.

Idlib, the last rebel stronghold in Syria, has witnessed increased violence and bloodshed since last December, the start of a Russia-backed Syrian offensive to regain control over the region.

More:

""At 00.01 tonight, as in, from midnight, the ceasefire will be put in place,"" Erdogan told reporters on Thursday in the Russian capital.

Erdogan added that Turkey, which has sent thousands of troops into Idlib to repel the Syrian army, would not ""remain silent"" if Syrian government forces continued attacks and warned that Ankara would retaliate with full force.

Putin said Russia did not always agree with its Turkish partners but hoped the deal will serve as a ""good basis for ending the fighting in the Idlib de-escalation zone, put an end to [the] suffering of [the] civilian population and contain a growing humanitarian crisis.""

Even as the ceasefire came into effect, Turkey's state-owned Anadolu news agency reported early on Friday that Turkish forces killed 21 Syrian troops and destroyed two artillery pieces and two missile launchers, in retaliation of the killing of two Turkish soldiers in Idlib earlier on Thursday.

Since last December, more than 300 civilians, including at least 100 children, have been killed in Idlib.

Nearly one million people have been internally displaced to the border with Turkey, most of them forced to camp out in the open - the worst humanitarian crisis in Syria's nine-year-old civil war, according to the United Nations.

Erdogan on Thursday said the two leaders agreed to help these refugees return to their homes.

Turkey and Russia on Thursday also agreed to establish a secure corridor along a key east-west highway in Syria's Idlib and hold joint patrols on it as of March 15.

They said their defence ministers would agree on the parameters of the corridor within a week.

In the aftermath of the murder of James Foley by the international terrorist group the Islamic State, much has been made of the “bad optics” surrounding President Obama’s rush to the golf course after his comments on the videotaped beheading of the American journalist. Even The New York Times chimed in with a story addressing “The Terrorist Horror, Then Golf ” resulting in an analysis that eviscerates the president for his perceived indifference.

The tone of that article, and so many others, seem to reflect genuine surprise at what appears to be ice water in the president’s veins. For some of us, however, Mr. Obama’s indifference to the plight of individuals other than himself has been apparent for quite some time.

That’s right, a criminal prosecution. This shouldn’t surprise anyone. Mr. Obama declared to the United Nations in 2011 that the “tide of war is receding,” and he’s going to continue to pretend that’s the case. (You see, if he treats acts of war as though they’re individual crimes, voila, no more war.)

What to do, however, when the world doesn’t cooperate? The only way to maintain the lie is to change the vocabulary; ergo, when an American gets his head chopped off by a terrorist nation — a declaration of war — the United States instead opens up a “criminal investigation.” Because it can never, ever be about war waged against the United States.

Why? Because it puts the lie to the liberal narrative: Mr. Obama stopped war, saved the world, rolled back the tide of evil and nihilistic violence. Because America has been neutered. And because of unicorns.

It 's not the solution
Matthew Hoh is a former Marine who served two tours in Iraq before being stationed in Afghanistan as a high-ranking foreign service officer . In 2009 , Hoh resigned in protest from the State Department over the U.S. ' misguided occupation of Afghanistan .
You 've written that sending U.S. troops back into Iraq , bombing the Islamic State , or otherwise engaging militarily in Iraq 's civil war may serve to salve guilty American consciences , but will only exacerbate the country 's violent divisions in the long run . With that said , there remain thousands of Yazidi and other non-Sunni refugees stranded and besieged on a mountain , with no access to food and water other than by airlift , dying of starvation , dehydration and sunstroke .
Should it prove to be the case that the deployment of U.S. ground troops is the only means available to carry out an evacuation , is there a valid distinction to be made between that kind of an emergency , humanitarian rescue mission and out-and-out U.S. military intervention in Iraq ? Could this be a situation in which some limited use of U.S. military force in the area is justified , and if not , what is the humanitarian alternative ?
I think that distinction can be made in theory or in debate , but in practice I do n't believe it is possible to put American troops into the middle of the Iraq civil war without supporting one side against another in the conflict . If our troops go into Iraq they will be picking winners and losers in a society they do not understand and in a war that is amazingly complex . This was the genesis of this conflict in 2003 . The United States has quite a history of U.S. forces being utilized by one side against another in foreign civil wars , and that utilization only widens and deepens the conflict . Vietnam , Afghanistan , Libya , Yemen and , of course , our nearly nine-year-long occupation of Iraq are all examples . Further , putting foreign troops into Iraq will only help serve the interests of ISIS by lending credence to their propaganda and recruiting narratives .
The plight of the Yazidis should not be seen either as a singular tragic event , but rather as the most recent of a vicious cycle of violence that has been ongoing in Iraq . Estimates are of half a million dead , millions injured or maimed , and upwards of 4 million people , out of a population of 32 million , or one in eight , have been forcibly driven from their homes since 2003 . So , without some political solution that will stop the cycle of violence , the Yazidis will soon be replaced in the archives of Iraqi horrors by another ethnicity or demographic . A long-term solution is what is needed , not something that is short-term and designed to score domestic political points or adhere to some form of foreign policy ideology or doctrine .
Finally , it is very important to separate and not conflate our humanitarian mission with the military mission . The United States is the wealthiest nation on Earth and we should help in a humanitarian manner whenever we can . However , in this case our military assets were not used to protect the Yazidis , but to protect territory that the Kurds have taken control of over the last two months . Since June the Kurds have increased their territory by 40 percent , including capturing the major oil city of Kirkuk . Northern Iraq is rich with oil and natural gas and what is playing out is a battle for these resources by the Kurds and Sunnis in the wake of the departure of Baghdad 's control and army . In effect we have become the Kurdish Air Force in protecting the gains the Kurds have made since this crisis began in June . Additionally , we have a very large CIA base near Erbil , which was reported by the Miami Herald last month , and protection of that , because of our concerns with Iran , is a priority for the administration .
The same was said , however , by Clinton administration officials about Rwanda — that the U.S. can not risk American lives , treasure and prestige intervening in a `` tribal '' conflict that could embroil the U.S. in the region for years or decades . The result of that calculation was genocide . Is the situation different in this case ? What should be the guidelines for when foreign troops should intervene to prevent genocide or a level of mass atrocity that approaches it ?
I 'll turn this around and say that I think the situation is different because of the oil and natural gas in northern Iraq . If Rwanda had such resources I think you would have seen intervention by the U.S. in the '90s .
Additionally this situation is different , because it has been caused by U.S./Western occupation in Iraq and the resultant destabilization of the region . ISIS is an outgrowth of al-Qaida in Iraq , which was created in the wake of our invasion of Iraq in 2003 . What needs to be done is to reverse the cycle of instability caused by U.S. intervention and meddling , one of the results of which is the atrocity committed against the Yazidis .
Consistency in our policy is a needed start to diminish the chances of future genocide . Remember a year ago , many of the same advocates in the U.S. of our reentry into the Iraqi civil war to fight ISIS were advocating the U.S. become involved militarily in Syria , which , in effect , would have put the U.S. in support of ISIS and its goals in Syria . So , consistency in policy , and some thinking other than military-only approaches , needs to be applied to the region .
As far as what guidelines should be for U.S. troop intervention , I must say I do not know . I have not seen any evidence of successful U.S. intervention to stop such violence in our modern history . So , while I think it is a noble idea , I do n't think it is practically possible . Prevention of genocide by addressing conditions of political instability and lack of political order is what is needed and what is attainable .
Certainly the U.S. invasion unleashed the chaos we 're witnessing and set in motion the events that led to the rise of al-Qaida in Iraq/ISIS/the Islamic State . However , it was during the period of U.S. drawdown that Nouri Al-Maliki consolidated Shiite political rule and excluded the Sunnis from power , fueling the disenchantment that has led to this resurgence of militant Sunni nationalism . While the U.S. was exiting its military role in Iraq , are there diplomatic levers the Obama administration could have used to prevent the current outcome we 're seeing ? Are there diplomatic levers it could still use today ? Or should the U.S. simply extricate itself from the conflict on every level , both military and non-military ?
I think we need to remain engaged with the world and the Middle East non-militarily while steadily reducing our military engagement , and thereby drawing down tensions in the Middle East , cooling off the arms race amongst Middle Eastern nations , particularly Iran and Saudi Arabia , and diminishing the rationale and narrative of terror groups like al-Qaida and ISIS , that rely , in simple terms , on keeping the motif of the Crusades alive . We have had a heavy military involvement , indeed a military-first foreign policy , in the Middle East since the end of World War II and most especially over the last four decades . The result has been a steadily decreasing level of stability in the region .
With Iraq we should have limited our arms sales to the Maliki government and limited its oil exports unless the government had remained politically inclusive . We have also fostered incredible confrontation between Saudi Arabia and Iran , aggravating an existing Sunni Arab and Shia Persian tension that has played out in both nations supporting proxies in the civil war in Iraq . Of course , this may not have been possible ; we may not have had such leverage in Iraq following our occupation . Both Shia and Sunni Iraqi communities were devastated as a result of the American occupation , so it is debatable what influence we could have had at all in Iraq over the last three years .
I feel , sadly , the violence in Iraq may need to play out , that external involvement will cause unintended consequences in Iraq and the region . The United States ' focus needs to be on repairing , actually completely rebuilding , any moral authority it once possessed and trying to become a truly independent outside power that seeks stability , balance of power and prosperity for the people of the Middle East . This is n't fanciful idealism , but rather realistic policy necessary to prevent further atrocity and collapse throughout the Middle East . If the U.S. continues to try and pick winners and losers in the Middle East then the U.S. , and the Middle East , will continue to fail .
Do you believe that the most stable eventual outcome for Iraqis may be the partition of Iraq into three countries , for Shiites , Sunnis and Kurds , respectively , if it 's even possible to do so without foreign intervention ?
Yes , I do . I think that is the solution . There must be an equitable sharing of resources , but I believe that is the path most conducive to stability . Over time , when political order is restored , I think you will see a return to the multi-ethnicity that did characterize large parts of Iraq , including Baghdad , but for now I think only segregation and equitable sharing of resources will provide a solution to stop the cycle of violence .
At this particular moment , do you hold out much hope for the long-term future of Iraq ?
No . I think political order in Iraq has been so overturned and upset , that we are going to see a lot more bloodshed until a natural and legitimate political order exists again . Again , to reiterate , the cause of this chaos and death has been outside intervention and occupation by foreign forces . It is mind-boggling that people advocate that as the solution .","Center for International Policy ""I have not seen any evidence of successful U.S. intervention to stop such violence in our modern history"" Ex-State Dept. expert to Salon: Outside intervention caused Iraq mess, helped create ISIS.

Matthew Hoh is a former Marine who served two tours in Iraq before being stationed in Afghanistan as a high-ranking foreign service officer. In 2009, Hoh resigned in protest from the State Department over the U.S.' misguided occupation of Afghanistan.

Note: This interview was conducted before Defense Secretary Hagel announced that the U.S. was unlikely to send in ground troops to rescue refugees on Mount Sinjar.

You've written that sending U.S. troops back into Iraq, bombing the Islamic State, or otherwise engaging militarily in Iraq's civil war may serve to salve guilty American consciences, but will only exacerbate the country's violent divisions in the long run. With that said, there remain thousands of Yazidi and other non-Sunni refugees stranded and besieged on a mountain, with no access to food and water other than by airlift, dying of starvation, dehydration and sunstroke.

Should it prove to be the case that the deployment of U.S. ground troops is the only means available to carry out an evacuation, is there a valid distinction to be made between that kind of an emergency, humanitarian rescue mission and out-and-out U.S. military intervention in Iraq? Could this be a situation in which some limited use of U.S. military force in the area is justified, and if not, what is the humanitarian alternative?

I think that distinction can be made in theory or in debate, but in practice I don't believe it is possible to put American troops into the middle of the Iraq civil war without supporting one side against another in the conflict. If our troops go into Iraq they will be picking winners and losers in a society they do not understand and in a war that is amazingly complex. This was the genesis of this conflict in 2003. The United States has quite a history of U.S. forces being utilized by one side against another in foreign civil wars, and that utilization only widens and deepens the conflict.

The campaign has left a trail of destruction in cities in Iraq and Syria , likely killed tens of thousands and drove hundreds of thousands from their homes .

Ciya Kobani, an SDF commander, announced the end of the operation from the roof of the building with the SDF flag: “We have been victorious against Daesh,” he declared.

At its height, the Islamic State group ruled a third of both Syria and Iraq, holding millions hostage to its harsh and violent interpretation of Islamic law. The group carried out massacres and documented them with slickly produced videos circulated online. It beheaded foreign journalists and aid workers and burned alive a captured Jordanian pilot. During a rampage through Iraq’s Sinjar region in 2014, it captured thousands of women and girls from the Yazidi religious minority and forced them into sexual slavery. Many remain missing to this day.

The group also used its caliphate as a launchpad for attacks around the globe, including the assaults in Paris in 2015 that killed more than 130 people.

French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted that “a major danger to our country is now eliminated, yet the threat remains and the fight against terrorist groups must continue.” France has been a member of the coalition fighting the IS since 2014.

While it imposed its unforgiving interpretation of Islamic law through public beheadings and crucifixions, the group also carried out the mundane duties of governance in its territories, including regulating prices at markets and repairing infrastructure.

Cornered in Baghouz, the group fought fiercely and desperately to hang on to the last shred of territory it controlled, using thousands of civilians, including women and children, as human shields. In the final weeks, they streamed out of Baghouz, bedraggled, angry and hungry, overwhelming Kurdish-run camps in northern Syria where they are being held.

Aid organizations say more than 100 people have died in the journey from Baghouz to the al-Hol camp in Hassakeh province, or soon after arriving.

Updated

British prime minister David Cameron said he would take ""whatever steps are necessary"" to bring the ""fanatical"" killers of a British aid worker to justice.

A new video from the Islamic State (IS) militant group was released on Sunday showing a masked militant beheading 44-year-old David Haines.

Mr Haines, a father of two originally from Perth in Scotland, was kidnapped last year while working for the French agency ACTED in Syria.

Mr Cameron earlier called an emergency committee meeting to discuss the government's response to the killing, and the threat to a second British hostage by IS extremists.

""We will hunt down those responsible and bring them to justice no matter how long it takes,"" Mr Cameron said after the meeting.

""We are a peaceful people. We do not seek out confrontation but we cannot ignore this threat to our security and that of our allies.""

Describing Mr Haines as a ""British hero"", he said the IS militants were ""not Muslims, they are monsters"".

""We cannot just walk on by if we are to keep this country safe. We have to confront this menace,"" he said.

""Step-by-step, we must drive back, dismantle and ultimately destroy ISIL (Islamic State) and what it stands for.""

He said Britain would work closely with allies to defeat IS through a ""comprehensive and sustained counter-terrorism strategy"".

""But ultimately our security as a nation, the way we go about our everyday lives in this free and tolerant society that is Britain, has always depended on our readiness to act against those who stand for hatred and who stand for destruction.

""And that is exactly what we will do.""

Militant threatens second British hostage

In the video, Mr Haines denounced Mr Cameron for working with the United States against IS.

""Following a trend amongst our British prime ministers who can't find the courage to say no to the Americans,"" he said.

""Unfortunately, it is we, the British public, that will in the end pay the price for our Parliament's selfish decisions.""

Murdered US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff made similar speeches addressing US president Barack Obama, which have been dismissed as scripted by IS.

The militant in the video told Britain the alliance will ""accelerate your destruction"" and will drag the British people into ""another bloody and unwinnable war"".

He also threatened to execute another British hostage.

A day before the video's release, the Haines family appealed to David's captors to contact them.

In a statement, Mr Haines's brother Mike remembered a man who was ""most alive and enthusiastic in his humanitarian roles"".

He said his brother ""was and is loved by all his family and will be missed terribly"".

""He was, in the right mood, the life and soul of the party and on other times the most stubborn irritating pain in the ass. He would probably say the same about me.""

Mike Haines appeared in a video statement on Sunday speaking out against religious radicalisation.

""We are seeing more and more radicalisation in every walk of life. It is not a race, religion or political issue, it is a human issue,"" he said.

""The Muslim faith is not to blame for ISIL, nor is it the fault of people of Middle Eastern descent.""

'Barbaric' crime must be punished

The humanitarian aid group that employed Mr Haines voiced outrage at the ""barbaric crime"" and stressed it should not go unpunished.

ACTED said it was ""deeply stunned and horrified by the heinous assassination"" of Mr Haines that the group ""condemned with the greatest possible force"".

""The horrible assassination of David, a humanitarian worker, goes against every humanitarian principle and affects the whole of the humanitarian community,"" ACTED said.

Before joining ACTED, an international relief charity, Mr Haines had been involved in humanitarian work in the Balkans, parts of Africa and elsewhere in the Middle East.

Mr Haines' wife Dragana Prodanovic is still holed up with the couple's four-year-old daughter in their home in Sisak, Croatia.

The couple met after Haines moved to Croatia in 2000 to work for the German humanitarian organisation Arbeiter Samariter Bund (ASB) in the central towns of Petrinja, Knin and Sisak.

Near their home a handful of journalists wait under the watchful eye of police, hoping to catch a glance of Ms Prodanovic, who has avoided speaking to the press since news of her husband's death was made public.

""Looking at his girl is like looking at my own grandchildren,"" said a neighbour in his 60s, who was visibly shaken.

""After this, we wonder where this world is going.""

FALLUJAH, Iraq — Iraqi military and militia forces rolled into this war-battered city Monday, capturing a police station and advancing the crucial campaign to drive Islamic State militants from one of their last major Iraqi strongholds.

""Our forces are still fighting in three directions in Fallujah,"" said Yahiya Rasul, spokesman of the Joint Operation Command. ""The fight is intense.""

Rasul said the push into the city was tentative as soldiers worked to clear mines and booby traps. ""We are tightening the siege on the militants and advancing carefully,"" he said.

The government views capturing the Sunni-dominated city 35 miles from the capital of Baghdad as key to stopping a spate of deadly terror attacks over the past few months. Suicide bombers blew themselves up in three districts in Baghdad on Monday, killing at least 24 people and injuring dozens more.

Lieutenant General Abdelwahab al-Saadi, the commander of the offensive, said troops entered the city backed by air cover from the U.S.-led military coalition. The U.S. provides extensive support for Iraq’s military, including providing arms, surveillance, intelligence and advisers.

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said in a televised speech to parliament that the ""current phase"" of the battle could be completed in two days.

Iraqi forces initially surrounded Fallujah more than a week ago, cutting off Islamic State from supplies and reinforcements after taking much of the region around the city's center.

Iraq hasn't asked for extra help in Fallujah

Iraqi military starts to retake Fallujah

Fallujah was the first city to fall to the militants when they swept across northern and western Iraq in 2014, bent on building a fundamentalist Sunni caliphate from a wide strip of Iraq and Syria. But Islamic State fortunes waned in recent months, and Fallujah and Mosul are the only major Iraqi cities still under the militants' control.

Conditions in the city steadily deteriorated over the past few months, and the United Nations issued a report in April saying residents face acute shortages of food and medicine.

Iraq’s government has been under political pressure from Sunni leaders to liberate Fallujah, where tens of thousands of people, many of them Sunnis, still live despite years of fighting. Recently, there have been reports of civilians starving in the city, which has increasingly been cut off from the rest of the country.

The Islamic State forced civilians caught in the city to serve as ""human shields"" in areas where the militants expected airstrikes, residents recently USA TODAY.

Abu Mohammed, 24, an optician in Erbil, says his aunt and her family are still trapped in the city, with little to eat and no electricity or water.

“Living conditions are so miserable,"" Mohammed said. “My aunt said that they are eating dates and yogurt for the past month. People go out shopping when it is calm and there is no bombardment.”

“People cannot go to markets, and when they do, the prices are increasing, with the price for a flour bag doubling 10 times,"" he added. ""Vegetables are available now, provided from what is planted inside private home gardens – still only those who live by the river can plant vegetables as the water supply has been cut.”

President Obama previewed his plan for dealing with the Islamic State by comparing it to counterterrorism operations in recent years and said it would not be an invasion akin to the ground war in Iraq.

As he prepares to lay out the details in a speech to the nation Wednesday night, several key factors are likely to determine the success or failure of any military mission.

4. Are Americans prepared for another lengthy military campaign?

Sixty-five percent of Americans now support airstrikes against Syria, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll. That's more than double the number that felt that way a year ago when the president threatened to bomb Syria after it used chemical weapons.

The recent beheadings of two American journalists by the Islamic State provoked outrage and contributed to this surge in support for military action. But that support could evaporate swiftly if things get messy.

Foreign policy commentator Peter Beinart describes Obama as a ""fierce minimalist"" who is willing to use force and take risks against specific terrorism threats. The leading example is the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.

But Obama has resisted broader campaigns throughout his presidency.

""The core of his military effort in Iraq and Syria, and throughout the greater Middle East, is narrow but aggressive anti-terrorism,"" Beinart writes in The Atlantic.

5. What will the unintended consequences be?

Even if a U.S. military effort goes well, the outcomes could be mixed. For example, assume the U.S. greatly weakens the Islamic State in Syria. The most likely beneficiary would be President Bashar Assad's regime — the same one the president was planning to bomb last year.

Also, Iran will be cheering for a successful U.S. military campaign. Iran's Shiite leadership loathes the Sunni extremism of the Islamic State, which is currently threatening the governments of Iraq and Syria, both of which are friendly to Iran.

At the moment, the Islamic State is preoccupied with taking territory in Iraq and Syria and building its self-proclaimed caliphate, or Islamic nation, according to many analysts.

But the challenges do n't stop there .

`` These countries have favored , in various ways , the same anti-Assad rebels that Washington would like to prevail , but also the Islamists that spawned the Islamic State ( IS ) and other jihadi groups that are now beyond their control .

That makes “ Obama ’ s coalition-building challenge as tricky as any orchestrated by his predecessors in the past quarter-century . ”
Dan Murphy , writing the Monitor 's Backchannels column , cautions that arming “ Syrian moderates ” is fraught with uncertainty .
Should the Obama administration arm the `` moderate '' Syrian rebels , whoever they may be ? That was tried last year – and a depot of US supplied weapons was quickly overrun and seized by IS militants , shutting that effort down . Many of the recent US airstrikes in Iraq have destroyed weapons and vehicles the US had previously supplied to the Iraqi Army , which collapsed in the face of the IS offensive on Mosul earlier this summer .
After his tour through the Middle East , Secretary of State Kerry moves to Europe , where he should get a warmer response from governments worried by the fact that hundreds of Europeans have left to fight in Syria .
At the NATO Summit last week in Wales , the US said it had support from Britain , France , Germany , Canada , Australia , Turkey , Italy , Poland , and Denmark .
France has played the most public supporting role so far , pledging to act in an international coalition if international law is followed . French President François Hollande and Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius will travel to Baghdad tomorrow , before France hosts a conference in Paris in Monday to coordinate efforts to tackle the Islamic State .
`` An international mobilization is necessary to respond to this trans-national danger that can reach our territory , '' Mr. Fabius said , according to Reuters . `` In Iraq the government and minorities have called for help ( and ) we answered with deliveries of military equipment and humanitarian aid .

Dan Murphy, writing the Monitor's Backchannels column, cautions that arming “Syrian moderates” is fraught with uncertainty.

Should the Obama administration arm the ""moderate"" Syrian rebels, whoever they may be? That was tried last year – and a depot of US supplied weapons was quickly overrun and seized by IS militants, shutting that effort down. Many of the recent US airstrikes in Iraq have destroyed weapons and vehicles the US had previously supplied to the Iraqi Army, which collapsed in the face of the IS offensive on Mosul earlier this summer.

After his tour through the Middle East, Secretary of State Kerry moves to Europe, where he should get a warmer response from governments worried by the fact that hundreds of Europeans have left to fight in Syria.

At the NATO Summit last week in Wales, the US said it had support from Britain, France, Germany, Canada, Australia, Turkey, Italy, Poland, and Denmark.

France has played the most public supporting role so far, pledging to act in an international coalition if international law is followed. French President François Hollande and Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius will travel to Baghdad tomorrow, before France hosts a conference in Paris in Monday to coordinate efforts to tackle the Islamic State.

""An international mobilization is necessary to respond to this trans-national danger that can reach our territory,"" Mr. Fabius said, according to Reuters. ""In Iraq the government and minorities have called for help (and) we answered with deliveries of military equipment and humanitarian aid.""

This week the UK said it would send a limited amount of arms to Kurds in Iraq to fight the Islamic State. Germany also agreed to do the same.

In a Guardian opinion piece, Hayder al-Khoei, an associate fellow on the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House, said that “the UK should be an important player in the international coalition that Obama is trying to set up to confront the most dangerous terrorist organization of the 21st century.""",www.csmonitor.com,center,zk1DoClueT2dMawn

U.S. Central Command ( Centcom ) said in a statement released early Tuesday that 14 Islamic State targets were hit , including the group 's fighters , training camps , headquarters and command-and-control facilities , and armed vehicles .

Centcom said that other airstrikes hit ISIS targets near the Syrian cities of Dayr az Zawr, Al Hasakah, and Abu Kamal. Also, the U.S. carried out four airstrikes against ISIS in northern Iraq, southwest of the city of Kirkuk.

Military leaders have said about two-thirds of the estimated 31,000 Islamic State militants were in Syria.

Some officials have expressed concern that going after Islamic State militants in Syria could inadvertently help Assad, since the militants are fighting in part to overthrow Assad.

Urged on by the White House and U.S. defense and military officials, Congress passed legislation late last week authorizing the military to arm and train moderate Syrian rebels. Obama signed the bill into law Friday, providing $500 million for the U.S. to train about 5,000 rebels over the next year.

The militant group, meanwhile, has threatened retribution. Its spokesman, Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, said in a 42-minute audio statement released Sunday that the fighters were ready to battle the U.S.-led military coalition and called for attacks at home and abroad.

In fact, we should pick up the pace here. The definition of terrorism is political violence…so we should mark this date down because this is ISIS’ first terrorist attack against the United States.

Meanwhile, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), a presumed presidential hopeful himself, condemned ISIS today in clear and unequivocal terms. Here is what he said:

“The brutal execution of American journalist James Foley by ISIL is the latest example of the evil and barbarism of these terrorists. My thoughts and prayers are with the Foley family and with other Western hostages who at this hour are still being held. “Just as Al Qaeda’s initial killings of Americans abroad foretold the carnage they would unleash within our borders, this barbaric beheading of a defenseless hostage is the clearest indication to date that ISIL has declared war on the United States, on the American people, and on freedom loving people everywhere. “For more than a year, ISIL has been murdering civilians, raping women and young girls and enslaving them, and carrying out a systematic genocide of anyone who does not share their warped and extremist Islamist views. ISIL cannot be reasoned with, they can’t be negotiated with, and their view of the world is irreconcilable with civilized society. “I remain deeply concerned that despite the preponderance of evidence that proves ISIL is a fundamentally evil and dangerous terrorist threat to the United States, President Obama continues to appear unwilling to do what is necessary to confront ISIL and communicate clearly to the American people about the threat ISIL poses to our country and to our way of life.

The president will convene a press conference today to address the alleged beheading of James Wright Foley, and its implications. Stay tuned.",www.townhall.com,right,FCSJu32eLR1MaSDJ

Donna Brazile : President is forging a multinational coalition as novel as ISIS
Obama answered 3 a.m. phone call ; if only he had n't let it ring for 3 years , says Michael Rubin
CNN asked for views on President Obama 's speech , in which he outlined his administration 's plans for addressing the threat posed by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) , including a campaign of airstrikes and a call for Congress to provide additional authority and resources to train and equip opposition fighters in Syria .
President Obama heard his critics and now he has finally responded . After several weeks where Republicans and Democrats complained that the president was being too silent and too passive about the threat posed by ISIS -- and about what his administration planned do about this -- he capped off a week of speeches with this address to the U.S. Congress .
Still , although the speech offered some of the answers that the public has been waiting for , and established a framework for the debate to begin in Congress , the details of the policy remains murky .
The president has vowed to defeat this rising force of militant fundamentalism with a `` steady and relentless effort '' but without using ground troops and while limiting the commitment of U.S. resources . It will be an operation , he said , more like Yemen and Somalia than Iraq or Afghanistan . He has explained that this will be a long-war , but he has not really outlined how the U.S. will know when it is finally time to leave other than the goal or their total destruction .
Moreover , the entire policy is contingent on the U.S. being able to forge viable alliances with rebels and nation-states -- a `` broad coalition '' -- whose support is tenuous at best , and whose own objectives do n't always mesh with the goals of the U.S .
Now will be the time for Congress to rise up to this challenge ( something many observers predict the dysfunctional institution wo n't be capable of doing ) by pressing the administration with tough questions that fill in the details and by conducting a vigorous -- even if speedy -- public debate before handing over its consent to the operations .
But Congress should recall the kind of mistakes that take place when they do n't seriously interrogate the arguments and strategy of a president .

Donna Brazile : Time for Congress to give Obama what he needs
Wednesday night , on the eve of the 13th anniversary of 9/11 , President Obama laid out a comprehensive , multi-tiered , multi-pronged plan to ultimately destroy not al Qaeda , which is weak and sluggish , but ISIL , a unique terrorist organization spawned by the internal Iraqi and Syrian civil wars .
ISIL ( also known as ISIS ) is a relatively new force . Its numbers are small , but it 's media and tech savvy , using brutality to intimidate larger armies . It aims to establish an Islamic super state , in the process seeking to uproot the nation state system that has underpinned both Western and Eastern civilization for hundreds of years . Al Qaeda itself is ISIS 's sworn enemy .
So the president is forging a multinational coalition as novel as ISIS . The nation states with boots on the ground -- the Arab states themselves -- are those most immediately threatened . Obama 's plan involves military intelligence , U.S. airstrikes -- including within Syria -- and the training of Arab troops , including the Sunnis , Kurds , Shiites and others . The president 's strategy employs every tool at the hands of the modern nation state , including withering the finances that support ISIS .
There is a strong political element to this struggle . `` Politics , '' Harry Truman said , `` is a noble art . '' Here , President Obama must nobly forge a consensus with a two-party system that has become more self-centered than patriotic , while simultaneously marshaling public opinion around the world . If the U.S. is serious about defeating the threat of ISIS , Congress will stop its petty nit-picking and publicity mongering , and provide President Obama the authority and resources needed to implement a strategy both sound and necessary .

She is a nationally syndicated columnist , an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and author of `` Cooking With Grease : Stirring the Pots in America . ''
President Obama 's speech was a characteristic exercise in foreign policy minimalism . He said just enough to convince the public he has a plan to defeat the Islamic State . But he said virtually nothing about how to win the long war against Islamist extremism that began 13 years ago tomorrow .
There 's no doubt the president answered his critics tonight . They 've demanded a strategy for rolling back the Islamic State ; he gave them a plausible one . They 've accused him of sounding America 's retreat from global leadership ; he highlighted Washington 's catalytic role in orchestrating the world 's response to ISIS 's murderous rampage , Russia 's aggression against Ukraine , and the Ebola outbreak . `` American leadership is the one constant in an uncertain world , '' he affirmed .
The speech seemed calculated to shore up the public 's sagging confidence in Obama 's stewardship of U.S. foreign policy , and perhaps it will boost his numbers . Donning the mantle of Commander-in-Chief , he conveyed resolve in confronting the Islamist terrorists , while at the same time he was careful not to cross his own red line against reintroducing ground troops in the Middle East . That 's a stance exquisitely calibrated to fit the public 's current mood .
What was missing , however , was an account of where ISIS came from and how it grew so strong . The president neither defended nor offered second thoughts about his decision to disengage from Iraq and the Syrian civil war . Nor did he explain why demolishing al Qaeda has failed to turn the tide of battle against Islamist extremism , as he had hoped . About the ideology that motivates our enemies , he said nothing at all , except to deny it 's really Islamic . He devoted all of one fleeting sentence to the need for America and the international community to more effectively counter the jihadist narrative that inspires young Muslims from Europe as well as the Middle East to commit atrocities in Islam 's name .
However politically effective the speech proves to be , it was strategically vacuous . At some point , the president needs to focus on the larger war we 're embroiled in , not just the next battle .

President Obama 's speech was succinct , specific , and successful . On the details , he made three very important points .
First was the clear statement of precisely how the United States will use force : to take out direct threats -- ISIS troops and weapons -- and to support our partners on the ground in their fight . We are using force not to win outright in a way that leaves us responsible for an ensuing peace , but rather as a thumb on the scale to buy time and create space for the soldiers and citizens who must ultimately win both the war and the peace .
Second , for those older viewers with memories of `` sending in only advisers '' to Vietnam , the president made absolutely clear that we wo n't fight side-by-side with a government that does n't have the support of its own people , nor without a full complement of regional partners . This is a strategy of multilateralism that checks us by ensuring that we ca n't get too far out in front of the nations that must ultimately live with the consequences of our action , but that also checks their ability to free-ride .
Third , the president recognized that ISIS ca n't ultimately be defeated without ending the civil war in Syria , which will require a combination of force and intensive regional diplomacy to reach a political solution . But without that solution , the `` Islamic State '' will simply retreat to its territory in Syria and continue feeding off the terror and chaos there .
More generally , Obama found his stride and his voice in this speech in a way we have n't seen for a long time . He set forth a workable and sensible strategy to defeat ISIS and he linked it not only to U.S. security , but to a deeper sense of who we are as a nation and what we seek to accomplish in the world beyond saving our own skins .
For so many of us , standing `` with people who fight for their own freedom ; and [ rallying ] other nations on behalf of our common security and common humanity '' is a core part of what it means to be American . Living up to those values , or at least trying , is ultimately our greatest security and strength .

Michael Rubin : Coalition may end up being our Achilles ' heel
Finally , President Obama answered that 3 a.m. phone call ; if only he had n't let it ring for three years . Let us now hope that Obama backs his rhetoric with sustained action . The United States has every right to target terrorists who target America , wherever they may be . And Obama seems to have finally recognized that the Islamic States ' defeat -- and not simply its quarantine -- should be the goal .
That goal , Obama seems to acknowledge , does not conform to artificial timelines . Obama also pays lip service to the fact that the radicals ' ideology -- and not simply their grievances -- forms a major part of the problem
That said , Obama may not understand just what is necessary to defeat terror . He cites Somalia as a model . Somalia is a safer place now than a decade ago , but that 's not because of pinprick American airstrikes , but rather a full-fledged occupation by the African Union .
And while reliance on allies looks good on paper , the reality can be different . Turkey has become Pakistan on the Mediterranean , saying one thing to American diplomats , while facilitating the influx of foreign jihadis into Syria behind our backs . And trusting Saudi Arabia to take the lead on de-radicalization is like asking arsonists to be volunteer firefighters . The plan looks good on paper , but the coalition might be our Achilles ' heel .

Frida Ghitis : Can U.S. beat ISIS without helping American foes ?
A fascinating aspect of the strategy Obama announced is his effort to try to defeat ISIS without strengthening America 's foes .
That has always been one of the most difficult problems for the U.S. as it faces the conflict in Syria and now in Iraq : Can Washington line up an effective offensive CAMPAIGN against ISIS without bolstering the Shiite regime in Iran ? Can ISIS be defeated in Syria without handing a victory to President Bashar al-Assad , an enemy of ISIS but also a ruthless dictator ? Can the U.S. help push ISIS out of Iraq without strengthening the Shiite-dominated , and Tehran-friendly , political establishment in Baghdad ?
The plan attempts to thread that needle . If the contents of the speech are to be believed , the administration has rejected suggestions that it should temporarily set aside its concerns about Iran 's regional dominance , about the Sunni-Shiite balance of power , and about al-Assad 's continued hold on power -- all for the sake of defeating ISIS .
Instead , Obama said the U.S. is ramping up support for moderate Syrian forces fighting al-Assad , which also view ISIS as their enemy , something he has resisted doing for years . In Iraq , Obama has pushed for a new government , one with less sectarian favoritism , and has said the U.S. will help rebuild `` National Guard Units , '' reminiscent of the Sunni Awakening Councils that helped stabilize Iran before the U.S. withdrew , but which were later disbanded as Shiites monopolized power .
The approach also helps keep the U.S. from taking sides between Sunnis and Shiites , even as it fights Sunni extremists . And by involving many Arab countries and the international community , it preempts predictable attempts to paint this as a U.S. war against Muslims .
Preventing the war against ISIS from helping Iran , al-Assad and sectarian Iraqis is a politically ambitious effort , and one with no guarantee of success .

The president 's four-pronged strategy of airstrikes , support to local proxies , defending against ISIS attacks through intelligence and counter-terrorism , and humanitarian assistance leaves many unanswered questions . It 's hardly a clear articulation of the sort of long-term , holistic strategy needed to deny ISIS the fertile ground it needs to thrive . The approach is fraught with tradeoffs , risks and hidden costs that need to be addressed .
The focus on targeting ISIS leadership -- drawing from what President Obama hailed as successful campaigns in Yemen and Somalia -- does n't create the conditions on the ground for a lasting solution to the movement . High-value leadership targeting through precision strikes carry the risk of collateral casualties and of radicalization . And the record shows that militant leadership cadres can reconstitute themselves quickly , making such a strategy akin to a game of `` whack-a-mole . ''
The emphasis on coalitions , while laudable in concept , also carries hidden risks : each of Iraq 's Arab neighbors will be pursuing competing agendas that may run counter to America 's stated objectives . And the solicitation of Gulf support will come with costs : the U.S. must be leery of turning a blind eye to the repressive policies of these regimes toward legitimate Islamist opposition groups under the newfound framework of `` counter-terrorism . ''
Each of America 's local allies against ISIS also have their own agendas -- the so-called `` moderate '' Syrian opposition , the Kurdish peshmerga and the Shiite militias , and there 's evidence that each is already using airstrikes as convenient cover to advance their own political objectives .
Ultimately , Baghdad holds the key to the long term : how power is distributed in the capital 's institutions . Obama cited U.S. support for the devolution of security responsibilities to Sunni tribes as part of the national guard structure . But this must be pursued carefully , to avoid setting the conditions for warlordism and militia rule .
Finally , the U.S. should n't focus too much on counter-ideology -- this is an argument without end , and religious factors are probably tangential to the more societal , economic and political grievances that drive the rank-and-file , whether they are alienated young Muslims from the West , Anbari tribes or ex-Baathist officers .
Obama rightfully dismissed ISIS 's religious pretensions . The caliphate discourse is the mobilizing vocabulary for something that is ultimately more mundane and worldly : the absence of credible and inclusive institutions that can temper the appeal of toxic sectarian identities and radical religious voices .

David Gergen : Did Obama open the door to a comeback ?
The consensus view of the Barack Obama 's speech is essentially right : he was strong , serious and presidential -- exactly what a commander in chief should be when committing troops to action . He went from saying several days ago that he had no strategy to laying out a coherent four-point plan . Bottom line : two thirds of Americans already wanted military action against ISIS and his address probably solidified their support .
But did the President also improve his own standing with the American people ? That 's an important question because he needs stronger approval in order to keep the public with him during the inevitable ups and downs that will come in the Middle East .
Polls this past week showed that only about 30 % approve of his handling of foreign policy ; only about 40 % approve of his overall handling of the presidency ; and in a shocker , over 50 % say he has been a failure as president .
Because his numbers have been low for so long , I doubt the speech really lifted him up much personally . But the speech may have opened the door to a comeback . Whether he now breaks out of his slump probably depends on just how well his new , aggressive policy actually works in the next few months . And that , my friends , is probably the biggest question of all coming out of the speech .

Obama 's words last night will go down in history . They will be the coda that illustrates the worst commander-in-chief in modern history .
Sadly , both Democrats and some Republicans heralded the president 's words as a turning point , after which he is supposedly serious about the threat posed to the civilized world by the Islamic State . But we 've seen this before , and have only ourselves to blame if we think it will work better this time .
In Libya , President Obama was impelled to act not by an opportunity to vanquish a longtime American foe , aid beleaguered Arabs facing slaughter , or deny an important geography to jihadists . The casus belli was actually the deep humiliation felt by an Obama administration caught flatfooted by the Arab Spring , including from its own conflicting statements and dithering as a longtime U.S. ally was deposed in Egypt .
Fearing another black eye from chaos and slaughter in neighboring Libya , Obama finally used the might of American air power against a resurgent Gadhafi . But he ignored matters on the ground , refusing to cultivate or arm more palatable rebel groups . This predictably led to the chaos that Islamists are exploiting in that country today . The air campaign did , however , get the administration off the hook in the short term -- allowing Obama to return to his domestic passions .
Obama is now applying this model to ISIS . Air power will impede and possibly reverse its march , but the United States wo n't raise a Sunni army like that which aided the 2007 surge of U.S. forces in Iraq . Instead , the administration remains faithful to the fairytale of a benevolent Shiite government in Baghdad that can restore Iraq .
In Syria , U.S. forces will now strike ISIS at times , but , under the administration 's absurd rules of engagement , the Syrian military itself is presumably off limits . Will the U.S. thus be helping the dictator Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian Civil War ? Will we be helping Iran in Iraq , as Tehran increasingly intervenes to support Shiite Iraq ? Why do we expect Sunnis to rise against ISIS in Sunni Iraq without their own arms and other means of survival ?
Furthermore , this president remains ever unable to link ISIS with the broader collection of jihadists and Islamists who seek the destruction of a civilized order in the world through violence or subversion . This is a phony strategy that is n't worth putting a single American or allied life at risk for .

Donna Brazile: President is forging a multinational coalition as novel as ISIS

Obama answered 3 a.m. phone call; if only he hadn't let it ring for 3 years, says Michael Rubin

Frederic Wehrey: Obama rightfully dismissed ISIS's religious pretensions

CNN asked for views on President Obama's speech , in which he outlined his administration's plans for addressing the threat posed by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), including a campaign of airstrikes and a call for Congress to provide additional authority and resources to train and equip opposition fighters in Syria.

Julian Zelizer: Obama finally responds to his critics

President Obama heard his critics and now he has finally responded. After several weeks where Republicans and Democrats complained that the president was being too silent and too passive about the threat posed by ISIS -- and about what his administration planned do about this -- he capped off a week of speeches with this address to the U.S. Congress.

Still, although the speech offered some of the answers that the public has been waiting for, and established a framework for the debate to begin in Congress, the details of the policy remains murky.

Julian Zelizer

The president has vowed to defeat this rising force of militant fundamentalism with a ""steady and relentless effort"" but without using ground troops and while limiting the commitment of U.S. resources. It will be an operation, he said, more like Yemen and Somalia than Iraq or Afghanistan. He has explained that this will be a long-war, but he has not really outlined how the U.S. will know when it is finally time to leave other than the goal or their total destruction.

Moreover, the entire policy is contingent on the U.S. being able to forge viable alliances with rebels and nation-states -- a ""broad coalition"" -- whose support is tenuous at best, and whose own objectives don't always mesh with the goals of the U.S.

Now will be the time for Congress to rise up to this challenge (something many observers predict the dysfunctional institution won't be capable of doing) by pressing the administration with tough questions that fill in the details and by conducting a vigorous -- even if speedy -- public debate before handing over its consent to the operations.

But Congress should recall the kind of mistakes that take place when they don't seriously interrogate the arguments and strategy of a president.

Donna Brazile: Time for Congress to give Obama what he needs

Wednesday night, on the eve of the 13th anniversary of 9/11, President Obama laid out a comprehensive, multi-tiered, multi-pronged plan to ultimately destroy not al Qaeda, which is weak and sluggish, but ISIL, a unique terrorist organization spawned by the internal Iraqi and Syrian civil wars.

ISIL (also known as ISIS) is a relatively new force. Its numbers are small, but it's media and tech savvy, using brutality to intimidate larger armies. It aims to establish an Islamic super state, in the process seeking to uproot the nation state system that has underpinned both Western and Eastern civilization for hundreds of years. Al Qaeda itself is ISIS's sworn enemy.

Donna Brazile

So the president is forging a multinational coalition as novel as ISIS. The nation states with boots on the ground -- the Arab states themselves -- are those most immediately threatened. Obama's plan involves military intelligence, U.S. airstrikes -- including within Syria -- and the training of Arab troops, including the Sunnis, Kurds, Shiites and others. The president's strategy employs every tool at the hands of the modern nation state, including withering the finances that support ISIS.

There is a strong political element to this struggle. ""Politics,"" Harry Truman said, ""is a noble art."" Here, President Obama must nobly forge a consensus with a two-party system that has become more self-centered than patriotic, while simultaneously marshaling public opinion around the world. If the U.S. is serious about defeating the threat of ISIS, Congress will stop its petty nit-picking and publicity mongering, and provide President Obama the authority and resources needed to implement a strategy both sound and necessary.

Will Marshall: A strategically vacuous speech

President Obama's speech was a characteristic exercise in foreign policy minimalism. He said just enough to convince the public he has a plan to defeat the Islamic State. But he said virtually nothing about how to win the long war against Islamist extremism that began 13 years ago tomorrow.

There's no doubt the president answered his critics tonight. They've demanded a strategy for rolling back the Islamic State; he gave them a plausible one. They've accused him of sounding America's retreat from global leadership; he highlighted Washington's catalytic role in orchestrating the world's response to ISIS's murderous rampage, Russia's aggression against Ukraine, and the Ebola outbreak. ""American leadership is the one constant in an uncertain world,"" he affirmed.

Will Marshall

The speech seemed calculated to shore up the public's sagging confidence in Obama's stewardship of U.S. foreign policy, and perhaps it will boost his numbers. Donning the mantle of Commander-in-Chief, he conveyed resolve in confronting the Islamist terrorists, while at the same time he was careful not to cross his own red line against reintroducing ground troops in the Middle East. That's a stance exquisitely calibrated to fit the public's current mood.

What was missing, however, was an account of where ISIS came from and how it grew so strong. The president neither defended nor offered second thoughts about his decision to disengage from Iraq and the Syrian civil war. Nor did he explain why demolishing al Qaeda has failed to turn the tide of battle against Islamist extremism, as he had hoped. About the ideology that motivates our enemies, he said nothing at all, except to deny it's really Islamic. He devoted all of one fleeting sentence to the need for America and the international community to more effectively counter the jihadist narrative that inspires young Muslims from Europe as well as the Middle East to commit atrocities in Islam's name.

However politically effective the speech proves to be, it was strategically vacuous. At some point, the president needs to focus on the larger war we're embroiled in, not just the next battle.

Anne-Marie Slaughter: Obama found his stride

President Obama's speech was succinct, specific, and successful. On the details, he made three very important points.

First was the clear statement of precisely how the United States will use force: to take out direct threats -- ISIS troops and weapons -- and to support our partners on the ground in their fight. We are using force not to win outright in a way that leaves us responsible for an ensuing peace, but rather as a thumb on the scale to buy time and create space for the soldiers and citizens who must ultimately win both the war and the peace.

Anne-Marie Slaughter

Second, for those older viewers with memories of ""sending in only advisers"" to Vietnam, the president made absolutely clear that we won't fight side-by-side with a government that doesn't have the support of its own people, nor without a full complement of regional partners. This is a strategy of multilateralism that checks us by ensuring that we can't get too far out in front of the nations that must ultimately live with the consequences of our action, but that also checks their ability to free-ride.

Third, the president recognized that ISIS can't ultimately be defeated without ending the civil war in Syria, which will require a combination of force and intensive regional diplomacy to reach a political solution. But without that solution, the ""Islamic State"" will simply retreat to its territory in Syria and continue feeding off the terror and chaos there.

More generally, Obama found his stride and his voice in this speech in a way we haven't seen for a long time. He set forth a workable and sensible strategy to defeat ISIS and he linked it not only to U.S. security, but to a deeper sense of who we are as a nation and what we seek to accomplish in the world beyond saving our own skins.

For so many of us, standing ""with people who fight for their own freedom; and [rallying] other nations on behalf of our common security and common humanity"" is a core part of what it means to be American. Living up to those values, or at least trying, is ultimately our greatest security and strength.

Michael Rubin: Coalition may end up being our Achilles' heel

Finally, President Obama answered that 3 a.m. phone call; if only he hadn't let it ring for three years. Let us now hope that Obama backs his rhetoric with sustained action. The United States has every right to target terrorists who target America, wherever they may be. And Obama seems to have finally recognized that the Islamic States' defeat -- and not simply its quarantine -- should be the goal.

That goal, Obama seems to acknowledge, does not conform to artificial timelines. Obama also pays lip service to the fact that the radicals' ideology -- and not simply their grievances -- forms a major part of the problem

Michael Rubin

That said, Obama may not understand just what is necessary to defeat terror. He cites Somalia as a model. Somalia is a safer place now than a decade ago, but that's not because of pinprick American airstrikes, but rather a full-fledged occupation by the African Union.

And while reliance on allies looks good on paper, the reality can be different. Turkey has become Pakistan on the Mediterranean, saying one thing to American diplomats, while facilitating the influx of foreign jihadis into Syria behind our backs. And trusting Saudi Arabia to take the lead on de-radicalization is like asking arsonists to be volunteer firefighters. The plan looks good on paper, but the coalition might be our Achilles' heel.

Frida Ghitis: Can U.S. beat ISIS without helping American foes?

A fascinating aspect of the strategy Obama announced is his effort to try to defeat ISIS without strengthening America's foes.

That has always been one of the most difficult problems for the U.S. as it faces the conflict in Syria and now in Iraq: Can Washington line up an effective offensive CAMPAIGN against ISIS without bolstering the Shiite regime in Iran? Can ISIS be defeated in Syria without handing a victory to President Bashar al-Assad, an enemy of ISIS but also a ruthless dictator? Can the U.S. help push ISIS out of Iraq without strengthening the Shiite-dominated, and Tehran-friendly, political establishment in Baghdad?

Frida Ghitis

The plan attempts to thread that needle. If the contents of the speech are to be believed, the administration has rejected suggestions that it should temporarily set aside its concerns about Iran's regional dominance, about the Sunni-Shiite balance of power, and about al-Assad's continued hold on power -- all for the sake of defeating ISIS.

Instead, Obama said the U.S. is ramping up support for moderate Syrian forces fighting al-Assad, which also view ISIS as their enemy, something he has resisted doing for years. In Iraq, Obama has pushed for a new government, one with less sectarian favoritism, and has said the U.S. will help rebuild ""National Guard Units,"" reminiscent of the Sunni Awakening Councils that helped stabilize Iran before the U.S. withdrew, but which were later disbanded as Shiites monopolized power.

The approach also helps keep the U.S. from taking sides between Sunnis and Shiites, even as it fights Sunni extremists. And by involving many Arab countries and the international community, it preempts predictable attempts to paint this as a U.S. war against Muslims.

Preventing the war against ISIS from helping Iran, al-Assad and sectarian Iraqis is a politically ambitious effort, and one with no guarantee of success.

Frederic Wehrey: Will U.S. end up playing ""whack-a-mole""?

The president's four-pronged strategy of airstrikes, support to local proxies, defending against ISIS attacks through intelligence and counter-terrorism, and humanitarian assistance leaves many unanswered questions. It's hardly a clear articulation of the sort of long-term, holistic strategy needed to deny ISIS the fertile ground it needs to thrive. The approach is fraught with tradeoffs, risks and hidden costs that need to be addressed.

The focus on targeting ISIS leadership -- drawing from what President Obama hailed as successful campaigns in Yemen and Somalia -- doesn't create the conditions on the ground for a lasting solution to the movement. High-value leadership targeting through precision strikes carry the risk of collateral casualties and of radicalization. And the record shows that militant leadership cadres can reconstitute themselves quickly, making such a strategy akin to a game of ""whack-a-mole.""

Frederic Wehrey

The emphasis on coalitions, while laudable in concept, also carries hidden risks: each of Iraq's Arab neighbors will be pursuing competing agendas that may run counter to America's stated objectives. And the solicitation of Gulf support will come with costs: the U.S. must be leery of turning a blind eye to the repressive policies of these regimes toward legitimate Islamist opposition groups under the newfound framework of ""counter-terrorism.""

Each of America's local allies against ISIS also have their own agendas -- the so-called ""moderate"" Syrian opposition, the Kurdish peshmerga and the Shiite militias, and there's evidence that each is already using airstrikes as convenient cover to advance their own political objectives.

Ultimately, Baghdad holds the key to the long term: how power is distributed in the capital's institutions. Obama cited U.S. support for the devolution of security responsibilities to Sunni tribes as part of the national guard structure. But this must be pursued carefully, to avoid setting the conditions for warlordism and militia rule.

Finally, the U.S. shouldn't focus too much on counter-ideology -- this is an argument without end, and religious factors are probably tangential to the more societal, economic and political grievances that drive the rank-and-file, whether they are alienated young Muslims from the West, Anbari tribes or ex-Baathist officers.

Obama rightfully dismissed ISIS's religious pretensions. The caliphate discourse is the mobilizing vocabulary for something that is ultimately more mundane and worldly: the absence of credible and inclusive institutions that can temper the appeal of toxic sectarian identities and radical religious voices.

David Gergen: Did Obama open the door to a comeback?

The consensus view of the Barack Obama's speech is essentially right: he was strong, serious and presidential -- exactly what a commander in chief should be when committing troops to action. He went from saying several days ago that he had no strategy to laying out a coherent four-point plan. Bottom line: two thirds of Americans already wanted military action against ISIS and his address probably solidified their support.

David Gergen

But did the President also improve his own standing with the American people? That's an important question because he needs stronger approval in order to keep the public with him during the inevitable ups and downs that will come in the Middle East.

Polls this past week showed that only about 30% approve of his handling of foreign policy; only about 40% approve of his overall handling of the presidency; and in a shocker, over 50% say he has been a failure as president.

Because his numbers have been low for so long, I doubt the speech really lifted him up much personally. But the speech may have opened the door to a comeback. Whether he now breaks out of his slump probably depends on just how well his new, aggressive policy actually works in the next few months. And that, my friends, is probably the biggest question of all coming out of the speech.

Christian Whiton: It's a phony strategy

Obama's words last night will go down in history. They will be the coda that illustrates the worst commander-in-chief in modern history.

Sadly, both Democrats and some Republicans heralded the president's words as a turning point, after which he is supposedly serious about the threat posed to the civilized world by the Islamic State. But we've seen this before, and have only ourselves to blame if we think it will work better this time.

Christian Whiton

In Libya, President Obama was impelled to act not by an opportunity to vanquish a longtime American foe, aid beleaguered Arabs facing slaughter, or deny an important geography to jihadists. The casus belli was actually the deep humiliation felt by an Obama administration caught flatfooted by the Arab Spring, including from its own conflicting statements and dithering as a longtime U.S. ally was deposed in Egypt.

Fearing another black eye from chaos and slaughter in neighboring Libya, Obama finally used the might of American air power against a resurgent Gadhafi. But he ignored matters on the ground, refusing to cultivate or arm more palatable rebel groups. This predictably led to the chaos that Islamists are exploiting in that country today. The air campaign did, however, get the administration off the hook in the short term -- allowing Obama to return to his domestic passions.

Obama is now applying this model to ISIS. Air power will impede and possibly reverse its march, but the United States won't raise a Sunni army like that which aided the 2007 surge of U.S. forces in Iraq. Instead, the administration remains faithful to the fairytale of a benevolent Shiite government in Baghdad that can restore Iraq.

In Syria, U.S. forces will now strike ISIS at times, but, under the administration's absurd rules of engagement, the Syrian military itself is presumably off limits. Will the U.S. thus be helping the dictator Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian Civil War? Will we be helping Iran in Iraq, as Tehran increasingly intervenes to support Shiite Iraq? Why do we expect Sunnis to rise against ISIS in Sunni Iraq without their own arms and other means of survival?

Furthermore, this president remains ever unable to link ISIS with the broader collection of jihadists and Islamists who seek the destruction of a civilized order in the world through violence or subversion. This is a phony strategy that isn't worth putting a single American or allied life at risk for.

Amal Mudallali: U.S. must follow up

President Obama's announcement of his strategy to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" ISIS might have assured Americans, but it didn't answer many questions on the mind of the peoples of the region, especially those in Iraq and Syria.

People are relieved that the president moved to confront the threat of ISIS, but there is concern that this new American strategy might be strong on counter terrorism and short on the political component necessary to win the war on terrorism.

The Sunni grievances, which led to the rise of ISIS in Iraq and Syria, are being addressed now in Iraq by a new government, thanks to American pressure. But on Syria the strategy is vague. The president spoke of a ""political solution necessary to solve Syria's crisis once and for all."" This will sure please the Syrians, but the president didn't elaborate on what kind of a solution he sees for Syria or offer a road man. Granted, he announced ramping up the military assistance to the Syrian opposition. But he put the onus on the Congress.

There is fear that absence of a strategy after the airstrikes will mean the Syrian regime and its allies might fill the vacuum. There is also concern about a long war, and about creating a perception that this is a war against the Sunnis. A lot of things have to be done right by Washington and its allies to make sure this is a successful campaign.

This strategy is a test for the president and his administration -- if there is no follow up, and if the U.S. does not get it right this time, the price will be far too high for everybody.

The heyday of `` war tourism '' was probably the 1930s , when a host of intellectuals and artists left the U.S. to bear witness to the Spanish Civil War . Ernest Hemingway wrote about it . George Orwell , just to name another , actually fought in it .
Regular people from all walks of life showed up on those fields of battle as well , in much the same way young men — both Muslim and non-Muslim — are streaming to Syria today . The modern-day result : Instead of newspaper articles and Orwell 's boook , Homage to Catalonia , there are literally hundreds of Facebook entries that chronicle the fight .
Some , like this one from former Army Pvt . Eric Harroun , seem a bit naïve .
`` Bashir al-Assad your days are numbered , you 're going down in flames , '' Harroun posted on his Facebook page last year . `` You should just quit now while you can and leave ... you 're going to die no matter what ... where ever you go we will find you and kill you . ''
U.S. intelligence officials tracking American fighters believe that at least 140 of them have gone to fight in Syria and Iraq so far . They say the number of U.S. passport holders now in the fight has more than doubled since the beginning of the year .
The problem is that officials are n't sure which groups the fighters have joined . Fighting for the group known as the Islamic State , which killed American journalist James Foley last week , or al-Qaida 's affiliate in Syria , Jabhat al-Nusra , is a violation of U.S. law . Both have been designated terrorist organizations . But because there are literally thousands of groups fighting in Syria now , it is difficult to sort out who is a threat returning from Syria and who is n't .
Harroun spent about six weeks fighting with rebel groups in Syria . Initially he was linked to the Free Syrian Army , and over that time he provided a visual atlas of his journey by posting a steady stream of videos on Facebook and YouTube .
`` I 've been separated from my squad , having been hit by shrapnel , '' Harroun says , looking into a camera phone as he recorded . `` I came into this old building and I do n't know if that 's my last ... video or not . ''
He flinches as shots are fired in the background and the building where he is hiding shakes . `` We 're getting blasted out here , I have one clip , two , three , three full clips left ... my grenade ... so ... Bye . ''
Andrew Tabler , a Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , followed the Harroun case as it played out on YouTube .
`` Eric Harroun 's story in Syria is one of an American concerned about the Middle East who enters the very chaotic situation inside of Syria and gets caught up in a game that is beyond his comprehension , '' says Tabler . `` Unfortunately he was caught on the wrong side of it . ''
Harroun was on the wrong side because when he returned to the U.S. , he was arrested on terrorism charges . That 's because while he started out with the Free Syrian Army , he later joined an avowedly anti-American Islamist fighting force called the Al-Aqsa Islamic Brigades .
`` As a practical matter , it is just a bad idea for U.S. citizens to be fighting , '' says Neil MacBride , the U.S. attorney in Virginia who led the Harroun prosecution . `` There has yet to be a happy ending from a U.S. citizen going abroad and fighting on the ground in Syria . The Harroun case did n't end well . ''
Harroun had been in Egypt during the uprising in Cairo 's Tahrir Square , and expected to see something similar happen in Syria when Syrians started rising up against the government of Bashar Assad in 2011 .
Harroun wanted to be a part of it , so he joined forces with the Free Syrian Army , the group that the Obama administration is now considering supporting with more arms and training .
The problem in Syria is that the fighting is so chaotic , and it is hard to tell one group from another . In Harroun 's case it was doubly difficult , because he did n't speak Arabic .
`` He had no idea what he was getting into , '' Tabler says .
That 's why Harroun 's crime ended up being one of proximity . Harroun told investigators and his Facebook followers that he ended up fighting Assad alongside Jabat al-Nusra , al-Qaida 's affiliate in Syria . That 's why the original charges against him were terrorism related .
MacBride said Harroun 's group , the Al-Aqsa Islamic Brigades , was just as virulent as al-Qaida , but it was n't on the U.S. list of designated terrorist organizations .
MacBride said Harroun knew he was with an Anti-American group , but Harroun convinced prosecutors that he did n't go to Syria intending to join one .
MacBride says that 's an indication of just how confusing the Syrian battlefield has become .
`` It is certainly true that some may have noble and even patriotic reasons for going over there , '' MacBride says . `` But on the ground it has proven to be such a complex and challenging situation , where the groups are so overlapping , with shifting allegiances , that as a practical matter it is a threat to national security to have Americans going abroad and putting themselves in that situation . ''
Essentially , that means anyone who fights in Syria , regardless of the group that takes them in , is considered suspect now . That goes a long way toward explaining why U.S. law enforcement 's approach now appears to be to assume the worst , and why the FBI has started arresting people before they leave for Syria . A handful have been arrested so far this year — nearly all of which have some connection to the Islamic State .
Eventually , U.S. officials decided Harroun was n't such a threat . After six months in solitary confinement in Alexandria , Va. , he was released with time served and charged with illegally providing weapons to a foreign fighting force .
But his story ends badly : Harroun died of an overdose of prescription pills this past April . His family said the death was an accident .","U.S. Officials Try To Gauge Threat From American Fighters In Syria

U.S. intelligence officials tracking American fighters believe that at least 140 of them have gone to fight in Syria and Iraq so far. They say the number of U.S. passport holders now in the fight has more than doubled since the beginning of the year.

The problem is that officials aren't sure which groups the fighters have joined. Fighting for the group known as the Islamic State, which killed American journalist James Foley last week, or al-Qaida's affiliate in Syria, Jabhat al-Nusra, is a violation of U.S. law. Both have been designated terrorist organizations. But because there are literally thousands of groups fighting in Syria now, it is difficult to sort out who is a threat returning from Syria and who isn't.

A Chaotic Situation In Syria

Harroun spent about six weeks fighting with rebel groups in Syria. Initially he was linked to the Free Syrian Army, and over that time he provided a visual atlas of his journey by posting a steady stream of videos on Facebook and YouTube.

""I've been separated from my squad, having been hit by shrapnel,"" Harroun says, looking into a camera phone as he recorded. ""I came into this old building and I don't know if that's my last ... video or not.""

He flinches as shots are fired in the background and the building where he is hiding shakes. ""We're getting blasted out here, I have one clip, two, three, three full clips left ... my grenade ... so ... Bye.""

Andrew Tabler, a Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, followed the Harroun case as it played out on YouTube.

""Eric Harroun's story in Syria is one of an American concerned about the Middle East who enters the very chaotic situation inside of Syria and gets caught up in a game that is beyond his comprehension,"" says Tabler. ""Unfortunately he was caught on the wrong side of it.""

Harroun was on the wrong side because when he returned to the U.S., he was arrested on terrorism charges. That's because while he started out with the Free Syrian Army, he later joined an avowedly anti-American Islamist fighting force called the Al-Aqsa Islamic Brigades.

""As a practical matter, it is just a bad idea for U.S. citizens to be fighting,"" says Neil MacBride, the U.S. attorney in Virginia who led the Harroun prosecution. ""There has yet to be a happy ending from a U.S. citizen going abroad and fighting on the ground in Syria. The Harroun case didn't end well.""

'No Idea What He Was Getting Into'

Harroun had been in Egypt during the uprising in Cairo's Tahrir Square, and expected to see something similar happen in Syria when Syrians started rising up against the government of Bashar Assad in 2011.

Harroun wanted to be a part of it, so he joined forces with the Free Syrian Army, the group that the Obama administration is now considering supporting with more arms and training.

The problem in Syria is that the fighting is so chaotic, and it is hard to tell one group from another. In Harroun's case it was doubly difficult, because he didn't speak Arabic.

""He had no idea what he was getting into,"" Tabler says.

That's why Harroun's crime ended up being one of proximity. Harroun told investigators and his Facebook followers that he ended up fighting Assad alongside Jabat al-Nusra, al-Qaida's affiliate in Syria. That's why the original charges against him were terrorism related.

MacBride said Harroun's group, the Al-Aqsa Islamic Brigades, was just as virulent as al-Qaida, but it wasn't on the U.S. list of designated terrorist organizations.

MacBride said Harroun knew he was with an Anti-American group, but Harroun convinced prosecutors that he didn't go to Syria intending to join one.

MacBride says that's an indication of just how confusing the Syrian battlefield has become.

""It is certainly true that some may have noble and even patriotic reasons for going over there,"" MacBride says. ""But on the ground it has proven to be such a complex and challenging situation, where the groups are so overlapping, with shifting allegiances, that as a practical matter it is a threat to national security to have Americans going abroad and putting themselves in that situation.""

U.S. Officials Assume The Worst

Essentially, that means anyone who fights in Syria, regardless of the group that takes them in, is considered suspect now. That goes a long way toward explaining why U.S. law enforcement's approach now appears to be to assume the worst, and why the FBI has started arresting people before they leave for Syria. A handful have been arrested so far this year — nearly all of which have some connection to the Islamic State.

Eventually, U.S. officials decided Harroun wasn't such a threat. After six months in solitary confinement in Alexandria, Va., he was released with time served and charged with illegally providing weapons to a foreign fighting force.

But his story ends badly: Harroun died of an overdose of prescription pills this past April. His family said the death was an accident.",www.npr.org,center,kwiQ6D4EFUtG2ElK
