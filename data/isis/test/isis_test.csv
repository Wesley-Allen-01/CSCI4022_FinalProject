The operation includes up to 7,500 Peshmergas -- the Kurdish military force -- who are attacking the city from three sides to take control of supply routes , according to the Kurdish Region Security Council .
CNN senior international correspondent Nick Paton Walsh is with one of the three fronts of fighters who launched their liberation operation early Thursday morning against a backdrop of airstrikes .
The U.S.-backed coalition Operation Inherent Resolve said coalition aircraft have conducted more than 250 airstrikes across northern Iraq in the last month . The strikes have reportedly destroyed ISIS fighting positions , command and control facilities , weapon storage facilities , improvised explosive device factories , and staging areas .
`` A pitch-black sky was lit up by a lot of coalition airstrikes following days of bombing . At dawn , a large procession of Peshmerga started snaking their way through Sinjar mountain and behind it , '' Paton Walsh said .
The coalition strikes were pounding the strategic city itself , he said , with four different columns of smoke darkening the horizon above : `` The strikes on Sinjar almost make the sky over it look black . There 's a vast amount of air power -- more intense than the fight for Kobani . ''

Kobani is a Syrian border town that was wrested back from ISIS militants earlier this year after four months of fierce fighting that left parts of it entirely flattened .
According to a Pentagon spokesman , U.S. troops are in the field calling in airstrikes from positions in Sinjar .
`` The Peshmerga forces are carrying this out with , as you said , the support of coalition advisers . There are U.S. personnel . My understanding is there are coalition advisers from other countries as well participating , '' Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook told reporters .
He added : `` Most of those folks as I understand it are behind the front lines advising and working directly with Peshmerga commanders . There are some advisers who are on Sinjar mountain assisting in the selection of airstrike targets . ''
Late Thursday , the Kurdish Region Security Council released a statement detailing the day 's operations . It reported that more than 150 square kilometers ( 60 square miles ) had been retaken from ISIS .
`` Peshmerga units will continue from three fronts to set up defensive positions , allowing engineering teams to clear the heavily mined area . Peshmerga forces have already achieved two of three strategic goals , dealing a significant blow to ISIL morals , '' it read , using an alternative acronym for ISIS . `` The final objective -- to enter and clear the city -- will be underway soon . ''
Reclaiming Sinjar is one big step toward dividing the `` caliphate '' that ISIS claims it is establishing across the region .
The artery that passes through the town links the Iraqi city of Mosul -- ISIS ' prized possession -- with cities it holds in Syria .
Paton Walsh said the highway was a key goal for the Kurdish fighters , who were equipped with vehicles ranging from pickup trucks to armored Humvees .
`` One of the targets of this offensive is the highway that runs through Sinjar , known as Route No . 47 to many . Now that 's very important , not only of course because of what it does to liberate the population of Sinjar -- those who 've not fled ISIS rule having endured it now for over a year -- but also because it is a vital supply route towards Mosul , another key target of any future coalition offensive , '' he said .
About 1.5 million people still live in Mosul , where prices are rising and activists report hunger .
The U.S.-backed coalition said `` Operation Free Sinjar '' was aimed at clearing ISIS from Sinjar and seizing portions of Highway 47 .
`` By controlling Highway 47 , which is used by Da'ish to transport weapons , fighters , illicit oil , and other commodities that fund their operations , the Coalition intends to increase pressure on Da'ish and isolate their components from each other , '' it said in a statement . Da'ish is the Arabic acronym for ISIS .

`` This operation will degrade Da'ish 's resupply efforts , disrupt funding to the terrorist group 's operations , stem the flow of Da'ish fighters into Iraq , and further isolate Mosul from Ar Raqqah , '' said coalition spokesman Col. Christopher C. Garver . The Syrian city of Ar Raqqah , also spelled Raqqa , is ISIS ' de facto capital .
By Thursday afternoon , the Kurdish fighters pushing toward Sinjar had taken control of a number of villages near the Iraqi town .
`` Along that highway there 's one village , Kabara , that 's been repeatedly hammered by airstrikes in the past hour or so and a lot of Kurdish forces have managed to move into the main road , '' Paton Walsh said . Tweets by Kurdish fighters showed that almost all the vehicles in the village had been `` burned to a crisp . ''
Before the push to retake Sinjar began , Kurdish fighters said they knew it would n't be easy .
Peshmerga commanders estimate some 600 ISIS fighters are inside Sinjar , with recent reinforcements boosting the militants ' numbers . The Kurdish fighters believe they will encounter hundreds of landmines and booby traps .
Paton Walsh said it was unclear how ISIS would respond to the offensive .
`` As you 've seen in the past , sometimes ISIS have decided that certain fights are not worth them staying for the long haul , and I think there is a certain amount of manpower and mass here -- and also coalition air power , which we heard from the top of Mount Sinjar , during a very dark , cold night yesterday , pound targets consistently around that particular city . ''
Paton Walsh said there had been a `` substantial uptick '' in airstrikes on Sinjar in the days leading up to the launch of the offensive .
Speaking to CNN 's Fareed Zakaria , U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said he 's confident Sinjar will fall , but was reluctant to say when .
`` But I am convinced that Sinjar will be liberated , as we have liberated Tikrit . And currently the Iraqi forces are moving on Ramadi , '' he said .
`` President Obama , at the very beginning , said we 're going to degrade and defeat ISIL . We 're going to stabilize the countries in the region -- Jordan , Lebanon , work with Turkey -- and we are going to seek a political settlement , '' he said . `` That is exactly the strategy today and it is working -- to a degree -- not as fast as we would like , perhaps , but we are making gains . ''
`` I think the issue will be for ISIS , given the nature of the offensive -- from three different directions -- quite what their best strategy is : to sit here and try and symbolically hold it as long as they can , or pull out , '' Paton Walsh said .
`` ISIS of course may also be feeling pressure on other fronts . There 's been a lot of talk about the possibility of a move against Ramadi for the past few months .

`` We 've not seen any evidence of that at this particular stage but there is a genuine feeling that maybe the coalition -- after months of paralysis , months of calm -- might also slowly be beginning to get some kind of harmony or synchronicity here in terms of moving on separate fronts against ISIS and perhaps stretching what resources they have a little bit thinner . ''
A coalition spokesman in Baghdad told reporters later Thursday that Iraqi security forces had begun to encircle Ramadi , with support from coalition air power .
ISIS fighters swept into Ramadi in May , tightening control of Iraq 's Anbar province and gaining a base of operations about 110 kilometers ( 70 miles ) away from the capital , Baghdad .
Paton Walsh said the operation to retake Sinjar was important symbolically .
`` The Peshmerga here want to show that they can be united with coalition air power , with Western military advisers , who we understand are in their midst here as well , to launch a successful -- and they hope brief -- offensive towards this town , but also strategically , because of what Sinjar could mean in the future , down the line . ''
He said the Kurdish fighters appeared optimistic they would take back Sinjar .
`` I think the hope amongst the Peshmerga and the coalition is that the level of manpower they have here , their dominance in the skies , means potentially this could be over in days , '' he said . `` But with a town of this size which had tens of thousands living in it before -- which ISIS has had months to prepare for an onslaught against -- this could turn out to be trickier than some are hoping . ''
Retired Lt. Col. Rick Francona , a CNN military analyst , agreed that the fight in Sinjar would be slow going .
`` They 're going to have to slog through this house by house , street by street , '' he said . `` It 's going to be very difficult . ''

The world watched in horror last year as some 50,000 Yazidis , who live in the region , scrambled up Mount Sinjar to escape the ISIS onslaught . About 5,000 men and boys in Sinjar and nearby villages were massacred , according to U.N. estimates , while teenage girls and women were sold into slavery
Since then , Sinjar has become a chaotic jumble of demolished buildings held by ISIS fighters .
`` There is no reliable estimate as to how many civilians still live inside of Sinjar , '' Paton Walsh said .
`` You can tell how many seem to have fled , from the tents the Yazidis have erected up around Mount Sinjar -- even in this bitter cold -- still enduring a life here , wanting to be near their hometown . But that is the key concern obviously in situations like this . Many will be fearing that the amount of lead-up time has given ISIS adequate ability to ensure the civilian population are in place to assist them in protecting themselves . ''
The Peshmerga said they wanted to establish a buffer zone to protect the civilian population , but it was not entirely clear how that would physically work , Paton Walsh said .

Peshmerga and coalition unity

Reclaiming Sinjar is one big step toward dividing the ""caliphate"" that ISIS claims it is establishing across the region.

With the operation to retake the town looming, some 5,000 Yazidi fighters were mobilized under the command of the Kurdish Peshmerga. Most are farmers; a very few have military experience.

ISIS beheaded another Westerner , a British aid worker . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry courted Middle Eastern leaders to join a coalition in the fight against the Islamist militants . And U.S. planes aimed at ISIS fighters near Iraq 's capital .
As world leaders struggled Monday to come up with strategies against ISIS just days after a high-profile beheading by the Islamist militants , the U.S. military targeted an ISIS position near Baghdad .
An airstrike southwest of the city appears to be the closest the U.S. airstrikes have come to the Iraqi capital since the start of the campaign against the Islamist militants , a senior U.S. military official told CNN .
A statement from U.S. Central Command described the action as `` the first strike taken as part of our expanded efforts beyond protecting our own people and humanitarian missions to hit ( ISIS ) targets as Iraqi forces go on offense , as outlined in the President 's speech last Wednesday . ''
An ISIS `` fighting position '' that was firing on Iraqi security forces southwest of Baghdad was destroyed , the statement said .
Meanwhile , more than two dozen nations , the Arab League , the European Union and United Nations met in the French capital , calling ISIS a threat to the international community and agreeing to `` ensure that the culprits are brought to justice . ''

In a statement at the conference 's conclusion , the French government said the participants had agreed to take on ISIS `` by any means necessary , including appropriate military assistance , in line with the needs expressed by the Iraqi authorities , in accordance with international law and without jeopardizing civilian security . ''
French President François Hollande , who hosted the conference with his Iraqi counterpart , Fuad Masum , said there was `` no time to lose '' in international efforts against ISIS .
Meanwhile , the leader of Iraq 's Kurdistan region asked for intensified U.S. airstrikes , saying he would welcome foreign fighters and urging Iran and the United States to set aside their differences to fight ISIS .
ISIS , which calls itself the Islamic State , underlined its barbaric credentials over the weekend -- posting a video showing the beheading of British aid worker David Haines and threatening the life of another hostage from the United Kingdom .
It was the third videotaped killing of a Western hostage released in less than a month .
The latest killing , ISIS said , was `` a message to the allies of America '' -- a direct challenge to the United States .
President Barack Obama announced last week that the United States would lead `` a broad coalition to roll back this terrorist threat '' and that U.S. airstrikes against ISIS would expand from Iraq into Syria .
The United States has said nearly 40 nations have agreed to contribute to the fight against ISIS , which has seized control of large areas of northern Iraq and Syria . But it remains unclear exactly which countries are on that list and what roles they 'll play .
Britain 's role in the coalition is in particular focus after the killing of Haines , who was abducted last year near a Syrian refugee camp where he was working .
Haines ' death `` will not lead Britain to shirk our responsibility '' to work with allies to take on ISIS , British Prime Minister David Cameron said Sunday . Instead , he said , `` it must strengthen our resolve . ''
Cameron pledged to work with the United States to support its `` direct military action . '' He also emphasized that `` this is not about British troops on the ground . ''
Cameron has vowed to `` hunt down those responsible '' for Haines ' killing and `` bring them to justice , no matter how long it takes . ''

The situation is made all the more difficult by the fact that the man who appears in the video beheading Haines -- believed to be the same man previously shown killing American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff -- has a London accent .
Cameron knows the identity of the killer , CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen has reported , citing unidentified British officials . But authorities are n't making it public for `` operational reasons , '' Bergen writes in a commentary for CNN
Cameron knows that the man in the video holds at least two other American citizens as well as other hostages from additional Western countries , and that he is part of a larger group of British hostage-takers working for ISIS , Bergen reports .
`` It is a real crisis for Cameron , and it underlines a sobering fact : British citizens have volunteered to go to Syria to fight at 25 times the rate that Americans have done so , when adjusted for population size , '' he writes .
Kerry , who attended the Paris conference Monday , closed out a Middle Eastern trip on Saturday , seeking to win support for the U.S.-led anti-ISIS coalition .
In an interview that aired Sunday on CBS ' `` Face the Nation , '' Kerry said some nations `` are clearly prepared to take action in the air alongside the United States and to do airstrikes , if that 's what they 're called on to do , '' but he did not get more specific .
Britain has agreed to help arm Kurdish forces , support the Iraqi government , keep supplying humanitarian help and coordinate with the United Nations to battle ISIS .
France , meanwhile , began reconnaissance flights over Iraq , the French Defense Ministry said . Two Rafale air force planes took off from a base in the United Arab Emirates , it said .
Some nations have also offered to commit ground troops , but `` we are not looking for that at this moment anyway , '' Kerry said in the CBS interview .
Iraqi Kurdistan 's President Masoud Barzani -- whose Peshmerga forces have taken a significant role in battling ISIS -- told CNN 's Anna Coren on Monday that he has not asked for foreign fighters but would welcome them .
He also called on the United States to step up airstrikes and said Iran should play a role in battling ISIS . But that can only happen , he said , if Iran and the United States `` put their differences aside . ''
Iran has rejected any cooperation with the United States to combat ISIS in Iraq , Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei said on his Twitter account Monday . `` I rejected ( the ) US offer to Iran about ISIS , because US has corrupted its hands in this issue , '' the statement read .
Khamanei accused the United States of planning to use military action against ISIS to `` dominate the region . ''
A leading Iraqi expert on ISIS told CNN that Obama may already have revealed more about U.S. plans than he should have to the militant group 's leader , Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi .

`` The mistake was announcing too much of the strategy , and this was a free gift to al-Baghdadi to prepare and counter what has been revealed , '' said Hisham al-Hashimi , who has studied jihadist groups and their evolution in Iraq over the past decade .
He suggested ISIS has already begun to take defensive measures , including moving weapons and ammunition into depots and putting elite fighters among civilian populations to avoid airstrikes .
The anti-ISIS alliance that the United States is putting together risks driving more terrorist organizations to join forces with al-Baghdadi 's group in what they perceive as a `` crusader '' war against Muslims , al-Hashimi said .
Influential Middle Eastern countries such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia may be crucial in countering that view .
`` Help is needed from Saudi and Egyptian religious scholars in fighting ideology with ideology , '' al-Hashimi said . `` This is key to extracting ISIS from the roots . ''
Last week , Egypt 's grand mufti reportedly condemned ISIS , saying that its actions are not in line with Islam .
A member of the Saudi royal family told CNN on Monday that he did n't think his country would participate in military operations but would be pleased to see ISIS vanquished in response to its heinous violence .
`` I think that with each killing that takes place , unfortunately , every time hopefully the world community will be more united in really eradicating this disease that 's really infecting the whole Middle Eastern region and inevitably will be contagious to other countries in the world , '' Prince Alwaleed bin Talal said .
If Obama sticks to the goal of defeating the Islamist extremists , the move will help restore Saudi Arabia 's trust in Washington , which has been shaken over the crisis in Syria , he said .
Al-Hashimi said he is concerned by the exclusion of Iran -- arguably the most influential player in Iraq -- from the coalition .
`` They sidelined Iran , and that is a very big mistake because Iran controls the Shiite militias in Iraq and these militias could sabotage military operations when it comes to logistical support or can threaten the safety of American advisers and trainers , '' he said .","Story highlights U.S. airstrikes target ISIS militants near Iraqi capital

ISIS beheaded another Westerner, a British aid worker. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry courted Middle Eastern leaders to join a coalition in the fight against the Islamist militants. And U.S. planes aimed at ISIS fighters near Iraq's capital.

As world leaders struggled Monday to come up with strategies against ISIS just days after a high-profile beheading by the Islamist militants, the U.S. military targeted an ISIS position near Baghdad.

A statement from U.S. Central Command described the action as ""the first strike taken as part of our expanded efforts beyond protecting our own people and humanitarian missions to hit (ISIS) targets as Iraqi forces go on offense, as outlined in the President's speech last Wednesday.""

An ISIS ""fighting position"" that was firing on Iraqi security forces southwest of Baghdad was destroyed, the statement said.

Meanwhile, more than two dozen nations, the Arab League, the European Union and United Nations met in the French capital, calling ISIS a threat to the international community and agreeing to ""ensure that the culprits are brought to justice.""

In a statement at the conference's conclusion, the French government said the participants had agreed to take on ISIS ""by any means necessary, including appropriate military assistance, in line with the needs expressed by the Iraqi authorities, in accordance with international law and without jeopardizing civilian security.""

French President François Hollande, who hosted the conference with his Iraqi counterpart, Fuad Masum, said there was ""no time to lose"" in international efforts against ISIS.

Meanwhile, the leader of Iraq's Kurdistan region asked for intensified U.S. airstrikes, saying he would welcome foreign fighters and urging Iran and the United States to set aside their differences to fight ISIS.

Latest beheading

ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, underlined its barbaric credentials over the weekend -- posting a video showing the beheading of British aid worker David Haines and threatening the life of another hostage from the United Kingdom.

It was the third videotaped killing of a Western hostage released in less than a month.

The latest killing, ISIS said, was ""a message to the allies of America"" -- a direct challenge to the United States.

President Barack Obama announced last week that the United States would lead ""a broad coalition to roll back this terrorist threat"" and that U.S. airstrikes against ISIS would expand from Iraq into Syria.

The United States has said nearly 40 nations have agreed to contribute to the fight against ISIS, which has seized control of large areas of northern Iraq and Syria. But it remains unclear exactly which countries are on that list and what roles they'll play.

Britain won't 'shirk our responsibility'

Britain's role in the coalition is in particular focus after the killing of Haines, who was abducted last year near a Syrian refugee camp where he was working.

Haines' death ""will not lead Britain to shirk our responsibility"" to work with allies to take on ISIS, British Prime Minister David Cameron said Sunday . Instead, he said, ""it must strengthen our resolve.""

Cameron pledged to work with the United States to support its ""direct military action."" He also emphasized that ""this is not about British troops on the ground.""

Killer identified?

Cameron has vowed to ""hunt down those responsible"" for Haines' killing and ""bring them to justice, no matter how long it takes.""

The situation is made all the more difficult by the fact that the man who appears in the video beheading Haines -- believed to be the same man previously shown killing American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff -- has a London accent.

Cameron knows the identity of the killer, CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen has reported, citing unidentified British officials. But authorities aren't making it public for ""operational reasons,"" Bergen writes in a commentary for CNN

Cameron knows that the man in the video holds at least two other American citizens as well as other hostages from additional Western countries, and that he is part of a larger group of British hostage-takers working for ISIS, Bergen reports.

""It is a real crisis for Cameron, and it underlines a sobering fact: British citizens have volunteered to go to Syria to fight at 25 times the rate that Americans have done so, when adjusted for population size,"" he writes.

Building a coalition

Kerry, who attended the Paris conference Monday, closed out a Middle Eastern trip on Saturday, seeking to win support for the U.S.-led anti-ISIS coalition.

In an interview that aired Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" Kerry said some nations ""are clearly prepared to take action in the air alongside the United States and to do airstrikes, if that's what they're called on to do,"" but he did not get more specific.

Britain has agreed to help arm Kurdish forces, support the Iraqi government, keep supplying humanitarian help and coordinate with the United Nations to battle ISIS.

France, meanwhile, began reconnaissance flights over Iraq, the French Defense Ministry said. Two Rafale air force planes took off from a base in the United Arab Emirates, it said.

Some nations have also offered to commit ground troops, but ""we are not looking for that at this moment anyway,"" Kerry said in the CBS interview.

Iraqi Kurdistan's President Masoud Barzani -- whose Peshmerga forces have taken a significant role in battling ISIS -- told CNN's Anna Coren on Monday that he has not asked for foreign fighters but would welcome them.

He also called on the United States to step up airstrikes and said Iran should play a role in battling ISIS. But that can only happen, he said, if Iran and the United States ""put their differences aside.""

Iran has rejected any cooperation with the United States to combat ISIS in Iraq, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei said on his Twitter account Monday. ""I rejected (the) US offer to Iran about ISIS, because US has corrupted its hands in this issue,"" the statement read.

Khamanei accused the United States of planning to use military action against ISIS to ""dominate the region.""

Analyst: Obama 'revealed too much'

A leading Iraqi expert on ISIS told CNN that Obama may already have revealed more about U.S. plans than he should have to the militant group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

""The mistake was announcing too much of the strategy, and this was a free gift to al-Baghdadi to prepare and counter what has been revealed,"" said Hisham al-Hashimi, who has studied jihadist groups and their evolution in Iraq over the past decade.

He suggested ISIS has already begun to take defensive measures, including moving weapons and ammunition into depots and putting elite fighters among civilian populations to avoid airstrikes.

The anti-ISIS alliance that the United States is putting together risks driving more terrorist organizations to join forces with al-Baghdadi's group in what they perceive as a ""crusader"" war against Muslims, al-Hashimi said.

'Fighting ideology with ideology'

Influential Middle Eastern countries such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia may be crucial in countering that view.

""Help is needed from Saudi and Egyptian religious scholars in fighting ideology with ideology,"" al-Hashimi said. ""This is key to extracting ISIS from the roots.""

Last week, Egypt's grand mufti reportedly condemned ISIS, saying that its actions are not in line with Islam.

A member of the Saudi royal family told CNN on Monday that he didn't think his country would participate in military operations but would be pleased to see ISIS vanquished in response to its heinous violence.

""I think that with each killing that takes place, unfortunately, every time hopefully the world community will be more united in really eradicating this disease that's really infecting the whole Middle Eastern region and inevitably will be contagious to other countries in the world,"" Prince Alwaleed bin Talal said.

If Obama sticks to the goal of defeating the Islamist extremists, the move will help restore Saudi Arabia's trust in Washington, which has been shaken over the crisis in Syria, he said.

Al-Hashimi said he is concerned by the exclusion of Iran -- arguably the most influential player in Iraq -- from the coalition.

""They sidelined Iran, and that is a very big mistake because Iran controls the Shiite militias in Iraq and these militias could sabotage military operations when it comes to logistical support or can threaten the safety of American advisers and trainers,"" he said.",www.cnn.com,left,Wd4U4edpRqbLpMi4

Ex-Marine caught up in David Petraeus scandal , but Defense Department cleared him
John Allen , the retired four-star Marine general and former commander of American forces in Afghanistan , will take on the role of coordinating the international coalition to battle ISIS , Secretary of State John Kerry announced Friday .
The move marks a return to the head of a difficult and challenging mission that bears no clear or obvious solutions for a successful outcome . Allen is a veteran of many of many of those .
Allen is certainly familiar with the rocky terrain he is about to enter having been one of the top commanders in western Iraq during the `` Sunni Awakening , '' a program that worked to turn Sunni tribes in Anbar province against the al Qaeda affiliate then operating in Iraq .
The militant organization now swallowing portions of both Syria and Iraq that President Barack Obama has vowed to destroy is the successor to what was once that al Qaeda group .

Allen graduated with honors from the U.S . Naval Academy in 1976 , and has racked up a long and distinguished list of accomplishments both on the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq as well as an attempted role as peacemaker to one of the longest and most intractable conflicts in the Middle East .
Obama tapped him in 2011 to take command of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan -- the NATO-led coalition of military forces in that country -- after Obama nominated Gen. David Petraeus , then that coalition 's commander , to become director of the CIA .
Allen was the first Marine tapped to head up the military effort in Afghanistan .
Kerry later appointed him to develop a security plan for Israel and the West Bank during negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians over the possibility of a future Palestinian state that eventually collapsed .
Before his command in Afghanistan , Allen was deputy commander at U.S. Central Command , which oversees all military operations in the Middle East .

Ex-Marine caught up in David Petraeus scandal, but Defense Department cleared him

John Allen, the retired four-star Marine general and former commander of American forces in Afghanistan, will take on the role of coordinating the international coalition to battle ISIS, Secretary of State John Kerry announced Friday.

The move marks a return to the head of a difficult and challenging mission that bears no clear or obvious solutions for a successful outcome. Allen is a veteran of many of many of those.

Allen is certainly familiar with the rocky terrain he is about to enter having been one of the top commanders in western Iraq during the ""Sunni Awakening,"" a program that worked to turn Sunni tribes in Anbar province against the al Qaeda affiliate then operating in Iraq.

The militant organization now swallowing portions of both Syria and Iraq that President Barack Obama has vowed to destroy is the successor to what was once that al Qaeda group.

Allen graduated with honors from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1976, and has racked up a long and distinguished list of accomplishments both on the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq as well as an attempted role as peacemaker to one of the longest and most intractable conflicts in the Middle East.

Obama tapped him in 2011 to take command of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan -- the NATO-led coalition of military forces in that country -- after Obama nominated Gen. David Petraeus, then that coalition's commander, to become director of the CIA.

Allen was the first Marine tapped to head up the military effort in Afghanistan.

Kerry later appointed him to develop a security plan for Israel and the West Bank during negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians over the possibility of a future Palestinian state that eventually collapsed.

Before his command in Afghanistan, Allen was deputy commander at U.S. Central Command, which oversees all military operations in the Middle East.

He is also a decorated veteran of the armed forces, having received the Defense Distinguished Service Medal and the Defense Superior Service Medal among others.

While controversy mostly eluded his impressive rise to the top ranks of the U.S. military, Allen was briefly caught up in the 2012 scandal involving Petraeus' infidelity that ultimately led the widely admired retired general to resign his CIA post.

An investigation into ""flirtatious"" email exchanges between Allen and Jill Kelley , the Florida woman whose complaints about threatening emails from Petraeus' mistress, Paula Broadwell, brought the scandal into the public, led Allen to withdraw his nomination by Obama to become NATO's supreme allied commander in 2013.

The Defense Department eventually cleared him of any wrongdoing, and Allen retired from the Marines

This was the speech President Barack Obama never thought he’d have to give.

Standing in front of the cameras in prime time, Obama — the man who won the White House in part because of his opposition to the Iraq War — prepared the country to get even more deeply enmeshed in the violent part of the world he’s spent much of his presidency trying to get out of.

More support troops and bomber jets are going to Iraq. The option to start blowing things up in Syria is now officially very much real. And though Obama called upon Arab nations to take more responsibility for “their region,” he made clear that America is not coming close to leaving the Middle East for the rest of his presidency, and probably not for a bunch of future presidencies either.

Then he did something he rarely does: instead of anchoring his plan in a pragmatic, measured view of America’s redefined role in a contemporary world, he appealed to an exceptionalist ideal: “American leadership is the one constant in an uncertain world,” he said. “Our endless blessings bestow an enduring burden.”

That section was tacked onto the end of Obama’s short speech, right after he finished laying out the four major plans of his proposal to combat ISIL — making sure to land on, “so this is our strategy.” It was hard not to hear an echo of George W. Bush, and the vision of America as a beacon of freedom around the world that he often spoke of and let shape decisions.

Obama tended to treat that approach as not caught up with reality. And though he’s referred to America’s role in the world as “indispensable” before, not until Wednesday night did he so thoroughly embrace that grand vision of America and anchor American foreign policy to it.

isis,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/11/obama-asks-congress-military-force-authorization/,Obama confounds Congress with vague Islamic State war powers request,2015-02-11,Ben Wolfgang,"Confidently declaring that the Islamic State “ is going to lose , ” President Obama on Wednesday asked Congress for broad yet intentionally vague war powers as he laid the foundation for a three-year military campaign against the terrorist group that ultimately could involve U.S. ground troops .
By leaving a host of unanswered questions with its authorization for use of military force , called AUMF on Capitol Hill , the White House is placing a significant burden on congressional leaders who now must hammer out the details .
Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have voiced serious concerns . Democrats fear the authorization may open the door to another long , bloody ground war in the Middle East , and Republicans say Mr. Obama is unnecessarily tying his own hands and taking a bizarre step by giving up some power in his role as commander in chief .
As he announced the plan in a White House speech Wednesday afternoon , Mr. Obama said the U.S. and its allies have made significant progress in halting the advance of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or ISIL , through Iraq and Syria . Now , he wants the blessing of Congress to finish the job .
“ Make no mistake — this is a difficult mission and it will remain difficult for some time . It ’ s going to take time to dislodge these terrorists , especially from urban areas . But our coalition is on the offensive .

Opening himself to such criticism wasn ’ t legally necessary , the president said .
He said the White House does not need a new authorization for use of military force to continue operations against the Islamic State because it has the necessary authority from 2002 on Iraq and a 2001 document allowing the U.S. to pursue those responsible for the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
The proposal he submitted Wednesday would repeal the 2002 authorization but would leave the 2001 authorization on the books . The administration , lawmakers and outside groups have said it is time to either repeal or rewrite the broad 2001 authorization , which Mr. Obama has used as legal justification for the air campaign against the Islamic State that began in August .
It is unclear how quickly the authorization will work its way through Congress and what it will look like when it leaves Capitol Hill .

“ We will quickly begin to hold rigorous hearings where the administration will have an opportunity to provide Congress and the American people greater clarity on the U.S. strategy to address ISIS , particularly in Syria , ” Mr. Corker said in a statement .
Leaders of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said they planned to hold a hearing Thursday to begin consideration of the strategy to combat the Islamic State , though no administration witnesses were expected .
Sen. Tim Kaine , Virginia Democrat , said he expects hearings to focus on the president ’ s strategy to defeat the Islamic State as much as the language of the authorization , including taking a look at the contributions to the fight from partners in the region .

Speaker John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican , said the president ’ s plan takes too many options off the table to give military leaders the resources they need to defeat the Islamic State .
“ Any authorization for the use of military force must give our military commanders the flexibility and authorities they need to succeed and protect our people , ” he said in a statement . “ While I believe an AUMF against ISIL is important , I have concerns that the president ’ s request does not meet this standard . ”
Other Republicans worry that the narrowness of the authorization would unnecessarily restrict presidential powers as commander in chief .
“ He should explain why he is seeking to tie his own hands by limiting authority that he ’ s already claimed , ” said Rep. Mac Thornberry , Texas Republican and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee .
Despite the array of concerns , lawmakers in both parties support the idea of giving the president formal authority to wage war on the Islamic State , which is directly responsible for the deaths of at least four Americans . James Foley , Steven Sotloff , Peter Kassig and , most recently , Kayla Mueller , have died in the custody of the group .
Members of Congress are optimistic that Mr. Obama ultimately will be granted the power he seeks .
“ There are enough variables here where we should be able to reach a consensus , ” said Rep. Adam B. Schiff , California Democrat .
Congress in recent times has rarely denied presidents the authority to use military force , though there are high-profile examples where lawmakers said “ no . ”
Two years ago , it appeared Mr. Obama wouldn ’ t get permission to intervene in the Syrian civil war because lawmakers were skeptical about the broader U.S. plan and the trustworthiness of Syrian rebel groups .
In 1999 , Congress refused to give President Clinton authority to conduct airstrikes in Kosovo . Mr. Clinton went ahead with U.S. military action anyway , sparking a lawsuit by members of Congress .
Although it appears unlikely that Mr. Obama ’ s authorization will meet a similar fate , analysts say Congress has problems to fix , including the three-year time frame .
“ I would expect the enemy to fashion a specific strategy to exploit the deadline . That is , one where they aim to simply hunker down and continue to exist with the anticipation that three years from now political will might be so exhausted as to make reauthorization problematic , ” said Charles Dunlap , a retired Air Force general and executive director of the Center on Law , Ethics and National Security at Duke University School of Law .","Confidently declaring that the Islamic State “is going to lose,” President Obama on Wednesday asked Congress for broad yet intentionally vague war powers as he laid the foundation for a three-year military campaign against the terrorist group that ultimately could involve U.S. ground troops.

By leaving a host of unanswered questions with its authorization for use of military force, called AUMF on Capitol Hill, the White House is placing a significant burden on congressional leaders who now must hammer out the details.

Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have voiced serious concerns. Democrats fear the authorization may open the door to another long, bloody ground war in the Middle East, and Republicans say Mr. Obama is unnecessarily tying his own hands and taking a bizarre step by giving up some power in his role as commander in chief.

As he announced the plan in a White House speech Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Obama said the U.S. and its allies have made significant progress in halting the advance of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, through Iraq and Syria. Now, he wants the blessing of Congress to finish the job.

“Make no mistake — this is a difficult mission and it will remain difficult for some time. It’s going to take time to dislodge these terrorists, especially from urban areas. But our coalition is on the offensive. ISIL is on the defensive, and ISIL is going to lose,” Mr. Obama said in a brief address. “Our coalition is strong, our cause is just and our mission will succeed. And long after the terrorists we face today are destroyed and forgotten, America will continue to stand free and tall and strong.”

The authorization for use of military force, the first since the 2002 document authorizing the Iraq War, calls for the systematic destruction of the Islamic State and any person or group associated with it.

The authorization would last through 2018, giving the U.S. and its allies three years to dismantle the radical terrorist organization, though the time frame could be extended.

It contains no geographic boundaries, allowing the president to dispatch U.S. planes or special forces to every corner of the globe to hunt down Islamic State fighters.

The authorization prohibits “enduring offensive ground combat operations,” but there is confusion about exactly what that term means. Mr. Obama stressed that he won’t commit the U.S. to another all-out ground war but made clear that he will use special operations forces to target Islamic State leaders when necessary.

“If we had actionable intelligence about a gathering of ISIL leaders and our partners didn’t have the capacity to get them, I would be prepared to order our special forces to take action,” he said.

White House officials said ground forces could be used in defensive operations, for example if Islamic State fighters move on Baghdad.

isis,Vox,0,http://www.vox.com/2015/5/18/8620367/ramadi-isis,ISIS just won its biggest victory in Iraq in almost a year,2015-05-18,"Zack Beauchamp, Umair Irfan, Ella Nilsen, Sara Morrison, Rani Molla, Alex Abad-Santos, Jen Kirby","On Sunday , after prolonged fighting in the Iraqi city of Ramadi , ISIS troops pushed out government forces and took control of the city . Ramadi is the provincial capital of Iraq 's western Anbar province , making this the biggest ISIS victory in Iraq in nearly a year .
This has significance beyond even just Ramadi : it shows the fundamental weakness of the Iraqi military and its deep dependence on radical Shia militias . It also shows that the campaign to defeat ISIS in Iraq , even if it still looks likely to succeed in the long run , will be a long , hard slog .
ISIS has for some time been unusually successful in Anbar province , which is mostly Sunni , blocking Iraqi army attacks and at times pushing forward even as they are set back in the rest of the country . Recently , the balance in Anbar has shifting in favor of ISIS — as the fall of Ramadi proves .
Iraq 's Ramadi contingent has been underresourced for over a year . `` Brave Iraqi troops had held out [ in Ramadi ] for 16 months , with little help , before crumbling , '' Liz Sly , the Washington Post 's Beirut bureau chief , writes .
This is the Iraqi army 's core problem : profoundly weakened by corruption and mass defections during last June 's ISIS offensive , it just does n't have enough effective , battle-hardened units to take on ISIS on its own . Even an Iraqi elite special forces unit deployed to Ramadi , the Golden Division , was defeated because it 's `` a small force stretched over a dozen battlefields , fighting nonstop [ for ] a year , '' according to Michael Knights , the Lafer fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy .
This fundamental weakness forces the Iraqi army to rely on allies : the Kurdish peshmerga in the north and violent sectarian Shia militias in the rest of the country . Together , their combined forces are much stronger than ISIS : both the Kurds and the militias have proven very effective against ISIS on the battlefield . But the factions are also at odds with one another . Some of the most influential Shia militias have political wings that are political rivals of Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi 's Dawa party , for example .
The militias were n't fighting in Ramadi when it fell : Abadi wanted the army to beat ISIS , and the United States was worried about the militias ' track record of brutalizing Sunni civilians . So they hoped they could hold back ISIS there without the use of Shia militias , and that failed .
Now Anbar 's Sunni-dominated provincial council has formally requested militia assistance — which is on the way . `` More forces , including local forces , is the only solution '' in Ramadi , Knights writes . The militias are `` the only speedy mechanism left . ''
ISIS 's victory in Ramadi has n't changed the fundamentals of the conflict : ISIS is still likely to lose its territory in Iraq . The militant group remains outnumbered , surrounded by enemies , vulnerable to American airstrikes , and facing increasingly competent enemies .
But this campaign will not be easy , nor will it be short . ISIS has a remarkably effective combat force given its size and resources . The Iraqi army is indeed more competent than it was during its disastrous performance early in the conflict , but it still has a long way to go . And the deep political divides between the Iraqi army forces and the militia leadership are n't going away , and could lead to a different sort of conflict after ISIS .
The anti-ISIS campaign , then , will likely have more setbacks like this one . This fighting will continue to devastate Iraq and potentially deepen the Sunni-Shia divides that gave rise to ISIS in the first place . Even with ISIS 's fundamental weakness , Iraq is still in a very bad place .","On Sunday, after prolonged fighting in the Iraqi city of Ramadi, ISIS troops pushed out government forces and took control of the city. Ramadi is the provincial capital of Iraq's western Anbar province, making this the biggest ISIS victory in Iraq in nearly a year.

This has significance beyond even just Ramadi: it shows the fundamental weakness of the Iraqi military and its deep dependence on radical Shia militias. It also shows that the campaign to defeat ISIS in Iraq, even if it still looks likely to succeed in the long run, will be a long, hard slog.

Ramadi shows the Iraqi army's problems

ISIS has for some time been unusually successful in Anbar province, which is mostly Sunni, blocking Iraqi army attacks and at times pushing forward even as they are set back in the rest of the country. Recently, the balance in Anbar has shifting in favor of ISIS — as the fall of Ramadi proves.

Iraq's Ramadi contingent has been underresourced for over a year. ""Brave Iraqi troops had held out [in Ramadi] for 16 months, with little help, before crumbling,"" Liz Sly, the Washington Post's Beirut bureau chief, writes.

This is the Iraqi army's core problem: profoundly weakened by corruption and mass defections during last June's ISIS offensive, it just doesn't have enough effective, battle-hardened units to take on ISIS on its own. Even an Iraqi elite special forces unit deployed to Ramadi, the Golden Division, was defeated because it's ""a small force stretched over a dozen battlefields, fighting nonstop [for] a year,"" according to Michael Knights, the Lafer fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

This fundamental weakness forces the Iraqi army to rely on allies: the Kurdish peshmerga in the north and violent sectarian Shia militias in the rest of the country. Together, their combined forces are much stronger than ISIS: both the Kurds and the militias have proven very effective against ISIS on the battlefield. But the factions are also at odds with one another. Some of the most influential Shia militias have political wings that are political rivals of Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's Dawa party, for example.

The militias weren't fighting in Ramadi when it fell: Abadi wanted the army to beat ISIS, and the United States was worried about the militias' track record of brutalizing Sunni civilians. So they hoped they could hold back ISIS there without the use of Shia militias, and that failed.

Now Anbar's Sunni-dominated provincial council has formally requested militia assistance — which is on the way. ""More forces, including local forces, is the only solution"" in Ramadi, Knights writes. The militias are ""the only speedy mechanism left.""

The campaign to defeat ISIS will be very hard

ISIS's victory in Ramadi hasn't changed the fundamentals of the conflict: ISIS is still likely to lose its territory in Iraq. The militant group remains outnumbered, surrounded by enemies, vulnerable to American airstrikes, and facing increasingly competent enemies.

But this campaign will not be easy, nor will it be short. ISIS has a remarkably effective combat force given its size and resources. The Iraqi army is indeed more competent than it was during its disastrous performance early in the conflict, but it still has a long way to go. And the deep political divides between the Iraqi army forces and the militia leadership aren't going away, and could lead to a different sort of conflict after ISIS.

The anti-ISIS campaign, then, will likely have more setbacks like this one. This fighting will continue to devastate Iraq and potentially deepen the Sunni-Shia divides that gave rise to ISIS in the first place. Even with ISIS's fundamental weakness, Iraq is still in a very bad place.",www.vox.com,left,ohveIbVk7GxgQb60

Yesterday Paris was rocketed by an explosion outside the France versus Germany soccer match, forcing the President of the Republic to be evacuated. Terrorists then machine gun attacked the Bataclan concert hall and a number of Paris cafés.





At France's largest airport, Charles De Gualle, the arrival hall was left virtually empty as flights reported half their inbound passengers had decided not to bother travelling. On one flight from Manchester (UK) passengers were delayed because so few travelers had turned up the weight and fuel calculations had to be completely redone.

`` We 're moving ahead with our strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist organization , '' Obama said in his weekly radio and online address .
The president 's language was almost identical to what he said Wednesday when he told the country in a prime-time TV address that the United States would launch direct air strikes in Iraq on the terror group and that he has OK ’ d such strikes in Syria , as part of a broader counter-terrorism effort with allies .
However , conflicting and at times seemingly evolving messages from top U.S. officials since the address has sparked concern about the president 's exact goals toward destroying the Islamic State , which has made a surprising and deadly rise to power in Syria and Iraq over the past several months .
The administration appears to be trying to find the exact message to appeal to Americans concerned about the U.S. getting involved in another Middle East conflict after the Iraq War and the war in Afghanistan . A Reuters/Ipsos poll released Friday shows support for the air strikes but little backing for a years-long air campaign or sending soldiers into the region .
Roughly 64 percent of those polled online said they backed the strikes . However , support dropped to 53 percent if the strikes were to last two or three years , and only 9 percent of those surveyed backed sending American troops to fight the terror group , according to the poll .
The White House and Pentagon acknowledged Friday that the U.S. `` is at war '' with the Islamic State -- contradicting statements Thursday by Secretary of State John Kerry , prompting criticism from Capitol Hill Republicans about the administration appearing to downplay the conflict .
White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest and Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby used almost identical language when pressed by reporters about whether the expanded military operation against the terrorist group is in fact a war .
`` In the same way that the United States is at war with Al Qaeda and its affiliates … the United States is at war with ISIL , '' Earnest said .
Kirby said : `` This is not the Iraq War '' from a decade ago `` but make no mistake -- we know we are at war with ISIL in the same way we are at war and continue to be at war with Al Qaeda and its affiliates . ''
On Thursday , Kerry described the military effort as `` very significant '' and a `` major counter-terrorism operation , '' but said `` war is the wrong terminology . ''
In addition , State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said she would not refer to U.S. efforts as part of the `` war on terrorism . ''
Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain and other lawmakers suggested Kerry ’ s comments did not square with Obama ’ s stated goal of defeating the growing terror network .
`` Then what was the president talking about [ Wednesday ] night ? '' McCain said Thursday .
Senior State Department officials told Fox News on Friday that Kerry 's comments were consistent with what other senior U.S. officials were saying at the time and made clear that the secretary remains on the same page as the rest of the administration .
`` This was a deliberate , administration-wide adjustment in language , '' a senior State Department official said , `` which Secretary Kerry would have also used today had he been asked . ''
House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul , R-Texas , said Friday that the semantics over what to call the operation “ weakens the mission . ”
Obama said Saturday : “ The best way to defeat a group like ISIL isn ’ t by sending large numbers of American combat forces to wage a ground war in the heart of the Middle East . That wouldn ’ t serve our interests . In fact , it would only risk fueling extremism even more . ”","President Obama on Saturday restated his plan to destroy Islamic State but did not say the United States ""is at war"" with the Middle East terror group, creating more uncertainty what exactly is the U.S. mission.

""We're moving ahead with our strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist organization,"" Obama said in his weekly radio and online address.

The president's language was almost identical to what he said Wednesday when he told the country in a prime-time TV address that the United States would launch direct air strikes in Iraq on the terror group and that he has OK’d such strikes in Syria, as part of a broader counter-terrorism effort with allies.

However, conflicting and at times seemingly evolving messages from top U.S. officials since the address has sparked concern about the president's exact goals toward destroying the Islamic State, which has made a surprising and deadly rise to power in Syria and Iraq over the past several months.

In an interview that aired Sunday on NBC 's `` Meet the Press , '' Obama expressed confidence that the United States , with help from regional partners , will be able to wipe out the terror organization .
`` I just want the American people to understand the nature of the threat and how we 're going to deal with it and to have confidence that we 'll be able to deal with it , '' the President told interviewer Chuck Todd .
He said action will include military , diplomatic and economic components . He laid out a three-stage plan that starts with actions the U.S. has already taken : gathering increased intelligence on ISIS , and using airstrikes to protect American personnel , critical Iraqi infrastructure like the Mosul Dam , and cities such as Irbil in Iraqi Kurdistan .

`` The next phase is now to start going on some offense , '' he said . `` We have to get an Iraqi government in place , and I 'm optimistic that next week we should be able to get that done . ''
He said his speech wo n't announce the involvement of U.S. ground troops . `` We 're not looking at sending 100,000 American troops , '' he vowed .
The President gave his most direct and detailed assessment of ISIS since the terrorist group has brutally decapitated two American journalists and killed thousands of Iraqis . It is a vastly different message than he gave nearly two weeks ago , when he said the U.S. did n't have a strategy `` yet '' to deal with ISIS in Syria , and in January , when he called it and other groups the JV team .
`` Well , they 're not a JV team , '' Obama said in Sunday 's `` Meet the Press '' interview .
The President received praise from recent critics who had said he was too timid as the scope , depth and capabilities of ISIS continue to grow .
`` I want to congratulate the President . He is now on offense , '' Sen. Dianne Feinstein , chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , said on CNN 's `` State of the Union . ''
`` It 's overdue , but the President is now there , '' the California Democrat added .

Congress returns to Washington this week from a five-week break and will immediately face questions about ISIS .

`` I 'm confident that I 've got the authorization that I need to protect the American people , '' he said .
But Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas , who is also considering a 2016 presidential run , said on ABC 's `` This Week '' that any additional military action `` should absolutely take congressional approval . ''
His colleagues in the House , however , did n't agree , saying the President has the constitutional authority to act without Congressional authorization .
The top Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee , Rep. Peter King , R-New York , said , `` I believe as commander in chief he has the absolute power to carry out these attacks . ''
Democratic Rep. Adam Smith of Washington agreed , saying the President does n't need authorization but that `` it would be better if Congress would authorize it . ''
He added , however , that it would be `` extraordinarily difficult '' to get through the partisan body , especially less than two months before an election .
While the U.S. plan to help Iraqi and Kurdish troops take back areas under ISIS control is key to defeating the militants , Obama said the strategy will also have economic and political prongs .
His plan will involve working to `` attract back Sunni tribes that may have felt that they had no connection to a Baghdad government that was ignoring their grievances . ''
As for the military , he insisted U.S. troops will not take the lead .
`` We do n't have the resources '' to `` occupy '' numerous countries , he said , so a more `` sustainable strategy ... means the boots on the ground have to be Iraqi . ''
But what 's unclear still is if he will authorize airstrikes in Syria .
ISIS gained power and strength there trying to defeat Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in that country 's complex civil war , and foreign policy hawks have been pushing for the U.S. to strike ISIS command centers and weapons stockpiles .
Obama did n't indicate in the interview aired Sunday whether he was going to move forward with airstrikes but said the U.S. will `` need to put more resources '' into vetted groups that oppose both al-Assad and ISIS in Syria .
`` We 're going to have to develop a moderate Sunni opposition that can control territory and that we can work with , '' he said , insisting there will be no U.S. troops on the ground . `` The notion that the United States should be putting boots on the ground , I think , would be a profound mistake . And I want to be very clear and very explicit about that . ''
`` The boots on the ground have to be Syrian , '' he added .
The U.S. has no plans to move forward alone . After a NATO summit in Wales last week , the President announced the support of nine countries that are committed to pushing back against ISIS . He said his next effort will be to obtain the support of allies in the region . Secretary of State John Kerry is going to spend the upcoming week attempting to gain support from Saudi Arabia , Jordan , Turkey and the United Arab Emirates , the President said .
The President maintains that the terror group , which gained power in war-torn Syria and expanded into Iraq , is not an immediate threat to the U.S . But he noted that `` over time '' it could become a `` serious threat to the homeland '' if it is able to continue to expand territory under its control while amassing arms and fighters , especially Western fighters .
Wednesday 's speech , which will come a day before the anniversary of the September 11 , 2001 , attacks , will help the American public better grasp the administration 's plan , he said .
`` What I want people to understand is that over the course of months , we are going to be able to not just blunt the momentum of ( ISIS ) , we are going to systematically degrade their capabilities , we 're going to shrink the territory that they control and ultimately , we 're going to defeat them , '' Obama said .","(CNN) President Barack Obama will address the country Wednesday to explain to the nation ""what our game plan is going forward"" in the fight against ISIS.

Earlier Thursday , at least one person had been arrested and charged with terrorism offenses and another 14 were detained as police conducted more than two dozen searches in Sydney , acting Federal Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin said at a news conference .
Hours later , police said nine people who were detained have been released .
A 24-year-old man from Merrylands has been charged with possession of ammunition without a license and unauthorized possession of a prohibited weapon , authorities said . Another man has also stood in court , charged with conspiracy to commit acts in preparation of a terrorist act and financing terrorism , police said , and two women were issued notices to appear later in court . Their names have not been released .
Authorities declined to give details about the threat , citing an ongoing operation .
But Abbott told reporters that intelligence revealed that Islamic militants inside Australia were planning to kill .
`` The exhortations , quite direct exhortations , were coming from an Australian who is apparently quite senior in ISIL ( Islamic State ) to networks of support back in Australia to conduct demonstration killings here in this country , '' he said .
More than 800 law enforcement officials fanned out across Sydney suburbs as part of a coordinated operation to serve 25 search warrants .
`` Today 's operation reflects the reality of the threat we actually face , '' said Andrew Scipione , commissioner of New South Wales Police .
A second series of searches were carried out in Brisbane , Scipione said . Those searches were connected to the arrests earlier this month of two men in Brisbane accused of recruiting and financing foreign fighters to Syria .
The commissioner said authorities are looking for links between the Sydney operation and the one in Brisbane .
Meanwhile , police presence has been increased at Parliament because of security threats , Abbott told Channel 7 on Friday .
Citing an intelligence review carried out in recent days , Abbott said federal police will be taking over security inside and outside of Parliament .
Australia last week raised its terror alert level to `` high '' for the first time since the national alert system was introduced in 2003 . It 's the second-highest alert level .
According to the four-level system , a reading of `` high '' means a terrorist attack is likely .
The decision to raise the level was foreshadowed by the departing director-general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization ( ASIO ) last week .
David Irvine said the threat level had been building in Australia over the last year , due to the increasing influence of Australian jihadists who had gone to fight for ISIS in the Middle East and then returned home .
According to the Sydney Morning Herald , Irvine said more than 20 Australians had returned home after fighting in Iraq or Syria , and about 60 Australians are currently fighting with extremist groups .
This week , the Australian government was one of 40 nations that agreed to contribute to the fight against ISIS , the terror group that calls itself the Islamic State .
The government has agreed to send military advisers to Iraq , and it will deploy a number of aircraft , including fighter jets , to the United Arab Emirates . It also will also help to stem the humanitarian crisis .
Australian combat troops will not participate in ground fighting , according to Abbott .","Story highlights Security ramped up at Parliament, PM Tony Abbott says

Police say charges were filed against two men

Abbott says intelligence pointed to possible ""demonstration killing"" by militants

Two men were charged Thursday in connection with a terror plot that Australia's prime minister said involved plans to carry out a public execution.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott said authorities obtained intelligence about a ""demonstration killing"" -- a killing, Australian media reported, in which alleged assailants planned to kidnap a member of the public, behead the victim and then drape him or her in an ISIS flag.

The foiled plot comes just days after the country raised its terror alert to high and in the midst of Australia committing to helping the United States and a broad international coalition to beat back the Islamic State, or ISIS.

The militant group has been slaughtering people and taking over villages in Syria and Iraq. One of its members beheaded two Western journalists and an aid worker -- brutality that was videotaped and broadcast throughout the world. ISIS vows that it will stop at nothing to create a caliphate governed by the intensely strict Sharia law.

Earlier Thursday, at least one person had been arrested and charged with terrorism offenses and another 14 were detained as police conducted more than two dozen searches in Sydney, acting Federal Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin said at a news conference.

Hours later, police said nine people who were detained have been released.

A 24-year-old man from Merrylands has been charged with possession of ammunition without a license and unauthorized possession of a prohibited weapon, authorities said. Another man has also stood in court, charged with conspiracy to commit acts in preparation of a terrorist act and financing terrorism, police said, and two women were issued notices to appear later in court. Their names have not been released.

Authorities declined to give details about the threat, citing an ongoing operation.

But Abbott told reporters that intelligence revealed that Islamic militants inside Australia were planning to kill.

""The exhortations, quite direct exhortations, were coming from an Australian who is apparently quite senior in ISIL (Islamic State) to networks of support back in Australia to conduct demonstration killings here in this country,"" he said.

Early morning raids

More than 800 law enforcement officials fanned out across Sydney suburbs as part of a coordinated operation to serve 25 search warrants.

""Today's operation reflects the reality of the threat we actually face,"" said Andrew Scipione, commissioner of New South Wales Police.

A second series of searches were carried out in Brisbane, Scipione said. Those searches were connected to the arrests earlier this month of two men in Brisbane accused of recruiting and financing foreign fighters to Syria.

The commissioner said authorities are looking for links between the Sydney operation and the one in Brisbane.

Meanwhile, police presence has been increased at Parliament because of security threats, Abbott told Channel 7 on Friday.

Citing an intelligence review carried out in recent days, Abbott said federal police will be taking over security inside and outside of Parliament.

Terror alert raised to 'high'

Australia last week raised its terror alert level to ""high"" for the first time since the national alert system was introduced in 2003. It's the second-highest alert level.

According to the four-level system, a reading of ""high"" means a terrorist attack is likely.

The decision to raise the level was foreshadowed by the departing director-general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO) last week.

David Irvine said the threat level had been building in Australia over the last year, due to the increasing influence of Australian jihadists who had gone to fight for ISIS in the Middle East and then returned home.

According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Irvine said more than 20 Australians had returned home after fighting in Iraq or Syria, and about 60 Australians are currently fighting with extremist groups.

Australia joins anti-terror coalition

This week, the Australian government was one of 40 nations that agreed to contribute to the fight against ISIS, the terror group that calls itself the Islamic State.

The government has agreed to send military advisers to Iraq, and it will deploy a number of aircraft, including fighter jets, to the United Arab Emirates. It also will also help to stem the humanitarian crisis.

Australian combat troops will not participate in ground fighting, according to Abbott.",www.cnn.com,left,DIEUS7A4bURzCPNi

Islamic State militants launched a fierce attack Wednesday to capture the city of Ramadi, dealing a setback to a newly launched Iraqi military offensive in the Sunni-dominated region.

Sunni tribal leaders who have been holding out in the city, 70 miles west of Baghdad, said they were short of weapons and ammunition and were under intense pressure from the extremists, said Sterling Jensen, an assistant professor at the United Arab Emirates' National Defense College in Abu Dhabi. Jensen keeps in close contact with tribal leaders.

An Iraqi Defense Ministry spokesman, Brig. Gen. Tahseen Ibrahim, acknowledged that the militants ""gained a foothold in some areas"" in Anbar Province, the Associated Press reported.

He said reinforcements were dispatched to the province. ""The situation is under control and the standoff will be resolved in the coming hours,"" he told the AP.

U.S. Central Command said the Iraqi government remains in control of Ramadi, Anbar's provincial capital.

The fighting came as Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi was visiting Washington, where he asked for additional U.S. support in his government's fight against the Islamic State.

The Pentagon said Monday that Iraq's armed forces, backed by U.S. airstrikes, reclaimed about 25% of the territory that had been captured last year by the Islamic State.

Iraqi residents said militants captured the villages of Sjariyah, Albu-Ghanim and Soufiya, giving them a foothold to launch an attack into the city, the AP reported.

The fighting in Anbar is a key test for Iraq's military goal to push the militants out of the country. Iraq's leaders decided to make a push in Anbar, located along the main roads linking Baghdad to the Syrian border, before launching an offensive into Mosul, Iraq's second largest city. The militants entered Iraq from Syria, where they have been fighting to overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad.

""Ramadi is vital for liberating Mosul,"" Jensen said.

Some residents of Anbar sided with the Islamic State militants because they are fellow Sunnis and have been alienated by Iraq's Shiite-dominated government. Other tribes fought against the militants and complained that Baghdad's central government did not provide them with enough support.

Washington has encouraged the Iraqi government to provide the Sunni tribes with arms and other support to carry out the fight against the extremists.

""Baghdad is not speaking realistically about what's happening and what it claims to be doing for Sunni fighters,"" Jensen said.

Meanwhile, al-Abadi expressed worry Wednesday about the conflict in Yemen, saying his government is ""uneasy"" about U.S. military support for Saudi Arabia, which is carrying out airstrikes against Shiite rebels there.

For example , at a furthest point of a Pershmerga advance , overlooking Islamic State strongholds below , the light machine gun used by the Peshmerga was 50 years old .
A senior Peshmerga military officer spoke to ███ about the need for modern weapons , ammunition and equipment : “ The weapons that we have now are all old Russian built weapons . As is usually the case for old weapons , they do not work properly . They break down . We don ’ t have anything else to use , so we have to use them. ” Their sniper rifle is from the 60 ’ s and 70 ’ s . The older they get the less reliable they are . ”
Another top Peshmerga Commander told ███ , “ ISIS has 6 Divisions of American-made weapons that the Iraqi Army lost. ” He said that the Iraqi Army sells their weapons to the Islamic State for nothing , “ like a pair of pants , ” in order to survive .
“ If we had the weapons , it would be over , ” said the Commander . He added that when the Peshmerga enter villages , the Islamic State fear them despite their superior weapons . While the Peshmerga have received some light weapons , he noted it was not enough to make a difference .
Seven countries have promised to supply weapons to the Kurds to help fight the Islamic State . Several countries have already delivered arms and military equipment , including Britain , France , Germany and Albania . Rudaw news reported that Peshmerga Minister Mustafa Sayid Qadir said that his forces are using foreign-supplied arms in their daily fight against the Islamic State ( IS ) . He told Rudaw “ What we have received so far are medium-sized weapons…we have sent it all to the units and command centers. ” Before the Peshmerga can use the equipment and supplies out in the field , they have to receive training , so the majority of the foreign supplies still has either not been delivered or used in the field .
The Peshmerga officer said , “ if we had the weapons that the U.S. gave to Iraq , we wouldn ’ t be afraid of any of the countries around us — or Daash ( ISIS ) — and nobody would be able to take those weapons away from us . Daash is nothing if we had the modern weapons . We are not afraid of Daash at all. ” The U.S. has spent billions of dollars on military equipment and supplies for the Iraqi central government .
The Peshmerga recaptured 6 villages last night from Islamic State control and are retaking more territory everyday . The Peshmerga ’ s task of retaking a village is a complex and difficult situation on many fronts . After the Islamic State captures a village or town , they booby-trap the area with explosive devices to prevent the Peshmerga from entering . The Mosul Dam had over 25 explosives that the Peshmerga had to diffuse after they retook it from Islamic State jihadists . After retaking an area , the Peshmerga send in teams of explosive experts to clear the area ; which has resulted in many lives lost .
Another difficulty the Peshmerga encounter are the villagers joining the Islamic State and fighting against the Peshmerga . “ More Peshmerga have been killed by the Iraqi villagers that have accepted Daash ( ISIS ) , and are against the Kurds , than actually by Daash , ” said a Peshmerga Commander . Another Peshmerga officer spoke about a town near the Syrian border where the villagers killed members of the Peshmerga when they tried to liberate it from ISIS . “ Mosul is 90 % Daash ( ISIS ) , ” said a Peshmerga senior officer . “ Anybody who stayed at this point of time are with Daash…Some of the towns that Peshmerga were going into to retake , the villagers fought against the Peshmerga which complicates things . The people that stayed , fight against Peshmerga — the others have fled , ” he said .
The international community should implement a strategy of aerial bombings of towns and villages that ISIS has complete control over — including Mosul . The United States needs to use all the necessary force to decimate the Islamic State and use large aerial bombing in certain areas is necessary — and in some situations , the only option .
“ We are finding Chechens , Afghanis , Egyptians , Saudis , Syrians , Algerians , and Libyans with the majority being from Iraq and Syria , ” said a senior Peshmerga officer .
According to Rudaw news , the Peshmerga are recruiting Christians to join the fight against ISIS . General Aziz told Rudaw news “ the Kurdish Peshmerga Ministry has answered a call by Christian leaders to recruit members of the community to “ protect themselves and their areas . ”
Rudaw reported Aziz stated “ We ask the young people of the Chaldean and Assyrian [ communities ] to register themselves to serve in the ranks of the Peshmerga forces of Kurdistan. ” “ Whatever people group they are , we know that we have to protect them within our borders , because this is our land and we are all willing to die protecting it , ” said the Peshmerga officer .
When asked about the relationship with America , the senior Peshmerga officer said , “ We are ready to cooperate with America at any level to make our land and area safe . We would stand with America to see democracy anywhere in the world ; we would stand with America to fight terrorism anywhere in the world , and would stand shoulder to shoulder with America anywhere in the world . ”

But some experts say that this case may indicate just the opposite : that the militant group has no immediate interest in US targets .
Douglas McAuthur McCain of San Diego was killed over the weekend in a battle between rival Syrian rebel groups , reports NBC News . Free Syrian Army sources told NBC that Mr. McCain was fighting alongside IS forces ( formerly known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant , or ISIS ) , and was identified through both his passport , which he had been carrying , and distinctive tattoos .
Members of McCain 's family in Minneapolis , where he grew up , told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune that US officials informed McCain 's mother of his death on Monday . Kenyata McCain , a first cousin , said the family is upset and confused over his death and apparent ties to the terrorist group .
Kenyata McCain said she was in touch with Douglas McCain on Friday , and “ he was telling all of us he was in Turkey. ” She noted that his Facebook page indicated that he supported the terrorist group , also known as ISIS . “ I know that he had strong Muslim beliefs , ” she added , “ but I didn ’ t know that he was in support of ISIS . I didn ’ t think he would be . ”
According to a post on McCain 's Twitter account , he converted to Islam about 10 years ago , which he described as `` the best thing that ever happen to me . '' The Washington Post writes that McCain 's radicalization fits the pattern shown by other Westerners who became jihadi fighters , according to Richard Barrett , a former British intelligence officer now working for the Soufan Group , a security consulting firm .
Though every Western foreign fighter leaves for Syria for different reasons , McCain ’ s early life carries themes found among other foreign militants . They often operate somewhere on the fringes of society and feel excluded , wrote expert Richard Barrett of the Soufan Group . “ The French authorities categorize volunteers from France as disaffected , aimless and lacking a sense of identity or belonging , ” Barrett wrote in his report . “ This appears to be common across most nationalities and fits with the high number of converts , presumably people who are seeking a greater sense of purpose and meaning in their lives . ”
Mr. Barrett also told the Star-Tribune that McCain 's death does not indicate an immediate threat to the US . He notes that McCain 's use as a foot soldier by IS indicates that the group placed no particular value in his American identity , which could be useful for propaganda or for attacking US targets . It `` is further evidence that Americans are going there to fight for ISIS rather than to train as terrorists to attack at home , '' he said .

James Gelvin , a professor of Middle East history at the University of California-Los Angeles , told NBC News that the major appeal of IS for disaffected foreigners is that `` they 've been successful '' in Syria and Iraq . `` They have been able to take territory . Al Qaeda does n't take territory , '' he said .
But that very success could eventually drive away Americans and other foreigners , because once ISIS takes control in a region , it cracks down with a severe interpretation of Islam that quickly makes its leaders unpopular . `` Once you get to know them , you get to hate them , '' [ Mr. ] Gelvin said . While the threat of terrorist-trained Americans ' returning home is a serious concern — `` of course it is , '' he said — it 's more likely that any Americans who survive their battles in Iraq and Syria will return home discouraged and disillusioned , not dangerous .","The death of an American fighting in Syria for the self-declared Islamic State is heightening concerns about the radicalization of US citizens.

Free Syrian Army sources told NBC that Mr. McCain was fighting alongside IS forces (formerly known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, or ISIS), and was identified through both his passport, which he had been carrying, and distinctive tattoos.

Members of McCain's family in Minneapolis, where he grew up, told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune that US officials informed McCain's mother of his death on Monday. Kenyata McCain, a first cousin, said the family is upset and confused over his death and apparent ties to the terrorist group.

Kenyata McCain said she was in touch with Douglas McCain on Friday, and “he was telling all of us he was in Turkey.” She noted that his Facebook page indicated that he supported the terrorist group, also known as ISIS. “I know that he had strong Muslim beliefs,” she added, “but I didn’t know that he was in support of ISIS. I didn’t think he would be.”

According to a post on McCain's Twitter account, he converted to Islam about 10 years ago, which he described as ""the best thing that ever happen to me."" The Washington Post writes that McCain's radicalization fits the pattern shown by other Westerners who became jihadi fighters, according to Richard Barrett, a former British intelligence officer now working for the Soufan Group, a security consulting firm.

Though every Western foreign fighter leaves for Syria for different reasons, McCain’s early life carries themes found among other foreign militants. They often operate somewhere on the fringes of society and feel excluded, wrote expert Richard Barrett of the Soufan Group. “The French authorities categorize volunteers from France as disaffected, aimless and lacking a sense of identity or belonging,” Barrett wrote in his report. “This appears to be common across most nationalities and fits with the high number of converts, presumably people who are seeking a greater sense of purpose and meaning in their lives.”

Mr. Barrett also told the Star-Tribune that McCain's death does not indicate an immediate threat to the US. He notes that McCain's use as a foot soldier by IS indicates that the group placed no particular value in his American identity, which could be useful for propaganda or for attacking US targets. It ""is further evidence that Americans are going there to fight for ISIS rather than to train as terrorists to attack at home,"" he said.

James Gelvin, a professor of Middle East history at the University of California-Los Angeles, told NBC News that the major appeal of IS for disaffected foreigners is that ""they've been successful"" in Syria and Iraq. ""They have been able to take territory. Al Qaeda doesn't take territory,"" he said.

But that very success could eventually drive away Americans and other foreigners, because once ISIS takes control in a region, it cracks down with a severe interpretation of Islam that quickly makes its leaders unpopular. ""Once you get to know them, you get to hate them,"" [Mr.] Gelvin said. While the threat of terrorist-trained Americans' returning home is a serious concern — ""of course it is,"" he said — it's more likely that any Americans who survive their battles in Iraq and Syria will return home discouraged and disillusioned, not dangerous.

The Daschle legacy

One key figure here is Denis McDonough, who is unusual for a White House Chief of Staff in that he has a background that is primarily on foreign policy issues, and is unusual for a foreign policy specialist in having spent his formative years on Capitol Hill. When Barack Obama arrived in the Senate in 2005, he was in an unusually favorable position to attract talented congressional staff.

Authority without limits

In practice, however, that hard work put into the 2001 AUMF hasn't panned out McDonough and others who worked in congress to ensure the grant of authority was limited. Both the Bush and Obama administrations have used its legal authority to mount military campaigns not only in Afghanistan but across the border in Pakistan, and then around the world from Yemen to Somalia to Libya.

Osama bin Laden has been dead for years now.

Vaguely worded AUMFs, in that context, tilt the balance of power toward executive discretion and away from congressional involvement.

A step back

Obama's proposed ISIS AUMF doesn't alter the problematic 2001 AUMF. But it does take three important steps back from the brink of a forever war scenario.

It establishes the precedent that a new threat, such as ISIS, can and should be addressed with a new AUMF, rather than with more endless references to the 2001 AUMF.

It repeals the 2002 Iraq AUMF, which Bush sought separately from the 2001 resolution, establishing the precedent that these authorizations can and should be rescinded once their original purpose has expired.

In a way that neither of the Bush AUMFs did, it places limits both on the extent of what is authorized (no ""enduring offensive ground combat operations"") and the time for which it is authorized — with the AUMF automatically expiring after three years.

In a practical sense, of course, Obama's hands remain untied — which is part of why the debate is vexing to Congressional Democrats who'd rather deal with other things.

On Tuesday , the US and five Arab nations dropped more than 160 missiles and bombs inside Syria in the first round of what Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby called “ only the beginning ” of US-led strikes .
Additional airstrikes were reported overnight Wednesday , but not confirmed by the Pentagon . An organization that tracks the Syrian civil war said today that strikes were conducted in IS-controlled Syrian territory close to the border with Turkey , Reuters reports .
Mr. Obama ’ s UN speech comes as the president who sought to extricate the US from costly wars in Iraq and Afghanistan now seeks to rally world leaders to a military campaign against IS . The group has shocked the world by seizing territory in Iraq and Syria this summer and releasing videos of beheadings and other violent reprisals .
US airstrikes have also targeted another little-known organization within Syria , the Khorasan group , which US officials said Tuesday posed a greater immediate threat to the US and Europe than IS , the New York Times reports .
In his public appearances on Tuesday , Mr. Obama cautioned again that the campaign against the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or ISIL , would take time . He also cited the strike on Khorasan , the first time he has mentioned the group in public . “ Once again , it must be clear to anyone who would plot against America and try to do Americans harm that we will not tolerate safe havens for terrorists who threaten our people , ” he said at the White House before his departure for New York .

US President Barack Obama will press for a broad international coalition to fight Islamic State militants in a speech to the United Nations today, a day after the US launched airstrikes against the group in Syria.

On Tuesday, the US and five Arab nations dropped more than 160 missiles and bombs inside Syria in the first round of what Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby called “only the beginning” of US-led strikes.

Additional airstrikes were reported overnight Wednesday, but not confirmed by the Pentagon. An organization that tracks the Syrian civil war said today that strikes were conducted in IS-controlled Syrian territory close to the border with Turkey, Reuters reports.

Mr. Obama’s UN speech comes as the president who sought to extricate the US from costly wars in Iraq and Afghanistan now seeks to rally world leaders to a military campaign against IS. The group has shocked the world by seizing territory in Iraq and Syria this summer and releasing videos of beheadings and other violent reprisals.

US airstrikes have also targeted another little-known organization within Syria, the Khorasan group, which US officials said Tuesday posed a greater immediate threat to the US and Europe than IS, the New York Times reports.

In his public appearances on Tuesday, Mr. Obama cautioned again that the campaign against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, would take time. He also cited the strike on Khorasan, the first time he has mentioned the group in public. “Once again, it must be clear to anyone who would plot against America and try to do Americans harm that we will not tolerate safe havens for terrorists who threaten our people,” he said at the White House before his departure for New York. Most officials speaking publicly on Tuesday characterized the Khorasan threat as imminent. Lt. Gen. William C. Mayville Jr., who is in charge of operations for the Pentagon’s Joint Staff, said the terrorist group was nearing “the execution phase of an attack either in Europe or the homeland.”

Obama faces criticism from some Syrian regime supporters such as Iran and Russia, who say that strikes within Syria are illegal without the approval of President Bashar al-Assad, whose regime Obama opposes. Some European allies have also questioned the legality of unauthorized military action in Syria.

“ ISIS sells the women as slave girls , the way they are doing it , they are using the women as human shields to protect them from U.S. airstrikes , ” said Hameed , a Yazidi refugee who is seeking safe haven in Northern Iraq . He escaped his village when ISIS invaded and fled to Sinjar Mountain with his family where he stayed for 7 days with limited food and water . ISIS is still holding four of his family members hostage .
Hameed said that his family members that are still being held hostage spoke to him on the phone saying that “ ISIS are using the hostages as human shields to protect themselves from the U.S. airstrikes. ” He said that he has spoken with members of ISIS as well on the phone and they told him that they aren ’ t going to hurt his family members , but the reason they are keeping them hostage is to protect themselves from U.S. airstrikes .

People are running from their houses , they are trying to get whatever they can and are fleeing to the mountain , ” he said .
“ ISIS began searching for individuals who stayed in the village , regardless if they found anyone , elder or in a wheelchair , they would take them as slaves and sell them out in the market place or somewhere else . ”
Hameed said that after ISIS kidnapped the people , they would blow up headquarters and buildings that belong to Kurdistan parties . “ They burn alcohol stores . Whoever stayed there was being ripped out from his house , they took the people to the center and will probably execute them . ”
He said that even if people do nothing wrong and don ’ t pick up a weapon , they will still be killed , “ they will still kill you and treat you like an infidel. ” He added that he spoke with a neighbor from his village on that phone who is very wealthy who is helping by buying some of the women that ISIS is selling as slaves so he can return them to their families .
Hameed heard that ISIS was retreating from a village where some of the first clashes took place between the native citizens and ISIS , not because of fighting , but due to the smell from the dead bodies . “ The reason is because they can ’ t bear the environment because of the smell , even traffic is stopped in areas because we have this large amount of dead bodies. ” This echoes reports from Iraqi Member of Parliament Vian Dakhil , the legislature ’ s only Yazidi representative , who reported that Islamic State jihadists had been overwhelmed by the scent of their own killings .
“ We can ’ t go back home because we know what will happen to us if we go back home . We will be killed , ” he said .

isis,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/10/obama-military-offensive-against-islamic-state-wil/,"2 years after withdrawal, Obama makes case for new military action in Iraq",2014-09-10,Dave Boyer,"President Obama announced an escalation of the war against Islamic State terrorists Wednesday night with plans to intensify airstrikes in Iraq , send more U.S. military advisers to Baghdad , provide arms to Syrian rebels and likely expand airstrikes into Syria .
“ If left unchecked , these terrorists could pose a growing threat beyond that region — including to the United States , ” Mr. Obama said in a prime-time address from the White House . “ We will conduct a systematic campaign of airstrikes against these terrorists . ”
The president ordered another 475 military advisers to Iraq , on top of 300 advisers he sent there in June and 130 U.S. personnel he sent last month to aid in a humanitarian mission .
In addition to ramping up the bombing missions that will be flown by U.S. warplanes and drones against the Islamic State in Iraq , Mr. Obama said the air war likely will be expanded into Syria when U.S. reconnaissance missions identify more targets of the terrorist organization also known by the acronyms ISIL and ISIS .
Indeed , in an echo of President George W. Bush ’ s anti-terror doctrine , he specified that terrorists will not be safe in any country .
“ I have made it clear that we will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country , wherever they are , ” Mr. Obama said . “ That means I will not hesitate to take action against ISIL in Syria , as well as Iraq . This is a core principle of my presidency : If you threaten America , you will find no safe haven . ”
SEE ALSO : HAYDEN : Obama will need to put more boots on the ground
While the president outlined a multipronged military and diplomatic strategy for going on the offensive against the surging Sunni militants , he took pains to contrast the expanded campaign with Mr. Bush ’ s wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .
For example , he referred to this campaign , which has surpassed more than 150 airstrikes in Iraq , as a counterterrorism operation instead of a war — a word he used in only two references to what his plan is not .
“ I want the American people to understand how this effort will be different from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , ” Mr. Obama said . “ It will not involve American combat troops fighting on foreign soil . This counterterrorism campaign will be waged through a steady , relentless effort to take out ISIL wherever they exist using our air power and our support for partner forces on the ground . ”
The strategy , unveiled just two weeks after Mr. Obama said he had no plan for defeating the militants in Syria , will rely on the U.S. and its allies arming moderate Syrian rebels who are battling both the Islamic State and the regime of President Bashar Assad in a 3-year-old civil war .
While some in Congress have been urging Mr. Obama for years to arm the Syrian rebels , other lawmakers reacted warily to the plan .
“ We have to make sure that we ’ re not putting weapons into the hands of al Qaeda or other jihadis , ” Rep. Peter T. King , New York Republican , said on CNN .
In Iraq , the president said the formation of a new government under Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi will be the key to rehabilitating the dubious Iraqi army and taking the fight to the militants .
“ With a new Iraqi government in place , and following consultations with allies abroad and Congress at home , I can announce that America will lead a broad coalition to roll back this terrorist threat , ” Mr. Obama said . “ Our objective is clear : We will degrade , and ultimately destroy , [ the Islamic State ] through a comprehensive and sustained counterterrorism strategy . ”
On the eve of the 13th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , Mr. Obama ’ s announcement of the military escalation was a dramatic turnaround by a president who dismissed the Islamic State nine months ago as a “ JV ” terrorist group . Last year , the president told Americans that the large-scale war against Islamist extremism was all but over .
The gains by the terrorist group have brought Mr. Obama to a decision to carry out a military campaign in Syria only one year after he announced — and then withdrew — plans to launch missile attacks against the Assad regime for using chemical weapons in the civil war .
Although Mr. Obama didn ’ t announce a specific air campaign in Syria , aides said U.S. airstrikes against militants there are only a matter of time .
“ We are going to take airstrikes in Syria at a time and place of our choosing , ” said a senior administration official . “ We will take action on the Syrian side of the border … but we ’ re not going to telegraph our punches . ”
Mr. Obama has said he has the authority to proceed with much of his plan without formal approval from Congress . But he is seeking lawmakers ’ authorization for $ 500 million to train and equip Syrian rebels , a request he first made in May in a speech at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point .
House Republicans raised a potential roadblock for that operation Wednesday by not including the measure in temporary funding legislation . Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden were calling lawmakers and urging them to include the authorization in the funding bill .
The president also ordered $ 25 million under the Foreign Assistance Act to be spent on equipment and training for the Iraqi army , including Kurdish forces .
House Speaker John A. Boehner said after the speech that Mr. Obama made a welcome turn and “ recanted his earlier dismissals of ISIL ’ s capabilities and rightly acknowledged the grave and growing threat posed by the spreading global epidemic of radicalized Islam . ”
But the Ohio Republican said questions remain about the president ’ s plan because training Iraqi forces “ could take years to fully implement at a time when ISIL ’ s momentum and territorial gains need to be immediately halted and reversed . ”
“ It is also a cause for concern that the president appears to view the effort against ISIL as an isolated counterterrorism campaign , rather than as what it must be : an all-out effort to destroy an enemy that has declared a holy war against America . ”
Before the speech , Sen. Ted Cruz , Texas Republican , said Mr. Obama must seek congressional authorization for proposed military action against the Islamic State .
“ Only Congress has the authority to declare war . While our commander in chief has constitutional authority to respond to an imminent danger , Obama has not suggested that is the case , ” Mr. Cruz wrote in an op-ed for CNN . “ He is reportedly planning a mission that could last as long as three years and may require a range of actions . ”
Some Democrats , too , are expressing reservations about expanding the offensive . Rep. John Garamendi , California Democrat , said he wants to make sure the plan isn ’ t limited to airstrikes .
“ We can not win this with bombing , ” he said . “ This is going to have to be a diplomatic effort with the countries in the area coming together and deciding it is in their best interests to stifle and snuff out [ the Islamic State ] . ”
After Mr. Obama ’ s speech , several liberal advocacy groups reacted negatively to the president ’ s plan .
“ We remain deeply troubled by any plan for U.S. military engagement that has not been explicitly debated by the American people and voted on by Congress , ” said Neil Sroka , a spokesman for Democracy for America . “ After more than a decade of war , the American people and their representatives in Congress must have a calm , rational public debate of that response and the appropriate level of U.S. involvement . ”
The president and his top advisers also were working to firm up a coalition including Arab states to fight the militants . Mr. Obama spoke by phone with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia , ahead of a gathering of Arab leaders on their contributions to a global coalition against the Islamic State .
Secretary of State John F. Kerry is heading to Saudi Arabia and Jordan this week , after stopping in Baghdad on Wednesday to meet with Iraq ’ s new leaders and pledging U.S. support for eliminating the extremist group and the threat it poses .
Mr. Kerry said the Iraqis have achieved a historic result by forming a new government under Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi , a key to Mr. Obama ’ s plan to rebuild the Iraqi army to fight the militants more effectively .
“ This is a broad-based , comprehensive strategy that is being laid out , ” Mr. Kerry said . “ And it will not just be reserved to bombs or direct military assistance . It will be comprehensive with Iraqi forces on the ground in Iraq with an army that will be reconstituted and trained and worked on in terms of a number of different strategies . ”
France ’ s foreign minister said his country was ready to take part in airstrikes against extremist fighters in Iraq if needed . The German government announced that it was sending assault rifles , ammunition , antitank weapons and armored vehicles to Kurdish forces in Iraq , breaking with the NATO member ’ s decadeslong reluctance to send weapons into conflict areas .
Mr. Kerry also announced that the U.S. is providing nearly $ 48 million in additional humanitarian aid for Iraqis internally displaced and refugees who have fled to Jordan , Lebanon and Syria . It brings the total amount of U.S. humanitarian assistance to displaced Iraqis to more than $ 186 million in fiscal year 2014 .

“With a new Iraqi government in place, and following consultations with allies abroad and Congress at home, I can announce that America will lead a broad coalition to roll back this terrorist threat,” Mr. Obama said. “Our objective is clear: We will degrade, and ultimately destroy, [the Islamic State] through a comprehensive and sustained counterterrorism strategy.”

On the eve of the 13th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Mr. Obama’s announcement of the military escalation was a dramatic turnaround by a president who dismissed the Islamic State nine months ago as a “JV” terrorist group. Last year, the president told Americans that the large-scale war against Islamist extremism was all but over.

The gains by the terrorist group have brought Mr. Obama to a decision to carry out a military campaign in Syria only one year after he announced — and then withdrew — plans to launch missile attacks against the Assad regime for using chemical weapons in the civil war.

Although Mr. Obama didn’t announce a specific air campaign in Syria, aides said U.S. airstrikes against militants there are only a matter of time.

“We are going to take airstrikes in Syria at a time and place of our choosing,” said a senior administration official. “We will take action on the Syrian side of the border … but we’re not going to telegraph our punches.”

Mr. Obama has said he has the authority to proceed with much of his plan without formal approval from Congress. But he is seeking lawmakers’ authorization for $500 million to train and equip Syrian rebels, a request he first made in May in a speech at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.

House Republicans raised a potential roadblock for that operation Wednesday by not including the measure in temporary funding legislation. Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden were calling lawmakers and urging them to include the authorization in the funding bill.

The president also ordered $25 million under the Foreign Assistance Act to be spent on equipment and training for the Iraqi army, including Kurdish forces.

House Speaker John A. Boehner said after the speech that Mr. Obama made a welcome turn and “recanted his earlier dismissals of ISIL’s capabilities and rightly acknowledged the grave and growing threat posed by the spreading global epidemic of radicalized Islam.”

But the Ohio Republican said questions remain about the president’s plan because training Iraqi forces “could take years to fully implement at a time when ISIL’s momentum and territorial gains need to be immediately halted and reversed.”

“It is also a cause for concern that the president appears to view the effort against ISIL as an isolated counterterrorism campaign, rather than as what it must be: an all-out effort to destroy an enemy that has declared a holy war against America.”

Before the speech, Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican, said Mr. Obama must seek congressional authorization for proposed military action against the Islamic State.

“Only Congress has the authority to declare war. While our commander in chief has constitutional authority to respond to an imminent danger, Obama has not suggested that is the case,” Mr. Cruz wrote in an op-ed for CNN. “He is reportedly planning a mission that could last as long as three years and may require a range of actions.”

Some Democrats, too, are expressing reservations about expanding the offensive. Rep. John Garamendi, California Democrat, said he wants to make sure the plan isn’t limited to airstrikes.

“We cannot win this with bombing,” he said. “This is going to have to be a diplomatic effort with the countries in the area coming together and deciding it is in their best interests to stifle and snuff out [the Islamic State].”

After Mr. Obama’s speech, several liberal advocacy groups reacted negatively to the president’s plan.

“We remain deeply troubled by any plan for U.S. military engagement that has not been explicitly debated by the American people and voted on by Congress,” said Neil Sroka, a spokesman for Democracy for America. “After more than a decade of war, the American people and their representatives in Congress must have a calm, rational public debate of that response and the appropriate level of U.S. involvement.”

The president and his top advisers also were working to firm up a coalition including Arab states to fight the militants. Mr. Obama spoke by phone with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, ahead of a gathering of Arab leaders on their contributions to a global coalition against the Islamic State.

Secretary of State John F. Kerry is heading to Saudi Arabia and Jordan this week, after stopping in Baghdad on Wednesday to meet with Iraq’s new leaders and pledging U.S. support for eliminating the extremist group and the threat it poses.

Mr. Kerry said the Iraqis have achieved a historic result by forming a new government under Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi, a key to Mr. Obama’s plan to rebuild the Iraqi army to fight the militants more effectively.

“This is a broad-based, comprehensive strategy that is being laid out,” Mr. Kerry said. “And it will not just be reserved to bombs or direct military assistance. It will be comprehensive with Iraqi forces on the ground in Iraq with an army that will be reconstituted and trained and worked on in terms of a number of different strategies.”

France’s foreign minister said his country was ready to take part in airstrikes against extremist fighters in Iraq if needed. The German government announced that it was sending assault rifles, ammunition, antitank weapons and armored vehicles to Kurdish forces in Iraq, breaking with the NATO member’s decadeslong reluctance to send weapons into conflict areas.

Mr. Kerry also announced that the U.S. is providing nearly $48 million in additional humanitarian aid for Iraqis internally displaced and refugees who have fled to Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. It brings the total amount of U.S. humanitarian assistance to displaced Iraqis to more than $186 million in fiscal year 2014.

The U.S. air war in Iraq and Syria against the self-proclaimed Islamic State is now in its eighth month.

American officials say dropping bombs won't be enough to defeat that group; it will also require fighting on the ground. So the U.S. is trying to put together a ground force in Syria by training and equipping thousands of Syrians.

One big question is what the U.S. will do if these Syrian rebel forces get attacked by the regime of Bashar Assad — and so far, the U.S. doesn't have an answer.

When President Obama first talked about training a fighting force in Syria, the idea was to help them battle the Assad regime, not just ISIS.

""I will work with Congress,"" he said last May at West Point, ""to ramp up support for those in the Syrian opposition who offer the best alternative to terrorists and brutal dictators.""

But by September, when U.S. air strikes began in Syria, the target was ISIS, not Assad's forces. This created an unusual battlefield — American planes targeting a group in Syria's territory, but not Syria's government, raising questions about what would happen to the rebel fighters the U.S. was hoping to train.

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel assured Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain at the time that if those fighters were attacked by Assad's forces, they would be protected.

""We will help them and we will support them, as we have trained them,"" Hagel told McCain.

""How will we help them?"" McCain asked. ""Will we repel Bashar Assad's air assets that will be attacking them?""

""Any attack on those that we have trained who are supporting us, we will help them,"" Hagel answered.

This week, asked that same question on Capitol Hill, Ash Carter, the man who replaced Hagel as secretary of defense, had a very different answer.

""My understanding of that question is that we don't foresee that happening anytime soon,"" Carter said. ""But a legal determination, I'm told by the lawyers, has not been made.""

What the lawyers decide could depend on what new legal authority Congress gives Obama to fight ISIS. The president has sent Capitol Hill his draft for a new authorization for the use of military force, or AUMF.

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee examined that proposal at a hearing this week. Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican who chairs that panel, sought assurances that it would not leave the Syrian fighters the U.S. is standing up in the lurch.

isis,Vox,0,http://www.vox.com/2014/12/7/7333387/isis-baghdad-ollivant,How the ISIS war looks from Baghdad,2014-12-07,"Zack Beauchamp, Umair Irfan, Ella Nilsen, Sara Morrison, Rani Molla, Alex Abad-Santos, Jen Kirby","Sitting here in the US , it 's easy to be confused about what 's actually happening in the American-led war against ISIS . So it 's invaluable when experts like Doug Ollivant — former National Security Council Director for Iraq and current partner at Mantid International — visit the country .
Ollivant , who recently returned from a visit to Baghdad surveying the military and political situation , sat down with me to talk about what he saw . He thinks Americans are missing a lot of important developments : initial signs of ISIS weakness , a more promising Iraqi government , and an improving Iraqi army . What follows is a transcript of our conversation , edited for length and clarity .
Zack Beauchamp : You were just in Baghdad . How was it ?
Doug Ollivant : I would n't say it 's better than people think it is . I would say it 's more nuanced than the perception here is .
A couple things jump off the page at you . Life in Baghdad is normal : people are going to work , there are traffic jams , etc . Even though , in some places , the Islamic State is n't that far away , Baghdad 's just very normal .
Second , there are some very encouraging signs with the government . I was hearing about this before the Kurdistan deal [ a major oil-revenue sharing agreement with the central government ] signed . The mood is more accommodating ; much of this has to do with [ the replacement of former Prime Minister Nouri al- ] Maliki .
It reached a point where Maliki just had to go — not because of his personal views ; his sectarianism was much overwrought — but because he became a symbol of dysfunctional politics . There was so much personal hatred for him that it just froze the politics . No deals were gon na happen . This deal with Kurdistan — I think it 's been on the table for a year . The Kurds could have had this deal at pretty much any point , but it was n't going to happen under the last regime .
In that sense , the replacement of Maliki is good just as a reset button for relations .
Third , we 're starting to see some decent signs that the Iraqi security forces are starting to get their act together . They 're pushing out through Samarra and Diyala provinces ; no major victories in the sense that they 're not retaking huge cities yet . We 've heard some reports of Sunni leaders in Anbar reaching out to [ Shia ] militias , though they 're still isolated incidents .
ZB : It sounds like ISIS might more vulnerable — and the American strategy against it more effective — than people generally believe . Is that how it looks on the ground ?
DO : Yeah . The Islamic State 's Achilles Heel is that it 's an Islamic state . When it takes over territory , it acts like an Islamic state . Most people do n't like that very much . Once they get in , and they really start governing , it 's remarkably unpopular .
I do n't have many friends in the [ ISIS-controlled ] north , but I have friends who do . They get calls from people they know , from the old days , that people have worked for the government or for the Americans are being rounded up . And the Islamic State is rounding up their daughters — plaintive calls from Iraqi men saying `` please , they 've taken my 14 and 15-year-old daughters . '' What can they do ? The answer is nothing .
ZB : Did you see any signs of backlash from Iraq 's Sunnis while you were there ? I 've seen a few scattered reports of uprisings , but nothing cohesive .
DO : I think part of it is that the Islamic State has learned as well [ since 2006 ] . We actually saw this before their large invasion ; two to three years prior to that there was a very quiet campaign going on of killing senior Awakening/Iraqi tribal leaders . At the time , most people blamed Iranian militias for it . But in retrospect , maybe that was n't what was going on . This was laying the groundwork to make sure that the leadership structure was attrited .
I think that 's what 's going on now . Former Awakening leaders are being rounded up . The Islamic State knows what happened in 2006 and 2007 [ when a tribal uprising against al-Qaeda in Iraq , ISIS 's former incarnation , broke its hold on large parts of Iraq ] . They want to make sure that does n't happen again .
ZB : There 've been some reports that they 've conducted an extermination campaign against a Sunni tribe — the Abu Nimr — after a minor revolt .
DO : Yeah , the Abu Nimr , right in the center of Anbar Province . I 'm not real clear on the reason for their uprising — whether it was a reaction to one particular event , or whether it was just `` this is our land , not yours . '' But whatever it was , they stood up to the Islamic State . And it looks like the Islamic State destroyed their fighting force in detail . They were just overwhelmed .
So I think they recognize this weakness [ vulnerability to tribal uprisings ] . But there 's a snowball effect . The steps that they take to ensure that no one rises up against them are also very draconian . And in turn inspire even more resentment , and family and tribal debts , so to speak .
Now , I do n't think we really have a feedback loop yet . But we have some anecdotes . We know there 's anger , but I do n't think anyone up there [ in ISIS 's northern strongholds ] is in a position to do anything yet . I think there were groups that kind of let the Islamic State in , thinking they can control this . It appears they ca n't control this , which sets the stage for the return of the Iraqi state — if they can get the politics worked out .
ZB : So what has to be done to get the politics right ? You suggested the removal of Maliki was making a difference . Is new Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi a better leader ?
DO : Abadi 's kind of on his honeymoon . But he 's making hay while the sun shines , so to speak . Getting the Kurdish oil deal was a big deal .
ZB : What does it enable in terms of the ISIS fight ?
DO : It 's about money . This was a win-win deal : there 's more money in the system and there 's more oil to be exported .
Militarily , this allows Baghdad to fund the peshmerga [ Kurdish militias ] directly . This allows the peshmerga to be paid . And while it 's not explicitly stated , I think it allows for having a lot more weapons flow through Baghdad up through Kurdistan — which they 've wanted for a long time .
We 'll see . There could be a lot of devils in the details . But still , just getting the deal could be a positive sign .
ZB : How well is Abadi doing at including Sunnis in the government ? That 's obviously a huge part of signaling to Sunnis in ISIS-controlled territory that the national government is on their side .
DO : He appears to be doing OK. You have a Sunni defense minister and , given that it 'll be the army in the lead for the eventual retaking of Mosul and Fallujah , that 's a big deal . The bulk of those troops will be Shia , but everyone will know that the defense minister controlling them is a Sunni Arab .
There is one thing I saw there that made me pessimistic . There 's less of a sense , among the Shias and the Kurds , that the Sunni Arabs are people they can live with .
We 've read a lot about the Shia militias purging Sunnis out of some areas in the south ; we hear less about the Kurds pushing Sunnis out of areas in the north , though it 's also going on . It 's not ethnic cleansing : not super-violent , more bureaucratic , but it 's nonetheless happening .
Many Iraqis see the Sunni population as collaborators with ISIS . It 's going to require a lot of work for someone to knit this back together again .
ZB : And what about the military ? Is it getting any better ?
DO : The problem with Iraq is that it 's a cash economy . It 's really hard to figure out who 's getting paid what , so it 's difficult to put systems in place to guard against corruption and waste .
That said , we 've seen a response to the army being mistrained and mispositioned . They 've recently announced that , instead of trying to train 300,000 troops , they 're trying to train about nine shock brigades [ which will require an unclear , but significantly smaller number of troops than 300,000 ] . It 's an acknowledgement that it 's a different fight , requiring a different army and a different kind of training .
The kind of army that 's going to be needed to go retake Fallujah is an entirely different one from the kind that are going to be different from the people you want pacifying Mosul . There 's a great literature about how hard it was for the US Army to try to do both ; it 's not hard to believe that a much less capable army would need to train almost two different armies to accomplish both missions .
ZB : How does the US training play into this ? Is the US presence contributing ?
DO : The Americans have set up training sites where they 'll train these shock brigades , explicitly teaching them how to retake terrain .
Americans will live on these training sites . The intent is that they 'll never have to leave the walls , and will really be invisible to the local population . That 's very important : Americans being inside Iraq is really a huge political trigger inside Iraqi politics . And even something as simple as a military resupply column going from Baghdad to al-Assad Airbase might well be seen as a provocation . I think the American commander understands that .
ZB : The criticism that you hear a lot is that the US spent so much time and effort training the Iraqi military during the invasion , and it did n't take . Could a comparatively small deployment make such a difference ?
DO : I think it 's different . The Iraqis have a sense of urgency that they may not have had before . The holding of their terrain by a terrorist force is a grave personal affront to the Iraqi polity , so there 's a different level of motivation on the part of the Iraqis to do this .
Moreover , the Iraqis are a very young , immature , weak democracy . We know from the political science literature that these kinds of countries go through repeated crises . The US helped get them through the 2006-2008 crisis — and we should be proud of ourselves .
But that does n't mean there is n't going to be another crisis down the road . And that crisis might be related to the crisis that came before it — maybe even as a result of the responses taken to the last crisis . But that 's just the way it is . Iraq is a young , immature democracy and it 's going to have repeated crises . If we solve this one , there 's probably going to be another crisis four or five years down the road .
And here 's one thing that still makes me hopeful about Iraq . There are those who say that `` Iraq is n't a nation . '' That just is n't true . Are the borders kind of unclear ? Yeah . Is there a strong sectarian and tribal identity that moves across these borders ? Yes , that 's also true .
But that 's not incompatible with there being a sense of Iraqi identity . That identity is still there , and it 's still important . It is by no means a fait accompli that the Iraqi state survives , but it 's just untrue to say to say these people do n't see themselves as Iraqi .
People who go to Iraq tend to be more optimistic — it 's a place that looks worse than it is . You see the dysfunction up close , but it functions . Particularly when you look at the south — there 's this pretty stable , resilient base in the south that 's generating income , and that can be used as a base for the Iraqi state for the foreseeable future .","Sitting here in the US, it's easy to be confused about what's actually happening in the American-led war against ISIS.

We actually saw this before their large invasion; two to three years prior to that there was a very quiet campaign going on of killing senior Awakening/Iraqi tribal leaders. At the time, most people blamed Iranian militias for it. But in retrospect, maybe that wasn't what was going on. This was laying the groundwork to make sure that the leadership structure was attrited.

I think that's what's going on now. Former Awakening leaders are being rounded up. The Islamic State knows what happened in 2006 and 2007 [when a tribal uprising against al-Qaeda in Iraq, ISIS's former incarnation, broke its hold on large parts of Iraq]. They want to make sure that doesn't happen again.

ZB: There've been some reports that they've conducted an extermination campaign against a Sunni tribe — the Abu Nimr — after a minor revolt.

DO: Yeah, the Abu Nimr, right in the center of Anbar Province. I'm not real clear on the reason for their uprising — whether it was a reaction to one particular event, or whether it was just ""this is our land, not yours."" But whatever it was, they stood up to the Islamic State. And it looks like the Islamic State destroyed their fighting force in detail. They were just overwhelmed.

So I think they recognize this weakness [vulnerability to tribal uprisings]. But there's a snowball effect. The steps that they take to ensure that no one rises up against them are also very draconian. And in turn inspire even more resentment, and family and tribal debts, so to speak.

Now, I don't think we really have a feedback loop yet. But we have some anecdotes. We know there's anger, but I don't think anyone up there [in ISIS's northern strongholds] is in a position to do anything yet. I think there were groups that kind of let the Islamic State in, thinking they can control this. It appears they can't control this, which sets the stage for the return of the Iraqi state — if they can get the politics worked out.

ZB: So what has to be done to get the politics right? You suggested the removal of Maliki was making a difference. Is new Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi a better leader?

DO: Abadi's kind of on his honeymoon. But he's making hay while the sun shines, so to speak. Getting the Kurdish oil deal was a big deal.

ZB: What does it enable in terms of the ISIS fight?

DO: It's about money. This was a win-win deal: there's more money in the system and there's more oil to be exported.

Militarily, this allows Baghdad to fund the peshmerga [Kurdish militias] directly. This allows the peshmerga to be paid. And while it's not explicitly stated, I think it allows for having a lot more weapons flow through Baghdad up through Kurdistan — which they've wanted for a long time.

We'll see. There could be a lot of devils in the details. But still, just getting the deal could be a positive sign.

ZB: How well is Abadi doing at including Sunnis in the government? That's obviously a huge part of signaling to Sunnis in ISIS-controlled territory that the national government is on their side.

DO: He appears to be doing OK. You have a Sunni defense minister and, given that it'll be the army in the lead for the eventual retaking of Mosul and Fallujah, that's a big deal. The bulk of those troops will be Shia, but everyone will know that the defense minister controlling them is a Sunni Arab.

There is one thing I saw there that made me pessimistic. There's less of a sense, among the Shias and the Kurds, that the Sunni Arabs are people they can live with.

We've read a lot about the Shia militias purging Sunnis out of some areas in the south; we hear less about the Kurds pushing Sunnis out of areas in the north, though it's also going on. It's not ethnic cleansing: not super-violent, more bureaucratic, but it's nonetheless happening.

Many Iraqis see the Sunni population as collaborators with ISIS. It's going to require a lot of work for someone to knit this back together again.

ZB: And what about the military? Is it getting any better?

DO: The problem with Iraq is that it's a cash economy. It's really hard to figure out who's getting paid what, so it's difficult to put systems in place to guard against corruption and waste.

Americans will...be invisible to the local population

That said, we've seen a response to the army being mistrained and mispositioned. They've recently announced that, instead of trying to train 300,000 troops, they're trying to train about nine shock brigades [which will require an unclear, but significantly smaller number of troops than 300,000]. It's an acknowledgement that it's a different fight, requiring a different army and a different kind of training.

The kind of army that's going to be needed to go retake Fallujah is an entirely different one from the kind that are going to be different from the people you want pacifying Mosul. There's a great literature about how hard it was for the US Army to try to do both; it's not hard to believe that a much less capable army would need to train almost two different armies to accomplish both missions.

ZB: How does the US training play into this? Is the US presence contributing?

DO: The Americans have set up training sites where they'll train these shock brigades, explicitly teaching them how to retake terrain.

Americans will live on these training sites. The intent is that they'll never have to leave the walls, and will really be invisible to the local population. That's very important: Americans being inside Iraq is really a huge political trigger inside Iraqi politics. And even something as simple as a military resupply column going from Baghdad to al-Assad Airbase might well be seen as a provocation. I think the American commander understands that.

ZB: The criticism that you hear a lot is that the US spent so much time and effort training the Iraqi military during the invasion, and it didn't take. Could a comparatively small deployment make such a difference?

DO: I think it's different. The Iraqis have a sense of urgency that they may not have had before. The holding of their terrain by a terrorist force is a grave personal affront to the Iraqi polity, so there's a different level of motivation on the part of the Iraqis to do this.

Moreover, the Iraqis are a very young, immature, weak democracy. We know from the political science literature that these kinds of countries go through repeated crises. The US helped get them through the 2006-2008 crisis — and we should be proud of ourselves.

it's a place that looks worse than it is

But that doesn't mean there isn't going to be another crisis down the road. And that crisis might be related to the crisis that came before it — maybe even as a result of the responses taken to the last crisis. But that's just the way it is. Iraq is a young, immature democracy and it's going to have repeated crises. If we solve this one, there's probably going to be another crisis four or five years down the road.

Eventually, you want these crises to be less serious.

ZB: This one's pretty bad!

DO: So was the last one.

And here's one thing that still makes me hopeful about Iraq. There are those who say that ""Iraq isn't a nation."" That just isn't true. Are the borders kind of unclear? Yeah. Is there a strong sectarian and tribal identity that moves across these borders? Yes, that's also true.

But that's not incompatible with there being a sense of Iraqi identity. That identity is still there, and it's still important. It is by no means a fait accompli that the Iraqi state survives, but it's just untrue to say to say these people don't see themselves as Iraqi.

People who go to Iraq tend to be more optimistic — it's a place that looks worse than it is. You see the dysfunction up close, but it functions. Particularly when you look at the south — there's this pretty stable, resilient base in the south that's generating income, and that can be used as a base for the Iraqi state for the foreseeable future.",www.vox.com,left,5niyy50ZnykXfUDc

Instead , he began firing .
`` He made a bad choice , '' a senior military source told Fox News .
Abd al-Rahman Mustafa al-Qaduli , also known as Abu Ala al-Afri and Haji Imam , died in a hail of bullets early Thursday morning on an isolated road in eastern Syria , a location described by U.S. military officials as being `` in the middle of nowhere . ''
Defense Secretary Ash Carter told a press conference Friday he was ISIS ' finance minister . But the terror leader also was considered the man most likely to take over for ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi , if he were captured or killed .
Details of the takedown emerged Friday , including descriptions of the elite U.S. assault force arriving in helicopters as drones flew overhead , tracking him .
When al-Afri refused to surrender , he and all those with him were killed . If he had been captured , he would have been interrogated and then handed over to Iraqi authorities .
The U.S. team had been practicing the mission for weeks . `` It was a really good mission , '' one source familiar with the developments told Fox News . `` It was precision and went as planned . ''
`` We are systematically eliminating ISIL 's cabinet , '' Carter said at the news conference .
“ The removal of this ISIL leader will hamper the organization ’ s ability to conduct operations both inside and outside of Iraq and Syria . ''
Carter described the target as responsible for funding ISIS operations and involved in some external affairs and plots .
He said this was the second senior leader successfully targeted this month , in addition to the group ’ s “ minister of war ” Omar al-Shishani , or “ Omar the Chechen , ” killed in a recent U.S. airstrike .

Abd al-Rahman Mustafa al-Qaduli, also known as Abu Ala al-Afri and Haji Imam, died in a hail of bullets early Thursday morning on an isolated road in eastern Syria, a location described by U.S. military officials as being ""in the middle of nowhere.""

Defense Secretary Ash Carter told a press conference Friday he was ISIS' finance minister. But the terror leader also was considered the man most likely to take over for ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, if he were captured or killed.

Details of the takedown emerged Friday, including descriptions of the elite U.S. assault force arriving in helicopters as drones flew overhead, tracking him.

When al-Afri refused to surrender, he and all those with him were killed. If he had been captured, he would have been interrogated and then handed over to Iraqi authorities.

""We are systematically eliminating ISIL's cabinet,"" Carter said at the news conference.

“The removal of this ISIL leader will hamper the organization’s ability to conduct operations both inside and outside of Iraq and Syria.""

Carter described the target as responsible for funding ISIS operations and involved in some external affairs and plots.

He said this was the second senior leader successfully targeted this month, in addition to the group’s “minister of war” Omar al-Shishani, or “Omar the Chechen,” killed in a recent U.S. airstrike.

Adding to that uncertainty, the family of slain U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff said this week that the hostage was sold to the Islamic State by a supposedly moderate Syrian rebel group.

Middle East trip

Mr. Obama’s top counterterrorism adviser, Lisa Monaco, returned from the Middle East Tuesday and told colleagues that she was encouraged by the response from governments in the region to join the fight against the Islamic State. Among the nations most threatened by the militants is Jordan, where The Associated Press reported that the CIA has approached a retired former agency official with close ties to King Abdullah II about setting up a special task force to deal with the threat.

The Arab League has called on members to support international efforts against the Islamic State militarily and politically. Arab governments such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar thus far have avoided a prominent role for fear of provoking retaliatory attacks from the Sunni militants who control major regions of both Syria and Iraq.

The crosscurrents of the conflict are daunting, with the regimes in Syria and Iran, which are hostile to Washington, also determined foes of the Islamic State movement, and reliable allies for the United States on the ground hard to find.

News reports Tuesday indicated that the leader of an ultraconservative Islamic rebel group in Syria was killed Tuesday in a suicide bombing along with others of its top officials, its allies said, thereby weakening the ranks of the country’s already shaky armed opposition.

No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack that killed Hassan Aboud and other leading members of Ahrar al-Sham, part of the strongest front to challenge the Islamic State. But given that forces loyal to President Bashar Assad’s government do not typically use suicide bombers, it appeared likely that forces in the murky mix of opposition fighters in Syria’s 3-year-old civil war were involved, according to The Associated Press.

Mr. Obama, facing crucial midterm elections in which he needs his antiwar base, will also emphasize in his address Wednesday that he doesn’t envision a campaign in which the U.S. shoulders all of the costs and personnel for the fight, as in the last Iraq war.

“The president, as much as anyone else, has certainly learned the lessons that are evident from previous military activities in Iraq,” Mr. Earnest said. “It does not serve our interest to put the United States in the position in which we are bearing the load of the responsibility for providing security in the nation of Iraq.”

“Does he want to leave the White House as a peacetime president, declaring victory in the war against al Qaeda and returning the country to a sense of normalcy?” Mr. Ohlin asked. “Or does he want to leave the White House having recommitted the country to another costly military campaign? He cannot have it both ways — splitting the difference with a combination of airstrikes and promises to avoid mission creep.”

Obama vows to ‘destroy’ ISIS, make it ‘manageable’",2014-09-03,,"President Obama sent seemingly conflicting signals Wednesday about his ultimate goal in the fight against the Islamic State , saying at a press conference in Europe that the aim is to `` degrade and destroy '' the terror group -- but moments later , claiming he wants to make it a `` manageable problem . ''
The president spoke as lawmakers on Capitol Hill and others urge the White House and Pentagon to pursue a tough approach against the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or ISIL .
Those calls mounted after the group released another video showing the execution of an American journalist ; the White House on Wednesday confirmed that video as authentic .
Speaking in Estonia during a visit to Europe , Obama at first took a hard line . He condemned the execution as `` horrific '' and `` barbaric '' and vowed `` justice will be served . ''
After taking some heat for admitting last week that `` we do n't have a strategy yet '' to address the militant group in Syria , Obama said they do have a regional strategy . Ultimately , he said , `` our objective is clear , and that is to degrade and destroy ISIL so it is no longer a threat not just to Iraq but also the region and to the United States . ''
But later in the press conference , Obama returned to the topic and noticeably softened his tone .
He clarified that if the U.S. is joined by an international coalition , they can `` continue to shrink ISIL 's sphere of influence , its effectiveness , its financing , its military capabilities to the point where it is a manageable problem . ''
The remarks are likely to sow confusion on Capitol Hill , and possibly among allies .

The president spoke as lawmakers on Capitol Hill and others urge the White House and Pentagon to pursue a tough approach against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.

Those calls mounted after the group released another video showing the execution of an American journalist; the White House on Wednesday confirmed that video as authentic.

Speaking in Estonia during a visit to Europe, Obama at first took a hard line. He condemned the execution as ""horrific"" and ""barbaric"" and vowed ""justice will be served.""

After taking some heat for admitting last week that ""we don't have a strategy yet"" to address the militant group in Syria, Obama said they do have a regional strategy. Ultimately, he said, ""our objective is clear, and that is to degrade and destroy ISIL so it is no longer a threat not just to Iraq but also the region and to the United States.""

But later in the press conference, Obama returned to the topic and noticeably softened his tone.

He clarified that if the U.S. is joined by an international coalition, they can ""continue to shrink ISIL's sphere of influence, its effectiveness, its financing, its military capabilities to the point where it is a manageable problem.""

The remarks are likely to sow confusion on Capitol Hill, and possibly among allies.

""Are we going to contain ISIS or are we going to crush ISIS? And the president has not answered that,"" Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., told Fox News, reacting to the president's remarks.

Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., in a written statement, criticized the president's ""mixed messages"" on the Islamic State. ""The time to stop and destroy ISIL is now,"" he said.

Speaking Tuesday night on Fox News, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said the Islamic State has ""got to be destroyed"" and claimed the president does not yet have a strategy to implement that.

Speaking in Estonia today, President Obama issued a warning to the extremist group that took responsibility for beheading two American journalists: ""We will not be intimidated,"" Obama said, according to Time. ""Those who make the mistake of harming Americans will learn that we will not forget, and that our reach is long, and that justice will be served.""

As we reported, the Islamic State released a video Tuesday that showed a militant beheading American journalist Steven Sotloff. Overnight, the U.S. intelligence community came to the conclusion that the video was, indeed, authentic.

Sotloff is the second journalist to be killed by the militant group in Syria. The group released a similar video showing the beheading of James Foley in August.

In his comments today, Obama also sought to clarify his much talked about statement that the U.S. had not formulated a strategy for dealing with the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS or ISIL.

Obama said the U.S. strategy is not to eliminate the group, but to mitigate the risk it poses.

Time adds:

"" 'Our objective is to make sure that [ISIS] is not an ongoing threat to the region,' Obama said. 'And we can accomplish that.' ""The commander-in-chief added that it was unrealistic to expect that the entire organization can be dismantled. 'As we've seen with al Qaeda, there are always going to be remnants that can cause havoc,' he said.""

Of course, Obama is in Estonia in large part to deal with another crisis: the standoff between Ukraine and pro-Russian militants.

On that front, Obama said the U.S. had an ""unwavering commitment"" to NATO. His visit, the AP reports, is meant as a show of support for NATO allies ""anxious about Russia's aggression in Ukraine.""

USA TODAY

The Islamic State released a video Tuesday apparently depicting the beheading of another American journalist, the second such video in the terrorist group's relentless and grisly campaign to drive the United States out of the Mideast region.

Journalist Steven Sotloff, kneeling in an orange jumpsuit, says he is ""paying the price"" with his life for U.S. intervention in Iraq.

""You've spent billions of U.S. taxpayers' dollars and we've lost thousands of our troops in our previous fighting against the Islamic State,"" Sotfloff says. ""So where is the people's interest in reigniting this war?""

Moments later, a hooded man dressed in black blames President Obama before beheading Sotloff.

""I'm back, Obama, and I'm back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State,"" the man says. He then takes a knife to the throat of Sotloff.

SOTLOFF REMEMBERED:Had commitment to trouble zones

The video also includes a threat against British hostage David Haines. It warns governments to abandon the ""evil alliance of America against the Islamic State.""

The Islamic State, consisting of thousands of Sunni militants with roots in al-Qaeda, is carrying out a brutal campaign to carve a state from a swath of Syria and Iraq that would feature strict enforcement of sharia law. U.S. airstrikes have hindered the group's advance.

The SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors terrorist groups on social media and elsewhere, obtained the Islamic State video and posted it on its site. The video, entitled ""A Second Message to America,"" opens with a clip of a news conference in which Obama vows to pursue those who harm Americans.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said that, while the White House was not able to confirm the authenticity of the latest beheading video, ""Our thoughts and prayers, first and foremost, are with Mr. Sotloff and Mr. Sotloff's family and those who worked with him.

The State Department and National Security Council said intelligence officials were working to quickly determine if the video is authentic.

""If the video is genuine, we are sickened by this brutal act, taking the life of another innocent American citizen,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.

Britain and France called the killing ""barbaric."" British Prime Minister David Cameron said he would chair an emergency response meeting with his Cabinet early Wednesday.

In Washington, Republican lawmakers renewed calls for Obama to articulate a strategy for countering the terror group in light of the latest execution.

BRITISH HOSTAGE THREATENED:David Cawthorne Haines worked for aid groups

""What further proof do we need that this terrorist organization is intent on killing Americans? It is long overdue for the Obama Administration to present to the Congress, the American people, and our allies around the world a comprehensive strategy to respond to the horrific threat ISIS poses,"" said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Sotloff, 31, appeared in a video released by the Islamic State last month that showed the beheading of another journalist, James Foley. The group had threatened to kill Sotloff next.

His mother, Shirley Sotloff, then released a video appealing to the Islamic State for his release.

""Steven has no control over the actions of the U.S. government. He's an innocent journalist,"" she said. ""I've always learned that you, the caliph, can grant amnesty. I ask you to please release my child. As a mother, I ask your justice to be merciful and not punish my son for matters he has no control over.""

Sotloff family spokesman Barak Barfi said the family is aware of the video and is ""grieving privately.""

Sotloff was kidnapped Aug. 4, 2013, near Aleppo, after crossing the Syrian border from Turkey.

He had worked in the region as a freelance journalist and was published in Time,Foreign Policy and elsewhere. He was active on social media while he worked in the Middle East. One video shows him on the streets of Aleppo as a bomber flies overhead.

He was drawn to the hottest stories, regardless of the risks. He listed Benghazi, Libya, as his residence on social media and reported vigorously about the fatal U.S. Embassy attack in the city in late 2012, appearing on Fox News to offer his account and report on his interviews with guards at the compound.

Sotloff lived in the region for years and was fluent in Arabic. He was also a big fan of the NBA's Miami Heat, jazz and poetry.

One of his favorite quotes, which appeared on his Facebook page, was from late American diplomat George Kennan: ""We Americans like our adversaries wholly inhuman; all powerful, omniscient, monstrously efficient, unhampered by any serious problems of their own, and bent only on schemes for our destruction. Whatever their real nature, we always persist in seeing them this way.

Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , told the Times : `` The process should come from him . He ’ s the commander in chief . If he feels he needs this authority , he wants this authority , then he should be the leader . He should write down what he ’ s looking for in terms of authority and let us debate it. '' Sen . Robert Menendez , D-N.J. , told the Times : `` I have always felt that we should be continuing on an AUMF , but it ’ s a little difficult when the administration doesn ’ t produce any witnesses . So either they want an AUMF or they don ’ t . `` Bill O'Reilly , host of `` The O'Reilly Factor '' on Fox News Channel , noting the recent beheading of Peter Kassig , 26 , of Indiana , by ISIS , said : `` The bad guys are winning and the president seems hesitant to do what 's necessary to turn things around .

Some generals lead from the front, some from the rear and some, like President Obama, lawmakers are complaining, don't lead at all.Two weeks ago, President Obama promised a debate on how to conduct the war against the Islamic State (ISIS), but members of both sides of the aisle in Congress are frustrated that the president has yet to take action in formally requesting an authorization for use of military force (AUMF), The Washington Times reports Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told the Times: ""The process should come from him. He’s the commander in chief. If he feels he needs this authority, he wants this authority, then he should be the leader. He should write down what he’s looking for in terms of authority and let us debate it.""Sen.

The Islamic State reportedly released a new video Saturday claiming one of the two Japanese captives had been beheaded and issuing new demands for the other hostage's release.

In the video, Japanese freelance journalist Kenji Goto holds a photo that purportedly shows the dead body of the second hostage, Haruna Yukawa. SITE Intelligence Group, a U.S.-based organization that monitors extremist websites, said the video had been distributed across several Islamic State-linked Twitter accounts.

The Japanese government said it is seeking to verify the video.

isis,Fox Online News,2,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/08/28/obama-to-speak-ahead-national-security-meeting/,Hitting the Brakes? Obama downplays prospect of imminent strikes in Syria,2014-08-28,,"President Obama on Thursday downplayed the prospect of any imminent U.S. airstrikes in Syria , saying `` we do n't have a strategy yet '' and stressing that military advisers are still reviewing options for confronting Islamic State militants .
At the same time , the president bluntly ruled out U.S. military action for dealing with another international crisis -- mounting evidence of Russian incursions into eastern Ukraine . `` We are not taking military action to solve the Ukrainian problem , '' Obama said .
The president addressed both crises during remarks in the White House briefing room late Thursday afternoon , as Congress prepares to return from the summer recess . In recent days , lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have demanded that the U.S. strategy for targeting the Islamic State be put to a vote on Capitol Hill , amid speculation the military campaign might expand into Syria .
But Obama stressed Thursday that `` we do n't have a strategy yet '' and pushed back on reports that , he said , suggest the country is about to go `` full scale on an elaborate strategy '' in the Middle East .
`` The suggestion , I guess , has been that we 'll start moving forward imminently and somehow Congress , still out of town , is going to be left in the dark , '' he said . `` That 's not what 's going to happen . ''
White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest later clarified on CNN that the president referred specifically to Syria when he said there was no strategy yet .
Obama indicated that for the time being , the U.S. will continue to conduct airstrikes in northern Iraq and humanitarian missions , while working politically and diplomatically to `` cobble together '' a coalition for whatever the long-term strategy is .

''","President Obama on Thursday downplayed the prospect of any imminent U.S. airstrikes in Syria, saying ""we don't have a strategy yet"" and stressing that military advisers are still reviewing options for confronting Islamic State militants.

At the same time, the president bluntly ruled out U.S. military action for dealing with another international crisis -- mounting evidence of Russian incursions into eastern Ukraine. ""We are not taking military action to solve the Ukrainian problem,"" Obama said.

The president addressed both crises during remarks in the White House briefing room late Thursday afternoon, as Congress prepares to return from the summer recess. In recent days, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have demanded that the U.S. strategy for targeting the Islamic State be put to a vote on Capitol Hill, amid speculation the military campaign might expand into Syria.

But Obama stressed Thursday that ""we don't have a strategy yet"" and pushed back on reports that, he said, suggest the country is about to go ""full scale on an elaborate strategy"" in the Middle East.

""The suggestion, I guess, has been that we'll start moving forward imminently and somehow Congress, still out of town, is going to be left in the dark,"" he said. ""That's not what's going to happen.""

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest later clarified on CNN that the president referred specifically to Syria when he said there was no strategy yet.

Obama indicated that for the time being, the U.S. will continue to conduct airstrikes in northern Iraq and humanitarian missions, while working politically and diplomatically to ""cobble together"" a coalition for whatever the long-term strategy is.

To that end, he said he is sending Secretary of State John Kerry to the region to build a ""coalition"" to confront the threat.

The group has also demolished a number of monasteries and churches, as well as renowned pre-Islamic sites including Nimrud, Hatra and Nineveh in Iraq and Palmyra in Syria.

'Important place'

St Elijah's Monastery, or Deir Mar Elia, was believed to have been constructed by Assyrian monks in the late 6th Century. It was later claimed by a Chaldean Catholic order.

In 1743, its monks were given an ultimatum by Persian forces to convert to Islam. They refused and as many as 150 were massacred.

Had it not been for these satellite images, we would probably not have learnt about the monastery's destruction. This is because journalists and archaeologists cannot go to IS-controlled areas for security reasons. But more importantly, IS did not release any video on its propaganda outlets showing the demolition of this particular ancient site.

More than 100 churches and monasteries have been razed to the ground in Mosul and the predominantly Christian villages surrounding it, like Bashiqa and Qaraqosh, since they took control of the area in 2014.

The militants believe that Islam is the only religion that must be adopted by the followers of other faiths. And that is why they have targeted minorities and destroyed their places of worship. Those who have remained in these areas have been forced to choose between conversion and execution.

Secretary of State John Kerry said Wednesday coalition airstrikes have not flushed the terror group ISIS from Iraq , but they may have prevented the fall of Baghdad and Irbil to ISIS militants .
`` What we 've done is we 've stopped the onslaught . That was what we were able to achieve with air power . They were moving towards Irbil . They were moving towards Baghdad . Baghdad could well have fallen . Irbil could have fallen , '' Kerry said In an exclusive interview with CNN 's Christiane Amanpour .
The United States and coalition members conducted a second day of airstrikes Tuesday night in Syria and Iraq since the expanded military campaign against the extreme terror group began . But it will take time for airstrikes to degrade ISIS , Kerry said , echoing previous comments by President Barack Obama .
`` There 's a definitely a second day and there will be a third and more . This is going to go on , '' he added .
Kerry insisted , however , that airstrikes are n't designed to defeat ISIS by themselves . `` You and others should not be looking for some massive retreat in the next week or two , '' he told Amanpour .

The campaign will be lengthy , Kerry said , partly because the Iraqi military needs to be reconstituted , and because it will take time to arrange the kind of local support similar to the Sunni Awakening years ago .
The secretary of state said the battle to stop ISIS is a multifaceted effort that includes foreign fighters , cutting off financing , and a major effort to `` reclaim Islam by Muslims . ''
ISIS is a threat to the people in the region , he said , but also to national sovereignty .

Secretary of State John Kerry echoes the President, saying defeating ISIS will take time

Kerry could not confirm that a leader in the Khorasan Group was killed

Kerry and Obama are in New York for the United Nations General Assembly meeting

Secretary of State John Kerry said Wednesday coalition airstrikes have not flushed the terror group ISIS from Iraq, but they may have prevented the fall of Baghdad and Irbil to ISIS militants.

""What we've done is we've stopped the onslaught. That was what we were able to achieve with air power. They were moving towards Irbil. They were moving towards Baghdad. Baghdad could well have fallen. Irbil could have fallen,"" Kerry said In an exclusive interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour.

The United States and coalition members conducted a second day of airstrikes Tuesday night in Syria and Iraq since the expanded military campaign against the extreme terror group began. But it will take time for airstrikes to degrade ISIS, Kerry said, echoing previous comments by President Barack Obama.

""There's a definitely a second day and there will be a third and more. This is going to go on,"" he added.

Kerry insisted, however, that airstrikes aren't designed to defeat ISIS by themselves. ""You and others should not be looking for some massive retreat in the next week or two,"" he told Amanpour.

Comprehensive effort against ISIS

The campaign will be lengthy, Kerry said, partly because the Iraqi military needs to be reconstituted, and because it will take time to arrange the kind of local support similar to the Sunni Awakening years ago.

The secretary of state said the battle to stop ISIS is a multifaceted effort that includes foreign fighters, cutting off financing, and a major effort to ""reclaim Islam by Muslims.""

ISIS is a threat to the people in the region, he said, but also to national sovereignty.

Kerry and Obama are in New York for the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, where Obama will appeal to the global community to get behind the U.S.-led effort.

""I'm absolutely convinced that the coalition is on board,"" Kerry said, referring to five Arab nations that the United States considers partners in the military campaign.

Other targets

The first wave of airstrikes mostly targeted the Khorasan Group, which Obama described as ""seasoned al Qaeda operatives in Syria.""

Asked whether the leader of the Khorasan Group was killed in an airstrike, Kerry said he ""can't personally confirm that.""

He did confirm, however, that ""there were active plots"" against the United States, but he gave no details.

The U.S. Treasury Department does not have hard figures that it can make public on the group 's wealth but says it believes ISIS takes in millions of dollars a month .
Sources familiar with the subject say that ISIS ' `` burn ' rate '' -- how much the group spends -- is huge , including salaries , weapons and other expenses . For ISIS ' oil sales , sources told CNN , the group probably makes between $ 1 million and $ 2 million per day , but probably on the lower end .
Matthew Levitt , director of the Stein Program on Counterterrorism and Intelligence at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy in Washington , D.C. , calls ISIS `` the best-financed group we 've ever seen . ''
Levitt is a national expert on terrorism and its financing , working previously on intelligence and analysis at the U.S. Treasury and the FBI .
ISIS , Levitt says , is funded like no other traditional terrorist group in the past . Besides revenue from oil smuggling , the group receives money through donations from wealthy sympathizers in countries including Qatar and Kuwait .
But the group has another method of funding itself : through organized crime within the territories it has vanquished and now controls . The group , says Levitt , was born among crooks and thugs from a broken Iraq , and at its root it is a criminal enterprise .
`` We should n't be surprised , '' says Levitt . `` Remember , the Islamic State called ISIS is what used to be called the Islamic State of Iraq , and al Qaeda in Iraq , the Tawhid Network , the Zarqawi Network ; it 's all the same . And they were always primarily financed through domestic criminal activity within the borders of Iraq . ''
Levitt says ISIS operates as a massive organized crime group with virtually no law enforcement to rein it in -- and its long history has allowed it to set roots and develop over many years .
It means ISIS can demand money from people wherever it has established control . Want to do business in ISIS-controlled territory ? You pay a tax . Want to move a truck down an ISIS-controlled highway ? You pay a toll . Villagers in ISIS territory reportedly are charged and pay for just about everything .
`` There are reports that people in Mosul ( Iraq ) who want to take money out of their own bank accounts need to make a 'voluntary ' -- not so voluntary -- donation to the Islamic State , to ISIS , '' Levitt says . `` So controlling territory has given them opportunities that other groups like al Qaeda , who have n't controlled real territory , have n't had .

In the lawlessness that followed , he says , ISIS took over , robbed banks , began taxing and extorting the population , and now funds its war and expansion across Iraq and Syria almost independently .
Moustafa lobbies U.S. lawmakers for more support of moderate Syrian rebels who are now fighting both ISIS and the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad . He recently helped bring together several Congressional delegations to meet with moderate rebel groups on the border as part of that effort .
Coalition airstrikes , he says , are n't enough to destroy the kind of self-financing mob that ISIS has become . Instead , you need to take back the territory and restore civil order .

I can tell you that the policy that the White House has right now -- if it had this policy three years ago , there would have never been an ISIS , and we probably would have gotten rid of the Assad regime .

White House officials have said that Mr. Obama is operating under his constitutional powers as commander in chief in striking ISIS in Iraq , where the central government in Baghdad and Kurdish regional officials based in Erbil have requested United States assistance in battling the group . When the president announced what he described as a limited bombing campaign against ISIS , he said the goal was to protect Iraqi minorities besieged by ISIS and to safeguard American citizens and United States facilities in Iraq .
The president has been sending notifications to Congress on the airstrikes under the War Powers Act , which bars American troops from engaging in military action for more than 60 days without congressional authorization . But recent presidents have ignored that requirement . And some lawmakers in both parties are increasingly uncomfortable ceding the debate over military action in Iraq , and potentially Syria , to the president .
Senator Mitch McConnell , Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader , said Mr. Obama must explain to Congress how any additional authority he might seek to strike ISIS would protect Americans . He said training and equipping the militaries of partner nations to counter ISIS , as the president has done in Iraq and is proposing to do in Syria , “ is not tenable and will not generate sufficient combat power to protect America . ”
If the president is prepared to engage Congress “ with a strategic plan ” to protect the United States and its allies from ISIS , Mr. McConnell said in a statement on Saturday , “ I believe he will have significant congressional support. ” The ISIS threat , he added , “ is real and it ’ s growing . And it is time for President Obama to exercise some leadership in launching a response . ”
In the interview on Sunday , Mr. Obama said he envisioned the Free Syrian Army ’ s providing the ground presence needed to confront ISIS in Syria . He said that until a moderate Sunni opposition emerged , there was no real hope of ousting President Bashar al-Assad of Syria . But the opposition has been fractured , and the moderate militias are viewed as far less capable than ISIS .
“ Our attitude towards Assad continues to be that through his actions , through using chemical weapons on his own people , dropping barrel bombs that killed innocent children , that he has foregone legitimacy , ” Mr. Obama said . “ But when it comes to our policy and the coalition that we ’ re putting together , our focus specifically is on ISIL. ” ( ISIL is the name used by administration officials for the militant group . )","Such a request would trigger a congressional debate and vote, and could hinder another of Mr. Obama’s vows: to cut the Pentagon budget.

When the president announced what he described as a limited bombing campaign against ISIS, he said the goal was to protect Iraqi minorities besieged by ISIS and to safeguard American citizens and United States facilities in Iraq.

The president has been sending notifications to Congress on the airstrikes under the War Powers Act, which bars American troops from engaging in military action for more than 60 days without congressional authorization. But recent presidents have ignored that requirement. And some lawmakers in both parties are increasingly uncomfortable ceding the debate over military action in Iraq, and potentially Syria, to the president.

Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader, said Mr. Obama must explain to Congress how any additional authority he might seek to strike ISIS would protect Americans. He said training and equipping the militaries of partner nations to counter ISIS, as the president has done in Iraq and is proposing to do in Syria, “is not tenable and will not generate sufficient combat power to protect America.”

If the president is prepared to engage Congress “with a strategic plan” to protect the United States and its allies from ISIS, Mr. McConnell said in a statement on Saturday, “I believe he will have significant congressional support.” The ISIS threat, he added, “is real and it’s growing. And it is time for President Obama to exercise some leadership in launching a response.”

In the interview on Sunday, Mr. Obama said he envisioned the Free Syrian Army’s providing the ground presence needed to confront ISIS in Syria. He said that until a moderate Sunni opposition emerged, there was no real hope of ousting President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. But the opposition has been fractured, and the moderate militias are viewed as far less capable than ISIS.

“Our attitude towards Assad continues to be that through his actions, through using chemical weapons on his own people, dropping barrel bombs that killed innocent children, that he has foregone legitimacy,” Mr. Obama said. “But when it comes to our policy and the coalition that we’re putting together, our focus specifically is on ISIL.” (ISIL is the name used by administration officials for the militant group.)",www.nytimes.com,left,dWHIMGM9WxRsn8ae

Islamic State militants have acknowledged for the first time that they have been defeated in the Syrian town of Kobani, blaming withering airstrikes by a U.S.-led coalition for forcing them to flee the town on the Turkish border.

Although not a strategic site itself, Kobani — known by the militants as Ayn al-Islam — had turned into a test of wills between the militants and the coalition. At one point, Islamic State fighters controlled almost all of the town of 45,000 people and were on the verge of capturing it outright.

In a video released late Friday by the pro-Islamic State Aamaq News Agency, two fighters made it clear that the coalition's relentless air assault proved too much for the militants.

""A while ago, we retreated a bit from Ayn al-Islam because of the bombardment and the killing of some brothers,"" said one masked fighter who spoke Arabic with a North African accent.

In the video, he vowed to return to drive out the People's Protection Units known as the YPG, the main Kurdish militia in Syria, that the fighter referred to as ""rats.""

""The Islamic State will stay. Say that to (President) Obama,"" he said, pointing toward destruction on the edge of Kobani.

A second fighter, standing on a road with a green sign sprayed with the name Ayn al-Islam, described the incessant pounding by coalition aircraft.

""I swear by God, their planes did not leave the air, day and night; they did airstrikes all day and night,"" he said on the video. ""They bombarded everything, even motorcycles; they have not left a building standing. But, God willing, we will return and we will have our revenge multiplied.""

The Islamic State launched its offensive on the region surrounding Kobani in mid-September, capturing more than 300 Kurdish villages and parts of the city while driving out more than 200,000 Kurds.

The United States and several Arab allies began striking back and providing air cover for Kurdish militia to pour in from Turkey.

Why it matters : The interviews , given by members of the platoon members that served under Gallagher , break the SEALs ' unwritten code of silence and describe their leader as violent , `` evil '' and `` toxic '' — in contrast with Trump 's portrayal of him as a hero .
`` The guy is freaking evil , '' Special Operator First Class Craig Miller told investigators .
`` The guy was toxic , '' said Special Operator First Class Joshua Vriens , a sniper .
`` You could tell he was perfectly okay with killing anybody that was moving , '' added Special Operator First Class Corey Scott , a medic in the platoon .

Go deeper : Military officials say Trump 's SEAL interventions embolden war criminals","Navy SEAL platoon members painted a dark picture of Chief Petty Officer Eddie Gallagher, their leader who was acquitted of war crimes and had a minor charge cleared by President Trump, in leaked investigatory interview videos and text messages obtained by the New York Times.

Why it matters: The interviews, given by members of the platoon members that served under Gallagher, break the SEALs' unwritten code of silence and describe their leader as violent, ""evil"" and ""toxic"" — in contrast with Trump's portrayal of him as a hero.

What they're saying:

""The guy is freaking evil,"" Special Operator First Class Craig Miller told investigators.

""The guy was toxic,"" said Special Operator First Class Joshua Vriens, a sniper.

""You could tell he was perfectly okay with killing anybody that was moving,"" added Special Operator First Class Corey Scott, a medic in the platoon.

About 800 federal and state police officers raided more than a dozen properties across 12 Sydney suburbs as part of the operation -- the largest in Australian history , Australian Federal Police Deputy Commissioner Andrew Colvin told the Associated Press . A sword was removed as part of evidence at one of the homes .
Separate raids in the eastern cities of Brisbane and Logan were also conducted .
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported that the plan involved kidnapping randomly selected members of the public off the streets in Sydney and Brisbane , beheading them on camera , and releasing the recordings through Islamic State 's propaganda arm in the Middle East .
Later Thursday , Attorney General George Brandis confirmed that a person born in Afghanistan who had spent time in Australia and is now working with the Islamic State group in the Middle East ordered supporters in Australia to behead people and videotape the killings .
`` If the ... police had not acted today , there is a likelihood that this would have happened , '' Brandis told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation .
Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Brandis did not name the Australian . But Mohammad Ali Baryalei , who is believed to be Australia 's most senior member of the Islamic State group , was named as a co-conspirator in court documents filed Thursday . Police have issued an arrest warrant for Baryalei , a 33-year-old former Sydney nightclub bouncer .
A 22-year-old Sydney man , Omarjan Azari , appeared in court Thursday and is accused of conspiring with Baryalei and others to act in preparation for or plan a terrorist act or acts .
Prosecutor Michael Allnutt said he was involved in a `` plan to commit extremely serious offenses '' that was `` clearly designed to shock and horrify '' the public . It is not immediately clear what sentence Azari faces if convicted . The accused did not apply for bail and did not enter a plea . His next court appearance was set for November 13 .
Azari ’ s attorney , Steve Boland , said during the hearing that the allegation against his client was based `` on one phone call . '' He did not speak to reporters outside court .
Dozens of police spent Thursday searching Azari 's home and a car parked across the street from his house . One officer pulled a memo out of the car from the Australian National Imams Council outlining concerns about Australia 's new anti-terrorism proposals . The council did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment .
A second man was charged Thursday night in connection with the raids . The 24-year-old , who police did n't name , was charged with possessing ammunition without license and unauthorized possession of a prohibited weapon . He was released on bail and ordered to appear in court next week .
Nine of those detained were later released , New South Wales police said .
A crowd of around 300 people protested the raids at a rally in Sydney on Thursday night .
Uthman Badar , a spokesman for the Islamist group Hizt ut-Tahrir , warned of a growing unrest within Australia ’ s Muslim community .
“ We are tired of being made scapegoats . The government is the terrorist , ” he said in front of supporters wearing anti-government placards , according to News.com.au .
“ We would be fools to think we can now wake up and feel safer , ” he added . “ We are not fools to be deceived . There is anger in the community . We have been victimized for years and years . ”
Meanwhile , Abbott told reporters that he had been briefed on Wednesday night about the operation and discussed the planned beheadings .
`` That 's the intelligence we received , '' he told reporters . `` The exhortations -- quite direct exhortations -- were coming from an Australian who is apparently quite senior in ISIL to networks of support back in Australia to conduct demonstration killings here in this country . ''
The planned violence resembled the murder of Lee Rigby , a British soldier who was attacked and killed in May 2013 by two Nigerian-born Muslim converts near the Royal Artillery Barracks in southeast London .
`` This is not just suspicion , this is intent and that 's why the police and security agencies decided to act in the way they have , '' Abbott added .
The arrests come just days after the country raised its terror warning to the second-highest level in response to the domestic threat posed by supporters of ISIS .
`` Police believe that this group that we have executed this operation on today had the intention and had started to carry out planning to commit violent acts here in Australia , '' Colvin said . `` Those violent acts particularly related to random acts against members of the public . So what we saw today and the operation that continues was very much about police disrupting the potential for violence against the Australian community at the earliest possible opportunity . ''
New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said right now is a “ time for calm . ”
`` We need to let people know that they are safe , and certainly from our perspective , we know that the work this morning will ensure that all of those plans that may have been on foot have been thwarted . ''
Last week , Australian police arrested two men in Brisbane for allegedly preparing to fight in Syria , recruiting jihadists and raising money for the Al Qaeda offshoot group Jabhat al-Nusra , also known as the Nusra Front . Colvin said the raids conducted in Brisbane on Thursday were a follow-up to that operation . It was not yet clear how the investigations in Sydney and Brisbane were linked , he said .
However , Fairfax Media reported that the arrests of the men averted a terror attack by mere days .
The government raised its terrorism threat last week from `` medium '' to `` high '' on a four-tier scale on the advice of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization . The domestic spy agency 's Director-General David Irvine said the threat had been rising over the past year , mainly due to Australians joining ISIS to fight in Syria and Iraq .
When announcing the elevated threat level , Abbott stressed that there was no information suggesting a terror attack was imminent .
Police said at the time there was no terrorist threat to the Group of 20 leaders ' summit to be hosted by Brisbane in November which will bring President Barack Obama and other leaders of the world 's 20 biggest economies to the Queensland state capital .
Australia has estimated about 60 of its citizens are fighting for ISIS and the Nusra Front in Iraq and Syria . Another 15 Australian fighters had been killed , including two young suicide bombers .

The President says he supports partnerships , over the game of whack-a-mole
`` If we do our job right ... then over time our role can slow down , '' Obama says
House Speaker John Boehner questions the `` no boots on the ground '' strategy
A week after U.S.-led airstrikes in Syria began , lawmakers continued to question President Barack Obama 's strategy for defeating the militant group ISIS , which he admitted in a televised interview Sunday was more powerful than the U.S. initially believed .
Echoing sentiments also expressed by James Clapper , the head of U.S. intelligence services , Obama said the government `` underestimated what had been taking place in Syria '' during its civil war , allowing Syria to become `` ground zero for jihadists around the world . ''
Speaking in a taped interview with CBS ' `` 60 Minutes , '' Obama said the terrorists were remnants of al Qaeda in Iraq , which after being diminished by U.S. forces `` went back underground . ''
`` Over the past couple of years , during the chaos of the Syrian civil war , where essentially you have huge swaths of the country that are completely ungoverned , they were able to reconstitute themselves and take advantage of that chaos , '' Obama said , adding later the U.S. also overrated Iraq 's security forces , which were quickly overrun by ISIS when it took over the northern city of Mosul this summer .
The President stressed that the issue in Iraq is not simply a military problem ; it 's a political one .
`` This is America leading the international community to assist a country with whom we have a security partnership with , to make sure that they are able to take care of their business , '' he told `` 60 Minutes . ''
The President added : `` If we do our job right and the Iraqis fight , then over time our role can slow down and taper off . ''
Obama spent much of last week rallying international support for his mission against ISIS at the United Nations , telling leaders there the fighters represent a `` network of death '' that must be defeated .
An air campaign , which began last week and included coalition support from five Arab nations , continued over the weekend with strikes on the northern Syrian city of Ayn al-Arab , where Kurdish forces have been battling ISIS .
The mission is meant to `` degrade and ultimately destroy '' ISIS , Obama says . The White House has remained adamant there wo n't be any U.S. combat forces deployed in Iraq or Syria , though military `` advisers '' have been sent to Iraq in the hopes of fortifying local security forces .
The President warned the campaign probably wo n't conclude any time soon .
`` There is a cancer that has grown for too long that suggests that it is acceptable to kill innocent people who worship a different God .
`` And that kind of extremism , unfortunately , means that we 're going to see for some time the possibility that in a whole bunch of different countries , radical groups may spring up -- particularly in countries that are still relatively fragile , where you had sectarian tensions , where you do n't have a strong state security apparatus .
`` And that 's why what we have to do is , rather than play whack-a-mole and send U.S. troops wherever this occurs , we have to build strong partnerships , '' Obama told `` 60 Minutes . ''
Aides to Obama have been careful to underscore that the military operation in the Middle East wo n't resemble the wars of the past decade , which left many Americans skeptical of intervention abroad .
`` We 're doing this in a very different way than in the past , '' Tony Blinken , a deputy national security adviser , said on CNN 's `` State of the Union '' with Candy Crowley .
`` We 're not sending in hundreds of thousands of American troops , '' Blinken continued . `` We 're not spending trillions of American dollars . What we are doing is empowering local actors with some of the huge assets we can bring to this , like our airpower , intelligence , training and equipping , advising and assisting . ''
The `` no boots on the ground '' mantra was questioned Sunday by House Speaker John Boehner , who said if local forces are n't trained to battle ISIS quickly enough , U.S. troops would be required .
`` Maybe we can get enough of these forces trained and get 'em on the battlefield . But somebody 's boots have to be there , '' the Republican leader said on ABC 's `` This Week . ''
Boehner added later that if Obama advanced a new resolution authorizing the military action in Syria , he would be willing to call lawmakers back from the campaign trail to vote on it .
Obama claims he does n't need Congress ' permission for the air campaign under way in Iraq and Syria , citing the 2001 authorization to go after al Qaeda . He has said he would `` welcome '' Congress showing its support for the mission .
Sen. Chris Murphy , a Democrat from Connecticut , said Sunday an authorization vote would allow lawmakers -- and by turn the American public -- to hear more about long-term plans in Syria .
`` I think the reason that we need to have the debate is so that we can get a better explanation as to what the endgame is in Syria , '' Murphy , who sits on the Foreign Relations Committee , said on `` State of the Union . ''
`` In the end , that 's the check on a war without end : a Congress speaking for the American people who can put an end date on an authorization for military force or put a limitation , so that you ca n't use ground troops , '' he said .","Story highlights In a CBS interview, Barack Obama calls for a political solution in Iraq

Lured by man she met online , she became interested in ISIS
She joined female police brigade that enforces ISIS rules on women
The petite 25-year-old tentatively opens the door to the hotel room where we 've agreed to meet . Her face is covered , but her body language betrays her anxiety .
She slowly lifts her niqab , revealing her young , heart-shaped face . Her large brown eyes , filled with guilt and turmoil , are delicately made up under perfectly sculpted brows .
She calls herself 'Khadija . ' It 's not her real name , because she 's a marked woman . Once a member of a fearsome , female ISIS brigade , she 's a recent defector , disillusioned by the group 's brutality .
Her interview with CNN is the first time she has ever told anyone her story .
Growing up in Syria , Khadija 's family ensured she got an education . She earned her college degree and began teaching elementary school . Khadija describes her family and upbringing as `` not overly conservative . ''

When the Syrian uprising began more than three and a half years ago , Khadija joined the masses who began peaceful protests against the government of President Bashar al-Assad .
`` We 'd go out and demonstrate . The security services would chase us . We 'd write on walls , have different outfits to change into , '' she said . `` Those days were great . ''
But it was when the Syrian uprising spiraled into chaos and violence that she said she began to lose her soul , her humanity .
`` Everything around us was chaos , '' she said , her words tumbling out . `` Free Syrian Army , the regime , barrel bombs , strikes , the wounded , clinics , blood -- you want to tear yourself away , to find something to run to .
She found herself drawn to the eloquence of a Tunisian whom she met online . Taken with his manners , she grew to trust him over time and he gradually lured her into the Islamic State , she said . He assured her that the group was not what people thought , that it was not a terrorist organization .
`` He would say , 'We are going to properly implement Islam . Right now we are in a state of war , a phase where we need to control the country , so we have to be harsh . ' ''
He told her he was coming to the Syrian city of Raqqa , that they could even get married .
`` I got in touch with my cousin , and she said , 'You can come join us in the Khansa ' a Brigade . She was living in Raqqa with her husband who was with the Islamic State , '' Khadija said . The brigade is the feared , all-female police for ISIS .
Khadija convinced her family to move to Raqqa , saying it would be easier to register her younger siblings in school , and that they would have the support of relatives .
With her cousin to open the doors , Khadija was welcomed into the feared Khansa ' a brigade .
The Khansa ' a Brigade is made up of around 25 to 30 women and is tasked with patrolling the streets of Raqqa to ensure that women adhere to proper clothing as outlined by the Islamic State .

Beaded or slightly form-fitting abayas are banned . Women are not allowed to show their eyes .
The lashings to the women who broke ISIS rules were carried out by Umm Hamza .
`` She 's not a normal female . She 's huge , she has an AK , a pistol , a whip , a dagger and she wears the niqab , '' Khadija said .
Brigade commander Umm Rayan sensed Khadija 's fear `` and she got close to me and said a sentence I wo n't forget . She said , 'We are harsh with the infidels , but merciful among ourselves . ' ''
Khadija was trained to clean , dismantle , and fire a weapon . She was paid $ 200 a month and received food rations .
Her family sensed Khadija was slipping away , but were helpless to stop it . Her mother tried to warn her .
`` She would always say to me , 'Wake up , take care of yourself . You are walking , but you do n't know where you are going . ' ''
Initally , Khadija did not pay attention to her mother 's warnings , seduced by the sense of power . But eventually , she started questioning herself and the principles of the Islamic State .
`` At the start , I was happy with my job . I felt that I had authority in the streets . But then I started to get scared , scared of my situation . I even started to be afraid of myself . ''
She started thinking : `` I am not like this . I have a degree in education . I should n't be like this . What happened to me ? What happened in my mind that brought me here ? ''
Burned into her mind is an image she saw online of a 16-year-old boy who was crucified for rape . She questioned her inclusion in a group capable of such violence .
`` The worst thing I saw was a man getting his head hacked off in front of me , '' she said .
Even more personally , she witnessed ISIS ' brand of violence reserved for women . The brigade shared its building with a man who specialized in marriage for ISIS fighters .
`` He was one of the worst people , '' she said of the man tasked with finding wives for both local and foreign fighters .
`` The foreign fighters are very brutal with women , even the ones they marry , '' she said . `` There were cases where the wife had to be taken to the emergency ward because of the violence , the sexual violence . ''
With her commander pressuring her to submit to marriage , Khadija decided she needed to leave the brigade .
`` So it was at this point , I said enough . After all that I had already seen and all the times I stayed silent , telling myself , 'We 're at war , then it will all be rectified . '
`` But after this , I decided no , I have to leave . ''
Khadija left just days before the coalition airstrikes , but her family remains in Syria .
Khadija still wears the niqab , not just to conceal her identity but also because she 's struggling to adapt back to life outside the Islamic State .
Regretful of her immersion in radical Islam , she is wary of another sudden change .
`` It has to be gradual , so that I do n't become someone else . I am afraid of becoming someone else . Someone who swings , as a reaction in the other direction , after I was so entrenched in religion , that I reject religion completely , '' she said .
Towards the end of our interview , speaking about how ISIS could have gotten a foothold in parts of Syrian society , she has a personal moment .
`` How did we allow them to come in ? How did we allow them to rule us ? There is a weakness in us . ''

Lured by man she met online, she became interested in ISIS

She joined female police brigade that enforces ISIS rules on women

She witnessed beheading and violence against women

The petite 25-year-old tentatively opens the door to the hotel room where we've agreed to meet. Her face is covered, but her body language betrays her anxiety.

She slowly lifts her niqab, revealing her young, heart-shaped face. Her large brown eyes, filled with guilt and turmoil, are delicately made up under perfectly sculpted brows.

She calls herself 'Khadija.' It's not her real name, because she's a marked woman. Once a member of a fearsome, female ISIS brigade, she's a recent defector, disillusioned by the group's brutality.

Her interview with CNN is the first time she has ever told anyone her story.

'I ran away to something uglier'

Growing up in Syria, Khadija's family ensured she got an education. She earned her college degree and began teaching elementary school. Khadija describes her family and upbringing as ""not overly conservative.""

When the Syrian uprising began more than three and a half years ago, Khadija joined the masses who began peaceful protests against the government of President Bashar al-Assad.

""We'd go out and demonstrate. The security services would chase us. We'd write on walls, have different outfits to change into,"" she said. ""Those days were great.""

But it was when the Syrian uprising spiraled into chaos and violence that she said she began to lose her soul, her humanity.

""Everything around us was chaos,"" she said, her words tumbling out. ""Free Syrian Army, the regime, barrel bombs, strikes, the wounded, clinics, blood -- you want to tear yourself away, to find something to run to.

""My problem was I ran away to something uglier.""

Gradual induction

She found herself drawn to the eloquence of a Tunisian whom she met online. Taken with his manners, she grew to trust him over time and he gradually lured her into the Islamic State, she said. He assured her that the group was not what people thought, that it was not a terrorist organization.

""He would say, 'We are going to properly implement Islam. Right now we are in a state of war, a phase where we need to control the country, so we have to be harsh.'""

He told her he was coming to the Syrian city of Raqqa, that they could even get married.

""I got in touch with my cousin, and she said, 'You can come join us in the Khansa'a Brigade. She was living in Raqqa with her husband who was with the Islamic State,"" Khadija said. The brigade is the feared, all-female police for ISIS.

Khadija convinced her family to move to Raqqa, saying it would be easier to register her younger siblings in school, and that they would have the support of relatives.

With her cousin to open the doors, Khadija was welcomed into the feared Khansa'a brigade.

Inside the female ISIS brigade

The Khansa'a Brigade is made up of around 25 to 30 women and is tasked with patrolling the streets of Raqqa to ensure that women adhere to proper clothing as outlined by the Islamic State.

Beaded or slightly form-fitting abayas are banned. Women are not allowed to show their eyes.

Those who broke the laws are lashed.

The lashings to the women who broke ISIS rules were carried out by Umm Hamza.

When Khadija first saw Umm Hamza, she was terrified.

""She's not a normal female. She's huge, she has an AK, a pistol, a whip, a dagger and she wears the niqab,"" Khadija said.

Brigade commander Umm Rayan sensed Khadija's fear ""and she got close to me and said a sentence I won't forget. She said, 'We are harsh with the infidels, but merciful among ourselves.'""

Khadija was trained to clean, dismantle, and fire a weapon. She was paid $200 a month and received food rations.

Her family sensed Khadija was slipping away, but were helpless to stop it. Her mother tried to warn her.

""She would always say to me, 'Wake up, take care of yourself. You are walking, but you don't know where you are going.'""

Second thoughts

Initally, Khadija did not pay attention to her mother's warnings, seduced by the sense of power. But eventually, she started questioning herself and the principles of the Islamic State.

""At the start, I was happy with my job. I felt that I had authority in the streets. But then I started to get scared, scared of my situation. I even started to be afraid of myself.""

She started thinking: ""I am not like this. I have a degree in education. I shouldn't be like this. What happened to me? What happened in my mind that brought me here?""

And her image of ISIS began to crumble.

Burned into her mind is an image she saw online of a 16-year-old boy who was crucified for rape. She questioned her inclusion in a group capable of such violence.

""The worst thing I saw was a man getting his head hacked off in front of me,"" she said.

Violence against women

Even more personally, she witnessed ISIS' brand of violence reserved for women. The brigade shared its building with a man who specialized in marriage for ISIS fighters.

""He was one of the worst people,"" she said of the man tasked with finding wives for both local and foreign fighters.

""The foreign fighters are very brutal with women, even the ones they marry,"" she said. ""There were cases where the wife had to be taken to the emergency ward because of the violence, the sexual violence.""

Khadija saw a future she did not want.

With her commander pressuring her to submit to marriage, Khadija decided she needed to leave the brigade.

""So it was at this point, I said enough. After all that I had already seen and all the times I stayed silent, telling myself, 'We're at war, then it will all be rectified.'

""But after this, I decided no, I have to leave.""

Khadija left just days before the coalition airstrikes, but her family remains in Syria.

She was smuggled across the border to Turkey.

Life after ISIS

Khadija still wears the niqab, not just to conceal her identity but also because she's struggling to adapt back to life outside the Islamic State.

Regretful of her immersion in radical Islam, she is wary of another sudden change.

""It has to be gradual, so that I don't become someone else. I am afraid of becoming someone else. Someone who swings, as a reaction in the other direction, after I was so entrenched in religion, that I reject religion completely,"" she said.

Towards the end of our interview, speaking about how ISIS could have gotten a foothold in parts of Syrian society, she has a personal moment.

""How did we allow them to come in? How did we allow them to rule us? There is a weakness in us.""

Khadija spoke to us because she said she wants people, especially women, to know the truth about ISIS.

""I don't want anyone else to be duped by them. Too many girls think they are the right Islam,"" she said.

She desperately wants to be the girl she was before falling under the spell of ISIS -- ""a girl who is merry, who loves life and laughter... who loves to travel, to draw, to walk in the street with her headphones listening to music without caring what anyone thinks,"" she said.

""I want to be like that again.""",www.cnn.com,left,5VSiI7vIgNYdqDoL

France has seen its Muslim population explode to more than 8 million, and growing, according to the Gatestone Institute. It is the same in other European nations. While not all of these immigrants are terrorists, no doubt terrorists immigrated along with those looking for a better life, or were radicalized after arriving. Many Muslim immigrants have lived in isolation from Western cultures and values which their faith has taught them to hate.

According to the Pew Research Religion & Public Life Project, “the estimated share of legal Muslim immigrants entering the U.S. each year has roughly doubled, from about 5 percent of legal immigrants in 1992 to about 10 percent in 2012.”

While it is a diverse group with not all holding to the same ideology or hatred of the West, there are enough radicals among them to constitute a clear and present danger.

So, if even a small number of Muslim immigrants — or American citizens who have been radicalized by imams — attack a shopping mall, killing and terrorizing shoppers, what will the president do?

Will he treat it as a crime, “workplace violence,” or call it by its right name?

Will civil libertarians have their way in opposing further surveillance of potential and actual radicals, deporting some and stripping others of their U.S. citizenship, if they travel to align themselves with ISIS fighters and try to return to the U.S.?

Will they be allowed in? They should be barred.

These and many other questions must be answered before another attack, which our leaders repeatedly warn is coming.

Why is it coming? Because presidents over several administrations have not done all they could to prevent it, preferring soft words to tough action.

What will the current president do when the next attack comes? Will the public take matters into their own hands and fight back?

And it ’ s clear that airstrikes alone won ’ t beat back the extremist group . Which means that if the President wants to have any hope of meeting his far-reaching goal of destroying ISIS , he ’ s going to have to rely on private military contractors .
At the height of the Iraq war , these firms hired hundreds of thousands of people : guns-for-hire , IT geeks , logistics specialists , interrogators , and short order cooks to ladle out the slop at the military cafeteria . Over time , some of those contractors became the symbol for everything that was wrong with the Iraq war : hugely expensive , ineffective , and indifferent to Iraqi life . Contractors were at the middle of the war ’ s biggest scandals , from Abu Ghraib to Nissour Square . And it was the abductions and murder of Blackwater contractors that sparked one of Iraq 's biggest battles .
None of the five current and former contractors who spoke with The ███ expected a replay of last decade ’ s Iraq war . But they all said a major opportunity was coming—both for them , and for Obama , who could use the private armies as a way to conceal just how many people will be fighting in this new conflict .
“ Iraq this time around is not going to be as big as it was before , ” said Roger Carstens , a former special operations officer who has served as a contracted military adviser in Somalia and Afghanistan . “ That said , this new war will present an opportunity for the companies that have a resident train and advising capability to contribute to this new effort . ”
President Obama has asked Congress to authorize $ 500 million to train a new Syrian opposition out of Saudi Arabia . That money would be part of a $ 5 billion fund Obama requested this spring from Congress to help train and equip U.S. allies to fight terrorists .
One U.S. military contractor working in Iraq who asked not to be named said , “ I can tell you the contractor-expat community is abuzz thinking this will lead to more work . We expect a much larger footprint than he is showing right now . ”
Those expectations were whet earlier this summer , as ISIS was gaining ground in northern Iraq and the first U.S. special operations teams were arriving in Iraq , when the Pentagon asked military contractors to participate in two important surveys .
The first one , issued in July , asked the industry to give a rough estimate of the costs associated with building a new network of ten ground based communications satellite stations , known as VSATs in military lingo . VSATs were used by the U.S. military in the last decade throughout Iraq to provide forward operating bases with secure internet and voice communications .
The second one was more specific . It asked for estimates of the cost for “ Security Assistance Mentors and Advisers ” for Iraq ’ s ministry of defense and the Iraqi Counterterrorism Service .
A Pentagon spokeswoman told the ███ that the notice was not meant to be a request for proposal or the formal opening of the bidding process , but rather a chance to gauge the interest and capabilities of contractors down the road .
But contractors tell The ███ that these bureaucratic notices—plus a pledge from Obama to wage a long war against ISIS and train up Syrian and Iraqi fighters—represent a business opportunity for an industry that has shrunk in recent years .
In 2008 there were 242,558 contractors working in the countries for U.S. Central Command , the area that includes Iraq and Afghanistan as well as Somalia , Pakistan and Yemen , three countries where the United States has helped train local forces and conducted air strikes , according to the Pentagon ’ s official estimate .
That was during the height of the last round of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . By this July , that number had shrunk to 66,123 , according to the Pentagon ’ s latest estimate of military contractors working in the countries covered by Central Command , with only 14,634 contractors operating outside of Afghanistan .
But that ’ s only a fraction of America ’ s privatized security apparatus operating overseas . The State Department also offers billions of dollars to conduct security for diplomats and other officials . In 2011 , the State Department awarded Triple Canopy a four year deal worth up to $ 1.5 billion to provide security for the airport in Baghdad , U.S. diplomats and other Americans in the country . A State Department audit of the contract ( PDF ) found that at a minimum the State Department overpaid for those services by millions .
“ There has been consolidation after conflicts , ” said Doug Brooks , the president emeritus of the International Stability Operations Association , a trade association for professional military contractors . “ There is going to be business , you could say these are shoes instead of boots on the ground . But as in most cases these are going to be local faces who will be hired by these companies , who bring professionalism and training . They have been there already helping to build up the air force in Iraq . It won ’ t be like the past ten years , but there will be growth in services . ”
The shrinking market for military contractors led some of them to seek new patrons . In 2010 , for example , an African based military contractor named Saracen began training an anti-piracy force in Somalia with funding from the United Arab Emirates . When this reporter visited the base in 2012 , it was a privately-run outpost in Puntland with its own electricity generator , barracks , armory with former South African military officers giving basic training to locals .
But that experience led to some instability . After one of the South African trainers was murdered in 2012 by one of the recruits , the United Arab Emirates pulled out of the project .
One reason why the new war on ISIS won ’ t be like the old one against al Qaeda is because for now Obama has promised not to send ground forces to Iraq or Syria . The presence of U.S. forces overseas presents a number of opportunities for military contractors in providing everything from the dining facilities to the logistical transport for U.S. soldiers at war .
Also the budgets to fight al Qaeda and other groups expanded dramatically after 9/11 when many government institutions did not know exactly how to fight the new war . Blackwater—the private military firm founded by former NAVY SEAL Erik Prince—became a virtual extension of the CIA ’ s special activities division working to develop the deadly capability to target and kill al Qaeda operatives all over the world .
It was also Blackwater contractors working in Iraq to protect diplomatic convoys that shot what the Iraqi government said were 17 innocent protestors in the heart of Baghdad at Nisour Square . ( This summer , in the U.S. trial of the contractors , former employees of the company said they were responding to fire from the crowd . )
The legacy of Nisour square contributed to the decision of the Iraqi government in 2011 to decline to offer legal immunity to U.S. soldiers and military contractors . Carstens said that any new military contracts for Iraq that would involve training units of soldiers would have to include iron-clad guarantees that the contractors themselves would not be targeted by Iraqi courts . “ The companies will need to know that their contractors in Iraq and other places will have legal protections in case anything happens , ” he said .
Iraq recently promised immunity for U.S. troops—and it ’ s likely Baghdad will do the same for contractors too . After all , Iraq ’ s government has also formally requested U.S. assistance in fighting ISIS and that help was clearly going to include military contractors .
“ They are looking for the next big meal ticket and this could be it , ” said Sean McFate , a former military contractor for Dyncorp and the author of The Modern Mercenary : Private Armies and What They Mean for World Order . “ The things they will provide are logistical support , training or retraining security forces . ”
McFate said contractors gave Obama the opportunity to accomplish tasks normally associated with the U.S. military without sending boots on the ground . He said the training missions in particular “ would look like Iraqi military boots on the ground and not the U.S. military. ” But he said , “ It ’ s a political disguise . This is an industry that is a proxy , it is creating the environment of security and protection without too many U.S. soldiers on the ground . ”","America’s rapidly-expanding war against ISIS won’t involve large numbers of U.S. troops on the ground, President Obama is promising. And it’s clear that airstrikes alone won’t beat back the extremist group. Which means that if the President wants to have any hope of meeting his far-reaching goal of destroying ISIS, he’s going to have to rely on private military contractors.

At least, that’s what the contractors are hoping.

At the height of the Iraq war, these firms hired hundreds of thousands of people: guns-for-hire, IT geeks, logistics specialists, interrogators, and short order cooks to ladle out the slop at the military cafeteria. Over time, some of those contractors became the symbol for everything that was wrong with the Iraq war: hugely expensive, ineffective, and indifferent to Iraqi life. Contractors were at the middle of the war’s biggest scandals, from Abu Ghraib to Nissour Square. And it was the abductions and murder of Blackwater contractors that sparked one of Iraq's biggest battles.

None of the five current and former contractors who spoke with The Daily Beast expected a replay of last decade’s Iraq war. But they all said a major opportunity was coming—both for them, and for Obama, who could use the private armies as a way to conceal just how many people will be fighting in this new conflict.

“Iraq this time around is not going to be as big as it was before,” said Roger Carstens, a former special operations officer who has served as a contracted military adviser in Somalia and Afghanistan. “That said, this new war will present an opportunity for the companies that have a resident train and advising capability to contribute to this new effort.”

President Obama has asked Congress to authorize $500 million to train a new Syrian opposition out of Saudi Arabia. That money would be part of a $5 billion fund Obama requested this spring from Congress to help train and equip U.S. allies to fight terrorists.

One U.S. military contractor working in Iraq who asked not to be named said, “I can tell you the contractor-expat community is abuzz thinking this will lead to more work. We expect a much larger footprint than he is showing right now.”

Those expectations were whet earlier this summer, as ISIS was gaining ground in northern Iraq and the first U.S. special operations teams were arriving in Iraq, when the Pentagon asked military contractors to participate in two important surveys.

The first one, issued in July, asked the industry to give a rough estimate of the costs associated with building a new network of ten ground based communications satellite stations, known as VSATs in military lingo. VSATs were used by the U.S. military in the last decade throughout Iraq to provide forward operating bases with secure internet and voice communications.

The second one was more specific. It asked for estimates of the cost for “Security Assistance Mentors and Advisers” for Iraq’s ministry of defense and the Iraqi Counterterrorism Service.

A Pentagon spokeswoman told the Daily Beast that the notice was not meant to be a request for proposal or the formal opening of the bidding process, but rather a chance to gauge the interest and capabilities of contractors down the road.

But contractors tell The Daily Beast that these bureaucratic notices—plus a pledge from Obama to wage a long war against ISIS and train up Syrian and Iraqi fighters—represent a business opportunity for an industry that has shrunk in recent years.

In 2008 there were 242,558 contractors working in the countries for U.S. Central Command, the area that includes Iraq and Afghanistan as well as Somalia, Pakistan and Yemen, three countries where the United States has helped train local forces and conducted air strikes, according to the Pentagon’s official estimate.

That was during the height of the last round of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. By this July, that number had shrunk to 66,123, according to the Pentagon’s latest estimate of military contractors working in the countries covered by Central Command, with only 14,634 contractors operating outside of Afghanistan.

But that’s only a fraction of America’s privatized security apparatus operating overseas. The State Department also offers billions of dollars to conduct security for diplomats and other officials. In 2011, the State Department awarded Triple Canopy a four year deal worth up to $1.5 billion to provide security for the airport in Baghdad, U.S. diplomats and other Americans in the country. A State Department audit of the contract (PDF) found that at a minimum the State Department overpaid for those services by millions.

“There has been consolidation after conflicts,” said Doug Brooks, the president emeritus of the International Stability Operations Association, a trade association for professional military contractors. “There is going to be business, you could say these are shoes instead of boots on the ground. But as in most cases these are going to be local faces who will be hired by these companies, who bring professionalism and training. They have been there already helping to build up the air force in Iraq. It won’t be like the past ten years, but there will be growth in services.”

The shrinking market for military contractors led some of them to seek new patrons. In 2010, for example, an African based military contractor named Saracen began training an anti-piracy force in Somalia with funding from the United Arab Emirates. When this reporter visited the base in 2012, it was a privately-run outpost in Puntland with its own electricity generator, barracks, armory with former South African military officers giving basic training to locals.

But that experience led to some instability. After one of the South African trainers was murdered in 2012 by one of the recruits, the United Arab Emirates pulled out of the project.

One reason why the new war on ISIS won’t be like the old one against al Qaeda is because for now Obama has promised not to send ground forces to Iraq or Syria. The presence of U.S. forces overseas presents a number of opportunities for military contractors in providing everything from the dining facilities to the logistical transport for U.S. soldiers at war.

Also the budgets to fight al Qaeda and other groups expanded dramatically after 9/11 when many government institutions did not know exactly how to fight the new war. Blackwater—the private military firm founded by former NAVY SEAL Erik Prince—became a virtual extension of the CIA’s special activities division working to develop the deadly capability to target and kill al Qaeda operatives all over the world.

It was also Blackwater contractors working in Iraq to protect diplomatic convoys that shot what the Iraqi government said were 17 innocent protestors in the heart of Baghdad at Nisour Square. (This summer, in the U.S. trial of the contractors, former employees of the company said they were responding to fire from the crowd.)

The legacy of Nisour square contributed to the decision of the Iraqi government in 2011 to decline to offer legal immunity to U.S. soldiers and military contractors. Carstens said that any new military contracts for Iraq that would involve training units of soldiers would have to include iron-clad guarantees that the contractors themselves would not be targeted by Iraqi courts. “The companies will need to know that their contractors in Iraq and other places will have legal protections in case anything happens,” he said.

Iraq recently promised immunity for U.S. troops—and it’s likely Baghdad will do the same for contractors too. After all, Iraq’s government has also formally requested U.S. assistance in fighting ISIS and that help was clearly going to include military contractors.

“They are looking for the next big meal ticket and this could be it,” said Sean McFate, a former military contractor for Dyncorp and the author of The Modern Mercenary: Private Armies and What They Mean for World Order. “The things they will provide are logistical support, training or retraining security forces.”

By midday, Kurdish officials said they controlled about 22 miles of Highway 47, stretching both east and west of Sinjar, effectively cutting off one of the main supply routes for the Islamic State between Syria and the vital jihadist-held city of Mosul in Iraq.",www.nytimes.com,left,AnlejOvhjtojjTj0

Senior Defense and intelligence officials say the vast majority of detainees released from Guantanamo don't return to the fight -- and of those who do, relatively few have made it to Syria.

Of the 620 detainees released from Guantanamo Bay, 180 have returned or are suspected to have returned to the battlefield.

Of those 180, sources say 20 to 30 have either joined ISIS or other militants groups in Syria, or are participating with these groups from outside countries. Officials say most of those 20 to 30 are operating inside Syria.

Top military officials on Thursday acknowledged such recidivism but insisted most do not return to the battlefield.

The development underscores just one of many long-running complications for efforts to shutter Guantanamo Bay, a promise President Obama made within hours of taking the oath of office in 2009.

Nearly six years later, that effort has run aground, complicated by problems with relocating prisoners, by concerns about fighters returning to the battlefield and by Congress' resistance to allowing any to be detained on the U.S. mainland.

KMSP-TV in Minneapolis reported that Muhumed was killed in the same battle as Douglas McAuthur McCain , who grew up outside Minneapolis in the town of New Hope and most recently lived in San Diego . The State Department confirmed McCain 's death earlier this week , but spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Wednesday that the U.S. has no independent confirmation of the second American 's death . `` We 're looking into it , '' she said .
A source told Fox News that Muhumed 's family had been sent a photo of his body from Syria , but had not been formally notified by the State Department . Fox News was unable to contact the family .
A profile of Muhumed by Minnesota Public Radio this past June described him as a 29-year-old Somali-American who had been married more than once and was a father of nine children . MPR reported , citing the FBI , that at least 15 young men from the Twin Citites ' Somali-American community had traveled to Syria to join Islamic State , the militant group formerly known as ISIS that has captured wide swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq .
In a Facebook messages to an MPR reporter , Muhumed wrote `` I give up this worldly life for Allah '' and `` Allah loves those who fight for his cause . '' A picture posted on the social network showed Muhumed carrying a Koran in one hand and a rifle in the other .
Federal investigators believe that approximately 100 Americans have traveled to Syria to join Islamist groups . Most of them are disaffected young men targeted by recruitment videos like those one put out by the Somali-based , Al Qaeda-linked group al-Shabaab that praised Minnesota 's `` martyrs . '' One such `` martyr '' was Troy Kastigar , a high school classmate of Douglas McCain and a Muslim convert who was killed in Somalia in 2009 .
Abdi Bihi , a leader in the Twin Cities ' Somalian community , told KMSP that ISIS has recently begun trying to recruit young women from the Twin Cities to their cause .
`` They are brainwashing them to marry them off to jihadists , '' he said . `` They call them to help out as nurses , help out the wounded -- but the real catch is they will be sexually exploited . ''
While the jihadists may see fighting as a path to paradise , Bihi said the only thing young people who take that path will face is disappointment , possibly even death .
`` What will not change is the pain and agony and suffering of the parents , '' he lamented .","A second American reportedly killed fighting with the Islamic State group in Syria has been identified as Abdirahmaan Muhumed, of Minneapolis, two sources told Fox News late Wednesday.

In a Facebook messages to an MPR reporter, Muhumed wrote ""I give up this worldly life for Allah"" and ""Allah loves those who fight for his cause."" A picture posted on the social network showed Muhumed carrying a Koran in one hand and a rifle in the other.

Federal investigators believe that approximately 100 Americans have traveled to Syria to join Islamist groups. Most of them are disaffected young men targeted by recruitment videos like those one put out by the Somali-based, Al Qaeda-linked group al-Shabaab that praised Minnesota's ""martyrs."" One such ""martyr"" was Troy Kastigar, a high school classmate of Douglas McCain and a Muslim convert who was killed in Somalia in 2009.

Abdi Bihi, a leader in the Twin Cities' Somalian community, told KMSP that ISIS has recently begun trying to recruit young women from the Twin Cities to their cause.

""They are brainwashing them to marry them off to jihadists,"" he said. ""They call them to help out as nurses, help out the wounded -- but the real catch is they will be sexually exploited.""

While the jihadists may see fighting as a path to paradise, Bihi said the only thing young people who take that path will face is disappointment, possibly even death.

""What will not change is the pain and agony and suffering of the parents,"" he lamented.

Gen. Martin Dempsey , speaking to reporters on board a military plane traveling to Afghanistan , said Sunday that he believes the Sunni insurgent group formerly known as ISIS is not currently plotting or planning attacks against the U.S. or Europe .
ISIS has repeatedly made threats to attack the U.S. through social and conventional media . Earlier this month , in a Vice News documentary , a spokesman for the group vowed to `` raise the flag of Allah in the White House . '' The group took over Iraq 's second largest city , Mosul , in June , and has since declared an Islamic state , or caliphate , in a swath of territory covering northeastern Syria and northern and western Iraq . U.S. airstrikes and a new policy of direct military aid to Kurdish Peshmerga fighters have served as a check on a threatened ISIS advance toward Kurdish territory in northern Iraq .
On Sunday , Dempsey contrasted ISIS with the Yemen-based Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , which has plotted and attempted attacks against the U.S. and Europe . As a result , the U.S. has conducted counterterrorism strikes against the group within Yemen .
Dempsey said that so far , there is no sign that the Islamic State militants are engaged in `` active plotting against the homeland , so it 's different than that which we see in Yemen . ''
`` I can tell you with great clarity and certainty that if that threat existed inside of Syria that it would certainly be my strong recommendation that we would deal with it , '' said Dempsey . `` I have every confidence that the president of the United States would deal with it . ''
A senior U.S. Defense official spokesman later clarified to Fox News that the judgment on whether the Islamic State is a threat is just one trigger . `` Any threats against U.S. personnel and interests could drive action against ISIL in Syria , '' the official said .
Dempsey also told reporters that he believes that key allies in the region -- including Jordan , Turkey and Saudi Arabia -- will join the U.S. in quashing the Islamic State group .
`` I think ISIS has been so brutal , and has wrapped itself in a radical religious legitimacy that clearly threatens everybody I just mentioned , that I think they will be willing partners , '' said Dempsey , who added that those regional partners could come together and squeeze the Islamic State group `` from multiple directions in order to initially disrupt and eventually defeat them . It has to happen with them , much less with us . ''
Up to now , when asked about airstrikes inside Syria , Dempsey and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel have said all options remain on the table . But so far there has been no broader authorization for such operations .
Both officials spoke in dire terms last week about the threat posed by the Islamic State , with Dempsey saying the organization could not be defeated without some action in Syria .
But the senior U.S. Defense official spokesman said Monday that the message was the U.S. and its allies need a `` long-term strategy '' to separate ISIS from the population .
`` In the meantime , if we see a plot against the homeland , of course we 'll attack it , '' the official said .
The Obama administration has authorized airstrikes within Iraq to protect U.S. personnel and facilities and to help Iraqi and Kurdish forces assist refugees driven from their homes by the Islamic State . Most of the recent strikes have been around the Mosul Dam , which Islamic militants had taken , but it is now back in the hands of the Iraqi and Kurdish troops .
Senior U.S. leaders , from the White House to the Pentagon , have said the key to success in Iraq is the formation of an inclusive government that will include disenfranchised Sunnis .
As the Islamic State militants moved across Iraq , some Sunnis -- including some members of the Iraqi security forces -- either threw down their weapons or joined the group .
The U.S. has been encouraged as new Iraqi leaders , including Shiite prime minister-designate Haider al-Abadi , begin to take steps to form a new government and reach out to Sunnis .
Officials have suggested that any additional military assistance from the U.S. to Iraq is contingent on those political and diplomatic steps by the government .
One possibility , said Dempsey , would be to have U.S. forces provide more expanded advice and assistance to the Iraqi force .
He said military assessment teams looked at about 50 Iraqi brigades and a number of the Kurdish units and have a good idea which ones have appropriate training and equipment and have not been infiltrated by militia .
So far , Dempsey said the U.S. has not sought or received permission to put advisers into Iraqi brigades or headquarters units and accompany them into combat .
To date , U.S. forces have conducted a total of 96 airstrikes across Iraq . Of those , 62 have been around the Mosul Dam .
The strikes have helped to break the insurgents ' momentum , said Dempsey , and strip away some of the mythology that the Islamic State is impregnable or overwhelming .
Dempsey is on his way to Afghanistan to attend a change of command ceremony Tuesday . Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford is stepping down as the top commander there ; Army Gen. John Campbell will take over .","Despite threats to the contrary, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff insisted the Islamic State terror group is a regional threat and said he would not recommend U.S. airstrikes in Syria until he determines that they have become a direct threat to the U.S.

Both officials spoke in dire terms last week about the threat posed by the Islamic State, with Dempsey saying the organization could not be defeated without some action in Syria.

But the senior U.S. Defense official spokesman said Monday that the message was the U.S. and its allies need a ""long-term strategy"" to separate ISIS from the population.

""In the meantime, if we see a plot against the homeland, of course we'll attack it,"" the official said.

The Obama administration has authorized airstrikes within Iraq to protect U.S. personnel and facilities and to help Iraqi and Kurdish forces assist refugees driven from their homes by the Islamic State. Most of the recent strikes have been around the Mosul Dam, which Islamic militants had taken, but it is now back in the hands of the Iraqi and Kurdish troops.

Senior U.S. leaders, from the White House to the Pentagon, have said the key to success in Iraq is the formation of an inclusive government that will include disenfranchised Sunnis.

As the Islamic State militants moved across Iraq, some Sunnis -- including some members of the Iraqi security forces -- either threw down their weapons or joined the group.

The U.S. has been encouraged as new Iraqi leaders, including Shiite prime minister-designate Haider al-Abadi, begin to take steps to form a new government and reach out to Sunnis.

Officials have suggested that any additional military assistance from the U.S. to Iraq is contingent on those political and diplomatic steps by the government.

One possibility, said Dempsey, would be to have U.S. forces provide more expanded advice and assistance to the Iraqi force.

He said military assessment teams looked at about 50 Iraqi brigades and a number of the Kurdish units and have a good idea which ones have appropriate training and equipment and have not been infiltrated by militia.

So far, Dempsey said the U.S. has not sought or received permission to put advisers into Iraqi brigades or headquarters units and accompany them into combat.

To date, U.S. forces have conducted a total of 96 airstrikes across Iraq. Of those, 62 have been around the Mosul Dam.

The strikes have helped to break the insurgents' momentum, said Dempsey, and strip away some of the mythology that the Islamic State is impregnable or overwhelming.

Dempsey is on his way to Afghanistan to attend a change of command ceremony Tuesday. Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford is stepping down as the top commander there; Army Gen. John Campbell will take over.

Overall , there were no flat predictions to Congress that Iraq will be able to muster ground units capable of the gritty , persistent fighting needed to evict Islamic State terrorists , town by town , from Fallujah in the west to Mosul in the north .
Meanwhile , the voices of military analysts — including two former Obama defense chiefs — have grown louder in criticizing the administration ’ s latest strategy to combat the Islamic State .
Former Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta told “ CBS Evening News ” that the terrorist group rose to power because the U.S. pulled out of Iraq too quickly and waited too long to intervene in Syria .
“ I really thought that it was important for us to maintain a presence in Iraq , ” Mr. Panetta said in an interview set to air on “ 60 Minutes . ”
Mr. Panetta said the entire national security team urged Mr. Obama to give more support to rebels fighting in Syria against President Bashar Assad .
Mr. Panetta ’ s predecessor , former Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates , said Mr. Obama ’ s plan to rely on airstrikes without U.S. ground troops is doomed to failure .
“ The reality is , they ’ re not gon na be able to be successful against ISIS strictly from the air , or strictly depending on the Iraqi forces , or the [ Kurdish ] peshmerga or the Sunni tribes acting on their own , ” Mr. Gates said Wednesday on “ This Morning ” on CBS . “ So there will be boots on the ground if there ’ s to be any hope of success in the strategy . And I think that by continuing to repeat that [ the U.S. won ’ t put boots on the ground ] , the president , in effect , traps himself . ”
Retired Army Maj. Gen. Robert Scales echoed Mr. Gates ’ assessment , saying the Obama war Cabinet ’ s “ lack of confidence is well-founded . ”
“ What I find so interesting is a virtually complete consensus among active , retired military and virtually every policymaker in this town that this effort will fail . This is an unprecedented lack of confidence in our military effort , ” Gen. Scales said .
He added : “ Kerry deflects criticism about the military prospects by emphasizing the other elements of power , such as the financial , diplomatic and political . Problem is that this enemy is virtually unique about not giving a damn about anything but fighting and killing . ”
An officer at the Pentagon said , “ The DOD is not clear what they can or can ’ t do because the White House has not yet made it clear . Therefore , DOD is confused and struggling to make a decent plan . ”
At a Senate Committee on Foreign Relations hearing , Mr. Kerry was pressed by Sen. Marco Rubio , Florida Republican , on possible outcomes . The secretary of state said the ultimate ending is unclear and that Iran may be the possible savior in defeating the Islamic State .
“ I ’ m not going to get into hypotheticals , but you ’ re presuming that Iran and Syria don ’ t have any capacity to take on ISIL , ” Mr. Kerry said . “ I mean , who knows ? I ’ m not going to get — I don ’ t know what ’ s going to happen here . ”
He then raised the possibility of utter failure — and success .
“ If we ’ re failing and failing miserably , who knows what choice they [ Syria and Iran ] might make ? You prepositioned this on the notion we ’ re failing . I don ’ t believe we ’ re going to fail , ” he said . “ There are lots of possibilities . There are lots of possibilities between here and there . ”
At a Senate Committee on Armed Services hearing , Gen. Dempsey was asked if Sunni tribal leaders are coming to the coalition side — a key development in making the strategy work .
“ I can ’ t make that report yet , senator , ” said the four-star general , who played a major role in training the Iraqi Security Forces before U.S. troops pulled out in December 2011 .
Gen. Dempsey laid out an iffy scenario for success on the battlefield .
“ We know which [ Iraqi units ] are capable of partnering and improving their capabilities , ” he said . “ If we can get enough of them to go on the offensive , both west and north , get the peshmerga to squeeze from the north to south , and then find a way over time in Syria , initially to disrupt using air power and eventually to pressure using a moderate opposition , then I think [ this will ] place ISIL in an untenable position . ”
Iraqi forces retreated en masse rather than stand and fight as the Islamic State ’ s army crossed into northern Iraq from Syria in June and swallowed up territory from Mosul in the north to Tikrit in the south .
Asked if Iraq ’ s troops will not fight , Gen. Dempsey said , “ Yes , they will fight if they are well-led and believe that their government is looking out for not only their best interests but their families . ”
Army Col. Steve Warren , director of Pentagon press operations , said in an interview there are a “ number of ifs . ”
“ The strategy really does pivot on this coalition , ” he said . “ Everybody agrees you need troops on the ground . And everybody is relying on those troops to be Iraqi troops . So that is the big ‘ if. ’ Are [ the Iraq forces ] up to the task ? We don ’ t frankly know the answer yet . ”
Since the Iraqi troops ’ mass retreat , Col. Warren said , “ The Iraqis have comported themselves better . I mean , they did manage to retake the Mosul Dam . They did good work around Haditha . They did good work around Amerli . There are some good , solid Iraqi forces . But yeah , at the end of the day , there are a number of ‘ ifs. ’ There just are . But that ’ s all we ’ ve got . ”
Aided by U.S. airstrikes , Kurdish and Shiite militia fighters broke the Islamic State ’ s long siege of Amerli and its 15,000 residents earlier this month .
Gen. Scales , a highly decorated combatant in Vietnam , said Mr. Obama ’ s no-boots-on-the-ground edict “ violates virtually every tenet of modern American warfare . ”

Formed out of al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) in 2013, IS first captured Raqqa in eastern Syria

By early 2014 it controlled Falluja in western Iraq

Has since captured broad swathes of Iraq, seizing the northern city of Mosul in June

Fighting has displaced at least 1.2 million Iraqis

Pursuing an extreme form of Sunni Islam, IS has persecuted non-Muslims such as Yazidis and Christians, as well as Shia Muslims, whom it regards as heretics

In July alone, IS expanded dramatically, recruiting some 6,300 new fighters largely in Raqqa, an activist monitoring group said.

Back in September , Obama created a political problem for himself by saying “ we don ’ t have a strategy yet ” to combat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant , or ISIL .
On Monday , speaking at the end of a G-7 summit in Germany that included a meeting with new Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi , he rearranged the words and added an adjective , but said the same thing about training Iraqi troops to fight ISIL : “ We don ’ t yet have a complete strategy , ” Obama said .
The nuances of military planning don ’ t make for good sound bites .
To critics , this kind of statement is Obama admitting exactly what they accuse him of : that he ’ s a president neither prepared for what he ’ s facing in the Middle East nor willing to do what now needs to be done .
“ What has President Obama been doing for the last 10 months ? ” read a statement put out by the Republican National Committee immediately after Monday ’ s news conference .
Former Texas Gov . Rick Perry ’ s campaign put out a statement saying still not having a strategy is a “ failure of leadership . ”
“ If I were commander in chief , it would not take nine months to work with our military leaders to develop a complete strategy to destroy ISIS and protect American security interests and values , ” Perry said .
“ 10 months in and Pres . Obama ’ s anti-ISIS action has failed . We should unleash our air power to destroy ISIS , ” tweeted Texas Sen. Ted Cruz .
Jeb Bush said on Twitter : “ In Germany , Obama admitted again what has been clear for a while , he has no ISIS strategy . A serious effort to defeat them is needed . ”
And South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham weighed in calling it “ commander-in-chief malpractice . ”

This hasn ’ t been an easy case for the administration to make .

That ’ s compounded , Obama said , by an international community that might want to step in , but not before the Iraqis get their own situation together .
“ One of the things that we ’ re seeing in Iraq is that we ’ ve got more training capacity than we have recruits , ” Obama said .
“ A big part of the answer there is outreach to Sunni tribes , ” Obama added , which “ has not been happening as fast as it needs to . ”
Voicing concerns like this has not gone over well with the Iraqis in the past . Defense Secretary Ash Carter created a momentary commotion when he said in an interview last month that Iraqi forces showed “ no will to fight. ” That prompted a rushed call from Vice President Joe Biden to the Iraqi prime minister , to recognize “ the enormous sacrifice and bravery of Iraqi forces over the past 18 months in Ramadi and elsewhere , ” the White House said in its official read-out of the call .
Public relations on ISIL haven ’ t been going well for the administration . Last month , the White House put out celebratory news of a raid on an ISIL compound that had killed a major figure in the organization ’ s finances and captured his wife for what was all but acknowledged as a future of harsh interrogations .

Al-Abadi “ inheriting a legacy of a lot of mistrust between groups in Iraq , ” Obama said , and may not be able to get his own government together to pass a national guard law , or much else .

“ Without that kind of participation , ” Obama said , “ even if you have a short-term success , it ’ s hard to hold . ”","President Barack Obama still doesn’t have a strategy to combat the Islamic State.

Back in September, Obama created a political problem for himself by saying “we don’t have a strategy yet” to combat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, or ISIL.

On Monday, speaking at the end of a G-7 summit in Germany that included a meeting with new Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, he rearranged the words and added an adjective, but said the same thing about training Iraqi troops to fight ISIL: “We don’t yet have a complete strategy,” Obama said.

The nuances of military planning don’t make for good sound bites.

To critics, this kind of statement is Obama admitting exactly what they accuse him of: that he’s a president neither prepared for what he’s facing in the Middle East nor willing to do what now needs to be done.

“What has President Obama been doing for the last 10 months?” read a statement put out by the Republican National Committee immediately after Monday’s news conference.

The comments immediately lit up 2016 Republican presidential candidates.

Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s campaign put out a statement saying still not having a strategy is a “failure of leadership.”

“If I were commander in chief, it would not take nine months to work with our military leaders to develop a complete strategy to destroy ISIS and protect American security interests and values,” Perry said.

“10 months in and Pres. Obama’s anti-ISIS action has failed. We should unleash our air power to destroy ISIS,” tweeted Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.

Jeb Bush said on Twitter: “In Germany, Obama admitted again what has been clear for a while, he has no ISIS strategy. A serious effort to defeat them is needed.”

And South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham weighed in calling it “commander-in-chief malpractice.”

“It’s long past time we upped our game to confront this dangerous and growing threat to the American homeland,” Graham said in a statement.

Obama’s approach, they say, is more evidence of a commander in chief who’s consistently slow on the uptake — Obama called ISIL the “JV team” of terrorists just months before they overran the Iraq-Syrian border, seizing major territory and resources and executing American hostages.

The reason that there isn’t a complete strategy so far, Obama said, is that “it requires commitments on the part of the Iraqis as well about how recruitment takes place, how that training takes place. The details of that are not yet worked out.”

Obama added that the Pentagon is busy drawing up plans in consultation with the Iraqis, and once he’s brought a plan that he can sign off on, he’ll make the details public.

The gaffe comes at a moment when the White House is trying to push back on a stream of bad news coming out of Iraq, insisting that despite setbacks, the overall story on combating ISIL is one of progress.

This hasn’t been an easy case for the administration to make. A major part of the problem, Obama was trying to explain, is that ISIL forces are “nimble and they’re aggressive and they’re opportunistic,” compared with Iraqi troops, who aren’t showing up in the numbers they need to and aren’t ready for the fight when they do.

That’s compounded, Obama said, by an international community that might want to step in, but not before the Iraqis get their own situation together.

“One of the things that we’re seeing in Iraq is that we’ve got more training capacity than we have recruits,” Obama said.

“A big part of the answer there is outreach to Sunni tribes,” Obama added, which “has not been happening as fast as it needs to.”

Last month, the White House put out celebratory news of a raid on an ISIL compound that had killed a major figure in the organization’s finances and captured his wife for what was all but acknowledged as a future of harsh interrogations. The next day, ISIL showed it was still a force to be reckoned with by seizing Ramadi.

“We want to get more Iraqi security forces trained, fresh, well equipped and focused, and [Prime Minister] Abadi wants the same thing,” Obama said, trying to minimize any disagreements between the two governments.

It’s just, Obama said, that what al-Abadi wants may not matter all that much.

Al-Abadi “inheriting a legacy of a lot of mistrust between groups in Iraq,” Obama said, and may not be able to get his own government together to pass a national guard law, or much else.

Ed and Paula Kassig said in a statement Sunday that they had been told by a former hostage that their son Peter had voluntarily converted to Islam sometime between October and December of last year when he shared a cell with a Syrian Muslim . They said that their son `` took Islam 's practices seriously , including praying the five daily prayers and taking on the name Abdul-Rahman . ''
The Kassigs also released a letter written by their 26-year-old son in which he thanked them for their strength and commitment and appeared to try to prepare them for his death .
`` I am obviously pretty scared to die but the hardest part is not knowing , wondering , hoping , and wondering if I should even hope at all , '' Kassig said in the letter , according to his parents . `` I am very sad that all this has happened and for what all of you back home are going through . If I do die , I figure that at least you and I can seek refuge and comfort in knowing that I went out as a result of trying to alleviate suffering and helping those in need . ''
Kassig was taken captive by the Islamic State group Oct. 1 , 2013 , in Syria , where he was providing aid for refugees fleeing that country 's civil war .
The group said in a video after the beheading of British aid worker Alan Henning last week that Kassig would be next . The Kassigs pleaded for their son 's freedom in a video statement released Saturday .
The letter continues : `` In terms of my faith , I pray every day and I am not angry about my situation in that sense . I am in a dogmatically complicated situation here , but I am at peace with my belief . ''
The Kassigs say the complication appears to arise from his conversion but that they see this `` as part our son 's long spiritual journey . ''
According to the family , Kassig formed the aid organization Special Emergency Response and Assistance , or SERA , in Turkey to provide aid and assistance to Syrian refugees . He began delivering food and medical supplies to Syrian refugee camps in 2012 and is also a trained medical assistant who provided trauma care to injured Syrian civilians and helped train 150 civilians in providing medical aid .

“ The next phase is us going on the offensive , ” Obama said in an interview that aired Sunday on NBC ’ s “ Meet the Press . ”
The president said that on Wednesday he will not announce the use of U.S. ground troops or a campaign equal to the war in Iraq , and that his goal is to make clear the mission is to deal with terror threats like those over the past several years . A senior Obama administration official told Fox News imminent , new military action in either Iraq or Syria was not expected to be announced in the speech .
Obama said he has the “ authority he needs ” to increase attacks on Islamic State targets without congressional approval , but he did not answer repeated questions about whether he will order air strikes on Islamic State targets in Syria .
A senior White House official told Fox News that Obama 's primary aim in the Wednesday speech will be to update the American public on what the strategy is to deal with the militant group , saying the administration wants `` people to understand how he 's approaching this . ''
When Congress was on summer break , the president ordered strikes on the group ’ s military targets in Iraq , saying they were to protect U.S. personnel and requested by the Iraq government as part of a humanitarian effort to preserve infrastructure and save Iraqi minorities .
Obama said Sunday the upcoming effort is part of three-step plan that started with intelligence gathering and will include helping install a new Iraqi government .
Obama acknowledged on `` Meet the Press '' that the Islamic State is unique because of its “ territorial ambitions ” in the Middle East .
`` Over the course of months , we are going to be able to not just blunt the momentum of ISIL , '' he said , using an alternate name for the group . `` We are going to systematically degrade their capabilities . We 're going to shrink the territory that they control . And ultimately we 're going to defeat them . ''

The interview was conducted Saturday at the White House shortly after Obama returned from a NATO summit in Wales , where the Islamic State threat was a key topic of discussion . The speech will come one day before the 13th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks .
Obama restated his opposition to sending U.S. ground troops to engage in direct combat with the militants , who have laid claim to large swaths of territory in Iraq , targeted religious and ethnic minority groups , and threatened U.S. personnel and interests in the region .
At Obama 's direction , the U.S. military has conducted more than 130 air strikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq in the past month . In retaliation , the group recently beheaded two American journalists it had been holding hostage in Syria , where the organization also operates .
Lawmakers have pressed Obama to expand the air strikes into Syria . He has resisted so far , but said he has asked his military advisers for options for pursuing the group there .
In the interview , Obama said the U.S. would not go after the Islamic State group alone , but would operate as part of an international coalition and continue air strikes to support ground efforts that would be carried out by Iraqi and Kurdish troops .
At the NATO summit , the U.S. and nine allies agreed to take on the militants because of the threat they pose to member countries .
Obama 's emerging strategy depends on cooperation and contributions from regional partners , including Saudi Arabia , Jordan and Turkey , in addition to the formation of a new government in Iraq .

USA TODAY

The Islamic State militant group released a video Sunday that shows American aid worker Peter Kassig was beheaded, along with a dozen Syrian soldiers, in the latest killings the group has posted on the Internet.

The White House later said a review of the video confirms Kassig's death.

President Obama, in a statement issued as he flew back to Washington from Australia, said the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS, ""revels in the slaughter of innocents, including Muslims, and is bent only on sowing death and destruction.""

Obama said Kassig ""was a humanitarian who worked to save the lives of Syrians injured and dispossessed"" by war. He called Kassig's death ""an act of pure evil by a terrorist group that the world rightly associates with inhumanity.""

The president offered condolences to Kassig's family. ""We cannot begin to imagine their anguish at this painful time,"" he said.

Earlier during his flight, Obama was briefed about the video by national security adviser Susan Rice,White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.

Kassig, 26, a former U.S. Army Ranger from Indianapolis, worked for charity groups in Lebanon and Syria and was captured in Syria by militants in October last year.

During his captivity, his family said Kassig converted to Islam and changed his name to Abdul-Rahman, which means ""servant of the most merciful.""

The video released Sunday is over 15 minutes long and appears to show a dozen Syrian soldiers being beheaded. A militant clad in black with a concealed face is pictured next to a severed head that he says belongs to Kassig. His actual beheading was not shown.

""Here we are, eagerly awaiting for the remainder of your crusading armies to arrive,"" Kassig's purported executioner says in the video, addressing Obama and the West.

The U.S. and coalition forces have been bombing Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq for weeks, but no ground troops are deployed.

Kassig's parents, Ed and Paula Kassig, released a statement Sunday that they are ""heartbroken"" by the news and pledged ""to keep his legacy alive.""

""We prefer our son is written about and remembered for his important work and the love he shared with friends and family, not in the manner the hostage takers would use to manipulate Americans and further their cause,"" his parents also said.

Last month Kassig's parents released parts of a letter written to them by their son.

""Don't worry dad, if I go down, I won't go thinking anything but what I know to be true. That you and mom love me more than the moon and the stars,"" Peter Kassig wrote.

Over the weekend, the Daily Mail newspaper reported that the British-accented terrorist — dubbed ""Jihadi John"" by British media — alleged to be the executioner of two British and two American hostages was wounded in a coalition airstrike against Islamic State. The British government said it was investigating the report.

The man who speaks in the video released Sunday talks in similarly British-accented English.

British Prime Minister David Cameron said Sunday he was ""horrified"" by the apparent ""cold-blooded murder"" of Kassig.

Kassig is the third American, after journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, to be beheaded by the group, whose tactics are so extreme that al-Qaeda disavowed it earlier this year.

British journalist John Cantile, 43, remains an Islamic State hostage. He last appeared in a video from the group at the end of last month.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest and Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby used almost identical language when pressed by reporters Friday whether or not the expanded military operation against the terrorist group is in fact a war .
“ In the same way that the United States is at war with Al Qaeda and its affiliates … the United States is at war with ISIL , ” Earnest said .
Kirby said “ this is not the Iraq War ” from a decade ago , “ but make no mistake -- we know we are at war with ISIL in the same way we are at war and continue to be at war with Al Qaeda and its affiliates . ”
The comments are a sharp turnaround from how Kerry described the military operation on Thursday . In interviews with CNN and CBS News , Kerry described it as a “ very significant ” and “ major counterterrorism operation. ” He told CBS News that “ war is the wrong terminology . ”
His spokeswoman , Marie Harf , also said she would not “ refer to our efforts ” as part of the “ war on terrorism . ”
Kerry ’ s comments , though , stirred confusion on Capitol Hill , coming a day after President Obama announced plans to expand airstrikes in Iraq and authorize them in Syria , while dispatching hundreds more U.S. military personnel .
Obama called for a coalition of nations to ultimately “ destroy ” the growing terror network . Meanwhile , the CIA confirmed that its latest estimates show the Islamic State has as many as 31,500 fighters across Iraq and Syria . That ’ s close to the estimated size of the Taliban force in 2001 .
Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz. , and other lawmakers suggested Kerry ’ s comments did not square with Obama ’ s stated goal of defeating the vast terror network .
“ It ’ s hard to find a response to that , ” McCain told Fox News on Thursday night , when asked about Kerry ’ s comments . “ Then what was the president talking about [ Wednesday ] night ? ”
Kerry was n't the only one having a hard time describing the mission on Thursday . National Security Adviser Susan Rice likewise told CNN on Thursday she was n't sure whether it should be called a war or a `` sustained counterterrorism campaign . ''
Senior State Department officials stressed to Fox News on Friday that Kerry 's comments were consistent with what other senior U.S. officials were saying at the time , and made clear that the secretary remains on the same page as the rest of the administration .
`` This was a deliberate , administration-wide adjustment in language , '' a senior State Department official told Fox News , `` which Secretary Kerry would have also used today had he been asked . ''
House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul , R-Texas , said earlier Friday that the semantics over what to call the operation “ weakens the mission . ”
“ Words matter , ” McCaul said . He claimed the administration was being careful with its language because the terror group defies Obama ’ s “ campaign narrative ” about ending the war on terrorism and putting Al Qaeda on the run .
“ ISIL clearly hasn ’ t gotten the memo that I think John Kerry did , ” McCaul said .
But in the Pentagon and White House briefings Friday afternoon , it appeared the administration was backing off the earlier characterization .
Earnest clarified that the operation is not a case of the United States acting alone against the Islamic State , since the Islamic State , he said , is waging a war against the international community .

The family of American Steven Sotloff had a message Wednesday for the notorious leader of the terror group ISIS , asking him to answer for the sin he committed with the beheading of the journalist .
Sotloff 's family broke its silence the same day U.S. intelligence officials said the videotaped execution was authentic .
`` I have a message for Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi , '' family spokesman Barak Barfi told reporters in Arabic , reading from a statement . `` Where is your mercy ? ''
`` Wayluk , '' Barfi said , using an Arabic phrase that roughly translates to committing a great sin .
The statement went on to cite passages from the Quran , asking al-Baghdadi why he violated the tenets .

`` I am here debating you with kindness . I do n't have a sword in my hand , and I am ready for your answer , '' according to the statement read by Barfi .
In English , Barfi told reporters gathered outside the Sotloff family 's home in Miami : `` Today , we grieve . This week , we mourn . But we will emerge from this ordeal ... We will not allow our enemies to hold us hostage with the sole weapons they possess , fear . ''
The statement came just hours after President Barack Obama said the United States will not be intimidated by the killers of two American journalists .
`` Those who make the mistake of harming Americans will learn that we will not forget ... that our reach is long and that justice will be served , '' Obama said during a news conference in Estonia , where he was meeting with leaders of the Baltic nations .
The killing is the second beheading of an American journalist in two weeks , and the militant group said it 's a result of Obama 's decision to conduct airstrikes in Iraq against ISIS , which calls itself the Islamic State .
The goal of the United States is to `` degrade and destroy '' the capabilities of ISIS in Iraq and Syria , `` it 's not contain , '' Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told CNN 's Jim Sciutto
`` It makes you sick to your stomach , but it again reminds you of the brutality and barbarism that is afoot in some places in the world , '' Hagel said . `` ... It wo n't just recede into the gray recesses of history until we stop it . ''
All options -- with the exception of a ground invasion -- are on the table to address the threat posed by ISIS , Hagel said .
Those options include possible airstrikes in Syria , where ISIS has established a stronghold in and around the northeastern city of Raqqa .
But there is a question of just how long it will take to defeat ISIS .

`` This , as the President has said , is going to have to be a sustained effort . And it 's going to take time , and it will probably go beyond even this administration to get to the point of defeat , '' Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer .
Vice President Joe Biden added his own voice to the calls for justice , saying the United States will pursue the killers `` to the gates of hell .
`` As a nation , we are united , and when people harm Americans , we do n't retreat , we do n't forget , '' he said at an appearance near Portsmouth , New Hampshire .
`` We take care of those who are grieving . And when that 's finished , they should know we will follow them to the gates of hell until they are brought to justice , because hell is where they will reside . Hell is where they will reside . ''
In a scene eerily similar to an earlier video of the death of U.S journalist James Foley , Sotloff kneels in the desert , dressed in an orange prison-style jumpsuit . A masked `` executioner '' lords over him , wielding a knife .
`` I 'm back , Obama , and I 'm back because of your arrogant foreign policy toward the Islamic State , '' the executioner says . `` Just as your missiles continue to strike our people , our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people . ''
The executioner appears to be the same person , and the location of the two killings appears to be similar , probably in or around Raqqa , one of the safest areas for ISIS , said Peter Neumann , a professor at King 's College London .
The journalist speaks ; the executioner speaks . Then the victim is beheaded .
In the video released Tuesday , a British hostage is shown after the beheading of Sotloff , just as Sotloff was shown in Foley 's video .
The UK said it attempted to rescue one of its citizens held by ISIS `` some time ago '' but failed .

`` This country will never give into terrorism ... a country like ours will not be cowed by these barbaric killers , '' Prime Minister David Cameron said .
This summer , several dozen of the most elite U.S. commandos flew into Syria but could n't find the hostages , including Sotloff and Foley , a U.S. official told CNN last month .
Speaking Wednesday , Obama addressed his much-criticized statement last week that he has no strategy on ISIS . He said he was referring to a military strategy in Syria that `` might '' require congressional approval .
`` Our objective is clear . That is to degrade and destroy ( ISIS ) so it 's no longer a threat , '' he said . `` We can accomplish that . It 's going to take some time , it 's going to take some effort . ''
Obama said the world needs a regional strategy to defeat the group .

""I am here debating you with kindness. I don't have a sword in my hand, and I am ready for your answer,"" according to the statement read by Barfi.

In English, Barfi told reporters gathered outside the Sotloff family's home in Miami: ""Today, we grieve. This week, we mourn. But we will emerge from this ordeal ... We will not allow our enemies to hold us hostage with the sole weapons they possess, fear.""

'We will not forget'

The statement came just hours after President Barack Obama said the United States will not be intimidated by the killers of two American journalists.

""Those who make the mistake of harming Americans will learn that we will not forget ... that our reach is long and that justice will be served,"" Obama said during a news conference in Estonia, where he was meeting with leaders of the Baltic nations.

The killing is the second beheading of an American journalist in two weeks, and the militant group said it's a result of Obama's decision to conduct airstrikes in Iraq against ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State.

The goal of the United States is to ""degrade and destroy"" the capabilities of ISIS in Iraq and Syria, ""it's not contain,"" Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told CNN's Jim Sciutto

""It makes you sick to your stomach, but it again reminds you of the brutality and barbarism that is afoot in some places in the world,"" Hagel said. ""... It won't just recede into the gray recesses of history until we stop it.""

Hagel: Options on the table

All options -- with the exception of a ground invasion -- are on the table to address the threat posed by ISIS, Hagel said.

Those options include possible airstrikes in Syria, where ISIS has established a stronghold in and around the northeastern city of Raqqa.

But there is a question of just how long it will take to defeat ISIS.

""This, as the President has said, is going to have to be a sustained effort. And it's going to take time, and it will probably go beyond even this administration to get to the point of defeat,"" Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken told CNN's Wolf Blitzer.

Vice President Joe Biden added his own voice to the calls for justice, saying the United States will pursue the killers "" to the gates of hell.

""As a nation, we are united, and when people harm Americans, we don't retreat, we don't forget,"" he said at an appearance near Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

""We take care of those who are grieving. And when that's finished, they should know we will follow them to the gates of hell until they are brought to justice, because hell is where they will reside. Hell is where they will reside.""

The video

The video of Sotloff's execution was posted online Tuesday.

In a scene eerily similar to an earlier video of the death of U.S journalist James Foley, Sotloff kneels in the desert, dressed in an orange prison-style jumpsuit. A masked ""executioner"" lords over him, wielding a knife.

""I'm back, Obama, and I'm back because of your arrogant foreign policy toward the Islamic State,"" the executioner says. ""Just as your missiles continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people.""

The executioner appears to be the same person, and the location of the two killings appears to be similar, probably in or around Raqqa, one of the safest areas for ISIS, said Peter Neumann, a professor at King's College London.

""It is almost the exact same choreography,"" Neumann said.

The journalist speaks; the executioner speaks. Then the victim is beheaded.

In the video released Tuesday, a British hostage is shown after the beheading of Sotloff, just as Sotloff was shown in Foley's video.

British rescue attempt

The UK said it attempted to rescue one of its citizens held by ISIS ""some time ago"" but failed.

UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond provided scant details of the rescue attempt or any other plans in the works.

""You wouldn't expect me to discuss various options that we will be considering,"" he said. ""But I can assure you that we will look at every possible option to protect this person.""

Britain echoed the same sentiment as Obama.

""This country will never give into terrorism ... a country like ours will not be cowed by these barbaric killers,"" Prime Minister David Cameron said.

This summer, several dozen of the most elite U.S. commandos flew into Syria but couldn't find the hostages, including Sotloff and Foley, a U.S. official told CNN last month.

'Degrade and destroy'

Speaking Wednesday, Obama addressed his much-criticized statement last week that he has no strategy on ISIS. He said he was referring to a military strategy in Syria that ""might"" require congressional approval.

""Our objective is clear. That is to degrade and destroy (ISIS) so it's no longer a threat,"" he said. ""We can accomplish that. It's going to take some time, it's going to take some effort.""

Obama said the world needs a regional strategy to defeat the group.

""We've been putting together a strategy that was designed to do a number of things. ... What we have to make sure is we have a regional strategy in place,"" he said.",www.cnn.com,left,mR55ONkBeM5vdzPj

isis,Washington Times,2,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/17/inside-the-ring-cia-goes-to-war/,CIA goes to war against Islamic State,2014-09-17,Bill Gertz,"Behind the scenes of the U.S. military preparations for airstrikes in Iraq and Syria against the al Qaeda offshoot terrorist group Islamic State , the CIA is gearing up for new drone strikes and a surge in intelligence-gathering operations to support it , according to U.S. officials .
The agency is beefing up its presence in countries near Syria , including Jordan , as part of increased U.S. military operations in the region , said officials close to the agency . Liaison with regional spy services also is being increased .
The agency is slated to provide traditional clandestine support to the U.S. military through intelligence-gathering on Islamic State leaders , training bases , communications networks and other targets . The agency also is expected to set up new Predator and Reaper drone bases .
The agency already is supplying intelligence gathered from Islamic State social-media accounts , both official and unofficial , on outlets such as Twitter and Facebook . The social media networks are a moving target but have provided some valuable intelligence and targeting data .
The National Security Agency also is involved in electronic efforts to locate and target Islamic State leaders .
But CIA-operated missile-firing drones have proved to be some of the U.S. ’ most effective counterterrorism tools .
SEE ALSO : State Department downplayed Islamic State threat , privately ramped up security
The aircraft have had a devastating impact — both in killing terrorist leaders inside their residences or vehicles , and as psychological influence , namely , instilling fear among terrorists .
U.S. drone attacks have forced terrorists to remain under cover and limit their public exposure and movement . The aircraft have forced terrorists to remain on constant alert for the signature hum of propeller-driven Predators and Reapers , never knowing whether the drones are unarmed surveillance aircraft , or whether the next sound they hear will be the blast of a Maverick missile hitting their position .
Analysts say drone strikes over the longer term have demoralized the Islamist terrorist groups that have been targeted .
The CIA has scored major successes using drones against al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan for more than a decade , and many analysts credit the aerial strikes with severely weakening al Qaeda central .
The CIA ’ s major shift to drone operations has prompted some agency critics to comment that the CIA is becoming too much of a counterterrorism agency at the expense of its traditional spying missions . Agency defenders say the CIA is doing both jobs well .
In recent month , CIA drone operations in Southwest Asia were scaled back by the Obama administration , under pressure from Pakistan after Islamabad complained that too many civilians were being killed by the strikes .
Under current rules , drone strikes require a relatively high level of confidence in the identification of a target before missile strikes are carried out , a standard that requires good intelligence from all sources — aircraft , satellites and people .
The agency ’ s role in Syria and Iraq will be similar to the CIA ’ s significant covert missions in counterterrorism operations in Yemen and Somalia , in support of U.S. commandos and other military forces .
The CIA is reviewing a highly classified report by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence that , according to sources close to the panel , will largely support the Obama administration ’ s version of events surrounding the Sept. 11 , 2012 , terrorist attacks on the U.S. diplomatic mission and CIA annex in Benghazi , Libya .
The report is expected to be released “ in the coming days , ” and will contain “ additional views ” by Democrats and Republicans who challenge some of its findings , said committee spokeswoman Susan Phalen .
According to congressional sources familiar with the report , the final unclassified version is expected to largely exonerate the Obama administration of covering up and lying about the attack that killed four Americans , including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens .
Some Republicans on the committee are said to be upset that the panel ’ s chairman , Rep. Mike Rogers , Michigan Republican , did not allow dissenting views to be adequately represented in the main report .
One senior congressional insider said Mr. Rogers , who will step down as chairman at the end of the year , has been overly accommodating to Democrats .
Ms. Phalen , the committee spokeswoman , defended Mr. Rogers ’ handling of the report . The committee held a business meeting to consider adopting the report and no one suggested , request or otherwise sought changes , she said , adding that members were given two days to file additional , minority or supplemental views .
Minority panel members submitted additional comments to the report , “ but no other majority members took advantage of the opportunity to submit views , ” Ms. Phalen said .
Mr. Rogers also has been highly critical of some fellow Republicans in the House , notably Rep. Darrell Issa of California , chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that has been hammering the Obama administration on several issues such as the IRS targeting conservative groups .
Although the House intelligence report is still classified , key elements have been leaked .
For example , Rep. Mike Thompson , California Democrat and intelligence committee member , last month told the San Francisco Chronicle that the report exonerates U.S. intelligence agencies by stating that they were warned about an increased threat of attack but lacked specific details to stop the Sept. 11 assaults .
Mr. Thompson said the report will identify the attackers as a mixed group that included al Qaeda-affiliated militias and former supporters of Moammar Gadhafi .

The agency is beefing up its presence in countries near Syria, including Jordan, as part of increased U.S. military operations in the region, said officials close to the agency. Liaison with regional spy services also is being increased.

The agency is slated to provide traditional clandestine support to the U.S. military through intelligence-gathering on Islamic State leaders, training bases, communications networks and other targets. The agency also is expected to set up new Predator and Reaper drone bases.

The agency already is supplying intelligence gathered from Islamic State social-media accounts, both official and unofficial, on outlets such as Twitter and Facebook. The social media networks are a moving target but have provided some valuable intelligence and targeting data.

The National Security Agency also is involved in electronic efforts to locate and target Islamic State leaders.

But CIA-operated missile-firing drones have proved to be some of the U.S.’ most effective counterterrorism tools.

The aircraft have had a devastating impact — both in killing terrorist leaders inside their residences or vehicles, and as psychological influence, namely, instilling fear among terrorists.

U.S. drone attacks have forced terrorists to remain under cover and limit their public exposure and movement. The aircraft have forced terrorists to remain on constant alert for the signature hum of propeller-driven Predators and Reapers, never knowing whether the drones are unarmed surveillance aircraft, or whether the next sound they hear will be the blast of a Maverick missile hitting their position.

Analysts say drone strikes over the longer term have demoralized the Islamist terrorist groups that have been targeted.

The CIA has scored major successes using drones against al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan for more than a decade, and many analysts credit the aerial strikes with severely weakening al Qaeda central.

The CIA’s major shift to drone operations has prompted some agency critics to comment that the CIA is becoming too much of a counterterrorism agency at the expense of its traditional spying missions. Agency defenders say the CIA is doing both jobs well.

In recent month, CIA drone operations in Southwest Asia were scaled back by the Obama administration, under pressure from Pakistan after Islamabad complained that too many civilians were being killed by the strikes.

Under current rules, drone strikes require a relatively high level of confidence in the identification of a target before missile strikes are carried out, a standard that requires good intelligence from all sources — aircraft, satellites and people.

The agency’s role in Syria and Iraq will be similar to the CIA’s significant covert missions in counterterrorism operations in Yemen and Somalia, in support of U.S. commandos and other military forces.

A CIA spokesman declined to comment.

HOUSE INTEL ON BENGHAZI

The CIA is reviewing a highly classified report by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence that, according to sources close to the panel, will largely support the Obama administration’s version of events surrounding the Sept. 11, 2012, terrorist attacks on the U.S. diplomatic mission and CIA annex in Benghazi, Libya.

The report is expected to be released “in the coming days,” and will contain “additional views” by Democrats and Republicans who challenge some of its findings, said committee spokeswoman Susan Phalen.

According to congressional sources familiar with the report, the final unclassified version is expected to largely exonerate the Obama administration of covering up and lying about the attack that killed four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.

Some Republicans on the committee are said to be upset that the panel’s chairman, Rep. Mike Rogers, Michigan Republican, did not allow dissenting views to be adequately represented in the main report.

One senior congressional insider said Mr. Rogers, who will step down as chairman at the end of the year, has been overly accommodating to Democrats.

Ms. Phalen, the committee spokeswoman, defended Mr. Rogers’ handling of the report. The committee held a business meeting to consider adopting the report and no one suggested, request or otherwise sought changes, she said, adding that members were given two days to file additional, minority or supplemental views.

Minority panel members submitted additional comments to the report, “but no other majority members took advantage of the opportunity to submit views,” Ms. Phalen said.

Mr. Rogers also has been highly critical of some fellow Republicans in the House, notably Rep. Darrell Issa of California, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that has been hammering the Obama administration on several issues such as the IRS targeting conservative groups.

Although the House intelligence report is still classified, key elements have been leaked.

For example, Rep. Mike Thompson, California Democrat and intelligence committee member, last month told the San Francisco Chronicle that the report exonerates U.S. intelligence agencies by stating that they were warned about an increased threat of attack but lacked specific details to stop the Sept. 11 assaults.

Mr. Thompson said the report will identify the attackers as a mixed group that included al Qaeda-affiliated militias and former supporters of Moammar Gadhafi. He also revealed that the report will state that no U.S. official ordered a military “stand-down” that prevented a rescue or counterattack, and that no illegal activity or arms transfers were taking place with the help of U.S. personnel.

One of the unanswered questions about the Benghazi attack is what role was played by more than a dozen CIA officers and contractors operating out of the Benghazi annex.

SNOWDEN FALLOUT

The director of the National Counterterrorism Center told Congress on Wednesday that gathering intelligence on terrorism threats has become more difficult as a result of disclosures of National Security Agency documents by renegade NSA contractor Edward Snowden.

“The final point I’ll make on this is that identifying and disrupting threats is increasingly challenging,” Matthew Olsen, the center’s director, said during a hearing of the House Committee on Homeland Security.

“The groups are adapting their tactics to overcome our defenses, to avoid our intelligence collection,” he said. “They’re looking for simpler, less-sophisticated attacks that are on a smaller scale and that are easier to pull off, such as the al-Shabab attack at the Westgate Mall last year in Nairobi.”

Mr. Olsen said that “terrorists are changing how they communicate” in the aftermath of Snowden’s release of electronic intelligence-gathering methods through pilfered NSA documents released to the press.

“They are moving to more secure communication platforms,” Mr. Olsen said. “They are adopting encryption. And they are avoiding electronic communications altogether. We see this in our reporting.

isis,CNN (Web News),0,http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/11/politics/jeb-bush-isis-speech/index.html,Jeb Bush calls for 'no-fly zone' in Syria,2015-08-11,Ashley Killough,"Simi Valley , California ( CNN ) Jeb Bush , laying out his strategy to combat ISIS on Tuesday , called for establishing a no-fly zone over Syria , defeating President Bashar al-Assad 's regime , and embedding U.S. troops with Iraqi forces , all the while expanding U.S. engagement across the globe .
In a foreign policy address at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library , Bush invoked the former president 's description of communism to label ISIS `` the focus of evil in the modern world . ''
The Republican presidential candidate also sharpened his attacks on President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for supporting the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from Iraq , a decision that he said was made out of `` blind haste . ''
`` So eager to be the history-makers , they failed to be the peacemakers , '' Bush said . `` Rushing away from danger can be every bit as unwise as rushing into danger , and the costs have been grievous . ''
Bush , a former two-term governor of Florida , vowed to be `` unyielding '' in the pursuit to stamp out the `` barbarians of ISIS , '' a strategy that will hinge on greater military strength .
`` I assure you : the day that I become president will be the day that we turn this around , and begin rebuilding the armed forces of the United States , '' he said .
Establishing a no-fly zone and other `` safe zones '' in Syria , Bush said , would not only aid in the fight against ISIS but would also help protect Syrians from Assad .
`` Defeating ISIS requires defeating Assad , but we have to make sure that his regime is not replaced by something as bad or worse , '' he said , adding that he would `` draw the moderates together and back them up as one force . ''
In Iraq , Bush said he would embed U.S. Marines and soldiers with Iraqi forces rather than simply training them , but he stressed there 's no need at this point for a `` major commitment of American combat forces '' on the ground .
He also called for stepping up support for the Kurdish Peshmerga , providing forward air controllers on the ground to help make air strikes more accurate , and make `` serious diplomatic efforts '' to ensure that the Shiites , Sunnis and Kurds in Iraq can build a stable government .
`` Instead of simply reacting to each new move the terrorists choose to make , we will use every advantage we have to take the offensive , to keep it , and to prevail , '' he said .
Like Obama has tried , Bush would also attempt to work with social media companies to address online recruitment efforts by ISIS on websites like Facebook and Twitter .
`` It 's a time when mass murderers have Twitter handles , Facebook and Instagram pages , using these to add a veneer of glamor to their exploits , '' he said .
Over the course of the year , Bush has been steadfast in blaming Obama for America 's foreign policy woes , attributing the rise of ISIS and other threats , like Russia and Iran , to what he calls the president 's policy of `` pulling back . ''
His brother , former President George W. Bush , signed the security agreement in 2008 that called for U.S. troops to leave Iraqi cities by 2009 and be out of the country entirely by 2011 . However , he left it to Obama to determine the pace of the withdrawal and negotiate any residual force .
Jeb Bush has also said in the past he favors sending special forces and embedding them with the Syrian Free Army , though he did not reiterate that position Tuesday .
Another key part of his speech was a push to diminish Iran 's influence in the region and a biting critique of the Iran nuclear deal , calling it `` a deal unwise in the extreme , with a regime that is untrustworthy in the extreme . ''
`` It should be rejected by the Congress of the United States of America , '' he said forcefully , adding that if the deal is n't rejected , he would `` begin that process immediately '' of undoing if elected president .
Like many other GOP presidential candidates , he 's called for the U.S. to join with other Arab nations to create an alliance that goes after ISIS . That group , he says , would be aided by U.S. air and military power .
Aside from embedding troops , Bush 's proposals so far do n't outline a significant departure from current operations . The U.S. , for example , is already part of a coalition of allies that 's hitting ISIS with air strikes , and it has troops in Iraq training the army there .
Like other governors running for president , Bush has been studying up on foreign policy and trying to craft an approach that distances himself from his brother and father . At a foreign policy speech in Detroit this past February , when Bush was technically in the exploratory phase of running for president , he stressed that he was his `` own man . ''
Critics , however , were quick to point to the list of Bush 's foreign policy advisers that includes many of the same names that advised George W. Bush and George H.W . Bush .
The candidate had to play damage control a few months later after he struggled for days to answer whether he would have gone into Iraq , like his brother , knowing what we know now about the faulty intelligence that in part led to the war .
Ultimately Bush said he would not have gone in -- and reiterated that sentiment last week in the debate , saying it was a `` mistake '' to invade Iraq -- but the stumble resulted in weeklong coverage and raised questions about whether Bush could truly separate himself from his brother 's legacy .
In his speech , he acknowledged the faulty intelligence that led to the war in Iraq , saying `` no leader or policymaker involved will claim to have gotten everything right in the region , Iraq especially '' but he hailed the 2007 surge as a hallmark moment and `` the turning point we had all been waiting for . ''
Jake Sullivan , Clinton 's top foreign policy adviser , labeled Bush 's speech `` a pretty bold attempt to rewrite history and reassign responsibility . ''
In a call with reporters , Sullivan tied the roots of ISIS back to the Bush administration and said the group did not grow `` out of a vacuum '' but rather out of al Qaeda in Iraq , which sprung up because of the Bush administration 's invasion of Iraq and subsequent mistakes , like disbanding the Iraqi army and banishing Sunnis who later became insurgents , he said .","Simi Valley, California (CNN) Jeb Bush, laying out his strategy to combat ISIS on Tuesday, called for establishing a no-fly zone over Syria, defeating President Bashar al-Assad's regime, and embedding U.S. troops with Iraqi forces, all the while expanding U.S. engagement across the globe.

In a foreign policy address at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, Bush invoked the former president's description of communism to label ISIS ""the focus of evil in the modern world.""

The Republican presidential candidate also sharpened his attacks on President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for supporting the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from Iraq, a decision that he said was made out of ""blind haste.""

""So eager to be the history-makers, they failed to be the peacemakers,"" Bush said. ""Rushing away from danger can be every bit as unwise as rushing into danger, and the costs have been grievous.""

Bush, a former two-term governor of Florida, vowed to be ""unyielding"" in the pursuit to stamp out the ""barbarians of ISIS,"" a strategy that will hinge on greater military strength.

""I assure you: the day that I become president will be the day that we turn this around, and begin rebuilding the armed forces of the United States,"" he said.

Establishing a no-fly zone and other ""safe zones"" in Syria, Bush said, would not only aid in the fight against ISIS but would also help protect Syrians from Assad.

""Defeating ISIS requires defeating Assad, but we have to make sure that his regime is not replaced by something as bad or worse,"" he said, adding that he would ""draw the moderates together and back them up as one force.""

President Obama's prime-time speech outlining his plan to broaden a U.S.-led offensive against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria prompted generally cautious support from the editorial pages of major newspapers across the country this morning.

As we reported last night, Obama told the nation: ""Our objective is clear: We will degrade, and ultimately destroy, ISIL through a comprehensive and sustained counter-terrorism strategy.""

The United States ""will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country, wherever they are,"" he said.

Here's a sampling of reaction in op-eds in major dailies today:

The New York Times (Peter Baker):

""It will be a significantly different kind of war — not like Iraq or Afghanistan, where many tens of thousands of American troops were still deployed when Mr. Obama took the oath nearly six years ago. And even though Mr. Obama compared it to the small-scale, sporadic strikes against isolated terrorists in places like Yemen and Somalia, it will not be exactly like those either. ""Instead, the widening battle with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria will be the next chapter in a grueling, generational struggle that has kept the United States at war in one form or another since that day 13 years ago on Thursday when hijacked airplanes shattered America's sense of its own security.""

The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel:

""Obama has used military force judiciously throughout his presidency, but there are times when the threat is so clear that nothing else suffices. This is one of those times. ""There is no way at this early stage to know how exactly the American response will unfold or how the threat will mutate in the coming months. The success of the campaign depends on the reliability of U.S. partners in the region.""

The Los Angeles Times: ""The president is right about the shared global interests in stopping the Islamic State. After a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, though, the decision to re-engage militarily in the region is a fraught and complicated one. As he moves forward, he needs to be mindful of the dangers of mission creep and assiduous in pressing other countries to help in the effort. Finally, he should seek congressional endorsement for any sustained use of military force against this enemy.""

Contrary to their claim , there is no such thing as a right to enrich . This is absolutely unfounded . There is no such right . I am well aware that I am not at the negotiating table anymore , but I think it ’ s important to send a signal to everybody who is there that there can not be a deal unless there is a clear set of restrictions on Iran . The preference would be no enrichment . The potential fallback position would be such little enrichment that they could not break out . So , little or no enrichment has always been my position .
JG : Am I wrong in saying that the Obama administration ’ s negotiators have a more flexible understanding of this issue at the moment ?
HRC : I don ’ t want to speak for them , but I would argue that Iran , through the voice of the supreme leader , has taken a very maximalist position—he wants 190,000 centrifuges and the right to enrich . And some in our Congress , and some of our best friends , have taken the opposite position—absolutely no enrichment . I think in a negotiation you need to be very clear about what it is going to take to move the other side . I think at the moment there is a big debate going on in Tehran about what they can or should do in order to get relief from the sanctions . It ’ s my understanding that we still have a united P5+1 position , which is intensive inspections , very clear limits on what they can do in their facilities that they would permitted to operate , and then how they handle this question of enrichment , whether it ’ s done from the outside , or whether it can truly be constrained to meet what I think our standard should be of little-to-no enrichment . That ’ s what this negotiation is about .
JG : But there is no sign that the Iranians are willing to pull back—freezing in place is the farthest they seem to be willing to go . Am I wrong ?
HRC : We don ’ t know . I think there ’ s a political debate . I think you had the position staked out by the supreme leader that they ’ re going to get to do what they want to do , and that they don ’ t have any intention of having a nuclear weapon but they nevertheless want 190,000 centrifuges ( laughs ) . I think the political , non-clerical side of the equation is basically saying , “ Look , you know , getting relief from these sanctions is economically and politically important to us . We have our hands full in Syria and Iraq , just to name two places , maybe increasingly in Lebanon , and who knows what ’ s going to happen with us and Hamas . So what harm does it do to have a very strict regime that we can live under until we determine that maybe we won ’ t have to any longer ? ” That , I think , is the other side of the argument .","What follows is a transcript of our conversation. It has been edited for clarity but not for length, as you will see. Two other things to look for: First, the masterful way in which Clinton says she has drawn no conclusions about events in Syria and elsewhere, and then draws rigorously reasoned conclusions. Second, her fascinating and complicated analysis of the Muslim Brotherhood's ill-fated dalliance with democracy.

JEFFREY GOLDBERG: It seems that you’ve shifted your position on Iran’s nuclear ambitions. By [chief U.S. negotiator] Wendy Sherman’s definition of maximalism, you’ve taken a fairly maximalist position—little or no enrichment for Iran. Are you taking a harder line than your former colleagues in the Obama administration are taking on this matter?

HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: It’s a consistent line. I’ve always been in the camp that held that they did not have a right to enrichment. Contrary to their claim, there is no such thing as a right to enrich. This is absolutely unfounded. There is no such right. I am well aware that I am not at the negotiating table anymore, but I think it’s important to send a signal to everybody who is there that there cannot be a deal unless there is a clear set of restrictions on Iran.

More On This...

Reuters reported Monday that France has offered to take part in airstrikes against Iraq, and the Associated Press reported, citing a French official, that jets from that country were prepared to carry out reconnaissance flights beginning Monday.

""The terrorist threat is global and the response must be global,"" French President Francois Hollande said in opening Monday's conference. ""There is no time to lose."" French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius acknowledged that a number of the countries at the table Monday had ""very probably"" financed ISIS's advances.

Muslim-majority countries are considered vital to any operation to prevent the militants from gaining more territory in Iraq and Syria. Western officials have made clear they consider Assad to be part of the problem, and U.S. officials opposed France's attempt to invite Iran.

In an exclusive interview on Sunday with The Associated Press in Paris, Iraq's President Fouad Massoum — a Kurd, whose role in the government is largely ceremonial — expressed regret that Iran was not attending the conference.

Massoum noted ""sensitivities between some countries and Iran.""

He also seemed not to welcome the possible participation Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia in air strikes in Iraqi territory.

""It is not necessary that they participate in air strikes; what is important is that they participate in the decisions of this conference,"" he said, underscoring Baghdad's closeness to Iran and how tensions among the regional powers could complicate the process of forming a Sunni alliance.

Speaking in his first interview since becoming Iraqi prime minister, Haider al-Abadi told state-run al-Iraqiyya in comments aired Sunday that he had given approvals to France to use Iraqi airspace and said all such authorizations would have to come from Baghdad.

Earlier, Fabius said quick action was vital, insisting there was no comparison with the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, which France vocally opposed.

""It's the same geographic area but that's the only similarity,"" Fabius told France Info radio on Monday. ""When you are a political leader you have to measure the cost of inaction.""

U.S. Central Command has carried out more than 150 airstrikes against ISIS targets in Iraq since August 8. The militant group has responded by beheading three Western hostages, most recently British aid worker David Haines, whose killing was shown in a graphic video released Saturday.

The death toll would be bad enough alone , but that one of the assailants entered Europe ( in October , via Greece ) as a Syrian `` refugee '' compounds the fear and dread resulting from the massacre : Hundreds of thousands of migrants ( two out of three of whom are male ) have poured into Europe this year , and a majority are from ( Muslim ) Syria , Iraq and Afghanistan . Some of the other attackers were French- or Belgian-born Muslims .
French President François Hollande , the following day , addressed his people , denouncing an `` act of war that was prepared , organized , and planned from the outside , with complicity within our country that our investigation will allow us to establish . '' He named the entity behind the perpetrators : the `` terrorist army , Daesh '' -- ISIS -- `` a jihadist army , '' and promised that France would act `` pitilessly against Daesh barbarians . '' The `` barbarians ' '' motive ? They sought to strike at `` the values we defend all over the world , at that which we are , a free country that speaks to the entire planet . ''
Of the other potential motives -- avenging the ongoing French bombing raids against ISIS in Iraq and Syria , plus the two-year French anti-Islamist military intervention in West Africa -- Hollande had nothing to say .
ISIS `` contained , '' President Obama , for his part , having the previous day declared ISIS `` contained , '' called the ISIS massacre `` an attack on all of humanity and the universal values that we share '' carried out by those with `` a hateful vision . '' Just what sort of `` hateful vision '' he declined to specify . ( Not that we , by this point , expected him to . ) Clearly , though , our values are not as universal as he would have us think .
ISIS , however , is never coy or evasive in explaining why it does what it does , and emitted a communique of arresting clarity explaining its motives : `` a group of believers from the soldiers of the Caliphate . . . set out targeting the capital of prostitution and vice , the lead-carrier of the cross in Europe -- Paris . '' They did so `` hoping to be killed for Allah 's sake , doing so in support of His religion , . . . His Prophet . . . and His allies . '' They `` cast terror into the hearts of crusaders in their very own homeland , '' and then detonated their suicide belts with the result that `` Allah granted them what they desired '' -- martyrdom . France and its allies , the text went on to state , `` will continue to be at the top of the target list for the Islamic State . . . as long as they partake in their crusader campaign , as long as they dare to curse our Prophet , and as long as they boast about their war against Islam in France and their strikes against Muslims in the lands of the Caliphate with their jets . ''
Any rational individual hoping to make sense of why so many people lost their lives in Paris last Friday night could do no better than dispense with the proclamations issued by presidents Hollande and Obama and just read ISIS 's explanation . The facts it presents are clear and indisputable :
ISIS attacked France because France is leading a `` crusade , '' bombarding it ( in Syria and Iraq ) and ( unmentioned but surely relevant ) crushing the Islamist insurgency in West Africa . On secularist constitutional grounds , France has banned Islamic headgear from schools as potentially divisive `` ostentatious religious symbols '' and outlawed wearing face-concealing veils in public places as threats to security and national cohesion , as well as being inimical to personal freedom -- the equivalent , for ISIS , of waging a `` war against Islam . '' France stood behind the satirical cartoonists of Charlie Hebdo and free speech ideals after a pair of Islamist brothers assassinated 12 of them last January for repeatedly depicting the Prophet Muhammad , which , for ISIS , amounts to `` cursing '' him . The ISIS assailants sought , and mostly received , death for the sake of their faith -- martyrdom -- just as the Quran promises .
Note the communique 's defiant , triumphal tone -- the tone of victors . Note , concomitantly , the absence of all the factors to which Islamist apologists have ascribed as contributing to Islamist violence committed by French citizens of mostly North African descent in the past ; nary a word about discrimination , racism , lack of opportunity , youth unemployment , police brutality , or poverty in Parisian suburbs . This is not to say that these factors had no role to play in disposing the French-born assailants to play their role in the attacks -- they may have . But the primum mobile for ISIS transpires as unmistakably politico-religious ( natural , given that Islam blends faith and politics ) , buttressed , to be sure , by the virulent excoriations of infidels found in the Quran . France is attacking ISIS in the Middle East ( and thus acting as `` crusaders '' ) and thwarting the unhindered observance of Islam in France . France is , thus , impeding the advance of Islam , the True Religion , and thus must incur God 's wrath .
Now no fair observer of the growing religion-inspired chaos we see around us today would contend that all Muslims , be they in Europe or elsewhere , crave martyrdom and are ready to kill for it , or even pose a security threat . What is clear , though , is that the doctrine of jihad as laid out in the Islamic canon does repeatedly motivate lethal instances of terrorist violence . We do n't need to furrow our brows and deduce this from abstruse pronouncements ; ISIS jihadists themselves are telling us why they are acting , just as al-Qaida once did . They are proudly showing themselves in action : check out , if you can stomach it , ISIS 's own videos .
And lest you labor under the misconception that , as Obama has said , ISIS has nothing to do with Islam , read and share Graeme Wood 's exhaustive account in the Atlantic of the movement and its aims . ISIS is not Islamic ? There exists no Islamic equivalent of the pope to make such a determination . Wood 's report shreds this ridiculous assertion anyway .
That Hollande and Obama choose to avoid such blunt causal attribution makes ( short-sighted ) political sense . France 's population may be , by now , 10 percent Muslim . Obama does not want to alienate Muslim communities in the United States , whose cooperation he needs to track radicalized youths , nor does he wish to endanger American interests abroad by `` demonizing , '' as we are so often inclined to say now , Islam as a whole . We get all that . The underlying assumption , however -- that Muslims must be placated or they may explode into violence -- may be less obvious . In any case , by avoiding the issue -- the jihadist problems the generally accepted Islamic canon presents us with -- our leaders hinder our having conversations we need to have , our asking questions we simply must ask .
Namely , what are we to do about the strongly illiberal convictions held , the data demonstrate , by majorities of Muslims across the Islamic world , convictions that , surely , have stymied any united Muslim attempt to counter ISIS ? Muslim migrants are now entering Europe , unchecked in any meaningful way , in record numbers . Given that Muslim majorities support making Sharia the official law of their lands , believe one must believe in God to be moral and that religious leaders should play a role in politics , hold that wives must obey their husbands , and favor stoning adulterers and putting to death apostates , how , if at all , are Western societies to adapt ? ( Majorities , Pew found , also profess to approve of democracy and religious freedom , which are simply incongruous with the beliefs just canvassed . ) How will peace and comity in our increasingly multicultural , multi-confessional societies be possible if one group adheres to , and acts upon , violent and divisive dogmas inscribed in immutable ancient texts ? What is the best policy Western governments can enact in the Islamic world , given that military intervention has proved disastrous and counterproductive ; supporting secular dictators has resulted , eventually , in morasses of strife and mayhem ; and key Western `` allies '' ( Saudi Arabia , Qatar and Kuwait ) are clearly playing a double game by accepting Western backing yet propagating fundamentalist Islam ? It 's a safe bet that neither Hollande nor Obama has answers to these questions .
If we refuse to address these issues , terrorist attacks will likely multiply and push our politics ever further to the right . We may well then end up in police states , with security organs even more pervasive and intrusive than they are now . Or even more perniciously , confused about what is at stake , we may continue our slide into craven accommodationism , into accepting illiberal beliefs ( and resulting behavior ) as the off-limits patrimony of various religious and national groups , thereby consigning to the dust bin of history once-lauded ideals of universal human rights . ( This is just what `` Islamophobia '' denouncers are after . ) We should always bear in mind that there is only one Universal Declaration on Human Rights , and it grants no exceptions on the basis of religion or culture . That one or another faith happens to boast a majority of nonwhite adherents does not make criticism of that faith racist . Islam in particular has universalist pretensions and so must be liable to criticism by all . We need to junk , finally , the preposterous claim , advanced by the religion 's apologists , that Islam can not motivate violence .
If our politicians wo n't come clean about the parlous juncture at which we find ourselves , we have to . We must regain confidence in , and appreciation for , our Enlightenment and Western values -- reason , equal rights for all ( regardless of race , gender , sexual orientation , or faith ) , and consensus-based decisions and the rule of law established not by ancient texts , but by elected legislatures operating under the aegis of a secular constitution . The societies the West has built , as imperfect as they are , offer such grand prospects for human happiness and prosperity that they are drawing millions from less fortunate lands , millions who may have little understanding of what makes these societies work . We can not betray those seekers of a better ( that is , more secular ) life among them , especially women and children , by jettisoning our values under pressure from accommodationists , who often attack straight thinkers as `` politically incorrect . ''
We either buck up and stand by our Enlightenment values , promoting them with zeal , or we will reap a savage whirlwind and lose all that we cherish .","The Islamist terrorist attacks that took place almost simultaneously in five locations across Paris last Friday night were shocking in scale and unprecedented in Europe over the past decade: 129 killed immediately, 352 injured (of whom 99 are in critical condition), a country-wide state of emergency declared, thousands of troops deployed to Paris, demonstrations forbidden in the Ile-de-France region encompassing the French capital, border checks reimposed.

''
`` Now , make no mistake , this is a difficult mission and it will remain difficult for some time , '' he said during an afternoon press conference . But , he added , `` Our coalition is on the offensive , ISIL is on the defensive and ISIL is going to lose . ''
Obama , flanked by Vice President Joe Biden , Secretary of State John Kerry and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel , outlined the parameters of the request he delivered to Congress earlier that day . He said the bill reflects `` our core objective to destroy ISIL , '' and includes authority for a `` systemic and sustained campaign of airstrikes , '' support and training for forces on the ground and humanitarian assistance .
He made clear , however , that the Authorization for the Use of Military Force , or AUMF , does not call for the deployment of ground troops in Iraq or Syria .
`` I am convinced that the U.S. should not get back into another ground war in the Middle East -- it 's not in our national security interest and not necessary for us to defeat ISIL , '' he said .
The proposal does give the military the `` flexibility '' to confront `` unforeseen circumstances , '' potentially by deploying special forces in the region .
Lawmakers on Capitol Hill received a draft AUMF , a resolution that would formally authorize the already six-month-old U.S. military effort against the militant group .
The joint resolution would limit the President 's authority to wage a military campaign against ISIS to three years and does not authorize `` enduring offensive ground combat operations , '' according to text of the resolution .
In a letter to Congress , Obama explained that the draft resolution would give him the authority to authorize `` ground combat operations in limited circumstances , '' including rescue operations and special forces operations to `` take military action against ISIL leadership . ''
The resolution would also sunset the 2002 AUMF that spawned the Iraq War . Obama withdrew American troops from Iraq in 2011 , but the military authorization remains in effect .
The resolution drafted by the White House does not repeal the 2001 military force authorization that has served as the legal justification for the military campaign against ISIS and other U.S. military efforts to combat terrorism around the world .
The document also specifically notes that ISIS poses a `` grave threat '' to U.S. national security interests and regional stability .
And Obama detailed the ISIS threat in a letter to Congress accompanying the draft legislation .
`` The so-called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ) poses a threat to the people and stability of Iraq , Syria , and the broader Middle East , and to U.S. national security , '' Obama writes . `` It threatens American personnel and facilities located in the region and is responsible for the deaths of U.S. citizens ''
As in the draft resolution , Obama goes on to name the Americans killed in ISIS captivity , `` including James Foley , Steven Sotloff , Abdul-Rahman Peter Kassig , and Kayla Mueller . ''
There is broad support in Congress for a formal AUMF , though lawmakers disagree on the scope of the military powers that should be handed to the President .
House Republican leaders were quick to dismiss the White House draft authorization as too limited , insisting that the President should have fewer limitations .
`` If we are going to defeat this enemy , we need a comprehensive military strategy and a robust authorization , not one that limits our options , '' House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement Tuesday . `` Any authorization for the use of military force must give our military commanders the flexibility and authorities they need to succeed and protect our people ... I have concerns that the president 's request does not meet this standard . ''
Boehner 's No . 2 , Rep. Kevin McCarthy , echoed Boehner 's support for an AUMF as well as his criticism of the limits the White House 's draft would impose .
`` I am prepared to support an Authorization for Use of Military Force ( AUMF ) that provides new legal authorities to go after ISIL and other terrorist groups . However , I will not support efforts that impose undue restrictions on the U.S. military and make it harder to win , '' McCarthy said in a statement .
House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi took the opposite path during a press conference Wednesday .
`` We hope to have bipartisan support for something that would limit the power of the President , but nonetheless protect the American people in a very strong way , '' Pelosi said .
Pelosi added that she hoped the three-year authorization would be longer than needed to defeat ISIS .
Pelosi also offered her support for repealing the 2002 authorization , another provision included in Obama 's draft resolution .
`` I do n't see any reason -- in fact I actively support -- repealing the 2002 authorization . It was based on a false premise , '' Pelosi said . `` Nonetheless , it should go , and it should go now . ''

`` I do really blame Hillary Clinton 's war in Libya , '' Paul said Wednesday on Fox News referring to the NATO campaign to oust Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi authorized by Obama while Clinton was secretary of state .
Libya has erupted into civil war and has become a breeding ground for radical Islamic fighters , many of whom have left to join ISIS 's ranks .
Paul also said the U.S. needs to supply more weapons to Kurdish fighters fighting ISIS in Iraq , but said the U.S. should refrain from getting involved in the war in Syria -- fearing weapons supplied to moderate fighters could get into ISIS 's hands .
Paul has been at odds with his Republican colleagues on many aspects of foreign policy , especially in urging for a more restrained , and not limitless , authority to fight ISIS .
Obama urged Congress during his State of the Union address to formally authorize the military campaign to `` show the world that we are united in this mission '' and Secretary of State John Kerry urged Congress to swiftly pass the resolution .
`` We are strongest as a nation when the Administration and Congress work together on issues as significant as the use of military force , '' Kerry said . `` This is a moment where Congress can make it clear all over the world that no matter differences on certain issues , at home we 're absolutely united and determined in defeating ISIL . ''
Obama again noted in his letter to Congress Wednesday that he already has the authority to fight ISIS , `` I have repeatedly expressed my commitment to working with the Congress to pass a bipartisan authorization for the use of military force '' against ISIS .
Obama also stressed that the White House 's draft resolution would constrain the U.S. military effort and would not authorize `` long-term , large-scale ground combat operations '' like in Iraq and Afghanistan .

Besides the U.S. , the Pentagon says that Bahrain , Qatar , Saudi Arabia , Jordan and the United Arab Emirates `` participated in or supported '' operations against targets associated with the self-declared Islamic State .
U.S. State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki confirmed that `` we informed the Syrian regime directly of our intent to take action through our Ambassador to the United Nations ( Ambassador [ Samantha ] Power ) to the Syrian Permanent Representative to the United Nations .
At a morning Pentagon briefing , Lt. Gen. William Mayville , the Joint Chiefs director of operations , said there were three waves of attacks , and that coalition partners provided combat air patrols and conducted airstrikes as part of the final two waves .
`` We warned Syria not to engage U.S. aircraft . We did not request the regime 's permission . We did not coordinate our actions with the Syrian government . We did not provide advance notification to the Syrians at a military level , or give any indication of our timing on specific targets .

-- The al-Qaida-affiliated Nusra Front , or Jabhat al-Nusra , in northwest Syria .
-- A shadowy group known as Khorasan that the U.S. says is planning an imminent attack against the United States and Western interests .
NPR 's Deborah Amos tells Morning Edition that militants with the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or ISIL , were a major focus of the attacks . The Pentagon said the strikes `` employed 47 [ Tomahawk cruise missiles ] launched from USS Arleigh Burke and USS Philippine Sea operating from international waters in the Red Sea and North Arabian Gulf , as well as U.S. Air Force , Navy and Marine Corps fighter , remotely piloted and bomber aircraft deployed to the U.S. Central Command area of operations . ''
According to Deborah : `` What is striking about this air campaign is that it was expanded to include the Nusra Front .
`` Those strikes took place in northwest Syria . The Nusra Front is an al-Qaida affiliate and has been at odds with ISIS . In fact , some of al-Nusra 's fighters have been at war on the ground with ISIS , joining with more moderate groups against them . ''
NPR 's Tom Bowman says not much is known about the Khorasan group : `` The Pentagon says they took this action to disrupt an imminent attack plotting against the United States by this group that 's made up of seasoned al-Qaida veterans . There were eight strikes around Aleppo targeting this group . [ The Pentagon says ] it had training camps , explosives and munitions productions facility , communications building and also command and control facilities . ''
Gen. Mayville said that `` we 've been watching '' Khorasan and that the group `` clearly is not focused '' on fighting the Syrian regime of President Bashar Assad but instead had been `` putting down roots '' to work toward attacks on the U.S .
Mayville said in the first strike , which began about midnight Syrian time and involved mainly Tomahawk cruise missiles , the U.S. unilaterally hit Khorasan command and control in the country 's northeast . The second wave employed F-22 Raptors in their first combat roles , as well as F-15s , F-16s and B-1 bombers , he said . The third and final wave against Islamic State militants in the east employed F-18 Hornets from the USS George H.W . Bush as well as ground-based F-16s , he said .
Mayville said the majority of support from Arab allies came in the third wave .
He showed journalists `` before and after '' bomb-damage assessment photos and video of various structures that had been hit .
An unnamed U.S. official tells The New York Times that the Khorasan group is led by `` Muhsin al-Fadhli , a senior Qaeda operative who , according to the State Department , was so close to [ Osama ] Bin Laden that he was among a small group of people who knew about the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks before they were launched . '' The Times says :
`` There is almost no public information about the Khorasan group , which was described by several intelligence , law enforcement and military officials as being made up of Qaeda operatives from across the Middle East , South Asia and North Africa . Members of the cell are said to be particularly interested in devising terror plots using concealed explosives . It is unclear who , besides Mr. Fadhli , is part of the Khorasan group . ''
The Wall Street Journal reports : `` So far , more than a dozen airstrikes have hit Islamic State military targets and administrative buildings in Aleppo and Raqqa provinces in the north as well as al Qaeda 's official arm in the country , al Nusra Front in the northwestern city of Idlib , the opposition said . ''
Reuters quotes a resident in Raqqa as saying there is an `` exodus '' from the city in the wake of the bombardment . `` It started in the early hours of the day after the strikes . People are fleeing toward the countryside , '' the resident tells Reuters .
The participation of the partners `` gives the operation some legitimacy — more legitimacy in the region because Arab governments took part . There [ are ] political optics about this operation put together in Washington , '' NPR 's Deborah Amos says , adding that the agreement to participate `` changes the stakes '' for the Arab partners .
The BBC 's security correspondent Frank Gardner speculates that the Islamic State `` will be enraged by this — it has no effective military answers to US air power — so those Arab countries that supported or took part in the action may well now be bracing themselves for possible reprisals . ''
The Associated Press quotes Rami Abdurrahman , head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights , as saying , `` There is confirmed information that there are casualties among Islamic State group members . ''
Speaking on MSNBC , Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby says the U.S. `` is still assessing the effectiveness of these strikes . ''
Later , Gen. Mayville said : `` Last night 's strikes are the beginning of a credible and sustained campaign to destroy '' the Islamic State .","Airstrikes Move To Syria, Target More Than Just ISIS

Updated at 12:50 p.m. ET

In a major escalation of the air campaign against Islamic extremist groups, the U.S. and its Arab allies jointly hit targets inside Syria for the first time.

The New York Times says, ""The intensity of the attacks struck a fierce opening blow against the jihadists of the Islamic State, scattering its forces and damaging the network of facilities it has built in Syria that helped fuel its seizure of a large part of Iraq this year.""

Who Took Part?

Besides the U.S., the Pentagon says that Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates ""participated in or supported"" operations against targets associated with the self-declared Islamic State.

U.S. State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki confirmed that ""we informed the Syrian regime directly of our intent to take action through our Ambassador to the United Nations (Ambassador [Samantha] Power) to the Syrian Permanent Representative to the United Nations.

At a morning Pentagon briefing, Lt. Gen. William Mayville, the Joint Chiefs director of operations, said there were three waves of attacks, and that coalition partners provided combat air patrols and conducted airstrikes as part of the final two waves.

""We warned Syria not to engage U.S. aircraft. We did not request the regime's permission. We did not coordinate our actions with the Syrian government. We did not provide advance notification to the Syrians at a military level, or give any indication of our timing on specific targets. Secretary [of State John] Kerry did not send a letter to the Syrian regime,"" Psaki said.

Who Was Targeted?

-- The Islamic State in its Syrian headquarters of Raqqa.

-- The al-Qaida-affiliated Nusra Front, or Jabhat al-Nusra, in northwest Syria.

-- A shadowy group known as Khorasan that the U.S. says is planning an imminent attack against the United States and Western interests.

NPR's Deborah Amos tells Morning Edition that militants with the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, were a major focus of the attacks. The Pentagon said the strikes ""employed 47 [Tomahawk cruise missiles] launched from USS Arleigh Burke and USS Philippine Sea operating from international waters in the Red Sea and North Arabian Gulf, as well as U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps fighter, remotely piloted and bomber aircraft deployed to the U.S. Central Command area of operations.""

According to Deborah: ""What is striking about this air campaign is that it was expanded to include the Nusra Front.

""Those strikes took place in northwest Syria. The Nusra Front is an al-Qaida affiliate and has been at odds with ISIS. In fact, some of al-Nusra's fighters have been at war on the ground with ISIS, joining with more moderate groups against them.""

NPR's Tom Bowman says not much is known about the Khorasan group: ""The Pentagon says they took this action to disrupt an imminent attack plotting against the United States by this group that's made up of seasoned al-Qaida veterans. There were eight strikes around Aleppo targeting this group. [The Pentagon says] it had training camps, explosives and munitions productions facility, communications building and also command and control facilities.""

Gen. Mayville said that ""we've been watching"" Khorasan and that the group ""clearly is not focused"" on fighting the Syrian regime of President Bashar Assad but instead had been ""putting down roots"" to work toward attacks on the U.S.

Mayville said in the first strike, which began about midnight Syrian time and involved mainly Tomahawk cruise missiles, the U.S. unilaterally hit Khorasan command and control in the country's northeast. The second wave employed F-22 Raptors in their first combat roles, as well as F-15s, F-16s and B-1 bombers, he said. The third and final wave against Islamic State militants in the east employed F-18 Hornets from the USS George H.W. Bush as well as ground-based F-16s, he said.

Mayville said the majority of support from Arab allies came in the third wave.

He showed journalists ""before and after"" bomb-damage assessment photos and video of various structures that had been hit.

An unnamed U.S. official tells The New York Times that the Khorasan group is led by ""Muhsin al-Fadhli, a senior Qaeda operative who, according to the State Department, was so close to [Osama] Bin Laden that he was among a small group of people who knew about the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks before they were launched."" The Times says:

""There is almost no public information about the Khorasan group, which was described by several intelligence, law enforcement and military officials as being made up of Qaeda operatives from across the Middle East, South Asia and North Africa. Members of the cell are said to be particularly interested in devising terror plots using concealed explosives. It is unclear who, besides Mr. Fadhli, is part of the Khorasan group.""

The Wall Street Journal reports: ""So far, more than a dozen airstrikes have hit Islamic State military targets and administrative buildings in Aleppo and Raqqa provinces in the north as well as al Qaeda's official arm in the country, al Nusra Front in the northwestern city of Idlib, the opposition said.""

What Are The Consequences?

Reuters quotes a resident in Raqqa as saying there is an ""exodus"" from the city in the wake of the bombardment. ""It started in the early hours of the day after the strikes. People are fleeing toward the countryside,"" the resident tells Reuters.

The participation of the partners ""gives the operation some legitimacy — more legitimacy in the region because Arab governments took part. There [are] political optics about this operation put together in Washington,"" NPR's Deborah Amos says, adding that the agreement to participate ""changes the stakes"" for the Arab partners.

The BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner speculates that the Islamic State ""will be enraged by this — it has no effective military answers to US air power — so those Arab countries that supported or took part in the action may well now be bracing themselves for possible reprisals.""

The Associated Press quotes Rami Abdurrahman, head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, as saying, ""There is confirmed information that there are casualties among Islamic State group members.""

Speaking on MSNBC, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby says the U.S. ""is still assessing the effectiveness of these strikes.""

Later, Gen. Mayville said: ""Last night's strikes are the beginning of a credible and sustained campaign to destroy"" the Islamic State.",www.npr.org,center,6EUBKJWeXNRUea8a

`` The United States is at war with ISIL in the same way we are at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates , '' White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters today .
At the Pentagon , spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby echoed that assessment : `` This is not the Iraq War , '' he said . `` But make no mistake we know we are at war with ISIL in the same way we are at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates . '' The militant Islamic group goes by the acronym ISIL as well as ISIS and the name of Islamic State .

`` No , '' the U.S. is not at war with ISIS , Secretary of State John Kerry told ███ Thursday in Saudi Arabia . `` We 're engaged in a counter-terrorism operation of a significant order . And counter-terrorism operations can take a long time , they go on . I think 'war ' is the wrong reference term with respect to that . ''

One day after d enying the U.S. is engaged in ""a war"" against ISIS militants, the White House today said a war is in fact underway, indicating it's an extension of the ongoing campaign against Islamic extremists.

""The United States is at war with ISIL in the same way we are at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters today.

""Semantics matter,"" he added.

At the Pentagon, spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby echoed that assessment: ""This is not the Iraq War,"" he said. ""But make no mistake we know we are at war with ISIL in the same way we are at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates."" The militant Islamic group goes by the acronym ISIL as well as ISIS and the name of Islamic State.

The new talking points follow a day of insistence by administration officials that President Obama's new anti-ISIS strategy only amounts to a ""counter-terrorism campaign.""

""No,"" the U.S. is not at war with ISIS, Secretary of State John Kerry told ABC News Thursday in Saudi Arabia. ""We're engaged in a counter-terrorism operation of a significant order. And counter-terrorism operations can take a long time, they go on. I think 'war' is the wrong reference term with respect to that.""

National Security Adviser Susan Rice said since there would be no ""boots on the ground"" - presumably referring to American combat troops in Iraq or Syria - the campaign would not fit the definition of ""war.""

But today a different tune, made all the more noteworthy given Obama's record of distancing himself from his predecessor's ""war on terror"" terminology and repeated insistence that ""core"" al Qaeda have been ""decimated.""

President Barack Obama said the U.S. and its allies must strip away any legitimacy that Islamic State and al-Qaeda claim by portraying themselves as religious movements.

Obama, who has come under criticism from Republicans who say he avoids acknowledging the Muslim roots of extremist groups, said terrorists use religion as a recruiting tool by portraying the U.S. and European nations as being at war with Islam.

“We must never accept the premise they put forward, because it is a lie,” Obama said Wednesday in Washington on the second day of a White House summit on combating extremism. “They are not religious leaders. They’re terrorists. And we are not at war with Islam. We are at war with people who have perverted Islam.”

At the summit, the Obama administration is convening representatives of Muslim organizations, law enforcement officials and local political leaders to swap ideas about how to stem root causes of extremism. It also has invited leaders from overseas to take part.

Brainwashing

Obama said civic leaders must recognize that Islamic State and al-Qaeda “deliberately target their propaganda in the hopes of reaching and brainwashing young Muslims” through videos, social media and other online outlets. He said the one way to counter that is to alleviate the alienation and poverty that are the extremists’ best recruiting tool.

In the U.S., he said, local and federal authorities must make sure that Muslims aren’t isolated and that they are welcomed and integrated into society.

“Muslim Americans feel they have been unfairly targeted,” he said. “We have to be sure that abuses stop, are not repeated, that we do not stigmatize entire communities.”

Former Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore, who is chairman of a political action committee aimed at electing Republicans, called the conference a “farce” in a statement and said the administration should be targeting terrorists rather than offering “pie-in-the-sky social welfare programs” to Muslims here and overseas.

Muslim Outreach

The administration’s strategy is also aimed at drawing in the domestic Muslim leaders who Obama is leaning on to identify and isolate potentially violent extremists. Yet some groups say they remain suspicious about the administration’s motivation.

The Muslim Advocates, an Oakland Calif.-based group that that was invited to a White House meeting earlier this month, expressed concern that Obama’s requests for “partnerships” with Muslim community and religious leaders is code for requiring leaders to play a law enforcement role.

They also blasted Obama for focusing too narrowly on Muslims, a decision that the group says reinforces a negative stereotype that Islam and terror are linked.

“This whole day is focused on American Muslims, frankly,” Farhana Khera, the group’s executive director, said in a telephone interview. “It strikes at the core of what we are as Americans.”

On Cuba:

Bush argued against lifting the Cuban embargo, something Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called for during the Urban League forum.

""I think it's important if you're going to aspire to be president of the United States, you should aspire to be president of all people,"" Bush said.

""We need a strategy that narrows their influence, where we regain our position in Iraq and Syria. Not to be boots on the ground, fighting the fight directly. But training [the Syrian Free Army],"" he said.

`` If our military commanders tell us that we need ground forces to defeat ISIL , which is a threat to the United States , so be it , '' he said .

For months , ISIS has been facing off with the Peshmerga -- armed fighters who protect Iraqi Kurdistan -- to the west of Kirkuk . It had gone into areas on Kirkuk 's outskirts , but not the central city .
Heavily armed militants attacked an abandoned hotel in central Kirkuk that local police had used as their headquarters .
Peshmerga and Kurdish anti-terror units later raided the hotel , wresting control of it from the militants and killing three of them , according to Peshmerga sources . In addition , two suicide bombers detonated themselves in an attempt to keep the Kurdish forces out .
Also Friday , ISIS militants took over Maktab Khalid , an area about 12 miles southwest of Kirkuk , after heavy clashes with the Peshmerga .
Among those killed was Brig . Gen. Shirko Fateh , the highest-ranking operational commander of the Peshmerga brigade located in Kirkuk .
Photos posted by ISIS purportedly show the group 's militants in control of parts of south and southwest Kirkuk , burning tents that had been used by Peshmerga troops .
The U.S. military said Friday that an ISIS chemical weapons expert was killed during a coalition strike late last week .
Abu Malik worked in Saddam Hussein 's chemical weapons program before joining al Qaeda in 2005 , U.S. Central Command said .
`` His death is expected to temporarily degrade and disrupt the terrorist network and diminish ( ISIS ' ) ability to potentially produce and use chemical weapons against innocent people , '' the military said .
There is no public evidence that ISIS has a dedicated weapons of mass destruction program .
But U.S. Central Command said : `` His past training and experience provided the terrorist group with expertise to pursue a chemical weapons capability . ''
Kirkuk is a strategically important city in the months-long fight , one that has pitted ISIS against the Peshmerga , Iraqi government troops and an international coalition that has carried out airstrikes against the terrorist group .
Kirkuk , in northeast Iraq , is located on top of some of the country 's largest oil reserves .
It is one of the few notable cities -- apart from the region of Kurdistan and its capital , Irbil -- in northern Iraq that have n't fallen to ISIS . Part of its significance stems from the fact its oil reserves are almost as much as those in southern Iraq .
The Kurds and the central Iraqi government in Baghdad have long wrangled over control of those reserves , with each side wanting to keep hold of them . ISIS , which relies heavily on revenue from oil smuggling to fund its operations , has been coveting them , too .
Peshmerga forces took over the Kirkuk area in June when the Iraqi army crumbled in the face of ISIS ' advances and have played a vital role in defending it from ISIS since .
In December , ISIS claimed responsibility for a suicide car bomb attack there that killed at least 17 people and injured more than 20 . The attack , according to ISIS , was meant to send a message to the Kurdish people and Peshmerga fighters .
Still , Kirkuk is hardly the only place that has seen recent fighting -- which may be part of ISIS ' rationale for Friday 's attack there .
The group has been fending off an offensive from Peshmerga fighters around Mosul , Iraq 's second-largest city and a focal point for all sides in the conflict , that has left the Sunni extremist group on its heels .
The city of 1.5 million people on the Tigris River has been held by ISIS since June . ISIS has invested heavily in governing the city . Its leader , Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi , pronounced his leadership of the caliphate at the Grand Mosque there in July .
Kurdish officials say that as long as ISIS holds Mosul , it threatens Kurdistan . Likewise , neither the government in Baghdad nor its coalition partners can rest while terrorists occupy Iraq 's second-largest city .
Peshmerga forces have made steady progress against ISIS north and west of Mosul over the past two months .
They have taken some 3,000 square kilometers ( 1,160 square miles ) of the Sinjar area , as well as the area around the Mosul Dam , choking off access routes and threatening ISIS ' main resupply routes .
There 's little doubt , though , that ISIS remains a very real force , and threat , in much of Iraq .
The group , which calls itself the Islamic State , still controls a vast swath of that Middle Eastern nation and neighboring Syria . Its goal is to have a vast caliphate under its strict version of Sharia law , with its followers proving they will stop at nothing -- having been blamed for the large-scale killings of civilians , mass kidnappings and forcing women and girls to become sex slaves -- during its quest .
That violent campaign continued Friday , and not just in Kirkuk .
Dozens of gunmen believed to be from ISIS faced off Friday morning about 175 miles ( 285 kilometers ) away in central Ramadi , police and health officials in that city said .
Several hours later , that onslaught had been foiled and 20 gunmen were dead , according to the officials .
Elsewhere in Ramadi , a suicide car bomb explosion at an Iraqi army checkpoint killed one soldier and wounded six others .
Violence flared in other parts of Iraq as well that , while it has n't been tied to ISIS , is further proof of the country 's unsettled state .
Six explosions went off Friday around Baghdad , leaving at least seven dead and 23 wounded , according to police officials .
The deadliest such blast was in Bab Al Sharji , a busy commercial area in central Baghdad , leaving three dead and 10 hurt .","Amman, Jordan (CNN) ISIS militants have attacked Kirkuk in northern Iraq, an effort that might be an earnest attempt to capture the key oil-rich city or perhaps to divert Kurdish troops fighting to capture the Islamist extremist group's stronghold of Mosul.

For months, ISIS has been facing off with the Peshmerga -- armed fighters who protect Iraqi Kurdistan -- to the west of Kirkuk. It had gone into areas on Kirkuk's outskirts, but not the central city.

Until now, apparently.

Chemical weapons expert killed, U.S. says

The U.S. military said Friday that an ISIS chemical weapons expert was killed during a coalition strike late last week.

Abu Malik worked in Saddam Hussein's chemical weapons program before joining al Qaeda in 2005, U.S. Central Command said.

He was killed January 24 near Mosul.

""His death is expected to temporarily degrade and disrupt the terrorist network and diminish (ISIS') ability to potentially produce and use chemical weapons against innocent people,"" the military said.

There is no public evidence that ISIS has a dedicated weapons of mass destruction program.

Oil reserves make Kirkuk a big prize

Kirkuk is a strategically important city in the months-long fight, one that has pitted ISIS against the Peshmerga, Iraqi government troops and an international coalition that has carried out airstrikes against the terrorist group.

Kirkuk, in northeast Iraq, is located on top of some of the country's largest oil reserves.

It is one of the few notable cities -- apart from the region of Kurdistan and its capital, Irbil -- in northern Iraq that haven't fallen to ISIS. Part of its significance stems from the fact its oil reserves are almost as much as those in southern Iraq.

The Kurds and the central Iraqi government in Baghdad have long wrangled over control of those reserves, with each side wanting to keep hold of them. ISIS, which relies heavily on revenue from oil smuggling to fund its operations, has been coveting them, too.

Peshmerga forces took over the Kirkuk area in June when the Iraqi army crumbled in the face of ISIS' advances and have played a vital role in defending it from ISIS since.

In December, ISIS claimed responsibility for a suicide car bomb attack there that killed at least 17 people and injured more than 20. The attack, according to ISIS, was meant to send a message to the Kurdish people and Peshmerga fighters.

Peshmerga progress

Still, Kirkuk is hardly the only place that has seen recent fighting -- which may be part of ISIS' rationale for Friday's attack there.

The group has been fending off an offensive from Peshmerga fighters around Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city and a focal point for all sides in the conflict, that has left the Sunni extremist group on its heels.

The city of 1.5 million people on the Tigris River has been held by ISIS since June. ISIS has invested heavily in governing the city. Its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, pronounced his leadership of the caliphate at the Grand Mosque there in July.

Kurdish officials say that as long as ISIS holds Mosul, it threatens Kurdistan. Likewise, neither the government in Baghdad nor its coalition partners can rest while terrorists occupy Iraq's second-largest city.

Peshmerga forces have made steady progress against ISIS north and west of Mosul over the past two months.

They have taken some 3,000 square kilometers (1,160 square miles) of the Sinjar area, as well as the area around the Mosul Dam, choking off access routes and threatening ISIS' main resupply routes.

Officials: Iraqi forces fend off Ramadi attack

There's little doubt, though, that ISIS remains a very real force, and threat, in much of Iraq.

The group, which calls itself the Islamic State, still controls a vast swath of that Middle Eastern nation and neighboring Syria. Its goal is to have a vast caliphate under its strict version of Sharia law, with its followers proving they will stop at nothing -- having been blamed for the large-scale killings of civilians, mass kidnappings and forcing women and girls to become sex slaves -- during its quest.

That violent campaign continued Friday, and not just in Kirkuk.

Dozens of gunmen believed to be from ISIS faced off Friday morning about 175 miles (285 kilometers) away in central Ramadi, police and health officials in that city said.

Several hours later, that onslaught had been foiled and 20 gunmen were dead, according to the officials.

Elsewhere in Ramadi, a suicide car bomb explosion at an Iraqi army checkpoint killed one soldier and wounded six others.

Violence flared in other parts of Iraq as well that, while it hasn't been tied to ISIS, is further proof of the country's unsettled state.

Six explosions went off Friday around Baghdad, leaving at least seven dead and 23 wounded, according to police officials.

The deadliest such blast was in Bab Al Sharji, a busy commercial area in central Baghdad, leaving three dead and 10 hurt.",www.cnn.com,left,7iXvWRXRFUY0lJbQ

As President Barack Obama prepares to unveil his strategy for turning back ISIL ’ s gains in Syria and Iraq , the headlines will most likely focus on expanding U.S. airstrikes and challenges of defeating the group without involving American troops .
But one potentially critical part of the battle against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant also seems poised for a big new push : working to keep foreign fighters — including Americans — from joining the group in the first place .
Officials and outside experts say an essential part of fighting ISIL , Al Qaeda and similar groups is undercutting their propaganda on social media and elsewhere , while identifying and dissuading Americans and foreigners who might be considering travel to join up with such groups or — even worse — trying to emulate them at home .
So far , at least two Americans have been killed fighting for ISIL in the Iraq/Syria region , according to U.S. officials . Dozens of other U.S. citizens are being tracked fighting with that or other radical groups .
Past U.S. efforts at what the government calls “ countering violent extremism , ” or “ CVE , ” have been ham-handed , understaffed and underfunded , former officials from both the Obama and George W. Bush administrations say . They only get attention from senior policymakers in the wake of highly publicized terrorist incidents .
“ We need a much more effective counternarrative , ” Obama conceded in an interview aired Sunday on “ Meet the Press . ”
There was interest at the beginning of the Obama administration , but it has tailed off .
“ The people that were interested in this stuff have moved on from it , ” said former State Department official Will McCants , now with the Brookings Institution . “ It was always a box-checking activity . There was not a serious effort to build a real program in the U.S . The strategy paper was written and then the air went out of it completely . ”
Some lawmakers share the perception that the administration ’ s CVE efforts are not well-focused . A House subcommittee is set to hold a hearing Wednesday on the “ foreign fighter ” problem . Staffers are already probing executive branch agencies to prepare for future hearings on the dangers posed by recruiting of Americans and weaknesses in the government ’ s response .
“ I am concerned we are not doing enough to combat the rising threat of domestic radicalization , ” said House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul ( R-Texas ) . “ These efforts have never been more important , and my committee will be taking a hard look at what the administration is doing on this front . ”
Notwithstanding Obama ’ s concession about the need to strengthen the counternarrative , the White House contends that the administration has been aggressive about undermining terrorist messages and recruitment .
“ CVE continues to be a priority for this administration , ” said National Security Council spokesman Ned Price . He pointed to a State Department office “ engaged in a sustained campaign against Syria and Iraq-based terrorists ’ online messaging , in part to combat their ability to recruit foreign fighters , ” and Department of Homeland Security efforts to promote “ community-based activities to strengthen resilience in communities targeted by violent extremist recruitment . ”
Obama administration officials acknowledge that ISIL is now producing polished Web videos and social media messages leaps and bounds beyond the grainy video releases and scratchy audiotapes Al Qaeda has long been known for .
ISIL “ operates the most sophisticated propaganda machine of any extremist group … as a result , ISIL threatens to outpace Al Qaeda as the dominant voice of influence in the global extremist movement , ” National Counterterrorism Center Director Matthew Olsen said last week at the Brookings Institution .
In a separate discussion with reporters Friday , Olsen said NCTC has a “ radical extremist messaging ” group that closely tracks social media posts . “ We actually do spend a significant amount of time on those questions , ” he said .
But converting knowledge about radical groups ’ propaganda into effective countermessages has proved harder than just sweeping up the info , Olsen said . “ That is an area where I do think we can spend additional time and resources… . I think there ’ s an opportunity for more work to be done in countermessaging , ” he said .
That doesn ’ t mean the U.S. is the best messenger . The improved “ counternarrative ” needed to defeat ISIL “ can ’ t come from us , ” Obama said on NBC .
An office Obama created at the State Department three years ago , the Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications , is attempting to counter ISIL ’ s sophisticated and prolific social media presence . In recent weeks , it has been promoting a mock recruiting video for the Islamic State , including extremely graphic images of the group executing Muslims and carrying out a suicide bombing in a mosque .
“ We have basically a negative role , bringing the light to shine on the adversary ’ s action , principally using their own words and deeds against them , ” said a State Department official , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
“ In a political campaign , you have the guy who does the ‘ Morning in America ’ stuff… and the other guy you hire to do attack ads and opposition research . We ’ re the other guy….Our work is to be attack dogs . ”
The counterterrorism social media shop , which includes personnel on loan from various government agencies , has been feeding out information in Arabic , Urdu , Punjabi and Somali for some time . In December , the office began posting in English , largely in response to concerns that ISIL and other groups were doing more recruiting in Europe . “ We identified they were seeking to kind of metastasize and grow beyond the Middle Eastern languages and the Middle East audiences [ and try ] to reach radical young men in the West , ” the State official said .
Critics have faulted the office for sometimes engaging in pointless trolling with militants who seem unlikely to be swayed by U.S. government messages . However , the State official defended the practice . “ You ’ re trying to challenge the audience that person is trying to reach , ” the official said .
The broader anti-extremism effort has suffered from a lack of central authority in the U.S. government , especially when compared to those involved in planning responses like military strikes , one former official said .
“ When you ’ re looking at use of hard power , there ’ s accountability . The buck stops with a particular person . With regard to soft power , it doesn ’ t , ” said Farah Pandith , who stepped down in January at the U.S. ’ s Special Representative to Muslim Communities and previously served on the National Security Council under Bush .
The official who coordinated governmentwide policy on countering extremism until last spring , Quintan Wiktorowicz , said the Obama administration had crafted good policies on the issue but never tied much funding to the effort .
Instead of hiring staff to work with U.S. communities susceptible to terrorist recruiting , the administration decided to have U.S . Attorneys take the lead , even if federal prosecutors are not the ideal individuals to reach out to those in contact with troubled youth .
Wiktorowicz said the main problem with relying on U.S . Attorneys is that the anti-radicalization effort seems certain to get short shrift . “ If you think about the roles and responsibilities of U.S . Attorneys , they can ’ t possibly take on that function in a really robust way , ” he said .
Some have questioned how much effort and money should be invested in fighting ISIL recruitment in the U.S. given how relatively rare that is . U.S. government officials say their best estimate at the moment is that about a dozen Americans are fighting with the group . However , the broader picture is murky . About 100 Americans are believed to have traveled to Syria or Iraq for reasons the U.S. government deems suspicious .
By contrast , Europeans are dealing with larger populations of citizens making their way to groups like ISIL and its Al Qaeda counterpart , Al-Nusra . According to European intelligence estimates , about 800 Britons , 600 French , 400 Germans and about 200 Belgians are believed to have gone to the region to fight as part of one of the radical groups .
“ I ’ m not really worried about the threat they pose when they come back . Our security apparatus will be all over them — and a lot of guys will not come back , ” McCants said of the American recruits . “ My greater concern is why are they going in the first place ? That to me is the big countering violent extremism question that isn ’ t being asked yet . ”
“ We have to be more sophisticated about this , ” Pandith said . “ This ideology is preying upon Muslim Millennials who are having a crisis of identity . If you don ’ t get that , you ’ ll never be able to get ahead of that . ”
A report issued in 2012 warned that strategies used to fight Islamic radicalization problems in Europe might be ill-suited to the U.S. and could even backfire as some U.S. anti-drug programs did .
“ Aggressively informing U.S. communities about al-Qaeda propaganda might result in a similar outcome as the War on Drug ’ s D.A.R.E . program ( obviously , on a much smaller scale ) as a result of greater exposure to al-Qaeda ’ s message and the repeated warnings to stay away from it , which only encourages curiosity , ” said the Foreign Policy Research Institute paper , written by McCants and Clinton Watts .
More aggressive efforts to thwart recruiting raise other thorny questions as well . Muslim groups have complained bitterly about FBI sting operations that critics say sometimes target impressionable teenagers and offer people fake bombs and high-powered weapons they could never acquire or design on their own . However , using intelligence gathered online to stage some kind of intervention through religious leaders or school officials could present privacy and civil liberties problems .
“ Legally , even perceptually , people are very , very uncomfortable with going into that space , ” said Wiktorowicz . “ There needs to be some adjustment in terms of being open to using softer instruments for individuals who have not crossed that line where there ’ s a high potential to draw that individual back through other forms of interventions … To some extent , we have not been willing to invest the energy and resources to have that conversation about what we really are and are not legally allowed to do . ”
Another central problem for the U.S. in the current anti-terror fight is that U.S. foreign policy lacks a central theme that can be easily explained and have appeal to potential terrorist converts , some critics say .
“ If we don ’ t persuade some kid trying to decide whether or not to strap on a suicide vest in the boonies of Yemen or Iraq not to do it , he ’ s going to do it… . So , where ’ s a narrative that will persuade these folks ? ” former Rep. Jane Harman ( D-Calif. ) asked at the Aspen Security Forum in July .
“ I ’ m not saying it is U.S. foreign policy , but the perception of our foreign policy in much of the Middle East is : ‘ Don ’ t Do Stupid Stuff , plus use drones , ’ ” she said . “ I don ’ t think that ’ s winning any heart or mind or any mind or heart . ”
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton struck a similar chord in an interview last month . “ We don ’ t even tell our own story very well these days , ” she said in an interview with The Atlantic . She later retreated from the comments .
Some warn that coming up with a narrative about the U.S. that appeals to Muslims in Europe or the Middle East could be difficult or impossible without major changes to American foreign policy that don ’ t currently seem to be in the cards .
“ There isn ’ t a narrative because our policy sucks , ” said James Zogby of the Arab American Institute . “ We ’ re flying drones….We forget Abu Ghraib . We forget rendition . They don ’ t . You can ’ t alter the narrative if you keep doing bad stuff….They don ’ t dislike our values , they just don ’ t think they apply to them . ”
Many analysts argue that much of the Bush administration ’ s post-9/11 effort at counterterrorist propaganda — largely messages about how integrated and respected Muslims are in American public life — fell flat because it focused on the U.S. rather than the weaknesses of Al Qaeda and its allies . Trying to sell the average man on the street in many majority-Muslim countries is a fool ’ s errand that isn ’ t the easiest way to undercut terrorist groups like ISIL , those experts say .
“ CVE fails when it ’ s about selling us . It ’ s not about selling us , it ’ s about countering the jihadis ’ narrative , ” said one ex-official , who asserted that $ 1 billion has been spent on trying to sway Pakistani public opinion — to little avail . “ The idea that the Pakistanis are going to like us anytime soon is just preposterous . It ’ s the wrong message . ”
One expert said the brutality of ISIL ’ s recent activities present a good opportunity for the U.S. to step up its counter-extremism game .
“ ISIS presents a huge , fat target for those who want to counter the narrative , ” said former State Department counterterrorism coordinator Daniel Benjamin . “ The mayhem they ’ re causing , the bloodshed they ’ re causing is extraordinary and it ’ s really quite urgent to get on this.…It ’ s important to be taking this seriously now . ”","One critical part will be keeping Americans from joining ISIL in the first place. | Getty The propaganda war Obama is losing

In recent weeks, it has been promoting a mock recruiting video for the Islamic State, including extremely graphic images of the group executing Muslims and carrying out a suicide bombing in a mosque.

According to European intelligence estimates, about 800 Britons, 600 French, 400 Germans and about 200 Belgians are believed to have gone to the region to fight as part of one of the radical groups.

“I’m not really worried about the threat they pose when they come back. Our security apparatus will be all over them — and a lot of guys will not come back,” McCants said of the American recruits. “My greater concern is why are they going in the first place? That to me is the big countering violent extremism question that isn’t being asked yet.”

“We have to be more sophisticated about this,” Pandith said. “This ideology is preying upon Muslim Millennials who are having a crisis of identity. If you don’t get that, you’ll never be able to get ahead of that.”

A report issued in 2012 warned that strategies used to fight Islamic radicalization problems in Europe might be ill-suited to the U.S. and could even backfire as some U.S. anti-drug programs did.

“Aggressively informing U.S. communities about al-Qaeda propaganda might result in a similar outcome as the War on Drug’s D.A.R.E. program (obviously, on a much smaller scale) as a result of greater exposure to al-Qaeda’s message and the repeated warnings to stay away from it, which only encourages curiosity,” said the Foreign Policy Research Institute paper, written by McCants and Clinton Watts.

More aggressive efforts to thwart recruiting raise other thorny questions as well. Muslim groups have complained bitterly about FBI sting operations that critics say sometimes target impressionable teenagers and offer people fake bombs and high-powered weapons they could never acquire or design on their own. However, using intelligence gathered online to stage some kind of intervention through religious leaders or school officials could present privacy and civil liberties problems.

“Legally, even perceptually, people are very, very uncomfortable with going into that space ,” said Wiktorowicz. “There needs to be some adjustment in terms of being open to using softer instruments for individuals who have not crossed that line where there’s a high potential to draw that individual back through other forms of interventions … To some extent, we have not been willing to invest the energy and resources to have that conversation about what we really are and are not legally allowed to do.”

WHAT’S THE MESSAGE?

Another central problem for the U.S. in the current anti-terror fight is that U.S. foreign policy lacks a central theme that can be easily explained and have appeal to potential terrorist converts, some critics say.

“If we don’t persuade some kid trying to decide whether or not to strap on a suicide vest in the boonies of Yemen or Iraq not to do it, he’s going to do it…. So, where’s a narrative that will persuade these folks?” former Rep. Jane Harman (D-Calif.) asked at the Aspen Security Forum in July.

“I’m not saying it is U.S. foreign policy, but the perception of our foreign policy in much of the Middle East is: ‘Don’t Do Stupid Stuff, plus use drones,’” she said. “I don’t think that’s winning any heart or mind or any mind or heart.”

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton struck a similar chord in an interview last month. “We don’t even tell our own story very well these days,” she said in an interview with The Atlantic. She later retreated from the comments.

Some warn that coming up with a narrative about the U.S. that appeals to Muslims in Europe or the Middle East could be difficult or impossible without major changes to American foreign policy that don’t currently seem to be in the cards.

“There isn’t a narrative because our policy sucks,” said James Zogby of the Arab American Institute. “We’re flying drones….We forget Abu Ghraib. We forget rendition. They don’t. You can’t alter the narrative if you keep doing bad stuff….They don’t dislike our values, they just don’t think they apply to them.”

Many analysts argue that much of the Bush administration’s post-9/11 effort at counterterrorist propaganda — largely messages about how integrated and respected Muslims are in American public life — fell flat because it focused on the U.S. rather than the weaknesses of Al Qaeda and its allies. Trying to sell the average man on the street in many majority-Muslim countries is a fool’s errand that isn’t the easiest way to undercut terrorist groups like ISIL, those experts say.

“CVE fails when it’s about selling us. It’s not about selling us, it’s about countering the jihadis’ narrative,” said one ex-official, who asserted that $1 billion has been spent on trying to sway Pakistani public opinion — to little avail. “The idea that the Pakistanis are going to like us anytime soon is just preposterous. It’s the wrong message.”

One expert said the brutality of ISIL’s recent activities present a good opportunity for the U.S. to step up its counter-extremism game.

“ISIS presents a huge, fat target for those who want to counter the narrative,” said former State Department counterterrorism coordinator Daniel Benjamin. “The mayhem they’re causing, the bloodshed they’re causing is extraordinary and it’s really quite urgent to get on this.…It’s important to be taking this seriously now.”",www.politico.com,left,vH4FSd2d0YRMEnIA

How much of this is due to Trump’s influence?

As with any war and, indeed, a great many other occurrences during any administration, the personal credit or blame that accrues to a president is widely exaggerated. The people winning this war are the U.S. air crews and special operators killing the terrorists as well as the coalition forces — principally local militias and the Kurdish Peshmerga fighters — who have paid for the ground won from the terrorists in blood.

According to an activist linked to the Free Syrian Army who also saw the body and travel document , McCain was among three foreign jihadis fighting with ISIS who died during the battle .
Given the group ’ s well-cultivated reputation as a known terrorist organization more brutal than al Qaeda , it ’ s certainly jarring to read Western nationals , let alone American citizens , would join their ranks . Perhaps this is why McCain ’ s own cousin has denied the rumors , claiming instead he was “ a loving person ” who would never “ support a terrorist group like that ” :
Maybe not . But either way , he ’ s dead . And what ’ s more , his own uncle ( and US officials ) believe he was a terrorist ( via CNN ) :
The man 's uncle , Ken McCain , said that his nephew had gone to fight as a jihadi and that the U.S. State Department told the family Monday about the death . Like U.S. officials , the group characterized McCain as an ISIS fighter and said he was killed battling al-Nusra Front , an al Qaeda-linked organization that the U.S. government has blacklisted as a foreign terror organization .
He was also writing empathetic posts on Facebook about the organization , according to one expert familiar with the case , which is why he was clearly on terrorist watch lists :
U.S. counterterrorism investigators had been looking into McCain 's activities for some time before his death , one U.S. official said . He was on a list of Americans who are believed to have joined militant groups and who would be stopped and subjected to additional scrutiny if he traveled , according to the official .
Meanwhile , McCain is almost certainly not the only American defending and fighting for ISIS , although it ’ s difficult to gauge just how many actually are . As of last June , Richard Engels reported that the number is estimated to be somewhere around 70 :
Americans in # isis . US officials say about seventy US fighters have passed through Syria and about a dozen are currently active there . — Richard Engel ( @ RichardEngel ) June 30 , 2014
But more recently , the US State Department believes maybe more Americans have openly declared war against the stars and stripes :
`` Dozens of Americans , perhaps up to 100 , '' are among those who have tried to join various militant groups there , State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf told CNN .

Perhaps this is why McCain’s own cousin has denied the rumors, claiming instead he was “a loving person” who would never “support a terrorist group like that”:

Maybe not. But either way, he’s dead. And what’s more, his own uncle (and US officials) believe he was a terrorist (via CNN):

The man's uncle, Ken McCain, said that his nephew had gone to fight as a jihadi and that the U.S. State Department told the family Monday about the death. Like U.S. officials, the group characterized McCain as an ISIS fighter and said he was killed battling al-Nusra Front, an al Qaeda-linked organization that the U.S. government has blacklisted as a foreign terror organization.

He was also writing empathetic posts on Facebook about the organization, according to one expert familiar with the case, which is why he was clearly on terrorist watch lists:

U.S. counterterrorism investigators had been looking into McCain's activities for some time before his death, one U.S. official said. He was on a list of Americans who are believed to have joined militant groups and who would be stopped and subjected to additional scrutiny if he traveled, according to the official.

Meanwhile, McCain is almost certainly not the only American defending and fighting for ISIS, although it’s difficult to gauge just how many actually are. As of last June, Richard Engels reported that the number is estimated to be somewhere around 70:

Americans in #isis. US officials say about seventy US fighters have passed through Syria and about a dozen are currently active there. — Richard Engel (@RichardEngel) June 30, 2014

But more recently, the US State Department believes maybe more Americans have openly declared war against the stars and stripes:

""Dozens of Americans, perhaps up to 100,"" are among those who have tried to join various militant groups there, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf told CNN.

Needless to say, these defectors speak English, possess US passports, and have deep ties to the country.

Let us hope they never come back.",www.townhall.com,right,wyLa2qnVpApNadF6
